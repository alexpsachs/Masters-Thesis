    "GrantCodesCodes": "I like that idea, if you have any specific suggestions on how to go about that let me know. I'll try and write something up soon. I'm thinking something along the lines of a string property in the field definition that allows you to specify a list of additional classes.\n. I like the idea of being able to specify a template, that would allow this directive to stay lean while being extensible with custom form elements.\n. @millette That sounds pretty cool to me. I think its a separate concept, here I'm discussing how to layout the fields displayed, and that would be more like branching sets of logic.\n. Thanks I'll check this out this week.\n. Looks good actually, thanks. I'll tag a release later this week though.\n. Looks good thanks\n. I'll add that soon, hopefully the demo site helps in the mean time. While they're a little complex, the two important files to look at for the demo site are these:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/blob/master/src/views/home.html\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/blob/master/src/views/home.js\nThe options set in the html are defined in the home controller.\n<formly-form result=\"formData\"\n             fields=\"formFields\"\n             options=\"formOptions\"\n             ng-submit=\"onSubmit()\">\n</formly-form>\n. The example has been expanded quite significantly, and documentation of each feature added. Let me know if you think we need more but I'm going to close for now.\n. This would take the submit button out of the form component which I'm not sure is a great choice. Any ideas on how you would handle this?\n. For the first question, you can add a $watch to the result object you pass in. Once it changes then you'll have your event trigger.\nFor the second question there is a hideSubmit option which you can pass to the formOptions\n. Thanks, I'll set aside some time tomorrow to check these out.\n. @t8g For both Radio and Select the idea is to only store the data necessary to recreate the values input into the form. For radio inputs the only important data is value which is what html(and the AngularJS component) use to display a radio input. For the Select the default AngularJS component uses a object or value inside of an array. \nFrom formly-field-select.html:\nng-options=\"option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\"\nFrom the AngularJS docs for select\n\nvalue: local variable which will refer to each item in the array or each property value of object during iteration.\n\nAngular uses the object as the value which is selected when you choose an option. In our case, since we're using their component, I'm using their structure. It looks like their component automatically generates values for each select item. However I don't know a way to get that value, nor use it to recreate the state of the form.\nhtml\n<select class=\"form-control ng-pristine ng-valid ng-valid-required\" id=\"formlyselect9\" ng-model=\"value\" ng-required=\"options.required\" ng-disabled=\"options.disabled\" ng-init=\"value = options.options[options.default]\" ng-options=\"option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\">\n    <option value=\"?\" selected=\"selected\"></option>\n    <optgroup label=\"inefficiently\">\n        <option value=\"0\">Car</option>\n        <option value=\"1\">Helicopter</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">Sport Utility Vehicle</option>\n    </optgroup>\n    <optgroup label=\"efficiently\">\n        <option value=\"3\">Bicycle</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">Skateboard</option>\n        <option value=\"5\">Walk</option>\n        <option value=\"6\">Bus</option>\n        <option value=\"7\">Scooter</option>\n        <option value=\"8\">Train</option>\n        <option value=\"9\">Hot Air Baloon</option>\n    </optgroup>\n</select>\nFor your second question thats now handled and pushed to 0.0.10\n. Good question, you use the index of the element in the list.\n. Looks good, thanks\n. Updated to 0.0.10\n. Looks good, thanks\n. Whats the jshint error?\n. ah I see, yeah I think it would be a good idea to change this.\n. @trunghaiy I tried to reproduce this issue but as far as I can tell newer versions of JSHint have es5 mode turned on by default.\n\nIf you're still seeing this error then you should update your version of JSHint. Since 2.0.0 the es5 option has been enabled by default...\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10936180/suppress-expected-an-identifier-and-instead-saw-default-a-reserved-word-in\n\nYou can read more about that here:\nhttp://jslinterrors.com/expected-an-identifier-and-instead-saw-a-a-reserved-word/\n. Let me know if you really need this to be es3 compatible, as far as I can tell you only need this if you're targeting IE6, which I don't think I'd like to worry about supporting if I can avoid it.\n. This looks great, do you mind updating the newly minted docs as well. Thanks!\n. Hey Kent, The first part of your pull request for hide looks great, but I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way to handle the watches. I'm seeing 6 calls to the watch method in its current implementation no matter what is changed on the scope. I believe its 2 calls per hideExpression, per scope change of any kind to the form scope, not just the results field. I don't think this would be a major bottle neck, but I spent a little time trying a few options to see if we could get it down.\nIn addition, the watcher code only runs when the form is instantiated so if you modify the form definition it won't rerun and the functionality is broken. Editing the form definition is an edge case, but I'd like to create some sort of form construction tool in the future using this library, so I see that being an issue as well.\nI tried this the code below, it just watched result, deeply, and if there are changes it loops through the fields to see if they have hide expressions. I don't think its the most elegant solution, but it does work around those two problems listed above. What do you think, I'm open for discussion! My only concern with my solution is looping through all the fields every time...\njavascript\n    //formly-form.js\n    ...\ncontroller: function($scope, $element) {\n            $scope.$watch('result', function(newValue) {\n                console.log('result changed');\n                angular.forEach($scope.fields, function(field, index) {\n                    if (field.hideExpression) {\n                        var getter = $parse(field.hideExpression);\n                        field.hide = getter($scope.result);\n                    }\n                });\n            }, true);\n        },\n    ...\n. I agree with @jhr007, but I think it would be cool to create a set of custom templates that are compatible with the library to enable inline editing. I'd like to keep the library bare bones and then allow you to swap dependencies based on the type of forms you need.\n. @kentcdodds thanks for putting that together, its all pushed up and a new version tagged at 0.0.10\n. Actually the only issue I just realized is we need to update the Readme with documentation on how to use the new feature. If you get a chance to look at that it would be helpful. Otherwise I'll try and get to it later this week.\nI haven't done too many pull requests as a repo owner myself, so I think we did ok :smile: \n. Nevermind, I think its all in the readme...\n. This is awesome, I'll try and get this in today.\n. Ok this is merged in, but I think i did it wrong so this PR didn't get registered as merged...\nAlso I moved the provider into its own file in a provider folder and with a more descriptive name so its clear when being injected.\n. 0.0.11 btw\n. Hmm, I did a little digging and it looks like its the default, which is why the minifier removes it... As you'll read, people sometimes rely on it to style or for js selectors. I think I'd agree that it should be there, even if it's not technically necessary. Anyone else have an opinion?\nIssue calling this out:\nhttps://github.com/kangax/html-minifier/issues/105\n. Fixed in 0.0.12\n. Yeah lets hold off with 1.2 ngMessages for now. We can start on a new branch with 1.3 support if someone would like to take a crack at it.\n. Sorry about the styleguide stuff, I've elaborated in #100 \n. Ha, awesome, thanks!\n. Seems like this would work for number and/or email templates, I've never used it before?\nI think this would be a good inclusion either way, can you update the readme and changelog. I can run the build command once we're ready to tag a new release.\n. @inalgnu once you have this ready please change the target branch for this PR to 0.0.12 so I can easily merge this in. Thanks!\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository\n. Looking forward to getting this in but I'm closing this PR so that you can resubmit.\nBefore resubmitting please submit to branch 0.0.12 and add documentation for the new feature. Thanks!\n. Sounds good\n. This will be in 0.0.12\n. Closed with #39 \n. Hey Kent, I won't be able to get to this till Wed. You might be able to just create a new branch from the current formly master. Unless it builds on this one...\n. I'm seeing an error when I test this:\n- Check the joe checkbox\n- start typing in the This is a special form field text area\n- error: TypeError: Cannot set property 'field' of undefined\n. Looks good I'm ready to merge this but can you change the target branch from master to my new 0.0.12 branch.\nI can't do it but I think this describes how you can do it:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository\n. Closed via #39 \n. Agreed, ok\n. Yeah we have no issues with that, I've never used browserify but I know it's popular. Feel free to submit a PR and we'll drop it in.\n. Fair enough, I'll look into it soon.\n. Its published here: https://www.npmjs.org/package/angular-formly\nThis is my first node package so let me know if there are any problems.\n. <input type=\"date\"> is unsupported by most browsers at the moment and this library is focused on only using the native and/or vanilla angular components. You can definitely use one of the existing libraries like ui-bootstrap to achieve this with a custom form template.\nUI-Bootstrap date picker\nhttp://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/datepicker\nSupport for HTML5 date\nhttp://caniuse.com/input-datetime\nhttp://www.wufoo.com/html5/types/4-date.html\n. I haven't read through this very thoroughly yet but uniqueFormId should be present in the form options. Can you try this and see if adding helps resolve any conflicts?\n. @scull7 were you able to figure anything out yet? there is no safe variable in our code so I'm not 100% sure this is from our library.\nAlso, this looks like minified code, is the issue happening in your unminified code? It would be great to get a stack trace that had the actual file names in it.\n. Ok, going to close this for now...\n. @testuserx I agree that it would be nice to have this functionality. I've proposed it here: https://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/1\nThat being said, I don't really have any good solutions for it. For now this project is best for simple layouts only.\n. I like the idea of using ng-if as an alternative to ng-hide. Is there any reason to keep ng-hide?\nIn a future release I'd to move the template back into html, we can achieve the same string replacement effect, if we still need to, by loading via the template cache. We're doing this in formly-field currently. I don't like editing html in strings like this, it's just hard to read and work with imho. I don't mind making this change myself as I'm being the picky one here :)\nThis also breaks our ability to customize formly-form.html across builds, not that we were, but I'd like to leave that option open.\nI'm going to release it as-is in 0.0.15\n. Sounds good, those can be two separate initiatives. I think I have a good idea on how to separate the html. I'll tackle that in a future release.\n. I just mean for layout purposes, nothing to do with the way its implemented.\n. I see what you mean, but I don't think it needs to be customizable. Just in that column so that its clear its a configuration.\n. Lame, well this works for me thanks!\n. It seems like this might be a step in the direction of ditching the value property. Can we just use result.value going forward?\n. ha, good point. I'll create a new issue for that, but I think this is the right direction to move. Unless we have a good reason to keep it around I think it can go in a future release.\n. Agreed those are both solid options. Closing for now\n. Closing for now, please reopen if you continue seeing this issue.\n. Not positive but I think the fix you're looking for is resolved by #44. You can set the default value in options using the name of the option you pass in.\n. That would be awesome, the templates would be pretty easy to rewrite but I've never used Ionic myself.\n. @cfreyre I just added support in 0.0.14 for additional base templates. There is a little bit of build process customization but I can help with that if you need. Let me know if you plan on working on this. I'm going to reopen this task as I'd like to see it done either way.\n. Sure sounds like a good addition to me, the bootstrap templates are in their own folder. Please add it to the readme as well.\u00a0Let me know of you have any questions!\nOn Tue, Jul 29, 2014 at 3:48 AM, Jon Espen Kvisler\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHey, great project!\nWould have been cool if I could add help text to each field also (including radio/checkbox options), using e.g. .help-block (from bootstrap anyway). \nWhat do you think? I can probably have a go at it and submit a PR.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/52\n. Sounds good, I think that would be pretty easy to exclude add to the build process. I do like having the premise templates so that in many cases people can just drop things in and get started but I trust there are plenty of users who just want custom stuff. I'm happy to support both cases, though I think the default should be plain templates.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 29, 2014 at 8:49 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI think it would be good to actually separate things so much that this project had several builds with and without templates. On most of my projects I override the template types anyway, so I'd prefer to not have the templates in my code. I think this would be a good thing in general, just to separate things out a bit. We should also add a wiki article for how to create a custom template and show how easy it is. I think that would decrease the number of issues asking for changes to templates where a custom template would be better...\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/53\n. I actually already did a large amount of that work last release. There was a breaking change which defaulted the templates to plain. I don't use the same -tpls naming convention unfortunately, just .bootstrap I believe. -no-tpls sounds good to me.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 29, 2014 at 9:20 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nSeems reasonable. I'd say we'd want to have another output file that ended in no-tpls, what do you think?\nEventually, there could be a use case to support templates for more than just bootstrap. We could do style-it-yourself templates where we add some classes to allow customizability, and we could have pure.css templates, and I'm sure there are more. But if we separated these out into their own folders, it would encourage the community to contribute templates for their favorite css libraries. Each of these libraries could have its own build. To do that right, I think that we'd have a breaking change to default to the no templates output and then a {library}-tpls file for each template type. What do you think?\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/53#issuecomment-50500100\n. This looks awesome @jonespen, I'll make sure it's in the next release, 0.0.15.\n. Reopened as https://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/pull/56 in the 0.0.15 branch\n. One way to add this could be with a directive that feeds the typeahead data. You could use either formlyTemplateProvider or just override a single field with a template that uses the typeahead/http directive. Would that work in your case?\n. sorry been pretty busy this week. I'll look over this with you guys by Wed I believe\n. Sounds like this would be a separate build of formly dedicated to AngularStrap, at the very least. However since the functionality requested is above and beyond the base functionality of AngularStrap I'm not sure that it belongs anywhere other than a custom form field. Something that is tailored to your project, of course it could always be based on an AngularStrap/Formly build, but as @kentcdodds mentioned it would require custom templates across all fields, which wouldn't even be part of the AngularStrap build. I would see a AngularStrap build focusing on implementing their form related components, Timepicker, Datepicker, Select, and maybe typeahead. Anything beyond that wouldn't make a lot of sense in my opinion.\n. It just seems like excess to me, it certainly isn't an urgent issue but it feels like an extra moving/breakable part that could easily be simplified with direct access to the result or a getter.\n. Ha, absolutely agree. My lack of test writing experience is the major reason we don't have that yet, maybe it's time to learn..\n. You're more than welcome to do so. Let me know if you do get started or want some help writing tests.\n. I'm working on 0.0.15 right now, so today, just going to go through and test everything as thoroughly as i can here. What kind of stuff are you moving?\n. Ok, all yours. 0.0.16 (I messed up 15) is live!\n. Thanks, I'm taking a look as well. I'll let you know if figure anything out.\n. looks like it should go from:\n\nng-options=\"option.value as option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\"\nto\nng-options=\"option.name as option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\"\nDoes that work for you?\n. ha, no worries\nThe first value, select, if set, is the value thats bound. So option.value wasn't a real thing, and wasn't getting bound.\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/select\n\nselect: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent  element. If not specified, select expression will default to value.\n. Yeah #61 broke it, how did that get past our rigorous test suite! Easy fix at least :)\n. I can push this fix up\n. I could get behind that change\n. Looks like a good setup to me, how do I configure the symlinks, they don't seem to work out-of-the-box? I get 404's for all of the bower_components.\n. Can we change the ignore to the new location? src/bower-components\n\nOn Thu, Aug 21, 2014 at 3:58 PM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWhoops, because the symlink was called bower_components it was ignored via the .gitignore. I think I'm going to remove that from the git ignore. Another option would be to name the symlink different, but then it's a little confusing. Want to use the symlink so we can symlink the bower_components in the test directory as well...\nAnyway, what do you think about removing bower_components from the .gitignore?\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/pull/72#issuecomment-52996469\n. I'm confused, in this PR they are still located in src, are you saying you want to move them out of there? If we were to just leave them there, and change .gitignore from bower_components to src/bower_components it would allow the symlink to be wherever, assuming you had it at the top level?\n. Ok sounds good\n. Awesome, I'll take a look\n. looks great, merged\n. Ok, I\u2019ll jump on that shortly\n\nOn Fri, Aug 22, 2014 at 1:25 PM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@astrism looks like you have to setup travis-ci on this because I don't have admin access: https://travis-ci.org/profile/nimbly\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/73#issuecomment-53115848\n. Ok I enabled Travis CI.\n. Added\n. It's running now actually: https://travis-ci.org/nimbly/angular-formly/builds/33324189\n. Maybe global install? http://badsyntax.co/post/travis-ci-and-bower\n. Yeah i can do that\n. We're officially Passing!\n. I recently setup a custom text field and set the max length using the native maxlength attribute. For some reason ng-maxlength wasn't working for me at all.\nmaxlength=\"{{options.maxlength}}\"\nI think this would be a good addition to the templates.\n. Agreed, I never intended for this library to go too far above native Angular support for forms. For that kind of support I like the idea individual library plugins, i.e. UI-Bootstrap or Angular-Strap for their more enhanced UI components. It is my opinion that the base Formly should be UI agnostic if possible.\n. Yep, moving this discussion over there :)\n. I think we'd just be creating several repos which depend on this one. It would be good for this one to mention the others and maybe the demo would use the bootstrap one. The real question is should we do this in 0.1.0 or move it to a future release? I'm going to be out for a couple weeks traveling soon, hopefully none of this requires my urgent help, but I'll try and jump in when I can. @kentcdodds do you have any desire to own those repos, or we could even create a new org i suppose? This is turning out to be quite the project :)\n. Yeah I think I might do that, it'll make it easier to manage contributors and stuff.\n. Hey all, this is finally in progress! Currently the templates are pointing to the latest hash for angular-formly. The template repos as I have them are dependent on angular-formly, unlike the current standalone builds. I think that this structure allows for us to release extended templates like an angular-bootstrap template that can live side by side with the base template. I think this is a great setup, the only part I don't like is having to generate this file each time:\n\nangular.module('formly.render').config(function(formlyConfigProvider) {\n    'use strict';\n    var fields = [\n        'textarea', 'radio', 'select', 'number', 'checkbox',\n        'password', 'hidden', 'email', 'text'\n    ];\n    angular.forEach(fields, function(field) {\n        formlyConfigProvider.setTemplateUrl(field, 'fields/formly-field-' + field + '.html');\n    });\n});\nI feel like there might be a less verbose way of doing this, but I haven't thought of anything yet.\nNext I'll be removing templates from angular-formly, release angular-formly, then update the template repos and release them.\nHere are the repos:\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-vanilla\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap\n. @kentcdodds sounds good. I'm going to leave it for now.\nTemplates are now removed from angular-formly. Final remaining thing is updating the docs in angular-formly to mention the other repos. I won't get to it today so if anyone else has time feel free.\n. All done and released\n. The current structure defined in the docs for defining options is: \n{\n  \"name\": \"Walk\",\n  \"group\": \"low emissions\"\n}\nWhat you're suggesting wouldn't work with this setup and breaks our current demo page. Are you proposing we change this? I could use a little info as to why and a maybe update the pull request with the full change. I should be able to look at this in more detail on Wed, but thats why I made that change initially, and it worked well for the demo as well as being backwards compatible.\n. Just reread #60 and I see you want both name and value there, I think this makes sense. It's probably ok to break the backwards compatibility, but we'll need to update the docs and demo.\n{\n  \"name\": \"Yes, and I love it!\",\n  \"value\": \"yesyes\",\n  \"group\": \"positive vibes\"\n}\n. That works for me, we'll get this update in to 0.1.0, and once the docs and stuff are updated.\n. If you have time to update the Readme and demo that would help.\n. Closing as duplicate of #80 \n. Ah sorry about that, thanks.\nOn Wed, Aug 27, 2014 at 8:33 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nMerged #81.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/pull/81#event-157929215\n. Is there any way you could resubmit this without the extra commits. It looks like you ran build, it would help keep our history cleaner. Looks like we only need a57dce6\n. Thanks!\n. Good catch!\n. Unlike many simple 3rd party directives, Formly does include it's own templates for the form and form fields. Since you're changing the symbol, those break. Any 3rd party directive you use that has its own templates and uses {{}} is going to break. As Kent mentioned we have a build with no templates at all, use this to get around the issue. You can copy all our templates if needed, but otherwise the templates are provided for convenience.\n. Working on the transfer today to create a dedicated Organization\n. Sure, we'll do the transfer but hold off on releasing a new version till thats ready?\n. We're going to be in limbo for a bit till our registration is transferred. Thankfully the old bower install still seems to work.\n\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#issuecomment-57228439\n. thats cool with me\n. Regarding a nimbly page/package, I'll do that asap.\n. I checked and formly is already taken, any other ideas?\n. imho opinion the formly code is currently fairly language specific, it's light because we're not doing a whole lot of heavy lifting, just implementing some basic features of angular. For example angular specific directives that we wouldn't want to reimplement so they would all match in every library while cluttering up the angular version. I'd imagine that react doesn't have all the same features as angular and it would be quite a project to reach parody. I'm assuming the same can probably be said in the opposite direction.\nThat being said, it would be really cool to make progress on a specification which can be used by any flavor of formly or by others. I think the specification is the main component which would allow people to switch rendering libraries on the fly. Otherwise the code isn't that unique. Does anyone know if there is a json-form specification out there that I should have used already?\n. Jumping back on track here, how does formly-js sound? I think it's available...\n. ok, formly-js it is!\n. Alright we're live on bower using the same angular-formly but now pointing to the new org.\n. @quietlyconfident I originally built this app with the desire to use it to make a form building app alongside it. It would be really awesome to see that come to light.\nI'm sure that something similar could easily be built with this library or forked from theirs and adapted to our structure.\n. What version of Angular are you using?\n. This package might work with 1.3.0 but it is untested. Try the version specified in the bower dependencies or 1.2.23\n. We have 1.3.0 support in mind, but it probably wont be ready for a little while.\n. Please reopen if that doesn't fix it\n. Makes sense\n. Awesome, thanks\n. @kentcdodds are we skipping this for 1.0.0?\n. Sounds good\nOn Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 6:28 PM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@astrism, the entire build will need to change since we're splitting the templates out, so I'd say yes.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/110#issuecomment-57738052\n.

Can you put together a demo that shows what this would look like? I think you're suggesting that you want to group fields by type? I'm having trouble imagining how this would work in a real world scenario.\n. Hey @diegochavez can you please attempt to reproduce this in a plunker. We have a template here:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:1R3t4fvpXcJyiu96ICY5?p=preview\nMost likely it's not accessible because $rootScope methods aren't available to directives unless you inject $rootScope.\n. I believe you have 2 options to solve this.\nA) If the function can be different for every field, then pass it in as a property in formFields.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/giEUOrT5J16wuWcM68I3?p=preview\nB) Create a custom directive with it's own controller that can define this function or expose it to the template.\n. I see, those are currently required afaik:\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap/blob/master/src/fields/formly-field-select.html\n(See line 15)\n@kentcdodds Should we move these template-specific docs to the template repo? Seems they're a little out of date.\n. That being said, I'm fine merging this in, till then. What do you think @kentcdodds?\n. Updated the readme, ngmodules can't handle the youtube link or relative links but I fixed those. I also looked for a way to transfer/share ownership, doesn't seem to be one, but I think I can handle it for now. Alternatively I can delete the module so you can recreate it.\n. Also the repo/docs are looking great :clap: \n. I like that idea, if you have any specific suggestions on how to go about that let me know. I'll try and write something up soon. I'm thinking something along the lines of a string property in the field definition that allows you to specify a list of additional classes.\n. I like the idea of being able to specify a template, that would allow this directive to stay lean while being extensible with custom form elements.\n. @millette That sounds pretty cool to me. I think its a separate concept, here I'm discussing how to layout the fields displayed, and that would be more like branching sets of logic.\n. Thanks I'll check this out this week.\n. Looks good actually, thanks. I'll tag a release later this week though.\n. Looks good thanks\n. I'll add that soon, hopefully the demo site helps in the mean time. While they're a little complex, the two important files to look at for the demo site are these:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/blob/master/src/views/home.html\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/blob/master/src/views/home.js\nThe options set in the html are defined in the home controller.\n<formly-form result=\"formData\"\n             fields=\"formFields\"\n             options=\"formOptions\"\n             ng-submit=\"onSubmit()\">\n</formly-form>\n. The example has been expanded quite significantly, and documentation of each feature added. Let me know if you think we need more but I'm going to close for now.\n. This would take the submit button out of the form component which I'm not sure is a great choice. Any ideas on how you would handle this?\n. For the first question, you can add a $watch to the result object you pass in. Once it changes then you'll have your event trigger.\nFor the second question there is a hideSubmit option which you can pass to the formOptions\n. Thanks, I'll set aside some time tomorrow to check these out.\n. @t8g For both Radio and Select the idea is to only store the data necessary to recreate the values input into the form. For radio inputs the only important data is value which is what html(and the AngularJS component) use to display a radio input. For the Select the default AngularJS component uses a object or value inside of an array. \nFrom formly-field-select.html:\nng-options=\"option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\"\nFrom the AngularJS docs for select\n\nvalue: local variable which will refer to each item in the array or each property value of object during iteration.\n\nAngular uses the object as the value which is selected when you choose an option. In our case, since we're using their component, I'm using their structure. It looks like their component automatically generates values for each select item. However I don't know a way to get that value, nor use it to recreate the state of the form.\nhtml\n<select class=\"form-control ng-pristine ng-valid ng-valid-required\" id=\"formlyselect9\" ng-model=\"value\" ng-required=\"options.required\" ng-disabled=\"options.disabled\" ng-init=\"value = options.options[options.default]\" ng-options=\"option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\">\n    <option value=\"?\" selected=\"selected\"></option>\n    <optgroup label=\"inefficiently\">\n        <option value=\"0\">Car</option>\n        <option value=\"1\">Helicopter</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">Sport Utility Vehicle</option>\n    </optgroup>\n    <optgroup label=\"efficiently\">\n        <option value=\"3\">Bicycle</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">Skateboard</option>\n        <option value=\"5\">Walk</option>\n        <option value=\"6\">Bus</option>\n        <option value=\"7\">Scooter</option>\n        <option value=\"8\">Train</option>\n        <option value=\"9\">Hot Air Baloon</option>\n    </optgroup>\n</select>\nFor your second question thats now handled and pushed to 0.0.10\n. Good question, you use the index of the element in the list.\n. Looks good, thanks\n. Updated to 0.0.10\n. Looks good, thanks\n. Whats the jshint error?\n. ah I see, yeah I think it would be a good idea to change this.\n. @trunghaiy I tried to reproduce this issue but as far as I can tell newer versions of JSHint have es5 mode turned on by default.\n\nIf you're still seeing this error then you should update your version of JSHint. Since 2.0.0 the es5 option has been enabled by default...\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10936180/suppress-expected-an-identifier-and-instead-saw-default-a-reserved-word-in\n\nYou can read more about that here:\nhttp://jslinterrors.com/expected-an-identifier-and-instead-saw-a-a-reserved-word/\n. Let me know if you really need this to be es3 compatible, as far as I can tell you only need this if you're targeting IE6, which I don't think I'd like to worry about supporting if I can avoid it.\n. This looks great, do you mind updating the newly minted docs as well. Thanks!\n. Hey Kent, The first part of your pull request for hide looks great, but I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way to handle the watches. I'm seeing 6 calls to the watch method in its current implementation no matter what is changed on the scope. I believe its 2 calls per hideExpression, per scope change of any kind to the form scope, not just the results field. I don't think this would be a major bottle neck, but I spent a little time trying a few options to see if we could get it down.\nIn addition, the watcher code only runs when the form is instantiated so if you modify the form definition it won't rerun and the functionality is broken. Editing the form definition is an edge case, but I'd like to create some sort of form construction tool in the future using this library, so I see that being an issue as well.\nI tried this the code below, it just watched result, deeply, and if there are changes it loops through the fields to see if they have hide expressions. I don't think its the most elegant solution, but it does work around those two problems listed above. What do you think, I'm open for discussion! My only concern with my solution is looping through all the fields every time...\njavascript\n    //formly-form.js\n    ...\ncontroller: function($scope, $element) {\n            $scope.$watch('result', function(newValue) {\n                console.log('result changed');\n                angular.forEach($scope.fields, function(field, index) {\n                    if (field.hideExpression) {\n                        var getter = $parse(field.hideExpression);\n                        field.hide = getter($scope.result);\n                    }\n                });\n            }, true);\n        },\n    ...\n. I agree with @jhr007, but I think it would be cool to create a set of custom templates that are compatible with the library to enable inline editing. I'd like to keep the library bare bones and then allow you to swap dependencies based on the type of forms you need.\n. @kentcdodds thanks for putting that together, its all pushed up and a new version tagged at 0.0.10\n. Actually the only issue I just realized is we need to update the Readme with documentation on how to use the new feature. If you get a chance to look at that it would be helpful. Otherwise I'll try and get to it later this week.\nI haven't done too many pull requests as a repo owner myself, so I think we did ok :smile: \n. Nevermind, I think its all in the readme...\n. This is awesome, I'll try and get this in today.\n. Ok this is merged in, but I think i did it wrong so this PR didn't get registered as merged...\nAlso I moved the provider into its own file in a provider folder and with a more descriptive name so its clear when being injected.\n. 0.0.11 btw\n. Hmm, I did a little digging and it looks like its the default, which is why the minifier removes it... As you'll read, people sometimes rely on it to style or for js selectors. I think I'd agree that it should be there, even if it's not technically necessary. Anyone else have an opinion?\nIssue calling this out:\nhttps://github.com/kangax/html-minifier/issues/105\n. Fixed in 0.0.12\n. Yeah lets hold off with 1.2 ngMessages for now. We can start on a new branch with 1.3 support if someone would like to take a crack at it.\n. Sorry about the styleguide stuff, I've elaborated in #100 \n. Ha, awesome, thanks!\n. Seems like this would work for number and/or email templates, I've never used it before?\nI think this would be a good inclusion either way, can you update the readme and changelog. I can run the build command once we're ready to tag a new release.\n. @inalgnu once you have this ready please change the target branch for this PR to 0.0.12 so I can easily merge this in. Thanks!\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository\n. Looking forward to getting this in but I'm closing this PR so that you can resubmit.\nBefore resubmitting please submit to branch 0.0.12 and add documentation for the new feature. Thanks!\n. Sounds good\n. This will be in 0.0.12\n. Closed with #39 \n. Hey Kent, I won't be able to get to this till Wed. You might be able to just create a new branch from the current formly master. Unless it builds on this one...\n. I'm seeing an error when I test this:\n- Check the joe checkbox\n- start typing in the This is a special form field text area\n- error: TypeError: Cannot set property 'field' of undefined\n. Looks good I'm ready to merge this but can you change the target branch from master to my new 0.0.12 branch.\nI can't do it but I think this describes how you can do it:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository\n. Closed via #39 \n. Agreed, ok\n. Yeah we have no issues with that, I've never used browserify but I know it's popular. Feel free to submit a PR and we'll drop it in.\n. Fair enough, I'll look into it soon.\n. Its published here: https://www.npmjs.org/package/angular-formly\nThis is my first node package so let me know if there are any problems.\n. <input type=\"date\"> is unsupported by most browsers at the moment and this library is focused on only using the native and/or vanilla angular components. You can definitely use one of the existing libraries like ui-bootstrap to achieve this with a custom form template.\nUI-Bootstrap date picker\nhttp://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/datepicker\nSupport for HTML5 date\nhttp://caniuse.com/input-datetime\nhttp://www.wufoo.com/html5/types/4-date.html\n. I haven't read through this very thoroughly yet but uniqueFormId should be present in the form options. Can you try this and see if adding helps resolve any conflicts?\n. @scull7 were you able to figure anything out yet? there is no safe variable in our code so I'm not 100% sure this is from our library.\nAlso, this looks like minified code, is the issue happening in your unminified code? It would be great to get a stack trace that had the actual file names in it.\n. Ok, going to close this for now...\n. @testuserx I agree that it would be nice to have this functionality. I've proposed it here: https://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/1\nThat being said, I don't really have any good solutions for it. For now this project is best for simple layouts only.\n. I like the idea of using ng-if as an alternative to ng-hide. Is there any reason to keep ng-hide?\nIn a future release I'd to move the template back into html, we can achieve the same string replacement effect, if we still need to, by loading via the template cache. We're doing this in formly-field currently. I don't like editing html in strings like this, it's just hard to read and work with imho. I don't mind making this change myself as I'm being the picky one here :)\nThis also breaks our ability to customize formly-form.html across builds, not that we were, but I'd like to leave that option open.\nI'm going to release it as-is in 0.0.15\n. Sounds good, those can be two separate initiatives. I think I have a good idea on how to separate the html. I'll tackle that in a future release.\n. I just mean for layout purposes, nothing to do with the way its implemented.\n. I see what you mean, but I don't think it needs to be customizable. Just in that column so that its clear its a configuration.\n. Lame, well this works for me thanks!\n. It seems like this might be a step in the direction of ditching the value property. Can we just use result.value going forward?\n. ha, good point. I'll create a new issue for that, but I think this is the right direction to move. Unless we have a good reason to keep it around I think it can go in a future release.\n. Agreed those are both solid options. Closing for now\n. Closing for now, please reopen if you continue seeing this issue.\n. Not positive but I think the fix you're looking for is resolved by #44. You can set the default value in options using the name of the option you pass in.\n. That would be awesome, the templates would be pretty easy to rewrite but I've never used Ionic myself.\n. @cfreyre I just added support in 0.0.14 for additional base templates. There is a little bit of build process customization but I can help with that if you need. Let me know if you plan on working on this. I'm going to reopen this task as I'd like to see it done either way.\n. Sure sounds like a good addition to me, the bootstrap templates are in their own folder. Please add it to the readme as well.\u00a0Let me know of you have any questions!\nOn Tue, Jul 29, 2014 at 3:48 AM, Jon Espen Kvisler\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHey, great project!\nWould have been cool if I could add help text to each field also (including radio/checkbox options), using e.g. .help-block (from bootstrap anyway). \nWhat do you think? I can probably have a go at it and submit a PR.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/52\n. Sounds good, I think that would be pretty easy to exclude add to the build process. I do like having the premise templates so that in many cases people can just drop things in and get started but I trust there are plenty of users who just want custom stuff. I'm happy to support both cases, though I think the default should be plain templates.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 29, 2014 at 8:49 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI think it would be good to actually separate things so much that this project had several builds with and without templates. On most of my projects I override the template types anyway, so I'd prefer to not have the templates in my code. I think this would be a good thing in general, just to separate things out a bit. We should also add a wiki article for how to create a custom template and show how easy it is. I think that would decrease the number of issues asking for changes to templates where a custom template would be better...\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/53\n. I actually already did a large amount of that work last release. There was a breaking change which defaulted the templates to plain. I don't use the same -tpls naming convention unfortunately, just .bootstrap I believe. -no-tpls sounds good to me.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 29, 2014 at 9:20 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nSeems reasonable. I'd say we'd want to have another output file that ended in no-tpls, what do you think?\nEventually, there could be a use case to support templates for more than just bootstrap. We could do style-it-yourself templates where we add some classes to allow customizability, and we could have pure.css templates, and I'm sure there are more. But if we separated these out into their own folders, it would encourage the community to contribute templates for their favorite css libraries. Each of these libraries could have its own build. To do that right, I think that we'd have a breaking change to default to the no templates output and then a {library}-tpls file for each template type. What do you think?\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/53#issuecomment-50500100\n. This looks awesome @jonespen, I'll make sure it's in the next release, 0.0.15.\n. Reopened as https://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/pull/56 in the 0.0.15 branch\n. One way to add this could be with a directive that feeds the typeahead data. You could use either formlyTemplateProvider or just override a single field with a template that uses the typeahead/http directive. Would that work in your case?\n. sorry been pretty busy this week. I'll look over this with you guys by Wed I believe\n. Sounds like this would be a separate build of formly dedicated to AngularStrap, at the very least. However since the functionality requested is above and beyond the base functionality of AngularStrap I'm not sure that it belongs anywhere other than a custom form field. Something that is tailored to your project, of course it could always be based on an AngularStrap/Formly build, but as @kentcdodds mentioned it would require custom templates across all fields, which wouldn't even be part of the AngularStrap build. I would see a AngularStrap build focusing on implementing their form related components, Timepicker, Datepicker, Select, and maybe typeahead. Anything beyond that wouldn't make a lot of sense in my opinion.\n. It just seems like excess to me, it certainly isn't an urgent issue but it feels like an extra moving/breakable part that could easily be simplified with direct access to the result or a getter.\n. Ha, absolutely agree. My lack of test writing experience is the major reason we don't have that yet, maybe it's time to learn..\n. You're more than welcome to do so. Let me know if you do get started or want some help writing tests.\n. I'm working on 0.0.15 right now, so today, just going to go through and test everything as thoroughly as i can here. What kind of stuff are you moving?\n. Ok, all yours. 0.0.16 (I messed up 15) is live!\n. Thanks, I'm taking a look as well. I'll let you know if figure anything out.\n. looks like it should go from:\n\nng-options=\"option.value as option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\"\nto\nng-options=\"option.name as option.name group by option.group for option in options.options\"\nDoes that work for you?\n. ha, no worries\nThe first value, select, if set, is the value thats bound. So option.value wasn't a real thing, and wasn't getting bound.\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/select\n\nselect: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent  element. If not specified, select expression will default to value.\n. Yeah #61 broke it, how did that get past our rigorous test suite! Easy fix at least :)\n. I can push this fix up\n. I could get behind that change\n. Looks like a good setup to me, how do I configure the symlinks, they don't seem to work out-of-the-box? I get 404's for all of the bower_components.\n. Can we change the ignore to the new location? src/bower-components\n\nOn Thu, Aug 21, 2014 at 3:58 PM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWhoops, because the symlink was called bower_components it was ignored via the .gitignore. I think I'm going to remove that from the git ignore. Another option would be to name the symlink different, but then it's a little confusing. Want to use the symlink so we can symlink the bower_components in the test directory as well...\nAnyway, what do you think about removing bower_components from the .gitignore?\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/pull/72#issuecomment-52996469\n. I'm confused, in this PR they are still located in src, are you saying you want to move them out of there? If we were to just leave them there, and change .gitignore from bower_components to src/bower_components it would allow the symlink to be wherever, assuming you had it at the top level?\n. Ok sounds good\n. Awesome, I'll take a look\n. looks great, merged\n. Ok, I\u2019ll jump on that shortly\n\nOn Fri, Aug 22, 2014 at 1:25 PM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@astrism looks like you have to setup travis-ci on this because I don't have admin access: https://travis-ci.org/profile/nimbly\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/issues/73#issuecomment-53115848\n. Ok I enabled Travis CI.\n. Added\n. It's running now actually: https://travis-ci.org/nimbly/angular-formly/builds/33324189\n. Maybe global install? http://badsyntax.co/post/travis-ci-and-bower\n. Yeah i can do that\n. We're officially Passing!\n. I recently setup a custom text field and set the max length using the native maxlength attribute. For some reason ng-maxlength wasn't working for me at all.\nmaxlength=\"{{options.maxlength}}\"\nI think this would be a good addition to the templates.\n. Agreed, I never intended for this library to go too far above native Angular support for forms. For that kind of support I like the idea individual library plugins, i.e. UI-Bootstrap or Angular-Strap for their more enhanced UI components. It is my opinion that the base Formly should be UI agnostic if possible.\n. Yep, moving this discussion over there :)\n. I think we'd just be creating several repos which depend on this one. It would be good for this one to mention the others and maybe the demo would use the bootstrap one. The real question is should we do this in 0.1.0 or move it to a future release? I'm going to be out for a couple weeks traveling soon, hopefully none of this requires my urgent help, but I'll try and jump in when I can. @kentcdodds do you have any desire to own those repos, or we could even create a new org i suppose? This is turning out to be quite the project :)\n. Yeah I think I might do that, it'll make it easier to manage contributors and stuff.\n. Hey all, this is finally in progress! Currently the templates are pointing to the latest hash for angular-formly. The template repos as I have them are dependent on angular-formly, unlike the current standalone builds. I think that this structure allows for us to release extended templates like an angular-bootstrap template that can live side by side with the base template. I think this is a great setup, the only part I don't like is having to generate this file each time:\n\nangular.module('formly.render').config(function(formlyConfigProvider) {\n    'use strict';\n    var fields = [\n        'textarea', 'radio', 'select', 'number', 'checkbox',\n        'password', 'hidden', 'email', 'text'\n    ];\n    angular.forEach(fields, function(field) {\n        formlyConfigProvider.setTemplateUrl(field, 'fields/formly-field-' + field + '.html');\n    });\n});\nI feel like there might be a less verbose way of doing this, but I haven't thought of anything yet.\nNext I'll be removing templates from angular-formly, release angular-formly, then update the template repos and release them.\nHere are the repos:\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-vanilla\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap\n. @kentcdodds sounds good. I'm going to leave it for now.\nTemplates are now removed from angular-formly. Final remaining thing is updating the docs in angular-formly to mention the other repos. I won't get to it today so if anyone else has time feel free.\n. All done and released\n. The current structure defined in the docs for defining options is: \n{\n  \"name\": \"Walk\",\n  \"group\": \"low emissions\"\n}\nWhat you're suggesting wouldn't work with this setup and breaks our current demo page. Are you proposing we change this? I could use a little info as to why and a maybe update the pull request with the full change. I should be able to look at this in more detail on Wed, but thats why I made that change initially, and it worked well for the demo as well as being backwards compatible.\n. Just reread #60 and I see you want both name and value there, I think this makes sense. It's probably ok to break the backwards compatibility, but we'll need to update the docs and demo.\n{\n  \"name\": \"Yes, and I love it!\",\n  \"value\": \"yesyes\",\n  \"group\": \"positive vibes\"\n}\n. That works for me, we'll get this update in to 0.1.0, and once the docs and stuff are updated.\n. If you have time to update the Readme and demo that would help.\n. Closing as duplicate of #80 \n. Ah sorry about that, thanks.\nOn Wed, Aug 27, 2014 at 8:33 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nMerged #81.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly/pull/81#event-157929215\n. Is there any way you could resubmit this without the extra commits. It looks like you ran build, it would help keep our history cleaner. Looks like we only need a57dce6\n. Thanks!\n. Good catch!\n. Unlike many simple 3rd party directives, Formly does include it's own templates for the form and form fields. Since you're changing the symbol, those break. Any 3rd party directive you use that has its own templates and uses {{}} is going to break. As Kent mentioned we have a build with no templates at all, use this to get around the issue. You can copy all our templates if needed, but otherwise the templates are provided for convenience.\n. Working on the transfer today to create a dedicated Organization\n. Sure, we'll do the transfer but hold off on releasing a new version till thats ready?\n. We're going to be in limbo for a bit till our registration is transferred. Thankfully the old bower install still seems to work.\n\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#issuecomment-57228439\n. thats cool with me\n. Regarding a nimbly page/package, I'll do that asap.\n. I checked and formly is already taken, any other ideas?\n. imho opinion the formly code is currently fairly language specific, it's light because we're not doing a whole lot of heavy lifting, just implementing some basic features of angular. For example angular specific directives that we wouldn't want to reimplement so they would all match in every library while cluttering up the angular version. I'd imagine that react doesn't have all the same features as angular and it would be quite a project to reach parody. I'm assuming the same can probably be said in the opposite direction.\nThat being said, it would be really cool to make progress on a specification which can be used by any flavor of formly or by others. I think the specification is the main component which would allow people to switch rendering libraries on the fly. Otherwise the code isn't that unique. Does anyone know if there is a json-form specification out there that I should have used already?\n. Jumping back on track here, how does formly-js sound? I think it's available...\n. ok, formly-js it is!\n. Alright we're live on bower using the same angular-formly but now pointing to the new org.\n. @quietlyconfident I originally built this app with the desire to use it to make a form building app alongside it. It would be really awesome to see that come to light.\nI'm sure that something similar could easily be built with this library or forked from theirs and adapted to our structure.\n.

Sorry about that, the link was incorrect. We're in the middle of a org transition. It should be fixed now.\n\nhttp://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/#!/\n. Can you put together a demo that shows what this would look like? I think you're suggesting that you want to group fields by type? I'm having trouble imagining how this would work in a real world scenario.\n. Hey @diegochavez can you please attempt to reproduce this in a plunker. We have a template here:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:1R3t4fvpXcJyiu96ICY5?p=preview\nMost likely it's not accessible because $rootScope methods aren't available to directives unless you inject $rootScope.\n. I believe you have 2 options to solve this.\nA) If the function can be different for every field, then pass it in as a property in formFields.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/giEUOrT5J16wuWcM68I3?p=preview\nB) Create a custom directive with it's own controller that can define this function or expose it to the template.\n. I see, those are currently required afaik:\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap/blob/master/src/fields/formly-field-select.html\n(See line 15)\n@kentcdodds Should we move these template-specific docs to the template repo? Seems they're a little out of date.\n. That being said, I'm fine merging this in, till then. What do you think @kentcdodds?\n. Updated the readme, ngmodules can't handle the youtube link or relative links but I fixed those. I also looked for a way to transfer/share ownership, doesn't seem to be one, but I think I can handle it for now. Alternatively I can delete the module so you can recreate it.\n. Also the repo/docs are looking great :clap: \n. ",

    "kentcdodds": "I have developed a work around for my own project that does this. The basic idea is that you make directives out of all of your templates. Then you have another template that simply uses those directives and has something like this for it's options:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'grouped-field',\n  data: {\n    fields: [\n      {\n        type: 'text',\n        label: 'First Name'\n      },\n      {\n        type: 'text',\n        label: 'Last Name'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\nThen, in the template for grouped-field you simply use the directives for the type you pass in and pass the options specified in data.fields Does that make sense?\n. I use a directive for double input:\naz-double-input.js\n``` javascript\n(function() {\n  'use strict';\nangular.module('atac.common').directive('azDoubleInput', azDoubleInput);\nfunction azDoubleInput(COMMON_DIRECTIVES) {\n    return {\n      restrict: 'E',\n      templateUrl: COMMON_DIRECTIVES + 'component/az-double-input.html',\n      scope: {\n        options: '=',\n        formId: '=',\n        index: '=',\n        result: '=',\n        form: '='\n      }\n    };\n  }\n})();\n```\naz-double-input.html\nhtml\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <az-formly-label></az-formly-label>\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\" style=\"padding:0 7px 0 0\">\n    <az-formly-input options=\"options.data.leftField\" result=\"result\" index=\"index\" form-id=\"formId\" form=\"form\"></az-formly-input>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\" style=\"padding:0 0 0 7px\">\n    <az-formly-input options=\"options.data.rightField\" result=\"result\" index=\"index\" form-id=\"formId\" form=\"form\"></az-formly-input>\n  </div>\n</div>\nWhere az-formly-input is the label-less directive version of my formly input template\nThe config uses template instead of type so I can use the directive (could easily turn this into a formly template via setTemplate(...))\njavascript\n{\n  template: [\n    '<az-double-input options=\"options\" form-id=\"formId\" index=\"index\" result=\"result\" form=\"form\">',\n    '</az-double-input>'\n  ].join('')\n  data: {\n    leftField: {\n      key: 'firstName',\n      placeholder: 'First Name',\n      required: true\n    },\n    rightField: {\n      key: 'firstName',\n      placeholder: 'First Name',\n      required: true\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote, some of the stuff you see in there (like form) are part of an abstraction I've added on top of formly that make my life easier.

If you think it's unresolved, please feel free to open it again and we can talk about what we're lacking.\n. In 0.1.0, we've removed the submit button from the form template entirely. This will not be supported.\n. How difficult would it be to add a template field as well? So it doesn't have to be in a whole other file?\n. I'm looking into it and I'm not sure of the best approach to take.\n~~I'm thinking that it would be best to add an ng-hide=\"field.hide\" to the <formly-field ng-repeat... in the formly-form template. Then, in the formly-form controller, when initializing the scope, iterate through the fields and add a hide property and add a watcher to the scope for each of the hide expressions. When that watch listener fires, set the field.hide property to the value of the expression.~~\n~~The trouble I'm having now is: How do we get the scope to evaluate the expression on (watch the expression). I've thought about adding it as another property to the formField but passing scopes around just feels wrong.~~\nJust came up with a much better simpler implementation.

Alright my changes are in, complete with updated README, bower version, CHANGELOG, and demo. Thanks!\n\nPerhaps eventually we could make it as simple as what I wanted to do (as illustrated by #16)...\n. I just found a better solution. Let me make another pull request and we can talk about it. It actually enables both options so I'll probably just include it in this PR. Give me just a second...\n. @astrism, let me know if you have any questions. But this seems to work quite nicely\n. Just throwing this out there... Would it be more performant if we put an ng-change on the formly-field directive? This way the watch listener is only executed when a change occurred and the watch expression is not evaluated.\nEither way, I don't see a way of getting around a dynamic form definition without doing things this way. And I imagine if this goes the direction you're wanting it to, you're going to have to loop through each field every time the result changes anyway. I think the solution you have above would work well... Let me know if you want me to change my pull request to reflect this.\n. @astrism, I would really love it if we could figure out what needs to happen for this to get merged today. I have another PR I'm creating in a little bit that I would like in, but I don't want to update the changelog for it because we'd have a merge conflict with this PR.

I just remembered I didn't run grunt build because I didn't want to have merge conflicts :-) asap on these though please :-) Thanks!\n. Whoops. Accidentally closed this.\nI rebased master. Not sure if that's how I should have done this, may have been better to merge it. Anyway, if I need to recreate this whole pull request that's fine, let me know what I need to do to get this into the main repo and get the 0.0.10 tag on after this is merged in. Thanks!\n. Thanks @astrism :-)\nWould love some feedback from you. I've done a few PRs in the past, but I'd love to know if there's anything I can do to make this process easier for repo owners. Any feedback for me?\n. :+1: \n. :+1:\n. There are a few ways that you could implement it. You wouldn't be able to use any of the built in types. But you could add your own type with the formlyTemplateProvider's setTemplateUrl function.\nHow I have implemented this kind of thing though is using the template property. You create your own directive with the template of that directive being what you want the field to be. It has access to the options and value properties used in the other templates. And then in the directive's link function you can add functionality (like auto-complete). For example:\n``` javascript\nvar formFields = {\n  key: 'something',\n  template: ''\n};\napp.directive('someAwesomeDirective', function() {\n  return {\n    template: ' formly templatey stuff ',\n    link: function(scope, el, attrs) {\n      scope.functionality = function() {\n        // do something awesome\n      }\n    }\n  };\n});\n``\n. I agree that gettingngMessagesin would be cool. But I would be wary about including it because it's only supported in angular 1.3-beta right now (if I'm not mistaken). If support is added, it would probably be good to make it optional...\n. Thanks for the work on it. However I think that you're doing a lot of work unnecessarily. You have access to the$errorproperty of the form fields viaoptions.formField.$error` in the template. Also, we want to make sure this is an opt-in thing because many people wont have the luxury of being on angular 1.3, so we need to make sure that it can work without the messages on the page.\nAnd one other thing, please make sure that your whitespace is following our project standard. Please use tabs (I know, I hate tabs too, but we need consistency). Thanks again for taking a stab at this!\n. Looks like you're doing that bit alright, but @astrism also asks that we tab and then space forward on continuation lines. It's @astrism's styleguide, I can't remember when I saw him specify that, but the rest of our project looks like it. If you want a sample, see this line.\n. Try this:\njavascript\nangular.element(document.getElementById('formlytext0')).scope().options.formField\nIt works for me on the demo.\n. Really? Huh... Interested to see your PR! Thanks!\n. @abodacs, we haven't done any work to integrate the ngMessages module into formly core. But with where we are now, I don't believe it would make sense for it to go into the core project. It would make more sense for it to go into the template modules.\nI think that we're hoping to create a css framework agnostic module that would be for common template utilities and components. Integration with ngMessages would likely fit in well with something like that.\n. This is definitely a template-specific item. If you want support for ngMessages you'll need to implement templates that make use of them (using the options.formControl that formly adds to your template's scope) or submit a PR to the template library that you're using.\n. I'm interested in this as well...\n. +1, I don't have a use case because all of my stuff is custom templates, but I can definitely see people wanting this if they're using Bootstrap.\n. Where do you think this would be best implemented? Should there be another provider called formlyConfigProvider and have two providers to configure formly (formlyTemplateProvider as well)? Or should we combine these config options into a single formlyConfigProvider?\nI'm sad that the decision was made to create the formlyTemplateProvider instead of having it be more generically formlyProvider. Because now if we want to combine them, it's a breaking change... I'm probably the only one using the formlyTemplateProvider at this point though so that's probably fine... I'd like to hear your thoughts. I plan on implementing this today...\n. I'm implementing this now with a formlyOptionsProvider. It doesn't seem too bad...\n. @astrism, this is now closed, but you need to run the build to get the dist folder up to date...\n. Note: I didn't grunt build, so you'll have to do that yourself before you tag (if you tag at this commit)\n. As I was using this in my project, I noticed that if I didn't provide options, angular got angry at me, but now that I can configure all formly forms to have the options I want I no longer need the options attribute.\n. @astrism any word on this? I have another PR I'm getting ready to do and I want to be able to use master on my fork to do it...\n. Now that I think about it, it doesn't have anything to do with this one, I may submit it before. Thanks.\n. Fixed @astrism. Thanks!\n. +1 to this. Perhaps I'll create a PR (If you don't first @delaman ;D)\n. @astrism, I would recommend closing this issue. It's solved with the template property. Though we could enhance the formlyTemplateProvider to have a setTemplate as well as a setTemplateUrl...\n. I've never used browserify, but I'm a node user and I'm curious how to make the library any more \"node friendly\" when everything is just inside an angular call (other than getting it registered in npm). Can't you simply: require('angular-formly') and the code would run? We don't have to have a module.exports if we're not exporting anything right?\n. Awesome. Well, I think this is one thing that we'll have to leave to the nimbly folks... It's their repo after all... @astrism? :+1: \n. @astrism, I think this is something you'll want to do yourself. You'll want to create the package.json the way you want (authors/desc/etc.) and then you'll want to be the one to publish it so you can be the one to republish it...\n. I think you'd want to just make your own templates for that. I don't think\nit is part of the mission of this library to cover every edge case. Just to\nmake those cases possible...\n- Kent C.

With the current implementation this could be difficult. I think the simplest way to do this would be to change the formly-form template from an html file to a string returned by the template function in the formly-form directive. This would allow conditionally setting the attribute ng-hide or ng-if. I think this would be reasonable.\n. @astrism, I like all of the things you said. I'm not certain whether removing ng-hide would cause adverse impacts on people or not... But it seems to work fine in the demo.\n\nI also think we should keep it in an html file. But I don't know how to configure a specific form to have one directive (ng-if) and another to have another (ng-hide) without having two templates that are almost exact duplicates... I'd definitely get behind this effort.\n. What will have to happen for this is we'll have to store the configured default options in local storage like we do the custom templates thing if we want it to be customizable....\n. This would be a breaking change because anyone who uses a custom template would have to update their template's ng-model (for example).\n. Hmmm... Looking at it now I'm not certain of the best way to go about it. I'm thinking that it would be a diversion from how things currently work a little bit. Right now we just have a result object with all the values hanging off of it. If we were to do a valueHolder then we'd have to keep the result.value and the valueHolder.value in sync.\nOne thing that we could do that may not be a bad way to go about it would be to pass the result itself into the field directive. That may actually be extremely valuable and would be extremely simply to do... I may look into doing that. I'll submit a PR @astrism...\n. Not result.value but result[options.key] would work.\n. Moved this comment to #68 \n. I don't understand your question....\n. You could always $watch properties on the result object.\nHowever, I would recommend making your own template called password-match or something that would have two fields in it and set value to the password's value when they match. This way you can have more control over validation etc. Feel free to check out how I do field matching validation: http://kent.doddsfamily.us/kcd-angular/#/kcd-input-match (copied below)\nkcd-input-match directive\nDocs\nUseful for password and password confirmation input fields. Use like so:\nhtml\n<input ng-model=\"password\" type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Your password\">\n<input pk-input-match=\"{{password}}\" ng-model=\"password2\" type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Your password again (just in case)\">\nThis will set the field's $error.match property to whether it matches the given value or not.\nCode\njavascript\nangular.module('kcd.directives').directive('kcdInputMatch', function() {\n  'use strict';\n  return {\n    require: 'ngModel',\n    restrict: 'A',\n    link: function(scope, elem, attrs, ctrl) {\n      scope.$watch(function() {\n        return attrs.kcdInputMatch === ctrl.$modelValue;\n      }, function(currentValue) {\n        ctrl.$setValidity('match', currentValue);\n      });\n    }\n  };\n});\n. I can't think of a way to make the built in templates generic enough to account for all the different ways to do i18n. I think if you rely on the template to do your i18n for you (through a filter for example) then you'll have to make your own templates. You can easily override the built in templates using the formlyTemplateProvider. See the readme.\nNote, another (more performant) option is to use the $filter service to generate your i18n strings and pass the label and placeholder through that when initializing the formly form. You wouldn't need to change the built in templates with this option.\n. It's available on the 0.0.12 branch. It's not yet released and the documentation for it should probably be in the 0.0.12 branch... You can point to the most recent commit.\n. @ilyagelman, is this working for you now?\n. :+1: that would be convenient. Would be a pretty simple PR if you want to try to take a whack at it. Just edit this file: src/directives/formly-field-select.html and make sure to follow the development instructions.\n. @inalgnu, where did you get on this?\n. Closing as it doesn't have anything to do with formly core anymore and I personally would just use validators for this anyway :-)\n. I can think of a way to get around this limitation, but I think a more appropriate solution would require a PR.\nWhat I'm thinking is in the formly-field.js we add a scope variable called formResult and in formly-form.html we pass the result object in as an argument. This way, all templates would have access to the whole form via the formResult variable on the scope. This would give field templates a lot more power.\nWhat do you think @astrism?\n. @gizmoboy this will be possible with #62. I was waiting on @astrism to review it, but I guess that's why he gave me commit privileges. I'll merge it now... merged... but it's still @astrism's responsibility to rebuild the project and publish it to npm and bower. However, you ought to be able to test it out by pointing to this commit and using the non-built version of the js files. I'll leave this open until @astrism has a chance to rebuild and publish.\n. For some reason I am unable to claim the bounty on the website. Do you need to do something on your end?\n. I have merged this and run the build. Once it's published you can use a version, but until then you can point to this commit and it should work just fine for you.\n. If I understand your use case correctly, then this is possible if you use the result object in your template. I'll have to play around with it, but we may need to update all templates to bind to the result rather than simply the value. That would be another issue altogether. I'll look into it and let you know...\n. Looking at your question again, I think I misunderstood the use case. Could you give me an example of what you're actually trying to accomplish?\nI updated the demo to use the results of one field in the template of another. You can see how this looks on the demo. Enter anything into the \"first name\" field and see how that is bound to the custom template field below. But, again, I don't think this is what you were going for...\n. So this is something that I did on a personal project. I used the same form for creating a post (for example) as I did for editing one. It's quite simple. Instead of using default you simply set the result object that you pass into fromly to have the values of your model. The default only takes effect when the result has no value. So, you probably have something like this:\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"formData\" fields=\"formFields\" options=\"formOptions\" ng-submit=\"onSubmit()\"></formly-form>\njavascript\n$scope.formData = {};\n$scope.formFields = [\n  {\n    key: 'firstName',\n    default: 'Kent C.',\n    type: 'text'\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'lastName',\n    default: 'Dodds',\n    type: 'text'\n  }\n];\nInstead, what you want to do is:\njavascript\n$scope.formData = {\n  firstName: 'Kent C.',\n  lastName: 'Dodds'\n};\n$scope.formFields = [\n  {\n    key: 'firstName',\n    type: 'text'\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'lastName',\n    type: 'text'\n  }\n];\nSo, instead of using the default, set the value of the result you pass in. Does that help?\n. Hmmm... On the top of my head I thought that would do it... Do they not? We may need to have a directive for selects to manage initial values like this then... I've been considering making a place for directive templates like this for use cases like this as well as the button group.\n. Why don't you create a new issue as this is different and this issue is closed. This will take a little work, but I'm pretty sure I know how I would implement it.\n. Why don't you create the issue, put $50 on it, then I'll look into it and suggest more if I feel like it'll take more time...\n. Duplicated here #121 \n. The repo exists. Just need to create the templates, build, and release. Moving discussion to the repo\n. Seems reasonable. I'd say we'd want to have another output file that ended in no-tpls, what do you think?\nEventually, there could be a use case to support templates for more than just bootstrap. We could do style-it-yourself templates where we add some classes to allow customizability, and we could have pure.css templates, and I'm sure there are more. But if we separated these out into their own folders, it would encourage the community to contribute templates for their favorite css libraries. Each of these libraries could have its own build. To do that right, I think that we'd have a breaking change to default to the no templates output and then a {library}-tpls file for each template type. What do you think?\n. Oh, that's interesting. Must have missed seeing that release. Cool. I like that even better actually. have formly.js include the templates, then have a formly.none.js, a formly.bootstrap.js, formly.pure.js, etc. etc.\n. Fixed with b962dd26a68c70c8e9d51f1f9a995d84b405e02e\n. Wow, this is awesome a11y for the win! I noticed that the formatting of some of the files is a little off. Could you fix that before it's merged in? Thanks for doing this!\n. Looks perfect. Thanks again for doing this @jonespen. Hopefully someone will merge this soon (I'm just a community contributor, so I can't merge it myself).\n. Could you give more details? What do you do that causes this error?\n.

I think I have a solution, but I can't seem to reproduce the problem. But judging from the error message you're getting, I'd say that the issue is somehow a field has a watch object with no listener object. We should check that both an expression and listener are present on the watch object before creating the watch. I should have a fix soon, but I'm not certain how this issue is even happening...\n. Sorry, been off the planet for a day. @Rechtsproducten, what you did is how formly is designed to work actually. If you need functionality for your template beyond basic angular template stuff, then you simply create a directive. I actually generally will just us the template property for the formly config, but creating its own type works perfectly well also. Glad you got it working. If you like, I would love it if you could add a wiki article with how you solved the problem. That could help people in the future. Thanks a ton!\n. Interesting... If I go to the demo, it looks like radios are actually working as you expect it should, but the select is not...\n\n\n. Looks good to me. Thanks for doing this! @astrism will be in charge of updating the bower/npm packages.\n. Of course. I was worried about this when we broke out the templates, but I don't think there's really anything we can do about that... Thanks!\n. @gizmoboy, I've actually implemented a few of these custom templates for my own projects so I might be able to help with some of this. Some of these would definitely make sense in the library itself. Here's what I would recommend:\nCreate an issue for every feature you want in the library (non-proprietary stuff). Then use https://www.bountysource.com/ to place a bounty on the issue. Then anyone in the community can take it up if they want to piecemeal and I imagine you'll get most of the things you want pretty quickly.\nWhat do you think?\n. How important is the actual implementation you've described. Because what you've described may not necessarily be the exact best solution for what you're trying to accomplish based on what the library can do currently. Here's what I expect you need (implementation details aside):\n- A way to have a button bar with an option of single and multi-select\n- The value to indicate selection\nIs there more than this that you actually need?\nHere's my expected implementation:\nI'll definitely need to create a directive to handle this. Unfortunately a simple template wont be able to handle this well. Here's the interface for a buttonbar.\njavascript\n{\n    \"key\": \"triedEmber\",\n    \"type\": \"buttonbar\",\n    \"selectStyle\": \"SEE_BELOW\",\n    \"label\": \"Have you tried EmberJs yet?\",\n    \"default\": \"SEE_BELOW\",\n    \"options\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Yes, and I love it!\",\n            \"value\": \"yesyes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Yes, but I'm not a fan...\",\n            \"value\": \"yesno\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Nope\",\n            \"value\": \"no\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nThe selectStyle could be either 'single' or 'multiple'. This would determine what would be set as the value: a boolean for multiple with one options, an object for multiple with more than one option (where the keys are the property names and the value is true/false), and a single value for a single (which would be the value property of the option selected).\nThe default would simply be the initial value and the directive would handle converting that into what the view needs. If the result object provided already has a value, this default will be ignored.\nI think what I've described (including the implementation) is actually pretty well what you described, though we're not going to bring in a dependency on AngularStrap (partially because I'm not a fan of that particular library, and partially because I want to keep our dependencies down). Let me know if this isn't what you're looking for asap because I think I'm going to start working on this now...\n. Actually, I'm going to denote the type as 'buttongroup' as this is what bootstrap calls it.\n. @gizmoboy, as this is going to take a little more time than expected and I don't have a use case for it myself, I've upped the bounty to where I think I would personally be sufficiently motivated to add this feature. Let me know if that works for you and I'll get into implementing it.\n. This has been added. You can see it in the demo in the form of a checkbox above the email field: http://nimbly.github.io/angular-formly\n. Would really like to seek out @astrism's guidance on this one. This is not possible without using some javascript whether it be bootstrap, Angular-UI Bootstrap, or AngularStrap.\nPersonally, I'd say we'd want to do a pure bootstrap implementation so we don't tie people down to angular-ui bootstrap or AngularStrap. However, in all of my personal projects, I don't even include bootstrap's javascript, I just use Angular-UI Bootstrap...\nAnother solution would be to implement it with both Angular-UI Bootstrap and AngularStrap and allow it to be configurable. Unfortunately, the directives for each library are slightly different so we'd have to have an additional template for each small variation... Though we could always try for either an ng-include or a directive for each template where the template property is a function that returns a configured template (between the two I like the later option)...\nLet me know what you think @astrism, but either way, without a use case of my own for this, and with the effort it would take to implement (however that's done) I don't think I'd have the time to do it at the current bounty...\n. I'm not certain that it's necessary to remove value entirely. I would recommend that people use the 'result[options.key]' for custom templates just to avoid isolateScope issues, but the templates we have currently work just fine using the value property. Is there a problem I'm unaware of? No reason to change it if it's working fine and logically...\n. :+1: \n. Everything that I've committed is good to go. I haven't noticed anything wrong with the demo. I think we're good to go. One thing I would say we should add to this project is a full test suite... That would be a bit of an effort. But it should be done.\n. I'd be happy to scaffold our test suite. I don't think that I have the time or use case to justify working on this effort a lot, but I could get us off the ground.\n. Hey @astrism, I'm planning on moving things around a little bit. I think it'll be really good. But I don't want to have merge conflicts. Are you planning on making any changes? I'd rather wait until after 0.0.15 and work off of that release to move all this stuff. When is that going to happen?\n. I'm going to create a test directory with a symbiotic link to src. I'm going move all the demo related stuff to a demo folder with a symbiotic to src. Annnnd... Yeah, that's it.\n. I've got a few minutes to look at it now. I'll look into it.\n. Someone recently made a change to that expression... Let me find their PR. I merged it. I guess I didn't test it well enough. Another case for tests ;-)\n. Yeah, it was #61. Is that what broke us?\n. I would say +1 on not using \"default\". May consider removing that @astrism... People should just load the formlyData with the default values in my opinion.\n. I was looking into it and found that it was a little simpler than I had originally supposed, so I fixed the demo example and removed the default option. You should be able to setup the form data for a select. Let me know if you have trouble.\n. I'm not sure how that could be happening. If you could make a jsbin to\nreproduce the issue, then I could help more.\n- Kent C. Dodds\n  Sent from my mobile device, please forgive any errors or brevity.

Whoops, because the symlink was called bower_components it was ignored via the .gitignore. I think I'm going to remove that from the git ignore.

Actually, I want to keep the bower_components out of the src directory because they're more like vendor files than part of our source. Let me know if you disagree. But I think what I'll do is I'll change the place bower installs components to ignored_bower_components and we'll ignore that directory, then we'll create a symlink in the demo folder called bower_components that points to ignored_bower_components.

Awesome! Now all we need are tests that make that build passing actually mean something valuable :-)\n. Thanks for the recommendation @mwawrusch. I've looked into it for other projects but never gotten it setup. I'll create another issue for it.\n. Closing this because we have ok test coverage and we're adding tests all the time. Travis is purring along as well :-)\n. Closed with 4a9df974ed847620b69b6f599c908ae9922c4cad.\n. Perhaps it could fit into the library... What kind of api do you think would make it generic and useful to others?\n. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think @mwawrusch was talking about the length of text in an input but rather having multiples of the same input. Like a contact having multiple phone numbers. I'm thinking this would be difficult to generalize enough to support more than a single use case...\n. Yeah, I definitely believe it belongs in a standalone directive. Whether or not it's included in the library or not is another matter. I'm still on the fence on that one. @astrism?\n. Personally I'd like to see this implemented outside of the library before we think about bringing it in...\n. I like that. So @astrism, do you think that there should be a separate repo for angular-strap and ui-bootstrap templates altogether? I like the idea of having plugins. Thinking a separate repo for these seems appealing... Then you could install formly and the plugin you care about separately...\n. @mwawrusch, any progress on this? Is there any reason to keep this issue open?\n. I implemented something like this at work... Pretty simple. There are several ways to accomplish it based on your use case. I'll see if I can show an example sometime this week.\n. Ok, so I have some wicked abstractions on top of formly that make my life easier (hoping to bring them into some sort of generic formly template library eventually), but here's the meat of my multi-input template:\nhtml\n<div class=\"az-formly-multi-input\">\n  <div ng-class=\"{row: !$last}\" ng-repeat=\"item in result[options.key || index] track by $index\">\n    <az-formly-input class=\"no-padding\"\n                     ng-class=\"{'col-md-7': result[options.key || index].length > 1}\"\n                     options=\"options.data.inputOptions\"\n                     result=\"result[options.key || index]\"\n                     form=\"form\"\n                     index=\"$index\">\n    </az-formly-input>\n    <div class=\"col-md-5 plain-text\" ng-if=\"!$first\">\n      <az-action-link action=\"result[options.key || index].splice($index, 1)\">\n        <i class=\"fa fa-times\"></i> Remove Number\n      </az-action-link>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\nWhere the az-formly-input directive is simply the directive version of my formly input field. Then, I have a control elsewhere to add a new item (which amounts to just pushing an item to the result[options.key || index] array), but it would be pretty simple to place that wherever depending on your use case. I use this template with formly via this config:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'multi-input',\n  key: 'numbers',\n  data: {\n    inputOptions: {\n      required: true\n      // this is all the normal options you use for a formly field of type 'input'\n    }\n  }\n}\nAs far as having sub-forms, this would actually be relatively simple as well. You'd simply have a formly template that uses a formly-form directive and then you'd pass in all the data the formly-form needs.\nAlternatively, you would just manage this yourself (which I think would be preferable). It just really depends on your use case. If you think there's a good generic implementation with a good api that you think would provide what most people are looking for out of this then let me know, but I'm thinking that it's definitely a case-by-case situation here.\n. That plunker is using a version of formly that doesn't have field.runExpressions, so I'm not sure I understand what you mean.\nEither way, I think this is probably not the best way to accomplish what you're trying to do. Perhaps a better approach would be to have something like this:\nhtml\n<formly-form ng-repeat=\"user in vm.users\" fields=\"::vm.getUserFields()\" result=\"user\">\n  <button ng-click=\"vm.users.splice($index, 1)\">Remove User</button>\n</formly-form>\n<button ng-click=\"vm.users.push({})\">Add User</button>\nAnd then in the controller:\n``` javascript\nvar vm = this;\nvm.users = [];\nvm.getUserFields = getUserFields;\nfunction getUserFields() {\n  return [\n    {\n      key: 'firstName',\n      type: 'text',\n      label: 'First Name'\n    },\n    {\n      key: 'lastName',\n      type: 'text',\n      label: 'Last Name'\n    }\n  ];\n}\n```\nI think this approach makes the most sense. What do you think? If you think there's a way that formly could make this process simpler, I'm all ears. I want this to be as good if not better than the angular-schema-form module, so please let me know if you feel like it's lacking anything! :D\n. I'm still not certain that I understand the issue you're having. But I think that it may be related to the different contexts that expressions are evaluated under. watchers expressions evaluate with the form's scope, while expressionProperties and validators evaluate with the field's scope. See this for more info and reasonings for why.\nCould that be the cause problem you're seeing? I've made the remove and add buttons function properly (here) and everything seems to be functioning as expected. Let me know.\nAs for the infinite digest loop, perhaps you could use ng-init to set options.fields. This would prevent both problems. I understand your desire to keep form fields coupled with the rest of the fields it is supposed to represent. I think the ng-init approach in your sub-form template is a good way to go. Perhaps I'll look into that as well. Seems like a pretty reasonable solution.\nAs far as an improved API, I looked more closely at the angular-schema-form API and I didn't really get much inspiration from it. Their api fairly complex and I see some serious weaknesses with it (there are some obvious strengths as well). Either way, it's wildly different from formly.\n. A hah, it wasn't working as I thought it was. Here is a functioning plunk I think: http://plnkr.co/edit/Tb3zEBkD0keF4YvH203z?p=preview\nIt's using ng-init and seems to work well. Let me know what you think.\n. I think I finally understand the issue now. I think I have a little more time to spend on this problem tonight. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\n. Thanks for using formly! I am committed to formly as a vast majority of my projects require forms and formly simplifies my life immensely. I really want to make things even easier for everyone and I believe this sub-form concept is definitely a valuable use case to cover. When we're finished, hopefully we can get this into the template modules as well.\n. @kaylarose, Fixed! :facepunch: I switched over to jsbin because debugging angular in plunker is a bit of a pain. The issue was we actually were overwriting options.fields every time because options was referencing the upper field's options, not each form's options. Anyway, here's the solution. It's not too bad I think and it doesn't require a getFields function:\nhttp://jsbin.com/jaloz/2/edit?html,js\n. The :: is for one time binding introduced in angular 1.3.

Closing this as we seem to have a working solution now. If anyone has objections, let me know.\n. This is an interesting idea... What do you think this would do to our development lifecycle? Would it complicate things to have to pull down multiple repos to make sure you didn't break something? Or should we just make sure we have a solid test suite?\n\nOne thing I like about this is that most of the issues reported on this repo are template related. It would be nice to make that clear separation... I'm leaning toward this idea...\n. I think that nimbly should create the bootstrap and vanilla repos. Then other people could create their own template \"plugin\" repos as needed. But we already have the templates for those so we should just keep those with nimbly. I don't think a new org is necessary.\nI think we should take the opportunity with 0.1.0 to break as much as we need to get things where we want them to be right now. I'm hoping that the core will change very little after this, which is why I like splitting out the templates. Those repos will likely change a lot more than this one.\n. I'm fine with that. nbd\n. Perhaps we could put that logic in formly-core? In the config provider just have a method called setupNormalTemplates or something and the template repos would have a config to do this? Just a thought.\n. Sweet glory! Thanks @astrism!\n. Done and done :+1: Thanks! This will inspire me to increase the coverage of the codebase. I'm sure it's pretty low right now considering I just started writing tests for it a few months ago :-/\n. Yeah, I use coveralls for api-check (which fails if it has anything less than 100% code coverage :-D). Thanks for doing this. I think that I'm going to put some time into writing more tests to bring the coverage up before I add the badge to the readme though. It's a little embarrassing... I'll try to get that done asap. Thanks!\n. Closing this in favor of a single issue\n. I think that this library has a good setup for this... https://github.com/alianza-dev/angular-scope-types\n. Finally done!\n. Looks good to me. @astrism was the one who made changes in there recently, so I'll let him review this and verify it was a simple mistake and merge this fix in.\n. @antoinepairet, note, there will be a number of breaking changes in 0.1.0, so just be prepared to upgrade.\n. This wasn't a duplicate. This was the bootstrap version for the fix. Reopening and merging.\n. Looks like your formatting is incorrect there (spaces instead of tabs). I think we need to add jshint to our travis build.\n. :+1: \n. Sorry we sort of missed this one @antoinepairet, but looking at it again this is actually not how templates work. The template property is an actual string that is the template. If you want to specify a templateUrl then that's another property you can specify and we get that from the template cache.\n. Looks like a better direction to go would be to use jscs\n. I would simply add:\njavascript\nvar stopWatching = $scope.$watch('formData.language', function(newValue) {\n  if (!newValue) {\n    return;\n  }\n  stopWatching();\n  // Move on\n});\nRemember that the formFields keys are the values on formData so you can do this just fine.\nAnother option is to use the watch property on fields. It's basically the same concept, except it provides you with the field as the first parameter so you have a little more flexibility if you need it. But I would recommend going the normal watch route first.\nAlso, I'm not crazy about the use of $parent in your template. Instead of that, you could do what we do in the example in custom-template and do:\nhtml\n<li ng-repeat=\"option in options.options\"><a class=\"button expand\" ng-click=\"result[options.key || index] = option.value;\" >{{option.name}}</a></li>\nNotice you don't need to invoke optionsData() either as formly will take care of setup the options object on your scope for you.\nPlease close this issue if this resolves your concern.\n.

Thanks for doing this!\n. Thanks a bunch!\n. You probably have a really hard time with vendor libraries huh? :-/\n\nWe're not going to adjust the templates to support your use case. Here are a couple options you have (in order of recommendation):\n1. Don't render templates with Django. There are many reasons why you should just have your server act as purely a services layer and serve your static files (html, css, js) on a CDN.\n2. Just use formly.min.js instead of the templates and make your own templates. That stinks, I know, and I'm sorry that you have to render your stuff server side as well.\nGood luck to you!\n. Give me an example of a library that does support this so I can see how they did it.\n. You're right. Angular-UI Bootstrap is using $interpolate to construct some of their templates. Not all of them though, for example, in this plunker I don't know how the alert is working because it uses {{ }} in the alert.html template...\nI've gotten a hack working in this plunker. If you look at setElementTemplate in the formly-field directive, around line 140, I've added a check for the start and end symbols and I do a replace for those in the templates.\nI think that this is the only reasonable solution. I don't expect this to really cause serious issues. It would not affect those not changing the symbols so I think that I'll put it in. I'll make a PR and I'll let @astrism look at it and merge it.\nThanks for not giving up on me @khasinski. Once again I'm reminded that I don't know everything...\n. It will go into master which is a little different from 0.0.16 (which you're likely using. You'll have to point your bower to the hash of the build commit to get the latest stuff. See CHANGELOG.md to see the breaking changes. They should have fairly minimal impact on you as I expect you have very little integration with formly as it is.\nThe PR is coming in a few minutes, but I want @astrism to have a look at it before it's merged.\n. @khasinski, technically, you should be able to point to this hash and start using the fix right away: 79cdc6d231da0655ba2a29aab3bbcb52d5961431\nNote: I noticed that using [[ ]] broke one of the demo's custom templates. I didn't look too much into it because using a different start and end symbol fixed the issue just fine and because it's a custom template you'll have total control over it. I just thought you'd like to know you may have to work around some things.\nMay the force be with you :-)\n. :+1: @astrism \n. Here are the templates with the appropriate changes:\n- vanilla\n- bootstrap\n. With version 0.0.16, the submit button works just the same as it always has. See here for information on how to configure options for the submit button.\nIn master, things have been changed around a bit where the formly-form doesn't have a submit button. This is leading up to our 0.1.0 update which will hopefully happen as soon as @astrism returns from his travels.\nIf you're running on master, then you'll benefit from looking at how the demo adds a submit button. If you're on 0.0.16 then I'm not certain what your issue is. If your developer made a custom build of formly I would recommend that you don't do that... Just let us know what was lacking from formly and we'll see what we can do to support your use cases...\n. Good plan. If we don't provide the proper apis, please let me know...\n. In 0.0.16, the ability to configure formly to use ng-if instead of ng-hide was implemented and the formly-form.html template was removed. This was an enhancement and not a breaking change.\nThe part of the template that checks hideSubmit is here. In the compile function below, the template is altered based on whether the form is supposed to use ng-if. Let me know if there's a bug in there that needs to be fixed.\nYou may also consider updating to master as this is the direction we're heading soon anyway. See the changelog for the breaking changes your new developer will need to account for.\n. Hmmm... There may be some changes, but I believe the api should remain pretty stable. If you like, I'll make sure to let you know when there are any breaking changes. Honestly, I would recommend simply using the hash in your bower dependency so you don't get auto-upgraded.\nBut I believe the api should be consistent. However, one major change upcoming will be when we break formly away from the templates and break them out into separate repositories. This should be coming pretty soon and the dist folder for this repository will contain only formly.js and formly.min.js. You'll have to add a dependency on the template directory of your choice to get the built-in templates you enjoy now. \nI've created an issue (#94) where I'll post when things like this happen if you'd like to stay up to date.\n. I'm going to close this for now as the root issue was resolved.\n. We're still waiting on @astrism to split out the templates into their own repositories and transition this repository to be owned by the angular-formly org... Once that happens, we can probably get this released soon.\n. Before we push 1.0.0, could we implement this suggestion I make in this comment on #107?\n. Perfect\n- Kent C.

Noticed you got the repo transferred. Awesome. Perhaps you can create an angular-formly shell repo in nimbly for gh-pages. Even though github.com/nimbly/angular-formly will forward to github.com/angular-formly/angular-formly, the demo page http://nimbly.github.io/angular-formly/ does not forward.\n. As another note, I'm in the process of developing react-formly. I'm thinking it may make sense to put it in the same org? Thoughts on this? What if we renamed the org to \"formly\" and the template repos had an angular or react prefix to the repo name??\n. Awesome, so I suggest the org name should be simply \"formly\" then we'd have:\n\nangular\n- angular-formly\n- angular-formly-templates-bootstrap\n- angular-formly-templates-vanilla\nreact\n- react-formly\n- react-formly-templates-bootstrap\n- react-formly-templates-vanilla\nYou can feel free to just worry about the angular repos for now I think. I'll create the react ones when they're ready.\nAre those names too verbose?\n. Hmmm.... Well, what do you think about the idea of creating a single JSON powered form solution to rule them all that just has adapters for other libraries/frameworks/etc.?\n. I know that Jason is doing that with angular-data right now. He's creating a more generic js-data in vanilla javascript and then creating hooks for angular/ember/backbone/react/etc... What if we did that for forms?\nWhat if we did js-forms?\n. Then we could work on abstracting out the pieces that rely on angular... Perhaps the core would be pretty minimal... This may not be necessary. Because we're pretty reliant on the framework currently. I wonder if it makes sense. But I'm tired of re-implementing things every time a new shiney framework comes along. Would be nice to just have a generic solution that could be adapted to the framework...\n. It would be really awesome if you could have the exact same data structure to control the form elements and swap out the view layer and everything would still work. That would be pretty amazing.\n. Valid point @gizmoboy, but unfortunately, there are compelling reasons to move to something like react. It's not just that it's shiney and new.\n. I'll let you decide what you want to do @astrism. Either way is fine with me.\n. Good point. I don't know what you could abstract. As far as a spec, I highly doubt there's a spec in existence. We could probably make our own...\nStarted this, got pulled off...\nhttps://github.com/angular-formly/angular-formly/wiki/JSON-Specification\n. That's fine with me.\n. Huzzah!\nKent C.

Would love to create an alliance between the two libraries. Let's move this discussion to their repo: kelp404/angular-form-builder#50\n. FYI to any interested. Some major updates have been made since 1.0.0 was released. I believe it may be wise to cut a 2.0.0 before too long. @astrism and I plan to meet next month, we will likely be cutting the new version at that time (either that, or we'll release what we have now as 2.0.0 and make additional updates as 3.0.0).\n\nMy current project that relies heavily on formly is pointing to a SHA in it's bower.json for formly. I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend that for anyone else, but if you want to get all the sweet new api changes and improvements I recommend looking at your upgrade path by seeing the changelog.\n. Made some additional major changes that will require (hopefully minor) find/replace changes in templates. The most notable (since I last mentioned it):\n- watch changed to watcher\n- formly-form attribute name changed to form to be more clear about what's going on.\n- Removed options from formly-form. The id of the form is now generated by formly.\n- Renaming formField to formControl - This will likely require the biggest change for your templates.\n- No longer expecting options.key for the name attribute of ng-model elements. Now expecting id. Also, formly will automatically attach the formControl to the form for each field that doesn't have noFormControl: true. A suppressible warning will be logged if the formControl cannot be found. This will also require some rework of your custom templates. The master branches of the bootstrap and vanilla templates have this update.\nI realize that some of these changes are pretty significant and may require a bit of work on people's part to get things working with the upcoming version of formly. But I believe that the api to formly is improved big time. Still a little more to do (especially with template utilities), but I believe we're headed in the right direction! Please keep feature requests coming!\n. Another big change today. Changing from the name result to model. This makes the purpose of the attribute more clear. This will be part of the 2.0.0 release coming soon (hopefully).\n. Anyone mind me closing this issue? Let me know and I'll reopen it.\n. Hmmm... I'm not sure I understand the complications you described. To get the most basic thing setup, see this codepen\n. The \"controller as\" syntax is recommended, but not required. Glad you got it working.\n. I actually saw this bug this morning. I know what it is. It came in when I added validation. You have to give your form a name. I'll fix this bug later, but if you give your form a name that should solve the problem:\nhtml\n<formly-form name=\"formName\" result=\"formData\" fields=\"formFields\" options=\"formOptions\" ng-submit=\"onSubmit()\">\n</formly-form>\n. Just realized that I pushed another build which may make this one have a merge issue. I guess this is why you don't build the project in a PR. I'll try to remove that commit from this PR.\n. We're not going to merge this in. If you want to use a different start and end symbol, you'll have to provide your own templates.\n. That's perfect. Thanks!\n. Good to have you back @astrism :-)\n. Looks awesome. I'll merge, then pull, build, and push, and redeploy. Thanks!\n. Awesome, if anyone needs this right now they can point to e3d165a72d6c4a9c56819c4c8d0c885cee34b490 in their bower and get this feature. Hopefully we'll be able to release a new version soon.

So, you're right, the $error property comes from angular's Form Controller. You could glean more information using angular's NgModelController's $error. If a field template has an input with an ng-model that utilizes the formly-dynamic-name directive, then the field will have a formField which will have the $error populated by the NgModelController. You can get more fine grained information using this formField. All the built-in templates should have this currently.\nWe definitely appreciate the contributions!\n. Closing this issue for now. If you want to take a whack at it, that'd be awesome. Just trying to clean things up a bit.\n. Hmmm... Good point... I think instead we should use $timeout. I'll push a fix soon.\n.

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but you can't put an ng-model on an li element. It simply doesn't work in that context.

Try this Will that do what you want?\n. Then at that point you could simply add a watcher in the controller of your directive to watch for changes that would update the value, and manually update the value yourself (ie, not in the template).\n. Nice catch. That needs to be fixed. Thanks...\nWith regards to the submit button. This has been a breaking change. You now provide your own submit button via transclusion in the formly-form directive.\n. No, the reason for it is on the latest stuff, we created a templateless\nbuild. This became formly.js.

Hi @micouz, trying to clean up old issues, is this resolved?\n. Sorry, meant to wait for you to respond before I closed it. Now I'll wait for you to respond before I reopen it :-)\n. The second argument to a validator.validate function is the scope which has a result. You can use that result to determine whether the input is valid based on other fields. https://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly#validators-objectarray\n. There is an example.\n\nYou are correct. All the validators do currently is add parsers to the ngModelCtrl of a field. They have no concept of error messaging and they shouldn't. It should be the role of the template to display errors to the user.\nPerhaps we could add error messages to the templates as you see here, but that's definitely a template responsibility, not a formly core resopnsibility.\n. Having a function is not valid json. It becomes an object at that point... If you need valid json then you need to use an expression rather than a function. Something like this should do the same thing you were trying to do:\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"validate\": \"'sam'===value\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\nObviously, this isn't as complicated as what you're trying to accomplish, so your expression will be a little complex... Not sure why you need it to be 100% JSON, but it should be possible regardless, albeit a little ugly and long...\n. Here's an example expression referencing another field's value:\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"otherSample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"someOption\": \"awesomesauce\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"validate\": \"results.otherSample === 'sweetness' && options.someOption === 'awesomesauce' && value === 'sam'\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\nDo you have a suggestion of how what you're trying to do could be supported better?\n. I can see how that solution could be done and I don't have a problem using eval with an opt-in type behavior on the validator (instead of validate it would be dangerouslyValidate or something). But just want to make sure that it's going to be useful to someone if we do.\nI'd probably make it so whatever is being \"dangerously validated\" would have the scope in scope of the function so it could be used. Here's an example of using the api that there could be:\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"otherSample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"someOption\": \"awesomesauce\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"dangerouslyValidate\": \"(function() { var someCheck = results.otherSample.match(/^sweet.*ness$/g) && options.someOption.length > 3; if (someCheck) { return value.some(function(x) { return x.charCodeAt(0) > 100; }); } else { return value === 'sam'; } })();\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\nNotice that\n1. you can do more complex stuff (like if statements, regexes, and you could do loops) that you can't do with angular's $parse service.\n2. You have access to results, options, and value.\n3. You provide a self-invoking function\nWould this be a reasonable api?\nHere's an example implementation that works:\njavascript\nfunction evaluate(results, options, value, script) {\n  return eval(script);\n}\nvar dangerouslyValidate = \"(function() { var someCheck = results.otherSample.match(/^sweet.*ness$/g) && options.someOption.length > 3; if (someCheck) { return value.some(function(x) { return x.charCodeAt(0) > 100; }); } else { return value === 'sam'; } })();\";\nvar results = { otherSample: 'sweetness' };\nvar options = { someOption: 'lo' };\nvar value = 'sam';\nvar validates = evaluate(results, options, value, dangerouslyValidate);\nconsole.log(validates); // logs true\nWould love @astrism to weigh in here.\n. @gizmoboy, sorry this was never implemented. Do you still need this functionality?\n. Closing this for now unless someone asks for this functionality again.\n. @4ware, you don't need to use a function to do that. You can easily do that using the string version of a Formly Expression\n. Nothing like this was ever added and I don't expect it ever will be. If you need to do regex that's already possible via a pattern. See the Mac Address configuration in this example. Also, you can get pretty far with putting complex logic on the client and referencing that logic in your config using fieldTransforms.\nGood luck.. Wow @acido69, you've uncovered a very serious issue in our build. Thanks a ton! I'll make a comment or two on some lines in the PR. If you could address those then I think we'll pull this in. Thanks again!\n. That's an awesome refactor. Thanks for doing that. We need to think about this in the context of us breaking out the templates into their own repositories now that the organization has been created and the repo has been moved over... I think we may want to hold on this one :-/\n. @astrism, the entire build will need to change since we're splitting the templates out, so I'd say yes.\n. Thanks for the PR. I believe the original issue has been fixed.\n. Please see the note in the first line under the Documentation\n. That's not a valid expression unfortunately. The $parse service (used by $compile rejects it). You'd have to do something like this:\njavascript\ntemplate: '<div>Today\\'s date is {{ options.data.now | date:MM/dd/yyyy }}</div>',\ndata: {\n  now: new Date()\n}\nAlternatively you could do that logic in a directive controller or something...\n.

(I may\n  have used speech to text...)\n\nThanks for nice module!\nBut it's almost useless without having an opportunity to customize form's\nmarkup (not a single form field)\nFor example, how would one achieve a simple container for in the markup for\nthe fields of the same type?\nThanks in advance for you support, maybe i was just not so patient and\nthere is such a possibility.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/115.\n. Feel free to use this template to demonstrate what you're trying to do.\n. People are free to using the formly-field directive if they like. There's nothing stopping them. I still have no idea what you want us to do? What about the current API needs to change to accomplish what you're trying to do?\n. Yes, except it's even simpler:\njavascript\n{\n  template: '<hr />'\n}\nThis \"just works\" because the way things work. It's more of a coincidence, but yeah, you can do that.\n. Going to close this for now, please re-open if it has not been resolved.\n. There is a limitation angular. There's no way to know when something has rendered. If you're trying to do this, there's probably a better way to accomplish what you're actually trying to accomplish. We could add a callback parameter to the link function, but this wouldn't be exactly what you're looking for... What are you trying to do?\n. Way cool. Thanks @nicolechung!\n. I'm fine with it. Personally, I prefer all my templates to be wrapped in a single div for consistency, but if someone wants to do this, that's fine with me.\n. Sounds fine to me!\n. Thanks for letting us know. I'll be able to fix this soon.\n. As in tomorrow probably...\n. @circlingthesun, could you show me where that line exists? I can't seem to find anywhere in the code that has the line $scope.options.default...\nIn fact, there's nowhere in the code at all that uses the keyword default. I'm guessing that you're using an older version of formly. I would recommend upgrading to the latest version (1.0.0 as of today).\n. There is no tutorial, but you can have Bootstrap as an example. It's actually quite simple. Actually, I just created a new templates repository angular-formly-templates-foundation that's basically a copy of the angular-foundation-templates-bootstrap repo. If you are willing and able, we'd love it if you could submit a PR to that to change the templates from bootstrap to foundation!\nThere's an initial release milestone on the repo with a few issues in it. You could do everyone a big favor by submitting a PR to close those issues and get that repo out the door if you can!\n. Closing this here to move discussion over to angular-formly-templates-foundation.\n. This is awesome, but it's outside formly's role. You could easily do this yourself just using formly.\n. If I get time @gladson, but I don't think I'll have time to create your app for you...\n. Just as a recommendation of an approach, you'd just have an ng-repeat on the models and pass that in to the result attribute.\n. Good luck! Let us know if you get it working and if there's anything the formly-js core can do to improve the api to make what you're trying to do simpler.\n. @psi-4ward, yes, this is not a problem for the core to solve. I have a project where I do something similar to this and all I do is have a separate form for each subform.\n. Here's an example. Obviously you'd need to style it yourself... http://plnkr.co/edit/fft0F5ZMtY3fOw6Js9hb?p=preview\n. Done :-)\n. Not certain off the top of my head. If you could reproduce the issue then maybe I can figure out why this is happening. Thanks!\n. I added it. It's been in for a little bit. It should actually work on a formly-form so I'm not sure why it's not working for you. The directive itself is pretty simple (though it could be improved by using the compile function instead of a controller...). If you're using angular 1.3 then the name attribute is interpolatable and you wont need the directive anyway.\nThe reason it was added is for field validation. The only way to get validation on an ng-model is by putting a name attribute on the same element and for that element to be a child of a named form. Prior to 1.3, the name attribute couldn't be dynamic. So this directive was a work around to that.\n. I'm not sure what you mean by \"also take local values\" can you explain what you mean?\n. I see. I'm thinking we'll want to rework the formly-dynamic-name directive a little bit to use the compile function instead of a a controller. I'm pretty busy at work right now but hopefully I will have some time soon to address this.\n. Until I get time to fix the root issue, one way you could work around it is by making sure that the forms on your page exist on separate scopes. That way you can give them each a hard coded name and not worry about collisions. In my project I have a directive that wraps formly so I can abstract away the dependency and have some good defaults. You could do the same. If you need a reference to the form, then you can add that as a doubly bound attribute and \"pass it back\" in that way.\nThis is my implementation of this (note, I'm using controller as syntax, if you're not familiar with that then Todd Motto has a good explanation:\n``` javascript\n// az-form.js\nangular.module('atac.common').directive('azForm', function azFormDirective(COMMON_URL, ) {\n  'use strict';\n  return {\n    restrict: 'E',\n    templateUrl: COMMON_URL + 'directives/components/az-form.html',\n    scope: {\n      form: '=?',\n      result: '=',\n      fields: '=',\n      formId: '@',\n      onSubmit: '&'\n    },\n    transclude: true,\n    bindToController: true,\n    controllerAs: 'vm',\n    controller: function() {\n      var vm = this;\n      vm.id = vm.formId || (vm.result || {}).id || Math.random() * 999999;\n      vm.describedFields = .filter(vm.fields, function(item) {\n        return item.hasOwnProperty('description');\n      });\n    },\n    link: function(scope, el, attrs) {\n      if (attrs.hasOwnProperty('form')) {\n        var stopWatching = scope.$watch('azForm', function(form) {\n          if (angular.isDefined(form)) {\n            stopWatching();\n            scope.vm.form = form;\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  };\n});\n```\nhtml\n<!-- az-form.html -->\n<formly-form name=\"azForm\"\n             novalidate\n             result=\"vm.result\"\n             fields=\"vm.fields\"\n             options=\"::{uniqueFormId: vm.id}\"\n             class=\"space-inputs\"\n             ng-submit=\"vm.onSubmit(result)\">\n  <div class=\"col-md-9 col-md-offset-3 text-muted margin-top5 margin-bottom15\" ng-if=\"vm.describedFields.length\">\n    <div ng-repeat=\"field in ::vm.describedFields\">{{field.description}}</div>\n  </div>\n  <ng-transclude></ng-transclude>\n</formly-form>\nThen I have one place where I use it like so:\nhtml\n<az-form result=\"vm.userInfo\"\n         form=\"vm.userFormRef\"\n         fields=\"vm.formFields\"\n         on-submit=\"vm.login(vm.userInfo)\">\n  <div class=\"action-buttons col-md-offset-9 col-md-3\">\n    <button type=\"submit\"\n            ng-disabled=\"vm.userFormRef.$invalid\"\n            class=\"btn btn-primary az-btn\"\n            az-loading-button=\"vm.loggingIn\">\n      Sign In\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</az-form>\nI hope this helps.\n. FYI @kbdaitch, the current version of formly in master has a breaking change that may impact you so I thought I'd let you know. Instead of using the form tag, formly now uses ng-form which doesn't work with ng-submit or submit the form with a button[type=\"submit\"]. This is truly unfortunate and kinda lame, however it allows you to nest forms properly (as HTML doesn't actually allow you to nest form elements).\nIf you really want ng-submit and submit buttons to work for you, I feel you. So much that I made it work anyway. Here's what I did, maybe you can benefit:\n``` javascript\n(function() {\n  'use strict';\nangular.module('atac.common').directive('ngForm', ngForm);\nfunction ngForm() {\n    return {\n      restrict: 'E',\n      link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n        var ngForm = scope.$eval(attrs.name);\n        if (ngForm) {\n          ngForm.azSubmit = function() { // <-- named azSubmit because az is my app's prefix\n            if (ngForm.$invalid) {\n              return;\n            }\n            var context = scope;\n            if (attrs.hasOwnProperty('submitFormOnParent')) {\n              context = scope.$parent;\n            }\n            ngForm.azSubmitting = context.$eval(attrs.ngSubmit);\n            scope.$safeApply(); // <-- you'll need to implement this\n            return ngForm.azSubmitting;\n          };\n          element.on('keyup', function(event) {\n            if (event.which === 13 && attrs.ngSubmit) {\n              ngForm.azSubmit();\n            }\n          });\n          var submitButton = element.find('[type=submit]');\n          if (submitButton.length === 1) {\n            submitButton.on('keyup', function(event) {\n              if (event.which === 32 || event.which === 13) {\n                ngForm.azSubmit();\n              }\n            });\n            submitButton.on('click', function(event) {\n              ngForm.azSubmit();\n            });\n          } else if (!.isEmpty(submitButton)) {\n            throw new Error('Forms should only have one submit button');\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    };\n  }\n})();\n```\nHope that's helpful when you decide to upgrade formly when we cut 2.0.\n. That approach sounds fine to me. @gizmoboy has done some interesting things with dynamic data in formly. Perhaps he has some tips...\n. Coming back through some issues. Reading this again, I think I misunderstood the question. If you want to pre-populate a form with values, you simply need to set values on the model. The form is a reflection of the current state of the model (aka result). So, if I had:\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"user\" fields=\"fields\"></formly-form>\njavascript\n$scope.fields = [\n  { type: 'text', key: 'firstName' }\n];\nthen all I would have to do to pre-populate the form with some default value would be\njavascript\n$scope.user = {\n  firstName: 'Grant'\n};\nDoes this make sense/cover your use case?\n. Closing this issue for now because inactivity.\n. Closed via 4b44e60603ef94947ca44dcc8d82094d1981f719\n. See this plunker. It's quite simple.\nhtml\n<div>\n  {{options.label}}\n  <input ng-model=\"result[options.key]\" type=\"date\" />\n</div>\nThen style it however you wish...\n. The new wrapper functionality makes this a much better experience. I don't know if we can quite get to where I was hoping for this one, but we're in a pretty good place I think!\n. Thank you. This is great news that it'll be fixed (hopefully) in 1.3.4 :-)\n. :clap: \n. Hi @sucheendra, the best way to get help is to follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nFor your first question, you'll simply set the type property in templateOptions to number and that should do it for you.\nFor your second question, please go to that help link and create an example of what you mean.\n. This can be accomplished by specifying a model for the field like so:\njs\n$scope.foobar = {\n  foo: {\n    bar: 'hello'\n  }\n};\n$scope.fields = [{\n  model: $scope.foobar.foo,\n  key: 'bar'\n}];\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"foobar\" fields=\"fields\" />\nThis is supported as of 9f10f57e99ed5100f49f9eec48e5a051cfe60bfe\n. Done\n. FYI @astrism.\n. Hmmm... I just looked at the demo and it seems to work fine for me... @astrism?\n. Oh, understood. I'd rather just pull the template specific information out of the docs (see #133)\n. We moved all this info to the template docs.\n. Good feedback. I have accomplished this with my own set of field types. It's fairly simple. We have thought about making a repo for generic templates like this one. Stay tuned.\n. Another easy way to do this is to simply have two forms.\n. Totally. I don't know what the process is like, but these variations would be awesome:\n- latest: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/dist/formly.js\n- stable: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/1.0.0/dist/formly.js\n@astrism will be releasing 2.0.0 soon, would be good to get that on cdnjs as well. At that time, 2.0.0 would be stable and 1.0.0 would be legacy.\nIs it possible to have CDNJS pull from master to get latest anytime there's a commit to latest? If not, then there's no reason to have latest. Thanks.\n. Understood.\n. Hi @snimavat, could you please provide a link to a jsbin that demonstrates the issue (clone this template). I use controller as in all of my projects and things work just fine for me so if I see what you're doing I'm sure I can identify what the problem is.\n. By putting the name attribute on the formly-form, the form controller is bound to the isolate scope of the formly-form directive. You'll want to place it on the surrounding form element like so:\nhttp://jsbin.com/qubozo/1/edit?html,js,output\n. Please close this issue if it is resolved.\n. You're right. I'll take another q look at this when I get the chance.\n- Kent C.

Yes, angular-fromly adds the name attribute for you and binds a form attribute for you to alleviate confusion. So, you'd do this instead:\n\nhtml\n<formly-form form=\"activateSimForm\" model=\"simModel\" fields=\"simFields\"></formly-form>\nIf that doesn't solve your issue, please open a new issue :-)\n.

Yeah, you're going to need custom templates for those. For the multi-small-form stuff, I would recommend what we ended up doing in #76 here. For multi-select, you'll have to come up with something on your own, though I know there are several libraries that claim to do this quite easily. For file upload, you'll need to create your own template to do this. I recommend using a directive similar to the exampleSubform in the multi-small-form example so you can add a controller to do the actual upload. Good luck!\n. @abodacs, have you resolved your issue?\n. Thanks! I'm not sure what you're asking about. Are you talking about json-schema.org? I have no experience with that, but you're not the first to ask about this. #114 is about the same thing I believe. Could you explain what benefits we'd get from this. And how do you envision this being included?\n. Just to confirm, by\nYou (the Formly maintainer(s)) can use other validators (like TV4) to do the validation and not write/maintain validation related code.\n\nyou're talking about use validating the field configuration to verify that it is correct? So we can warn the developer when they provide a config that is incorrect.\n. I apologize. I've never had any experience with JSON Schemas. So please understand if I just don't get it. But if I understand you correctly, you're saying that the FDD could validate the model which to me doesn't make any sense. The FDD describes the fields that represent the model. They do have a validators property, but that's a JavaScript/angular specific thing.\nOne thing that might make sense is to add a schema property to the field config that allows you to use a JSON Schema validator to validate the model. This would be in lieu of validators but would behave just like validators in that it would $setValidity for the NgModelController based on whether the schema validation passed. Would this be a good api to accomplish what you're talking about?\nBy the way, sorry I closed #114... I should have pursued it further or at least asked you before closing it.\n. This is very interesting. I think I'm finally getting it :laughing:\nSo, I'm thinking to enable this, we'd do something like this:\njavascript\nangular.module('yourModule').config(function(formlyConfigProvider) {\n  formlyConfigProvider.schemaValidator(function(data, schema) {\n    var invalidValidators = validateSchema(data, schema);\n    return !invalidValidators.length ? true : invalidValidators;\n  });\n});\nWhere invalidValidators would be something like:\njson\n[\"required\", \"maxLength\"]\nAnd formly would take the invalidValidators and apply it to the NgModelController via $setValidity and you could use it with ngMessages like so:\nhtml\n<div ng-messages=\"options.formControl.$error\">\n  <div ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div>\n  <div ng-message=\"maxLength\">Input too long</div>\n</div>\nDo you think this would be acceptable? Do you think that I'm missing anything?\n. And of course that validateSchema function would likely call into tv4 or something similar, but I don't want to include that library in formly. I'd like people to bring in whatever they'd like. Oh, and the schemaValidator function would be called anytime a field's model changed (based on a $watch). What do you think?\n. Oh, and just to be clear. schema is the FDD for the field and data is the model for the field (this would be field.model || what is passed to formly-form). Would that work?\n. That's a significant departure from the current API. It's also a little more complicated api as well. The simplicity of angular-formly is one of its strong points. I don't think that we want to change the default api to do this...\nHowever, I can definitely see the value. I think we may be able to detect that the given fields are a schema and generate the fields from the schema. So we'd do something like this:\njs\nvm.model = { /* your model here */ };\nvm.schema = { /* your schema here */ };\nvm.fields = {}; // set just so we have reference to it in our javascript\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"vm.model\" schema=\"vm.schema\" fields=\"vm.fields\"></formly-form>\nThen, formly would generate the fields based on the schema and assign it to your vm.fields and it would invoke the schemaValidator function with the schema as described above any time the model changed.\nI believe that the schema you recommended would be converted to something like this:\njs\n[\n  {\n    key: 'name', // property name\n    hide: false, // !defaultVisible\n    label: 'Name', // title\n    description: 'Your name...' // use placeholder if you want a placeholder\n    required: true // from required array\n    data: {\n      // anything that's not part of the JSON specification will go in here\n      maxLength: 60\n    }\n  },\n  { /* etc. */ }\n]\nPlease note, this does not at all change formly's default api. It may also make things a little tricky to do anything creative if you do things this way. I'm also not promising that this would actually be possible. But I believe it should be.\n. Would love help in the branch I started out. I'm not very familiar with this. I've pushed the 2.0.0 release anyway. We'll add this in a future version.\n. I think this should be part of a plugin, so I've created a new repo for that plugin. Anyone is welcome to implement it. https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-json-schema/issues/1\n. First of all, you're very welcome :+1: Glad you've found it useful!\nI'm not able to reproduce any issue whatsoever. No matter how much I change and move around, the field disappears when type is not equal to 1 which is the condition...\n. I'm changing everything I can. Here's what I see: http://cl.ly/3047330u1V19\n. So you're saying that when form2 is selected, you want type === 1 to show the text field and when form1 is selected, you want type === 2 to show the text field? I'm totally confused... What are you trying to accomplish?\n. Oh, I get what's going on. One gotcha with formly (that should probably be documented) is that you can't re-use the exactly same fields between multiple forms. Another thing that you should avoid doing is using the same form for for multiple models. This is because when angular watchers are run, the model for the field may not be the model that you're expecting. So instead, for this case, where you have the same fields representing multiple models, I recommend each form having it's own copy of the fields and each formly-form having one model that doesn't get entirely swapped out (individual properties can be swapped of course, just not the entire object).\nHere's an updated (working) plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/z9SHYESTDGNHCN1bn0AX?p=preview\n. If this resolves your issue, please close it :-)\n. Sure, I copied the formFields upfront because I knew how many I needed, but you could easily copy them later, or create a function that returns a fresh copy of the fields. Like so:\njs\nfuncton getFields() {\n  return [\n    // your fields\n  ];\n}\nthis would also ensure that each instance of the fields is unique. Then just invoke that every time you need a new copy.\n. Well, that all depends on how many forms you've got... Let's move this to gitter so we can chat more quickly.\n. (\u00f3 \u00ec_\u00ed)=\u00f3\u00f2=(\u00ec_\u00ed \u00f2) Good luck!\n. ... Github... Messed up my emoji... (\u00f3 \u00ec_\u00ed)=\u00f3\u00f2=(\u00ec_\u00ed \u00f2)\n. I'm not sure I understand your question... It sounds like you know what to do. You have the right idea that you'll want to create a custom template for this functionality. From there you can do whatever you like. See the wiki on custom templates for what's available.\n. And what I was saying is that the option \"mask\" doesn't have to be implemented in formly for you to use it in a custom template. Either way, we're definitely not going to implement it in formly core as it wouldn't make sense. If you would like it added to one of the template libraries, create an issue there and we can discuss it...\n. What version of angular-formly are you using? The current version of master has significant changes from the released version. I recommend using the latest version in master as we'll be releasing this very soon and it comes with a lot of improvements.\nNote, that in the latest (master) version, the attribute has changed from result to model and the options attribute has been removed.\nJust by looking at your code, it appears you're doing everything else just fine. If making those changes doesn't fix your issue, could you please provide an example by cloning this jsbin template (File -> Clone)? Thanks!\n. Great! I'm glad you got it working. Let us know if you need any more help. Thanks!\n. So, just to confirm, you want the user to be able to check multiple of those right? Or are they limited to only one? If they're limited to one, then just use the radio button. If you just want to have one field label associated with multiple checkboxes (each with their own label) then you'll have to make your own template. I would recommend copying the radio button template and changing it to a checkbox. Like so:\nhtml\n<div class=\"radio-group\"\n     ng-class=\"{'has-error': options.formControl.$invalid}\">\n    <label class=\"control-label\">\n        {{options.label}}\n        {{options.required ? '*' : ''}}\n    </label>\n    <div class=\"radio\"\n         ng-repeat=\"(key, option) in options.options\">\n        <label>\n            <input type=\"checkbox\"\n                   formly-dynamic-name=\"id + '_'+ $index\"\n                   formly-custom-validation=\"options.validators\"\n                   id=\"{{id + '_'+ $index}}\"\n                   aria-describedby=\"{{id}}_description\"\n                   ng-value=\"option.value\"\n                   ng-required=\"options.required\"\n                   ng-model=\"$parent.model[$parent.options.key || $parent.index]\">\n            {{option.name}}\n        </label>\n        <p id=\"{{id}}_description\"\n           class=\"help-block\"\n           ng-if=\"option.description\">\n            {{option.description}}\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n. @maryampashmi, it's because you have the hiddenWhenUnchecked field as part of the options of the checkbox-template field. Also, unless your template is doing something interesting/odd, options shouldn't have a key. Your hide expressionProperty should reference Q2 being the value of the more option. Try this:\njson\n{\n    \"key\": \"Q2\",\n    \"type\": \"checkbox-template\",\n    \"label\": \"What are the most important language to learn?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"english\",\n        \"value\": \"eng\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"spanish\",\n        \"value\": \"spnsh\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"french\",\n        \"value\": \"frnch\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"more\",\n        \"value\": \"more\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": \"hiddenWhenUnchecked\",\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"line\": 4,\n    \"label\": \"Please write down if you consider another languages\",\n    \"placeholder\": \"chinese\",\n    \"expressionProperties\": {\n      \"hide\": \"model.Q2 !== 'more'\"\n    }\n  }\nIf that doesn't work, please provide an example using this jsbin as a template.\n. @maryampashmi, did this resolve your issue? Please close this issue if so.\n. Good point. I'm actually in the process of creating a series on egghead.io for angular-formly. Stay tuned! :D\n. What you're experiencing is why the pre-built templates don't support ng-pattern already. You have a few options. You can either:\n1. Create a custom template that uses ng-pattern (called pattern-input for example) and just use it when you need to supply a pattern\n2. Use a validator instead (I recommend this) where you validate it based on regex.\nGood luck\n. @rahil471, did this resolve your issue? Please close this issue if so.\n. Closing this. Let me know if your issue was unresolved.\n. Whoops, can't believe we didn't see that earlier. I'm not certain that it's worth fixing at this point. I'll be releasing 2.0.0 in the next week or two anyway. Also, master and 1.0.0 have some significant differences. So if you're trying to compare your code with the two, you're going to have a hard time.\n. Good question... Unfortunately, this is not currently possible, though I wanted it to be #132.\nHowever! I closed #132 because there's a reasonable workaround. From the #132:\n\nThis can be accomplished by specifying a model for the field like so:\njs\n$scope.foobar = {\n  foo: {\n    bar: 'hello'\n  }\n};\n$scope.fields = [{\n  model: $scope.foobar.foo,\n  key: 'bar'\n}];\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"foobar\" fields=\"fields\" />\nThis is supported as of 9f10f57\n\nHopefully that's a reasonable workaround for you!\nIf you want to take a whack at a PR to support 'name.first' that would be way awesome because I think it's a much better api. However, there are some issues with using getter/setters with ng-model-options (which I mention in my egghead lesson on it).\n. One thing that we may consider is simply syncing an internal value with an external value using $watch... This would avoid the use of a getter/setter... But that may not be the right approach...\nP.S. Thanks for angulartics! :D\n. There were big breaking changes from 1.0 to 2.0. But what's in matter\nshould be compatible with 2.0. See the changelog. :-D\n- Kent C.

Would love to see some LumX examples on there :-) https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/edit/master/demo/app/states/root/components/data/examples.js\n. Thanks. Maybe you can provide me with some feedback.\n\nI've been thinking about making a change to the field config api to make things more clear what is for templates and what is for formly core. So changing the api to be this:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'text', // or template/templateUrl\n  key: 'first',\n  wrapper: 'someWrapper', // new api in master, you'll love this one. You may actually want to build your templates with this and wait for me to release this officially. Should be in the next few days. Also, the api is not finished because I'm planning on being able to specify an array where the first wrapper would be wrapped in the second wrapper and so on :-D\n  model: vm.user.name,\n  expressionProperties: {},\n  data: {}, // reserved for users\n  modelOptions: {}, // currently created in formly core, but I'm thinking that we should pull it out and let this be part of the template\n  watcher: {},\n  validators: {}, // this is technically used only in the template using the formly-custom-validation directive. So perhaps it should go in the templateOptions? But I think that all templates that use ng-model should support validators so it may be better just to keep it here.\n  templateOptions: { // and here's the change. All template-specific options would be moved to here\n    label: 'First Name',\n    placeholder: 'Please be honest',\n    required: true,\n    options: [],\n    description: 'Enter your first name so we can know what it is',\n    // etc...\n  }\n}\nWhat do you think? I've presented on formly, and the biggest confusion for people was figuring out what was part of the formly core and what was necessary/supported by the template library. I think this api makes it much more clear. I'm anxious to get your feedback so I can make this change if you think it would be useful. We could then cut a 3.0.0 release. And don't worry, it wont drag on like the 2.0.0 :-) I'm speaking on formly at ng-nl next week, so I'll want to cut a new release before then.\nSo, anyway, I really like this new api. I think it's more clear. Let me know what you think :-)\n. Actually @ShMcK, I still want to keep type. I was just saying that you can still specify a type OR a template OR a templateUrl. With this new paradigm, you would have a templateOptions.type to specify a different type for the input template type.\nI'm working on documenting the wrapper api a little better. It's pretty cool. You can have wrappers in wrappers, which should make ng-messages and labels really handy! It's mostly tested and I'm going to have an example on the site for it as well so you should be able to figure out how to leverage it fairly easily.\nI'm going to leave modelOptions and validators where they are. I think it makes sense to keep them there.\nBut be aware that I am going to move all template configuration to templateOptions and I'm going to throw an error if anyone specifies a property that does not belong in the main configuration. Users will have free reign over both the data and templateOptions objects, but the rest of the field api will be limited to what is explicitly allowed.\nThanks for working with me on this as I try to make this the best forms abstraction for angular :-)\n. Note, I'm also changing setTemplate and setTemplateUrl to simply setType. Keep an eye on the README for that simpler api.\n. I've been having a lot of fun this evening making a bunch of changes. Most of them will simply require you to change from options to options.templateOptions. Also, there are several other nice updates as well (including wrapped wrappers). I recommend taking a look at how I altered the other template libraries (like bootstrap to see what changes you'll need to make. Also check out the changelog.\n. Also, be advised that I've released a beta version of this to npm. You can npm install angular-formly@3.0.0 to see it.\n. Terrific! I want to wait until your library is up to date before releasing the next version to make sure that you're able to go through and double check the api. I want you to let me know if I was just being crazy or something :-)\n. Hi @ShMcK, I'm actually in Sweden right now, but still suffering from jetlag. So sorry I wasn't available earlier. Here are a few things:\n- Hopefully the wrappers will be sufficient to help you avoid repeating yourself\n- options: [] for radio buttons are specific to radio buttons and are not needed at all by formly core. That's the basic premise of everything. If it's not common to all templates (ie, used by formly core) then it belongs in either templateOptions or in data (though data is more reserved for users, not template writers).\n- I thought about using template instead of the more verbose templateOptions. However, template is already in use because you can specify a template instead of a type or templateUrl\n- I'm thinking that perhaps it may be nice to have somehow a way that formly would attach the ng-required, ng-disabled, etc. directives based on the templateOptions automatically for you. But that would require a recompilation of the template which would likely lead to a performance issue. And I believe that formly actually already has poor performance sometimes so I'd like to avoid making it worse. But I think I would like to explore this possibility as it would make the templates MUCH easier to write.\nThanks for your work on this! Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to do. I think I'll look into that last point. If there's a way I can do this without hurting performance, I think I will because that would be great!\n. Excellent! :-)\n- Kent C.

A couple thoughts:\n- On the fm.formFields preview on the right, I would actually make a copy of the fields in your controller and display those. Formly attaches several things to the fields that are not entirely necessary showing (like model options or the form control)\n- Speaking of the form control, if you open your console, you'll notice some warnings complete with links to explanations. Look into those :-)\n\nIt could be that last one is related to the select components not working, but I'm not certain about that...\n. Just playing around with one of those selects, it appeared that it may have just been a css issue. I found the parent element of the dropdown and the opacity was set to 0. I changed it to 1 and everything started working...\n. @abodacs, could you be more specific? They seem to be working for me...\n. Well, I fixed it as much as I could, but the rest is up to jsbin\n. For now, you can click \"load unsafe scripts\" and that'll make things work for mixed https and http.\n\n. @abodacs, so the \"solution\" is to force non-ssl because the jsbin examples will come from the community and I can't force people to upgrade to jsbin pro (which is how you enable ssl for jsbin) so now if you come to the page with https, it will downgrade you to http... :-(\n. @abodacs, I would, except the original issue is still valid. I still want more examples on the site :D Feel free to submit a PR if you have time to create a specific example! :D\n. Thanks for the tip @JamyDev. I think that's a good idea. I'll try to get it in soon.\n. This is now supported: e29ad3dc37e46b9dbab7b05a77185b6396684e63\nNote: This is a breaking change and will result in a 3.0.0 release. I hope this release comes soon. Also note, with this 3.0.0 release comes templateWrappers which you're going to love if you use many custom templates :-)\n. To be more clear, it's going to be shipped with other breaking changes. I think the simple errors thrown wouldn't be a problem necessarily since you couldn't do this in 2.0 anyway, but I've got a bunch of other things that are definitely breaking changes that this will ship with. Should be a much easier migration from 2.0 to 3.0 than it was from 1.0 to 2.0.\n. Absolutely. You simply need to create a custom template and use those directives in your custom template. I'm actually doing this currently with ui-select.\nhtml\n<div class=\"input-group col-md-12\">\n  <div class=\"form-control\"\n       type=\"text\"\n       name=\"{{::id}}\"\n       ng-attr-placeholder=\"{{options.placeholder}}\"\n       ng-required=\"options.required\"\n       formly-custom-validation=\"options.validators\"\n       az-autofocus=\"{{options.focus}}\"\n       ui-select2=\"options.data.select2Options\"\n       ng-model=\"model[options.key || index]\"\n       az-ui-select2-disabled=\"options.disabled\"></div>\n</div>\nThere are likely a few things in there that you'd need to change from my example, but the concept is fairly straightforward :-) Good luck!\n. Also, if you do get this implemented, I would love to have an example on the website. Create an example by following the instructions here\n. @piernik, do we need to keep this issue open?\n. Thanks @metasean! It's been fixed.\n. I've got an idea. What if we gave you something like this:\njavascript\nformlyConfigProvider.templateManipulators.preWrapper.push(function(template, fieldOptions, scope) {\n  // do whatever you want to here and return the template. You can even return a promise\n  // this will be called before all of the wrappers have have run\n});\njavascript\nformlyConfigProvider.templateManipulators.postWrapper.push(function(template, fieldOptions, scope) {\n  // this will be called after all of the wrappers have have run\n});\nWhat do you think about that? I think I sort of like that. Would allow you to add classes or styles or even wrap it further. AND it would allow you to add all the ng- directives we were talking about automagically :-)\n. Saving template code is the main usefulness. But you need to make sure that\nyou're specifying the right types on the wrapper when it's defined or\nspecifying the right wrappers when the type is defined. That may be a bit\nconfusing....\n- Kent C.

Oh yeah, I was going to mention that. After looking at it, I think you definitely need to do this because it adds a few things to your fields that are necessary (including the key if one is not specified, and it adds the watchers). Without the formly-form, you'll miss out on a few things that I think are important.\n. I'm not sure I know what you mean by binding to model[options.key].fields.... The fields should not be on the model at all. I think what you really want is what you have above: fields=\"options.templateOptions.fields\"\n. Is there not a link with that error? There should be a url link to a wiki that explains why you're getting that error and how to fix it. I'm guessing this is the error you're seeing: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/wiki/Errors-and-Warnings#couldnt-set-the-formcontrol-after-timems\n. Basically, if that error is what I believe it is, you need to make sure that all of your ng-model attributes specify a name attribute or that the field config specifies noFormControl: true\n.

We're building something awesome :D\n. @ShMcK you'll want to look at this commit: b02d0a652d956895e092125321196c0aca7969ab see the changes to tests, docs, and examples :-D You could also benefit from looking at these changes in templates bootstrap: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap/commit/1e7d12876318f9dd4406c6ade77de2f61019102b Your life should be much easier now!\n. @gboersma, I'm glad to see you keeping up with what I'm doing with the latest stuff. It helps me get feedback when people try to use stuff that I'm building :-)\n\nThe reason I've decided to create templateOptions (which is such a big breaking change) is because it became confusing to determine what (in the field config object) is used in formly core (ie common regardless of template) and what is used in the template only. By restricting what properties you can put in the field config, it makes formly's api more consistent and easier to use. Also, formly is now able to warn you if you use it incorrectly (currently, it throws an error, but I plan on changing that to a simple warning).\nPlease note! I have a huge application with a LOT of field configurations. I'm not looking forward to updating all of these. So, to ease things a little bit, I just barely created this tool which I hope should be helpful when updating your form fields :-) cheers! http://jsbin.com/ruwoke\n. Oh, sorry, and to answer your actual question, unfortunately I don't think that I'm going to be able to add a backwards compatible option. Hopefully the little tool I created will suffice. I believe it should be everything you need to update your fields to the new standard. If you're using custom templates, that's a bit of a different story. You'll need to update those manually. Good luck!\n. I will not include this logic in formly core, but it should be very reasonable to do yourself before you pass the options to formly. Depending on how things are set up for you, it may be easiest to use an http interceptor and do the conversion there. Obviously, this wouldn't allow you to keep your templates as they are. But it is likely that the template update bit is just a half hour change max.\nAs for the actual conversion function, because you're just dealing with json (rather than having to worry about functions) then something like this should probably do it:\n``` javascript\n// test fields using the old method\nvar oldFields = [\n  {\n    label: 'Field 1',\n    required: true,\n    key: 'field1',\n    type: 'text',\n    expressionProperties: {\n      data: {\n        dataProp1: '$viewValue.length > 4'\n      },\n      hide: 'model.field2',\n      disabled: '!model.field3'\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    label: 'Field 2',\n    key: 'field2',\n    type: 'checkbox'\n  },\n  {\n    label: 'Field 3',\n    key: 'field3',\n    type: 'checkbox'\n  }\n];\nconsole.log('before', oldFields);\nvar newFields = convert(oldFields);\nconsole.log('after', newFields);\n// here's the actual convert function\nfunction convert(fields) {\n  var copy = fields;\n  var allowedProperties = [\n    'type', 'template', 'templateUrl', 'key', 'model',\n    'expressionProperties', 'data', 'templateOptions',\n    'wrapper', 'modelOptions', 'watcher', 'validators',\n    'noFormControl', 'hide'\n  ];\n  angular.forEach(copy, function(field) {\n    angular.forEach(field, function(val, prop) {\n      if (prop === 'expressionProperties') {\n        for (var eProp in val) {\n          if (allowedProperties.indexOf(eProp) === -1) {\n            val['templateOptions.' + eProp] = val[eProp];\n            delete val[eProp];\n          }\n        }\n        if (val.data) {\n          for (var dProp in val.data) {\n            val['data.' + dProp] = val.data[dProp];\n          }\n          delete val.data;\n        }\n      }\n      if (allowedProperties.indexOf(prop) !== -1) {\n        return;\n      }\n      field.templateOptions = field.templateOptions || {};\n      field.templateOptions[prop] = val;\n      delete field[prop];\n    });\n  });\n  return copy;\n}\n```\n. @gboersma, do you think this will be sufficient? Do we need to keep this issue open?\n. Thanks for being flexible. I'm trying to make this project the very best that it can be and that required a few breaking changes.

Could you jump on Gitter really quick?\n. Do we need to keep this open?\n. Created a repo for this. Closing in favor of that: https://github.com/formly-js/formly-builder/issues/1\n. Formly doesn\u2019t wrap every formly-field in an ng-form, but it does wrap every formly-form in an ng-form is that what you\u2019re talking about? If you'd like to skip the ng-form, then I think this is doable. Especially because we're using es6 template strings it should be a breeze. I'll just have to move the template from a file to a function and allow you to specify an attribute that says that you don't want it in an ng-form. Should be very easy.\n. The api would probably be something like this:\n\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"vm.model\" fields=\"vm.fields\" form=\"vm.form\" no-ng-form></formly-form>\nThough, thinking about it now, I'm not sure why the presence of ng-form prevents rows/columns. Can't you just style the ng-form? You can add your own classes to the formly-form and it will be applied to the ng-form.\n. Closed with 3.0.3 208b851ebe886dd61c9311db08244bb330a91ce3\n. This is supported in version 5.2.0-beta.1. Thinking this will likely land. Here's an example\n. This is supported as of 5.2.0 :-)\n. Thanks @juristr!\n. That's not a common use case, but one way to accomplish this would be via the watcher. You might do something like this:\njavascript\nwatcher: {\n  expression: 'options.hide',\n  listener: function(field, newVal, oldVal, scope) {\n    if (newVal) {\n      scope.fields.splice(scope.fields.indexOf(field), 1); // removes the field itself\n      delete scope.model[field.key]; // removes the field from the model\n    }\n  }\n}\nI don't totally understand your use case, but doing this seems very odd to me and I would suggest finding another way to accomplish what you're trying to do.\n. Ah, I see, so you don't actually want to delete the property, you just want to change the value of the model. Well, the best way to accomplish this is likely still with a watcher but don't actually remove the field or use delete. Just set the value to null or an empty string. This is an edge case because the form's purpose is to represent the current state of the model, not alter it specifically. But if you wish to do this, I'd use watcher. Let me know if you have additional questions :-)\n. Oh, and please close this issue if you have it working and you're happy with the solution.\n. I'm not sure what you need more than this example for the template wrappers. I just added a new example for custom controller and link functions. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!\n. I believe you could specify the name of the controller as a sting as long\nas it's been registered with angular and it should work.

Dear @ShMcK, you rock. Thanks for being an awesome OSS contributor! Or, as @aaronfrost would say: a \"bridge builder\" :-D\n. @stefanzweifel, let me know if there's anything that could be changed about the core library to make this process easier. I agree that this is a common thing many people will want to do, so I want to make it as easy as it can be without complicating the API.\n\nAlso, I would totally love for a team like yours who's doing Foundation work to own the Foundation Templates :D\n. So, I've been thinking about this a little bit, what would you think of an api like this:\njavascript\nvm.formFields = [\n  { /* field config */ },\n  [\n    { /* field config */ },\n    { /* field config */ },\n    { /* field config */ }\n  ],\n  { /* field config */ },\n  { /* field config */ },\n  [\n    { /* field config */ },\n    { /* field config */ }\n  ],\n  { /* field config */ }\n];\nAnd then you pass the vm.formFields as the fields attribute on formly-form and formly-form would somehow logically group those together for you. I'm not sure how this would best be accomplished. But I like to work \"backward\" and consider the desired api first, then come up with a solution (I guess that's sort of the TDD style). Would this be an acceptable API?\n. I'm wondering what this would actually result in. Right now, formly-form just uses ng-repeat on the fields so they wind up being siblings of one another. I'm thinking that with this array approach, it might group them into a div with a class like formly-field-group or something. Do you think this would really solve the problem?\n. > it adds complexity to the implementation. Which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.\n:+1: to that @GuilhermeMedeiros. I think I may have misunderstood your other comment. But I think that formly can do a little more work for you and I don't think that adding the ability to specify fields as an array of grouped fields would complicate the implementation too much. But I'm still uncertain of whether this will actually solve the problem. Perhaps the issue in my understanding is that where I'm using formly, the label is on the left rather than on top, so putting fields in a grid layout doesn't make as much sense for me.\n. @GuilhermeMedeiros, I'm not certain that I understand what you're suggesting. If I understand it correctly, it feels like a bit of a more complicated API. Also, what you suggested with the formly-field is sort of possible because the formly-field directive exists (you simply need to provide the proper attributes). Anyway, I'm sorry if I'm having a hard time understanding what you're suggesting. Thanks for your patience.\n. Thanks @GuilhermeMedeiros! I would really appreciate any help you can give on implementing this functionality. Reach out to me when you think you've got time!\n. @stefanzweifel, perhaps. The thing is that there are a few \"right\" ways to do this I think which makes it difficult to decide which is the real \"right\" way.\n. So, looking for feedback. I'm guessing that the vote right now is to create a separate repository/module for this. There are actual several directives in the angular-formly module that could go into this category I think. Do you think that we should create a new repo called angular-formly-template-utils and use that for all of these utility directives? I'm also thinking that it may just be easier to stick in the formly-area directive into formly proper. I'm sort of torn and not certain of the best approach for this.\n. I've created an example of how to accomplish this on the website. I think that will have to be sufficient for now.\n.

Closed, thanks to @raibutera!\n. No, you're fine. angular-formly depends on at LEAST Angular 1.2.x, but if you have a newer version that's terrific! You just need to specify a resolution.

Here's a fixed example.\n\nI realize that this is only a small example, but I think the problem in your actual repository is that you're not actually specifying a controller in your state definition. You should add a controller: 'formController' to this line.\n. It sounds like you're having problems with UI router. I'm not certain how to help you. Let me know if you have specific questions.

Oh, ok. Do you need to reopen this issue then?\n. Thanks @jameswyse, I actually video chatted with Victor a little bit to talk about the formly api and I would like to think that had some sway on the decision to include a more imperative approach. Hoping that angular-formly will be rendered useless by Angular 2. However, my plan is to make the port anyway so people can upgrade to Angular 2 without the need to change their form configurations. Then they can migrate from angular-formly to Angular 2's built-in stuff.\n. Created the formly-js/angular2-formly repo. It's pretty rough, but I'm closing this issue in favor of that.

Not currently. I could pretty easily add an api like this:\n\njavascript\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'input',\n  validateOptions: function(options) {\n    // validate your stuff here, throw your own errors or log your own warnings\n  }\n});\nWith that, you could do something like this:\n``` javascript\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'input',\n  validateOptions: function(options) {\n    var templateOptionsCheck = apiCheck.shape({\n      label: apiCheck.string,\n      placeholder: apiCheck\n    });\n    templateOptionsCheck.strict = true; // must have all and no more than specified stuff\napiCheck.throw(apiCheck.shape({\n  templateOptions: templateOptionsCheck,\n  data: apiCheck.shape({\n    someProperty: apiCheck.any\n  })\n}, arguments);\n\n}\n});\n```\nOr you could roll your own api check stuff. What do you think?\n. So, in this scenario, formly doesn't actually care what you do. It simply passes you options and allows you to throw or warn or alert or whatever the heck you want. In my example, I'm using apiCheck.throw which will throw an error if the checks fail. I'm passing arguments because that's the api to apiCheck (the first argument is your check function and the second argument expects you to pass arguments) so it actually is using options though not explicitly as a variable.\nI suppose that formly could take a more opinionated approach, but I fear this would reduce flexibility.\n. Ok, the api should be pretty simple to setup. I think I'm going to make apiCheck a dependency of formly, and when that happens, you'll be able to use apiCheck by default because you depend on formly, so you'll get apiCheck. I'll make apiCheck injectable as well so you'll be able to simply inject it and not worry about where it came from :-)\n. Oh, by the way, this is supported as of 3.3.0 :-)\n. formly uses apiCheck internally to validate its own apis (like setType). So if you're seeing that it's because you're calling setType wrong or there's a problem with the apiCheck config for that function. I actually have a bunch of stuff locally around that stuff. If you can hold off for a day or so, I'll get it in and then you can play with it :-)\n. I think it'd be more like this:\njavascript\nFIELDS.map(function (field) {\n        formlyConfig.setType({\n          name: _prefixer(field.name),\n          templateUrl: _fieldTemplateUrl(field.name),\n          validateOptions: field.validateOptions || function (options) {\n            apiCheck.throw(apiCheck.object, arguments);  // <--- validateOptions key\n          }\n        });\n      });\n. I can see where what you're suggesting would be beneficial. Maybe that can be a feature added a little later down the line. Right now, you're responsible for throwing your own error or logging your own warnings.\n. There's an example for this now: http://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/#/example/custom-types/validate-options\n. Does this still need to be open?\n.

The line of code that browserify is looks at  (dist/formly.js which is the main in the package.json) actually looks like this:\n\njavascript\nformlyConfig.tests = false ? require('./formlyConfig.test')(ngModule) : null;\nThis is because I'm using webpack's DefinePlugin which will set that value to false when it compiles.\nThe error is coming from browserify trying to resolve that require statement, whereas the browser would never run that require statement, and when webpack builds, it's smart enough to know to not resolve it.\nSo the best solution (IMO) would be to figure out a way to configure browserify to not attempt to resolve that require statement.\n. @sgimeno, could you try this solution to see if it will work for you: https://github.com/zertosh/unreachable-branch-transform\n. Did that solution work for people? Does this still need to be open?\n. Closing this issue as there hasn't been any activity on it for a while. Please reopen if this is an issue in the future.\n. Wow @pmowrer, thanks for putting effort into getting this to work with browserify. I'm sorry that it's such a pain! Do you think you'd have a problem with simply using the minified file? That wont have the line that's causing the root issue here. I don't think you'd get sourcemaps for angular-formly, but hopefully that wont be a problem most of the time.\n. Closing this as it should be fixed in 6.0.0\n. I actually had a conversation with @mzabriskie about this the other day. He informed me that including sourcemaps in your dist is actually a bad idea for this very reason I believe. I think that I'll have to find another way to accomplish the good development experience (perhaps a different distributable file?) For now, you could point to the minified version which doesn't include sourcemaps. Thanks!\n. Yeah, I think that it's because I'm including sourcemaps. I'll try to pull those out in the next version (soon to be released)\n. Might have fixed this. Everyone who's using browserify, please do:\nnpm install api-check@7.2.3-beta.0\nnpm install angular-formly@6.4.2-beta.0\nRe-opening until someone tells me this fixes their problem. Please let me know asap :-)\n. Fixed and officially released in 6.4.2 :-) You're welcome :-)\n. Could you verify that this works as well (it should):\njavascript\nvar angular = require('angular');\nvar app = angular.module('anAppThatCanFinallyUseFormly', [require('angular-formly')]);\n. Note the edit: You shouldn't have to even require api-check because angular-formly will require it itself.\n. Here's the final steps (I'll put into the docs if someone tells me this works):\n1. install api-check and angular-formly via npm (NOT BOWER)\n   - npm install api-check 7.2.3 angular-formly 6.4.2 --save\n   - NB: No browserify shim or dependency listing in your package.json's browserify configuration object is necessary.\n2. in your javascript, require angular-formly in your module's dependencies array\njavascript\nvar angular = require('angular');\nvar app = angular.module('anAppThatCanFinallyUseFormly', [require('angular-formly')]);\n. My most sincere apologies @jameswyse. I just added apiCheck, so I wonder if you could give me feedback on it. How difficult was it to work with before you realized that you needed to make a bug? The whole purpose of apiCheck is to help you learn how to use the api. Unfortunately, the way I defined the api for this piece was wrong and that's where the bug comes from (I said it was a function, but it is actually an object of functions).\nAnyway, I'd love feedback on that. Thanks!\n. Oh, also, npm|bower install 3.3.2 :-)\n. Thanks @jameswyse. That's very... for lack of a better word... validating :-)\nSo, I just updated the Custom Validators example on the website to show an example of how to alter the default message using validation.messages. It actually heavily depends on how you implement ng-messages in your templates. If you do it like the example demonstrates, then you're invoking the messages.\nAlso note, that the example has also been updated to demonstrate the use of the formlyValidationMessages factory which may be of use to you as well :-) Let me know if you need any more help.\n. Very interesting. How are you creating your type? Here's the entire setType function:\njavascript\nfunction setType(options) {\n      if (angular.isArray(options)) {\n        angular.forEach(options, setType);\n      } else if (angular.isObject(options)) {\n        checkType(options); // <-- at this point, the options you pass are validated using apiCheck, so the name is definitely defined and a string here.\n        if (options.extends) {\n          extendTypeOptions(options); // <-- if you're extending then options runs through this function, but nothing happens to the `name` property\n        }\n        typeMap[options.name] = options; // <-- we're putting the `options.name` here.\n      } else {\n        throw getError(`You must provide an object or array for setType. You provided: ${JSON.stringify(arguments)}`);\n      }\n    }\nThat function should be using apiCheck before long, but anyway, I think you get the idea. My first place to check (and step through the code) would be in the setType function.\n. Are you still experiencing this issue?\n. Fantastic! :D\n. Hi @delaman, we actually use swagger at @alianza-dev as well. It's way cool. However, we don't generate forms based on it.\nI don't think that this belongs in angular-formly core. This would go very nicely as a formly-js library though. All that you would need is a function that converts the JSON from swagger into properly formatted fields. You could look at this example of how I did this to help upgrade people from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 or modify the code of this tool to make it work and turn it into a library. It should hopefully be fairly trivial.\nHowever, as I said, this is not something that belongs in angular-formly core. If you're interested, I could create a repo in the formly-js organization and give you commit access so you could build and open source such a tool. Let me know.\n. You're right, but you don't have to use ES6 if you don't want to. However\nyou want to code. Formly supports ES5.\n- Kent C.

Looks like another browserify issue consuming webpack generated code. Dah! This is super frustrating. What if you require the minified version? require('angular-formly/dist/formly.min.js')\n. I'm not sure how this could happen. Could you look at the source and make sure this line still exists: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/dist/formly.js#L18 and make sure that it's passed to all the modules. This is a very odd issue. I feel like if the script runs in the browser but not with your tool, then the bug is with your tool, not the library... But I'd like to do whatever I need to help this work for you guys.\n. I would like you to be able to use angular-formly on your new project too! Let me know what I can do to help.\n. @ShMcK, did you get it working? Does this issue need to remain open?\n. Ok, please let me know if there's anything that I can do on my end to make this work. Good luck!\n. It looks like you're creating the type properly. Could you paste your template?\n. Also, you don't happen to be here at ng-conf right now are you? If so we could meet up and I could help you in person.\n. So, with angular-formly, the template has access to some specific things. The scope of your template is not the same as the scope in your controller. So, anything you want your template to have access to needs to be in your field configuration under templateOptions. So you'd want to do something like this:\n\njavascript\n$scope.fields = [\n  {\n    type: 'date', // <-- the name of the type you created for the date-picker\n    key: 'selectedDate', // <-- the property on the model to bind to the value of the date-picker\n    templateOptions: {\n      dateOptions: {}, // <-- your date options\n      formate: '', // <-- your format\n      ... // <-- the other things you want to have access to in your template\n    }\n  }\n];\nThen you need to reference the options object in your template. Most of your stuff will be on options.templateOptions, but because this is a lot to type, formly gives you a shortcut called to.\nhtml\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" datepicker-popup=\"{{to.format}}\" ng-model=\"model[options.key]\" is-open=\"opened\" min-date=\"to.minDate\" max-date=\"to.maxDate'\" datepicker-options=\"to.dateOptions\" date-disabled=\"to.disabled(date, mode)\" close-text=\"{{to.closeText || 'Close'}}\" />\nNote: You don't need to specify ng-required because angular formly will add that for you automatically if you specify required as one of your template options.\nIf you need more help, take a look at this example and this talk\n. You're welcome @abodacs :-)\n. This is how angular treats models that are invalid. If you want to override this behavior then you can use modelOptions (only if you're using angular 1.3 or greater). Otherwise you'll have to use the $viewValue. Here's an example of using modelOptions: http://jsbin.com/zuqojo Let me know if this solves your issue.\n. Hi @paulvanbladel,\nBoth of these would require a custom type. There's an example of how to do this on the website. For the custom action, your type could specify a controller which would add the custom action to the $scope (here's an example of that).\n. Hi @paulvanbladel! Did you get this working? Does this need to remain open? Or can I help you out with anything?\n. I take it you got this working? Great! :D Let me know if there's anything more I can do!\n. @abodacs, an autocomplete component is pretty complex. There are libraries that allow you to do it pretty easily. Is there a particular library you'd like to see an example of integration with formly?\n. > and it would be great if it was in edit mode.\nI'm not sure what you mean by this...\n.

You just need to make sure that you're setting options to the right thing...\n. So, currently formlyBootstrap's select type doesn't support selecting the entire object as the model value. Feel free to submit a PR to support this or simply create your own select type (it's very easy to do).\nAs far as that array, I have no idea where that's coming from. If you look at the examples, that's not what is happening. Could you create a jsbin that reproduces the issue?\n. Everything you have here looks fine (pretty much a copy/paste of my example in many areas which is great). What does the DOM look like where the form should be?\n. Ah, your KeyRequestController is defined using controllerAs syntax (you're referencing this) but in your route, you're not specifying controllerAs: 'vm'. Simply add that to the route definition and you should be good :-)\n. What is the value of vm.locations after the request finishes? Also, it's best practice to not use $http in your controller. You should either use resolve in your route definition and/or use a service. If you resolve your dependencies into your controller, then this issue goes away entirely.\n. Hmmm...

Thanks @remy!\n. Thanks for the update @jesperronn :-) I've updated my comment.\n. Definitely useful. formlyBootstrap doesn't support this currently. I definitely recommend that you create your own type for select because you obviously have some extra use cases that it's not supporting now. I recommend that everyone create their own types anyway. I've done this and I'll put that below. Maybe it will be instructive (note, it's written in ES6)\njavascript\nexport default ngModule => {\n  const template =\n    `<select ng-model=\"model[options.key]\" class=\"form-control\">\n      <option ng-if=\"!to.notNull\" value=\"\"></option>\n    </select>`;\n  ngModule.run((formlyConfig) => {\n    formlyConfig.setType({\n      name: 'select',\n      extends: 'azBase',\n      template,\n      defaultOptions(options) {\n        const forWithFilter = `for item in to.options | azDynamicFilter:to.filter:to.orderBy`;\n        let ngOptions = `item[to.valueProp] as item[to.displayProp || 'name'] ${forWithFilter}`;\n        const {valueProp, displayProp, options: items} = options.templateOptions;\n        if (items && typeof items[0] === 'string') {\n          ngOptions = `item for item in to.options | azDynamicFilter:to.filter:'toString()'`;\n        } else if (valueProp === null && displayProp) {\n          ngOptions = `item as item[to.displayProp] ${forWithFilter}`;\n        }\n        return {\n          ngModelAttrs: {\n            [ngOptions]: {\n              value: 'ng-options'\n            }\n          },\n          templateOptions: {\n            filter: 'orderBy',\n            orderBy: 'name',\n            displayProp: 'name',\n            valueProp: 'value'\n          }\n        };\n      }\n    });\n  });\n};\n. If you want to add support for this in formlyBootstrap, please feel free to do so! I'm closing this issue though because this is not the formlyBootstrap repo.\n. Here's an example of how to do that :-)\nhttp://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/#/example/other/disable-submit-button\nLet me know if you have any other questions :-)\n. Terrific question. The problem is that the options.formControl gets set in the controller function which will only run once and then never again. The problem comes with the ng-if which rips the input field out of the DOM. If the field starts in the read only state then you'll get this warning because the field is not part of the form's formControls. If you set noFormControl then that will get rid of the warning, however the options.formControl will never be set and you wont be able to show validation errors, etc.\nHowever! Angular will watch for when a new form control enters the DOM (when an ng-if evaluates to true and has an ng-model in it for example). So, what we can do is watch the form's property for the form control and add it to the scope/options ourselves! Yay!\nHere's an updated working example :-) Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!\nhttp://jsbin.com/tinoxo/edit?html,js,output\n. By the way, I'm going to add this to our examples if that's ok with you. In the middle of making some updates to the website, but once that's done this will be part of the examples :-)\n. Closing this for now. Please feel free to reopen if I didn't answer your question :-)\n. This was just a test of issuetemplate :-)\n. Hi @maryampashmi! You simply need to include the apiCheck script on the page. If you're using script tags, make sure to add the one for apiCheck:\nhtml\n<script src=\"bower_components/api-check/dist/apiCheck.min.js\"></script>\n. Make sure that this script tag is BEFORE angular-formly.\n. You're very welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n. Yes, unfortunately this will currently not work. The watcher property is unique in that it is utilized in the formly-form directive, not the formly-field directive. The reason for this is that it allows your watcher to be active even if the field is hidden. However, because the multiField is iterating over the nested fields without using the formly-form (which it must to accomplish the advanced layout) so it is not able to take advantage of that property (sad day).\nHowever, I rarely use the watcher property in my own stuff at work because there's normally an easier/better way to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish. For example, in your templateOptions you can specify an onChange which will add an ng-change to your ng-model element. This may work just as well for what you're going for.\nIf that doesn't work for you, you can always specify a controller or a link for the field and do the watch there. Again, this wont be operative when the field is hidden... So you could get creative and make a field that has a template of template: '' and that has a controller or link. But that's a little crazy and I would be surprised if you needed to resort to this...\nFinally, there's always just adding the $scope.$watch in your own controller. Not awesome from a reusability standpoint, but that's an option.\nLet me know if you need any help with your specific use case.\n. You're welcome!\n. angular-formly is built entirely with webpack in mind. It would be significant effort to remove the webpack dependency. I'm curious to know why you have a problem how it's built...\n. I see what you mean. However, I think you've misunderstood. Even though angular-formly is built with Webpack, it's distributed using UMD, which supports AMD, CommonJS, and globals. For example, all the examples on the website are using basic script tags, so angular-formly will expose itself as a global in that case.\nPlease do some additional research to let me know why it didn't just work for you and I'll see what I can do to help.\n. I'm going to go ahead and just close this. Let me know if you still have issues with this.\n. Looks good. Thanks for your work on this! The one thing that I'll say is that you'll definitely need polyfills for things like map, and forEach, etc. But if you say that this is working for you in IE8, then that's awesome. I'll get this merged as soon as I'm able!\n. @koenweyn, you've guessed right :-)\n. @koenweyn, seriously, thank you for working on this. I really appreciate the help! I hope it's worth it for you!\n. Me too! Were you there?! Did I meet you?\n. Thanks for being a good bridge crosser/builder! :D\n. Definitely :D\n. Hey @koenweyn, I'm writing a blogpost that references this PR. Do you mind if I reference you in it? https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/78281ea47455\n. Thanks @rbfinch! Glad that you've found it useful. First, I should say that validators functions can return promises, so you could technically make a call to the server in your validator function. Would that solve your use case?\n. Sorry @rbfinch, I don't have time right now to look into this, and I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but I'll leave this issue open and try to get to looking at a better way later. I think I need a mailing list for people to help each other with stuff like this.\n. Mailing list? Fancy that! https://groups.io/org/groupsio/formly-js :+1:\n. @rbfinch, I do something similar. Do you think that there's something that angular-formly could do to make this easier for you? Seems like a reasonable use case that formly may be able to make easier.\n. @rbfinch, I'm going to go ahead and close this now. If your concern hasn't been resolved, please open it up again and we can chat :-)\n. Looking at that blogpost this is totally possible and would actually be easier with angular-formly. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time right now to create an example for you. Perhaps someone on the @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read teams could help out...\n. Cool!

E.g. by\nallowing to specify a \"externalErrors\" object on the directive which in the\nend is nothing different than your \"{ errors: [{ message: 'Unknown error'\n}]};\" object. :-|\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/212#issuecomment-152347864\n.\n\n\nKent C. Dodds https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\n. Thanks!\n. Oh man, I'm in love with this. THANK YOU!!!\n. @raibutera, it looks like the shadow got cut off on the top and bottom if these images. Is there any way you could update the logo so the shading isn't cut off?\n\n\n\n. Thanks a ton :D\n. Good point... So there are two options here. You can either setup the watcher yourself, which may not be a bad idea, or you could use ng-hide instead of ng-if. That comes with its own set of issues. What do you think?\n. @rbfinch, do you think this is acceptable or should we work on researching a better solution?\n. @rbfinch, good news! I totally forgot that I did this, but I changed the way that the formControl gets added to the options based on this use case. It now uses a $watch and will add the formControl after the fact. The example has been updated to use the latest version and shows that this works :-) http://jsbin.com/tinoxo/edit\nPlease re-open this issue if you still have problems.\n. @koenweyn, you're awesome. This is a terrific PR. One thing that could make it even better is a section about browser support in the README (and a note about the need to include polyfills). Do you think you could add this? Thank you!\n. You just commit and push to your branch. It'll get added automagically :-)\n. @koenweyn, GitHub has been experiencing a DDoS attack for the last day and a half (are people insane?) so I think this is why Travis has been having trouble.\n. Thank you so much!\n. This has been released as part of 4.2.1 (had trouble with 4.2.0) :-) Thanks!\n. Hi @Zjaaspoer! Thank you for your kind words!\nThe first thing I would check on is, are you using jQuery? Due to this bug in jqLite, you'll get this issue. The bug was fixed in the latest beta version of 1.4\nNot sure about any other workaround other than including jQuery :-( If you can find one, then that's awesome. But I think that's the problem you're experiencing. Sorry, debugging angular apps in codepen is a pain, which is why I prefer jsbin :-)\n. I totally agree with you, and think that you should wait for 1.4 to come out, rather than including jQuery (I think I have the same personal opinions). However, the project that I inherited was riddled with jQuery plugins, so I didn't experience this problem until I made the demo that you saw at ng-nl which is when I reported that bug.  :-) enjoy your beverage. I'm going to be sticking with water :-) cheers!\n. Just recorded 4 lessons. Should be up on egghead.io soon! :D\n. You'll see one of the new egghead.io lessons has been published :-) You'll find all (2) of the lessons on the documentation website enjoy!\n. P.S. More to come :-)\n. Another lesson is up! http://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/learn-angular-formly\n. Hey everyone! There are now 8 lessons on the egghead.io playlist and the Learn angular-formly page. Please let me know if there are specific topics you want to know about. Right now I'm using analytics to know which lessons to record next, but it's starting to get pretty even now. Squeaky wheel gets the grease!\n. Going to go ahead and close this, but feel free to keep asking for lessons on specific subjects. I'm still listening :-)\n. Hi @DevanB, I'm no longer doing anything with angular-formly, so it's very unlikely that I'll make any more egghead.io lessons about it. Good luck.. Thanks! :D\n. If I understand your issue correctly, this is by design. If you wish it to show errors, you can set validation.show to true, like so: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/force-show-error\n. I'm going to close this now. Please re-open it if this doesn't solve your issue or if you have further questions.\n. I'm sorry @cdbizone. I really have no idea what your issue is... Please be more specific about the issue that you're experiencing. From what I can tell, everything is working as designed...\n. Oh, so if you can hide the iframe based on the $valid property of the form. This is similar to how you would disable a submit button (except you'd use ng-if instead of ng-disable). Does that answer your question?\n. Ok, I understand what you're talking about now. So this is what I would do: http://jsbin.com/fivuqa/edit\n. Yeah, just barely noticed this too! I broke this in 5.0.0. Fixing now!\n. Thanks for creating the issue. I was just about to create one so I could reference it in my commit. Should be about 10 minutes or so before I have the fix released. Thanks for your patience!\n. Released! Thanks!\n. It's 5.0.1\n. Uh oh... Yeah, totally still broken\n. Give me a second... My test wasn't correct.\n. @ValentinH, thank you for your patience! This was pretty irresponsible of me. I promise this is not normal :-)\n. Ok, it's fixed for real in 5.0.2. Once rawgit's cache is updated, all the examples should be fixed. You can npm install angular-formly or bower install angular-formly (you may need to clear your cache)\n. Thank you for YOUR reactiveness in reporting the issue :-) Great! Please let me know if you need any help!\n. Thanks for letting me know. I'm working on a fix. Duplicate of #222.\n. FYI, this is fixed as of 5.0.2. Thanks for your patience!\n. Thanks! Let me know if you need any additional help!\n. Don't have time to explain, but angular-formly doesn't do well when you swap out the fields after it has rendered the form. I think that's what you're doing...\n. I'm thinking that #225 is what you're actually interested in doing, so I'm going to close this one.\n. Yeah, because it's invalid, it technically doesn't have a value, so angular wont update the $viewValue. This is an angular problem. You may just have to update the $viewValue yourself :-(\n. Great question... #168 is wondering about supporting this in the core... I think it may be nice. Basically it would require making a copy of the model on first render, then exposing some kind of function (probably on options) that could be called to reset the model to its original state. Would have to handle the model property of fields as well... Do you think that angular-formly is the right place to do that?\n. Alright, I think I've got this fixed. If you could please try this out, that would be great. I've made a beta release that has this feature. Please let me know if this fixes the issue for you. npm install angular-formly@5.2.0-beta.1\n. Sorry, should have given an example or docs. Here you go!\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/form-options/reset-model\n. Ok, that's good to know. It shouldn't break if your model is null. I'll fix that. resetModel shouldn't impact the actual field itself. That wouldn't make sense in the api. And I was thinking about adding a resetFields method, but I don't think that would really make sense either...\nLet me fix the null problem and then I think we're good to release this officially. What do you think?\n. There you go. Officially in 5.2.0!\n. Update, use 5.2.1 instead...\n. @SagiMedina, this is being tracked in #246. Unfortunately it's not as easy as you might think...\n. I think that you could very easily combine angular-formly with angular-wizard. Let me see if I can make an example sometime. Or, if you want to, feel free to try making one yourself\n. Added an example of integrating this with angular-wizard by @mgonto: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/angular-wizard\nI think that's the best we can do right now.\n. This looks awesome! Thanks for the contribution!\n. Still accepting new submissions! But it's on the angular-formly-website repo and I want to clean up these issues.\n. :+1: \n. ping @mikeerickson :-) weekend project? ;-)\n. ping? :-)\n. :P, I'll stop bugging you about it.

That'd be an awesome addition to the library.\n. Maybe this weekend @mikeerickson? :-)\n. I'm cleaning up issues and it doesn't look like this one's going to happen. Feel free to prove me wrong!\n. angular-formly does a lot of stuff to render your fields and it doesn't to great when you modify the fields after the initial compile (as @ValentinH has discovered as well). I'm starting to think that modifying fields order/entirely after compile may be something I need to look at supporting better.\n\nFor now though, perhaps you could describe what you're trying to accomplish and I can give you a useful work around.\n. That sounds awesome! Would you like to build this? I would totally love that!\nFor your case, I think you may just want to recompile things every time you change something. Take a look at kcd-recompile\n. The problem is that some templates use singly bound expressions (like ::to.label) for example. So with those, you HAVE to recompile the entire template. So kcd-recompile should help you with that.\n. I would do something like:\nhtml\n<div kcd-recompile=\"newFormClone\">\n  <formly-form model=\"newFormData\" fields=\"newFormClone\">\n    <button ng-hide=\"newForm.length==0\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" ng-    click=\"onSubmit()\">Submit</button>\n  </formly-form>\n</div>\nThen I would alter kcd-recompile to use a deep watch.\n``` js\nangular.module('kcd.directives').directive('kcdRecompile', function($compile, $parse) {\n  'use strict';\n  return {\n    scope: true, // required to be able to clear watchers safely\n    compile: function(el) {\n      var template = getElementAsHtml(el);\n      return function link(scope, $el, attrs) {\n        var stopWatching = scope.$parent.$watch(attrs.kcdRecompile, function(_new, _old) {\n          var useBoolean = attrs.hasOwnProperty('useBoolean');\n          if ((useBoolean && (!_new || _new === 'false')) || (!useBoolean && (!_new || _new === _old))) {\n            return;\n          }\n          // reset kcdRecompile to false if we're using a boolean\n          if (useBoolean) {\n            $parse(attrs.kcdRecompile).assign(scope.$parent, false);\n          }\n      // recompile\n      var newEl = $compile(template)(scope.$parent);\n      $el.replaceWith(newEl);\n\n      // Destroy old scope, reassign new scope.\n      stopWatching();\n      scope.$destroy();\n    }, true); // <-- that\n  };\n}\n\n};\nfunction getElementAsHtml(el) {\n    return angular.element('').append(el.clone()).html();\n  }\n});\n``\n. This worked \"like a charm\" for @joezhouOxford in https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/246#issuecomment-95852663 so I'm going to close this issue. Let me know if there are further questions\n. I didn't realize that 1.2 didn't support$touched`. Nice catch. Thanks! I like the second recommendation. Would love the PR :-)\n. Thanks for the PR, but I neglected to merge it before I made some changes that made it difficult to merge (my bad!). Sorry about that! Thanks for providing the answer! This is now supported in 5.1.1\n. The docs are available for me...\n\n. @pmowrer, thanks for the issue. I had intended on fixing this because I was upgrading my own app to the beta versions, but I forgot. I'll have this fixed shortly.\n.

Ok, this and several other things (see the changelog) have been changed in angular-formly 6.0.0-beta.2. If you could please try this out, that would be great. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Missed that.

Thanks for letting me know. apiCheck just had a breaking change and I forgot that all the examples run off of master. I'll go fix those now!\n. Fixed. Thanks again! I really need to develop a better way to keep all of the examples dependencies in one place. It may be nice to have them all run on the latest stable version somehow...\n. :smiley: haha! which talk did you see?\n. Haha! The exercise lives on! Thanks for using angular-formly. Please let me know if you have any other needs!\n. The expressionProperties are formlyExpressions. See the docs here: http://docs.angular-formly.com/v5.2.1/docs/formly-expressions\n. Let me know if you need more assistance :-)\n. @hmendezm, the best way to get help is to create an example using http://help.angular-formly.com. Just looking at your code, it appears that it should work fine. So an example is more helpful.\n. Wait, so are you trying to do this?\n. Ah, maybe this will point you in the right direction: http://jsbin.com/yubato/edit?js,output\n. Yes, this is totally possible! And I recommend doing things this way too! :-) Personally, I use the data property for the parameters, but you can do it however you like. You'll use defaultOptions which can be an object or function. Here's an example.\n\nPlease reopen this issue if you need more help.\n. It's loading fine for me. But you're not the first one to mention issues today. I wonder if iwantmyname.com is experiencing issues... Can you look at the network tab and see if there are DNS issues?\n. Wait, just to confirm. For you, the site is actually working, but the embedded examples are failing, is that right?\n. Ok, then it sounds like your computer is having difficulty with jsbin... This could be the result of a few issues. Perhaps your IP address has been blacklisted (that's happened to me before). ping @remy\n. Thanks for telling me about the view which excludes whitespace. Otherwise I would have looked at this and just been like: \"dude, there's no way I can review this thing... sorry\" haha.\nI actually really like it. Though I really like to require my test inside the file that I'm testing, I think for a small project like this, it's not really that big of a deal. It should also resolve #186 which is a plus.\nIf you could make the few updates I mentioned, I'll pull it down and double check everything, then I'll make this part of the official 6.0.0 release. Thanks!\n. Thank you for the PR! I think this is going to be a good change.\n. I found a few jshint issues. Also, when minified, ng-annotate doesn't annotate the functions properly. Could you add the @ngInject annotation to the injectable functions please? Then I think we'll be good to merge this in! Thanks!\n. I rebased these changes locally and pushed! These changes are live in 6.0.0-beta.8! Thanks a ton!\n. The problem is that angular-formly does a lot of things to your fields at compile time. If you reassign the fields after the form has been compiled, then that will cause a problem for you (as you can see).\nSo, instead of changing the fields, create another formly-form that will receive those new fields when they arrive. Put this behind an ng-if=\"theNewFields.length\" so it only gets compiled when those fields are assigned.\n. Thanks! Let me know if there's anything I can do to make things easier for you!\n. Love it! Thanks! You've been an awesome contributor (bridge crosser/builder)!\nLooking at the commits, it looks like you have a few extra commits in there which are bringing your repo up to date with angular-formly. Would really appreciate this PR to be a single commit to keep the history clean. Could you resubmit a new PR that just has a single commit with the changes? Thanks again!\n. The quick and easy way is to just delete your fork and refork :-)\n. Thanks a ton! This is great :-)\n. I'll have the example on the site next time I update (should be later today)\n. This has been deployed! http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/toggle-required\nThanks!\n. Thanks for using formly! You're not alone with this issue. Normally I've just explained that formly does some stuff at compile time and you can't just switch out the fields, but now I'm starting to think that this is a pretty common use case and people need this to work more seamlessly. So, I'm going to see how we can make this work with angular-formly without workarounds. I'll keep you informed.\n. Started work on this. Not sure how I'm going to accomplish it. It's in this branch. Feel free to take a look if you want :-)\n. Unfortunately a workaround like that wouldn't work. The validation issue is a side-effect of the real issue which is that the new fields aren't initialized properly.\n. Another workaround would be something like this. I have a branch (as mentioned above) that I'm working on to make this possible by reinitializing the fields manually. This may be possible. But it will be a little difficult. Still more work to be done there.\n. whoops, this issue is still open and I'm still working on it...\n. @s992, that sounds like a reasonable solution for most use cases. I'll get this in as soon as I am able (probably by tomorrow). Thanks for your patience!\n. Note: master has the unreleased 6.1.1. Please see the Changelog. The track by behavior changed (defaults to nothing), and you can also now specify your own track by:\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"model\" fields=\"fields\" track-by=\"$index\"></formly-field>\nor \nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"model\" fields=\"fields\" track-by=\"field.key\"></formly-field>\nor\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"model\" fields=\"fields\" track-by=\"vm.trackWhateverIWant(field)\"></formly-field>\nI'm now waiting on @s992 and @n0rb to tell me how this supports your use case before I do an official release. Thanks!\n. If you do break it, feel free to add a failing test and I'll take it as a challenge :-)\n. So, I just realized that by adding this new functionality, it actually allows you to totally swap out fields! I had no idea that the track by $index was the culprit here! Please still let me know when you've tested it out, but I'm pretty confident that between this test and these tests we should be covered :-D\n. Thanks!\n. I'm guessing that you figured out the issue because you closed it correct?\n. Busy right now. Will probably have to wait until tomorrow to get to this. Thanks a ton!\n. I'm going to close this. Code coverage is now supported. Still working on coveralls integration (travis is having trouble) but you'll be pleased to hear that we're actually pretty well covered.\n. Looking at the report it's actually only reporting on the index.test.js file which contains all of angular, api-check, and angular-mocks, as well as angular-formly... Do you know of any way to make the coverage plugin leverage sourcemaps or something to make sure that 1) we're only reporting coverage for angular-formly files and 2) it reports coverage for the specific files, not just the entry file?\n. Thanks! You're awesome! :-)\n-Kent C.

I think I've figured out a way to get coverage to exclude non-library related files. I tried it out in angular-scope-types (WIP). Just need to take the time to do it in angular-formly.\n. Finally done!\n. Hmmm... Sounds interesting. Do you think that you could provide an example use case for me so I understand what you're trying to accomplish?\n. By the way, I'm thrilled that you're using this feature. I'm pretty sure it's one of the coolest features of angular-formly that few people understand/know how to use. It's pretty dang powerful.\n. Ah, I see what you're saying... One second...\n. Check it out :-) http://jsbin.com/xeguxi/edit\n. Note! For the love of everything good in the world. Don't go deeper than 3 levels of extends :-)\n. Dude, you're awesome. Thanks! This will be in the next beta release of 6.0.0. Thanks!\n. This is a tough one... What version of angular are you running?\n. Ok, this is the best I can do. And it only works in angular 1.3 ... Will that work for you?\n\n`` javascript\nit(should allow the user to specify their own name for the form, () => {\n  compileAndDigest(\n\n\n\n\n\n  `);\nexpect(scope.parent).to.have.property('formly_0_in_my_ng_repeat');\n  expect(scope.parent).to.have.property('formly_1_in_my_ng_repeat');\n});\n``\n. Doing this would be possible with angular 1.2, but it would involve completely recompiling the entire template once the correct ID was generated. This would be enough of a performance hit that it wouldn't make it worth it I think. I'm just hoping that you're using 1.3 right now... :-)\n. Note, the way it works is it sets thenameattribute of theng-formto{{::'formly_' + ${attrs.bindName}}}. The reason this only works in >= 1.3 is in 1.2, thename` attribute can't be dynamic. :-(\n. Here's the implementation: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/commit/94f82860310c5ae0d3ec17ea0c4427b0d252d6b4\nLet me know what you think, or if you think there's another way to accomplish this...\n. Ok great. I'll merge it in then. Thanks for providing a failing test. That was awesome.\n. This is now part of 6.0.0-beta.10. Hoping to get out of beta soon. Still working out a few kinks.\n. This is closed as illustrated in the test! Let me know if you have trouble!\n. Good catch! Thanks @sparty02! You don't think this needs to be officially released do you? It doesn't cause an issue for consumers of the library right?\n. Ah yes, it actually DOES need to be there so it will install (specifically in future versions of npm when npm doesn't auto-install peerDependencies). So I'll go ahead and fix it and release a new version for good measure. Thanks!\n. While that's true, the problem with making it a dependency is that when I npm install angular-formly it will add api-check to node_modules/angular-formly/node_modules/api-check. But if I want to use api-check in my own project as well, then I will run npm install api-check which will install it in node_modules/api-check. Now I have two versions of api-check in my app.\nPeer Dependencies was created to solve this problem. Not only does it prevent me from having duplicate dependencies, but it also provides me the freedom of choosing which version of the dependency I want (as long as it satisfies the peerDependency which angular-formly enforces to ensure it works properly).\n. I'm starting to feel alone in the \"I love peerDeps\" camp... haha, several tweets and rage posts about them. I've never run into the problems that others seem to have run into. Perhaps you're right. I may consider it a bug fix as part of 6.0.0...\n. Re-opening so I keep this on my mind.\n. Max, I'm not sure I understand what you're suggesting. So, are you\nrecommending that we stick to peer dependencies?\nI'm leaning toward leaving angular as a peer dependency and moving apiCheck\nto a normal dependency.\n- Kent C.

It depends on Angular (obviously) and a Vanilla JS library I wrote called api-check. So, in a sense, it's an angular \"plugin\" that has an extra dependency.\nI'm now thinking that I want to continue to have as loose requirements as possible for peerDependencies so I keep the warnings. But I'm thinking that maybe I'll include dependencies so the dependencies are installed by default. Then consumers can simply use npm dedupe to deal with duplicated dependencies.\nI just don't like the idea of forcing people to do something extra to consume my library, but in npm@3 the peerDeps wont be installed by default anymore so they'd have to install those deps themselves anyway. So I'm torn.\nAlso, there are several template libraries for angular-formly that depend on angular, angular-formly, and api-check. And the angular-formly-templates-material library will also depend on angular-messages, angular-aria, and angular-material. Should all of those be peerDeps and/or regular deps?\nJust want to do the thing that allows the most flexibility and ease-of-use for consumers of the library. I may create a blogpost based on what I decide to do.\nThanks for any advice you can give @linclark :-)\n. Awesome. I think that npm is going to with the package management game for all of JavaScript (at least, I really want it to). So this would be awesome.\nSo am I safe to say that for now, for frontend modules, dependencies should always be listed as peerDependencies with as loose version requirements as possible?\nFor now, I think I'll just use peerDependencies. I'll also have them as devDependencies so I can do my testing during development, but that shouldn't impact users of the module so that's no problem.\nThanks for the help @linclark.\n.

But it's because the key for the field, that's why it needs to be on the model.\n. This is a bit of a poor example. But part of the repeatSection type depends on their being a value initially because it copies the previous section to make the next one. It fails when there's not an existing previous value. You could easily alter the type so this doesn't happen.\n. I updated the example. Go ahead and play around with it. Should work now.\n. Migrated: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/issues/21\n. Are you loading api-check before you load angular-formly?\n. Thanks for checking on that. Do you think you could create an example of the issue using this jsbin as a template?\n. Thanks! Thanks for enduring the pains of upgrading. Looking forward to your example.\n. I just noticed this is a small app I was upgrading and it happened because I didn't change the script tag that's loading apiCheck. In apiCheck 7.0.0, the name of the file changed from apiCheck.js to api-check.js. Make sure that you've updated the file you're loading.\n. Good point. It's likely that most angular-formly users think little to nothing about api-check. Thanks for the feedback.\n. So, I think the better solution would be to make this render faster. If you look at ng-stats with logDigest turned on, you'll see that when you render a form, there are a TON of digests that run. We need to figure out why that is and see if we can make it so only one digest runs. This is high on my priority list because the initial compile of the form fields is just really terrible and needs improving. I'll keep you informed of my progress.\n. That wont be necessary... I have a pretty good working example locally that I'm working though. I think the main trouble is simply the way angular works... But I'm confident that we can find a work around to make this much faster.\n. First off, I should say that I'm not going to implement the original question. Not only is it the incorrect way to go about solving the problem, it's also pretty much impossible without some bad hackery against angular.\n\nSecondly, if anyone wants to contribute to this at all, see this branch where I've started trying to setup some kind of benchmark to test out how to make it faster. Again, I think that it's just an angular problem... Need to figure out a good workaround...\n. By the way. If you would like to be notified when all fields have finished loading, then you could implement something that would probably work by adding a custom link function to all your fields by creating a custom type that all of your other field types extend. Then in that link function, you have access to the field scope which has an options property for the specific field and a fields property for all the fields of the form. Set something on the options.data property to say that the specific field has been loaded, then iterate through the fields to see if all of the fields have had that property set. If they have, then fire an event.\nAs I said, this is a terrible way to go about this. Also, the UI thread is still going to be tied up with angular's digest cycle (so users will likely notice that), but it at least gets you what was originally requested...\n. I'm not sure what you mean by that last bit there...\n- Kent C.

Changing the name of this to resemble what the solution will be. Also, if anyone wants to take a whack at a solution, I've created this example which demonstrates where formly falls over (though, to be honest, I think it's more of an angular problem than a formly problem).\n. @pedrocatre, take a look at using ng-stats to do a quick manual benchmark of the performance of your page with > 100 fields. The idea behind formly is that you only pay for watchers that you absolutely need. So, even though it takes angular a while to compile the template in the first place, you should end up with the fastest possible output for forms using angular.\n\nIt is my expectation that you can't build a faster form with angular even if you hard-coded the HTML it produces. I have never tested this though. I do expect that a hard-coded version would be marginally faster, but not enough to justify not using angular-formly. I would love it if someone verified my expectation. If it turned out incorrect, it would give me hope that there's something formly can do to speed things up.\n. Note, you can use ng-model-options with formly using the modelOptions property.\n. Hoping to work on this soon. I have s lead that looks promising...\n- Kent C.

I think that the problem may be the promise chaining in the link function of a formly-field: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/src/directives/formly-field.js#L187\n\nI believe it's because on every resolve, there's a $digest due to the $q library. I reached out on twitter and got a few tips that lead me to develop these different examples\nCurrent: http://jsbin.com/kudixe/edit \n$$q: http://jsbin.com/fikeku/edit \nNative Promise: http://jsbin.com/pizizi/edit \nUnfortunately, I don't think that these are making a difference currently.

By the way @cnaccio, that's a LOT of fields... I don't know if you'd get good enough performance doing it by hand with just angular...\n. you might look into the read-only example. Never used x-editable myself...\n. Hmmm, looking at x-editable, I don't think that the read-only example will really do it for you... I would probably just create a directive that integrates with x-editable, then create a custom type with a template that uses this directive.\n. @jvandemo, wow! Thanks for setting up the plunkr and the improved example with a setTimeout/$timeout. Unfortunately, I tried it out in my app and it's hard to describe but the user can visually see things getting rendered which isn't very pretty. Kind of a toss-up which is a better experience.\n. I should also mention, there's one place in particular where performance in my app is not so good due to a lot of fields being rendered. @paulirish helped me interpret some Chrome profiling output for it. Perhaps this will be useful to anyone trying to help speed up angular-formly: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSkfqoiZS203BG5hTELTt1GvyD1qc9rDXOpMym9IKlw/edit?usp=sharing\n. Also, I just want to say thank you to anyone helping on behalf of the many developers using angular-formly. Most developers wont come up against these perf issues, but for those of us trying to display many fields, this is definitely a problem. So thanks to anyone who puts time and effort into improving the performance of angular-formly.\n. One thing that I've toyed around with is perhaps compiling everything from the <formly-form> element down manually and then inserting it into the DOM after all the field templates have been resolved. I'm a little sceptical that this would really improve performance though. Just a thought.\n. @jvandemo, for the benefit of those watching at home, this is the code that we're talking about. I believe that this is the bottleneck of the render. It's inside of the formly-field directive's link function.\nHere it is with annotations\njavascript\ngetFieldTemplate(scope.options) // <-- get the template for the field based on it's template/templateUrl or it's type's template/templateUrl\n  .then(runManipulators(formlyConfig.templateManipulators.preWrapper)) // <-- run the preWrapper templateManipulators. This is an array of functions that can return a (modified or unmodified) template string, element, or a promise which resolves to one of these things. We $q.all a $q.when of each of them\n  .then(transcludeInWrappers(scope.options)) // <-- this will \"transclude\" (but not really) the template into any of its own or it's type's wrappers, similar in function to a template manipulator\n  .then(runManipulators(formlyConfig.templateManipulators.postWrapper)) // <-- like the preWrapper manipulators, just another place to put manipulators in the pipeline for maximum flexibility\n  .then(setElementTemplate) // <-- this is where the template is finally $compiled and inserted into the DOM\n  .then(watchFormControl) // <-- this is where we set up a watcher to add the NgModelController to the options. I would be very surprised if this was part of the problem in itself.\n  .then(callLinkFunctions) // <-- this is where we call the field's link function and its type's link function (and any link functions that type extends).\n  .catch(error => {\n    formlyWarn(\n      'there-was-a-problem-setting-the-template-for-this-field',\n      'There was a problem setting the template for this field ',\n      scope.options,\n      error\n    );\n  });\n. Tried commenting out the templateManipulators and wrappers and it made a marginal difference in the plunk but pretty much no difference in my app...\n. I feel like if there were a way to tell angular to pause digests for just a moment while this thing compiled, that would improve things. But that may just be me misunderstanding how compiling things works. Maybe @teropa could provide some insight there?\n. Yeah, I looked at that too. Unfortunately, you can still see the fields getting rendered one-by-one and suddenly appearing. I really want to find a solution where it's all suddenly rendered immediately. I just hope this is something that's possible with angular... Starting to wonder if perhaps changing this to not use promises would improve the situation... Unfortunately, the async api is one of the things that makes angular-formly so consumable.\n. Toyed around with the idea of having two different link functions and using one or the other based on some pre-configured preference. Most developers wont run into this, but if you do, then you may be willing to give up the niceties of the async api for improved performance (if that's what we'd really get by removing the async api...)\n. I think I understand what we think the problem is. You're suggesting that the problem is that a $digest is being called for every promise for every field (which can be huge as a single field could have as many as 10 or more promises). That's what you're suggesting, correct? I think that's what it is as well...\nWhat I don't understand is how putting those promises into a queue outside of the link function will prevent a $digest from being called after they are each resolved. The only thing I could think of to avoid that was to either use $$q or the native Promise (or a polyfill) and trying those didn't seem to make a difference.\nI think I may just be misunderstanding though.\n. Thanks @kentcooper (awesome name by the way). I've been wanting to benchmark this against doing angular forms by hand (without formly) to see if formly is any worse than regular forms. I always believed strongly that it wasn't much worse, but never had any evidence or tested the theory.\nTo be perfectly honest, based on what @kentcooper has said, I'm doubtful that we can improve the performance without doing some serious hackery-trickery with angular... It's not a formly problem, it's an angular problem...\n. Thanks for the help guys! I've spent a little bit of time trying to time things a little better. I'll have time to work on it more later.\n. So I was thinking that maybe the problem is the promise chain. So I created a new feature called syncMode which allows you to tell formly that you don't use templateUrl or need async support for your template manipulators. It's actually pretty neat. I have a branch for it if you're interested in seeing what it takes to support. Wasn't a TON of work... Just a bit of work... Here's the diff\nUnfortunately... It doesn't make a lick of difference... http://output.jsbin.com/tawaxa/edit\nI've all but determined that what's slow here is angular, not angular-formly... Someone please prove me wrong! Many apps need this to be faster...\n. Good point. Hadn't thought about disabling api-check for these perf tests. I'll add that to the most recent plunk...\n. Looks like it speeds it up by 2-3ms per field!\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/SyBNyZjF1XDo6wsDobj4?p=preview\nIt's definitely recommended to turn off api-check in production... To do so, see the api-check docs\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. If someone wants to try to figure out how angular-formly could be improved from a performance standpoint on something specific, that would be great, but I don't see this issue going anywhere at this time.\n. Let me know if this one's not enough :-) http://angular-formly.com/#/example/intro/introduction2\n. @wfsm, sorry, I renamed it: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/intro/codementor\n. oh, and here's an example of two fields not matching: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/matching-two-fields\nFor min/max length, you'd simply use:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'input',\n  key: 'whatever',\n  templateOptions: {\n    minlength: 4,\n    maxlength: 10\n  }\n}\n. Thinking this will make formly too complex to make it worth it. So I added the hide-directive attribute instead. If you want the expressionProperties to work even when the field is hidden with hide, then use hide-directive=\"ng-show\" on that form.\n. Was actually thinking of doing this already. Will be in 6.1.0 :-) in a few moments. Thanks for the issue!\n. This is now released! npm install 6.1.0 See the docs:\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/formlyconfig#extras\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/formly-form#attributes\nThanks again :+1: \n. @gmsewell6, please let me know what you think when you've tried it out. Thanks!\n. so, the placeholder can be whatever. That part isn't dynamic. But you can make it dynamic if you want to. And yes, you could reuse the object above. angular-formly is all about keeping your code DRY, so you could create a custom type that defaults the maxlength and minlength values as well. It's extremely powerful. Come at me with a specific use case and I can explain or show how you'd accomplish it with ease :-)\n. Going to go ahead and close this due to lack of activity. Please feel free to open it again if you have further questions/concerns/need help.\n. Make sure that you either include a template library or create your own type.\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/custom-templates\nOn mobile otherwise I'd be more helpful. Let me know if you need more help and I'll help when I get on later.\n. I'll reopen this to remind me. Thanks!\n. Added. Thanks again!\n. I fixed the template. Could you try it again? Thanks for your patience!\n. Please close this issue if the template works for you :-)\n. Thank you for letting me know it was broken :-)\n. I haven't read through everything yet, but can I just say, this is a terrific bug report. Thank you!\n. Ah! You're right! The docs are out-dated. I'll update that as soon as possible...\nSo, angular-formly now comes equipt with a sweet new feature called the ngModelAttrsTemplateManipulator which will automagically add a bunch of attributes based on the config for the field. What's cool about this is it makes creating custom templates a breeze and saves on the amount of watchers necessary for a particular field.\nOne thing to note about this manipulator is that (with a few exceptions) it will not overwrite attributes that already exist in the template. So, if you specify your own name (for example) then it should not override your own name. I haven't looked at your example yet, but if this behavior is not what you're seeing then that is definitely a bug :-)\nI'll look at your example, but let me know if this clears anything up for you.\n. Alright! You found a real bug! I need to do some work to get it fixed. May be a day or two. But here's a workaround for now :-) Thanks for using angular-formly! I'll let you know when the bug is fixed.\n. The actual solution will be a fix in formly-field, not in the template manipulator. The issue is that the formly-field is watching the field id rather than respecting the possibility that a user could specify a custom name.\n. Alright, updated the docs! Now to fix the bug!\n. I think I've got it! Master has been updated and your bug reproduction is working as expected now. Let me know if I've missed anything. Once I get the ok from you, I'll cut a release! Thanks!\n. There is no solution that I have found in the open source world. But I can tell you that in my app, we actually don't use the pre-built templates and have custom templates. We use bootstrap for our columns and simply have a specified column width for all of our labels and our fields. And labels are a part of the fields via a wrapper. This is the result.\n\nI'll make an example for this when I have time. It should be trivial to accomplish using any css grid system (including flexbox).\n. You're very welcome! And thanks! I want formly to be as helpful as possible and it's rewarding to me when I see it being helpful to other developers.\nI take it that you don't need the example right away based on you closing this issue?\n. Actually could you move it to the angular-formly-website repo? Thanks!\n. Quick look on mobile looks good, but I'd like to verify before merging. Thanks!\n. Looks good! Thanks. I'm also going to add the ability to return a promise from these functions just to mirror all other apis.\n. Watch the first video on this page:\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.2.0/docs/learn-angular-formly\nToward the end I talk about this.\nLet me know if you have more questions.

Note, obviously, you've got some serious performance considerations, so you may need to take things at a bit of a different approach. If you have a bunch of fields with their own hide conditions, instead of paying for a watcher for each of those, create your own watcher and respond to model changes yourself (by setting hide on the appropriate fields).\n\nIt's not as clean and neat, but that's the reality of the performance situation. :-(\n. So I've now had time to actually read through your issue. For the headings, you might consider not using angular-formly and just coding that up yourself in the HTML. This would allow you to using ng-if without a problem.\n. @pedrocatre, yes, I do mean creating watchers outside of the JSON. This is because there's a watcher created for every time you have a watcher. And they all watch the same thing. It's just some extra overhead that may not be necessary.\nThe hide thing is not a bug. Basically, when the field is hidden behind the ng-if, it never compiles which means the expressionProperties never get set up and cannot run.\nI may be able to add a hideExpression attribute which could make life a little bit easier for you. It would not be a normal formlyExpression though. It could be a function or a string, but it would be evaluated on the formly-form not the formly-field so you wouldn't have access to the same stuff... But it should be enough for what you want (it'll have the model for example).\n. In the latest beta, I added a hideExpression property. Give that a shot.\n- Kent C.

Let me know what you think.\n. I'm not sure I understand what you mean... ng-repeat is working under the hood...\n. I think all you're saying is that you'd like a pre-defined type that does this. You don't want to have to define it yourself. Is that right?\n. I see... Well, types are a template concern. And templates are specific to css frameworks. Are you looking for a bootstrap template then?\n. As a side, I highly recommend that if you're going to be serious about creating forms in your app, you should create your own types. As awesome as the template libraries are, they can't beat the customizability required for a serious application. And types are so easy to create that you shouldn't have a problem with it.\n. I see. I think having that built-into angular-formly could be useful... I'll see if I can think of a good way to include that.\n. @jlowery457, I improved the example: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/advanced/repeating-section\n. If anyone wants to discuss a good API as well as a good implementation, I would love to talk about it. I'd really love to improve support for repeating fields/fieldGroups, but I'm not certain as to the best way to go about implementing it.\n. I recently added the functionality to specify a fieldTransform on a global/form level that I think takes care of the json schema issue and may cover this case as well. Have you had a chance to look at that?\n. Docs\n. Yes, this runs as one of the first things in the formly-form controller, so you can add/remove/modify any fields. Meaning what you send it can be total nonsense and as long as what you return is an array of valid field configurations, then you're good. I'll try to create an example as soon as I am able.\n. Is anyone still waiting for this feature? I'm sorry I haven't really looked into implementing it. It's not the most straightforward one to implement.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of someone creating a plugin.\n. Sorry I haven't responded until now. Been kinda drowning recently. I'm not certain what the problem is. Why don't you have a look at this example and see if you can get it working.\n. Ah, the problem is actually a jqLite bug that has been fixed in 1.4.x and I don't expect will be backported to 1.3.x :-( https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11038\n\nThe only way to accomplish the ng-repeat with ng-messages is to use 1.4.x or include jQuery\n. Oh, sorry, I thought you were talking about overriding messages set in the formlyValidationMessages service. Yeah, simply using the template wont work, but that's not a formly thing, that's an ng-messages thing. If you want defaults, use the formlyValidationMessages service. This is why you generally don't want to have any custom ng-message directives in there. Just the ones in the ng-repeat.\nI'll have to look at making sure everything works ok in angular@1.4.x. I was under the impression that it did, but I'll double check that. Thanks!\n. Hmmm.... It really depends on the experience that you want to give your user... I wouldn't say that either of those is necessarily the \"right\" way to tell formly about them...\n. So, what I would recommend is using a router resolve feature which allows you to make requests before a controller is loaded and inject the results into the controller. That way you keep your controllers as synchronous as possible. This is just good practice in general in my opinion.\n. Good question, should have specified. For some advanced layout stuff, I want to have a \"field\" in place just to have a node there with a specific class. So something like:\n{template: '', className: 'my-class-name'}\n. Right now, I have to do:\n{template: 'nbsp;', className: 'my-class-name'}\nLess fun...\n. It's actually not a directive, and it's never actually rendered.

Sorry if api-check is hurting your feelings. But it's for the best. Much better than going down a road for a few hours before realizing that you're using angular-formly wrong.\n\n\nAs for your question. First off, your config is wrong. I'm guessing this was just a copy/paste error or something, but you have templateOptions and expressionProperties inside the validators property... They should all be sibling properties at the root of the config object.\nSecondly, angular-formly doesn't support disabling validators. This is the first time I've heard of this use case... Perhaps you could describe what your use-case is and I can give you the right way to do it or we can figure out how angular-formly can cover your use-case better.\n. Yeah, a better way would be to not use expressionProperties and actually just set the value based on the state (create/edit). So when you create the field, before you add the validator, check to see if you're in edit mode. If you are, don't add the validator. Also, instead of using expressionProperties for disabled, just say something like: disabled: isEditMode or something like that. That's what I do. It's better for several reasons. Would that work?\n. something like:\njavascript\n{\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {\n    validateFoo: isEditMode ? undefined : {\n      expression:  vm.someFunc,\n      message: '\\'some message'\\'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n}\n. I do stuff like that all the time\n. Note, for people who are persisting their config to a database and need it to just work with JSON, then another solution would be to make checking the mode part of the validator.\n. Glad that'll work for you :+1: \n. In all honesty, I haven't done that for validators before. I'm not certain why that is causing you issues, but one thing that you could do is something like this:\n``` javascript\nvar myField = {\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {},\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n};\nif (!isEditMode) {\n  myField.validators.fooValidator = {\n    / snip /\n  };\n}\n```\n. Actually, you know what would be even better:\njavascript\n{\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {\n    validateFoo: isEditMode ? 'true' : {\n      expression:  vm.someFunc,\n      message: '\\'some message'\\'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n}\n. Hmmm... That's crazy.... That should totally work... (the undefined solution should have worked as well)... Try this:\njavascript\n{\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {\n    validateFoo: isEditMode ? {expression: 'true'} : {\n      expression:  vm.someFunc,\n      message: '\\'some message'\\'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n}\n. http://jsbin.com/foramu/1/edit?html,js,output :-)\n. Haha, that's actually a common pitfall. But it's literally an angular expression, so there's really no way to get around it :-( Glad you got it working! :dancer: \n. :+1: \n.

I improved the docs for validation\n. Yeah, so if you're loading it from a server then you'll have to use the string version for your watcher and other expressions. In-lining functions as strings will not work (and would be a very bad idea). Here's an example that may be helpful to you: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/json-powered\n\n\nP.S. I recommend avoiding using watcher if you can. It's better to try to use expressionProperties. Mostly from a performance standpoint.\n. Let me know if that is enough to get you going.\n. Absolutely. Depending on the dropdown's templateOptions, you might do something like this: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/filter-select\n. Yes, I totally love js-data from @jmdobry. @jmdobry, would love to collaborate on a library that could convert your schema to mine and then back again so your users can use angular-formly and my users can use js-data. Would be amazingly awesome.\n. angular-formly is pretty versatile, but I made an example using is.js and it was pretty cool.\n. I also tweeted about it a few days ago. Found a few libraries there.\n. I actually don't think that I'll ever get to this. If someone else wants to do this, I'd happily help them get started. I'm going to go ahead and close this though as I don't plan on actually implementing it.\n. To, anyone interested in implementing this. I added a new feature in 6.14.0 that allows you to specify a fieldTransform function to convert a given field configuration into something that angular-formly understands. So accomplishing something like this should be a matter of writing a fieldTransform to convert js-data schema into formly field configurations.\n. This is definitely something that I want to make work. Give me some time to look into it later.\n. I created a jsbin for it to demonstrate the issue: http://jsbin.com/goduno/edit\n. Boy, you've really got me stumped... I don't know how to accomplish that design based on how angular-formly works. Could you describe the UI you're trying to actually build? Maybe I can help you figure out a work-around.\n. That shouldn't be too difficult to add I think... If you think that it would work and you need that functionality, then I may take the time to add it.\n. I don't think any drawbacks of having multiple formly-forms would be noticeable. If you wanted to make sure that formState was shared between all of the fields (in the different forms) then you'd have to make sure it was initialized prior to the forms rendering. Another thing you'd need to be aware of is that the fields property for each of the forms would be different. Not normally a real issue though. I think you've found a good solution. Do you mind creating an example for the website?\n. Ah, good catch. I didn't notice that. Basically, the last formly-form would overwrite the other ones. So you don't want to do that. Instead, wrap all of them in a single ng-form or form and specify a name on that and don't worry about specifying a form attribute on any of the formly-forms (unless you're interested in that specific form controller for some reason).\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. An example for the website would be welcome. Thanks @DrDanRyan!\n. I'm not sure I understand the problem you're having. Could you follow the instructions here so we can help you better? http://help.angular-formly.com\n. That issue on npm is the solution. I'll get this implemented soon.

Could you please produce an example of the problem. It's very difficult for me to help without that. Clone this template to produce the example.\n. This appears to be a problem with how ngf-select deals with the ng-model and how angular-formly watches the model (the error is thrown when angular's doing dirty checking). I personally use angular-upload and have had great success with it.

The best way to get help is by following instructions here: help.angular-formly.com\n. chat.angular-formly.com is not a stack overflow room. It just forwards you to a chat room on gitter. It can be helpful for you to ask a stack overflow question with the angular-formly tag as well because sometimes the people over there can help answer your questions as well.\n. Hey @benoror, thanks for the help! A few things.\n\nFirst, I don't want to have all of that commit history in the repo when I merge this. Please remove all that history and just have a single commit with your changes.\nSecond, I tried your changes locally and it doesn't work on my mac. I definitely want to have a solution that works everywhere. I'm thinking that a good solution would be to have a single script that sets the environment variables for us and invokes the scripts. So it would be something like:\njson\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build:dist\": \"node scripts/run-script.js build:dist\",\n  \"build:prod\": \"node scripts/run-script.js build:prod\",\n  \"build\": \"node scripts/run-script.js build\",\n  \"test\": \"node scripts/run-script.js test\",\n  \"test:single\": \"node scripts/run-script.js test:single\",\n  \"test:ci\": \"node scripts/run-script.js test:ci\",\n  \"watch\": \"node scripts/run-script.js watch\",\n  \"start\": \"node scripts/run-script.js start\",\n  \"release\": \"node scripts/run-script.js release\"\n}\nAnd the scripts/run-script.js would actually set process.env.NODE_ENV before invoking the script. Do you think that would work?\n. Absolutely. Thank you for being patient and working at it. Much appreciated! :+1: \n. Closing this PR. I like the middleware approach you mentioned. Feel free to take a stab at a PR for it if you're feeling ambitious :-)\n. Actually, someone ran into this same issue on twitter the other day: https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/601765588533317632\nHere's an example with an explanation of what the problem is: http://jsbin.com/mepega/edit?html,js,output\nTL;DR\nDon't specify a form attribute on the formly-form with the same name. Just leave it off altogether or change the name.\nPlease re-open this issue if that doesn't fix your problem :-)\n. You have it, right in your template. It's the fc variable (which is a shortcut to the options.formControl variable).\n. Ah, I see what you're saying. @ckniffen mentioned this angular issue on Gitter the other day. The problem is that the formController's parent is $submitted but that property doesn't get propagated down to children forms. @ckniffen, do you have a recommendation on how to handle this? One thing I can think of is to $watch the $submitted state and set it on the child forms manually...\n. Awesome! Feel free to make a PR :+1: \n. What is your reasoning for wanting this? I'm a big fan of controller as, but I don't see a reason for it here.\n. I don't think that there's a way that we could do any better than that. And, as much as I love controller as, I don't see the benefits in this scenario. Closing this unless someone can convince me otherwise.\n. I can see the benefit of making it private (in fact, in my app, I never actually register any of my controllers with angular). But I definitely firmly believe that the benefits of controllerAs cannot be seen in a type's controller. And we're also supporting angular 1.2 still, so we can't switch to use it in our own internal directives.\n. Wish I had metrics on what version of angular people are using with\nformly...\n- Kent C.

Don't worry, it's actually not too painful to support Angular 1.2 right now, but I'm curious to hear how many people are using angular-formly with angular 1.2. I will likely eventually drop support, but when I do, it will definitely be a major version change, so you shouldn't be auto-upgraded. And I'll make an announcement (so follow me on twitter)\n. Closing. I don't think I'll be dropping 1.2 support for a while, it's really not a huge pain to support right now (though I do have some custom code for it that would be nice to get rid of). I'll comment in this issue if I'm thinking about dropping support, and don't worry, as long as you use a ^ or ~ in your dependency listing, I wont push a break to you (because it'll be part of a major version change).\n. Thanks for the input @PascalPrecht!\n\nFor everyone, updating angular-formly to drop support for 1.2 costs me more time than leaving support for 1.2 right now, so I think that I'll leave it as is because it's working well and doesn't hinder the experience of developers using the latest version of angular. But support for 1.2 will be dropped eventually for sure. But again, it will be in a major release version so as long as you're using exact versioning or you're using ^ or ~ you should be fine.\n. Yeah, I think that v7 will likely be the last version to support IE. I'll remove support for it in v8 (\ud83d\udc48 not the JS engine...) :-)\n. Nope, I think a normal $scope.$watch in your controller is the best way to\ndo that. You could also look into the watch property on the field, but I'd\nprobably just do a normal watch.\n- Kent C.

I haven't had a chance to pull it down yet, but I want to verify with you that you think this is the best way (rather than the directive approach).\n. Hmmm, yes... Good question...

By the way, thank you sooooo much for squashing this into a single commit. Makes the git history sooo much cleaner :+1: \n. Fantastic catch @koenweyn. I'll have a fix for this asap. The problem is that because the root el isn't a form or ng-form, there is no FormController but angular-formly overrides it anyway.

You should be able to get this in 6.11.5 and/or 6.12.0-beta.1. Enjoy!\n. I would like some feedback on this one from people please!\n. @dwolt, thanks for your perspective! The challenge is that there's some crazy code to make things work the way that people expect it should anyway. It also has been the source of several questions from people who've spent a few hours with issues related to this... Though, thinking about it now, some of those questions and issues would not be solved by this change anyway, so maybe I should keep the old code around...\n. This is significant a change. I'm about to release a few minor breaking changes in 7.0.0. I'm going to push this off to a different breaking release so people can benefit from the 7.0.0 release without having to pay the price for this change.\n. I like your suggestion @koraybalci. We could add a console warning to the formly-form directive and then remove it later in a major version. The problem is upgrading all of those examples would be incredibly painful. lol. It's funny that the thing that protects users the most from breaking changes is the effort it takes to upgrade documentation!\nWhat if instead we made the form controller optional to start?\n.

This is being tracked here (I recommend you subscribe to that issue).\n<canned-message>\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly. The issues are for bug reports/feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. If you have a question or need help, please watch this screencast for an explination of the most effective/proper way to get help using angular-formly.\nSummarized:\n1. Learn angular-formly basics\n2. Check the examples\n3. Reproduce the issue\n4. Ask on Stack Overflow\n5. Ask on the mailing list\n6. Ask on Chat\nP.S. sorry for the canned message, this just happens a lot :smile: \n</canned message>\n. Example has been created: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/testing\n. Most modern angular applications don't need the name to be anything special, just unique. If you have this use case, you have a bunch of different ways you could accomplish it. My recommendation: create your own types, don't use one of the template libraries. I would say that your use case is not common for modern applications. Luckily, angular-formly is pretty darn flexible and creating custom templates is quite easy.\n\nYou could do this using ngModelAttrs, however it's a bit of a complicated API and I would actually just advise creating your own template to accomplish what you want in this case. It is intended that the id and the name are something that you don't need to think about and hence, the template libraries don't come with this capability out of the box.\n...\nThinking about it further... I think that it wouldn't be unreasonable to bring this functionality into angular-formly. Currently, you can specify your own id as part of the field configuration object. This will be propagated to both the field's id as well as its name. I don't think it's unreasonable to allow you to specify a name property as well which would be used for the field's name if present, otherwise it would default to the id... What do you think?\n. You've convinced me. I'll try to get to this asap.\nFor anyone looking to contribute, here's a high-level of what needs to be done:\n1. Write a few tests (probably here):\n   - name (on both the options object and on the scope) defaults to random thing that's the same as the id\n   - name is the same as id when an id is specified\n   - name is equal to the name property specified on the field options object (and is different than the id)\n2. Add name to the api-check for a field. Somewhere around here\n3. Add setFieldName logic to the FormlyFieldController. Somewhere around here potentially even change setFieldId to setFieldIdAndName... Do something like $scope.options.name = $scope.options.name || $scope.options.id at the end\n4. Update this line to use scope.name rather than scope.id.\nI'd recommend giving this a watch if you haven't already.\nIf nobody gets to this before I do, then that's fine...\n. Thanks to @benoror, this is now supported in 6.13.0. Thanks!\n. Looks like I've pushed a new version since you opened this. I'll remove it next chance I get :-)\n. Hmmm... Yeah, I suppose that internally we'll do something like this:\njavascript\nconst fieldTransform = $scope.options.fieldTransform || formlyConfig.extras.fieldTransform;\nif (fieldTransform) {\n  $scope.fields = fieldTransform($scope.fields);\n}\nThat way you could either copy them yourself or simply modify them to maintain references to the correct field.\nThe reason that I bring this up is that if formly-field actually makes a copy for you, then you may be pointing to the field that you create in your controller, but that ends up not being the field that formly actually uses, which could lead to unexpected behavior.\nBut I think that kind of an implementation in formly-form would be pretty flexible.\n. I have pushed some tests for this feature. I've actually already developed this feature and gotten all the tests passing locally, but I want to give someone the chance to make their first OSS contribution, so here are some instructions (if you have already contributed to open source, please let someone else take this one):\n- [x] Watch this video to learn what you need to do to get things setup\n- [x] Go to this line and change describe.skip to describe.only\n- [x] Run $ npm test\n- [x] Notice that all the tests are failing\n- [x] Update formlyApiCheck.js to allow the formly-form options to have a fieldTransform that's a function (somewhere around here)\n- [x] Add a function call right after this one in formly-form.js called setupFields and declare it below (probably around setupOptions) where you'll put your logic for initializing the fields (which means you could probably move this to that new function).\n- [x] Implement setupFields to make the tests pass.\n- [x] Once they're passing, change the describe.only to describe so all the tests run.\n- [x] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #343 (notice it runs all the tests... twice)\n- [x] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR, get merged, celebrate \ud83c\udf89\n.

Ah, good point @koenweyn. angular-formly does use console.warn in several places when you're using its API incorrectly as well. I recommend disabling api-check as well as warnings when you ship to production (leave it on in development though). I will add this recommendation to the docs for supporting IE 8.\n.

There's a lot of duplicate code in those two script files.\n. This works awesome! I have an idea though... One sec...\n. Why don't we create a library for this? I want to use this in other projects. Here's the API I envision...\nI install your library as a dependency. We'll call it better-npm-run for now... Then in my package.json, I do this:\njson\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:dist\": \"better-npm-run\",\n    \"test\": \"better-npm-run\"\n  },\n  \"betterScripts\": {\n    \"build:dist\": \"NODE_ENV=development webpack --config $npm_package_webpack --progress --colors\",\n    \"test\": \"NODE_ENV=test karma start\"\n  }\n}\nOr something like that? It would just be nice to have all my scripts right in the package.json.\nAnd the library would manage ensuring that setting environment variables work cross-platform. What do you think?\n. Hmmm... That is a bit verbose, and it prevents me from doing this: NODE_ENV=something some-command && NODE_ENV=somethingElse some-other-command though there's a work-around... Hmmm... Probably would be fine to start with what you have :+1: \n. Sorry, by the way, I just fixed up a thing or two with package.json so that's why this can't merge anymore :-(\n. Awesome! I'll take a look at it!\n. Hey man, just tried it out on my new library and it worked great for me. I didn't even notice a difference. :+1: \n. Thanks for building that! I've implemented it.

This is indeed a bug. fieldGroup uses a formly-form itself and it copies attributes and their values from the parent formly-form (except for attributes like model, and fields). The problem is that it should also account for data-model and data-fields etc. You're welcome to make a PR. Otherwise I'll look at this as soon as I am able...\nShould be pretty simple, just need to add the data counterpart to this array\n. I don't think that there would be a problem with adding the attribute style to this directive.

Thanks!\n. @ckniffen, not sure I understand what you mean. The $parsers and $formatters apis are available in angular 1.2\n. Yes, it would be similar to formly-custom-validation except it would do something like: ctrl.$parsers = ctrl.$parsers.concat(options.parsers) or ctrl.$parsers = options.parsers.concat(ctrl.$parsers) depending on which order we decide to apply the new parsers.\n\nThen there's the decision on how to merge them...\n. @benoror, yes, it will, that's what I'm planning on doing. But we need to consider defaultOptions and overriding as well as considering existing $parsers and $formatters.\n. That's mostly what I want feedback on (noted in the numbered list above)\n. Sounds good.\nFor your \"as an object\" suggestion, I considered that as well. The problem is then you have to figure out how to determine which to push on the pipeline first. So I think that an id would probably be better. But can anyone think of a use case where this would be needed? I think I'll leave it out until someone mentions they need it...\n. Here's my plan for implementation:\nWhen merging parsers, they will be concatenated together. Options can be merged in four scenarios. This is the order the parsers will be concatenated (meaning the parsers will run from the top of this list to the bottom):\n1. Extended type\n2. Type\n3. optionsTypes (in order specified)\n4. parsers specified on the field\nFor example:\n``` javascript\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'parent1',\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [parent1Parser1, parent1Parser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'parent2',\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [parent2Parser1, parent2Parser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'child',\n  extends: 'parent1', // <-- note this!\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [childParser1, childParser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'optionType1',\n  extends: 'parent2', // <-- note this!\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [optionType1Parser1, optionType1Parser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'optionType2',\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [optionType2Parser1, optionType2Parser2]\n  }\n});\n// parser definitions excluded for brevity...\n// elsewhere... in some controller\nvar vm = this;\nvm.fields = [\n  {\n    type: 'child',\n    optionsTypes: ['optionType1', 'optionType2'],\n    parsers: [fieldParser1, fieldParser2]\n  }\n];\n```\nThe resulting merged array for this field's parser would appear as:\njavascript\n[\n  parent1Parser1, parent1Parser2,\n  childParser1, childParser2,\n  parent2Parser1, parent2Parser2,\n  optionType1Parser1, optionType1Parser2,\n  optionType2Parser1, optionType2Parser2,\n  fieldParser1, fieldParser2\n]\nFormatters will be the exact same.\nCould someone sanity check me on this one? It's a little confusing, I don't use parsers/formatters very often, so someone with more experience may be able to help me to determine the most logical solution. I think this is correct though. Just want to make sure that I'm covering my bases!\nP.S. Doing something like this with that many parsers would be utter insanity... Just had that thought :-) But this is a very contrived example\n. Note, in the case of formatters, they will be executed in reverse order as indicated by the docs. But I believe this is also desirable behavior...\n. Just got the above example to pass as a test for parsers. I'm going to push this up into master. I would really appreciate if interested parties try it out and ensure that it works as you expect. I'll be working on formatters next. After I get some feedback (and fix anything) then I'll release a beta so more people can try it out. I'm concerned about getting this feature right, so please help by trying it out.\n. Sorry, jumped the gun. I broke several other tests with my implementation. I'll comment when I've actually pushed the parsers stuff.\n. Alright, it's working great! I've decided to make all parsers evaluate as formlyExpressions which means they can be expressed as strings and they also have access to the field's scope (and therefore the field's options). Also, I've actually just released a beta version that has parsers support. Again, please test it out and make sure I haven't missed anything important. I'll add formatters once I hear that parsers is working out for people (should reuse much of the same code).\nnpm install angular-formly@6.21.0-beta.0\n. Alrighty, formatters support is in the next beta version. Please provide feedback:\nnpm install angular-formly@6.21.0-beta.1\n. Has anyone had a chance to validate that this works as you'd expect? I don't really have a use case for this in my app, so it's hard for me to know whether it makes sense as implemented.\n. It's out of beta :-) Thanks for the feedback!\n. Thanks for trying it out @koenweyn! I'm sure that we could make it work without trouble. It would amount to adding that logic you have to this function. This seems like a good opportunity for a first-timers-only issue. Do you think that you could file a bug separately and I'll prepare the issue for a first timer? (you could even prepare it if you would like).\n. Precisely :-) You can see the others\n. @synthecypher, I created an example for the website. It will be live soon. If you can't wait 3 more minutes for it to deploy, here it is :-)\n. You add them as part of the defaultOptions :-)\n. The best way to get help is to follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for commenting @a-laughlin. I actually like that idea a lot. Unless someone comes along with a good rebuttal, I think this is what I'll do.\nThis can be implemented as a \"smooth\" breaking change, as in, I'll add the asyncValidators property, and add a console warning to any non asyncValidators validator that returns a promise that this api is being deprecated and they must either return true or false, or they must use the new asyncValidators api.\nWould love more input (even if it's a :+1:). I think this is where I'm going.\n. Released as 6.18.0. Not a breaking change. Simply allows you to add asyncValidators explicitly. Also, you can specify formlyConfig.extras.explicitAsync which will prevent any of your validators from being placed onto the $asyncValidators pipeline.\n. Just updated the example\n. This is definitely possible, but it's not the default behavior in angular and angular-formly doesn't (isn't going to) support this in the core because it's pretty use-case specific. You could use an onChange in the templateOptions of your checkbox that removes the values you wish. That would likely be a good solution I think.\n\n<canned-message>\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Ask on Chat\nP.S. sorry for the canned message, this just happens a lot :smile: \n</canned message>\n. Good question. I believe the docs are unclear. If the type you have specified has wrappers assigned to it, then the only way to get rid of them is to use null which will remove all wrappers (as you have pointed out). There is not currently a way in angular-formly to completely override wrappers. So you'll have to create another type that has the wrappers you want. You can use formlyConfig.getType to copy properties from an existing type to a new, similar type that you create.\n\nI'm thinking that as a breaking change for the next version, I'll make it so that if wrapper are specified on the field, then the type's wrappers will not apply. That seems to me to make the most sense. (while I'm at it, I'll change the name from wrapper to wrappers because most of the time it is specified as an array anyway.\n. Would love feedback from anyone on this breaking change for the next version:\n1. Any problem changing the term wrapper to wrappers as it's specified as an array most of the time?\n2. Any problem removing the default wrapper behavior? Basically, if you specify the name 'default' then it will wrap all types. This is a little bit too magical I think. And I believe it's undocumented.\n3. Any problem changing behavior so that if you specify a wrappers array on a field then rather than joining with the wrappers from the type, it entirely overrides them?\n4. I've recently thought that <formly-transclude></formly-transclude> is quite long. Any suggestions on whether it should be something else/shorter?\n5. Anything else anyone would like to see change in wrappers?\n. Good comments @redhead. I'll keep the formly-transclude then\n@pdemilly, I love the idea of it being an object with keys. The problem with that is how to define order. Once you do that you get into an issue with priority... We've talked about this on #368. What we could do though is give a wrapper an ID and you could optionally specify a wrapper as an object with a name and an id. Something like:\njavascript\nwrappers: ['foo', {name: 'bar', id: 'barWrapper'}]\nThough I still think that this is less simple than just overriding the type's properties altogether. Thoughts?\n. Oh, I like that a lot. And that could be non-breaking as well... Problem is that it's not quite as obvious, so I think I'll still have a breaking change to make it override wrappers when specified, but I think optionally giving it a function opens a lot of flexibility.\n. Definitely not going to get into priority. I would hate to see the day where I see: priority: Infinity and priority: Infinity + 1 :-(\nWe need this to be simpler, not more complex.\n. Can you give more info? Give us more of the error message. What version of angular-formly and angular are you using?\n. I'm not sure what's going on.

Doing this saves big time on watchers (two watchers per form rather than two per field). You'll need to either bind the tabs model's to formState (probably easier) or you'll have to add a $watch to your controller and invoke the runExpressions function on the fields yourself.

Not only that, but the context in which the string version is evaluated doesn't have access to $scope.\n. Actually, the way angular works is it only runs validation on the NgModelController that actually had a changed value. This was a decision that comes with downsides for sure. The one downside is that you have to tell angular to re-validate the fields yourself. You have a handle on the NgModelController via the options.formControl property (or the shortcut of fc if you have the field's scope). Here's an example that may help you. It uses an expressionProperty to accomplish this.\n<canned-message>\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Ah, in that case, place a templateOptions.onChange = function($viewValue, $modelValue, scope) { ... } and do the logic in there instead. (You have access to the other field via the scope.fields property)\n. Note, this wouldn't be without a migration path. Because of the fieldTransform functionality, I could provide a workable fieldTransform (with instructions/an example on how to use it) that you could copy to your project and slowly migrate the forms in your project over time. It wouldn't be perfect, but I think it would work well. So don't let that part scare you. I'm more concerned about the idea. Do you think this would make angular-formly more approachable/simple/maintainable/etc.?\n. Hopefully most templates will require very few changes. The idea of most of these attributes is that they would be dynamically added to the ng-model element(s) in the template so the templates don't have to concern themselves with them. But I know at least the bootstrap templates' label wrapper uses required and would require updating. But that would be trivial and I would likely make a shortcut for this new property (like the to shortcut for options.templateOptions, we'd probably have ma for options.ngModelAttrs or something like that).\n. Not quite, but from a template author's perspective, you should hopefully have just a few places to update things. Unfortunately, from a user's perspective, many field properties that used to live in templateOptions would go to ngModelAttrs instead. As I said, I'd make a demonstration of a  fieldTransform that would allow you to make that transition over time, but eventually you'd want to rewrite all of your field configuration objects to resemble the new format.\n. I agree @redhead, I don't like the name either (especially since it's already in use and it seems long and ugly to me too). I'd love suggestions on a better one... Perhaps we can consider something that would make sense in both an angular 1 and angular 2 context...\n. Hmmm... I'll have to think on that a little more. I'm trying to think what would be most obvious for a new comer... ngModelAttrs is the best name I can think of for someone new to angular-formly but used to angular forms...\n. @dwolt, your perspective as a user is exactly what I'm trying to get, so thanks for sharing!\n\nOriginally, angular-formly didn't have any kind of structure for its options. If you wanted to create a new template, you would just add your own property to the field config object and life was good. Until the angular-formly core library comes around and decides to use a property of the same name for some other purpose and now you're stuck.\nFor example, let's imagine that you decide you want to make a special input that allows you to react when when you type into the input. You would probably add an onKeyup property to the field config and use that:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'datepicker',\n  onKeyup: function(event) {\n    if (event.which === 32) {\n      console.log('space typed!!');\n    }\n  }\n}\nThen angular-formly comes along and decides to add this to all fields, but makes the function arguments different. Instead of passing the event, it passes the $viewValue or something. Or perhaps angular-formly processes your field differently because that field exists. This would prevent you from upgrading until you refactored all of your fields.\nHopefully that makes sense and builds a case for the separation as well as the use of api-check in this project. I force you to place your own stuff in either data or templateOptions and I let you have full reign over those objects. Except in the case of templateOptions, there are properties that angular-formly uses to do some of its magic. Which sort of reintroduces the original issue. Which is why I'm suggesting this change would be worth the migration.\nDoes that make sense? Any holes in my logic? Is it not worth it?\nAsside from that, the templateOptions stuff is a little magical and is something that you must learn. It's not really intuitive. Something like ngModelAttrs makes a lot of sense. You just think to yourself: \"What would I normally put alongside the ng-model element, there's probably a property for that.\"\n. @rmulder, I cannot express how sorry I am that the change to hideExpression didn't work for you. I remember you mentioning having difficulties with it, but I didn't realize how wide sweeping a change that was for you. The reason it didn't result in a breaking change was the old way still works just as it did before, so you can stick with that. And I could add something that allows you to disable the warning formly now gives if you try to use hide in an expressionProperty if you want. I'm just so so sorry that this  has caused you grief :-(\nI appreciate you voicing your opinion and I will make sure that this upgrade is as painless as possible. I'm confident that a fieldTransform could quite easily make this work out of the box (you'd just copy/paste the field transform and it should work for you).\nOne thing I wish to clarify is that this library is not \"under development.\" This library works really really well and I could stop working on it and people would benefit from it for as long as angular 1.x is around. It is, however, being developed and improved. I just want to reiterate that angular-formly is no more \"under development\" as angular is. It's solid and it honors semver. I expect this isn't what you meant @rmulder, but I want to make it clear that angular-formly is a production-ready library :+1: :-)\n. Good thoughts everyone. Thanks for providing feedback (keep it coming). I'm going to think on this for a bit and I'll get back to you with what I decide on.\n. @ckniffen, you've convinced me with this line:\n\nThe reason being is that more implementation details now need to be known in order to know which object to place properties.\n\nI want to try really hard to not force people to know implementation details. For that reason, I'm closing this issue.\nBig thanks to everyone who dropped their opinion in here. Note, I do intend to implement #378 which should make it easier to add custom attributes to the ng-model element. Feel free to read up on that and drop an opinion on there. That will not be a breaking change :-)\n. Also, I intend to implement adding the extras property onto the field configuration object. This object would be apiChecked by formly (as opposed to the templateOptions and data properties) and would be used to configure stuff that's specific to angular-formly core (rather than a template library). (Though, having just written that, it sounds like implementation details, but I think this is one case that we can make an exception due to the fact that these are edge cases).\n. Fantastic. Thank you!\n. This has been released (and tested) in 6.16.1. Thanks for finding the bug!\n. And thanks even more for fixing it and explaining it so well :-)\n. Awesome. I think that I'm going to implement this one. I think it's a good idea and much simpler than the existing ngModelAttrs.\n. The existing ngModelAttrs is a highly complicated API because it's highly optimized. This would just make things more straightforward.\n. @sparty02, while your concern is valid, I think that the most straightforward name would be something like: ngModelElementAttributes, but that's way too wordy. If we abbreviate the stuff that makes sense, we can do: ngModelElAttrs and that's much better. I can't think of any other name that would be more strightforward.\n. This is indeed a bug. I'm on vacation, so I can't look at this now, but a\ntested PR would be welcome.\n- Kent C.

Seems like it could be an issue with your own settings.\n. @prokilogrammer, I'm sorry, but this is actually how it's supposed to work. The docs aren't very clear, but if you look above the docs for value, there's a callout that says:\nAdded Properties\nThe properties listed below are added to your field configuration.\n\nMeaning that you shouldn't override them, but they are actually added. It's purpose is to be used internally to get the current value as well as when you specify modelOptions as specified in the docs:\nUnder value\n\nUseful when using getterSetter: true in the modelOptions\n\nUnder modelOptions\n\nNote, if you use the getter/setter option, formly's templateManipulator will change the value of ng-model to options.value which is a getterSetter that formly adds to field options\n\nSo I wont be accepting #383. I'm sorry :-/\nNow, I think what you're wanting to do (based on your example) is use either parsers of formatters which is on the roadmap in #368.\n.

While doing this may be a little less helpful in the short-term, it does help people figure things out for themselves and they learn how angular-formly works so they have fewer questions in the future and they're able to use angular-formly more productively.\nAs a note to your specific example, you could pretty easily extend an existing type to add support for the cc-card attribute :-) I created an example and added it to the website: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/integrations/angular-credit-card\n. Note, there's a bug right now that's making this not work quite right, but hopefully that'll be resolved soon.\n. Could you give me a better example? I (and many others) are shipping projects that use field groups and uglify our code when we ship it. My guess is that your issues are not related to angular-formly, but maybe how you're using it (for example, you may be specifying a custom controller that's not properly annotated).\n. That sounds about right. So that solves your problem right? Please close this issue if so.\n. Closing this issue. The issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests.

Yes, I believe what you're suggesting is the correct fix to the bug. Thanks for spending the time digging into this. I think you have a good idea for the fix. Do you fancy creating some tests for the bug and fixing the issue? Would probably go somewhere in here. (Notice that even though the tests are run with angular 1.4, you can force formly-custom-validation to use parsers anyway with use-parsers).\n. No, that code lives in master so you shouldn't have any merge conflicts. And it was additive so I wouldn't expect any issues with it.\n. Sorry about that, but congrats on the upgrade! There are a lot of really cool features in 1.3 (here are some) :-)\nThanks for the code. I think I may just implement this as a bugfix. Unless you (or anyone watching) can think of a reason it shouldn't be...\n. Good point. A diagram would probably be helpful. I'll give it some thought.\n. I'm going to consider this one a breaking change. Even though it may be easy to think of it as a bugfix, it definitely changes behavior and so I'll include it in the 7.0.0 milestone. I'm hoping to give that milestone an entire day to work on it. I may develop this functionality as a formlyConfig.extras property which you can enable and then remove the original functionality when 7.0.0 hits...\n. I'm not 100% certain that this is correct... After looking at it, I think there's a problem. Particularly with this line:\njavascript\nctrl.$modelValue = viewValue;\nand this line:\njavascript\nreturn ctrl.$modelValue;\nI found that the later prevented other async validators from starting which I don't believe is the correct behavior, and the former doesn't take parsers into account. I'm going to go ahead and close this because you've moved on to Angular 1.3, nobody else has complained, and I'm dropping 1.2 support in the next major release (not the one I'm doing in a few minutes, but the one after that).\nFor anyone else, feel free to resurrect this if need be.\n.

The best way to get help is to follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nThe github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. The core of angular-formly has nothing to do with the templates/types that are used to create the form. For example, angular-formly itself knows nothing about an input element. This has been delegated to the end developer to tell formly about the different types that you'll be using in your application. To learn about how to do this, see the \"Custom Templates\" video here.\nThis, however is out of the scope of the angular-formly core library and therefore cannot be a feature request for this repository. You could however request an example for the website.\nGood luck! :+1: \n. I think that I'll start with a deprecation notice for this one. Then in 7.0.0, I'll rip it out altogether.\n. Love this. Would love some feedback from people on this one.\n. You might have to re-open this one... I can't seem to find it... \ud83d\ude1c #seewhatididthere?\n. This comment is no longer relevant.\n. Alright, I think there's enough support for this issue that I've added the intent to implement and up-for-grabs labels :+1: \n. This has been released in 6.22.0! Thanks for the suggestion @TheMcMurder :-)\n. @alxvallejo, agreed. Perhaps someone (you) would like to write a plugin to keep all that common code :-)\n. Hi @Astray-git, thanks for using angular-formly. This is actually not a bug, but a performance optimization that angular-formly makes for you. To indicate to angular-formly that you wish to change the property, you need to use expressionProperties. Here's a working example of your issue: https://jsbin.com/qijuwe/edit?html,js,output\nGood luck!\n. This may require a breaking change...\n. Just for context... runExpressions is a function that's added to all of your fields which is in charge of running all of your expressionProperties. You can invoke it yourself, but most of the time it's just invoked by the parent formlyForm (here).\nBecause expressionProperties require the $viewValue and the $modelValue, I remember having trouble with getting those values at the time I was developing it. Wrapping the function in a $timeout seemed to fix the problem. However, things have changed and it may not be necessary to do this anymore. I'm crossing my fingers.\nIf it is still necessary to execute expressionProperties on the \"next tick\" of the event loop, the next best thing I could do is replace $timeout with setTimeout. Right now, every one of your expressionProperties causes a $digest to fire because it's using $timeout. This is a major performance drag. However, if I switch to setTimeout then I fear that we may have a situation where things don't get updated as you would expect and you'd have to invoke $digest yourself (I don't want to force you to do this). This is why I would release this in a beta and ask that a lot of people please upgrade to try it out in your apps.\nFeedback is appreciated.\n. Oh! Yeah! Why didn't I think of that earlier. Thanks for the tip. That's probably exactly what I need.\n. Sorry, somehow this slipped through the cracks for me. I want to avoid doing too much different from the angular implementation of how to treat the model. Fewer surprises, more consistency. As a side, I actually disagree with you and I believe that the clearing of the model is appropriate.\nOn the subject of select onChange, I haven't seen what you're experiencing. Could you create an example and file a bug if you feel there is one?\n. Yeah, it didn't really work out well for me either. I'll release a bugfix version with the removed file.\n. The file has been removed in 6.21.1. Thanks for letting me know.\n. Hi @sharpmachine! Thanks for using angular-formly.

So I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. As before this one is for first-timers-only.

I'll hold your hand through this if you need me to. :-) Here are the steps to get a PR merged here.\n- [x] Watch this video to learn what you need to do to get things setup\n- [x] Go to this test and change describe.skip to describe.only\n- [x] Run $ npm test\n- [x] Notice that it's failing\n- [x] Go to this line. This is where formly decides which instance of apiCheck to use to issue the warning. We need to tell formly to default to the field's instance (the one that's passed in and is called apiCheckInstance), then the formlyConfig.extras.apiCheckInstance, then the formlyApiCheck instance. Right now it's missing the formlyConfig.extras.apiCheckInstance. I would just add it as another || between the first and second one on the same line.\n- [x] Update the eslint comment here to allow for a complexity of 9 (instead of 8) because you're adding another branch of complexity. Don't worry, it's covered, and I think that the code is fairly easy to understand. If you want, you could refactor it to make it even better.\n- [x] Once the test is passing, change the describe.only to describe so all the tests run.\n- [x] Make sure that all the tests pass\n- [x] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #343 (note it may take a second... it runs all the tests...)\n- [x] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR, get merged, celebrate \ud83c\udf89\nI'm happy to hold your hand through this if you need help. Catch me on gitter.\n. Thanks @bmacheski!\n. This has been released in angular-formly@6.23.0 :-)\n. Sorry this took so long for me to get back to you. Work's been crazy. So, I realized late that this would actually break anyone who's using the formly-field directly. Even though technically the formly-field directive is internal, I know that I'm using it and I'm sure others are as well, so I'd prefer not to break it.\nDo you think you'd have time to work in just one more piece to this PR? I'd like a test that's something like this pseudo code to pass:\njavascript\nit(`should add the model watcher when it's not the direct child of a formly-form`, function() {\n  const someExpressionProperty = sinon.spy();\n  compileAndDigest('<div formly-field class=\"formly-field\" options=\"field\" model=\"field.model\"></div>');\n  scope.field.model.foo = 'hello';\n  scope.$digest();\n  $timeout.flush();\n  expect(someExpressionProperty).to.have.been.calledOnce;\n});\nThat's not complete, but hopefully you get the idea. I would expect the implementation of it would simply check the parent element (probably in the link function because I'd prefer to avoid injecting $element into the controller) and if it's not a formly-form, then add the watch as it was before.\nSorry this has been such a long-lived PR. Thanks a ton for your work on it!\n. I could see an edge case where this could be nested inside a formly-form (as a field template) and that would be a problem. But that's definitely an edge case and I don't think we need to consider that. Thanks for working on this!\n. I'll release this tomorrow. I try to limit my coding on Sundays. Thanks!\n. Turns out this is only possible if you specify an ID for all the fields. Most people aren't doing this. If you are doing this, then I recommend that you specify track-by as an attribute.\n.

If you need help, follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. I think the issue you're seeing isn't an issue with formly, but with the part that displays the model. See here.\n. Did this resolve your issue? Please close if so.\n. Here's what I'd recommend: https://jsbin.com/wibado/edit?html,js,console,output\nWill that do it for you?\nEither way, this could be helpful. If you want to make a PR, we can take a look at the amount of complexity it adds to angular-formly. I'm fairly confident I'd accept a PR for this though. Thanks!\n. Here's a good workaround: https://jsbin.com/wibado/edit?html,js,console,output\n. :+1: \n. This actually would probably be a good first-timers-only issue. Maybe I'll work on adding some tests sometime. Until then, feel free to submit a PR if you want. Should be pretty simple.\n. Hi @marcoriesco, thanks for using angular-formly. I'm not certain that I understand the problem you're having. If you could be a little more clear that would be helpful. Some reproduction steps in the jsbin you created would be helpful.\nEither way, the github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. Need to add skipNgModelAttrsManipulator here\n. Awesome. Took me a while to figure out what on earth you were doing with the tests. But I think they're good. :+1: Just add that comment and I'll merge this and release it\n. Released as 6.23.2. Thanks a ton @koenweyn :-)\n\nOur resident IE8 support expert @koenweyn caught it and PRed a fix.\n\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#6232\n. Just found out that these tests are actually failing. For some reason, the SnapCI build is still passing. Not sure what's going on here. If you have any idea, would love help there.\n. Fixed it. Was a simple logic issue. You'll see my commit soon. Thanks.\n. Yeah, it's odd that it didn't... I should probably look into that as well...\n. I'm thinking that @benoror's betterNpmScripts isn't propagating failures for some weird reason... I think I need to come up with an alternative solution or something... Ah well...\n. Thanks for setting this up @koenweyn!\nHere's another first-timers-only issue! I will only accept a PR from someone who's never contributed to an open source project before!\nI'll hold your hand through this so you can get your first PR into a real open source project! Your goal is to make this test pass. Here are some steps:\n- [ ] Watch this video to learn what you need to do to get things setup\n- [ ] Go to this test and change it.skip to it.only\n- [ ] Run $ npm test\n- [ ] Notice that it's failing\n- [ ] Go to this function. This is where angular-formly applies the formatters from the field options to the $formatters of the NgModelController. Look at the code sample that @koenweyn suggests in the comment above. You'll do something similar. You'll get ctrl from scope.fc.\n- [ ] Once the test is passing, change the it.only to it so all the tests run.\n- [ ] Make sure that all the tests pass\n- [ ] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #423 (this issue) in your commit message (note it may take a second... it runs all the tests...)\n- [ ] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR with the description mentioning issue #423 (this issue), get merged, celebrate \ud83c\udf89\nCatch me on gitter if you need help!\n. Yeah, that's totally fine. There's been plenty of time for a first timer to grab this if they wanted to. There will other opportunities.\n. Ah! Yes, thank you @redhead, this is indeed implemented.\n. Thanks a ton for doing this @koenweyn! This is super cool! If you could just address the one thing that I mentioned then I think we're good.\n. Thanks a ton!\n. This is definitely possible and many people do it. Here's an example: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/json-powered\nI'm going to go ahead and close this issue. The github issues are reserved for feature requests and bug reports. If you need help, follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for looking into this. My first impression is that this would add quite a bit of complexity to the codebase. That's fine, but I want to make sure that the complexity is worth it. Do you think you could produce an example that demonstrates the perf bottleneck?\nMaybe I'm mistaken and this wont actually make things more complex...\n. I'm still not 100% sure this is good from a simplicity standpoint. Feel free to create a PR. That might help me visualize exactly what the API and the code changes involved would look like. But just know that I'm not certain whether I'd accept it.\nI really appreciate your contributions! Thank you for your work!\n. I think that would be better. The thing I don't like about what you were originally suggesting is that we're creating our own magic DSL by having '.something' have special meaning. I would prefer it if there were a little less angular-formly-specific magic going on, and it was easier to understand what's happening. By doing what you've just suggested, I think that would be much better.\n. Here's a solution using formState: https://jsbin.com/gokonaq/edit?js,output\n. Hi @setakhero, thanks for using angular-formly! The problem is that you need to define a datepicker type yourself. I recommend that you watch the videos here: http://learn.angular-formly.com to familiarize yourself with how angular-formly works.\nThe issues on this github repo are reserved for bug reports and feature requests. If you need help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com. Good luck! I'm going to close this issue. See you in the chat! Thanks again.\n. Note, this doesn't handle the multiple ng-model case. If you want to implement that, that would be great.\n. Looks like another case where angular-formly abstracts away complexity/broken parts from angular's built-in forms. Thanks!\n. Hi @SupriyaVenkatesh. Your question is related to how to work with ui date-picker, not angular-formly. I recommend you direct your question to them. Also, as I believe you are aware, the github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests. If you need help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for letting me know! @TheMcMurder's fix is in release 6.23.5\n. Turns out that there's still an issue with setting the form to $dirty. @TheMcMurder is working on a fix now.\n. Ah, now I see. Do we need to consider the common case for formState as well? Someone could say the model is formState.foo or something and we're already watching formState. We could do that in a separate PR or we could add that to this one. Either way, I like this and I think it enhances formly while keeping the external API unchanged. \ud83d\udc4d\n. @redhead, thanks so much for working on this. I really appreciate you taking the time to invest in the project \ud83c\udf1f gold star for you!\n. This is super awesome! The one thing left I just realized is the case for model['some-crazy-key'], but I think we can address that later. Thanks for working on this @redhead. I'll get it in and released now!\n. Released as 6.23.7\n. Will do. Thanks!\n. Hi @irhabi. Please see this example. Also, from README:\n\nPlease don't file an issue unless you feel like you've found a bug or have a feature request. Instead, go to help.angular-formly.com and follow the instructions.\n\nSo I'm going to close this issue.\n. This appears to work just fine for me: http://jsbin.com/fowufo/edit?html,js,output\n. I'm not certain I understand what you mean, but if you want to completely workaround the autocomplete by Chrome, take a look at the extras for formlyConfig. Specifically the removeChromeAutoComplete property.\nIf that's not sufficient, could you please describe exactly what the problem is? Thanks.\n. Yeah, I don't think there's really anything that angular or angular-formly could do for you. If you have any specific ideas or fixes, I'm open to hearing them, but I'm going to go ahead and close this one as out of scope. Good luck!\n. Instead of putting templateOptions.onChange in expressionProperties, put onChange in templateOptions. It's similar to this example\nNote, from the README:\n\nPlease don't file an issue unless you feel like you've found a bug or have a feature request. Instead, go to help.angular-formly.com and follow the instructions.\n\nSo I'm going to go ahead and close this. Thanks.\n. Yes, look into ngModelOptions.

Hmmm... When in angular 1.2, angular-formly uses the$parsersapi to do validation (standard way to do validation in 1.2). I think this is happening because angular 1.2 doesn't re-run the parsers when the model is changed programmatically (as it is in your example). So you're going to have to figure out a way to trigger the parsers to re-run whenever you change the model programmatically. You might consider looking into thewatchers` property to do this.\nLet me know if you think there's something that we can do in angular-formly core to make this easier for you and we can talk about it. Otherwise I'm going to close this as a wont-fix. Good luck!\n. Hmmm... If you can come up with a consistent way to update the validity properly, then perhaps I can find a good way to integrate that solution into formly core (or I'd happily accept a PR).\n. Fantastic! Thanks for writing this up! I hope you don't mind iterating on this a little bit. I have a comment or two. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Thank you so much for working on this :+1: This is definitely needed!\n. Nope! It's perfect! Thanks!\n. Also, this: http://beletsky.net/2015/04/npm-for-everything.html\n. @ckniffen, how does the work-around not work for you?\n. I'm wanting to automate releases using semantic-release. Currently, semantic-release doesn't push the built changes to the git repo (https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/75). I bet I could finagle something to get it to work, but it's just extra complexity and time spent that I'd like to avoid if I can.\nThe process of a release before adding semantic-release was to do this basically:\n1. Make and commit the changes\n2. Manually update the changelog (which I've made mistakes on several times)\n3. Decide whether this is a breaking change, new feature, or a bugfix and bump the version accordingly\n4. Run the build, commit changes, tag the commit with the version, push to github, npm publish\nLuckily, I was able to make the third item be a single command, but what semantic-release gives me is it removes the last three steps and does all of those automatically. This saves me time and reduces human error.\nThat's why I want to use semantic-release. I want to drop bower because semantic-release doesn't work well with bower currently and I also would prefer if we all (as a frontend community) just use npm instead.\n. I should mention, I'm just testing the waters. I was at a 30% likelihood of actually going through with this when I filed the feedback issue.\n. This doesn't have to happen! I got it working :-)\n. I'm sorry I've been so silent on this. I haven't had a chance to give it a good look. Sorry! :-/ I'll try to give it a closer look soon!\n. Haha, and I have a day job :P thanks for understanding :-)\n. Finally getting a chance to look into this. And I don't think I'm seeing the problem that you are... Do you mind trimming the example down a little bit and giving step-by-step reproduction instructions?\n. ping?\n. I realized what the problem was when I saw #485. The solution is the same: http://plnkr.co/edit/0roe4DzhhkANhOdJxhoX?p=preview\n. I'm going to close this. Let me know if you need more help\n. Fantastic! Sorry it took so long for me to respond.\n. This is definitely a bug. I may make this a first-timers-only issue. If someone else would like to write skipped tests to reproduce this issue, that would be awesome :-)\n. Hi @dannycallaghan! Thanks for doing this!\nIgnore the snap build. I just deleted it. We're now building with Travis. I need to add a check on travis that your commit message is correct.

I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. You should be able to do this already... http://angular-formly.com/#/example/advanced/custom-ids-and-names\n. Ah, I misunderstood your question. My apologies. That's exactly what I do as well. Thanks for your patience.\n. Note, that's not 100% what I do because I have situations where there are two of the same form for two different models in the same page at the same time. So that implementation would result in duplicate ids. So, instead, I simply use the model id as part of the field id.\n. Here's what mine looks like:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction azGetFieldId(options, model, scope) {\n  if (options.id) {\n    return options.id;\n  }\n  const index = getIndexOfIdInFields(options, scope);\n  return ['az-formly', getModelIdentifier(model), options.key, index].join('_');\n}\nfunction getModelIdentifier(model) {\n  let identifier = 'no-id';\n  if (model) {\n    const objectType = (model.constructor && model.constructor.name) || 'Object';\n    identifier = ${objectType}_${model.id || 'no-id'};\n  }\n  return identifier;\n}\n// sometimes you have two fields that use the same key. This ensures they don't have the same ID\nfunction getIndexOfIdInFields(options, scope) {\n  const fieldsWithTheSameKey = .filter(scope.fields, field => field.key === options.key);\n  return .indexOf(fieldsWithTheSameKey, options);\n}\n```\nResults in something like:\naz-formly_${objectType}_${id}_${propertyName}_${index}\nExamples:\naz-formly_User_123453523_username_0  // existing User\naz-formly_User_no-id_username_0      // new User\naz-formly_Object_no-id_someProp_0    // new Object\n. Looks awesome. Thanks a ton!\n. Man! I love this semantic-release thing. I don't even need to pull this. This fix will be released in a few minutes automagically :+1: \n. This is the problem... https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/11023\nPerhaps there's something we can do on the angular-formly side to make this easier (particularly for versions of angular where this PR wont make it). What do you think @ckniffen?\n. I feel like I've done that before and it worked out alright. We'd probably\nneed to add a watcher for the parent form's submitted state to call that.\nUnfortunately, there's no way to detect whether this watcher is necessary\n(most of the time it won't be), so we'd want it to be opt-in... The more I\nthink about it, the more I think it should probably be a plugin...\n- Kent C.

And that @BarryThePenguin for helping get this set up.\n. You might consider creating a custom directive that wraps this one and uses ng-model. The problem is, without ng-model, then formControl wouldn't really make sense. It would technically not be a formControl. One thing you might try is to simply add an ng-model on it and see what happens... Either way, this particular directive is doing it wrong. They should use ng-model.

Good luck!\n. Looks like ui-select isn't ready for angular 1.4.x yet. I've downgraded that example's angular to 1.3.19 and it's working great. Thanks for letting me know!\n. 140-500 fields is not large-ish. That's plain gigantic. I don't know what kind of user experience you're looking for, but I don't think that formly (or angular for that matter) can help you with the performance in that scenario. Out of curiosity, what version of angular and angular-formly are you using?\n. The problem is that you need all of those event listeners and watchers for your form to work properly.\nI would recommend:\n1. Upgrading to the latest angular-formly (there have been some significant performance optimizations made recently)\n2. Upgrading to the latest version of angular (though this can be more difficult if other dependencies you have aren't ready for it).\n3. Make sure you disable api-check in production as described in the tips\n4. Try showing only pieces of the form at a time, hide the rest of it behind an ng-if which will cause the form to not render until it's shown.\nI hope these tips help!\n. Good luck! Sorry the tech doesn't quite do what you were looking for in the first place :-/\n. Thanks @msc654! That is correct. That would be the proper way to do this.

I can't promise that I'll be available all day, but should be able to help most of the day.\nI'll get a few issues set up. At a high level, here are some things that I'd like:\n- Investigate an Angular 2 version (for the more ambitious of contributors)\n- Increase Test Coverage (both in the main repo and in the bootstrap templates)\n- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize for them <-- this one's really needed (and also for the more ambitious contributors)\n- Resolve existing issues\n- Record screencasts of features, write blogposts/tutorials, improve documentation, etc.\n- Write plugins for common use-cases (see below)\n  - ng-messages integration\n  - Repeating sections\n  - Angular Material\n  - JSON Schema support\n  - Additional types for bootstrap that integrates with angular-ui-bootstrap\n  - Other ideas here\nIf you're interested in writing a plugin, please see this spreadsheet to look at some of the ideas and sign up for what you're interested in working on.\nI've recorded a screencast explaining some of these things a bit if you like to watch, check it out here.\nAlso, if you're just getting started contributing to angular-formly, I just recorded a new screencast with instructions on how to contribute. Here it is. Note, I'm afraid I'm a bit long-winded in that one. You might also benefit from the original (albeit a tad out-dated).\nAs always, please check the project's CONTRIBUTING.md and make sure to follow the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\nThanks for your help!!!\n. Nothing official. Just stuff in the examples page.\n. Hey, I had three family things come up for this weekend so I'm going to have to push this back two weeks. Is it alright if we move it to the 24th?\n. Thanks for letting me know! I've fixed it.\n. I know what the problem is. When the form is rendered, angular-formly will look through the given fields and set up $watchers with them. But angular-formly doesn't watch your fields after that point. So when you change them or anything, that initialization step doesn't run for those new fields.\nOne solution to this is to prevent the form from being rendered until the fields are available, like so: http://jsbin.com/fudufaj/edit?html,js,console,output\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this. If you need more help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nIf this doesn't actually solve the problem, let me know. Thanks!\n. @benoror, could you fix that example?\n. I agree. Adding wrappers support to fieldGroup would be a neat feature. I'll add that as a label and add up-for-grabs to invite people to contribute :-)\n. Answered here. The GitHub issues in this project are reserved for reporting bugs and feature requests. In the future, please follow the instructions here to get help: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. You're good. You thought it was a feature request. No harm done :-) Good luck!\n. Awe, you're making me :blush: Thanks!\n. Hmmm... Yeah, if it's only happening locally I'm afraid there's not much I can do to help you :-(\n. Neat! Almost perfect. This just needs to be added to dependencies rather than devDependencies :-)\n. Also, I think there's something wrong with the build. Don't worry about it. I'll give  it a look\n. Be sure to comment when you've finished that. I wont be notified when you push changes.\n. Ah... Hmmm... You know what... I think I'd be alright with that if we could replace some of the other util methods of formly with lodash ones...\n. Hmmm... Yeah, I'm going to say that it's not worth it :-( Thanks anyway!\n. Could you please reproduce this issue here? http://issue.angular-formly.com/\n. Try this instead: http://jsbin.com/bogewe/edit?html,js,output\nBecause this is more of a question than a bug or a feature request, I'm going to close the issue. Please take this to the chat or stack overflow if you have further questions. Good luck!\n. Yeah, you definitely want to avoid anything that has to do with $broadcast :-)\n. I'm not sure I understand the problems with the current implementation. What do you mean by:\n\ninstead of much much later where we are forced to use setViewValue and setPristine and other workarounds so the formatters work?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean...\n. Oh, I think I see what you're saying. So by adding the parsers and formatters after the ng-model has been initialized, they don't run and we have to manually run them. So what you're suggesting is we have another directive and add them to the ngModelController as you would normally. We do this same thing with validators with the formly-custom-validation directive. We could do something similar with a formly-parsers-and-formatters directive... I think that would make the most sense and clean up some code too...\n. Yes, this is a bug. Feel free to makeapullrequest.com\n. You got it :-) https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#watch-the-videos\n. This isn't an angular-formly issue, it's actually an angular issue. The problem is that without the name attribute, there's absolutely no way for me to get access to the ng-model controller. One thing you might consider is creating a directive which requires the ngModel controller and then attaches it to scope.options.\nGive me a second and I think I could give you a quick example.\n. Here you go! http://jsbin.com/mebiju/edit?html,js,output\nBecause this isn't something that we'll be implementing in the core of angular-formly, I'll close this issue. However, if you like to make a plugin for formly, that'd be way cool!\n. Awesome! If you want a good kick-start on building an open source library, I recommend you checkout my egghead.io series :-)\n. :blush: yay!\n. Hi @Rorkal,\nI'm sorry that nobody's gotten to you until now.

As it is an enhancement request for an existing example.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/507#issuecomment-150872510\n.\n\n\nKent C. Dodds https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\n. It's not available in the repository. We're using publish-latest which pushes the releases to the latest branch (more info).\n\n\nIn any case, publish-latest had a problem and that's why the last release didn't work out. This has been resolved and a new release is being published as we speak :-)\n. This should be relatively easy to fix. Mind submitting a PR?\n. Sorry, by PR I meant Pull Request. Occasionally I'll reserve issues for first timers only would you like me to reserve this one for you and help you know what to do?\n. Awesome! I love the initiative! I'll get a test written for you as soon as possible (probably tomorrow hopefully)\n. Hey @chrisheninger! Have at it! Here are the tests.\nThis line and this line need to take an array of scope.fcs into account. I recommend you utilize the arrayify method (which you have access to in the scope of that function) which will take an argument and convert it to an array if it's not already one. Then call something like this on it: .some(f => f.$invalid); (or $touched for the other case).\nOne thing I just realized my test case doesn't cover is this line and this line. If you want to take a whack at writing tests for those scenarios too that'd be cool, otherwise let me know and I'll write up tests for those next time I get a chance. Good luck!!!\n. I've added a few more tests, but it still doesn't cover everything. I'll be honest, this one's a bit more complex. Don't feel bad if you have a hard time with the implementation.\n. Let's hold on the PR  now and get this all done in one. I'll give your commits a closer look tomorrow. I'm glad this is a learning experience for you! That's the point :-)\n. Just looked at your implementation. Do fast, so good :+1:\n. Sorry, autocorrect... I'm meant \"So far, so good\"\n. The tests don't cover everything that needs to be covered. I'll try to get the remaining test or two written. But basically anything in that function that references scope.fc needs to handle situations where scope.fc is an array.\n. Looks pretty solid. I'll need to get to a computer to work out helping with that last test. Thank you very much!\n. @bjspencer, looking at your solution I think that it's better than what I was planning on. So you'll want to change the test that you have skipped. Instead of\njavascript\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.calledWith(sinon.match.array, sinon.match.array)\nDo:\njavascript\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.calledTwice // once for each form control.\nThat should do it :-) Then make a PR and I'll merge it :D\n. @bjspencer's PR #553 just got merged. A new release will be pushed out automatically in a few moments :+1: \n. Please try it out and report back if it's not behaving as you expect. Until then, I'm closing this. Thanks @bjspencer and @chrisheninger!\n. Have you tried providing a function to errorExistsAndShouldBeVisibleExpression rather than simply a string? :-)\n. I think that really depends on your use case. For example, what do you want to have it do when two of the fields have required in their $error? Show two? Show one? Either way, I think you might be able to have a function you call to get the $error object rather than simply referencing it there... Just really depends on your specific use case I think.\n. We could probably cache this. Where did you see that it can take upwards of a couple of seconds?\n. Wow, this is great. Thank you!\n. Thanks for your help and kind words @dannycallaghan :-)\nNote, if all you want to do is override the template and add a controller you could define a new type that extends the input type, like so:\n``` javascript\nformlyConfigProvider.setType({\n    extends: 'input',\n    name: 'myInput',\n    template: require('YOUR_INPUT_TEMPLATE.html'),\n    // don't need a wrapper because it will inherit that from the input type \n    controller: ['$scope', function ($scope) {\n        if ($scope.to.type && $scope.to.type === 'date') {\n            /* \n            Do your stuff here, something like:\n        var currentModelVal = $scope.model[$scope.options.key];\n        if (typeof (currentModelVal) === 'string'){\n            $scope.model[$scope.options.key] = new Date(currentModelVal);\n        }\n        */\n    }\n}]\n\n});\n```\n.

I'm here to help!\nAlso, don't feel bad that the issue itself is small. The goal of first-timers-only is more to get you acquainted with the process of contributing than it is to figure out how to implement something cool. The process of getting your first contribution is the hard part. You can figure out implementation details once you've nailed down the contributing piece :-) Good luck!\n. Almost perfect @julianaramburu! The convention requires a : between the scope and the subject. And it also requires blank lines between the subject and the related issues.

Also, here's a jsbin with the working version. Notice that it references v7.1.2 explicitly.\n. I think I'll give this one a look.\n. Here's the original reproduction steps @isaac-l gave the other day\n\nIs there a known issue with http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/matching-two-fields ? As far as I can tell, it doesn't work as expected\nFor example:\n1. Set email to a@b.c\n2. Set confirm to a@b.cd (Causes validation error as expected)\n3. Set email to a@b.cd (Should be valid, but still shows a validation error)\nLikewise, setting valid values then changing Email doesn't cause validation to fail\n. Try this. Add the validateOnModelChange extra to both fields. Then add the allowInvalid ng-model-option to both as well.\n\nThe issue is that when the value is invalid, the model value will be undefined, so by doing allowInvalid it will update the model value even when it's invalid. This means that your validator will be able to know what the value of the other field is.\n. Feedback:\n1. Looks good\n2. Don't use _angularFix2['default'] because that's the transpiled code, just use angular and babel will take care of the rest\nFeel free to open a PR.\n. :+1: @gillchristian!\n. This should totally work. Could you follow the instructions here to give a reproducible example? http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Hi @iJungleboy, this is totally possible with angular-formly, so I'm going to assume that you just need help getting things set up.

See you on chat!\n. If you take a look at how onChange is called, you'll see why you're experiencing this. It's called with: model[options.key], options, this, $event which is roughly equivalent to: $modelValue, options, scope, $event. If you want the $viewValue, then you can get it from scope.fc.$viewValue.\nI'm going to close this issue because issues on this repo are reserved for big reports and feature requests. If you need more help, go to http://help.angular-formly.com\nAlso, what language is that code you showed? It's not JavaScript and it looks unlike any CoffeeScript I've ever seen...\n.

Yeah, but api-check isn't part of Angular at all. Think of it like jQuery or lodash. Order matters.\n. Thanks for the issue and the diff. I'm mostly concerned with the comment // Avoid flicker when hideExpression promises resolve to true... I feel like setting field.hide = true would cause a flicker if the field is not hidden and the promise resolves to false...\nMy inclination is to not do this and instead have you use a work-around for this. Perhaps something like this: https://jsbin.com/pepode/edit?html,js,output\nIf this is sufficient for you, please close this issue. If not, maybe there's another way. Thanks!\n. I see, it seems like your use case is quite specific. I would actually recommend that you use a router like ui-router or ng-router and utilize the resolve functionality to resolve that asynchronous logic into your controller (so your controller isn't even loaded until that request has finished) and then you'll be able to simply assign the result to the hide property making your controller much easier to understand/maintain/etc.\nEither way, the flicker would be a problem for anyone who has the hide property being dynamic as the user interacts with the form and I can't do that to the rest of the users.\nSomething else you could do is put this particular field into its own form hidden behind an ng-if and do the async stuff outside of formly entirely.\nEither way, I don't think we'll be adding this to formly. If you need more help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Will do, thanks for the suggestion! And thanks for using formly :-)\n. There is not. This has been asked for quite a bit. My guess is you want to know when it's done rendering because it's taking a long time to render. Please make sure that you're following the production tips to make sure that you disable some of the developer related things which should speed things up quite a bit for you. After that, you'll just have to make sure that your design is conducive to a performant form.\n. No plans, sorry\n. Good find. Here's the line of code that causes the problem. What do you think we could/should do about it? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/src/directives/formly-form.js#L293\n. I don't know if that would actually work... I don't think you can use $parse in a string expression like that.  Honestly, I think this is sort of an edge case and unless we can accomplish a solution that avoids the following two issues, I don't want to worry about it:\n1. It adds complexity to the codebase\n2. It reduces performance for the common case\nI don't know if there's a satisfactory way to accomplish both of those for this case.\n. I think that's acceptable.

Thanks for seeing that @pdemilly! @shealan, I highly recommend you look into ng-annotate to avoid problems like this.\n.

I hate to do this to you but do you think you could submit it one more time? We release angular-formly automatically using semantic-release which requires certain conventions for commit messages. See Pull Requests in CONTRIBUTING.md to learn about that.\nFor this change, a good commit message would be:\n```\nfix(formlyValidationMessages): handly falsy values\nThis should fix setting {min: 0} in field templateOptions to return proper message\n```\nThanks for your patience and your contribution! :smile: \n. It's perfect! Thanks for contributing! I'll merge this and it'll be automagically released soon :-)\n. My guess is that this is an odd behavior with how ui-bootstrap deals with focus for modals. Here's a solution that uses expressionProperties which will set the focus value after the form is initially digested: https://jsbin.com/qanumi/1/edit?html,js,output\n. This should be possible. But probably not easy. Feel free to submit a PR.\n. Yeah, parseGet is to allow for nested keys, like: name.first, so it's using the $parse service. My guess in the $parse service doesn't like a preceding number in a property getter or something. @MCKRUZ, do you think you could look into this?\n. I think that if the model is already an array, then angular will treat it like an array. Otherwise (if it's an object or undefined) angular will make it an object and set the property there. @dannycallaghan can you try initializing your model to an object and seeing if that works?\n. Actually... Yeah, that wont work... Nevermind...\n@MCKRUZ, I think that your solution should work pretty well. Just make sure to write/run tests and check the code coverage report generated in the coverage/lcov-report folder to make sure you're covering what you think you are :-) Thanks!\n. All the thanks is to @MCKRUZ on this one. I just clicked the merge button.\n. Yep, that's latest. @dannycallaghan, do you fancy making a pull request to add skipped test cases for your keys?\n. What if we changed it to:\n``` javascript\nfunction shouldNotUseParse(key) {\n  return angular.isNumber(key) || !containsSelector(string)\n}\n// maybe we should put these in formlyUtils...\nfunction containsSelector(string) {\n  return contains(string, '.') || (contains(string, '[') && contains(string, ']'))\n}\nfunction contains(a, b) {\n  if (!a || !a.indexOf) {\n    return false\n  }\n  return a.indexOf(b) !== -1\n}\n```\nWhat do you think?\n. Guessing it's been resolved.\n. You'll have to write custom code to track whether the current value is equal to the initial value. angular-formly adds an initialValue to all of your field's options (angular-formly uses it to reset the form). You could use that to determine the changed state of a given field. A function like this would do it for you:\njavascript\nfunction fieldHasChanged(field) {\n  return field.formControl.$modelValue !== field.initialValue\n}\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Thank you!!! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf8a\n. Hi @david-nelson-moscow, I don't personally have any plans to work on an Angular 2 version of angular-formly. That (of course) does not preclude anyone else from working on it.\nOriginally I had planned on making an Angular 2 version of angular-formly. However with so many things competing for my time, I can't justify spending time on it. I was able to justify working on angular-formly before because I was using it at work and I used Angular heavily. But I will soon be changing jobs and will be using React. So I no longer have a use case for angular-formly.\nPerhaps someone on the @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read team will be up to the challenge.\nThanks for asking!\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Fantastic. Thanks for working on this! Merging.\nAs a friendly reminder, the issue number should be at the bottom of the commit per our commit convention guidelines. So this one should be:\n```\nfix(formly-field): Add better detection of nested keys\nCloses #566\n``\n. Thanks again!\n.resetModelshould update those values. Could you please reproduce your issue using [issue.angular-formly.com](http://issue.angular-formly.com/)? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. Looks like after we callresetModelon all the individual fields ([right here](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/917ec263ddcc4902fa2cb9dc167da0734f9d5ed6/src/directives/formly-form.js#L207-L215)) we need to set the form'stouchedandpristine` state like we do with the individual fields (here).\nI'm open to a pull request for this! Anyone's welcome to try. Just follow these instructions\n. This issue should be closed I think. Let me know if you experience otherwise!\n. @janneman001 could you provide an example of this behavior?\n. Here you can use this as a starter, then just post the link in here :+1: \n. In the last major version expression was changed to statement. Here's a working example:\nhttps://jsbin.com/purobo/edit?js,console,output\n. I've updated the example. Thanks!\n. Thank you! :-) this should be released automatically in a few minutes.\n. Looks like somehow I forgot to add the webpack Uglify plugin to the webpack config when I changed some stuff. If someone would like to PR it I'll merge when I land :airplane: :-)\n. Hi @benoror, the uglify loader actually has some problems with it. We should actually remove it from the devDependencies. We should instead use the Uglify Plugin\n. Thanks @benoror! :+1: \n. Actually, sorry, could you make this a fix rather than a chore? That way we get an automatic release\n. Fantastic. Thank you!\n. Dying is probably the more appropriate term: https://gofore.com/ohjelmistokehitys/stop-using-bower/\n. Actually, you don't need to use browserify, webpack or any other module packager even if you use npm. You can just reference the built files just as you would without those tools. Most packages distribute a stand-alone distributable that works in the browser (like angular-formly).\nAs for the location of the installed files, as long as they're listed in your package.json dependencies then they'll be in the root of node_modules (regardless of npm version). And if someone moves where the distributable file goes then that's a breaking change (and would happen with bower as well).\nSo, for example, for angular-formly, you could use npm by installing it like so:\nbash\n$ npm i angular-formly --save\nThen in an html file you could reference that like so:\nhtml\n<script src=\"node_modules/angular-formly/dist/formly.js\"></script>\nAnd that'd work just perfectly :-)\n. @dmitriz, I'm not sure I understand what you're describing, but if I had to guess, you're using npm in the wrong way.\n\nWhen you say \"as long as they're listed in your package.json dependencies\", do you mean -- before the installation?\n\nNo, they don't need to be there before installation. When you install the module explicitly (either from an npm install angular-formly or from having it in your package.json), it'll go in the root of your node_modules directory. \nNot sure what to tell you, but I'm pretty sure that you're not using npm correctly if you're experiencing that.\n. Yeah, generally every project that depends on npm or bower will have a package.json or bower.json (respectively) to list dependencies. Then all the dependencies for the project will be added to as a sibling directory to the package.json (in the case of npm) called node_modules. If you're wanting to spread node_modules directories all over your project, that's a pretty unconventional way to use npm.\n. I'm not sure what the webhook is for. This gulp task will run as part of our automated releases on travis. What's the purpose of the webhook?\n. Merged and webhook created. Let me know if you need anything else!\n. That's one way to do it. I'd welcome a PR to add that :-)\n. Sorry it took so long to get back! It'll be in attributeOnly because (as @SteveShaffer mentioned) there is no angular equivalent (like ng-step).\n. Hi @rayhooker. Thanks for the question. I actually just recently answered this on my AMA here. Let me know if you have further questions :-)\n. New release is out. But I guess it doesn't fix this issue still exists.\n. This looks pretty good. Please just use extras as I mention in the inline comment and I'd prefer that this new API is tested. Thanks!\n. P.S. Let me know when you update the PR (github wont notify me).\n. Thanks for doing this. The tests are great. I wonder if it might be easier if  manualModelWatcher could be a string or function itself. This way you could have a single watcher that applies to all fields. I feel like this could accomplish the need and we already have an API for specific watchers on fields.\n. With that, do we really need the extras watcher? We already have a mechanism for adding a watcher to a field... I'd rather avoid adding another way to do the same thing.\n. Right. What I'm saying is for that second bullet point, you can use the watcher property to add custom watchers. It basically does the same thing as the watch is extras\n. Sorry. I guess I didn't understand your problem well enough. I still think that it would be valuable to be able to disable the deep watch and provide a custom watch function for the whole form.\n. Ah, indeed... Hmmm.... I wonder if there's a way we could enhance the existing API to account for the use case\n. I like your first suggestion. I think that we could implement it in a backward compatible way and I don't think that it is terribly confusing:\njavascript\n{\n  ...\n  watcher: [{\n    expression: 'model.type',\n    runFieldExpressions: true,\n  }]\n},\n{\n  ...\n  watcher: [{\n    expression: 'model.type',\n    listener: () => {},\n    runFieldExpressions: true,\n  }]\n}\nI think that both of those would run the field expressions, but the second field would also run the custom listener.\nI really don't see anything bad with this approach. The idea is that it totally separates disabling deep model watching (or specifying custom watcher) from custom field watchers which I think is a good call.\n. That's probably a little bit too magical I think. Maybe if we added another property to options that was watchAllExpressions in addition to disableModelWatcher or something like that. I just want the API to describe what's going on.\n. Haven't looked at the code yet, but I can tell you right now that there's a reason that hideExpression isn't evaluated the same as expressionProperties and that's because a common scenario for the hide property. That is: If a field is initialized as hide: true, then it will not be compiled. Therefore there will be no scope to evaluated this expression and the field will never be shown (because the expression can't be evaluated).\nSo, if you could removed that piece, then I'll give the code a look. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks a ton!\n. If you wanted to fix the model property in those expressions, you could add to this object. Would require a breaking change though. Feel free to do that (though make sure your commit message follows the convention)\n. This is excellent @kwypchlo. Thank you. If you could address my one comment, I give this a :+1:. I would like someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators and another person from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read to also review this PR and give a :+1: or :-1:\n. Thanks @kamilkisiela! I'll go ahead and merge this in then.\n. This will be auto-released in a few minutes. Thanks a bunch @kwypchlo!\n. I'm not sure what's causing your issue. What version of node and npm are you using?\n. I'm sorry, I'm not able to reproduce your issue myself. One thing you might double check is that you've got the peerDependencies like angular and api-check installed before you try to install angular-formly.\n. Yes, this is totally possible and the way it should be done is with plugins of which there are several. I'm pretty confident that for the most part angular-formly is \"done.\" Any other functionality needed can/should probably be added via a plugin.\nFeel free to create a plugin yourself. It should be quite straightforward. For example, the Matching Two Fields example you reference could be made a plugin with a single file that does this:\n``` javascript\nangular\n  .module('angular-formly-match-field', [])\n  .config(function config(formlyConfigProvider) {\n    // set templates here\n    formlyConfigProvider.setType({\n      name: 'matchField',\n      defaultOptions: function matchFieldDefaultOptions(options) {\n        return {\n          extras: {\n            validateOnModelChange: true\n          },\n          expressionProperties: {\n            'templateOptions.disabled': function(viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n              var matchField = find(scope.fields, 'key', options.data.fieldToMatch);\n              if (!matchField) {\n                throw new Error('Could not find a field for the key ' + options.data.fieldToMatch);\n              }\n              var model = options.data.modelToMatch || scope.model;\n              var originalValue = model[options.data.fieldToMatch];\n              var invalidOriginal = matchField.formControl && matchField.formControl.$invalid;\n              return !originalValue || invalidOriginal;\n            }\n          },\n          validators: {\n            fieldMatch: {\n              expression: function(viewValue, modelValue, fieldScope) {\n                var value = modelValue || viewValue;\n                var model = options.data.modelToMatch || fieldScope.model;\n                return value === model[options.data.fieldToMatch];\n              },\n              message: options.data.matchFieldMessage || '\"Must match\"'\n            }\n          }\n        };\n    function find(array, prop, value) {\n      var foundItem;\n      array.some(function(item) {\n        if (item[prop] === value) {\n          foundItem = item;\n        }\n        return !!foundItem;\n      });\n      return foundItem;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n});\n```\nIf you're interested in creating this plugin, I recommend you check out my egghead.io series: How to Write an Open Source Library and look at the recommendations on the plugins page. Good luck!\n. @slavafomin, why can't you help? You're welcome to make a PR. Just make the test pass :-)\n. If you need help, I'm sure that someone (or I) could help point you in the right direction. You might also check the CONTRIBUTING.md :+1: \n. Just to clarify, this is intended to only run the hide expression right? Other expressionProperties won't work until the field itself is compiled.\n. Based on the test, I'm guessing that is the case. Thanks! \n. Yes, go to the link function where we're chaining the steps of the promises to compile the template and just add another step or add to an existing step\n. I really think that you could find another way to accomplish what you're trying to do. Could you create an example of what you're trying to do following these instructions?\nEither way, I don't think that we'll be doing anything significant to change the behavior of the ngModelAttrsTemplateManipulator and I'm sure that we can figure out another way to do what you're trying to do. So I'll go ahead and close this issue. Good luck!\n. Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is by following the instructions at help.angular-formly.com. The GitHub issues on this project are reserved for feature requests and bug reports, so I'm going to close this issue. See you on chat and Stack Overflow!\n. The examples seem to be working fine for me... Could you check them again?\n. Thanks @kamilkisiela! :D\n. @benoror looks like you updated the PR. Looks good to me. Anyone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read wanna review this and push the merge button?\n. Sorry, I just merged another PR :cry: \n. Sorry about that @benoror.\n. :clap: \n. Ah, yes, probably should.\n. Anyone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators wanna take this one? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/tree/master/app/states/root/children/users/components/data\n. :+1: even better! Thanks :D\n. Here are the GUI builders I'm aware of. Built by others: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/gui-form-builders\n. That's what they promise. If you have problems with them, contact their respective maintainers.\n. These are great questions for the chat: http://chat.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for the help @benoror.\nHmmm.... Yeah, I feel like this is a bit of an edge case and would prefer that it's handled outside of angular-formly unless I can see a simple, tested implementation. My inclination is to say this is outside of the scope of the project though. Sorry @koraybalci.\n. Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is by following the instructions at help.angular-formly.com. The GitHub issues on this project are reserved for feature requests and bug reports, so I'm going to close this issue. See you on chat and Stack Overflow!\n. Technically this should have almost everything that this has. I think the only thing that's missing is: originalModel, and formOptions. The other properties are actually properties on the $scope of the formly-form which is where the expression is evaluated and therefore you should have access to it in your expression.\nI'd happily accept a (tested) PR to add these properties. If you're keen on it, that's great. If you need help, maybe someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read could give you a little guidance. Thanks everyone!\n. Great, you might take a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md file as well :+1: \n. Yeah, originalModel can simply be: $scope.model (the form's $scope). formOptions will need to be $scope.options (the form's $scope)...\n. Yep! Feel free to close it. Thanks!\n. Feel free to makeapullrequest.com\n. Seems to be up for me and isitup.org https://isitup.org/docs.angular-formly.com\n. How's it looking for you now?\n. You're validator needs to check for empty and return valid if it's empty. The examples on the website do this. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. That's fine. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Mind adding a test or two that verifies these changes work (and to prevent them from breaking in the future?)\n. Sure! :+1: \nI'd probably put it in the section of tests that test hideExpression because that's one of the main places that leverages this feature. Find that here.\nI would take the existing beforeEach and two it blocks and nest them in another describe with a title of something like: behavior when the model changes\nThen I would create another describe block for your tests with the title of something like as a string. And then add an it with the message: should have access to almost all the same properties as an expressionProperties string expression.\nThen in your test, you'll want to initialize scope.fields, scope.model, and scope.options (scope.options should have a formState object). And for scope.fields you can use the getNewField helper function (see other places for how that's used. It's pretty much just a helper so you can omit the template/type/etc.).\nIt may be a bit tricky because you can't really do assertions in string expressions, but the returned value of the string expression is assigned to the field's hide property. So you might try something like this:\njavascript\nscope.model = {}\nscope.options = {formState: {}}\nscope.fields = [getNewField({\n  hideExpression: `\n    options === options.data.field &&\n    index === 0 &&\n    formState === options.data.formOptions.formState &&\n    originalModel === options.data.originalModel &&\n    formOptions === options.data.formOptions\n  `, // can't reliably test `formId` unfortunately\n  data: {\n    originalModel: scope.model,\n    formOptions: scope.options,\n  }\n})]\nscope.fields[0].data.field = scope.fields[0]\nThen invoke compileAndDigest and assert that the scopes.fields[0].hide is true.\nLet me know what you think or feel free to change whatever you like. Looking forward to seeing this. Thanks!\n. It's for anything you want. Because angular-formly validates all of the properties you provide, if you have any other things you need to provide, they either go in templateOptions (if it's specific for the template or type that you're using) or in data if it's just general data that you need to get your job done (like in this case).\n. I'm fine with either way. Feel free to add more tests in this pr, feel free to squash if you like.\n. If you could fix that comment and the name of that data property (to parentScope maybe), then this is great and I'll merge it. Thanks!\n. Perfect. Thank you!\n. If you're simply using the global, then rather than requiring it, it's available as a global apiCheck. Then you disable it the same as in the docs.\n. No, angular-formly uses it heavily. You definitely want to disable it for production. There's an example on the website for production tips that uses globals.\nI'm going to let you look at that and consider this issue closed. Check out the chat for more questions.\n. I'm sorry, but as you can see in the comments, I said I don't want to add another error message because it simply doesn't make sense to have two error messages for the same thing. The very next line is the same error. If you want to update that message, we can talk about that, but adding another message is something I simply won't do.\n. You can do it in your submit handler. The submit handler is on the same scope as the form options.\n. The GitHub issues on this repo are reserved for feature requests and bug reports. All questions should follow these instructions: help.angular-formly.com\nSo I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. The example is confusing, but it's definitely still working. Read the descriptions carefully. Sorry it's confusing.\n\n. Good luck! If you wanna create an example of what you're trying to do and share it in the chat or on stack overflow that'd probably help :-) help.angular-formly.com\n. I'm not certain I understand what you mean by this. Could you give a more clear explanation of what you mean?\n. Even better, maybe you could go to the chat and describe what you're trying to do. Perhaps someone will be able to help you find another way.\n. Could you please reproduce your issue using issue.angular-formly.com? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. > I can make this work with the current form by assigning both the form and the formly-form to the same property\nThis is how it's intended to work. You're basically passing the form to formly-form telling it what to use for the NgFormCtrl. Formly does some magic under the hood to manage the NgFormCtrl to make the API more clear. Unfortunately that leads to issues like the one you're seeing, but most of the time it's better than the alternative.\nI don't think there's anything I can do to fix this. Just name your form and pass it to formly-form.\n. Could you please reproduce your issue using issue.angular-formly.com? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. This appears to be a bug. defaultOptions should work great as a function. But it appears to not work in this case. However, if we make the abstractType an object instead, it seems to work fine (like so).\nI doubt that I'll have time to work on this I'm afraid. But feel free to makeapullrequest.com :-)\n. Thanks for letting me know! This should be fixed in a few minutes. Sorry about that!\n. Please re-open this if it's not fixed in 30 minutes.\n. Hey @johannesjo,\nI commented on your question on stack overflow.\nBecause the github issues on this project are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, I'm going to close this issue. If you have further questions, please take them to chat.angular-formly.com\n. I would personally say that it's out of scope for the core project. It would, however, make a great plugin. You might think about giving the repeating-section a look.\n. :+1:\n. I should also mention that managing this project is primarily a matter of support at this point. There are definitely some bugs and a few tiny features, but for the most part, this project is done.\n. Thanks for the suggestion @ShashankaNataraj. That currently exists (and invitations are still open #481). I'm looking for someone to hand off account information, passwords, tokens, etc. to.\n. If you're interested, I published a 3 minute podcast about this: https://www.briefs.fm/episodes/570\n. @jorgemarcondes fantastic. I'll add you to the collaborators on the org. Thanks!\n. Sweet @barkoczi, I'll add you to the collaborators.\n. Thanks @agileurbanite! I'll add you to the collaborators as well.\nFor everyone on @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read, you could really help out by investigating, reviewing, closing, and making PRs for the issues. Also, make sure to watch the repo, and the various formly-js repos as well.\nIf I see someone really taking initiative on the issues and things then I'll happily hand over write access and eventually publish access. Thanks!\n. @Stwissel, talk with @mohammedzamakhan about how you can help with https://github.com/formly-js/ng2-formly :-)\n. > I would hate to see formly go un-maintained.\nLikewise. I've stopped watching the repos because I can't really help out anymore. My plan was to hand over control to anyone making pull requests, but nobody has really done that consistently. This tells me that either nobody's willing to step up to the plate of ownership or angular-formly is done.\nI think at this point, @BarryThePenguin is probably the best candidate for ownership. What do you say @BarryThePenguin?\n. @sumitasr, I'll add you to the read-only collaborators. Start making PRs and I'll give you write access :)\n. I'm fairly confident that formly is still a prime solution for building forms with AngularJS. It's been steadily growing in the number of downloads since I posted this almost a year ago. Formly's not dead. But based on the fact that the library has had very little development (and no active maintainers), but still growing in popularity tells me that it's \"done.\"\nFormly is no more dead than AngularJS. It's just done.. Another interesting fact: angular-formly comes up (basically) first in pretty much every search criteria on npm for \"angular forms\": https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=angular%20forms\nI think it's safe to say that angular-formly is still the most popular abstraction for forms with angular.. @LuigiDAmico, from the README badge, you can see there are about 12,000 downloads on npm per month. It's extremely hard to tell from download numbers how many users there are. There are no active contributors or maintainers, so I've kept ownership of the project, but I don't watch the repo so I'm not sure how the community is doing (as far as people helping one another out or people finding the answers they need). If you want to contribute, please start helping out in the community.\nI think that the project is more-or-less \"done\" based on the fact that there are rarely new issues filed on the project and no critical issues and rarely any pull requests. It's helped tens (hundreds) of thousands of developers build better forms with AngularJS :). Hi @kwypchlo!\nThanks for making this. I'll review it more closely soon. But if you could double check the commit message conventions, I don't think this follows it. Also, pay close attention to what you need to do in the commit message if you're introducing a breaking change please. Thanks!\n. Awesome. Thanks for doing that! I'll get back to you soon hopefully!\n. I think this PR is great other than the one note that I mentioned. Let me know if you have questions about that.\n. Looks good to me! Thoughts @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read?\n. Hopefully the auto-release works for this one. We've had a bit of trouble with that recently.\n. Nope :-( #643 is tracking issues with the auto-release process...\n. Thanks a ton for the help @gillchristian! @vukan71, because this appears to be more of a matter of help and support than a real bug or feature request, I'm going to close this issue. Feel free to continue discussion or move this to chat.angular-formly.com :+1: \n. Looks good to me. But I would like someone else to merge this: @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators \n. Anyone in @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read who feels confident they can have commit access, I'll add you to @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators :-)\n. Unfortunately it looks like it's not fixed\n. Actually, it looks like this wasn't auto-released for some reason :-( Filing an issue.\n. Yeah, it hasn't yet been released because there's a problem. So no, there's not really a way... Feel free to help out here: #643\n. If I publish manually, will things go back to normal?\n. Alrighty, released 7.5.1. I'll merge #639 after I verify this is fixed with the new release.\n. Looks like bower's broken as well... I'm actually tempted to stop officially supporting bower and direct people to the solution in #589 with npmcdn.com\n. > [imho] What a mess ...\nAgreed... :-(\n@DrDanRyan, do you have any ideas of how to fix this issue? I'm not sure what's going on with the release, but if you'd like to look into it, please feel free: https://travis-ci.org/formly-js/angular-formly/builds/111880609\n. Good thing you can continue using version 7 and it works just as well as it always has :-)\n. Ah! Neat! Want to add it to the examples site? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-example\n. Hmmm... I'm not seeing it here...\n. Thank you for the help @BarryThePenguin!\n. Could you check it again. It's working fine for me.\n. Hi @MCKRUZ, please move discussion over to #643 \n. Hi @JessyRiordan, yes, this is being tracked in #643, thank you for your patience (and help!)\n. I would recommend you write your own directive that has default options you can use and passes those to formly-form. It's much better to compose things together than to have global options. Anyone want to provide an example of this?\n. Duplicate of #643\n. A wrapper without defined name or type will be set as the default template. This could probably be made more clear in the docs\n\nYou can have a default (used by all templates), named template wrappers, and typed template wrappers (used by fields with the specified type)\n\nIf you give the first wrapper a name, or types, you'll see this behavior is corrected: https://jsbin.com/tafiwa/edit?html,js,output\nIn the future, please ask questions in the chat: http://chat.angular-formly.com thanks!\n. Just realized that perhaps you didn't ask this in the chat because you legitimately thought it was a bug. Thanks for the reproducible example! That made it much easier to help you :sparkles: \n. LGTM, could I have someone else review and merge this? Ping @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators\n. Thanks @kwypchlo!\n\n. Have you tried https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update\n. Any idea why the build is busted? Looks like a shell issue? Maybe related to the quotes you removed? Maybe we should do escaped double quotes?\n. Thanks @BarryThePenguin!\n. Hi @dariusjb and @maxime-beguin,\nThanks for reporting this. It needs more investigation and possibly a fix.\n\nCould anyone provide a fix, please?\n\nThis is a community project, you could makeapullrequest.com or add a bounty on this issue to motivate someone else to do so.\n. Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is by following the instructions at help.angular-formly.com. The GitHub issues on this project are reserved for feature requests and bug reports, so I'm going to close this issue. See you on chat and Stack Overflow!\n. Could you check back in an hour or so? I think RawGit is having trouble...\n. fixed\n. This looks good to me. Thanks @tuxtina! Once the build passes, if someone else wants to review and hit the merge button that'd be great.\n. I would prefer to explicitly check for undefined as well :+1:\n. LGTM! Would like to get another reviewer on this though.\n. This should probably be updated if we want it merged. Things have changed quite a bit since March 19th, 2016....\n. This looks just fine :+1:\n. I'd still like someone else who actually uses the library still to review and merge this though.\n. I am, but would love to give some other people access.\n. I think this looks good. Could you update the commit message so the subject isn't so long?\nI'll let someone else merge this once you've done that. Thanks!\n. LGTM! Thanks!\n. You should hide your form behind  ng-if=\"vm.fields.length\" which will prevent Angular from compiling the form until your fields have loaded.\n. Yeah, adding fields dynamically isn't well supported. Best to have them all at compile time and hide the ones that shouldn't be showing.\n. If this is really part of the specification, it's odd and unexpected. In formly we often do things that abstract away the unexpected parts of the specification. So I think a PR to abstract this away would be acceptable. My thinking is to add a hidden field if there's only one field in fields. Could easily accomplish this in the formly-form template right above this line:\nhtml\n<input type=\"hidden\" ng-if=\"fields.length === 1\" />\nI'm thinking that should do it. Any pull request should accompany tests. makeapullrequest.com :-)\n. Hmmm... I suppose that this might be expected behavior on the part of users. Maybe it's better for the developer to be explicit about how they solve this problem rather than just doing it ourselves.\n. Actually, I'm pretty confident that the API for formly is already too big. You could easily accomplish this with a field transform: https://jsbin.com/yinuda/edit?js,output\n``` javascript\napp.run(function(formlyConfig) {\n  formlyConfig.extras.fieldTransform.push(fieldTransform)\nfunction fieldTransform(fields) {\n    return fields.concat({\n      type: 'input',\n      templateOptions: {\n        type: 'hidden'\n      },\n      hideExpression: 'fields.length !== 2' // where 2 === this one plus one another.\n    })\n  }\n})\n``\n. If you'd like, you can create a plugin for this and I'll add it to [the plugins list](http://docs.angular-formly.com/page/plugins)\n. Hi @seibs! Thanks for the PR! This looks great to me, could I have someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read review this as well?\n. @immortalcy, actually, if you look at the implementation of the example above, it allows you to specify thengOptionsat the field level, and actually you can specify thengOptionsattribute for a specific field usingngModelAttrs` as well. I think that's the generic solution you're looking for...\n. Hi @xphong, I'm not seeing the same thing you are. You can see it working here: https://jsbin.com/bivoxoz/edit?html,js,output\nCould you please reproduce your issue using issue.angular-formly.com? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. I would not recommend this change be made.\n. This is great. Thanks for working on it. Any other reviewers wanna pitch in here? Should probably get at least one other.\n. :clap:\n. LGTM! I'll let someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read give the thumbs up and someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators merge the PR.\n. Agreed. We could make that a breaking change in a future release.\n. Could someone from @angular-formly-collaborators review and merge this?. Sorry, bad @ mention. Someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators please review and merge this. Thanks.. I don't maintain this library anymore, but I should say that you'll definitely want to look at the production tips here: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/tips\nIt will definitely be slow if you don't do those things.. Good luck.. I have developed a work around for my own project that does this. The basic idea is that you make directives out of all of your templates. Then you have another template that simply uses those directives and has something like this for it's options:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'grouped-field',\n  data: {\n    fields: [\n      {\n        type: 'text',\n        label: 'First Name'\n      },\n      {\n        type: 'text',\n        label: 'Last Name'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\nThen, in the template for grouped-field you simply use the directives for the type you pass in and pass the options specified in data.fields Does that make sense?\n. I use a directive for double input:\naz-double-input.js\n``` javascript\n(function() {\n  'use strict';\nangular.module('atac.common').directive('azDoubleInput', azDoubleInput);\nfunction azDoubleInput(COMMON_DIRECTIVES) {\n    return {\n      restrict: 'E',\n      templateUrl: COMMON_DIRECTIVES + 'component/az-double-input.html',\n      scope: {\n        options: '=',\n        formId: '=',\n        index: '=',\n        result: '=',\n        form: '='\n      }\n    };\n  }\n})();\n```\naz-double-input.html\nhtml\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <az-formly-label></az-formly-label>\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\" style=\"padding:0 7px 0 0\">\n    <az-formly-input options=\"options.data.leftField\" result=\"result\" index=\"index\" form-id=\"formId\" form=\"form\"></az-formly-input>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\" style=\"padding:0 0 0 7px\">\n    <az-formly-input options=\"options.data.rightField\" result=\"result\" index=\"index\" form-id=\"formId\" form=\"form\"></az-formly-input>\n  </div>\n</div>\nWhere az-formly-input is the label-less directive version of my formly input template\nThe config uses template instead of type so I can use the directive (could easily turn this into a formly template via setTemplate(...))\njavascript\n{\n  template: [\n    '<az-double-input options=\"options\" form-id=\"formId\" index=\"index\" result=\"result\" form=\"form\">',\n    '</az-double-input>'\n  ].join('')\n  data: {\n    leftField: {\n      key: 'firstName',\n      placeholder: 'First Name',\n      required: true\n    },\n    rightField: {\n      key: 'firstName',\n      placeholder: 'First Name',\n      required: true\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote, some of the stuff you see in there (like form) are part of an abstraction I've added on top of formly that make my life easier. I'm hoping to take the work I've done in my own project and integrate it with formly before too long.\n. @vptcnt and @astrism, I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. If you think it's unresolved, please feel free to open it again and we can talk about what we're lacking.\n. In 0.1.0, we've removed the submit button from the form template entirely. This will not be supported.\n. How difficult would it be to add a template field as well? So it doesn't have to be in a whole other file?\n. I'm looking into it and I'm not sure of the best approach to take.\n~~I'm thinking that it would be best to add an ng-hide=\"field.hide\" to the <formly-field ng-repeat... in the formly-form template. Then, in the formly-form controller, when initializing the scope, iterate through the fields and add a hide property and add a watcher to the scope for each of the hide expressions. When that watch listener fires, set the field.hide property to the value of the expression.~~\n~~The trouble I'm having now is: How do we get the scope to evaluate the expression on (watch the expression). I've thought about adding it as another property to the formField but passing scopes around just feels wrong.~~\nJust came up with a much better simpler implementation. Prepare for a pull request...\n. Will get to this after the weekend. Thanks!\n- Kent C. Dodds\n  Sent from my mobile device, please forgive any errors or brevity.

Alright my changes are in, complete with updated README, bower version, CHANGELOG, and demo. Thanks!\n\nPerhaps eventually we could make it as simple as what I wanted to do (as illustrated by #16)...\n. I just found a better solution. Let me make another pull request and we can talk about it. It actually enables both options so I'll probably just include it in this PR. Give me just a second...\n. @astrism, let me know if you have any questions. But this seems to work quite nicely\n. Just throwing this out there... Would it be more performant if we put an ng-change on the formly-field directive? This way the watch listener is only executed when a change occurred and the watch expression is not evaluated.\nEither way, I don't see a way of getting around a dynamic form definition without doing things this way. And I imagine if this goes the direction you're wanting it to, you're going to have to loop through each field every time the result changes anyway. I think the solution you have above would work well... Let me know if you want me to change my pull request to reflect this.\n. @astrism, I would really love it if we could figure out what needs to happen for this to get merged today. I have another PR I'm creating in a little bit that I would like in, but I don't want to update the changelog for it because we'd have a merge conflict with this PR. Let me know what I need to do to get this in.\n. Nevermind on the grunt build merge conflict. I just remembered I didn't run grunt build because I didn't want to have merge conflicts :-) asap on these though please :-) Thanks!\n. Whoops. Accidentally closed this.\nI rebased master. Not sure if that's how I should have done this, may have been better to merge it. Anyway, if I need to recreate this whole pull request that's fine, let me know what I need to do to get this into the main repo and get the 0.0.10 tag on after this is merged in. Thanks!\n. Thanks @astrism :-)\nWould love some feedback from you. I've done a few PRs in the past, but I'd love to know if there's anything I can do to make this process easier for repo owners. Any feedback for me?\n. :+1: \n. :+1:\n. There are a few ways that you could implement it. You wouldn't be able to use any of the built in types. But you could add your own type with the formlyTemplateProvider's setTemplateUrl function.\nHow I have implemented this kind of thing though is using the template property. You create your own directive with the template of that directive being what you want the field to be. It has access to the options and value properties used in the other templates. And then in the directive's link function you can add functionality (like auto-complete). For example:\n``` javascript\nvar formFields = {\n  key: 'something',\n  template: ''\n};\napp.directive('someAwesomeDirective', function() {\n  return {\n    template: ' formly templatey stuff ',\n    link: function(scope, el, attrs) {\n      scope.functionality = function() {\n        // do something awesome\n      }\n    }\n  };\n});\n``\n. I agree that gettingngMessagesin would be cool. But I would be wary about including it because it's only supported in angular 1.3-beta right now (if I'm not mistaken). If support is added, it would probably be good to make it optional...\n. Thanks for the work on it. However I think that you're doing a lot of work unnecessarily. You have access to the$errorproperty of the form fields viaoptions.formField.$error` in the template. Also, we want to make sure this is an opt-in thing because many people wont have the luxury of being on angular 1.3, so we need to make sure that it can work without the messages on the page.\nAnd one other thing, please make sure that your whitespace is following our project standard. Please use tabs (I know, I hate tabs too, but we need consistency). Thanks again for taking a stab at this!\n. Looks like you're doing that bit alright, but @astrism also asks that we tab and then space forward on continuation lines. It's @astrism's styleguide, I can't remember when I saw him specify that, but the rest of our project looks like it. If you want a sample, see this line.\n. Try this:\njavascript\nangular.element(document.getElementById('formlytext0')).scope().options.formField\nIt works for me on the demo.\n. Really? Huh... Interested to see your PR! Thanks!\n. @abodacs, we haven't done any work to integrate the ngMessages module into formly core. But with where we are now, I don't believe it would make sense for it to go into the core project. It would make more sense for it to go into the template modules.\nI think that we're hoping to create a css framework agnostic module that would be for common template utilities and components. Integration with ngMessages would likely fit in well with something like that.\n. This is definitely a template-specific item. If you want support for ngMessages you'll need to implement templates that make use of them (using the options.formControl that formly adds to your template's scope) or submit a PR to the template library that you're using.\n. I'm interested in this as well...\n. +1, I don't have a use case because all of my stuff is custom templates, but I can definitely see people wanting this if they're using Bootstrap.\n. Where do you think this would be best implemented? Should there be another provider called formlyConfigProvider and have two providers to configure formly (formlyTemplateProvider as well)? Or should we combine these config options into a single formlyConfigProvider?\nI'm sad that the decision was made to create the formlyTemplateProvider instead of having it be more generically formlyProvider. Because now if we want to combine them, it's a breaking change... I'm probably the only one using the formlyTemplateProvider at this point though so that's probably fine... I'd like to hear your thoughts. I plan on implementing this today...\n. I'm implementing this now with a formlyOptionsProvider. It doesn't seem too bad...\n. @astrism, this is now closed, but you need to run the build to get the dist folder up to date...\n. Note: I didn't grunt build, so you'll have to do that yourself before you tag (if you tag at this commit)\n. As I was using this in my project, I noticed that if I didn't provide options, angular got angry at me, but now that I can configure all formly forms to have the options I want I no longer need the options attribute.\n. @astrism any word on this? I have another PR I'm getting ready to do and I want to be able to use master on my fork to do it...\n. Now that I think about it, it doesn't have anything to do with this one, I may submit it before. Thanks.\n. Fixed @astrism. Thanks!\n. +1 to this. Perhaps I'll create a PR (If you don't first @delaman ;D)\n. @astrism, I would recommend closing this issue. It's solved with the template property. Though we could enhance the formlyTemplateProvider to have a setTemplate as well as a setTemplateUrl...\n. I've never used browserify, but I'm a node user and I'm curious how to make the library any more \"node friendly\" when everything is just inside an angular call (other than getting it registered in npm). Can't you simply: require('angular-formly') and the code would run? We don't have to have a module.exports if we're not exporting anything right?\n. Awesome. Well, I think this is one thing that we'll have to leave to the nimbly folks... It's their repo after all... @astrism? :+1: \n. @astrism, I think this is something you'll want to do yourself. You'll want to create the package.json the way you want (authors/desc/etc.) and then you'll want to be the one to publish it so you can be the one to republish it...\n. I think you'd want to just make your own templates for that. I don't think\nit is part of the mission of this library to cover every edge case. Just to\nmake those cases possible...\n- Kent C.

With the current implementation this could be difficult. I think the simplest way to do this would be to change the formly-form template from an html file to a string returned by the template function in the formly-form directive. This would allow conditionally setting the attribute ng-hide or ng-if. I think this would be reasonable.\n. @astrism, I like all of the things you said. I'm not certain whether removing ng-hide would cause adverse impacts on people or not... But it seems to work fine in the demo.\n\nI also think we should keep it in an html file. But I don't know how to configure a specific form to have one directive (ng-if) and another to have another (ng-hide) without having two templates that are almost exact duplicates... I'd definitely get behind this effort.\n. What will have to happen for this is we'll have to store the configured default options in local storage like we do the custom templates thing if we want it to be customizable....\n. This would be a breaking change because anyone who uses a custom template would have to update their template's ng-model (for example).\n. Hmmm... Looking at it now I'm not certain of the best way to go about it. I'm thinking that it would be a diversion from how things currently work a little bit. Right now we just have a result object with all the values hanging off of it. If we were to do a valueHolder then we'd have to keep the result.value and the valueHolder.value in sync.\nOne thing that we could do that may not be a bad way to go about it would be to pass the result itself into the field directive. That may actually be extremely valuable and would be extremely simply to do... I may look into doing that. I'll submit a PR @astrism...\n. Not result.value but result[options.key] would work.\n. Moved this comment to #68 \n. I don't understand your question....\n. You could always $watch properties on the result object.\nHowever, I would recommend making your own template called password-match or something that would have two fields in it and set value to the password's value when they match. This way you can have more control over validation etc. Feel free to check out how I do field matching validation: http://kent.doddsfamily.us/kcd-angular/#/kcd-input-match (copied below)\nkcd-input-match directive\nDocs\nUseful for password and password confirmation input fields. Use like so:\nhtml\n<input ng-model=\"password\" type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Your password\">\n<input pk-input-match=\"{{password}}\" ng-model=\"password2\" type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Your password again (just in case)\">\nThis will set the field's $error.match property to whether it matches the given value or not.\nCode\njavascript\nangular.module('kcd.directives').directive('kcdInputMatch', function() {\n  'use strict';\n  return {\n    require: 'ngModel',\n    restrict: 'A',\n    link: function(scope, elem, attrs, ctrl) {\n      scope.$watch(function() {\n        return attrs.kcdInputMatch === ctrl.$modelValue;\n      }, function(currentValue) {\n        ctrl.$setValidity('match', currentValue);\n      });\n    }\n  };\n});\n. I can't think of a way to make the built in templates generic enough to account for all the different ways to do i18n. I think if you rely on the template to do your i18n for you (through a filter for example) then you'll have to make your own templates. You can easily override the built in templates using the formlyTemplateProvider. See the readme.\nNote, another (more performant) option is to use the $filter service to generate your i18n strings and pass the label and placeholder through that when initializing the formly form. You wouldn't need to change the built in templates with this option.\n. It's available on the 0.0.12 branch. It's not yet released and the documentation for it should probably be in the 0.0.12 branch... You can point to the most recent commit.\n. @ilyagelman, is this working for you now?\n. :+1: that would be convenient. Would be a pretty simple PR if you want to try to take a whack at it. Just edit this file: src/directives/formly-field-select.html and make sure to follow the development instructions.\n. @inalgnu, where did you get on this?\n. Closing as it doesn't have anything to do with formly core anymore and I personally would just use validators for this anyway :-)\n. I can think of a way to get around this limitation, but I think a more appropriate solution would require a PR.\nWhat I'm thinking is in the formly-field.js we add a scope variable called formResult and in formly-form.html we pass the result object in as an argument. This way, all templates would have access to the whole form via the formResult variable on the scope. This would give field templates a lot more power.\nWhat do you think @astrism?\n. @gizmoboy this will be possible with #62. I was waiting on @astrism to review it, but I guess that's why he gave me commit privileges. I'll merge it now... merged... but it's still @astrism's responsibility to rebuild the project and publish it to npm and bower. However, you ought to be able to test it out by pointing to this commit and using the non-built version of the js files. I'll leave this open until @astrism has a chance to rebuild and publish.\n. For some reason I am unable to claim the bounty on the website. Do you need to do something on your end?\n. I have merged this and run the build. Once it's published you can use a version, but until then you can point to this commit and it should work just fine for you.\n. If I understand your use case correctly, then this is possible if you use the result object in your template. I'll have to play around with it, but we may need to update all templates to bind to the result rather than simply the value. That would be another issue altogether. I'll look into it and let you know...\n. Looking at your question again, I think I misunderstood the use case. Could you give me an example of what you're actually trying to accomplish?\nI updated the demo to use the results of one field in the template of another. You can see how this looks on the demo. Enter anything into the \"first name\" field and see how that is bound to the custom template field below. But, again, I don't think this is what you were going for...\n. So this is something that I did on a personal project. I used the same form for creating a post (for example) as I did for editing one. It's quite simple. Instead of using default you simply set the result object that you pass into fromly to have the values of your model. The default only takes effect when the result has no value. So, you probably have something like this:\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"formData\" fields=\"formFields\" options=\"formOptions\" ng-submit=\"onSubmit()\"></formly-form>\njavascript\n$scope.formData = {};\n$scope.formFields = [\n  {\n    key: 'firstName',\n    default: 'Kent C.',\n    type: 'text'\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'lastName',\n    default: 'Dodds',\n    type: 'text'\n  }\n];\nInstead, what you want to do is:\njavascript\n$scope.formData = {\n  firstName: 'Kent C.',\n  lastName: 'Dodds'\n};\n$scope.formFields = [\n  {\n    key: 'firstName',\n    type: 'text'\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'lastName',\n    type: 'text'\n  }\n];\nSo, instead of using the default, set the value of the result you pass in. Does that help?\n. Hmmm... On the top of my head I thought that would do it... Do they not? We may need to have a directive for selects to manage initial values like this then... I've been considering making a place for directive templates like this for use cases like this as well as the button group.\n. Why don't you create a new issue as this is different and this issue is closed. This will take a little work, but I'm pretty sure I know how I would implement it.\n. Why don't you create the issue, put $50 on it, then I'll look into it and suggest more if I feel like it'll take more time...\n. Duplicated here #121 \n. The repo exists. Just need to create the templates, build, and release. Moving discussion to the repo\n. Seems reasonable. I'd say we'd want to have another output file that ended in no-tpls, what do you think?\nEventually, there could be a use case to support templates for more than just bootstrap. We could do style-it-yourself templates where we add some classes to allow customizability, and we could have pure.css templates, and I'm sure there are more. But if we separated these out into their own folders, it would encourage the community to contribute templates for their favorite css libraries. Each of these libraries could have its own build. To do that right, I think that we'd have a breaking change to default to the no templates output and then a {library}-tpls file for each template type. What do you think?\n. Oh, that's interesting. Must have missed seeing that release. Cool. I like that even better actually. have formly.js include the templates, then have a formly.none.js, a formly.bootstrap.js, formly.pure.js, etc. etc.\n. Fixed with b962dd26a68c70c8e9d51f1f9a995d84b405e02e\n. Wow, this is awesome a11y for the win! I noticed that the formatting of some of the files is a little off. Could you fix that before it's merged in? Thanks for doing this!\n. Looks perfect. Thanks again for doing this @jonespen.

I think I have a solution, but I can't seem to reproduce the problem. But judging from the error message you're getting, I'd say that the issue is somehow a field has a watch object with no listener object. We should check that both an expression and listener are present on the watch object before creating the watch. I should have a fix soon, but I'm not certain how this issue is even happening...\n. Sorry, been off the planet for a day. @Rechtsproducten, what you did is how formly is designed to work actually. If you need functionality for your template beyond basic angular template stuff, then you simply create a directive. I actually generally will just us the template property for the formly config, but creating its own type works perfectly well also. Glad you got it working. If you like, I would love it if you could add a wiki article with how you solved the problem. That could help people in the future. Thanks a ton!\n. Interesting... If I go to the demo, it looks like radios are actually working as you expect it should, but the select is not...\n\n\n. Looks good to me. Thanks for doing this! @astrism will be in charge of updating the bower/npm packages.\n. Of course. I was worried about this when we broke out the templates, but I don't think there's really anything we can do about that... Thanks!\n. @gizmoboy, I've actually implemented a few of these custom templates for my own projects so I might be able to help with some of this. Some of these would definitely make sense in the library itself. Here's what I would recommend:\nCreate an issue for every feature you want in the library (non-proprietary stuff). Then use https://www.bountysource.com/ to place a bounty on the issue. Then anyone in the community can take it up if they want to piecemeal and I imagine you'll get most of the things you want pretty quickly.\nWhat do you think?\n. How important is the actual implementation you've described. Because what you've described may not necessarily be the exact best solution for what you're trying to accomplish based on what the library can do currently. Here's what I expect you need (implementation details aside):\n- A way to have a button bar with an option of single and multi-select\n- The value to indicate selection\nIs there more than this that you actually need?\nHere's my expected implementation:\nI'll definitely need to create a directive to handle this. Unfortunately a simple template wont be able to handle this well. Here's the interface for a buttonbar.\njavascript\n{\n    \"key\": \"triedEmber\",\n    \"type\": \"buttonbar\",\n    \"selectStyle\": \"SEE_BELOW\",\n    \"label\": \"Have you tried EmberJs yet?\",\n    \"default\": \"SEE_BELOW\",\n    \"options\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Yes, and I love it!\",\n            \"value\": \"yesyes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Yes, but I'm not a fan...\",\n            \"value\": \"yesno\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Nope\",\n            \"value\": \"no\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nThe selectStyle could be either 'single' or 'multiple'. This would determine what would be set as the value: a boolean for multiple with one options, an object for multiple with more than one option (where the keys are the property names and the value is true/false), and a single value for a single (which would be the value property of the option selected).\nThe default would simply be the initial value and the directive would handle converting that into what the view needs. If the result object provided already has a value, this default will be ignored.\nI think what I've described (including the implementation) is actually pretty well what you described, though we're not going to bring in a dependency on AngularStrap (partially because I'm not a fan of that particular library, and partially because I want to keep our dependencies down). Let me know if this isn't what you're looking for asap because I think I'm going to start working on this now...\n. Actually, I'm going to denote the type as 'buttongroup' as this is what bootstrap calls it.\n. @gizmoboy, as this is going to take a little more time than expected and I don't have a use case for it myself, I've upped the bounty to where I think I would personally be sufficiently motivated to add this feature. Let me know if that works for you and I'll get into implementing it.\n. This has been added. You can see it in the demo in the form of a checkbox above the email field: http://nimbly.github.io/angular-formly\n. Would really like to seek out @astrism's guidance on this one. This is not possible without using some javascript whether it be bootstrap, Angular-UI Bootstrap, or AngularStrap.\nPersonally, I'd say we'd want to do a pure bootstrap implementation so we don't tie people down to angular-ui bootstrap or AngularStrap. However, in all of my personal projects, I don't even include bootstrap's javascript, I just use Angular-UI Bootstrap...\nAnother solution would be to implement it with both Angular-UI Bootstrap and AngularStrap and allow it to be configurable. Unfortunately, the directives for each library are slightly different so we'd have to have an additional template for each small variation... Though we could always try for either an ng-include or a directive for each template where the template property is a function that returns a configured template (between the two I like the later option)...\nLet me know what you think @astrism, but either way, without a use case of my own for this, and with the effort it would take to implement (however that's done) I don't think I'd have the time to do it at the current bounty...\n. I'm not certain that it's necessary to remove value entirely. I would recommend that people use the 'result[options.key]' for custom templates just to avoid isolateScope issues, but the templates we have currently work just fine using the value property. Is there a problem I'm unaware of? No reason to change it if it's working fine and logically...\n. :+1: \n. Everything that I've committed is good to go. I haven't noticed anything wrong with the demo. I think we're good to go. One thing I would say we should add to this project is a full test suite... That would be a bit of an effort. But it should be done.\n. I'd be happy to scaffold our test suite. I don't think that I have the time or use case to justify working on this effort a lot, but I could get us off the ground.\n. Hey @astrism, I'm planning on moving things around a little bit. I think it'll be really good. But I don't want to have merge conflicts. Are you planning on making any changes? I'd rather wait until after 0.0.15 and work off of that release to move all this stuff. When is that going to happen?\n. I'm going to create a test directory with a symbiotic link to src. I'm going move all the demo related stuff to a demo folder with a symbiotic to src. Annnnd... Yeah, that's it.\n. I've got a few minutes to look at it now. I'll look into it.\n. Someone recently made a change to that expression... Let me find their PR. I merged it. I guess I didn't test it well enough. Another case for tests ;-)\n. Yeah, it was #61. Is that what broke us?\n. I would say +1 on not using \"default\". May consider removing that @astrism... People should just load the formlyData with the default values in my opinion.\n. I was looking into it and found that it was a little simpler than I had originally supposed, so I fixed the demo example and removed the default option. You should be able to setup the form data for a select. Let me know if you have trouble.\n. I'm not sure how that could be happening. If you could make a jsbin to\nreproduce the issue, then I could help more.\n- Kent C. Dodds\n  Sent from my mobile device, please forgive any errors or brevity.

Whoops, because the symlink was called bower_components it was ignored via the .gitignore. I think I'm going to remove that from the git ignore. Another option would be to name the symlink different, but then it's a little confusing. Want to use the symlink so we can symlink the bower_components in the test directory as well...\n\nAnyway, what do you think about removing bower_components from the .gitignore?\n. Actually, I want to keep the bower_components out of the src directory because they're more like vendor files than part of our source. Let me know if you disagree. But I think what I'll do is I'll change the place bower installs components to ignored_bower_components and we'll ignore that directory, then we'll create a symlink in the demo folder called bower_components that points to ignored_bower_components. How does that sound?\n. Sorry, having them in src was a mistake (part of why you were unable to run the demo). I'm about to commit my proposed change, let me know what you think of it...\n. @astrism, I just updated the dependencies. Feel free to check it out and merge it. I'm going to go home and may look at it later tonight. Let me know if you have any problems with what I've done. You may want to look at the build...\n. @astrism looks like you have to setup travis-ci on this because I don't have admin access: https://travis-ci.org/profile/nimbly\n. We should add a build badge to the README\n. Awesome. Now we need to kick off a build. I'm not seeing any options to do that... Do you have that? It should have automatically built when you pushed the README file change....\n. Looks like it errored out on bower install...\n. That makes sense. Do you want to work on fixing that?\n. :+1: \n. Awesome! Now all we need are tests that make that build passing actually mean something valuable :-)\n. Thanks for the recommendation @mwawrusch. I've looked into it for other projects but never gotten it setup. I'll create another issue for it.\n. Closing this because we have ok test coverage and we're adding tests all the time. Travis is purring along as well :-)\n. Closed with 4a9df974ed847620b69b6f599c908ae9922c4cad.\n. Perhaps it could fit into the library... What kind of api do you think would make it generic and useful to others?\n. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think @mwawrusch was talking about the length of text in an input but rather having multiples of the same input. Like a contact having multiple phone numbers. I'm thinking this would be difficult to generalize enough to support more than a single use case...\n. Yeah, I definitely believe it belongs in a standalone directive. Whether or not it's included in the library or not is another matter. I'm still on the fence on that one. @astrism?\n. Personally I'd like to see this implemented outside of the library before we think about bringing it in...\n. I like that. So @astrism, do you think that there should be a separate repo for angular-strap and ui-bootstrap templates altogether? I like the idea of having plugins. Thinking a separate repo for these seems appealing... Then you could install formly and the plugin you care about separately...\n. @mwawrusch, any progress on this? Is there any reason to keep this issue open?\n. I implemented something like this at work... Pretty simple. There are several ways to accomplish it based on your use case. I'll see if I can show an example sometime this week.\n. Ok, so I have some wicked abstractions on top of formly that make my life easier (hoping to bring them into some sort of generic formly template library eventually), but here's the meat of my multi-input template:\nhtml\n<div class=\"az-formly-multi-input\">\n  <div ng-class=\"{row: !$last}\" ng-repeat=\"item in result[options.key || index] track by $index\">\n    <az-formly-input class=\"no-padding\"\n                     ng-class=\"{'col-md-7': result[options.key || index].length > 1}\"\n                     options=\"options.data.inputOptions\"\n                     result=\"result[options.key || index]\"\n                     form=\"form\"\n                     index=\"$index\">\n    </az-formly-input>\n    <div class=\"col-md-5 plain-text\" ng-if=\"!$first\">\n      <az-action-link action=\"result[options.key || index].splice($index, 1)\">\n        <i class=\"fa fa-times\"></i> Remove Number\n      </az-action-link>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\nWhere the az-formly-input directive is simply the directive version of my formly input field. Then, I have a control elsewhere to add a new item (which amounts to just pushing an item to the result[options.key || index] array), but it would be pretty simple to place that wherever depending on your use case. I use this template with formly via this config:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'multi-input',\n  key: 'numbers',\n  data: {\n    inputOptions: {\n      required: true\n      // this is all the normal options you use for a formly field of type 'input'\n    }\n  }\n}\nAs far as having sub-forms, this would actually be relatively simple as well. You'd simply have a formly template that uses a formly-form directive and then you'd pass in all the data the formly-form needs.\nAlternatively, you would just manage this yourself (which I think would be preferable). It just really depends on your use case. If you think there's a good generic implementation with a good api that you think would provide what most people are looking for out of this then let me know, but I'm thinking that it's definitely a case-by-case situation here.\n. That plunker is using a version of formly that doesn't have field.runExpressions, so I'm not sure I understand what you mean.\nEither way, I think this is probably not the best way to accomplish what you're trying to do. Perhaps a better approach would be to have something like this:\nhtml\n<formly-form ng-repeat=\"user in vm.users\" fields=\"::vm.getUserFields()\" result=\"user\">\n  <button ng-click=\"vm.users.splice($index, 1)\">Remove User</button>\n</formly-form>\n<button ng-click=\"vm.users.push({})\">Add User</button>\nAnd then in the controller:\n``` javascript\nvar vm = this;\nvm.users = [];\nvm.getUserFields = getUserFields;\nfunction getUserFields() {\n  return [\n    {\n      key: 'firstName',\n      type: 'text',\n      label: 'First Name'\n    },\n    {\n      key: 'lastName',\n      type: 'text',\n      label: 'Last Name'\n    }\n  ];\n}\n```\nI think this approach makes the most sense. What do you think? If you think there's a way that formly could make this process simpler, I'm all ears. I want this to be as good if not better than the angular-schema-form module, so please let me know if you feel like it's lacking anything! :D\n. I'm still not certain that I understand the issue you're having. But I think that it may be related to the different contexts that expressions are evaluated under. watchers expressions evaluate with the form's scope, while expressionProperties and validators evaluate with the field's scope. See this for more info and reasonings for why.\nCould that be the cause problem you're seeing? I've made the remove and add buttons function properly (here) and everything seems to be functioning as expected. Let me know.\nAs for the infinite digest loop, perhaps you could use ng-init to set options.fields. This would prevent both problems. I understand your desire to keep form fields coupled with the rest of the fields it is supposed to represent. I think the ng-init approach in your sub-form template is a good way to go. Perhaps I'll look into that as well. Seems like a pretty reasonable solution.\nAs far as an improved API, I looked more closely at the angular-schema-form API and I didn't really get much inspiration from it. Their api fairly complex and I see some serious weaknesses with it (there are some obvious strengths as well). Either way, it's wildly different from formly.\n. A hah, it wasn't working as I thought it was. Here is a functioning plunk I think: http://plnkr.co/edit/Tb3zEBkD0keF4YvH203z?p=preview\nIt's using ng-init and seems to work well. Let me know what you think.\n. I think I finally understand the issue now. I think I have a little more time to spend on this problem tonight. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\n. Thanks for using formly! I am committed to formly as a vast majority of my projects require forms and formly simplifies my life immensely. I really want to make things even easier for everyone and I believe this sub-form concept is definitely a valuable use case to cover. When we're finished, hopefully we can get this into the template modules as well.\n. @kaylarose, Fixed! :facepunch: I switched over to jsbin because debugging angular in plunker is a bit of a pain. The issue was we actually were overwriting options.fields every time because options was referencing the upper field's options, not each form's options. Anyway, here's the solution. It's not too bad I think and it doesn't require a getFields function:\nhttp://jsbin.com/jaloz/2/edit?html,js\n. The :: is for one time binding introduced in angular 1.3. If you could post\nyour findings in the wiki, that would be awesome. Thanks!\n- Kent C.

Closing this as we seem to have a working solution now. If anyone has objections, let me know.\n. This is an interesting idea... What do you think this would do to our development lifecycle? Would it complicate things to have to pull down multiple repos to make sure you didn't break something? Or should we just make sure we have a solid test suite?\n\nOne thing I like about this is that most of the issues reported on this repo are template related. It would be nice to make that clear separation... I'm leaning toward this idea...\n. I think that nimbly should create the bootstrap and vanilla repos. Then other people could create their own template \"plugin\" repos as needed. But we already have the templates for those so we should just keep those with nimbly. I don't think a new org is necessary.\nI think we should take the opportunity with 0.1.0 to break as much as we need to get things where we want them to be right now. I'm hoping that the core will change very little after this, which is why I like splitting out the templates. Those repos will likely change a lot more than this one.\n. I'm fine with that. nbd\n. Perhaps we could put that logic in formly-core? In the config provider just have a method called setupNormalTemplates or something and the template repos would have a config to do this? Just a thought.\n. Sweet glory! Thanks @astrism!\n. Done and done :+1: Thanks! This will inspire me to increase the coverage of the codebase. I'm sure it's pretty low right now considering I just started writing tests for it a few months ago :-/\n. Yeah, I use coveralls for api-check (which fails if it has anything less than 100% code coverage :-D). Thanks for doing this. I think that I'm going to put some time into writing more tests to bring the coverage up before I add the badge to the readme though. It's a little embarrassing... I'll try to get that done asap. Thanks!\n. Closing this in favor of a single issue\n. I think that this library has a good setup for this... https://github.com/alianza-dev/angular-scope-types\n. Finally done!\n. Looks good to me. @astrism was the one who made changes in there recently, so I'll let him review this and verify it was a simple mistake and merge this fix in.\n. @antoinepairet, note, there will be a number of breaking changes in 0.1.0, so just be prepared to upgrade.\n. This wasn't a duplicate. This was the bootstrap version for the fix. Reopening and merging.\n. Looks like your formatting is incorrect there (spaces instead of tabs). I think we need to add jshint to our travis build.\n. :+1: \n. Sorry we sort of missed this one @antoinepairet, but looking at it again this is actually not how templates work. The template property is an actual string that is the template. If you want to specify a templateUrl then that's another property you can specify and we get that from the template cache.\n. Looks like a better direction to go would be to use jscs\n. I would simply add:\njavascript\nvar stopWatching = $scope.$watch('formData.language', function(newValue) {\n  if (!newValue) {\n    return;\n  }\n  stopWatching();\n  // Move on\n});\nRemember that the formFields keys are the values on formData so you can do this just fine.\nAnother option is to use the watch property on fields. It's basically the same concept, except it provides you with the field as the first parameter so you have a little more flexibility if you need it. But I would recommend going the normal watch route first.\nAlso, I'm not crazy about the use of $parent in your template. Instead of that, you could do what we do in the example in custom-template and do:\nhtml\n<li ng-repeat=\"option in options.options\"><a class=\"button expand\" ng-click=\"result[options.key || index] = option.value;\" >{{option.name}}</a></li>\nNotice you don't need to invoke optionsData() either as formly will take care of setup the options object on your scope for you.\nPlease close this issue if this resolves your concern.\n. I would say it's probably better to use custom templates. However, I'll\nlook into how difficult it would be to add input masks as a configuration\noption...\nKent C.

Angular UI-Utils has this functionality, however, I believe that I speak for @astrism when I say we would like to keep formly as dependency free as possible...\n. This is great! Thanks. I'll give it a look over soon and merge it in.\n- Kent C. Dodds\n  Sent from my mobile device, please forgive any errors or brevity.

This code doesn't follow our spacing style (we use tabs, that was not my decision...). Could you please make the necessary updates to use tabs instead of spaces?\n. Other than that this looks great. Thanks for doing this!\n. Thanks a bunch!\n. You probably have a really hard time with vendor libraries huh? :-/\n\nWe're not going to adjust the templates to support your use case. Here are a couple options you have (in order of recommendation):\n1. Don't render templates with Django. There are many reasons why you should just have your server act as purely a services layer and serve your static files (html, css, js) on a CDN.\n2. Just use formly.min.js instead of the templates and make your own templates. That stinks, I know, and I'm sorry that you have to render your stuff server side as well.\nGood luck to you!\n. Give me an example of a library that does support this so I can see how they did it.\n. You're right. Angular-UI Bootstrap is using $interpolate to construct some of their templates. Not all of them though, for example, in this plunker I don't know how the alert is working because it uses {{ }} in the alert.html template...\nI've gotten a hack working in this plunker. If you look at setElementTemplate in the formly-field directive, around line 140, I've added a check for the start and end symbols and I do a replace for those in the templates.\nI think that this is the only reasonable solution. I don't expect this to really cause serious issues. It would not affect those not changing the symbols so I think that I'll put it in. I'll make a PR and I'll let @astrism look at it and merge it.\nThanks for not giving up on me @khasinski. Once again I'm reminded that I don't know everything...\n. It will go into master which is a little different from 0.0.16 (which you're likely using. You'll have to point your bower to the hash of the build commit to get the latest stuff. See CHANGELOG.md to see the breaking changes. They should have fairly minimal impact on you as I expect you have very little integration with formly as it is.\nThe PR is coming in a few minutes, but I want @astrism to have a look at it before it's merged.\n. @khasinski, technically, you should be able to point to this hash and start using the fix right away: 79cdc6d231da0655ba2a29aab3bbcb52d5961431\nNote: I noticed that using [[ ]] broke one of the demo's custom templates. I didn't look too much into it because using a different start and end symbol fixed the issue just fine and because it's a custom template you'll have total control over it. I just thought you'd like to know you may have to work around some things.\nMay the force be with you :-)\n. :+1: @astrism \n. Here are the templates with the appropriate changes:\n- vanilla\n- bootstrap\n. With version 0.0.16, the submit button works just the same as it always has. See here for information on how to configure options for the submit button.\nIn master, things have been changed around a bit where the formly-form doesn't have a submit button. This is leading up to our 0.1.0 update which will hopefully happen as soon as @astrism returns from his travels.\nIf you're running on master, then you'll benefit from looking at how the demo adds a submit button. If you're on 0.0.16 then I'm not certain what your issue is. If your developer made a custom build of formly I would recommend that you don't do that... Just let us know what was lacking from formly and we'll see what we can do to support your use cases...\n. Good plan. If we don't provide the proper apis, please let me know...\n. In 0.0.16, the ability to configure formly to use ng-if instead of ng-hide was implemented and the formly-form.html template was removed. This was an enhancement and not a breaking change.\nThe part of the template that checks hideSubmit is here. In the compile function below, the template is altered based on whether the form is supposed to use ng-if. Let me know if there's a bug in there that needs to be fixed.\nYou may also consider updating to master as this is the direction we're heading soon anyway. See the changelog for the breaking changes your new developer will need to account for.\n. Hmmm... There may be some changes, but I believe the api should remain pretty stable. If you like, I'll make sure to let you know when there are any breaking changes. Honestly, I would recommend simply using the hash in your bower dependency so you don't get auto-upgraded.\nBut I believe the api should be consistent. However, one major change upcoming will be when we break formly away from the templates and break them out into separate repositories. This should be coming pretty soon and the dist folder for this repository will contain only formly.js and formly.min.js. You'll have to add a dependency on the template directory of your choice to get the built-in templates you enjoy now. \nI've created an issue (#94) where I'll post when things like this happen if you'd like to stay up to date.\n. I'm going to close this for now as the root issue was resolved.\n. We're still waiting on @astrism to split out the templates into their own repositories and transition this repository to be owned by the angular-formly org... Once that happens, we can probably get this released soon.\n. Before we push 1.0.0, could we implement this suggestion I make in this comment on #107?\n. Perfect\n- Kent C.

Noticed you got the repo transferred. Awesome. Perhaps you can create an angular-formly shell repo in nimbly for gh-pages. Even though github.com/nimbly/angular-formly will forward to github.com/angular-formly/angular-formly, the demo page http://nimbly.github.io/angular-formly/ does not forward.\n. As another note, I'm in the process of developing react-formly. I'm thinking it may make sense to put it in the same org? Thoughts on this? What if we renamed the org to \"formly\" and the template repos had an angular or react prefix to the repo name??\n. Awesome, so I suggest the org name should be simply \"formly\" then we'd have:\n\nangular\n- angular-formly\n- angular-formly-templates-bootstrap\n- angular-formly-templates-vanilla\nreact\n- react-formly\n- react-formly-templates-bootstrap\n- react-formly-templates-vanilla\nYou can feel free to just worry about the angular repos for now I think. I'll create the react ones when they're ready.\nAre those names too verbose?\n. Hmmm.... Well, what do you think about the idea of creating a single JSON powered form solution to rule them all that just has adapters for other libraries/frameworks/etc.?\n. I know that Jason is doing that with angular-data right now. He's creating a more generic js-data in vanilla javascript and then creating hooks for angular/ember/backbone/react/etc... What if we did that for forms?\nWhat if we did js-forms?\n. Then we could work on abstracting out the pieces that rely on angular... Perhaps the core would be pretty minimal... This may not be necessary. Because we're pretty reliant on the framework currently. I wonder if it makes sense. But I'm tired of re-implementing things every time a new shiney framework comes along. Would be nice to just have a generic solution that could be adapted to the framework...\n. It would be really awesome if you could have the exact same data structure to control the form elements and swap out the view layer and everything would still work. That would be pretty amazing.\n. Valid point @gizmoboy, but unfortunately, there are compelling reasons to move to something like react. It's not just that it's shiney and new.\n. I'll let you decide what you want to do @astrism. Either way is fine with me.\n. Good point. I don't know what you could abstract. As far as a spec, I highly doubt there's a spec in existence. We could probably make our own...\nStarted this, got pulled off...\nhttps://github.com/angular-formly/angular-formly/wiki/JSON-Specification\n. That's fine with me.\n. Huzzah!\nKent C.

Would love to create an alliance between the two libraries. Let's move this discussion to their repo: kelp404/angular-form-builder#50\n. FYI to any interested. Some major updates have been made since 1.0.0 was released. I believe it may be wise to cut a 2.0.0 before too long. @astrism and I plan to meet next month, we will likely be cutting the new version at that time (either that, or we'll release what we have now as 2.0.0 and make additional updates as 3.0.0).\n\nMy current project that relies heavily on formly is pointing to a SHA in it's bower.json for formly. I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend that for anyone else, but if you want to get all the sweet new api changes and improvements I recommend looking at your upgrade path by seeing the changelog.\n. Made some additional major changes that will require (hopefully minor) find/replace changes in templates. The most notable (since I last mentioned it):\n- watch changed to watcher\n- formly-form attribute name changed to form to be more clear about what's going on.\n- Removed options from formly-form. The id of the form is now generated by formly.\n- Renaming formField to formControl - This will likely require the biggest change for your templates.\n- No longer expecting options.key for the name attribute of ng-model elements. Now expecting id. Also, formly will automatically attach the formControl to the form for each field that doesn't have noFormControl: true. A suppressible warning will be logged if the formControl cannot be found. This will also require some rework of your custom templates. The master branches of the bootstrap and vanilla templates have this update.\nI realize that some of these changes are pretty significant and may require a bit of work on people's part to get things working with the upcoming version of formly. But I believe that the api to formly is improved big time. Still a little more to do (especially with template utilities), but I believe we're headed in the right direction! Please keep feature requests coming!\n. Another big change today. Changing from the name result to model. This makes the purpose of the attribute more clear. This will be part of the 2.0.0 release coming soon (hopefully).\n. Anyone mind me closing this issue? Let me know and I'll reopen it.\n. Hmmm... I'm not sure I understand the complications you described. To get the most basic thing setup, see this codepen\n. The \"controller as\" syntax is recommended, but not required. Glad you got it working.\n. I actually saw this bug this morning. I know what it is. It came in when I added validation. You have to give your form a name. I'll fix this bug later, but if you give your form a name that should solve the problem:\nhtml\n<formly-form name=\"formName\" result=\"formData\" fields=\"formFields\" options=\"formOptions\" ng-submit=\"onSubmit()\">\n</formly-form>\n. Just realized that I pushed another build which may make this one have a merge issue. I guess this is why you don't build the project in a PR. I'll try to remove that commit from this PR.\n. We're not going to merge this in. If you want to use a different start and end symbol, you'll have to provide your own templates.\n. That's perfect. Thanks!\n. Good to have you back @astrism :-)\n. Looks awesome. I'll merge, then pull, build, and push, and redeploy. Thanks!\n. Awesome, if anyone needs this right now they can point to e3d165a72d6c4a9c56819c4c8d0c885cee34b490 in their bower and get this feature. Hopefully we'll be able to release a new version soon.

So, you're right, the $error property comes from angular's Form Controller. You could glean more information using angular's NgModelController's $error. If a field template has an input with an ng-model that utilizes the formly-dynamic-name directive, then the field will have a formField which will have the $error populated by the NgModelController. You can get more fine grained information using this formField. All the built-in templates should have this currently.\nWe definitely appreciate the contributions!\n. Closing this issue for now. If you want to take a whack at it, that'd be awesome. Just trying to clean things up a bit.\n. Hmmm... Good point... I think instead we should use $timeout. I'll push a fix soon.\n.

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but you can't put an ng-model on an li element. It simply doesn't work in that context. So this isn't a bug in angular-formly, but maybe I can help you accomplish what you're trying to do... Do you want the value to be an array of the selected checkboxes?\n. Try this Will that do what you want?\n. Then at that point you could simply add a watcher in the controller of your directive to watch for changes that would update the value, and manually update the value yourself (ie, not in the template).\n. Nice catch. That needs to be fixed. Thanks...\nWith regards to the submit button. This has been a breaking change. You now provide your own submit button via transclusion in the formly-form directive.\n. No, the reason for it is on the latest stuff, we created a templateless\nbuild. This became formly.js.

Hi @micouz, trying to clean up old issues, is this resolved?\n. Sorry, meant to wait for you to respond before I closed it. Now I'll wait for you to respond before I reopen it :-)\n. The second argument to a validator.validate function is the scope which has a result. You can use that result to determine whether the input is valid based on other fields. https://github.com/nimbly/angular-formly#validators-objectarray\n. There is an example.\n\nYou are correct. All the validators do currently is add parsers to the ngModelCtrl of a field. They have no concept of error messaging and they shouldn't. It should be the role of the template to display errors to the user.\nPerhaps we could add error messages to the templates as you see here, but that's definitely a template responsibility, not a formly core resopnsibility.\n. Having a function is not valid json. It becomes an object at that point... If you need valid json then you need to use an expression rather than a function. Something like this should do the same thing you were trying to do:\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"validate\": \"'sam'===value\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\nObviously, this isn't as complicated as what you're trying to accomplish, so your expression will be a little complex... Not sure why you need it to be 100% JSON, but it should be possible regardless, albeit a little ugly and long...\n. Here's an example expression referencing another field's value:\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"otherSample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"someOption\": \"awesomesauce\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"validate\": \"results.otherSample === 'sweetness' && options.someOption === 'awesomesauce' && value === 'sam'\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\nDo you have a suggestion of how what you're trying to do could be supported better?\n. I can see how that solution could be done and I don't have a problem using eval with an opt-in type behavior on the validator (instead of validate it would be dangerouslyValidate or something). But just want to make sure that it's going to be useful to someone if we do.\nI'd probably make it so whatever is being \"dangerously validated\" would have the scope in scope of the function so it could be used. Here's an example of using the api that there could be:\njavascript\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"otherSample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"someOption\": \"awesomesauce\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"dangerouslyValidate\": \"(function() { var someCheck = results.otherSample.match(/^sweet.*ness$/g) && options.someOption.length > 3; if (someCheck) { return value.some(function(x) { return x.charCodeAt(0) > 100; }); } else { return value === 'sam'; } })();\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\nNotice that\n1. you can do more complex stuff (like if statements, regexes, and you could do loops) that you can't do with angular's $parse service.\n2. You have access to results, options, and value.\n3. You provide a self-invoking function\nWould this be a reasonable api?\nHere's an example implementation that works:\njavascript\nfunction evaluate(results, options, value, script) {\n  return eval(script);\n}\nvar dangerouslyValidate = \"(function() { var someCheck = results.otherSample.match(/^sweet.*ness$/g) && options.someOption.length > 3; if (someCheck) { return value.some(function(x) { return x.charCodeAt(0) > 100; }); } else { return value === 'sam'; } })();\";\nvar results = { otherSample: 'sweetness' };\nvar options = { someOption: 'lo' };\nvar value = 'sam';\nvar validates = evaluate(results, options, value, dangerouslyValidate);\nconsole.log(validates); // logs true\nWould love @astrism to weigh in here.\n. @gizmoboy, sorry this was never implemented. Do you still need this functionality?\n. Closing this for now unless someone asks for this functionality again.\n. @4ware, you don't need to use a function to do that. You can easily do that using the string version of a Formly Expression\n. Nothing like this was ever added and I don't expect it ever will be. If you need to do regex that's already possible via a pattern. See the Mac Address configuration in this example. Also, you can get pretty far with putting complex logic on the client and referencing that logic in your config using fieldTransforms.\nGood luck.. Wow @acido69, you've uncovered a very serious issue in our build. Thanks a ton! I'll make a comment or two on some lines in the PR. If you could address those then I think we'll pull this in. Thanks again!\n. That's an awesome refactor. Thanks for doing that. We need to think about this in the context of us breaking out the templates into their own repositories now that the organization has been created and the repo has been moved over... I think we may want to hold on this one :-/\n. @astrism, the entire build will need to change since we're splitting the templates out, so I'd say yes.\n. Thanks for the PR. I believe the original issue has been fixed.\n. Please see the note in the first line under the Documentation\n. That's not a valid expression unfortunately. The $parse service (used by $compile rejects it). You'd have to do something like this:\njavascript\ntemplate: '<div>Today\\'s date is {{ options.data.now | date:MM/dd/yyyy }}</div>',\ndata: {\n  now: new Date()\n}\nAlternatively you could do that logic in a directive controller or something...\n.

I can't seem to find anywhere in the code that has the line $scope.options.default...\nIn fact, there's nowhere in the code at all that uses the keyword default. I'm guessing that you're using an older version of formly. I would recommend upgrading to the latest version (1.0.0 as of today).\n. There is no tutorial, but you can have Bootstrap as an example. It's actually quite simple. Actually, I just created a new templates repository angular-formly-templates-foundation that's basically a copy of the angular-foundation-templates-bootstrap repo. If you are willing and able, we'd love it if you could submit a PR to that to change the templates from bootstrap to foundation!\nThere's an initial release milestone on the repo with a few issues in it. You could do everyone a big favor by submitting a PR to close those issues and get that repo out the door if you can!\n. Closing this here to move discussion over to angular-formly-templates-foundation.\n. This is awesome, but it's outside formly's role. You could easily do this yourself just using formly.\n. If I get time @gladson, but I don't think I'll have time to create your app for you...\n. Just as a recommendation of an approach, you'd just have an ng-repeat on the models and pass that in to the result attribute.\n. Good luck! Let us know if you get it working and if there's anything the formly-js core can do to improve the api to make what you're trying to do simpler.\n. @psi-4ward, yes, this is not a problem for the core to solve. I have a project where I do something similar to this and all I do is have a separate form for each subform.\n. Here's an example. Obviously you'd need to style it yourself... http://plnkr.co/edit/fft0F5ZMtY3fOw6Js9hb?p=preview\n. Done :-)\n. Not certain off the top of my head. If you could reproduce the issue then maybe I can figure out why this is happening. Thanks!\n. I added it. It's been in for a little bit. It should actually work on a formly-form so I'm not sure why it's not working for you. The directive itself is pretty simple (though it could be improved by using the compile function instead of a controller...). If you're using angular 1.3 then the name attribute is interpolatable and you wont need the directive anyway.\nThe reason it was added is for field validation. The only way to get validation on an ng-model is by putting a name attribute on the same element and for that element to be a child of a named form. Prior to 1.3, the name attribute couldn't be dynamic. So this directive was a work around to that.\n. I'm not sure what you mean by \"also take local values\" can you explain what you mean?\n. I see. I'm thinking we'll want to rework the formly-dynamic-name directive a little bit to use the compile function instead of a a controller. I'm pretty busy at work right now but hopefully I will have some time soon to address this.\n. Until I get time to fix the root issue, one way you could work around it is by making sure that the forms on your page exist on separate scopes. That way you can give them each a hard coded name and not worry about collisions. In my project I have a directive that wraps formly so I can abstract away the dependency and have some good defaults. You could do the same. If you need a reference to the form, then you can add that as a doubly bound attribute and \"pass it back\" in that way.\nThis is my implementation of this (note, I'm using controller as syntax, if you're not familiar with that then Todd Motto has a good explanation:\n``` javascript\n// az-form.js\nangular.module('atac.common').directive('azForm', function azFormDirective(COMMON_URL, ) {\n  'use strict';\n  return {\n    restrict: 'E',\n    templateUrl: COMMON_URL + 'directives/components/az-form.html',\n    scope: {\n      form: '=?',\n      result: '=',\n      fields: '=',\n      formId: '@',\n      onSubmit: '&'\n    },\n    transclude: true,\n    bindToController: true,\n    controllerAs: 'vm',\n    controller: function() {\n      var vm = this;\n      vm.id = vm.formId || (vm.result || {}).id || Math.random() * 999999;\n      vm.describedFields = .filter(vm.fields, function(item) {\n        return item.hasOwnProperty('description');\n      });\n    },\n    link: function(scope, el, attrs) {\n      if (attrs.hasOwnProperty('form')) {\n        var stopWatching = scope.$watch('azForm', function(form) {\n          if (angular.isDefined(form)) {\n            stopWatching();\n            scope.vm.form = form;\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  };\n});\n```\nhtml\n<!-- az-form.html -->\n<formly-form name=\"azForm\"\n             novalidate\n             result=\"vm.result\"\n             fields=\"vm.fields\"\n             options=\"::{uniqueFormId: vm.id}\"\n             class=\"space-inputs\"\n             ng-submit=\"vm.onSubmit(result)\">\n  <div class=\"col-md-9 col-md-offset-3 text-muted margin-top5 margin-bottom15\" ng-if=\"vm.describedFields.length\">\n    <div ng-repeat=\"field in ::vm.describedFields\">{{field.description}}</div>\n  </div>\n  <ng-transclude></ng-transclude>\n</formly-form>\nThen I have one place where I use it like so:\nhtml\n<az-form result=\"vm.userInfo\"\n         form=\"vm.userFormRef\"\n         fields=\"vm.formFields\"\n         on-submit=\"vm.login(vm.userInfo)\">\n  <div class=\"action-buttons col-md-offset-9 col-md-3\">\n    <button type=\"submit\"\n            ng-disabled=\"vm.userFormRef.$invalid\"\n            class=\"btn btn-primary az-btn\"\n            az-loading-button=\"vm.loggingIn\">\n      Sign In\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</az-form>\nI hope this helps.\n. FYI @kbdaitch, the current version of formly in master has a breaking change that may impact you so I thought I'd let you know. Instead of using the form tag, formly now uses ng-form which doesn't work with ng-submit or submit the form with a button[type=\"submit\"]. This is truly unfortunate and kinda lame, however it allows you to nest forms properly (as HTML doesn't actually allow you to nest form elements).\nIf you really want ng-submit and submit buttons to work for you, I feel you. So much that I made it work anyway. Here's what I did, maybe you can benefit:\n``` javascript\n(function() {\n  'use strict';\nangular.module('atac.common').directive('ngForm', ngForm);\nfunction ngForm() {\n    return {\n      restrict: 'E',\n      link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n        var ngForm = scope.$eval(attrs.name);\n        if (ngForm) {\n          ngForm.azSubmit = function() { // <-- named azSubmit because az is my app's prefix\n            if (ngForm.$invalid) {\n              return;\n            }\n            var context = scope;\n            if (attrs.hasOwnProperty('submitFormOnParent')) {\n              context = scope.$parent;\n            }\n            ngForm.azSubmitting = context.$eval(attrs.ngSubmit);\n            scope.$safeApply(); // <-- you'll need to implement this\n            return ngForm.azSubmitting;\n          };\n          element.on('keyup', function(event) {\n            if (event.which === 13 && attrs.ngSubmit) {\n              ngForm.azSubmit();\n            }\n          });\n          var submitButton = element.find('[type=submit]');\n          if (submitButton.length === 1) {\n            submitButton.on('keyup', function(event) {\n              if (event.which === 32 || event.which === 13) {\n                ngForm.azSubmit();\n              }\n            });\n            submitButton.on('click', function(event) {\n              ngForm.azSubmit();\n            });\n          } else if (!.isEmpty(submitButton)) {\n            throw new Error('Forms should only have one submit button');\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    };\n  }\n})();\n```\nHope that's helpful when you decide to upgrade formly when we cut 2.0.\n. That approach sounds fine to me. @gizmoboy has done some interesting things with dynamic data in formly. Perhaps he has some tips...\n. Coming back through some issues. Reading this again, I think I misunderstood the question. If you want to pre-populate a form with values, you simply need to set values on the model. The form is a reflection of the current state of the model (aka result). So, if I had:\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"user\" fields=\"fields\"></formly-form>\njavascript\n$scope.fields = [\n  { type: 'text', key: 'firstName' }\n];\nthen all I would have to do to pre-populate the form with some default value would be\njavascript\n$scope.user = {\n  firstName: 'Grant'\n};\nDoes this make sense/cover your use case?\n. Closing this issue for now because inactivity.\n. Closed via 4b44e60603ef94947ca44dcc8d82094d1981f719\n. See this plunker. It's quite simple.\nhtml\n<div>\n  {{options.label}}\n  <input ng-model=\"result[options.key]\" type=\"date\" />\n</div>\nThen style it however you wish...\n. The new wrapper functionality makes this a much better experience. I don't know if we can quite get to where I was hoping for this one, but we're in a pretty good place I think!\n. Thank you. This is great news that it'll be fixed (hopefully) in 1.3.4 :-)\n. :clap: \n. Hi @sucheendra, the best way to get help is to follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nFor your first question, you'll simply set the type property in templateOptions to number and that should do it for you.\nFor your second question, please go to that help link and create an example of what you mean.\n. This can be accomplished by specifying a model for the field like so:\njs\n$scope.foobar = {\n  foo: {\n    bar: 'hello'\n  }\n};\n$scope.fields = [{\n  model: $scope.foobar.foo,\n  key: 'bar'\n}];\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"foobar\" fields=\"fields\" />\nThis is supported as of 9f10f57e99ed5100f49f9eec48e5a051cfe60bfe\n. Done\n. FYI @astrism.\n. Hmmm... I just looked at the demo and it seems to work fine for me... @astrism?\n. Oh, understood. I'd rather just pull the template specific information out of the docs (see #133)\n. We moved all this info to the template docs.\n. Good feedback. I have accomplished this with my own set of field types. It's fairly simple. We have thought about making a repo for generic templates like this one. Stay tuned.\n. Another easy way to do this is to simply have two forms.\n. Totally. I don't know what the process is like, but these variations would be awesome:\n- latest: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/dist/formly.js\n- stable: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/1.0.0/dist/formly.js\n@astrism will be releasing 2.0.0 soon, would be good to get that on cdnjs as well. At that time, 2.0.0 would be stable and 1.0.0 would be legacy.\nIs it possible to have CDNJS pull from master to get latest anytime there's a commit to latest? If not, then there's no reason to have latest. Thanks.\n. Understood.\n. Hi @snimavat, could you please provide a link to a jsbin that demonstrates the issue (clone this template). I use controller as in all of my projects and things work just fine for me so if I see what you're doing I'm sure I can identify what the problem is.\n. By putting the name attribute on the formly-form, the form controller is bound to the isolate scope of the formly-form directive. You'll want to place it on the surrounding form element like so:\nhttp://jsbin.com/qubozo/1/edit?html,js,output\n. Please close this issue if it is resolved.\n. You're right. I'll take another q look at this when I get the chance.\n- Kent C.

Yes, angular-fromly adds the name attribute for you and binds a form attribute for you to alleviate confusion.

Yeah, you're going to need custom templates for those. For the multi-small-form stuff, I would recommend what we ended up doing in #76 here. For multi-select, you'll have to come up with something on your own, though I know there are several libraries that claim to do this quite easily. For file upload, you'll need to create your own template to do this. I recommend using a directive similar to the exampleSubform in the multi-small-form example so you can add a controller to do the actual upload. Good luck!\n. @abodacs, have you resolved your issue?\n. Thanks! I'm not sure what you're asking about. Are you talking about json-schema.org? I have no experience with that, but you're not the first to ask about this. #114 is about the same thing I believe. Could you explain what benefits we'd get from this. And how do you envision this being included?\n. Just to confirm, by\nYou (the Formly maintainer(s)) can use other validators (like TV4) to do the validation and not write/maintain validation related code.\n\nyou're talking about use validating the field configuration to verify that it is correct? So we can warn the developer when they provide a config that is incorrect.\n. I apologize. I've never had any experience with JSON Schemas. So please understand if I just don't get it. But if I understand you correctly, you're saying that the FDD could validate the model which to me doesn't make any sense. The FDD describes the fields that represent the model. They do have a validators property, but that's a JavaScript/angular specific thing.\nOne thing that might make sense is to add a schema property to the field config that allows you to use a JSON Schema validator to validate the model. This would be in lieu of validators but would behave just like validators in that it would $setValidity for the NgModelController based on whether the schema validation passed. Would this be a good api to accomplish what you're talking about?\nBy the way, sorry I closed #114... I should have pursued it further or at least asked you before closing it.\n. This is very interesting. I think I'm finally getting it :laughing:\nSo, I'm thinking to enable this, we'd do something like this:\njavascript\nangular.module('yourModule').config(function(formlyConfigProvider) {\n  formlyConfigProvider.schemaValidator(function(data, schema) {\n    var invalidValidators = validateSchema(data, schema);\n    return !invalidValidators.length ? true : invalidValidators;\n  });\n});\nWhere invalidValidators would be something like:\njson\n[\"required\", \"maxLength\"]\nAnd formly would take the invalidValidators and apply it to the NgModelController via $setValidity and you could use it with ngMessages like so:\nhtml\n<div ng-messages=\"options.formControl.$error\">\n  <div ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div>\n  <div ng-message=\"maxLength\">Input too long</div>\n</div>\nDo you think this would be acceptable? Do you think that I'm missing anything?\n. And of course that validateSchema function would likely call into tv4 or something similar, but I don't want to include that library in formly. I'd like people to bring in whatever they'd like. Oh, and the schemaValidator function would be called anytime a field's model changed (based on a $watch). What do you think?\n. Oh, and just to be clear. schema is the FDD for the field and data is the model for the field (this would be field.model || what is passed to formly-form). Would that work?\n. That's a significant departure from the current API. It's also a little more complicated api as well. The simplicity of angular-formly is one of its strong points. I don't think that we want to change the default api to do this...\nHowever, I can definitely see the value. I think we may be able to detect that the given fields are a schema and generate the fields from the schema. So we'd do something like this:\njs\nvm.model = { /* your model here */ };\nvm.schema = { /* your schema here */ };\nvm.fields = {}; // set just so we have reference to it in our javascript\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"vm.model\" schema=\"vm.schema\" fields=\"vm.fields\"></formly-form>\nThen, formly would generate the fields based on the schema and assign it to your vm.fields and it would invoke the schemaValidator function with the schema as described above any time the model changed.\nI believe that the schema you recommended would be converted to something like this:\njs\n[\n  {\n    key: 'name', // property name\n    hide: false, // !defaultVisible\n    label: 'Name', // title\n    description: 'Your name...' // use placeholder if you want a placeholder\n    required: true // from required array\n    data: {\n      // anything that's not part of the JSON specification will go in here\n      maxLength: 60\n    }\n  },\n  { /* etc. */ }\n]\nPlease note, this does not at all change formly's default api. It may also make things a little tricky to do anything creative if you do things this way. I'm also not promising that this would actually be possible. But I believe it should be.\n. Would love help in the branch I started out. I'm not very familiar with this. I've pushed the 2.0.0 release anyway. We'll add this in a future version.\n. I think this should be part of a plugin, so I've created a new repo for that plugin. Anyone is welcome to implement it. https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-json-schema/issues/1\n. First of all, you're very welcome :+1: Glad you've found it useful!\nI'm not able to reproduce any issue whatsoever. No matter how much I change and move around, the field disappears when type is not equal to 1 which is the condition...\n. I'm changing everything I can. Here's what I see: http://cl.ly/3047330u1V19\n. So you're saying that when form2 is selected, you want type === 1 to show the text field and when form1 is selected, you want type === 2 to show the text field? I'm totally confused... What are you trying to accomplish?\n. Oh, I get what's going on. One gotcha with formly (that should probably be documented) is that you can't re-use the exactly same fields between multiple forms. Another thing that you should avoid doing is using the same form for for multiple models. This is because when angular watchers are run, the model for the field may not be the model that you're expecting. So instead, for this case, where you have the same fields representing multiple models, I recommend each form having it's own copy of the fields and each formly-form having one model that doesn't get entirely swapped out (individual properties can be swapped of course, just not the entire object).\nHere's an updated (working) plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/z9SHYESTDGNHCN1bn0AX?p=preview\n. If this resolves your issue, please close it :-)\n. Sure, I copied the formFields upfront because I knew how many I needed, but you could easily copy them later, or create a function that returns a fresh copy of the fields. Like so:\njs\nfuncton getFields() {\n  return [\n    // your fields\n  ];\n}\nthis would also ensure that each instance of the fields is unique. Then just invoke that every time you need a new copy.\n. Well, that all depends on how many forms you've got... Let's move this to gitter so we can chat more quickly.\n. (\u00f3 \u00ec_\u00ed)=\u00f3\u00f2=(\u00ec_\u00ed \u00f2) Good luck!\n. ... Github... Messed up my emoji... (\u00f3 \u00ec_\u00ed)=\u00f3\u00f2=(\u00ec_\u00ed \u00f2)\n. I'm not sure I understand your question... It sounds like you know what to do. You have the right idea that you'll want to create a custom template for this functionality. From there you can do whatever you like. See the wiki on custom templates for what's available.\n. And what I was saying is that the option \"mask\" doesn't have to be implemented in formly for you to use it in a custom template. Either way, we're definitely not going to implement it in formly core as it wouldn't make sense. If you would like it added to one of the template libraries, create an issue there and we can discuss it...\n. What version of angular-formly are you using? The current version of master has significant changes from the released version. I recommend using the latest version in master as we'll be releasing this very soon and it comes with a lot of improvements.\nNote, that in the latest (master) version, the attribute has changed from result to model and the options attribute has been removed.\nJust by looking at your code, it appears you're doing everything else just fine. If making those changes doesn't fix your issue, could you please provide an example by cloning this jsbin template (File -> Clone)? Thanks!\n. Great! I'm glad you got it working. Let us know if you need any more help. Thanks!\n. So, just to confirm, you want the user to be able to check multiple of those right? Or are they limited to only one? If they're limited to one, then just use the radio button. If you just want to have one field label associated with multiple checkboxes (each with their own label) then you'll have to make your own template. I would recommend copying the radio button template and changing it to a checkbox. Like so:\nhtml\n<div class=\"radio-group\"\n     ng-class=\"{'has-error': options.formControl.$invalid}\">\n    <label class=\"control-label\">\n        {{options.label}}\n        {{options.required ? '*' : ''}}\n    </label>\n    <div class=\"radio\"\n         ng-repeat=\"(key, option) in options.options\">\n        <label>\n            <input type=\"checkbox\"\n                   formly-dynamic-name=\"id + '_'+ $index\"\n                   formly-custom-validation=\"options.validators\"\n                   id=\"{{id + '_'+ $index}}\"\n                   aria-describedby=\"{{id}}_description\"\n                   ng-value=\"option.value\"\n                   ng-required=\"options.required\"\n                   ng-model=\"$parent.model[$parent.options.key || $parent.index]\">\n            {{option.name}}\n        </label>\n        <p id=\"{{id}}_description\"\n           class=\"help-block\"\n           ng-if=\"option.description\">\n            {{option.description}}\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n. @maryampashmi, it's because you have the hiddenWhenUnchecked field as part of the options of the checkbox-template field. Also, unless your template is doing something interesting/odd, options shouldn't have a key. Your hide expressionProperty should reference Q2 being the value of the more option. Try this:\njson\n{\n    \"key\": \"Q2\",\n    \"type\": \"checkbox-template\",\n    \"label\": \"What are the most important language to learn?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"english\",\n        \"value\": \"eng\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"spanish\",\n        \"value\": \"spnsh\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"french\",\n        \"value\": \"frnch\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"more\",\n        \"value\": \"more\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": \"hiddenWhenUnchecked\",\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"line\": 4,\n    \"label\": \"Please write down if you consider another languages\",\n    \"placeholder\": \"chinese\",\n    \"expressionProperties\": {\n      \"hide\": \"model.Q2 !== 'more'\"\n    }\n  }\nIf that doesn't work, please provide an example using this jsbin as a template.\n. @maryampashmi, did this resolve your issue? Please close this issue if so.\n. Good point. I'm actually in the process of creating a series on egghead.io for angular-formly. Stay tuned! :D\n. What you're experiencing is why the pre-built templates don't support ng-pattern already. You have a few options. You can either:\n1. Create a custom template that uses ng-pattern (called pattern-input for example) and just use it when you need to supply a pattern\n2. Use a validator instead (I recommend this) where you validate it based on regex.\nGood luck\n. @rahil471, did this resolve your issue? Please close this issue if so.\n. Closing this. Let me know if your issue was unresolved.\n. Whoops, can't believe we didn't see that earlier. I'm not certain that it's worth fixing at this point. I'll be releasing 2.0.0 in the next week or two anyway. Also, master and 1.0.0 have some significant differences. So if you're trying to compare your code with the two, you're going to have a hard time.\n. Good question... Unfortunately, this is not currently possible, though I wanted it to be #132.\nHowever! I closed #132 because there's a reasonable workaround. From the #132:\n\nThis can be accomplished by specifying a model for the field like so:\njs\n$scope.foobar = {\n  foo: {\n    bar: 'hello'\n  }\n};\n$scope.fields = [{\n  model: $scope.foobar.foo,\n  key: 'bar'\n}];\nhtml\n<formly-form result=\"foobar\" fields=\"fields\" />\nThis is supported as of 9f10f57\n\nHopefully that's a reasonable workaround for you!\nIf you want to take a whack at a PR to support 'name.first' that would be way awesome because I think it's a much better api. However, there are some issues with using getter/setters with ng-model-options (which I mention in my egghead lesson on it).\n. One thing that we may consider is simply syncing an internal value with an external value using $watch... This would avoid the use of a getter/setter... But that may not be the right approach...\nP.S. Thanks for angulartics! :D\n. There were big breaking changes from 1.0 to 2.0. But what's in matter\nshould be compatible with 2.0.

Also, if you've seen the new site, we're using jsbin to do examples now. Would love to see some LumX examples on there :-) https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/edit/master/demo/app/states/root/components/data/examples.js\n. Thanks. Maybe you can provide me with some feedback.\n\nI've been thinking about making a change to the field config api to make things more clear what is for templates and what is for formly core. So changing the api to be this:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'text', // or template/templateUrl\n  key: 'first',\n  wrapper: 'someWrapper', // new api in master, you'll love this one. You may actually want to build your templates with this and wait for me to release this officially. Should be in the next few days. Also, the api is not finished because I'm planning on being able to specify an array where the first wrapper would be wrapped in the second wrapper and so on :-D\n  model: vm.user.name,\n  expressionProperties: {},\n  data: {}, // reserved for users\n  modelOptions: {}, // currently created in formly core, but I'm thinking that we should pull it out and let this be part of the template\n  watcher: {},\n  validators: {}, // this is technically used only in the template using the formly-custom-validation directive. So perhaps it should go in the templateOptions? But I think that all templates that use ng-model should support validators so it may be better just to keep it here.\n  templateOptions: { // and here's the change. All template-specific options would be moved to here\n    label: 'First Name',\n    placeholder: 'Please be honest',\n    required: true,\n    options: [],\n    description: 'Enter your first name so we can know what it is',\n    // etc...\n  }\n}\nWhat do you think? I've presented on formly, and the biggest confusion for people was figuring out what was part of the formly core and what was necessary/supported by the template library. I think this api makes it much more clear. I'm anxious to get your feedback so I can make this change if you think it would be useful. We could then cut a 3.0.0 release. And don't worry, it wont drag on like the 2.0.0 :-) I'm speaking on formly at ng-nl next week, so I'll want to cut a new release before then.\nSo, anyway, I really like this new api. I think it's more clear. Let me know what you think :-)\n. Actually @ShMcK, I still want to keep type. I was just saying that you can still specify a type OR a template OR a templateUrl. With this new paradigm, you would have a templateOptions.type to specify a different type for the input template type.\nI'm working on documenting the wrapper api a little better. It's pretty cool. You can have wrappers in wrappers, which should make ng-messages and labels really handy! It's mostly tested and I'm going to have an example on the site for it as well so you should be able to figure out how to leverage it fairly easily.\nI'm going to leave modelOptions and validators where they are. I think it makes sense to keep them there.\nBut be aware that I am going to move all template configuration to templateOptions and I'm going to throw an error if anyone specifies a property that does not belong in the main configuration. Users will have free reign over both the data and templateOptions objects, but the rest of the field api will be limited to what is explicitly allowed.\nThanks for working with me on this as I try to make this the best forms abstraction for angular :-)\n. Note, I'm also changing setTemplate and setTemplateUrl to simply setType. Keep an eye on the README for that simpler api.\n. I've been having a lot of fun this evening making a bunch of changes. Most of them will simply require you to change from options to options.templateOptions. Also, there are several other nice updates as well (including wrapped wrappers). I recommend taking a look at how I altered the other template libraries (like bootstrap to see what changes you'll need to make. Also check out the changelog.\n. Also, be advised that I've released a beta version of this to npm. You can npm install angular-formly@3.0.0 to see it.\n. Terrific! I want to wait until your library is up to date before releasing the next version to make sure that you're able to go through and double check the api. I want you to let me know if I was just being crazy or something :-)\n. Hi @ShMcK, I'm actually in Sweden right now, but still suffering from jetlag. So sorry I wasn't available earlier. Here are a few things:\n- Hopefully the wrappers will be sufficient to help you avoid repeating yourself\n- options: [] for radio buttons are specific to radio buttons and are not needed at all by formly core. That's the basic premise of everything. If it's not common to all templates (ie, used by formly core) then it belongs in either templateOptions or in data (though data is more reserved for users, not template writers).\n- I thought about using template instead of the more verbose templateOptions. However, template is already in use because you can specify a template instead of a type or templateUrl\n- I'm thinking that perhaps it may be nice to have somehow a way that formly would attach the ng-required, ng-disabled, etc. directives based on the templateOptions automatically for you. But that would require a recompilation of the template which would likely lead to a performance issue. And I believe that formly actually already has poor performance sometimes so I'd like to avoid making it worse. But I think I would like to explore this possibility as it would make the templates MUCH easier to write.\nThanks for your work on this! Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to do. I think I'll look into that last point. If there's a way I can do this without hurting performance, I think I will because that would be great!\n. Excellent! :-)\n- Kent C.

A couple thoughts:\n- On the fm.formFields preview on the right, I would actually make a copy of the fields in your controller and display those. Formly attaches several things to the fields that are not entirely necessary showing (like model options or the form control)\n- Speaking of the form control, if you open your console, you'll notice some warnings complete with links to explanations. Look into those :-)\n\nIt could be that last one is related to the select components not working, but I'm not certain about that...\n. Just playing around with one of those selects, it appeared that it may have just been a css issue. I found the parent element of the dropdown and the opacity was set to 0. I changed it to 1 and everything started working...\n. @abodacs, could you be more specific? They seem to be working for me...\n. Well, I fixed it as much as I could, but the rest is up to jsbin\n. For now, you can click \"load unsafe scripts\" and that'll make things work for mixed https and http.\n\n. @abodacs, so the \"solution\" is to force non-ssl because the jsbin examples will come from the community and I can't force people to upgrade to jsbin pro (which is how you enable ssl for jsbin) so now if you come to the page with https, it will downgrade you to http... :-(\n. @abodacs, I would, except the original issue is still valid. I still want more examples on the site :D Feel free to submit a PR if you have time to create a specific example! :D\n. Thanks for the tip @JamyDev. I think that's a good idea. I'll try to get it in soon.\n. This is now supported: e29ad3dc37e46b9dbab7b05a77185b6396684e63\nNote: This is a breaking change and will result in a 3.0.0 release. I hope this release comes soon. Also note, with this 3.0.0 release comes templateWrappers which you're going to love if you use many custom templates :-)\n. To be more clear, it's going to be shipped with other breaking changes. I think the simple errors thrown wouldn't be a problem necessarily since you couldn't do this in 2.0 anyway, but I've got a bunch of other things that are definitely breaking changes that this will ship with. Should be a much easier migration from 2.0 to 3.0 than it was from 1.0 to 2.0.\n. Absolutely. You simply need to create a custom template and use those directives in your custom template. I'm actually doing this currently with ui-select.\nhtml\n<div class=\"input-group col-md-12\">\n  <div class=\"form-control\"\n       type=\"text\"\n       name=\"{{::id}}\"\n       ng-attr-placeholder=\"{{options.placeholder}}\"\n       ng-required=\"options.required\"\n       formly-custom-validation=\"options.validators\"\n       az-autofocus=\"{{options.focus}}\"\n       ui-select2=\"options.data.select2Options\"\n       ng-model=\"model[options.key || index]\"\n       az-ui-select2-disabled=\"options.disabled\"></div>\n</div>\nThere are likely a few things in there that you'd need to change from my example, but the concept is fairly straightforward :-) Good luck!\n. Also, if you do get this implemented, I would love to have an example on the website. Create an example by following the instructions here\n. @piernik, do we need to keep this issue open?\n. Thanks @metasean! It's been fixed.\n. I've got an idea. What if we gave you something like this:\njavascript\nformlyConfigProvider.templateManipulators.preWrapper.push(function(template, fieldOptions, scope) {\n  // do whatever you want to here and return the template. You can even return a promise\n  // this will be called before all of the wrappers have have run\n});\njavascript\nformlyConfigProvider.templateManipulators.postWrapper.push(function(template, fieldOptions, scope) {\n  // this will be called after all of the wrappers have have run\n});\nWhat do you think about that? I think I sort of like that. Would allow you to add classes or styles or even wrap it further. AND it would allow you to add all the ng- directives we were talking about automagically :-)\n. Saving template code is the main usefulness. But you need to make sure that\nyou're specifying the right types on the wrapper when it's defined or\nspecifying the right wrappers when the type is defined. That may be a bit\nconfusing....\n- Kent C.

Oh yeah, I was going to mention that. After looking at it, I think you definitely need to do this because it adds a few things to your fields that are necessary (including the key if one is not specified, and it adds the watchers). Without the formly-form, you'll miss out on a few things that I think are important.\n. I'm not sure I know what you mean by binding to model[options.key].fields.... The fields should not be on the model at all. I think what you really want is what you have above: fields=\"options.templateOptions.fields\"\n. Is there not a link with that error? There should be a url link to a wiki that explains why you're getting that error and how to fix it. I'm guessing this is the error you're seeing: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/wiki/Errors-and-Warnings#couldnt-set-the-formcontrol-after-timems\n. Basically, if that error is what I believe it is, you need to make sure that all of your ng-model attributes specify a name attribute or that the field config specifies noFormControl: true\n. And yes, I need to get some sleep :sleepy: \n. Yep! I appreciate you're help. We're building something awesome :D\n. @ShMcK you'll want to look at this commit: b02d0a652d956895e092125321196c0aca7969ab see the changes to tests, docs, and examples :-D You could also benefit from looking at these changes in templates bootstrap: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap/commit/1e7d12876318f9dd4406c6ade77de2f61019102b Your life should be much easier now!\n. @gboersma, I'm glad to see you keeping up with what I'm doing with the latest stuff. It helps me get feedback when people try to use stuff that I'm building :-)\n\nThe reason I've decided to create templateOptions (which is such a big breaking change) is because it became confusing to determine what (in the field config object) is used in formly core (ie common regardless of template) and what is used in the template only. By restricting what properties you can put in the field config, it makes formly's api more consistent and easier to use. Also, formly is now able to warn you if you use it incorrectly (currently, it throws an error, but I plan on changing that to a simple warning).\nPlease note! I have a huge application with a LOT of field configurations. I'm not looking forward to updating all of these. So, to ease things a little bit, I just barely created this tool which I hope should be helpful when updating your form fields :-) cheers! http://jsbin.com/ruwoke\n. Oh, sorry, and to answer your actual question, unfortunately I don't think that I'm going to be able to add a backwards compatible option. Hopefully the little tool I created will suffice. I believe it should be everything you need to update your fields to the new standard. If you're using custom templates, that's a bit of a different story. You'll need to update those manually. Good luck!\n. I will not include this logic in formly core, but it should be very reasonable to do yourself before you pass the options to formly. Depending on how things are set up for you, it may be easiest to use an http interceptor and do the conversion there. Obviously, this wouldn't allow you to keep your templates as they are. But it is likely that the template update bit is just a half hour change max.\nAs for the actual conversion function, because you're just dealing with json (rather than having to worry about functions) then something like this should probably do it:\n``` javascript\n// test fields using the old method\nvar oldFields = [\n  {\n    label: 'Field 1',\n    required: true,\n    key: 'field1',\n    type: 'text',\n    expressionProperties: {\n      data: {\n        dataProp1: '$viewValue.length > 4'\n      },\n      hide: 'model.field2',\n      disabled: '!model.field3'\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    label: 'Field 2',\n    key: 'field2',\n    type: 'checkbox'\n  },\n  {\n    label: 'Field 3',\n    key: 'field3',\n    type: 'checkbox'\n  }\n];\nconsole.log('before', oldFields);\nvar newFields = convert(oldFields);\nconsole.log('after', newFields);\n// here's the actual convert function\nfunction convert(fields) {\n  var copy = fields;\n  var allowedProperties = [\n    'type', 'template', 'templateUrl', 'key', 'model',\n    'expressionProperties', 'data', 'templateOptions',\n    'wrapper', 'modelOptions', 'watcher', 'validators',\n    'noFormControl', 'hide'\n  ];\n  angular.forEach(copy, function(field) {\n    angular.forEach(field, function(val, prop) {\n      if (prop === 'expressionProperties') {\n        for (var eProp in val) {\n          if (allowedProperties.indexOf(eProp) === -1) {\n            val['templateOptions.' + eProp] = val[eProp];\n            delete val[eProp];\n          }\n        }\n        if (val.data) {\n          for (var dProp in val.data) {\n            val['data.' + dProp] = val.data[dProp];\n          }\n          delete val.data;\n        }\n      }\n      if (allowedProperties.indexOf(prop) !== -1) {\n        return;\n      }\n      field.templateOptions = field.templateOptions || {};\n      field.templateOptions[prop] = val;\n      delete field[prop];\n    });\n  });\n  return copy;\n}\n```\n. @gboersma, do you think this will be sufficient?

Could you jump on Gitter really quick?\n. Do we need to keep this open?\n. Created a repo for this. Closing in favor of that: https://github.com/formly-js/formly-builder/issues/1\n. Formly doesn\u2019t wrap every formly-field in an ng-form, but it does wrap every formly-form in an ng-form is that what you\u2019re talking about? If you'd like to skip the ng-form, then I think this is doable. Especially because we're using es6 template strings it should be a breeze. I'll just have to move the template from a file to a function and allow you to specify an attribute that says that you don't want it in an ng-form. Should be very easy.\n. The api would probably be something like this:\n\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"vm.model\" fields=\"vm.fields\" form=\"vm.form\" no-ng-form></formly-form>\nThough, thinking about it now, I'm not sure why the presence of ng-form prevents rows/columns. Can't you just style the ng-form? You can add your own classes to the formly-form and it will be applied to the ng-form.\n. Closed with 3.0.3 208b851ebe886dd61c9311db08244bb330a91ce3\n. This is supported in version 5.2.0-beta.1. Thinking this will likely land. Here's an example\n. This is supported as of 5.2.0 :-)\n. Thanks @juristr!\n. That's not a common use case, but one way to accomplish this would be via the watcher. You might do something like this:\njavascript\nwatcher: {\n  expression: 'options.hide',\n  listener: function(field, newVal, oldVal, scope) {\n    if (newVal) {\n      scope.fields.splice(scope.fields.indexOf(field), 1); // removes the field itself\n      delete scope.model[field.key]; // removes the field from the model\n    }\n  }\n}\nI don't totally understand your use case, but doing this seems very odd to me and I would suggest finding another way to accomplish what you're trying to do.\n. Ah, I see, so you don't actually want to delete the property, you just want to change the value of the model. Well, the best way to accomplish this is likely still with a watcher but don't actually remove the field or use delete. Just set the value to null or an empty string. This is an edge case because the form's purpose is to represent the current state of the model, not alter it specifically. But if you wish to do this, I'd use watcher. Let me know if you have additional questions :-)\n. Oh, and please close this issue if you have it working and you're happy with the solution.\n. I'm not sure what you need more than this example for the template wrappers. I just added a new example for custom controller and link functions. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!\n. I believe you could specify the name of the controller as a sting as long\nas it's been registered with angular and it should work.

Dear @ShMcK, you rock. Thanks for being an awesome OSS contributor! Or, as @aaronfrost would say: a \"bridge builder\" :-D\n. @stefanzweifel, let me know if there's anything that could be changed about the core library to make this process easier. I agree that this is a common thing many people will want to do, so I want to make it as easy as it can be without complicating the API.\n\nAlso, I would totally love for a team like yours who's doing Foundation work to own the Foundation Templates :D\n. So, I've been thinking about this a little bit, what would you think of an api like this:\njavascript\nvm.formFields = [\n  { /* field config */ },\n  [\n    { /* field config */ },\n    { /* field config */ },\n    { /* field config */ }\n  ],\n  { /* field config */ },\n  { /* field config */ },\n  [\n    { /* field config */ },\n    { /* field config */ }\n  ],\n  { /* field config */ }\n];\nAnd then you pass the vm.formFields as the fields attribute on formly-form and formly-form would somehow logically group those together for you. I'm not sure how this would best be accomplished. But I like to work \"backward\" and consider the desired api first, then come up with a solution (I guess that's sort of the TDD style). Would this be an acceptable API?\n. I'm wondering what this would actually result in. Right now, formly-form just uses ng-repeat on the fields so they wind up being siblings of one another. I'm thinking that with this array approach, it might group them into a div with a class like formly-field-group or something. Do you think this would really solve the problem?\n. > it adds complexity to the implementation. Which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.\n:+1: to that @GuilhermeMedeiros. I think I may have misunderstood your other comment. But I think that formly can do a little more work for you and I don't think that adding the ability to specify fields as an array of grouped fields would complicate the implementation too much. But I'm still uncertain of whether this will actually solve the problem. Perhaps the issue in my understanding is that where I'm using formly, the label is on the left rather than on top, so putting fields in a grid layout doesn't make as much sense for me.\n. @GuilhermeMedeiros, I'm not certain that I understand what you're suggesting. If I understand it correctly, it feels like a bit of a more complicated API. Also, what you suggested with the formly-field is sort of possible because the formly-field directive exists (you simply need to provide the proper attributes). Anyway, I'm sorry if I'm having a hard time understanding what you're suggesting. Thanks for your patience.\n. Thanks @GuilhermeMedeiros! I would really appreciate any help you can give on implementing this functionality. Reach out to me when you think you've got time!\n. @stefanzweifel, perhaps. The thing is that there are a few \"right\" ways to do this I think which makes it difficult to decide which is the real \"right\" way.\n. So, looking for feedback. I'm guessing that the vote right now is to create a separate repository/module for this. There are actual several directives in the angular-formly module that could go into this category I think. Do you think that we should create a new repo called angular-formly-template-utils and use that for all of these utility directives? I'm also thinking that it may just be easier to stick in the formly-area directive into formly proper. I'm sort of torn and not certain of the best approach for this.\n. I've created an example of how to accomplish this on the website. I think that will have to be sufficient for now.\n.

Closed, thanks to @raibutera!\n. No, you're fine. angular-formly depends on at LEAST Angular 1.2.x, but if you have a newer version that's terrific! You just need to specify a resolution. With npm, I can specify angular 1.2.x as a peer dependency and you don't get this, but with bower, this is the best we can do.

Oh, ok. Do you need to reopen this issue then?\n. Thanks @jameswyse, I actually video chatted with Victor a little bit to talk about the formly api and I would like to think that had some sway on the decision to include a more imperative approach. Hoping that angular-formly will be rendered useless by Angular 2. However, my plan is to make the port anyway so people can upgrade to Angular 2 without the need to change their form configurations. Then they can migrate from angular-formly to Angular 2's built-in stuff.\n. Created the formly-js/angular2-formly repo. It's pretty rough, but I'm closing this issue in favor of that.

Not currently. I could pretty easily add an api like this:\n\njavascript\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'input',\n  validateOptions: function(options) {\n    // validate your stuff here, throw your own errors or log your own warnings\n  }\n});\nWith that, you could do something like this:\n``` javascript\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'input',\n  validateOptions: function(options) {\n    var templateOptionsCheck = apiCheck.shape({\n      label: apiCheck.string,\n      placeholder: apiCheck\n    });\n    templateOptionsCheck.strict = true; // must have all and no more than specified stuff\napiCheck.throw(apiCheck.shape({\n  templateOptions: templateOptionsCheck,\n  data: apiCheck.shape({\n    someProperty: apiCheck.any\n  })\n}, arguments);\n\n}\n});\n```\nOr you could roll your own api check stuff. What do you think?\n. So, in this scenario, formly doesn't actually care what you do. It simply passes you options and allows you to throw or warn or alert or whatever the heck you want. In my example, I'm using apiCheck.throw which will throw an error if the checks fail. I'm passing arguments because that's the api to apiCheck (the first argument is your check function and the second argument expects you to pass arguments) so it actually is using options though not explicitly as a variable.\nI suppose that formly could take a more opinionated approach, but I fear this would reduce flexibility.\n. Ok, the api should be pretty simple to setup. I think I'm going to make apiCheck a dependency of formly, and when that happens, you'll be able to use apiCheck by default because you depend on formly, so you'll get apiCheck. I'll make apiCheck injectable as well so you'll be able to simply inject it and not worry about where it came from :-)\n. Oh, by the way, this is supported as of 3.3.0 :-)\n. formly uses apiCheck internally to validate its own apis (like setType). So if you're seeing that it's because you're calling setType wrong or there's a problem with the apiCheck config for that function. I actually have a bunch of stuff locally around that stuff. If you can hold off for a day or so, I'll get it in and then you can play with it :-)\n. I think it'd be more like this:\njavascript\nFIELDS.map(function (field) {\n        formlyConfig.setType({\n          name: _prefixer(field.name),\n          templateUrl: _fieldTemplateUrl(field.name),\n          validateOptions: field.validateOptions || function (options) {\n            apiCheck.throw(apiCheck.object, arguments);  // <--- validateOptions key\n          }\n        });\n      });\n. I can see where what you're suggesting would be beneficial. Maybe that can be a feature added a little later down the line. Right now, you're responsible for throwing your own error or logging your own warnings.\n. There's an example for this now: http://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/#/example/custom-types/validate-options\n. Does this still need to be open?\n. You can add an expressionProperty for validation.show that returns true when you want it to show and null otherwise.https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/README.md#validation-object\n.

The line of code that browserify is looks at  (dist/formly.js which is the main in the package.json) actually looks like this:\n\njavascript\nformlyConfig.tests = false ? require('./formlyConfig.test')(ngModule) : null;\nThis is because I'm using webpack's DefinePlugin which will set that value to false when it compiles.\nThe error is coming from browserify trying to resolve that require statement, whereas the browser would never run that require statement, and when webpack builds, it's smart enough to know to not resolve it.\nSo the best solution (IMO) would be to figure out a way to configure browserify to not attempt to resolve that require statement.\n. @sgimeno, could you try this solution to see if it will work for you: https://github.com/zertosh/unreachable-branch-transform\n. Did that solution work for people? Does this still need to be open?\n. Closing this issue as there hasn't been any activity on it for a while. Please reopen if this is an issue in the future.\n. Wow @pmowrer, thanks for putting effort into getting this to work with browserify. I'm sorry that it's such a pain! Do you think you'd have a problem with simply using the minified file? That wont have the line that's causing the root issue here. I don't think you'd get sourcemaps for angular-formly, but hopefully that wont be a problem most of the time.\n. Closing this as it should be fixed in 6.0.0\n. I actually had a conversation with @mzabriskie about this the other day. He informed me that including sourcemaps in your dist is actually a bad idea for this very reason I believe. I think that I'll have to find another way to accomplish the good development experience (perhaps a different distributable file?) For now, you could point to the minified version which doesn't include sourcemaps. Thanks!\n. Yeah, I think that it's because I'm including sourcemaps. I'll try to pull those out in the next version (soon to be released)\n. Might have fixed this. Everyone who's using browserify, please do:\nnpm install api-check@7.2.3-beta.0\nnpm install angular-formly@6.4.2-beta.0\nRe-opening until someone tells me this fixes their problem. Please let me know asap :-)\n. Fixed and officially released in 6.4.2 :-) You're welcome :-)\n. Could you verify that this works as well (it should):\njavascript\nvar angular = require('angular');\nvar app = angular.module('anAppThatCanFinallyUseFormly', [require('angular-formly')]);\n. Note the edit: You shouldn't have to even require api-check because angular-formly will require it itself.\n. Here's the final steps (I'll put into the docs if someone tells me this works):\n1. install api-check and angular-formly via npm (NOT BOWER)\n   - npm install api-check 7.2.3 angular-formly 6.4.2 --save\n   - NB: No browserify shim or dependency listing in your package.json's browserify configuration object is necessary.\n2. in your javascript, require angular-formly in your module's dependencies array\njavascript\nvar angular = require('angular');\nvar app = angular.module('anAppThatCanFinallyUseFormly', [require('angular-formly')]);\n. My most sincere apologies @jameswyse. I just added apiCheck, so I wonder if you could give me feedback on it. How difficult was it to work with before you realized that you needed to make a bug? The whole purpose of apiCheck is to help you learn how to use the api. Unfortunately, the way I defined the api for this piece was wrong and that's where the bug comes from (I said it was a function, but it is actually an object of functions).\nAnyway, I'd love feedback on that. Thanks!\n. Oh, also, npm|bower install 3.3.2 :-)\n. Thanks @jameswyse. That's very... for lack of a better word... validating :-)\nSo, I just updated the Custom Validators example on the website to show an example of how to alter the default message using validation.messages. It actually heavily depends on how you implement ng-messages in your templates. If you do it like the example demonstrates, then you're invoking the messages.\nAlso note, that the example has also been updated to demonstrate the use of the formlyValidationMessages factory which may be of use to you as well :-) Let me know if you need any more help.\n. Very interesting. How are you creating your type? Here's the entire setType function:\njavascript\nfunction setType(options) {\n      if (angular.isArray(options)) {\n        angular.forEach(options, setType);\n      } else if (angular.isObject(options)) {\n        checkType(options); // <-- at this point, the options you pass are validated using apiCheck, so the name is definitely defined and a string here.\n        if (options.extends) {\n          extendTypeOptions(options); // <-- if you're extending then options runs through this function, but nothing happens to the `name` property\n        }\n        typeMap[options.name] = options; // <-- we're putting the `options.name` here.\n      } else {\n        throw getError(`You must provide an object or array for setType. You provided: ${JSON.stringify(arguments)}`);\n      }\n    }\nThat function should be using apiCheck before long, but anyway, I think you get the idea. My first place to check (and step through the code) would be in the setType function.\n. Are you still experiencing this issue?\n. Fantastic! :D\n. Hi @delaman, we actually use swagger at @alianza-dev as well. It's way cool. However, we don't generate forms based on it.\nI don't think that this belongs in angular-formly core. This would go very nicely as a formly-js library though. All that you would need is a function that converts the JSON from swagger into properly formatted fields. You could look at this example of how I did this to help upgrade people from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 or modify the code of this tool to make it work and turn it into a library. It should hopefully be fairly trivial.\nHowever, as I said, this is not something that belongs in angular-formly core. If you're interested, I could create a repo in the formly-js organization and give you commit access so you could build and open source such a tool. Let me know.\n. You're right, but you don't have to use ES6 if you don't want to. However\nyou want to code. Formly supports ES5.\n- Kent C.

Looks like another browserify issue consuming webpack generated code. Dah! This is super frustrating. What if you require the minified version? require('angular-formly/dist/formly.min.js')\n. I'm not sure how this could happen. Could you look at the source and make sure this line still exists: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/dist/formly.js#L18 and make sure that it's passed to all the modules. This is a very odd issue. I feel like if the script runs in the browser but not with your tool, then the bug is with your tool, not the library... But I'd like to do whatever I need to help this work for you guys.\n. I would like you to be able to use angular-formly on your new project too! Let me know what I can do to help.\n. @ShMcK, did you get it working? Does this issue need to remain open?\n. Ok, please let me know if there's anything that I can do on my end to make this work. Good luck!\n. It looks like you're creating the type properly. Could you paste your template?\n. Also, you don't happen to be here at ng-conf right now are you? If so we could meet up and I could help you in person.\n. So, with angular-formly, the template has access to some specific things. The scope of your template is not the same as the scope in your controller. So, anything you want your template to have access to needs to be in your field configuration under templateOptions. So you'd want to do something like this:\n\njavascript\n$scope.fields = [\n  {\n    type: 'date', // <-- the name of the type you created for the date-picker\n    key: 'selectedDate', // <-- the property on the model to bind to the value of the date-picker\n    templateOptions: {\n      dateOptions: {}, // <-- your date options\n      formate: '', // <-- your format\n      ... // <-- the other things you want to have access to in your template\n    }\n  }\n];\nThen you need to reference the options object in your template. Most of your stuff will be on options.templateOptions, but because this is a lot to type, formly gives you a shortcut called to.\nhtml\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" datepicker-popup=\"{{to.format}}\" ng-model=\"model[options.key]\" is-open=\"opened\" min-date=\"to.minDate\" max-date=\"to.maxDate'\" datepicker-options=\"to.dateOptions\" date-disabled=\"to.disabled(date, mode)\" close-text=\"{{to.closeText || 'Close'}}\" />\nNote: You don't need to specify ng-required because angular formly will add that for you automatically if you specify required as one of your template options.\nIf you need more help, take a look at this example and this talk\n. You're welcome @abodacs :-)\n. This is how angular treats models that are invalid. If you want to override this behavior then you can use modelOptions (only if you're using angular 1.3 or greater). Otherwise you'll have to use the $viewValue. Here's an example of using modelOptions: http://jsbin.com/zuqojo Let me know if this solves your issue.\n. Hi @paulvanbladel,\nBoth of these would require a custom type. There's an example of how to do this on the website. For the custom action, your type could specify a controller which would add the custom action to the $scope (here's an example of that).\n. Hi @paulvanbladel! Did you get this working? Does this need to remain open? Or can I help you out with anything?\n. I take it you got this working? Great! :D Let me know if there's anything more I can do!\n. @abodacs, an autocomplete component is pretty complex. There are libraries that allow you to do it pretty easily. Is there a particular library you'd like to see an example of integration with formly?\n. > and it would be great if it was in edit mode.\nI'm not sure what you mean by this...\n.

Thanks! :+1: \n. It has everything to do with what you're setting your options to. So your $scope.organizations is what formlyBootstrap will use for the options. I don't know how to help you. You just need to make sure that you're setting options to the right thing...\n. So, currently formlyBootstrap's select type doesn't support selecting the entire object as the model value. Feel free to submit a PR to support this or simply create your own select type (it's very easy to do).\nAs far as that array, I have no idea where that's coming from. If you look at the examples, that's not what is happening. Could you create a jsbin that reproduces the issue?\n. Everything you have here looks fine (pretty much a copy/paste of my example in many areas which is great). What does the DOM look like where the form should be?\n. Ah, your KeyRequestController is defined using controllerAs syntax (you're referencing this) but in your route, you're not specifying controllerAs: 'vm'. Simply add that to the route definition and you should be good :-)\n. What is the value of vm.locations after the request finishes? Also, it's best practice to not use $http in your controller. You should either use resolve in your route definition and/or use a service. If you resolve your dependencies into your controller, then this issue goes away entirely.\n. Hmmm...

Thanks @remy!\n. Thanks for the update @jesperronn :-) I've updated my comment.\n. Definitely useful. formlyBootstrap doesn't support this currently. I definitely recommend that you create your own type for select because you obviously have some extra use cases that it's not supporting now. I recommend that everyone create their own types anyway. I've done this and I'll put that below. Maybe it will be instructive (note, it's written in ES6)\njavascript\nexport default ngModule => {\n  const template =\n    `<select ng-model=\"model[options.key]\" class=\"form-control\">\n      <option ng-if=\"!to.notNull\" value=\"\"></option>\n    </select>`;\n  ngModule.run((formlyConfig) => {\n    formlyConfig.setType({\n      name: 'select',\n      extends: 'azBase',\n      template,\n      defaultOptions(options) {\n        const forWithFilter = `for item in to.options | azDynamicFilter:to.filter:to.orderBy`;\n        let ngOptions = `item[to.valueProp] as item[to.displayProp || 'name'] ${forWithFilter}`;\n        const {valueProp, displayProp, options: items} = options.templateOptions;\n        if (items && typeof items[0] === 'string') {\n          ngOptions = `item for item in to.options | azDynamicFilter:to.filter:'toString()'`;\n        } else if (valueProp === null && displayProp) {\n          ngOptions = `item as item[to.displayProp] ${forWithFilter}`;\n        }\n        return {\n          ngModelAttrs: {\n            [ngOptions]: {\n              value: 'ng-options'\n            }\n          },\n          templateOptions: {\n            filter: 'orderBy',\n            orderBy: 'name',\n            displayProp: 'name',\n            valueProp: 'value'\n          }\n        };\n      }\n    });\n  });\n};\n. If you want to add support for this in formlyBootstrap, please feel free to do so! I'm closing this issue though because this is not the formlyBootstrap repo.\n. Here's an example of how to do that :-)\nhttp://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/#/example/other/disable-submit-button\nLet me know if you have any other questions :-)\n. Terrific question. The problem is that the options.formControl gets set in the controller function which will only run once and then never again. The problem comes with the ng-if which rips the input field out of the DOM. If the field starts in the read only state then you'll get this warning because the field is not part of the form's formControls. If you set noFormControl then that will get rid of the warning, however the options.formControl will never be set and you wont be able to show validation errors, etc.\nHowever! Angular will watch for when a new form control enters the DOM (when an ng-if evaluates to true and has an ng-model in it for example). So, what we can do is watch the form's property for the form control and add it to the scope/options ourselves! Yay!\nHere's an updated working example :-) Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!\nhttp://jsbin.com/tinoxo/edit?html,js,output\n. By the way, I'm going to add this to our examples if that's ok with you. In the middle of making some updates to the website, but once that's done this will be part of the examples :-)\n. Closing this for now. Please feel free to reopen if I didn't answer your question :-)\n. This was just a test of issuetemplate :-)\n. Hi @maryampashmi! You simply need to include the apiCheck script on the page. If you're using script tags, make sure to add the one for apiCheck:\nhtml\n<script src=\"bower_components/api-check/dist/apiCheck.min.js\"></script>\n. Make sure that this script tag is BEFORE angular-formly.\n. You're very welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n. Yes, unfortunately this will currently not work. The watcher property is unique in that it is utilized in the formly-form directive, not the formly-field directive. The reason for this is that it allows your watcher to be active even if the field is hidden. However, because the multiField is iterating over the nested fields without using the formly-form (which it must to accomplish the advanced layout) so it is not able to take advantage of that property (sad day).\nHowever, I rarely use the watcher property in my own stuff at work because there's normally an easier/better way to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish. For example, in your templateOptions you can specify an onChange which will add an ng-change to your ng-model element. This may work just as well for what you're going for.\nIf that doesn't work for you, you can always specify a controller or a link for the field and do the watch there. Again, this wont be operative when the field is hidden... So you could get creative and make a field that has a template of template: '' and that has a controller or link. But that's a little crazy and I would be surprised if you needed to resort to this...\nFinally, there's always just adding the $scope.$watch in your own controller. Not awesome from a reusability standpoint, but that's an option.\nLet me know if you need any help with your specific use case.\n. You're welcome!\n. angular-formly is built entirely with webpack in mind. It would be significant effort to remove the webpack dependency. I'm curious to know why you have a problem how it's built...\n. I see what you mean. However, I think you've misunderstood. Even though angular-formly is built with Webpack, it's distributed using UMD, which supports AMD, CommonJS, and globals. For example, all the examples on the website are using basic script tags, so angular-formly will expose itself as a global in that case.\nPlease do some additional research to let me know why it didn't just work for you and I'll see what I can do to help.\n. I'm going to go ahead and just close this. Let me know if you still have issues with this.\n. Looks good. Thanks for your work on this! The one thing that I'll say is that you'll definitely need polyfills for things like map, and forEach, etc. But if you say that this is working for you in IE8, then that's awesome. I'll get this merged as soon as I'm able!\n. @koenweyn, you've guessed right :-)\n. @koenweyn, seriously, thank you for working on this. I really appreciate the help! I hope it's worth it for you!\n. Me too! Were you there?! Did I meet you?\n. Thanks for being a good bridge crosser/builder! :D\n. Definitely :D\n. Hey @koenweyn, I'm writing a blogpost that references this PR. Do you mind if I reference you in it? https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/78281ea47455\n. Thanks @rbfinch! Glad that you've found it useful. First, I should say that validators functions can return promises, so you could technically make a call to the server in your validator function. Would that solve your use case?\n. Sorry @rbfinch, I don't have time right now to look into this, and I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but I'll leave this issue open and try to get to looking at a better way later. I think I need a mailing list for people to help each other with stuff like this.\n. Mailing list? Fancy that! https://groups.io/org/groupsio/formly-js :+1:\n. @rbfinch, I do something similar. Do you think that there's something that angular-formly could do to make this easier for you? Seems like a reasonable use case that formly may be able to make easier.\n. @rbfinch, I'm going to go ahead and close this now. If your concern hasn't been resolved, please open it up again and we can chat :-)\n. Looking at that blogpost this is totally possible and would actually be easier with angular-formly. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time right now to create an example for you. Perhaps someone on the @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read teams could help out...\n. Cool! Have you tried just using the built-in fieldTransform feature?\n. Better if it were in a plugin. I won't bring this into formly.

You can either setup the watcher yourself, which may not be a bad idea, or you could use ng-hide instead of ng-if. That comes with its own set of issues. What do you think?\n. @rbfinch, do you think this is acceptable or should we work on researching a better solution?\n. @rbfinch, good news! I totally forgot that I did this, but I changed the way that the formControl gets added to the options based on this use case. It now uses a $watch and will add the formControl after the fact.

I totally agree with you, and think that you should wait for 1.4 to come out, rather than including jQuery (I think I have the same personal opinions). However, the project that I inherited was riddled with jQuery plugins, so I didn't experience this problem until I made the demo that you saw at ng-nl which is when I reported that bug.  :-) enjoy your beverage. I'm going to be sticking with water :-) cheers!\n. Just recorded 4 lessons. Should be up on egghead.io soon! :D\n. You'll see one of the new egghead.io lessons has been published :-) You'll find all (2) of the lessons on the documentation website enjoy!\n. P.S. More to come :-)\n. Another lesson is up! http://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/learn-angular-formly\n. Hey everyone! There are now 8 lessons on the egghead.io playlist and the Learn angular-formly page. Please let me know if there are specific topics you want to know about. Right now I'm using analytics to know which lessons to record next, but it's starting to get pretty even now. Squeaky wheel gets the grease!\n. Going to go ahead and close this, but feel free to keep asking for lessons on specific subjects. I'm still listening :-)\n. Hi @DevanB, I'm no longer doing anything with angular-formly, so it's very unlikely that I'll make any more egghead.io lessons about it. Good luck.. Thanks! :D\n. If I understand your issue correctly, this is by design. If you wish it to show errors, you can set validation.show to true, like so: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/force-show-error\n. I'm going to close this now. Please re-open it if this doesn't solve your issue or if you have further questions.\n. I'm sorry @cdbizone. I really have no idea what your issue is... Please be more specific about the issue that you're experiencing. From what I can tell, everything is working as designed...\n. Oh, so if you can hide the iframe based on the $valid property of the form. This is similar to how you would disable a submit button (except you'd use ng-if instead of ng-disable). Does that answer your question?\n. Ok, I understand what you're talking about now. So this is what I would do: http://jsbin.com/fivuqa/edit\n. Yeah, just barely noticed this too! I broke this in 5.0.0. Fixing now!\n. Thanks for creating the issue. I was just about to create one so I could reference it in my commit. Should be about 10 minutes or so before I have the fix released. Thanks for your patience!\n. Released! Thanks!\n. It's 5.0.1\n. Uh oh... Yeah, totally still broken\n. Give me a second... My test wasn't correct.\n. @ValentinH, thank you for your patience! This was pretty irresponsible of me. I promise this is not normal :-)\n. Ok, it's fixed for real in 5.0.2. Once rawgit's cache is updated, all the examples should be fixed. You can npm install angular-formly or bower install angular-formly (you may need to clear your cache)\n. Thank you for YOUR reactiveness in reporting the issue :-) Great! Please let me know if you need any help!\n. Thanks for letting me know. I'm working on a fix. Duplicate of #222.\n. FYI, this is fixed as of 5.0.2. Thanks for your patience!\n. Thanks! Let me know if you need any additional help!\n. Don't have time to explain, but angular-formly doesn't do well when you swap out the fields after it has rendered the form. I think that's what you're doing...\n. I'm thinking that #225 is what you're actually interested in doing, so I'm going to close this one.\n. Yeah, because it's invalid, it technically doesn't have a value, so angular wont update the $viewValue. This is an angular problem. You may just have to update the $viewValue yourself :-(\n. Great question... #168 is wondering about supporting this in the core... I think it may be nice. Basically it would require making a copy of the model on first render, then exposing some kind of function (probably on options) that could be called to reset the model to its original state. Would have to handle the model property of fields as well... Do you think that angular-formly is the right place to do that?\n. Alright, I think I've got this fixed. If you could please try this out, that would be great. I've made a beta release that has this feature. Please let me know if this fixes the issue for you. npm install angular-formly@5.2.0-beta.1\n. Sorry, should have given an example or docs. Here you go!\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/form-options/reset-model\n. Ok, that's good to know. It shouldn't break if your model is null. I'll fix that. resetModel shouldn't impact the actual field itself. That wouldn't make sense in the api. And I was thinking about adding a resetFields method, but I don't think that would really make sense either...\nLet me fix the null problem and then I think we're good to release this officially. What do you think?\n. There you go. Officially in 5.2.0!\n. Update, use 5.2.1 instead...\n. @SagiMedina, this is being tracked in #246. Unfortunately it's not as easy as you might think...\n. I think that you could very easily combine angular-formly with angular-wizard. Let me see if I can make an example sometime. Or, if you want to, feel free to try making one yourself\n. Added an example of integrating this with angular-wizard by @mgonto: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/angular-wizard\nI think that's the best we can do right now.\n. This looks awesome! Thanks for the contribution!\n. Still accepting new submissions! But it's on the angular-formly-website repo and I want to clean up these issues.\n. :+1: \n. ping @mikeerickson :-) weekend project? ;-)\n. ping? :-)\n. :P, I'll stop bugging you about it.

That'd be an awesome addition to the library.\n. Maybe this weekend @mikeerickson? :-)\n. I'm cleaning up issues and it doesn't look like this one's going to happen. Feel free to prove me wrong!\n. angular-formly does a lot of stuff to render your fields and it doesn't to great when you modify the fields after the initial compile (as @ValentinH has discovered as well). I'm starting to think that modifying fields order/entirely after compile may be something I need to look at supporting better.\n\nFor now though, perhaps you could describe what you're trying to accomplish and I can give you a useful work around.\n. That sounds awesome! Would you like to build this? I would totally love that!\nFor your case, I think you may just want to recompile things every time you change something. Take a look at kcd-recompile\n. The problem is that some templates use singly bound expressions (like ::to.label) for example. So with those, you HAVE to recompile the entire template. So kcd-recompile should help you with that.\n. I would do something like:\nhtml\n<div kcd-recompile=\"newFormClone\">\n  <formly-form model=\"newFormData\" fields=\"newFormClone\">\n    <button ng-hide=\"newForm.length==0\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" ng-    click=\"onSubmit()\">Submit</button>\n  </formly-form>\n</div>\nThen I would alter kcd-recompile to use a deep watch.\n``` js\nangular.module('kcd.directives').directive('kcdRecompile', function($compile, $parse) {\n  'use strict';\n  return {\n    scope: true, // required to be able to clear watchers safely\n    compile: function(el) {\n      var template = getElementAsHtml(el);\n      return function link(scope, $el, attrs) {\n        var stopWatching = scope.$parent.$watch(attrs.kcdRecompile, function(_new, _old) {\n          var useBoolean = attrs.hasOwnProperty('useBoolean');\n          if ((useBoolean && (!_new || _new === 'false')) || (!useBoolean && (!_new || _new === _old))) {\n            return;\n          }\n          // reset kcdRecompile to false if we're using a boolean\n          if (useBoolean) {\n            $parse(attrs.kcdRecompile).assign(scope.$parent, false);\n          }\n      // recompile\n      var newEl = $compile(template)(scope.$parent);\n      $el.replaceWith(newEl);\n\n      // Destroy old scope, reassign new scope.\n      stopWatching();\n      scope.$destroy();\n    }, true); // <-- that\n  };\n}\n\n};\nfunction getElementAsHtml(el) {\n    return angular.element('').append(el.clone()).html();\n  }\n});\n``\n. This worked \"like a charm\" for @joezhouOxford in https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/246#issuecomment-95852663 so I'm going to close this issue. Let me know if there are further questions\n. I didn't realize that 1.2 didn't support$touched`. Nice catch. Thanks! I like the second recommendation. Would love the PR :-)\n. Thanks for the PR, but I neglected to merge it before I made some changes that made it difficult to merge (my bad!). Sorry about that! Thanks for providing the answer! This is now supported in 5.1.1\n. The docs are available for me...\n\n. @pmowrer, thanks for the issue. I had intended on fixing this because I was upgrading my own app to the beta versions, but I forgot. I'll have this fixed shortly.\n.

Ok, this and several other things (see the changelog) have been changed in angular-formly 6.0.0-beta.2. If you could please try this out, that would be great. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Missed that. Glad I only did this in a beta release :-)\n. It's been updated in 6.0.0-beta.4. Anything else you'd like to see changed in a major version change?\n. Alrighty, officially released in 6.0.0 :-)\n. Thanks for letting me know. apiCheck just had a breaking change and I forgot that all the examples run off of master. I'll go fix those now!\n. Fixed. Thanks again! I really need to develop a better way to keep all of the examples dependencies in one place. It may be nice to have them all run on the latest stable version somehow...\n. :smiley: haha! which talk did you see?\n. Haha! The exercise lives on! Thanks for using angular-formly. Please let me know if you have any other needs!\n. The expressionProperties are formlyExpressions. See the docs here: http://docs.angular-formly.com/v5.2.1/docs/formly-expressions\n. Let me know if you need more assistance :-)\n. @hmendezm, the best way to get help is to create an example using http://help.angular-formly.com. Just looking at your code, it appears that it should work fine. So an example is more helpful.\n. Wait, so are you trying to do this?\n. Ah, maybe this will point you in the right direction: http://jsbin.com/yubato/edit?js,output\n. Yes, this is totally possible! And I recommend doing things this way too! :-) Personally, I use the data property for the parameters, but you can do it however you like. You'll use defaultOptions which can be an object or function. Here's an example.\n\nPlease reopen this issue if you need more help.\n. It's loading fine for me. But you're not the first one to mention issues today. I wonder if iwantmyname.com is experiencing issues... Can you look at the network tab and see if there are DNS issues?\n. Wait, just to confirm. For you, the site is actually working, but the embedded examples are failing, is that right?\n. Ok, then it sounds like your computer is having difficulty with jsbin... This could be the result of a few issues. Perhaps your IP address has been blacklisted (that's happened to me before). ping @remy\n. Thanks for telling me about the view which excludes whitespace. Otherwise I would have looked at this and just been like: \"dude, there's no way I can review this thing... sorry\" haha.\nI actually really like it. Though I really like to require my test inside the file that I'm testing, I think for a small project like this, it's not really that big of a deal. It should also resolve #186 which is a plus.\nIf you could make the few updates I mentioned, I'll pull it down and double check everything, then I'll make this part of the official 6.0.0 release. Thanks!\n. Thank you for the PR! I think this is going to be a good change.\n. I found a few jshint issues. Also, when minified, ng-annotate doesn't annotate the functions properly. Could you add the @ngInject annotation to the injectable functions please? Then I think we'll be good to merge this in! Thanks!\n. I rebased these changes locally and pushed! These changes are live in 6.0.0-beta.8! Thanks a ton!\n. The problem is that angular-formly does a lot of things to your fields at compile time. If you reassign the fields after the form has been compiled, then that will cause a problem for you (as you can see).\nSo, instead of changing the fields, create another formly-form that will receive those new fields when they arrive. Put this behind an ng-if=\"theNewFields.length\" so it only gets compiled when those fields are assigned.\n. Thanks! Let me know if there's anything I can do to make things easier for you!\n. Love it! Thanks! You've been an awesome contributor (bridge crosser/builder)!\nLooking at the commits, it looks like you have a few extra commits in there which are bringing your repo up to date with angular-formly. Would really appreciate this PR to be a single commit to keep the history clean. Could you resubmit a new PR that just has a single commit with the changes? Thanks again!\n. The quick and easy way is to just delete your fork and refork :-)\n. Thanks a ton! This is great :-)\n. I'll have the example on the site next time I update (should be later today)\n. This has been deployed! http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/toggle-required\nThanks!\n. Thanks for using formly! You're not alone with this issue. Normally I've just explained that formly does some stuff at compile time and you can't just switch out the fields, but now I'm starting to think that this is a pretty common use case and people need this to work more seamlessly. So, I'm going to see how we can make this work with angular-formly without workarounds. I'll keep you informed.\n. Started work on this. Not sure how I'm going to accomplish it. It's in this branch. Feel free to take a look if you want :-)\n. Unfortunately a workaround like that wouldn't work. The validation issue is a side-effect of the real issue which is that the new fields aren't initialized properly.\n. Another workaround would be something like this. I have a branch (as mentioned above) that I'm working on to make this possible by reinitializing the fields manually. This may be possible. But it will be a little difficult. Still more work to be done there.\n. whoops, this issue is still open and I'm still working on it...\n. @s992, that sounds like a reasonable solution for most use cases. I'll get this in as soon as I am able (probably by tomorrow). Thanks for your patience!\n. Note: master has the unreleased 6.1.1. Please see the Changelog. The track by behavior changed (defaults to nothing), and you can also now specify your own track by:\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"model\" fields=\"fields\" track-by=\"$index\"></formly-field>\nor \nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"model\" fields=\"fields\" track-by=\"field.key\"></formly-field>\nor\nhtml\n<formly-form model=\"model\" fields=\"fields\" track-by=\"vm.trackWhateverIWant(field)\"></formly-field>\nI'm now waiting on @s992 and @n0rb to tell me how this supports your use case before I do an official release. Thanks!\n. If you do break it, feel free to add a failing test and I'll take it as a challenge :-)\n. So, I just realized that by adding this new functionality, it actually allows you to totally swap out fields! I had no idea that the track by $index was the culprit here! Please still let me know when you've tested it out, but I'm pretty confident that between this test and these tests we should be covered :-D\n. Thanks!\n. I'm guessing that you figured out the issue because you closed it correct?\n. Busy right now. Will probably have to wait until tomorrow to get to this. Thanks a ton!\n. I'm going to close this. Code coverage is now supported. Still working on coveralls integration (travis is having trouble) but you'll be pleased to hear that we're actually pretty well covered.\n. Looking at the report it's actually only reporting on the index.test.js file which contains all of angular, api-check, and angular-mocks, as well as angular-formly... Do you know of any way to make the coverage plugin leverage sourcemaps or something to make sure that 1) we're only reporting coverage for angular-formly files and 2) it reports coverage for the specific files, not just the entry file?\n. Thanks! You're awesome! :-)\n-Kent C.

I think I've figured out a way to get coverage to exclude non-library related files. I tried it out in angular-scope-types (WIP). Just need to take the time to do it in angular-formly.\n. Finally done!\n. Hmmm... Sounds interesting. Do you think that you could provide an example use case for me so I understand what you're trying to accomplish?\n. By the way, I'm thrilled that you're using this feature. I'm pretty sure it's one of the coolest features of angular-formly that few people understand/know how to use. It's pretty dang powerful.\n. Ah, I see what you're saying... One second...\n. Check it out :-) http://jsbin.com/xeguxi/edit\n. Note! For the love of everything good in the world. Don't go deeper than 3 levels of extends :-)\n. Dude, you're awesome. Thanks! This will be in the next beta release of 6.0.0. Thanks!\n. This is a tough one... What version of angular are you running?\n. Ok, this is the best I can do. And it only works in angular 1.3 ... Will that work for you?\n\n`` javascript\nit(should allow the user to specify their own name for the form, () => {\n  compileAndDigest(\n\n\n\n\n\n  `);\nexpect(scope.parent).to.have.property('formly_0_in_my_ng_repeat');\n  expect(scope.parent).to.have.property('formly_1_in_my_ng_repeat');\n});\n``\n. Doing this would be possible with angular 1.2, but it would involve completely recompiling the entire template once the correct ID was generated. This would be enough of a performance hit that it wouldn't make it worth it I think. I'm just hoping that you're using 1.3 right now... :-)\n. Note, the way it works is it sets thenameattribute of theng-formto{{::'formly_' + ${attrs.bindName}}}. The reason this only works in >= 1.3 is in 1.2, thename` attribute can't be dynamic. :-(\n. Here's the implementation: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/commit/94f82860310c5ae0d3ec17ea0c4427b0d252d6b4\nLet me know what you think, or if you think there's another way to accomplish this...\n. Ok great. I'll merge it in then. Thanks for providing a failing test. That was awesome.\n. This is now part of 6.0.0-beta.10. Hoping to get out of beta soon. Still working out a few kinks.\n. This is closed as illustrated in the test! Let me know if you have trouble!\n. Good catch! Thanks @sparty02! You don't think this needs to be officially released do you? It doesn't cause an issue for consumers of the library right?\n. Ah yes, it actually DOES need to be there so it will install (specifically in future versions of npm when npm doesn't auto-install peerDependencies). So I'll go ahead and fix it and release a new version for good measure. Thanks!\n. While that's true, the problem with making it a dependency is that when I npm install angular-formly it will add api-check to node_modules/angular-formly/node_modules/api-check. But if I want to use api-check in my own project as well, then I will run npm install api-check which will install it in node_modules/api-check. Now I have two versions of api-check in my app.\nPeer Dependencies was created to solve this problem. Not only does it prevent me from having duplicate dependencies, but it also provides me the freedom of choosing which version of the dependency I want (as long as it satisfies the peerDependency which angular-formly enforces to ensure it works properly).\n. I'm starting to feel alone in the \"I love peerDeps\" camp... haha, several tweets and rage posts about them. I've never run into the problems that others seem to have run into. Perhaps you're right. I may consider it a bug fix as part of 6.0.0...\n. Re-opening so I keep this on my mind.\n. Max, I'm not sure I understand what you're suggesting. So, are you\nrecommending that we stick to peer dependencies?\nI'm leaning toward leaving angular as a peer dependency and moving apiCheck\nto a normal dependency.\n- Kent C.

It depends on Angular (obviously) and a Vanilla JS library I wrote called api-check. So, in a sense, it's an angular \"plugin\" that has an extra dependency.\nI'm now thinking that I want to continue to have as loose requirements as possible for peerDependencies so I keep the warnings. But I'm thinking that maybe I'll include dependencies so the dependencies are installed by default. Then consumers can simply use npm dedupe to deal with duplicated dependencies.\nI just don't like the idea of forcing people to do something extra to consume my library, but in npm@3 the peerDeps wont be installed by default anymore so they'd have to install those deps themselves anyway. So I'm torn.\nAlso, there are several template libraries for angular-formly that depend on angular, angular-formly, and api-check. And the angular-formly-templates-material library will also depend on angular-messages, angular-aria, and angular-material. Should all of those be peerDeps and/or regular deps?\nJust want to do the thing that allows the most flexibility and ease-of-use for consumers of the library. I may create a blogpost based on what I decide to do.\nThanks for any advice you can give @linclark :-)\n. Awesome. I think that npm is going to with the package management game for all of JavaScript (at least, I really want it to). So this would be awesome.\nSo am I safe to say that for now, for frontend modules, dependencies should always be listed as peerDependencies with as loose version requirements as possible?\nFor now, I think I'll just use peerDependencies. I'll also have them as devDependencies so I can do my testing during development, but that shouldn't impact users of the module so that's no problem.\nThanks for the help @linclark.\n. Going to stick with really loose requirements on the peerDependencies and require you to install the dependencies yourself when npm@3.0.0 comes out. #knowyourdependencies :-)\n. Thanks!\n.

Thanks. The example has been updated. Let me know if it is not sufficient.\n. @abodacs That key is specific to that example. But it's because the key for the field, that's why it needs to be on the model.\n. This is a bit of a poor example. But part of the repeatSection type depends on their being a value initially because it copies the previous section to make the next one. It fails when there's not an existing previous value. You could easily alter the type so this doesn't happen.\n. I updated the example. Go ahead and play around with it. Should work now.\n. Migrated: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/issues/21\n. Are you loading api-check before you load angular-formly?\n. Thanks for checking on that. Do you think you could create an example of the issue using this jsbin as a template?\n. Thanks! Thanks for enduring the pains of upgrading. Looking forward to your example.\n. I just noticed this is a small app I was upgrading and it happened because I didn't change the script tag that's loading apiCheck. In apiCheck 7.0.0, the name of the file changed from apiCheck.js to api-check.js. Make sure that you've updated the file you're loading.\n. Good point. It's likely that most angular-formly users think little to nothing about api-check. Thanks for the feedback.\n. So, I think the better solution would be to make this render faster. If you look at ng-stats with logDigest turned on, you'll see that when you render a form, there are a TON of digests that run. We need to figure out why that is and see if we can make it so only one digest runs. This is high on my priority list because the initial compile of the form fields is just really terrible and needs improving. I'll keep you informed of my progress.\n. That wont be necessary... I have a pretty good working example locally that I'm working though. I think the main trouble is simply the way angular works... But I'm confident that we can find a work around to make this much faster.\n. First off, I should say that I'm not going to implement the original question. Not only is it the incorrect way to go about solving the problem, it's also pretty much impossible without some bad hackery against angular.\n\nSecondly, if anyone wants to contribute to this at all, see this branch where I've started trying to setup some kind of benchmark to test out how to make it faster. Again, I think that it's just an angular problem... Need to figure out a good workaround...\n. By the way. If you would like to be notified when all fields have finished loading, then you could implement something that would probably work by adding a custom link function to all your fields by creating a custom type that all of your other field types extend. Then in that link function, you have access to the field scope which has an options property for the specific field and a fields property for all the fields of the form. Set something on the options.data property to say that the specific field has been loaded, then iterate through the fields to see if all of the fields have had that property set. If they have, then fire an event.\nAs I said, this is a terrible way to go about this. Also, the UI thread is still going to be tied up with angular's digest cycle (so users will likely notice that), but it at least gets you what was originally requested...\n. I'm not sure what you mean by that last bit there...\n- Kent C.

Changing the name of this to resemble what the solution will be. Also, if anyone wants to take a whack at a solution, I've created this example which demonstrates where formly falls over (though, to be honest, I think it's more of an angular problem than a formly problem).\n. @pedrocatre, take a look at using ng-stats to do a quick manual benchmark of the performance of your page with > 100 fields. The idea behind formly is that you only pay for watchers that you absolutely need. So, even though it takes angular a while to compile the template in the first place, you should end up with the fastest possible output for forms using angular.\n\nIt is my expectation that you can't build a faster form with angular even if you hard-coded the HTML it produces. I have never tested this though. I do expect that a hard-coded version would be marginally faster, but not enough to justify not using angular-formly. I would love it if someone verified my expectation. If it turned out incorrect, it would give me hope that there's something formly can do to speed things up.\n. Note, you can use ng-model-options with formly using the modelOptions property.\n. Hoping to work on this soon. I have s lead that looks promising...\n- Kent C.

I think that the problem may be the promise chaining in the link function of a formly-field: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/src/directives/formly-field.js#L187\n\nI believe it's because on every resolve, there's a $digest due to the $q library. I reached out on twitter and got a few tips that lead me to develop these different examples\nCurrent: http://jsbin.com/kudixe/edit \n$$q: http://jsbin.com/fikeku/edit \nNative Promise: http://jsbin.com/pizizi/edit \nUnfortunately, I don't think that these are making a difference currently. I welcome anyone to try variations of this and try to figure out how to fix the problem...\nTo try something out:\n- Checkout the repo\n- $ npm install\n- Make your changes (it's ES6)\n- $ npm run build (don't bother with tests, we can fix those later)\n- Create a github gist out of the resulting dist/formly.js\n- Use http://rawgit.com/ to get a url to your gist\n- Clone this template\n- Replace the formly.js file with your rawgit URL.\nDid it work?

By the way @cnaccio, that's a LOT of fields... I don't know if you'd get good enough performance doing it by hand with just angular...\n. you might look into the read-only example. Never used x-editable myself...\n. Hmmm, looking at x-editable, I don't think that the read-only example will really do it for you... I would probably just create a directive that integrates with x-editable, then create a custom type with a template that uses this directive.\n. @jvandemo, wow! Thanks for setting up the plunkr and the improved example with a setTimeout/$timeout. Unfortunately, I tried it out in my app and it's hard to describe but the user can visually see things getting rendered which isn't very pretty. Kind of a toss-up which is a better experience.\n. I should also mention, there's one place in particular where performance in my app is not so good due to a lot of fields being rendered. @paulirish helped me interpret some Chrome profiling output for it. Perhaps this will be useful to anyone trying to help speed up angular-formly: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSkfqoiZS203BG5hTELTt1GvyD1qc9rDXOpMym9IKlw/edit?usp=sharing\n. Also, I just want to say thank you to anyone helping on behalf of the many developers using angular-formly. Most developers wont come up against these perf issues, but for those of us trying to display many fields, this is definitely a problem. So thanks to anyone who puts time and effort into improving the performance of angular-formly.\n. One thing that I've toyed around with is perhaps compiling everything from the <formly-form> element down manually and then inserting it into the DOM after all the field templates have been resolved. I'm a little sceptical that this would really improve performance though. Just a thought.\n. @jvandemo, for the benefit of those watching at home, this is the code that we're talking about. I believe that this is the bottleneck of the render. It's inside of the formly-field directive's link function.\nHere it is with annotations\njavascript\ngetFieldTemplate(scope.options) // <-- get the template for the field based on it's template/templateUrl or it's type's template/templateUrl\n  .then(runManipulators(formlyConfig.templateManipulators.preWrapper)) // <-- run the preWrapper templateManipulators. This is an array of functions that can return a (modified or unmodified) template string, element, or a promise which resolves to one of these things. We $q.all a $q.when of each of them\n  .then(transcludeInWrappers(scope.options)) // <-- this will \"transclude\" (but not really) the template into any of its own or it's type's wrappers, similar in function to a template manipulator\n  .then(runManipulators(formlyConfig.templateManipulators.postWrapper)) // <-- like the preWrapper manipulators, just another place to put manipulators in the pipeline for maximum flexibility\n  .then(setElementTemplate) // <-- this is where the template is finally $compiled and inserted into the DOM\n  .then(watchFormControl) // <-- this is where we set up a watcher to add the NgModelController to the options. I would be very surprised if this was part of the problem in itself.\n  .then(callLinkFunctions) // <-- this is where we call the field's link function and its type's link function (and any link functions that type extends).\n  .catch(error => {\n    formlyWarn(\n      'there-was-a-problem-setting-the-template-for-this-field',\n      'There was a problem setting the template for this field ',\n      scope.options,\n      error\n    );\n  });\n. Tried commenting out the templateManipulators and wrappers and it made a marginal difference in the plunk but pretty much no difference in my app...\n. I feel like if there were a way to tell angular to pause digests for just a moment while this thing compiled, that would improve things. But that may just be me misunderstanding how compiling things works. Maybe @teropa could provide some insight there?\n. Yeah, I looked at that too. Unfortunately, you can still see the fields getting rendered one-by-one and suddenly appearing. I really want to find a solution where it's all suddenly rendered immediately. I just hope this is something that's possible with angular... Starting to wonder if perhaps changing this to not use promises would improve the situation... Unfortunately, the async api is one of the things that makes angular-formly so consumable.\n. Toyed around with the idea of having two different link functions and using one or the other based on some pre-configured preference. Most developers wont run into this, but if you do, then you may be willing to give up the niceties of the async api for improved performance (if that's what we'd really get by removing the async api...)\n. I think I understand what we think the problem is. You're suggesting that the problem is that a $digest is being called for every promise for every field (which can be huge as a single field could have as many as 10 or more promises). That's what you're suggesting, correct? I think that's what it is as well...\nWhat I don't understand is how putting those promises into a queue outside of the link function will prevent a $digest from being called after they are each resolved. The only thing I could think of to avoid that was to either use $$q or the native Promise (or a polyfill) and trying those didn't seem to make a difference.\nI think I may just be misunderstanding though.\n. Thanks @kentcooper (awesome name by the way). I've been wanting to benchmark this against doing angular forms by hand (without formly) to see if formly is any worse than regular forms. I always believed strongly that it wasn't much worse, but never had any evidence or tested the theory.\nTo be perfectly honest, based on what @kentcooper has said, I'm doubtful that we can improve the performance without doing some serious hackery-trickery with angular... It's not a formly problem, it's an angular problem...\n. Thanks for the help guys! I've spent a little bit of time trying to time things a little better. I'll have time to work on it more later.\n. So I was thinking that maybe the problem is the promise chain. So I created a new feature called syncMode which allows you to tell formly that you don't use templateUrl or need async support for your template manipulators. It's actually pretty neat. I have a branch for it if you're interested in seeing what it takes to support. Wasn't a TON of work... Just a bit of work... Here's the diff\nUnfortunately... It doesn't make a lick of difference... http://output.jsbin.com/tawaxa/edit\nI've all but determined that what's slow here is angular, not angular-formly... Someone please prove me wrong! Many apps need this to be faster...\n. Good point. Hadn't thought about disabling api-check for these perf tests. I'll add that to the most recent plunk...\n. Looks like it speeds it up by 2-3ms per field!\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/SyBNyZjF1XDo6wsDobj4?p=preview\nIt's definitely recommended to turn off api-check in production... To do so, see the api-check docs\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. If someone wants to try to figure out how angular-formly could be improved from a performance standpoint on something specific, that would be great, but I don't see this issue going anywhere at this time.\n. Let me know if this one's not enough :-) http://angular-formly.com/#/example/intro/introduction2\n. @wfsm, sorry, I renamed it: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/intro/codementor\n. oh, and here's an example of two fields not matching: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/matching-two-fields\nFor min/max length, you'd simply use:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'input',\n  key: 'whatever',\n  templateOptions: {\n    minlength: 4,\n    maxlength: 10\n  }\n}\n. Thinking this will make formly too complex to make it worth it. So I added the hide-directive attribute instead. If you want the expressionProperties to work even when the field is hidden with hide, then use hide-directive=\"ng-show\" on that form.\n. Was actually thinking of doing this already. Will be in 6.1.0 :-) in a few moments. Thanks for the issue!\n. This is now released! npm install 6.1.0 See the docs:\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/formlyconfig#extras\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/formly-form#attributes\nThanks again :+1: \n. @gmsewell6, please let me know what you think when you've tried it out. Thanks!\n. so, the placeholder can be whatever. That part isn't dynamic. But you can make it dynamic if you want to. And yes, you could reuse the object above. angular-formly is all about keeping your code DRY, so you could create a custom type that defaults the maxlength and minlength values as well. It's extremely powerful. Come at me with a specific use case and I can explain or show how you'd accomplish it with ease :-)\n. Going to go ahead and close this due to lack of activity. Please feel free to open it again if you have further questions/concerns/need help.\n. Make sure that you either include a template library or create your own type.\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.1.0/docs/custom-templates\nOn mobile otherwise I'd be more helpful. Let me know if you need more help and I'll help when I get on later.\n. I'll reopen this to remind me. Thanks!\n. Added. Thanks again!\n. I fixed the template. Could you try it again? Thanks for your patience!\n. Please close this issue if the template works for you :-)\n. Thank you for letting me know it was broken :-)\n. I haven't read through everything yet, but can I just say, this is a terrific bug report. Thank you!\n. Ah! You're right! The docs are out-dated. I'll update that as soon as possible...\nSo, angular-formly now comes equipt with a sweet new feature called the ngModelAttrsTemplateManipulator which will automagically add a bunch of attributes based on the config for the field. What's cool about this is it makes creating custom templates a breeze and saves on the amount of watchers necessary for a particular field.\nOne thing to note about this manipulator is that (with a few exceptions) it will not overwrite attributes that already exist in the template. So, if you specify your own name (for example) then it should not override your own name. I haven't looked at your example yet, but if this behavior is not what you're seeing then that is definitely a bug :-)\nI'll look at your example, but let me know if this clears anything up for you.\n. Alright! You found a real bug! I need to do some work to get it fixed. May be a day or two. But here's a workaround for now :-) Thanks for using angular-formly! I'll let you know when the bug is fixed.\n. The actual solution will be a fix in formly-field, not in the template manipulator. The issue is that the formly-field is watching the field id rather than respecting the possibility that a user could specify a custom name.\n. Alright, updated the docs! Now to fix the bug!\n. I think I've got it! Master has been updated and your bug reproduction is working as expected now. Let me know if I've missed anything. Once I get the ok from you, I'll cut a release! Thanks!\n. There is no solution that I have found in the open source world. But I can tell you that in my app, we actually don't use the pre-built templates and have custom templates. We use bootstrap for our columns and simply have a specified column width for all of our labels and our fields. And labels are a part of the fields via a wrapper. This is the result.\n\nI'll make an example for this when I have time. It should be trivial to accomplish using any css grid system (including flexbox).\n. You're very welcome! And thanks! I want formly to be as helpful as possible and it's rewarding to me when I see it being helpful to other developers.\nI take it that you don't need the example right away based on you closing this issue?\n. Actually could you move it to the angular-formly-website repo? Thanks!\n. Quick look on mobile looks good, but I'd like to verify before merging. Thanks!\n. Looks good! Thanks. I'm also going to add the ability to return a promise from these functions just to mirror all other apis.\n. Watch the first video on this page:\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v6.2.0/docs/learn-angular-formly\nToward the end I talk about this.\nLet me know if you have more questions.

Note, obviously, you've got some serious performance considerations, so you may need to take things at a bit of a different approach. If you have a bunch of fields with their own hide conditions, instead of paying for a watcher for each of those, create your own watcher and respond to model changes yourself (by setting hide on the appropriate fields).\n\nIt's not as clean and neat, but that's the reality of the performance situation. :-(\n. So I've now had time to actually read through your issue. For the headings, you might consider not using angular-formly and just coding that up yourself in the HTML. This would allow you to using ng-if without a problem.\n. @pedrocatre, yes, I do mean creating watchers outside of the JSON. This is because there's a watcher created for every time you have a watcher. And they all watch the same thing. It's just some extra overhead that may not be necessary.\nThe hide thing is not a bug. Basically, when the field is hidden behind the ng-if, it never compiles which means the expressionProperties never get set up and cannot run.\nI may be able to add a hideExpression attribute which could make life a little bit easier for you. It would not be a normal formlyExpression though. It could be a function or a string, but it would be evaluated on the formly-form not the formly-field so you wouldn't have access to the same stuff... But it should be enough for what you want (it'll have the model for example).\n. In the latest beta, I added a hideExpression property. Give that a shot.\n- Kent C.

Let me know what you think.\n. I'm not sure I understand what you mean... ng-repeat is working under the hood...\n. I think all you're saying is that you'd like a pre-defined type that does this. You don't want to have to define it yourself. Is that right?\n. I see... Well, types are a template concern. And templates are specific to css frameworks. Are you looking for a bootstrap template then?\n. As a side, I highly recommend that if you're going to be serious about creating forms in your app, you should create your own types. As awesome as the template libraries are, they can't beat the customizability required for a serious application. And types are so easy to create that you shouldn't have a problem with it.\n. I see. I think having that built-into angular-formly could be useful... I'll see if I can think of a good way to include that.\n. @jlowery457, I improved the example: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/advanced/repeating-section\n. If anyone wants to discuss a good API as well as a good implementation, I would love to talk about it. I'd really love to improve support for repeating fields/fieldGroups, but I'm not certain as to the best way to go about implementing it.\n. I recently added the functionality to specify a fieldTransform on a global/form level that I think takes care of the json schema issue and may cover this case as well. Have you had a chance to look at that?\n. Docs\n. Yes, this runs as one of the first things in the formly-form controller, so you can add/remove/modify any fields. Meaning what you send it can be total nonsense and as long as what you return is an array of valid field configurations, then you're good. I'll try to create an example as soon as I am able.\n. Is anyone still waiting for this feature? I'm sorry I haven't really looked into implementing it. It's not the most straightforward one to implement.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of someone creating a plugin.\n. Sorry I haven't responded until now. Been kinda drowning recently. I'm not certain what the problem is. Why don't you have a look at this example and see if you can get it working.\n. Ah, the problem is actually a jqLite bug that has been fixed in 1.4.x and I don't expect will be backported to 1.3.x :-( https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11038\n\nThe only way to accomplish the ng-repeat with ng-messages is to use 1.4.x or include jQuery\n. Oh, sorry, I thought you were talking about overriding messages set in the formlyValidationMessages service. Yeah, simply using the template wont work, but that's not a formly thing, that's an ng-messages thing. If you want defaults, use the formlyValidationMessages service. This is why you generally don't want to have any custom ng-message directives in there. Just the ones in the ng-repeat.\nI'll have to look at making sure everything works ok in angular@1.4.x. I was under the impression that it did, but I'll double check that. Thanks!\n. Hmmm.... It really depends on the experience that you want to give your user... I wouldn't say that either of those is necessarily the \"right\" way to tell formly about them...\n. So, what I would recommend is using a router resolve feature which allows you to make requests before a controller is loaded and inject the results into the controller. That way you keep your controllers as synchronous as possible. This is just good practice in general in my opinion.\n. Good question, should have specified. For some advanced layout stuff, I want to have a \"field\" in place just to have a node there with a specific class. So something like:\n{template: '', className: 'my-class-name'}\n. Right now, I have to do:\n{template: 'nbsp;', className: 'my-class-name'}\nLess fun...\n. It's actually not a directive, and it's never actually rendered.

Sorry if api-check is hurting your feelings. But it's for the best. Much better than going down a road for a few hours before realizing that you're using angular-formly wrong.\n\n\nAs for your question. First off, your config is wrong. I'm guessing this was just a copy/paste error or something, but you have templateOptions and expressionProperties inside the validators property... They should all be sibling properties at the root of the config object.\nSecondly, angular-formly doesn't support disabling validators. This is the first time I've heard of this use case... Perhaps you could describe what your use-case is and I can give you the right way to do it or we can figure out how angular-formly can cover your use-case better.\n. Yeah, a better way would be to not use expressionProperties and actually just set the value based on the state (create/edit). So when you create the field, before you add the validator, check to see if you're in edit mode. If you are, don't add the validator. Also, instead of using expressionProperties for disabled, just say something like: disabled: isEditMode or something like that. That's what I do. It's better for several reasons. Would that work?\n. something like:\njavascript\n{\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {\n    validateFoo: isEditMode ? undefined : {\n      expression:  vm.someFunc,\n      message: '\\'some message'\\'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n}\n. I do stuff like that all the time\n. Note, for people who are persisting their config to a database and need it to just work with JSON, then another solution would be to make checking the mode part of the validator.\n. Glad that'll work for you :+1: \n. In all honesty, I haven't done that for validators before. I'm not certain why that is causing you issues, but one thing that you could do is something like this:\n``` javascript\nvar myField = {\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {},\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n};\nif (!isEditMode) {\n  myField.validators.fooValidator = {\n    / snip /\n  };\n}\n```\n. Actually, you know what would be even better:\njavascript\n{\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {\n    validateFoo: isEditMode ? 'true' : {\n      expression:  vm.someFunc,\n      message: '\\'some message'\\'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n}\n. Hmmm... That's crazy.... That should totally work... (the undefined solution should have worked as well)... Try this:\njavascript\n{\n  key: 'foo',\n  type: 'input',\n  validators:  {\n    validateFoo: isEditMode ? {expression: 'true'} : {\n      expression:  vm.someFunc,\n      message: '\\'some message'\\'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    disabled: isEditMode\n  }\n}\n. http://jsbin.com/foramu/1/edit?html,js,output :-)\n. Haha, that's actually a common pitfall. But it's literally an angular expression, so there's really no way to get around it :-( Glad you got it working! :dancer: \n. :+1: \n.

I improved the docs for validation\n. Yeah, so if you're loading it from a server then you'll have to use the string version for your watcher and other expressions. In-lining functions as strings will not work (and would be a very bad idea). Here's an example that may be helpful to you: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/json-powered\n\n\nP.S. I recommend avoiding using watcher if you can. It's better to try to use expressionProperties. Mostly from a performance standpoint.\n. Let me know if that is enough to get you going.\n. Absolutely. Depending on the dropdown's templateOptions, you might do something like this: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/filter-select\n. Yes, I totally love js-data from @jmdobry. @jmdobry, would love to collaborate on a library that could convert your schema to mine and then back again so your users can use angular-formly and my users can use js-data. Would be amazingly awesome.\n. angular-formly is pretty versatile, but I made an example using is.js and it was pretty cool.\n. I also tweeted about it a few days ago. Found a few libraries there.\n. I actually don't think that I'll ever get to this. If someone else wants to do this, I'd happily help them get started. I'm going to go ahead and close this though as I don't plan on actually implementing it.\n. To, anyone interested in implementing this. I added a new feature in 6.14.0 that allows you to specify a fieldTransform function to convert a given field configuration into something that angular-formly understands. So accomplishing something like this should be a matter of writing a fieldTransform to convert js-data schema into formly field configurations.\n. This is definitely something that I want to make work. Give me some time to look into it later.\n. I created a jsbin for it to demonstrate the issue: http://jsbin.com/goduno/edit\n. Boy, you've really got me stumped... I don't know how to accomplish that design based on how angular-formly works. Could you describe the UI you're trying to actually build? Maybe I can help you figure out a work-around.\n. That shouldn't be too difficult to add I think... If you think that it would work and you need that functionality, then I may take the time to add it.\n. I don't think any drawbacks of having multiple formly-forms would be noticeable. If you wanted to make sure that formState was shared between all of the fields (in the different forms) then you'd have to make sure it was initialized prior to the forms rendering. Another thing you'd need to be aware of is that the fields property for each of the forms would be different. Not normally a real issue though. I think you've found a good solution. Do you mind creating an example for the website?\n. Ah, good catch. I didn't notice that. Basically, the last formly-form would overwrite the other ones. So you don't want to do that. Instead, wrap all of them in a single ng-form or form and specify a name on that and don't worry about specifying a form attribute on any of the formly-forms (unless you're interested in that specific form controller for some reason).\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. An example for the website would be welcome. Thanks @DrDanRyan!\n. I'm not sure I understand the problem you're having.

It's because you did something like this:\njavascript\n{\n  label: 'some label',\n  placeholder: 'some placeholder'\n  // more configuration options\n}\nWhen it should have been something like this:\njavascript\n{\n  // some configuration options\n  templateOptions: {\n    label: 'some label',\n    placeholder: 'some placeholder'\n  }\n}\nChange that and try again. If it doesn't fix the problem. Re-open this issue.\nAlso, I highly recommend you go through all the resources available on the Learn angular-formly page.\n. Please spend some time watching the lessons on the page I linked to you and\nlooking at the examples. They will answer most of your questions.\n- Kent C.

Could you please produce an example of the problem. It's very difficult for me to help without that. Clone this template to produce the example.\n. This appears to be a problem with how ngf-select deals with the ng-model and how angular-formly watches the model (the error is thrown when angular's doing dirty checking). I personally use angular-upload and have had great success with it. If you really want to use ng-file-upload, then please help me know what if I need to change anything in angular-formly to make it work. I'm afraid I don't have time right now to figure it out.\n.

The best way to get help is by following instructions here: help.angular-formly.com\n. chat.angular-formly.com is not a stack overflow room. It just forwards you to a chat room on gitter. It can be helpful for you to ask a stack overflow question with the angular-formly tag as well because sometimes the people over there can help answer your questions as well.\n.

Please remove all that history and just have a single commit with your changes.\nSecond, I tried your changes locally and it doesn't work on my mac. I definitely want to have a solution that works everywhere. I'm thinking that a good solution would be to have a single script that sets the environment variables for us and invokes the scripts. So it would be something like:\njson\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build:dist\": \"node scripts/run-script.js build:dist\",\n  \"build:prod\": \"node scripts/run-script.js build:prod\",\n  \"build\": \"node scripts/run-script.js build\",\n  \"test\": \"node scripts/run-script.js test\",\n  \"test:single\": \"node scripts/run-script.js test:single\",\n  \"test:ci\": \"node scripts/run-script.js test:ci\",\n  \"watch\": \"node scripts/run-script.js watch\",\n  \"start\": \"node scripts/run-script.js start\",\n  \"release\": \"node scripts/run-script.js release\"\n}\nAnd the scripts/run-script.js would actually set process.env.NODE_ENV before invoking the script. Do you think that would work?\n. Absolutely. Thank you for being patient and working at it. Much appreciated! :+1: \n. Closing this PR. I like the middleware approach you mentioned. Feel free to take a stab at a PR for it if you're feeling ambitious :-)\n. Actually, someone ran into this same issue on twitter the other day: https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/601765588533317632\nHere's an example with an explanation of what the problem is: http://jsbin.com/mepega/edit?html,js,output\nTL;DR\nDon't specify a form attribute on the formly-form with the same name. Just leave it off altogether or change the name.\nPlease re-open this issue if that doesn't fix your problem :-)\n. You have it, right in your template. It's the fc variable (which is a shortcut to the options.formControl variable).\n. Ah, I see what you're saying. @ckniffen mentioned this angular issue on Gitter the other day. The problem is that the formController's parent is $submitted but that property doesn't get propagated down to children forms. @ckniffen, do you have a recommendation on how to handle this? One thing I can think of is to $watch the $submitted state and set it on the child forms manually...\n. Awesome! Feel free to make a PR :+1: \n. What is your reasoning for wanting this? I'm a big fan of controller as, but I don't see a reason for it here.\n. I don't think that there's a way that we could do any better than that. And, as much as I love controller as, I don't see the benefits in this scenario. Closing this unless someone can convince me otherwise.\n. I can see the benefit of making it private (in fact, in my app, I never actually register any of my controllers with angular). But I definitely firmly believe that the benefits of controllerAs cannot be seen in a type's controller. And we're also supporting angular 1.2 still, so we can't switch to use it in our own internal directives.\n. Wish I had metrics on what version of angular people are using with\nformly...\n- Kent C.

I'll see if I can find time to debug this later, but you might try stack overflow...\n. Don't worry, it's actually not too painful to support Angular 1.2 right now, but I'm curious to hear how many people are using angular-formly with angular 1.2. I will likely eventually drop support, but when I do, it will definitely be a major version change, so you shouldn't be auto-upgraded. And I'll make an announcement (so follow me on twitter)\n. Closing. I don't think I'll be dropping 1.2 support for a while, it's really not a huge pain to support right now (though I do have some custom code for it that would be nice to get rid of). I'll comment in this issue if I'm thinking about dropping support, and don't worry, as long as you use a ^ or ~ in your dependency listing, I wont push a break to you (because it'll be part of a major version change).\n. Thanks for the input @PascalPrecht!\n\nFor everyone, updating angular-formly to drop support for 1.2 costs me more time than leaving support for 1.2 right now, so I think that I'll leave it as is because it's working well and doesn't hinder the experience of developers using the latest version of angular. But support for 1.2 will be dropped eventually for sure. But again, it will be in a major release version so as long as you're using exact versioning or you're using ^ or ~ you should be fine.\n. Yeah, I think that v7 will likely be the last version to support IE. I'll remove support for it in v8 (\ud83d\udc48 not the JS engine...) :-)\n. Nope, I think a normal $scope.$watch in your controller is the best way to\ndo that. You could also look into the watch property on the field, but I'd\nprobably just do a normal watch.\n- Kent C.

Would like to get some feedback on the API.\n. Hey @ckniffen, so, just to verify, is this PR what you want it to be? I haven't had a chance to pull it down yet, but I want to verify with you that you think this is the best way (rather than the directive approach).\n. Hmmm, yes... Good question... I'm thinking that we do the hacky thing. It's not awesome, but I think it's the best thing to do in this scenario.\n. Awesome! Thanks a ton. This is way cool!\n. By the way, thank you sooooo much for squashing this into a single commit. Makes the git history sooo much cleaner :+1: \n. Fantastic catch @koenweyn. I'll have a fix for this asap. The problem is that because the root el isn't a form or ng-form, there is no FormController but angular-formly overrides it anyway. Actually, the way I'll fix it should resolve some issues that people have had in the past... I'll let you know when this is fixed. Thanks!\n. $ npm install angular-formly@6.11.1 thanks!\n. Thanks for the test! I pushed it out as 6.11.2\n. Cool! As soon as it builds on travis, I'll merge it. Thanks for figuring that out. It was really bugging me. Haha.\n. Thanks @ckniffen, I was actually just about to say that the solution is either fix the bootstrap template so it handles this scenario or make an example of a custom validator that does require like people expect it should. What approach do you think?\n\nEither way, I'm moving this to the bootstrap templates.\n. Moved: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap/issues/26\n. Working on it now. Should be fixed soon. Note, I don't think that I'm going to do this for any of the template libraries. It would be far too much effort.\n. You should be able to get this in 6.11.5 and/or 6.12.0-beta.1. Enjoy!\n. I would like some feedback on this one from people please!\n. @dwolt, thanks for your perspective! The challenge is that there's some crazy code to make things work the way that people expect it should anyway. It also has been the source of several questions from people who've spent a few hours with issues related to this... Though, thinking about it now, some of those questions and issues would not be solved by this change anyway, so maybe I should keep the old code around...\n. This is significant a change. I'm about to release a few minor breaking changes in 7.0.0. I'm going to push this off to a different breaking release so people can benefit from the 7.0.0 release without having to pay the price for this change.\n. I like your suggestion @koraybalci. We could add a console warning to the formly-form directive and then remove it later in a major version. The problem is upgrading all of those examples would be incredibly painful. lol. It's funny that the thing that protects users the most from breaking changes is the effort it takes to upgrade documentation!\nWhat if instead we made the form controller optional to start?\n. I highly recommend you use controller as syntax. :-) good luck!\n.

Most modern angular applications don't need the name to be anything special, just unique. If you have this use case, you have a bunch of different ways you could accomplish it. My recommendation: create your own types, don't use one of the template libraries. I would say that your use case is not common for modern applications. Luckily, angular-formly is pretty darn flexible and creating custom templates is quite easy.\n\nYou could do this using ngModelAttrs, however it's a bit of a complicated API and I would actually just advise creating your own template to accomplish what you want in this case. It is intended that the id and the name are something that you don't need to think about and hence, the template libraries don't come with this capability out of the box.\n...\nThinking about it further... I think that it wouldn't be unreasonable to bring this functionality into angular-formly. Currently, you can specify your own id as part of the field configuration object. This will be propagated to both the field's id as well as its name. I don't think it's unreasonable to allow you to specify a name property as well which would be used for the field's name if present, otherwise it would default to the id... What do you think?\n. You've convinced me. I'll try to get to this asap.\nFor anyone looking to contribute, here's a high-level of what needs to be done:\n1. Write a few tests (probably here):\n   - name (on both the options object and on the scope) defaults to random thing that's the same as the id\n   - name is the same as id when an id is specified\n   - name is equal to the name property specified on the field options object (and is different than the id)\n2. Add name to the api-check for a field. Somewhere around here\n3. Add setFieldName logic to the FormlyFieldController. Somewhere around here potentially even change setFieldId to setFieldIdAndName... Do something like $scope.options.name = $scope.options.name || $scope.options.id at the end\n4. Update this line to use scope.name rather than scope.id.\nI'd recommend giving this a watch if you haven't already.\nIf nobody gets to this before I do, then that's fine...\n. Thanks to @benoror, this is now supported in 6.13.0. Thanks!\n. Looks like I've pushed a new version since you opened this. I'll remove it next chance I get :-)\n. Hmmm... Yeah, I suppose that internally we'll do something like this:\njavascript\nconst fieldTransform = $scope.options.fieldTransform || formlyConfig.extras.fieldTransform;\nif (fieldTransform) {\n  $scope.fields = fieldTransform($scope.fields);\n}\nThat way you could either copy them yourself or simply modify them to maintain references to the correct field.\nThe reason that I bring this up is that if formly-field actually makes a copy for you, then you may be pointing to the field that you create in your controller, but that ends up not being the field that formly actually uses, which could lead to unexpected behavior.\nBut I think that kind of an implementation in formly-form would be pretty flexible.\n. I have pushed some tests for this feature. I've actually already developed this feature and gotten all the tests passing locally, but I want to give someone the chance to make their first OSS contribution, so here are some instructions (if you have already contributed to open source, please let someone else take this one):\n- [x] Watch this video to learn what you need to do to get things setup\n- [x] Go to this line and change describe.skip to describe.only\n- [x] Run $ npm test\n- [x] Notice that all the tests are failing\n- [x] Update formlyApiCheck.js to allow the formly-form options to have a fieldTransform that's a function (somewhere around here)\n- [x] Add a function call right after this one in formly-form.js called setupFields and declare it below (probably around setupOptions) where you'll put your logic for initializing the fields (which means you could probably move this to that new function).\n- [x] Implement setupFields to make the tests pass.\n- [x] Once they're passing, change the describe.only to describe so all the tests run.\n- [x] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #343 (notice it runs all the tests... twice)\n- [x] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR, get merged, celebrate \ud83c\udf89\n.

Ah, good point @koenweyn. angular-formly does use console.warn in several places when you're using its API incorrectly as well.

Here's the API I envision...\nI install your library as a dependency. We'll call it better-npm-run for now...

Thanks!\n. @ckniffen, not sure I understand what you mean. The $parsers and $formatters apis are available in angular 1.2\n. Yes, it would be similar to formly-custom-validation except it would do something like: ctrl.$parsers = ctrl.$parsers.concat(options.parsers) or ctrl.$parsers = options.parsers.concat(ctrl.$parsers) depending on which order we decide to apply the new parsers.\n\nThen there's the decision on how to merge them...\n. @benoror, yes, it will, that's what I'm planning on doing. But we need to consider defaultOptions and overriding as well as considering existing $parsers and $formatters.\n. That's mostly what I want feedback on (noted in the numbered list above)\n. Sounds good.\nFor your \"as an object\" suggestion, I considered that as well. The problem is then you have to figure out how to determine which to push on the pipeline first. So I think that an id would probably be better. But can anyone think of a use case where this would be needed? I think I'll leave it out until someone mentions they need it...\n. Here's my plan for implementation:\nWhen merging parsers, they will be concatenated together. Options can be merged in four scenarios. This is the order the parsers will be concatenated (meaning the parsers will run from the top of this list to the bottom):\n1. Extended type\n2. Type\n3. optionsTypes (in order specified)\n4. parsers specified on the field\nFor example:\n``` javascript\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'parent1',\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [parent1Parser1, parent1Parser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'parent2',\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [parent2Parser1, parent2Parser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'child',\n  extends: 'parent1', // <-- note this!\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [childParser1, childParser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'optionType1',\n  extends: 'parent2', // <-- note this!\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [optionType1Parser1, optionType1Parser2]\n  }\n});\nformlyConfig.setType({\n  name: 'optionType2',\n  defaultOptions: {\n    parsers: [optionType2Parser1, optionType2Parser2]\n  }\n});\n// parser definitions excluded for brevity...\n// elsewhere... in some controller\nvar vm = this;\nvm.fields = [\n  {\n    type: 'child',\n    optionsTypes: ['optionType1', 'optionType2'],\n    parsers: [fieldParser1, fieldParser2]\n  }\n];\n```\nThe resulting merged array for this field's parser would appear as:\njavascript\n[\n  parent1Parser1, parent1Parser2,\n  childParser1, childParser2,\n  parent2Parser1, parent2Parser2,\n  optionType1Parser1, optionType1Parser2,\n  optionType2Parser1, optionType2Parser2,\n  fieldParser1, fieldParser2\n]\nFormatters will be the exact same.\nCould someone sanity check me on this one? It's a little confusing, I don't use parsers/formatters very often, so someone with more experience may be able to help me to determine the most logical solution. I think this is correct though. Just want to make sure that I'm covering my bases!\nP.S. Doing something like this with that many parsers would be utter insanity... Just had that thought :-) But this is a very contrived example\n. Note, in the case of formatters, they will be executed in reverse order as indicated by the docs. But I believe this is also desirable behavior...\n. Just got the above example to pass as a test for parsers. I'm going to push this up into master. I would really appreciate if interested parties try it out and ensure that it works as you expect. I'll be working on formatters next. After I get some feedback (and fix anything) then I'll release a beta so more people can try it out. I'm concerned about getting this feature right, so please help by trying it out.\n. Sorry, jumped the gun. I broke several other tests with my implementation. I'll comment when I've actually pushed the parsers stuff.\n. Alright, it's working great! I've decided to make all parsers evaluate as formlyExpressions which means they can be expressed as strings and they also have access to the field's scope (and therefore the field's options). Also, I've actually just released a beta version that has parsers support. Again, please test it out and make sure I haven't missed anything important. I'll add formatters once I hear that parsers is working out for people (should reuse much of the same code).\nnpm install angular-formly@6.21.0-beta.0\n. Alrighty, formatters support is in the next beta version. Please provide feedback:\nnpm install angular-formly@6.21.0-beta.1\n. Has anyone had a chance to validate that this works as you'd expect? I don't really have a use case for this in my app, so it's hard for me to know whether it makes sense as implemented.\n. It's out of beta :-) Thanks for the feedback!\n. Thanks for trying it out @koenweyn! I'm sure that we could make it work without trouble. It would amount to adding that logic you have to this function. This seems like a good opportunity for a first-timers-only issue. Do you think that you could file a bug separately and I'll prepare the issue for a first timer? (you could even prepare it if you would like).\n. Precisely :-) You can see the others\n. @synthecypher, I created an example for the website. It will be live soon. If you can't wait 3 more minutes for it to deploy, here it is :-)\n. You add them as part of the defaultOptions :-)\n. The best way to get help is to follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for commenting @a-laughlin. I actually like that idea a lot. Unless someone comes along with a good rebuttal, I think this is what I'll do.\nThis can be implemented as a \"smooth\" breaking change, as in, I'll add the asyncValidators property, and add a console warning to any non asyncValidators validator that returns a promise that this api is being deprecated and they must either return true or false, or they must use the new asyncValidators api.\nWould love more input (even if it's a :+1:). I think this is where I'm going.\n. Released as 6.18.0. Not a breaking change. Simply allows you to add asyncValidators explicitly. Also, you can specify formlyConfig.extras.explicitAsync which will prevent any of your validators from being placed onto the $asyncValidators pipeline.\n. Just updated the example\n. This is definitely possible, but it's not the default behavior in angular and angular-formly doesn't (isn't going to) support this in the core because it's pretty use-case specific. You could use an onChange in the templateOptions of your checkbox that removes the values you wish. That would likely be a good solution I think.\n\n<canned-message>\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Ask on Chat\nP.S. sorry for the canned message, this just happens a lot :smile: \n</canned message>\n. Good question. I believe the docs are unclear. If the type you have specified has wrappers assigned to it, then the only way to get rid of them is to use null which will remove all wrappers (as you have pointed out). There is not currently a way in angular-formly to completely override wrappers. So you'll have to create another type that has the wrappers you want. You can use formlyConfig.getType to copy properties from an existing type to a new, similar type that you create.\n\nI'm thinking that as a breaking change for the next version, I'll make it so that if wrapper are specified on the field, then the type's wrappers will not apply. That seems to me to make the most sense. (while I'm at it, I'll change the name from wrapper to wrappers because most of the time it is specified as an array anyway.\n. Would love feedback from anyone on this breaking change for the next version:\n1. Any problem changing the term wrapper to wrappers as it's specified as an array most of the time?\n2. Any problem removing the default wrapper behavior? Basically, if you specify the name 'default' then it will wrap all types. This is a little bit too magical I think. And I believe it's undocumented.\n3. Any problem changing behavior so that if you specify a wrappers array on a field then rather than joining with the wrappers from the type, it entirely overrides them?\n4. I've recently thought that <formly-transclude></formly-transclude> is quite long. Any suggestions on whether it should be something else/shorter?\n5. Anything else anyone would like to see change in wrappers?\n. Good comments @redhead. I'll keep the formly-transclude then\n@pdemilly, I love the idea of it being an object with keys. The problem with that is how to define order. Once you do that you get into an issue with priority... We've talked about this on #368. What we could do though is give a wrapper an ID and you could optionally specify a wrapper as an object with a name and an id. Something like:\njavascript\nwrappers: ['foo', {name: 'bar', id: 'barWrapper'}]\nThough I still think that this is less simple than just overriding the type's properties altogether. Thoughts?\n. Oh, I like that a lot. And that could be non-breaking as well... Problem is that it's not quite as obvious, so I think I'll still have a breaking change to make it override wrappers when specified, but I think optionally giving it a function opens a lot of flexibility.\n. Definitely not going to get into priority. I would hate to see the day where I see: priority: Infinity and priority: Infinity + 1 :-(\nWe need this to be simpler, not more complex.\n. Can you give more info? Give us more of the error message. What version of angular-formly and angular are you using?\n. I'm not sure what's going on. But the problem is that the formly.js script is not getting added to your resulting minified script file.\n. > <canned-message>\n\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Doing this saves big time on watchers (two watchers per form rather than two per field). You'll need to either bind the tabs model's to formState (probably easier) or you'll have to add a $watch to your controller and invoke the runExpressions function on the fields yourself.

Not only that, but the context in which the string version is evaluated doesn't have access to $scope.\n. Actually, the way angular works is it only runs validation on the NgModelController that actually had a changed value. This was a decision that comes with downsides for sure. The one downside is that you have to tell angular to re-validate the fields yourself. You have a handle on the NgModelController via the options.formControl property (or the shortcut of fc if you have the field's scope). Here's an example that may help you. It uses an expressionProperty to accomplish this.\n<canned-message>\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Ah, in that case, place a templateOptions.onChange = function($viewValue, $modelValue, scope) { ... } and do the logic in there instead. (You have access to the other field via the scope.fields property)\n. Note, this wouldn't be without a migration path. Because of the fieldTransform functionality, I could provide a workable fieldTransform (with instructions/an example on how to use it) that you could copy to your project and slowly migrate the forms in your project over time. It wouldn't be perfect, but I think it would work well. So don't let that part scare you. I'm more concerned about the idea. Do you think this would make angular-formly more approachable/simple/maintainable/etc.?\n. Hopefully most templates will require very few changes. The idea of most of these attributes is that they would be dynamically added to the ng-model element(s) in the template so the templates don't have to concern themselves with them. But I know at least the bootstrap templates' label wrapper uses required and would require updating. But that would be trivial and I would likely make a shortcut for this new property (like the to shortcut for options.templateOptions, we'd probably have ma for options.ngModelAttrs or something like that).\n. Not quite, but from a template author's perspective, you should hopefully have just a few places to update things. Unfortunately, from a user's perspective, many field properties that used to live in templateOptions would go to ngModelAttrs instead. As I said, I'd make a demonstration of a  fieldTransform that would allow you to make that transition over time, but eventually you'd want to rewrite all of your field configuration objects to resemble the new format.\n. I agree @redhead, I don't like the name either (especially since it's already in use and it seems long and ugly to me too). I'd love suggestions on a better one... Perhaps we can consider something that would make sense in both an angular 1 and angular 2 context...\n. Hmmm... I'll have to think on that a little more. I'm trying to think what would be most obvious for a new comer... ngModelAttrs is the best name I can think of for someone new to angular-formly but used to angular forms...\n. @dwolt, your perspective as a user is exactly what I'm trying to get, so thanks for sharing!\n\nOriginally, angular-formly didn't have any kind of structure for its options. If you wanted to create a new template, you would just add your own property to the field config object and life was good. Until the angular-formly core library comes around and decides to use a property of the same name for some other purpose and now you're stuck.\nFor example, let's imagine that you decide you want to make a special input that allows you to react when when you type into the input. You would probably add an onKeyup property to the field config and use that:\njavascript\n{\n  type: 'datepicker',\n  onKeyup: function(event) {\n    if (event.which === 32) {\n      console.log('space typed!!');\n    }\n  }\n}\nThen angular-formly comes along and decides to add this to all fields, but makes the function arguments different. Instead of passing the event, it passes the $viewValue or something. Or perhaps angular-formly processes your field differently because that field exists. This would prevent you from upgrading until you refactored all of your fields.\nHopefully that makes sense and builds a case for the separation as well as the use of api-check in this project. I force you to place your own stuff in either data or templateOptions and I let you have full reign over those objects. Except in the case of templateOptions, there are properties that angular-formly uses to do some of its magic. Which sort of reintroduces the original issue. Which is why I'm suggesting this change would be worth the migration.\nDoes that make sense? Any holes in my logic? Is it not worth it?\nAsside from that, the templateOptions stuff is a little magical and is something that you must learn. It's not really intuitive. Something like ngModelAttrs makes a lot of sense. You just think to yourself: \"What would I normally put alongside the ng-model element, there's probably a property for that.\"\n. @rmulder, I cannot express how sorry I am that the change to hideExpression didn't work for you. I remember you mentioning having difficulties with it, but I didn't realize how wide sweeping a change that was for you. The reason it didn't result in a breaking change was the old way still works just as it did before, so you can stick with that. And I could add something that allows you to disable the warning formly now gives if you try to use hide in an expressionProperty if you want. I'm just so so sorry that this  has caused you grief :-(\nI appreciate you voicing your opinion and I will make sure that this upgrade is as painless as possible. I'm confident that a fieldTransform could quite easily make this work out of the box (you'd just copy/paste the field transform and it should work for you).\nOne thing I wish to clarify is that this library is not \"under development.\" This library works really really well and I could stop working on it and people would benefit from it for as long as angular 1.x is around. It is, however, being developed and improved. I just want to reiterate that angular-formly is no more \"under development\" as angular is. It's solid and it honors semver. I expect this isn't what you meant @rmulder, but I want to make it clear that angular-formly is a production-ready library :+1: :-)\n. Good thoughts everyone. Thanks for providing feedback (keep it coming). I'm going to think on this for a bit and I'll get back to you with what I decide on.\n. @ckniffen, you've convinced me with this line:\n\nThe reason being is that more implementation details now need to be known in order to know which object to place properties.\n\nI want to try really hard to not force people to know implementation details. For that reason, I'm closing this issue.\nBig thanks to everyone who dropped their opinion in here. Note, I do intend to implement #378 which should make it easier to add custom attributes to the ng-model element. Feel free to read up on that and drop an opinion on there. That will not be a breaking change :-)\n. Also, I intend to implement adding the extras property onto the field configuration object. This object would be apiChecked by formly (as opposed to the templateOptions and data properties) and would be used to configure stuff that's specific to angular-formly core (rather than a template library). (Though, having just written that, it sounds like implementation details, but I think this is one case that we can make an exception due to the fact that these are edge cases).\n. Fantastic. Thank you!\n. This has been released (and tested) in 6.16.1. Thanks for finding the bug!\n. And thanks even more for fixing it and explaining it so well :-)\n. Awesome. I think that I'm going to implement this one. I think it's a good idea and much simpler than the existing ngModelAttrs.\n. The existing ngModelAttrs is a highly complicated API because it's highly optimized. This would just make things more straightforward.\n. @sparty02, while your concern is valid, I think that the most straightforward name would be something like: ngModelElementAttributes, but that's way too wordy. If we abbreviate the stuff that makes sense, we can do: ngModelElAttrs and that's much better. I can't think of any other name that would be more strightforward.\n. This is indeed a bug. I'm on vacation, so I can't look at this now, but a\ntested PR would be welcome.\n- Kent C.

This has been discussed before and angular-formly has decided to not alter the model based on whether a field is hidden.

Seems like it could be an issue with your own settings.\n. @prokilogrammer, I'm sorry, but this is actually how it's supposed to work. The docs aren't very clear, but if you look above the docs for value, there's a callout that says:\nAdded Properties\nThe properties listed below are added to your field configuration.\n\nMeaning that you shouldn't override them, but they are actually added. It's purpose is to be used internally to get the current value as well as when you specify modelOptions as specified in the docs:\nUnder value\n\nUseful when using getterSetter: true in the modelOptions\n\nUnder modelOptions\n\nNote, if you use the getter/setter option, formly's templateManipulator will change the value of ng-model to options.value which is a getterSetter that formly adds to field options\n\nSo I wont be accepting #383. I'm sorry :-/\nNow, I think what you're wanting to do (based on your example) is use either parsers of formatters which is on the roadmap in #368.\n. Yeah, without pushing every property down another heading level, I can't do that unfortunately... I'll see if there's a sensible obvious way to do that. Really sorry you took the time to write a PR and everything. I hope it was at least a good learning experience!\n. Curious about what the use case for a custom getterSetter is...\n.

You'll find that it's easier to first try to accomplish something without angular-formly. Then take that solution and accomplish it with angular-formly.

I simply don't have time to triage issues myself. While doing this may be a little less helpful in the short-term, it does help people figure things out for themselves and they learn how angular-formly works so they have fewer questions in the future and they're able to use angular-formly more productively.\nAs a note to your specific example, you could pretty easily extend an existing type to add support for the cc-card attribute :-) I created an example and added it to the website: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/integrations/angular-credit-card\n. Note, there's a bug right now that's making this not work quite right, but hopefully that'll be resolved soon.\n. Could you give me a better example? I (and many others) are shipping projects that use field groups and uglify our code when we ship it. My guess is that your issues are not related to angular-formly, but maybe how you're using it (for example, you may be specifying a custom controller that's not properly annotated).\n. That sounds about right. So that solves your problem right? Please close this issue if so.\n. Closing this issue. The issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests.

Yes, I believe what you're suggesting is the correct fix to the bug. Thanks for spending the time digging into this. I think you have a good idea for the fix. Do you fancy creating some tests for the bug and fixing the issue? Would probably go somewhere in here. (Notice that even though the tests are run with angular 1.4, you can force formly-custom-validation to use parsers anyway with use-parsers).\n. No, that code lives in master so you shouldn't have any merge conflicts. And it was additive so I wouldn't expect any issues with it.\n. Sorry about that, but congrats on the upgrade! There are a lot of really cool features in 1.3 (here are some) :-)\nThanks for the code. I think I may just implement this as a bugfix. Unless you (or anyone watching) can think of a reason it shouldn't be...\n. Good point. A diagram would probably be helpful. I'll give it some thought.\n. I'm going to consider this one a breaking change. Even though it may be easy to think of it as a bugfix, it definitely changes behavior and so I'll include it in the 7.0.0 milestone. I'm hoping to give that milestone an entire day to work on it. I may develop this functionality as a formlyConfig.extras property which you can enable and then remove the original functionality when 7.0.0 hits...\n. I'm not 100% certain that this is correct... After looking at it, I think there's a problem. Particularly with this line:\njavascript\nctrl.$modelValue = viewValue;\nand this line:\njavascript\nreturn ctrl.$modelValue;\nI found that the later prevented other async validators from starting which I don't believe is the correct behavior, and the former doesn't take parsers into account. I'm going to go ahead and close this because you've moved on to Angular 1.3, nobody else has complained, and I'm dropping 1.2 support in the next major release (not the one I'm doing in a few minutes, but the one after that).\nFor anyone else, feel free to resurrect this if need be.\n.

Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is to follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nThe github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. The core of angular-formly has nothing to do with the templates/types that are used to create the form. For example, angular-formly itself knows nothing about an input element. This has been delegated to the end developer to tell formly about the different types that you'll be using in your application. To learn about how to do this, see the \"Custom Templates\" video here.\nThis, however is out of the scope of the angular-formly core library and therefore cannot be a feature request for this repository. You could however request an example for the website.\nGood luck! :+1: \n. I think that I'll start with a deprecation notice for this one. Then in 7.0.0, I'll rip it out altogether.\n. Love this. Would love some feedback from people on this one.\n. You might have to re-open this one... I can't seem to find it... \ud83d\ude1c #seewhatididthere?\n. This comment is no longer relevant.\n. Alright, I think there's enough support for this issue that I've added the intent to implement and up-for-grabs labels :+1: \n. This has been released in 6.22.0! Thanks for the suggestion @TheMcMurder :-)\n. @alxvallejo, agreed. Perhaps someone (you) would like to write a plugin to keep all that common code :-)\n. Hi @Astray-git, thanks for using angular-formly. This is actually not a bug, but a performance optimization that angular-formly makes for you. To indicate to angular-formly that you wish to change the property, you need to use expressionProperties. Here's a working example of your issue: https://jsbin.com/qijuwe/edit?html,js,output\nGood luck!\n. This may require a breaking change...\n. Just for context... runExpressions is a function that's added to all of your fields which is in charge of running all of your expressionProperties. You can invoke it yourself, but most of the time it's just invoked by the parent formlyForm (here).\nBecause expressionProperties require the $viewValue and the $modelValue, I remember having trouble with getting those values at the time I was developing it. Wrapping the function in a $timeout seemed to fix the problem. However, things have changed and it may not be necessary to do this anymore. I'm crossing my fingers.\nIf it is still necessary to execute expressionProperties on the \"next tick\" of the event loop, the next best thing I could do is replace $timeout with setTimeout. Right now, every one of your expressionProperties causes a $digest to fire because it's using $timeout. This is a major performance drag. However, if I switch to setTimeout then I fear that we may have a situation where things don't get updated as you would expect and you'd have to invoke $digest yourself (I don't want to force you to do this). This is why I would release this in a beta and ask that a lot of people please upgrade to try it out in your apps.\nFeedback is appreciated.\n. Oh! Yeah! Why didn't I think of that earlier. Thanks for the tip. That's probably exactly what I need.\n. Sorry, somehow this slipped through the cracks for me. I want to avoid doing too much different from the angular implementation of how to treat the model. Fewer surprises, more consistency. As a side, I actually disagree with you and I believe that the clearing of the model is appropriate.\nOn the subject of select onChange, I haven't seen what you're experiencing. Could you create an example and file a bug if you feel there is one?\n. Yeah, it didn't really work out well for me either. I'll release a bugfix version with the removed file.\n. The file has been removed in 6.21.1. Thanks for letting me know.\n. Hi @sharpmachine! Thanks for using angular-formly. The best way for you to get help is to go to http://help.angular-formly.com and follow the instructions there. The github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests. So I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. As before this one is for first-timers-only.

I'll hold your hand through this if you need me to. :-) Here are the steps to get a PR merged here.\n- [x] Watch this video to learn what you need to do to get things setup\n- [x] Go to this test and change describe.skip to describe.only\n- [x] Run $ npm test\n- [x] Notice that it's failing\n- [x] Go to this line. This is where formly decides which instance of apiCheck to use to issue the warning. We need to tell formly to default to the field's instance (the one that's passed in and is called apiCheckInstance), then the formlyConfig.extras.apiCheckInstance, then the formlyApiCheck instance. Right now it's missing the formlyConfig.extras.apiCheckInstance. I would just add it as another || between the first and second one on the same line.\n- [x] Update the eslint comment here to allow for a complexity of 9 (instead of 8) because you're adding another branch of complexity. Don't worry, it's covered, and I think that the code is fairly easy to understand. If you want, you could refactor it to make it even better.\n- [x] Once the test is passing, change the describe.only to describe so all the tests run.\n- [x] Make sure that all the tests pass\n- [x] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #343 (note it may take a second... it runs all the tests...)\n- [x] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR, get merged, celebrate \ud83c\udf89\nI'm happy to hold your hand through this if you need help. Catch me on gitter.\n. Thanks @bmacheski!\n. This has been released in angular-formly@6.23.0 :-)\n. Sorry this took so long for me to get back to you. Work's been crazy. So, I realized late that this would actually break anyone who's using the formly-field directly. Even though technically the formly-field directive is internal, I know that I'm using it and I'm sure others are as well, so I'd prefer not to break it.\nDo you think you'd have time to work in just one more piece to this PR? I'd like a test that's something like this pseudo code to pass:\njavascript\nit(`should add the model watcher when it's not the direct child of a formly-form`, function() {\n  const someExpressionProperty = sinon.spy();\n  compileAndDigest('<div formly-field class=\"formly-field\" options=\"field\" model=\"field.model\"></div>');\n  scope.field.model.foo = 'hello';\n  scope.$digest();\n  $timeout.flush();\n  expect(someExpressionProperty).to.have.been.calledOnce;\n});\nThat's not complete, but hopefully you get the idea. I would expect the implementation of it would simply check the parent element (probably in the link function because I'd prefer to avoid injecting $element into the controller) and if it's not a formly-form, then add the watch as it was before.\nSorry this has been such a long-lived PR. Thanks a ton for your work on it!\n. I could see an edge case where this could be nested inside a formly-form (as a field template) and that would be a problem. But that's definitely an edge case and I don't think we need to consider that. Thanks for working on this!\n. I'll release this tomorrow. I try to limit my coding on Sundays. Thanks!\n. Turns out this is only possible if you specify an ID for all the fields. Most people aren't doing this. If you are doing this, then I recommend that you specify track-by as an attribute.\n.

See you in chat!\n. Awesome! This is perfect. Thanks for working on it! Welcome to the wonderful world of open source :-)\n. Feedback is welcome. How did it go? Were my instructions helpful? How could I have improved on this?\n. Also, what's your twitter handle?\n. Hey @bmacheski, I'm writing a blogpost that references this PR, do you mind if I reference you in it? https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/78281ea47455\n. Linking this to #410\n. Hi @amangupta01 \ud83d\udc4b \nWelcome! I'm not maintaining this library anymore, however I do have this article that could help you find a library that you would be interested in contributing to. I also have a free video course that teaches how to contribute to a project once you've found one.\nGood luck!. Ah, well, if you read the article I linked, I give some tips on finding libraries that you could contribute code to :). Hi @GoNode5! Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. I'm sure that angular-formly can do this for you. The best way to get help is by following the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nI'm going to go ahead and close this issue because the github issues for this project are reserved for bug reports and feature requests. See you on chat!\n. Seems good to me. Thanks @benoror. I hope this helps @nomack84. I'm going to go ahead and close this issue because issues are reserved for feature requests and bugs. If you need help, follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. I think the issue you're seeing isn't an issue with formly, but with the part that displays the model. See here.\n. Did this resolve your issue? Please close if so.\n. Here's what I'd recommend: https://jsbin.com/wibado/edit?html,js,console,output\nWill that do it for you?\nEither way, this could be helpful. If you want to make a PR, we can take a look at the amount of complexity it adds to angular-formly. I'm fairly confident I'd accept a PR for this though. Thanks!\n. Here's a good workaround: https://jsbin.com/wibado/edit?html,js,console,output\n. :+1: \n. This actually would probably be a good first-timers-only issue. Maybe I'll work on adding some tests sometime. Until then, feel free to submit a PR if you want. Should be pretty simple.\n. Hi @marcoriesco, thanks for using angular-formly. I'm not certain that I understand the problem you're having. If you could be a little more clear that would be helpful. Some reproduction steps in the jsbin you created would be helpful.\nEither way, the github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. Need to add skipNgModelAttrsManipulator here\n. Awesome. Took me a while to figure out what on earth you were doing with the tests. But I think they're good. :+1: Just add that comment and I'll merge this and release it\n. Released as 6.23.2. Thanks a ton @koenweyn :-)\n\nOur resident IE8 support expert @koenweyn caught it and PRed a fix.\n\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#6232\n. Just found out that these tests are actually failing. For some reason, the SnapCI build is still passing. Not sure what's going on here. If you have any idea, would love help there.\n. Fixed it. Was a simple logic issue. You'll see my commit soon. Thanks.\n. Yeah, it's odd that it didn't... I should probably look into that as well...\n. I'm thinking that @benoror's betterNpmScripts isn't propagating failures for some weird reason... I think I need to come up with an alternative solution or something... Ah well...\n. Thanks for setting this up @koenweyn!\nHere's another first-timers-only issue! I will only accept a PR from someone who's never contributed to an open source project before!\nI'll hold your hand through this so you can get your first PR into a real open source project! Your goal is to make this test pass. Here are some steps:\n- [ ] Watch this video to learn what you need to do to get things setup\n- [ ] Go to this test and change it.skip to it.only\n- [ ] Run $ npm test\n- [ ] Notice that it's failing\n- [ ] Go to this function. This is where angular-formly applies the formatters from the field options to the $formatters of the NgModelController. Look at the code sample that @koenweyn suggests in the comment above. You'll do something similar. You'll get ctrl from scope.fc.\n- [ ] Once the test is passing, change the it.only to it so all the tests run.\n- [ ] Make sure that all the tests pass\n- [ ] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #423 (this issue) in your commit message (note it may take a second... it runs all the tests...)\n- [ ] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR with the description mentioning issue #423 (this issue), get merged, celebrate \ud83c\udf89\nCatch me on gitter if you need help!\n. Yeah, that's totally fine. There's been plenty of time for a first timer to grab this if they wanted to. There will other opportunities.\n. Ah! Yes, thank you @redhead, this is indeed implemented.\n. Thanks a ton for doing this @koenweyn! This is super cool! If you could just address the one thing that I mentioned then I think we're good.\n. Thanks a ton!\n. This is definitely possible and many people do it. Here's an example: http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/json-powered\nI'm going to go ahead and close this issue. The github issues are reserved for feature requests and bug reports. If you need help, follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for looking into this. My first impression is that this would add quite a bit of complexity to the codebase. That's fine, but I want to make sure that the complexity is worth it. Do you think you could produce an example that demonstrates the perf bottleneck?\nMaybe I'm mistaken and this wont actually make things more complex...\n. I'm still not 100% sure this is good from a simplicity standpoint. Feel free to create a PR. That might help me visualize exactly what the API and the code changes involved would look like. But just know that I'm not certain whether I'd accept it.\nI really appreciate your contributions! Thank you for your work!\n. I think that would be better. The thing I don't like about what you were originally suggesting is that we're creating our own magic DSL by having '.something' have special meaning. I would prefer it if there were a little less angular-formly-specific magic going on, and it was easier to understand what's happening. By doing what you've just suggested, I think that would be much better.\n. Here's a solution using formState: https://jsbin.com/gokonaq/edit?js,output\n. Hi @setakhero, thanks for using angular-formly! The problem is that you need to define a datepicker type yourself. I recommend that you watch the videos here: http://learn.angular-formly.com to familiarize yourself with how angular-formly works.\nThe issues on this github repo are reserved for bug reports and feature requests. If you need help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com. Good luck! I'm going to close this issue. See you in the chat! Thanks again.\n. Note, this doesn't handle the multiple ng-model case. If you want to implement that, that would be great.\n. Looks like another case where angular-formly abstracts away complexity/broken parts from angular's built-in forms. Thanks!\n. Hi @SupriyaVenkatesh. Your question is related to how to work with ui date-picker, not angular-formly. I recommend you direct your question to them. Also, as I believe you are aware, the github issues are reserved for bug reports and feature requests. If you need help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for letting me know! @TheMcMurder's fix is in release 6.23.5\n. Turns out that there's still an issue with setting the form to $dirty. @TheMcMurder is working on a fix now.\n. Ah, now I see. Do we need to consider the common case for formState as well? Someone could say the model is formState.foo or something and we're already watching formState. We could do that in a separate PR or we could add that to this one. Either way, I like this and I think it enhances formly while keeping the external API unchanged. \ud83d\udc4d\n. @redhead, thanks so much for working on this. I really appreciate you taking the time to invest in the project \ud83c\udf1f gold star for you!\n. This is super awesome! The one thing left I just realized is the case for model['some-crazy-key'], but I think we can address that later. Thanks for working on this @redhead. I'll get it in and released now!\n. Released as 6.23.7\n. Will do. Thanks!\n. Hi @irhabi. Please see this example. Also, from README:\n\nPlease don't file an issue unless you feel like you've found a bug or have a feature request. Instead, go to help.angular-formly.com and follow the instructions.\n\nSo I'm going to close this issue.\n. This appears to work just fine for me: http://jsbin.com/fowufo/edit?html,js,output\n. I'm not certain I understand what you mean, but if you want to completely workaround the autocomplete by Chrome, take a look at the extras for formlyConfig. Specifically the removeChromeAutoComplete property.\nIf that's not sufficient, could you please describe exactly what the problem is? Thanks.\n. Yeah, I don't think there's really anything that angular or angular-formly could do for you. If you have any specific ideas or fixes, I'm open to hearing them, but I'm going to go ahead and close this one as out of scope. Good luck!\n. Instead of putting templateOptions.onChange in expressionProperties, put onChange in templateOptions. It's similar to this example\nNote, from the README:\n\nPlease don't file an issue unless you feel like you've found a bug or have a feature request. Instead, go to help.angular-formly.com and follow the instructions.\n\nSo I'm going to go ahead and close this. Thanks.\n. Yes, look into ngModelOptions.

Hmmm... When in angular 1.2, angular-formly uses the$parsersapi to do validation (standard way to do validation in 1.2). I think this is happening because angular 1.2 doesn't re-run the parsers when the model is changed programmatically (as it is in your example). So you're going to have to figure out a way to trigger the parsers to re-run whenever you change the model programmatically. You might consider looking into thewatchers` property to do this.\nLet me know if you think there's something that we can do in angular-formly core to make this easier for you and we can talk about it. Otherwise I'm going to close this as a wont-fix. Good luck!\n. Hmmm... If you can come up with a consistent way to update the validity properly, then perhaps I can find a good way to integrate that solution into formly core (or I'd happily accept a PR).\n. Fantastic! Thanks for writing this up! I hope you don't mind iterating on this a little bit. I have a comment or two. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Thank you so much for working on this :+1: This is definitely needed!\n. Nope! It's perfect! Thanks!\n. Also, this: http://beletsky.net/2015/04/npm-for-everything.html\n. @ckniffen, how does the work-around not work for you?\n. I'm wanting to automate releases using semantic-release. Currently, semantic-release doesn't push the built changes to the git repo (https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/75). I bet I could finagle something to get it to work, but it's just extra complexity and time spent that I'd like to avoid if I can.\nThe process of a release before adding semantic-release was to do this basically:\n1. Make and commit the changes\n2. Manually update the changelog (which I've made mistakes on several times)\n3. Decide whether this is a breaking change, new feature, or a bugfix and bump the version accordingly\n4. Run the build, commit changes, tag the commit with the version, push to github, npm publish\nLuckily, I was able to make the third item be a single command, but what semantic-release gives me is it removes the last three steps and does all of those automatically. This saves me time and reduces human error.\nThat's why I want to use semantic-release. I want to drop bower because semantic-release doesn't work well with bower currently and I also would prefer if we all (as a frontend community) just use npm instead.\n. I should mention, I'm just testing the waters. I was at a 30% likelihood of actually going through with this when I filed the feedback issue.\n. This doesn't have to happen! I got it working :-)\n. I'm sorry I've been so silent on this. I haven't had a chance to give it a good look. Sorry! :-/ I'll try to give it a closer look soon!\n. Haha, and I have a day job :P thanks for understanding :-)\n. Finally getting a chance to look into this. And I don't think I'm seeing the problem that you are... Do you mind trimming the example down a little bit and giving step-by-step reproduction instructions?\n. ping?\n. I realized what the problem was when I saw #485. The solution is the same: http://plnkr.co/edit/0roe4DzhhkANhOdJxhoX?p=preview\n. I'm going to close this. Let me know if you need more help\n. Fantastic! Sorry it took so long for me to respond.\n. This is definitely a bug. I may make this a first-timers-only issue. If someone else would like to write skipped tests to reproduce this issue, that would be awesome :-)\n. Hi @dannycallaghan! Thanks for doing this!\nIgnore the snap build. I just deleted it. We're now building with Travis. I need to add a check on travis that your commit message is correct. Now that we're automating our releases with semantic-release, we need to make sure that the commit messages are correct.

Thanks for this. Can't merge now, but will look more closely later. The problem with object is order isn't consistent/garunteed... Though I like the idea, I think we'll wait for someone to have aause case before we implement something like that.\nThanks again! I'll look at this later. In the mean time, could I ask for your feedback on ease of contributing?\n. Odd... Travis says that the build passed, but if I look at the output, it shows that two tests failed...\n.

The github issues are reserved for Bug Reports and Feature Requests. If you have a question in the future, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com thanks!\n. I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. You should be able to do this already... http://angular-formly.com/#/example/advanced/custom-ids-and-names\n. Ah, I misunderstood your question. My apologies. That's exactly what I do as well. Thanks for your patience.\n. Note, that's not 100% what I do because I have situations where there are two of the same form for two different models in the same page at the same time. So that implementation would result in duplicate ids. So, instead, I simply use the model id as part of the field id.\n. Here's what mine looks like:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction azGetFieldId(options, model, scope) {\n  if (options.id) {\n    return options.id;\n  }\n  const index = getIndexOfIdInFields(options, scope);\n  return ['az-formly', getModelIdentifier(model), options.key, index].join('_');\n}\nfunction getModelIdentifier(model) {\n  let identifier = 'no-id';\n  if (model) {\n    const objectType = (model.constructor && model.constructor.name) || 'Object';\n    identifier = ${objectType}_${model.id || 'no-id'};\n  }\n  return identifier;\n}\n// sometimes you have two fields that use the same key. This ensures they don't have the same ID\nfunction getIndexOfIdInFields(options, scope) {\n  const fieldsWithTheSameKey = .filter(scope.fields, field => field.key === options.key);\n  return .indexOf(fieldsWithTheSameKey, options);\n}\n```\nResults in something like:\naz-formly_${objectType}_${id}_${propertyName}_${index}\nExamples:\naz-formly_User_123453523_username_0  // existing User\naz-formly_User_no-id_username_0      // new User\naz-formly_Object_no-id_someProp_0    // new Object\n. Looks awesome. Thanks a ton!\n. Man! I love this semantic-release thing. I don't even need to pull this. This fix will be released in a few minutes automagically :+1: \n. This is the problem... https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/11023\nPerhaps there's something we can do on the angular-formly side to make this easier (particularly for versions of angular where this PR wont make it). What do you think @ckniffen?\n. I feel like I've done that before and it worked out alright. We'd probably\nneed to add a watcher for the parent form's submitted state to call that.\nUnfortunately, there's no way to detect whether this watcher is necessary\n(most of the time it won't be), so we'd want it to be opt-in... The more I\nthink about it, the more I think it should probably be a plugin...\n- Kent C.

Woah, 45-50 seconds is outrageous. Please make sure that you're following the tips (disable api-check when deploying to production). This will speed things up considerably. How many fields do you have?\n. This is a bug. Thanks for pointing it out. The code that needs to be fixed is here. Basically, we should be using the $parse service to set the value instead. This could be a pretty good first-timer-only issue. Are you up to setting up the tests like @koenweyn did for #423?

Go ahead and pull the latest changes. I apologize for that. Looking forward to your implementation (I've already done it so I know it's possible now!).\n\nGood luck!\n. That's coming from commitizen. Unfortunately if there's a failure, it's not printing out the logs (cc @jimthedev). To see what the problem could be, run npm run code-checks && npm run test && npm run check-coverage. If you don't see any problems, then you'll have to craft your commit message by hand (following the conventions) and use git commit --no-verify. Let me know.\n. This was fixed by @dfromero. Thank you so much! The new version is being built and automatically released now and should be available soon. Thanks again @dfromero on your first ever PR :-)\n. And that @BarryThePenguin for helping get this set up.\n. You might consider creating a custom directive that wraps this one and uses ng-model. The problem is, without ng-model, then formControl wouldn't really make sense. It would technically not be a formControl. One thing you might try is to simply add an ng-model on it and see what happens... Either way, this particular directive is doing it wrong. They should use ng-model.

Good luck!\n. Looks like ui-select isn't ready for angular 1.4.x yet. I've downgraded that example's angular to 1.3.19 and it's working great. Thanks for letting me know!\n. 140-500 fields is not large-ish. That's plain gigantic. I don't know what kind of user experience you're looking for, but I don't think that formly (or angular for that matter) can help you with the performance in that scenario. Out of curiosity, what version of angular and angular-formly are you using?\n. The problem is that you need all of those event listeners and watchers for your form to work properly.\nI would recommend:\n1. Upgrading to the latest angular-formly (there have been some significant performance optimizations made recently)\n2. Upgrading to the latest version of angular (though this can be more difficult if other dependencies you have aren't ready for it).\n3. Make sure you disable api-check in production as described in the tips\n4. Try showing only pieces of the form at a time, hide the rest of it behind an ng-if which will cause the form to not render until it's shown.\nI hope these tips help!\n. Good luck! Sorry the tech doesn't quite do what you were looking for in the first place :-/\n. Thanks @msc654! That is correct. That would be the proper way to do this. Because github issues on this project are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, I'm going to go ahead and close this one.

I am changing jobs and wont be using angular-formly (or Angular) in my new position. I am therefore not going to be very effective maintaining angular-formly (read: Open Source Stamina).\nSo I need someone to spearhead development and maintenance of the angular-formly project. Preferably someone who's using it on a regular basis at work. Maintaining this library should be relatively simple because it's so well tested and processes are so automated.\nCould someone please step up to the plate on spearheading this project?\n. @vijquick awesome!

I can't promise that I'll be available all day, but should be able to help most of the day.\nI'll get a few issues set up. At a high level, here are some things that I'd like:\n- Investigate an Angular 2 version (for the more ambitious of contributors)\n- Increase Test Coverage (both in the main repo and in the bootstrap templates)\n- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize for them <-- this one's really needed (and also for the more ambitious contributors)\n- Resolve existing issues\n- Record screencasts of features, write blogposts/tutorials, improve documentation, etc.\n- Write plugins for common use-cases (see below)\n  - ng-messages integration\n  - Repeating sections\n  - Angular Material\n  - JSON Schema support\n  - Additional types for bootstrap that integrates with angular-ui-bootstrap\n  - Other ideas here\nIf you're interested in writing a plugin, please see this spreadsheet to look at some of the ideas and sign up for what you're interested in working on.\nI've recorded a screencast explaining some of these things a bit if you like to watch, check it out here.\nAlso, if you're just getting started contributing to angular-formly, I just recorded a new screencast with instructions on how to contribute. Here it is. Note, I'm afraid I'm a bit long-winded in that one. You might also benefit from the original (albeit a tad out-dated).\nAs always, please check the project's CONTRIBUTING.md and make sure to follow the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\nThanks for your help!!!\n. Nothing official. Just stuff in the examples page.\n. Hey, I had three family things come up for this weekend so I'm going to have to push this back two weeks. Is it alright if we move it to the 24th?\n. Thanks for letting me know! I've fixed it.\n. I know what the problem is. When the form is rendered, angular-formly will look through the given fields and set up $watchers with them. But angular-formly doesn't watch your fields after that point. So when you change them or anything, that initialization step doesn't run for those new fields.\nOne solution to this is to prevent the form from being rendered until the fields are available, like so: http://jsbin.com/fudufaj/edit?html,js,console,output\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this. If you need more help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\nIf this doesn't actually solve the problem, let me know. Thanks!\n. @benoror, could you fix that example?\n. I agree. Adding wrappers support to fieldGroup would be a neat feature. I'll add that as a label and add up-for-grabs to invite people to contribute :-)\n. Answered here. The GitHub issues in this project are reserved for reporting bugs and feature requests. In the future, please follow the instructions here to get help: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. You're good. You thought it was a feature request. No harm done :-) Good luck!\n. Awe, you're making me :blush: Thanks!\n. Hmmm... Yeah, if it's only happening locally I'm afraid there's not much I can do to help you :-(\n. Neat! Almost perfect. This just needs to be added to dependencies rather than devDependencies :-)\n. Also, I think there's something wrong with the build. Don't worry about it. I'll give  it a look\n. Be sure to comment when you've finished that. I wont be notified when you push changes.\n. Ah... Hmmm... You know what... I think I'd be alright with that if we could replace some of the other util methods of formly with lodash ones...\n. Hmmm... Yeah, I'm going to say that it's not worth it :-( Thanks anyway!\n. Could you please reproduce this issue here? http://issue.angular-formly.com/\n. Try this instead: http://jsbin.com/bogewe/edit?html,js,output\nBecause this is more of a question than a bug or a feature request, I'm going to close the issue. Please take this to the chat or stack overflow if you have further questions. Good luck!\n. Yeah, you definitely want to avoid anything that has to do with $broadcast :-)\n. I'm not sure I understand the problems with the current implementation. What do you mean by:\n\ninstead of much much later where we are forced to use setViewValue and setPristine and other workarounds so the formatters work?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean...\n. Oh, I think I see what you're saying. So by adding the parsers and formatters after the ng-model has been initialized, they don't run and we have to manually run them. So what you're suggesting is we have another directive and add them to the ngModelController as you would normally. We do this same thing with validators with the formly-custom-validation directive. We could do something similar with a formly-parsers-and-formatters directive... I think that would make the most sense and clean up some code too...\n. Yes, this is a bug. Feel free to makeapullrequest.com\n. You got it :-) https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#watch-the-videos\n. This isn't an angular-formly issue, it's actually an angular issue. The problem is that without the name attribute, there's absolutely no way for me to get access to the ng-model controller. One thing you might consider is creating a directive which requires the ngModel controller and then attaches it to scope.options.\nGive me a second and I think I could give you a quick example.\n. Here you go! http://jsbin.com/mebiju/edit?html,js,output\nBecause this isn't something that we'll be implementing in the core of angular-formly, I'll close this issue. However, if you like to make a plugin for formly, that'd be way cool!\n. Awesome!

Occasionally I'll reserve issues for first timers only would you like me to reserve this one for you and help you know what to do?\n. Awesome! I love the initiative! I'll get a test written for you as soon as possible (probably tomorrow hopefully)\n. Hey @chrisheninger! Have at it! Here are the tests.\nThis line and this line need to take an array of scope.fcs into account. I recommend you utilize the arrayify method (which you have access to in the scope of that function) which will take an argument and convert it to an array if it's not already one. Then call something like this on it: .some(f => f.$invalid); (or $touched for the other case).\nOne thing I just realized my test case doesn't cover is this line and this line. If you want to take a whack at writing tests for those scenarios too that'd be cool, otherwise let me know and I'll write up tests for those next time I get a chance. Good luck!!!\n. I've added a few more tests, but it still doesn't cover everything. I'll be honest, this one's a bit more complex. Don't feel bad if you have a hard time with the implementation.\n. Let's hold on the PR  now and get this all done in one. I'll give your commits a closer look tomorrow. I'm glad this is a learning experience for you! That's the point :-)\n. Just looked at your implementation. Do fast, so good :+1:\n. Sorry, autocorrect... I'm meant \"So far, so good\"\n. The tests don't cover everything that needs to be covered. I'll try to get the remaining test or two written. But basically anything in that function that references scope.fc needs to handle situations where scope.fc is an array.\n. Looks pretty solid. I'll need to get to a computer to work out helping with that last test. Thank you very much!\n. @bjspencer, looking at your solution I think that it's better than what I was planning on. So you'll want to change the test that you have skipped. Instead of\njavascript\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.calledWith(sinon.match.array, sinon.match.array)\nDo:\njavascript\nexpect(spy).to.have.been.calledTwice // once for each form control.\nThat should do it :-) Then make a PR and I'll merge it :D\n. @bjspencer's PR #553 just got merged. A new release will be pushed out automatically in a few moments :+1: \n. Please try it out and report back if it's not behaving as you expect. Until then, I'm closing this. Thanks @bjspencer and @chrisheninger!\n. Have you tried providing a function to errorExistsAndShouldBeVisibleExpression rather than simply a string? :-)\n. I think that really depends on your use case. For example, what do you want to have it do when two of the fields have required in their $error? Show two? Show one? Either way, I think you might be able to have a function you call to get the $error object rather than simply referencing it there... Just really depends on your specific use case I think.\n. We could probably cache this. Where did you see that it can take upwards of a couple of seconds?\n. Wow, this is great. Thank you!\n. Thanks for your help and kind words @dannycallaghan :-)\nNote, if all you want to do is override the template and add a controller you could define a new type that extends the input type, like so:\n``` javascript\nformlyConfigProvider.setType({\n    extends: 'input',\n    name: 'myInput',\n    template: require('YOUR_INPUT_TEMPLATE.html'),\n    // don't need a wrapper because it will inherit that from the input type \n    controller: ['$scope', function ($scope) {\n        if ($scope.to.type && $scope.to.type === 'date') {\n            /* \n            Do your stuff here, something like:\n        var currentModelVal = $scope.model[$scope.options.key];\n        if (typeof (currentModelVal) === 'string'){\n            $scope.model[$scope.options.key] = new Date(currentModelVal);\n        }\n        */\n    }\n}]\n\n});\n```\n.

Here's the original reproduction steps @isaac-l gave the other day\n\nIs there a known issue with http://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/matching-two-fields ? As far as I can tell, it doesn't work as expected\nFor example:\n1. Set email to a@b.c\n2. Set confirm to a@b.cd (Causes validation error as expected)\n3. Set email to a@b.cd (Should be valid, but still shows a validation error)\nLikewise, setting valid values then changing Email doesn't cause validation to fail\n. Try this. Add the validateOnModelChange extra to both fields. Then add the allowInvalid ng-model-option to both as well.\n\nThe issue is that when the value is invalid, the model value will be undefined, so by doing allowInvalid it will update the model value even when it's invalid. This means that your validator will be able to know what the value of the other field is.\n. Feedback:\n1. Looks good\n2. Don't use _angularFix2['default'] because that's the transpiled code, just use angular and babel will take care of the rest\nFeel free to open a PR.\n. :+1: @gillchristian!\n. This should totally work. Could you follow the instructions here to give a reproducible example? http://help.angular-formly.com\n.

See you on chat!\n. If you take a look at how onChange is called, you'll see why you're experiencing this. It's called with: model[options.key], options, this, $event which is roughly equivalent to: $modelValue, options, scope, $event. If you want the $viewValue, then you can get it from scope.fc.$viewValue.\nI'm going to close this issue because issues on this repo are reserved for big reports and feature requests.

Yeah, but api-check isn't part of Angular at all. Think of it like jQuery or lodash. Order matters.\n. Thanks for the issue and the diff. I'm mostly concerned with the comment // Avoid flicker when hideExpression promises resolve to true... I feel like setting field.hide = true would cause a flicker if the field is not hidden and the promise resolves to false...\nMy inclination is to not do this and instead have you use a work-around for this. Perhaps something like this: https://jsbin.com/pepode/edit?html,js,output\nIf this is sufficient for you, please close this issue. If not, maybe there's another way. Thanks!\n. I see, it seems like your use case is quite specific. I would actually recommend that you use a router like ui-router or ng-router and utilize the resolve functionality to resolve that asynchronous logic into your controller (so your controller isn't even loaded until that request has finished) and then you'll be able to simply assign the result to the hide property making your controller much easier to understand/maintain/etc.\nEither way, the flicker would be a problem for anyone who has the hide property being dynamic as the user interacts with the form and I can't do that to the rest of the users.\nSomething else you could do is put this particular field into its own form hidden behind an ng-if and do the async stuff outside of formly entirely.\nEither way, I don't think we'll be adding this to formly. If you need more help, please follow the instructions here: http://help.angular-formly.com\n. Will do, thanks for the suggestion! And thanks for using formly :-)\n. There is not. This has been asked for quite a bit. My guess is you want to know when it's done rendering because it's taking a long time to render. Please make sure that you're following the production tips to make sure that you disable some of the developer related things which should speed things up quite a bit for you. After that, you'll just have to make sure that your design is conducive to a performant form.\n. No plans, sorry\n. Good find. Here's the line of code that causes the problem. What do you think we could/should do about it? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/src/directives/formly-form.js#L293\n. I don't know if that would actually work... I don't think you can use $parse in a string expression like that.  Honestly, I think this is sort of an edge case and unless we can accomplish a solution that avoids the following two issues, I don't want to worry about it:\n1. It adds complexity to the codebase\n2. It reduces performance for the common case\nI don't know if there's a satisfactory way to accomplish both of those for this case.\n. I think that's acceptable.

Thanks for seeing that @pdemilly! @shealan, I highly recommend you look into ng-annotate to avoid problems like this.\n.

I hate to do this to you but do you think you could submit it one more time? We release angular-formly automatically using semantic-release which requires certain conventions for commit messages. See Pull Requests in CONTRIBUTING.md to learn about that.\nFor this change, a good commit message would be:\n```\nfix(formlyValidationMessages): handly falsy values\nThis should fix setting {min: 0} in field templateOptions to return proper message\n```\nThanks for your patience and your contribution! :smile: \n. It's perfect! Thanks for contributing! I'll merge this and it'll be automagically released soon :-)\n. My guess is that this is an odd behavior with how ui-bootstrap deals with focus for modals. Here's a solution that uses expressionProperties which will set the focus value after the form is initially digested: https://jsbin.com/qanumi/1/edit?html,js,output\n. This should be possible. But probably not easy. Feel free to submit a PR.\n. Yeah, parseGet is to allow for nested keys, like: name.first, so it's using the $parse service. My guess in the $parse service doesn't like a preceding number in a property getter or something. @MCKRUZ, do you think you could look into this?\n. I think that if the model is already an array, then angular will treat it like an array. Otherwise (if it's an object or undefined) angular will make it an object and set the property there. @dannycallaghan can you try initializing your model to an object and seeing if that works?\n. Actually... Yeah, that wont work... Nevermind...\n@MCKRUZ, I think that your solution should work pretty well. Just make sure to write/run tests and check the code coverage report generated in the coverage/lcov-report folder to make sure you're covering what you think you are :-) Thanks!\n. All the thanks is to @MCKRUZ on this one. I just clicked the merge button.\n. Yep, that's latest. @dannycallaghan, do you fancy making a pull request to add skipped test cases for your keys?\n. What if we changed it to:\n``` javascript\nfunction shouldNotUseParse(key) {\n  return angular.isNumber(key) || !containsSelector(string)\n}\n// maybe we should put these in formlyUtils...\nfunction containsSelector(string) {\n  return contains(string, '.') || (contains(string, '[') && contains(string, ']'))\n}\nfunction contains(a, b) {\n  if (!a || !a.indexOf) {\n    return false\n  }\n  return a.indexOf(b) !== -1\n}\n```\nWhat do you think?\n. Guessing it's been resolved.\n. You'll have to write custom code to track whether the current value is equal to the initial value. angular-formly adds an initialValue to all of your field's options (angular-formly uses it to reset the form). You could use that to determine the changed state of a given field. A function like this would do it for you:\njavascript\nfunction fieldHasChanged(field) {\n  return field.formControl.$modelValue !== field.initialValue\n}\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly.

Thank you!!! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf8a\n. Hi @david-nelson-moscow, I don't personally have any plans to work on an Angular 2 version of angular-formly. That (of course) does not preclude anyone else from working on it.\nOriginally I had planned on making an Angular 2 version of angular-formly. However with so many things competing for my time, I can't justify spending time on it. I was able to justify working on angular-formly before because I was using it at work and I used Angular heavily. But I will soon be changing jobs and will be using React. So I no longer have a use case for angular-formly.\nPerhaps someone on the @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read team will be up to the challenge.\nThanks for asking!\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Fantastic. Thanks for working on this! Merging.\nAs a friendly reminder, the issue number should be at the bottom of the commit per our commit convention guidelines. So this one should be:\n```\nfix(formly-field): Add better detection of nested keys\nCloses #566\n``\n. Thanks again!\n.resetModelshould update those values. Could you please reproduce your issue using [issue.angular-formly.com](http://issue.angular-formly.com/)? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. Looks like after we callresetModelon all the individual fields ([right here](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/917ec263ddcc4902fa2cb9dc167da0734f9d5ed6/src/directives/formly-form.js#L207-L215)) we need to set the form'stouchedandpristine` state like we do with the individual fields (here).\nI'm open to a pull request for this! Anyone's welcome to try. Just follow these instructions\n. This issue should be closed I think. Let me know if you experience otherwise!\n. @janneman001 could you provide an example of this behavior?\n. Here you can use this as a starter, then just post the link in here :+1: \n. In the last major version expression was changed to statement. Here's a working example:\nhttps://jsbin.com/purobo/edit?js,console,output\n. I've updated the example. Thanks!\n. Thank you! :-) this should be released automatically in a few minutes.\n. Looks like somehow I forgot to add the webpack Uglify plugin to the webpack config when I changed some stuff. If someone would like to PR it I'll merge when I land :airplane: :-)\n. Hi @benoror, the uglify loader actually has some problems with it. We should actually remove it from the devDependencies. We should instead use the Uglify Plugin\n. Thanks @benoror! :+1: \n. Actually, sorry, could you make this a fix rather than a chore? That way we get an automatic release\n. Fantastic. Thank you!\n. Dying is probably the more appropriate term: https://gofore.com/ohjelmistokehitys/stop-using-bower/\n. Actually, you don't need to use browserify, webpack or any other module packager even if you use npm. You can just reference the built files just as you would without those tools. Most packages distribute a stand-alone distributable that works in the browser (like angular-formly).\nAs for the location of the installed files, as long as they're listed in your package.json dependencies then they'll be in the root of node_modules (regardless of npm version). And if someone moves where the distributable file goes then that's a breaking change (and would happen with bower as well).\nSo, for example, for angular-formly, you could use npm by installing it like so:\nbash\n$ npm i angular-formly --save\nThen in an html file you could reference that like so:\nhtml\n<script src=\"node_modules/angular-formly/dist/formly.js\"></script>\nAnd that'd work just perfectly :-)\n. @dmitriz, I'm not sure I understand what you're describing, but if I had to guess, you're using npm in the wrong way.\n\nWhen you say \"as long as they're listed in your package.json dependencies\", do you mean -- before the installation?\n\nNo, they don't need to be there before installation. When you install the module explicitly (either from an npm install angular-formly or from having it in your package.json), it'll go in the root of your node_modules directory. \nNot sure what to tell you, but I'm pretty sure that you're not using npm correctly if you're experiencing that.\n. Yeah, generally every project that depends on npm or bower will have a package.json or bower.json (respectively) to list dependencies. Then all the dependencies for the project will be added to as a sibling directory to the package.json (in the case of npm) called node_modules. If you're wanting to spread node_modules directories all over your project, that's a pretty unconventional way to use npm.\n. I'm not sure what the webhook is for. This gulp task will run as part of our automated releases on travis. What's the purpose of the webhook?\n. Merged and webhook created. Let me know if you need anything else!\n. That's one way to do it. I'd welcome a PR to add that :-)\n. Sorry it took so long to get back! It'll be in attributeOnly because (as @SteveShaffer mentioned) there is no angular equivalent (like ng-step).\n. Hi @rayhooker. Thanks for the question. I actually just recently answered this on my AMA here. Let me know if you have further questions :-)\n. New release is out. But I guess it doesn't fix this issue still exists.\n. This looks pretty good. Please just use extras as I mention in the inline comment and I'd prefer that this new API is tested. Thanks!\n. P.S. Let me know when you update the PR (github wont notify me).\n. Thanks for doing this. The tests are great. I wonder if it might be easier if  manualModelWatcher could be a string or function itself. This way you could have a single watcher that applies to all fields. I feel like this could accomplish the need and we already have an API for specific watchers on fields.\n. With that, do we really need the extras watcher? We already have a mechanism for adding a watcher to a field... I'd rather avoid adding another way to do the same thing.\n. Right. What I'm saying is for that second bullet point, you can use the watcher property to add custom watchers. It basically does the same thing as the watch is extras\n. Sorry. I guess I didn't understand your problem well enough. I still think that it would be valuable to be able to disable the deep watch and provide a custom watch function for the whole form.\n. Ah, indeed... Hmmm.... I wonder if there's a way we could enhance the existing API to account for the use case\n. I like your first suggestion. I think that we could implement it in a backward compatible way and I don't think that it is terribly confusing:\njavascript\n{\n  ...\n  watcher: [{\n    expression: 'model.type',\n    runFieldExpressions: true,\n  }]\n},\n{\n  ...\n  watcher: [{\n    expression: 'model.type',\n    listener: () => {},\n    runFieldExpressions: true,\n  }]\n}\nI think that both of those would run the field expressions, but the second field would also run the custom listener.\nI really don't see anything bad with this approach. The idea is that it totally separates disabling deep model watching (or specifying custom watcher) from custom field watchers which I think is a good call.\n. That's probably a little bit too magical I think. Maybe if we added another property to options that was watchAllExpressions in addition to disableModelWatcher or something like that. I just want the API to describe what's going on.\n. Haven't looked at the code yet, but I can tell you right now that there's a reason that hideExpression isn't evaluated the same as expressionProperties and that's because a common scenario for the hide property. That is: If a field is initialized as hide: true, then it will not be compiled. Therefore there will be no scope to evaluated this expression and the field will never be shown (because the expression can't be evaluated).\nSo, if you could removed that piece, then I'll give the code a look. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks a ton!\n. If you wanted to fix the model property in those expressions, you could add to this object. Would require a breaking change though. Feel free to do that (though make sure your commit message follows the convention)\n. This is excellent @kwypchlo. Thank you. If you could address my one comment, I give this a :+1:. I would like someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators and another person from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read to also review this PR and give a :+1: or :-1:\n. Thanks @kamilkisiela! I'll go ahead and merge this in then.\n. This will be auto-released in a few minutes. Thanks a bunch @kwypchlo!\n. I'm not sure what's causing your issue. What version of node and npm are you using?\n. I'm sorry, I'm not able to reproduce your issue myself. One thing you might double check is that you've got the peerDependencies like angular and api-check installed before you try to install angular-formly.\n. Yes, this is totally possible and the way it should be done is with plugins of which there are several. I'm pretty confident that for the most part angular-formly is \"done.\" Any other functionality needed can/should probably be added via a plugin.\nFeel free to create a plugin yourself. It should be quite straightforward. For example, the Matching Two Fields example you reference could be made a plugin with a single file that does this:\n``` javascript\nangular\n  .module('angular-formly-match-field', [])\n  .config(function config(formlyConfigProvider) {\n    // set templates here\n    formlyConfigProvider.setType({\n      name: 'matchField',\n      defaultOptions: function matchFieldDefaultOptions(options) {\n        return {\n          extras: {\n            validateOnModelChange: true\n          },\n          expressionProperties: {\n            'templateOptions.disabled': function(viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n              var matchField = find(scope.fields, 'key', options.data.fieldToMatch);\n              if (!matchField) {\n                throw new Error('Could not find a field for the key ' + options.data.fieldToMatch);\n              }\n              var model = options.data.modelToMatch || scope.model;\n              var originalValue = model[options.data.fieldToMatch];\n              var invalidOriginal = matchField.formControl && matchField.formControl.$invalid;\n              return !originalValue || invalidOriginal;\n            }\n          },\n          validators: {\n            fieldMatch: {\n              expression: function(viewValue, modelValue, fieldScope) {\n                var value = modelValue || viewValue;\n                var model = options.data.modelToMatch || fieldScope.model;\n                return value === model[options.data.fieldToMatch];\n              },\n              message: options.data.matchFieldMessage || '\"Must match\"'\n            }\n          }\n        };\n    function find(array, prop, value) {\n      var foundItem;\n      array.some(function(item) {\n        if (item[prop] === value) {\n          foundItem = item;\n        }\n        return !!foundItem;\n      });\n      return foundItem;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n});\n```\nIf you're interested in creating this plugin, I recommend you check out my egghead.io series: How to Write an Open Source Library and look at the recommendations on the plugins page. Good luck!\n. @slavafomin, why can't you help? You're welcome to make a PR. Just make the test pass :-)\n. If you need help, I'm sure that someone (or I) could help point you in the right direction. You might also check the CONTRIBUTING.md :+1: \n. Just to clarify, this is intended to only run the hide expression right? Other expressionProperties won't work until the field itself is compiled.\n. Based on the test, I'm guessing that is the case. Thanks! \n. Yes, go to the link function where we're chaining the steps of the promises to compile the template and just add another step or add to an existing step\n. I really think that you could find another way to accomplish what you're trying to do. Could you create an example of what you're trying to do following these instructions?\nEither way, I don't think that we'll be doing anything significant to change the behavior of the ngModelAttrsTemplateManipulator and I'm sure that we can figure out another way to do what you're trying to do. So I'll go ahead and close this issue. Good luck!\n. Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is by following the instructions at help.angular-formly.com.

The examples seem to be working fine for me... Could you check them again?\n. Thanks @kamilkisiela! :D\n. @benoror looks like you updated the PR. Looks good to me. Anyone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read wanna review this and push the merge button?\n. Sorry, I just merged another PR :cry: \n. Sorry about that @benoror.\n. :clap: \n. Ah, yes, probably should.\n. Anyone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators wanna take this one? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/tree/master/app/states/root/children/users/components/data\n. :+1: even better! Thanks :D\n. Here are the GUI builders I'm aware of. Built by others: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/gui-form-builders\n. That's what they promise. If you have problems with them, contact their respective maintainers.\n. These are great questions for the chat: http://chat.angular-formly.com\n. Thanks for the help @benoror.\nHmmm.... Yeah, I feel like this is a bit of an edge case and would prefer that it's handled outside of angular-formly unless I can see a simple, tested implementation. My inclination is to say this is outside of the scope of the project though. Sorry @koraybalci.\n. Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is by following the instructions at help.angular-formly.com. The GitHub issues on this project are reserved for feature requests and bug reports, so I'm going to close this issue. See you on chat and Stack Overflow!\n. Technically this should have almost everything that this has. I think the only thing that's missing is: originalModel, and formOptions. The other properties are actually properties on the $scope of the formly-form which is where the expression is evaluated and therefore you should have access to it in your expression.\nI'd happily accept a (tested) PR to add these properties. If you're keen on it, that's great. If you need help, maybe someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read could give you a little guidance. Thanks everyone!\n. Great, you might take a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md file as well :+1: \n. Yeah, originalModel can simply be: $scope.model (the form's $scope). formOptions will need to be $scope.options (the form's $scope)...\n. Yep! Feel free to close it. Thanks!\n. Feel free to makeapullrequest.com\n. Seems to be up for me and isitup.org https://isitup.org/docs.angular-formly.com\n. How's it looking for you now?\n. You're validator needs to check for empty and return valid if it's empty. The examples on the website do this. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. That's fine. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Mind adding a test or two that verifies these changes work (and to prevent them from breaking in the future?)\n. Sure! :+1: \nI'd probably put it in the section of tests that test hideExpression because that's one of the main places that leverages this feature. Find that here.\nI would take the existing beforeEach and two it blocks and nest them in another describe with a title of something like: behavior when the model changes\nThen I would create another describe block for your tests with the title of something like as a string. And then add an it with the message: should have access to almost all the same properties as an expressionProperties string expression.\nThen in your test, you'll want to initialize scope.fields, scope.model, and scope.options (scope.options should have a formState object). And for scope.fields you can use the getNewField helper function (see other places for how that's used. It's pretty much just a helper so you can omit the template/type/etc.).\nIt may be a bit tricky because you can't really do assertions in string expressions, but the returned value of the string expression is assigned to the field's hide property. So you might try something like this:\njavascript\nscope.model = {}\nscope.options = {formState: {}}\nscope.fields = [getNewField({\n  hideExpression: `\n    options === options.data.field &&\n    index === 0 &&\n    formState === options.data.formOptions.formState &&\n    originalModel === options.data.originalModel &&\n    formOptions === options.data.formOptions\n  `, // can't reliably test `formId` unfortunately\n  data: {\n    originalModel: scope.model,\n    formOptions: scope.options,\n  }\n})]\nscope.fields[0].data.field = scope.fields[0]\nThen invoke compileAndDigest and assert that the scopes.fields[0].hide is true.\nLet me know what you think or feel free to change whatever you like. Looking forward to seeing this. Thanks!\n. It's for anything you want. Because angular-formly validates all of the properties you provide, if you have any other things you need to provide, they either go in templateOptions (if it's specific for the template or type that you're using) or in data if it's just general data that you need to get your job done (like in this case).\n. I'm fine with either way. Feel free to add more tests in this pr, feel free to squash if you like.\n. If you could fix that comment and the name of that data property (to parentScope maybe), then this is great and I'll merge it. Thanks!\n. Perfect. Thank you!\n. If you're simply using the global, then rather than requiring it, it's available as a global apiCheck. Then you disable it the same as in the docs.\n. No, angular-formly uses it heavily. You definitely want to disable it for production. There's an example on the website for production tips that uses globals.\nI'm going to let you look at that and consider this issue closed. Check out the chat for more questions.\n. I'm sorry, but as you can see in the comments, I said I don't want to add another error message because it simply doesn't make sense to have two error messages for the same thing. The very next line is the same error. If you want to update that message, we can talk about that, but adding another message is something I simply won't do.\n. You can do it in your submit handler. The submit handler is on the same scope as the form options.\n. The GitHub issues on this repo are reserved for feature requests and bug reports. All questions should follow these instructions: help.angular-formly.com\nSo I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.\n. The example is confusing, but it's definitely still working. Read the descriptions carefully. Sorry it's confusing.\n\n. Good luck! If you wanna create an example of what you're trying to do and share it in the chat or on stack overflow that'd probably help :-) help.angular-formly.com\n. I'm not certain I understand what you mean by this. Could you give a more clear explanation of what you mean?\n. Even better, maybe you could go to the chat and describe what you're trying to do. Perhaps someone will be able to help you find another way.\n. Could you please reproduce your issue using issue.angular-formly.com? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. > I can make this work with the current form by assigning both the form and the formly-form to the same property\nThis is how it's intended to work. You're basically passing the form to formly-form telling it what to use for the NgFormCtrl. Formly does some magic under the hood to manage the NgFormCtrl to make the API more clear. Unfortunately that leads to issues like the one you're seeing, but most of the time it's better than the alternative.\nI don't think there's anything I can do to fix this. Just name your form and pass it to formly-form.\n. Could you please reproduce your issue using issue.angular-formly.com? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. This appears to be a bug. defaultOptions should work great as a function. But it appears to not work in this case. However, if we make the abstractType an object instead, it seems to work fine (like so).\nI doubt that I'll have time to work on this I'm afraid. But feel free to makeapullrequest.com :-)\n. Thanks for letting me know! This should be fixed in a few minutes. Sorry about that!\n. Please re-open this if it's not fixed in 30 minutes.\n. Hey @johannesjo,\nI commented on your question on stack overflow.\nBecause the github issues on this project are reserved for bug reports and feature requests, I'm going to close this issue. If you have further questions, please take them to chat.angular-formly.com\n. I would personally say that it's out of scope for the core project. It would, however, make a great plugin. You might think about giving the repeating-section a look.\n. :+1:\n. I should also mention that managing this project is primarily a matter of support at this point. There are definitely some bugs and a few tiny features, but for the most part, this project is done.\n. Thanks for the suggestion @ShashankaNataraj. That currently exists (and invitations are still open #481). I'm looking for someone to hand off account information, passwords, tokens, etc. to.\n. If you're interested, I published a 3 minute podcast about this: https://www.briefs.fm/episodes/570\n. @jorgemarcondes fantastic. I'll add you to the collaborators on the org. Thanks!\n. Sweet @barkoczi, I'll add you to the collaborators.\n. Thanks @agileurbanite! I'll add you to the collaborators as well.\nFor everyone on @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read, you could really help out by investigating, reviewing, closing, and making PRs for the issues. Also, make sure to watch the repo, and the various formly-js repos as well.\nIf I see someone really taking initiative on the issues and things then I'll happily hand over write access and eventually publish access. Thanks!\n. @Stwissel, talk with @mohammedzamakhan about how you can help with https://github.com/formly-js/ng2-formly :-)\n. > I would hate to see formly go un-maintained.\nLikewise. I've stopped watching the repos because I can't really help out anymore. My plan was to hand over control to anyone making pull requests, but nobody has really done that consistently. This tells me that either nobody's willing to step up to the plate of ownership or angular-formly is done.\nI think at this point, @BarryThePenguin is probably the best candidate for ownership. What do you say @BarryThePenguin?\n. @sumitasr, I'll add you to the read-only collaborators. Start making PRs and I'll give you write access :)\n. I'm fairly confident that formly is still a prime solution for building forms with AngularJS. It's been steadily growing in the number of downloads since I posted this almost a year ago. Formly's not dead. But based on the fact that the library has had very little development (and no active maintainers), but still growing in popularity tells me that it's \"done.\"\nFormly is no more dead than AngularJS. It's just done.. Another interesting fact: angular-formly comes up (basically) first in pretty much every search criteria on npm for \"angular forms\": https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=angular%20forms\nI think it's safe to say that angular-formly is still the most popular abstraction for forms with angular.. @LuigiDAmico, from the README badge, you can see there are about 12,000 downloads on npm per month. It's extremely hard to tell from download numbers how many users there are. There are no active contributors or maintainers, so I've kept ownership of the project, but I don't watch the repo so I'm not sure how the community is doing (as far as people helping one another out or people finding the answers they need). If you want to contribute, please start helping out in the community.\nI think that the project is more-or-less \"done\" based on the fact that there are rarely new issues filed on the project and no critical issues and rarely any pull requests. It's helped tens (hundreds) of thousands of developers build better forms with AngularJS :). Hi @kwypchlo!\nThanks for making this. I'll review it more closely soon. But if you could double check the commit message conventions, I don't think this follows it. Also, pay close attention to what you need to do in the commit message if you're introducing a breaking change please. Thanks!\n. Awesome. Thanks for doing that! I'll get back to you soon hopefully!\n. I think this PR is great other than the one note that I mentioned. Let me know if you have questions about that.\n. Looks good to me! Thoughts @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read?\n. Hopefully the auto-release works for this one. We've had a bit of trouble with that recently.\n. Nope :-( #643 is tracking issues with the auto-release process...\n. Thanks a ton for the help @gillchristian! @vukan71, because this appears to be more of a matter of help and support than a real bug or feature request, I'm going to close this issue. Feel free to continue discussion or move this to chat.angular-formly.com :+1: \n. Looks good to me. But I would like someone else to merge this: @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators \n. Anyone in @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read who feels confident they can have commit access, I'll add you to @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators :-)\n. Unfortunately it looks like it's not fixed\n. Actually, it looks like this wasn't auto-released for some reason :-( Filing an issue.\n. Yeah, it hasn't yet been released because there's a problem. So no, there's not really a way... Feel free to help out here: #643\n. If I publish manually, will things go back to normal?\n. Alrighty, released 7.5.1. I'll merge #639 after I verify this is fixed with the new release.\n. Looks like bower's broken as well... I'm actually tempted to stop officially supporting bower and direct people to the solution in #589 with npmcdn.com\n. > [imho] What a mess ...\nAgreed... :-(\n@DrDanRyan, do you have any ideas of how to fix this issue? I'm not sure what's going on with the release, but if you'd like to look into it, please feel free: https://travis-ci.org/formly-js/angular-formly/builds/111880609\n. Good thing you can continue using version 7 and it works just as well as it always has :-)\n. Ah! Neat! Want to add it to the examples site? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-example\n. Hmmm... I'm not seeing it here...\n. Thank you for the help @BarryThePenguin!\n. Could you check it again. It's working fine for me.\n. Hi @MCKRUZ, please move discussion over to #643 \n. Hi @JessyRiordan, yes, this is being tracked in #643, thank you for your patience (and help!)\n. I would recommend you write your own directive that has default options you can use and passes those to formly-form. It's much better to compose things together than to have global options. Anyone want to provide an example of this?\n. Duplicate of #643\n. A wrapper without defined name or type will be set as the default template. This could probably be made more clear in the docs\n\nYou can have a default (used by all templates), named template wrappers, and typed template wrappers (used by fields with the specified type)\n\nIf you give the first wrapper a name, or types, you'll see this behavior is corrected: https://jsbin.com/tafiwa/edit?html,js,output\nIn the future, please ask questions in the chat: http://chat.angular-formly.com thanks!\n. Just realized that perhaps you didn't ask this in the chat because you legitimately thought it was a bug. Thanks for the reproducible example! That made it much easier to help you :sparkles: \n. LGTM, could I have someone else review and merge this? Ping @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators\n. Thanks @kwypchlo!\n\n. Have you tried https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update\n. Any idea why the build is busted? Looks like a shell issue? Maybe related to the quotes you removed? Maybe we should do escaped double quotes?\n. Thanks @BarryThePenguin!\n. Hi @dariusjb and @maxime-beguin,\nThanks for reporting this. It needs more investigation and possibly a fix.\n\nCould anyone provide a fix, please?\n\nThis is a community project, you could makeapullrequest.com or add a bounty on this issue to motivate someone else to do so.\n. Thanks for your interest in angular-formly. The best way to get help is by following the instructions at help.angular-formly.com. The GitHub issues on this project are reserved for feature requests and bug reports, so I'm going to close this issue. See you on chat and Stack Overflow!\n. Could you check back in an hour or so? I think RawGit is having trouble...\n. fixed\n. This looks good to me. Thanks @tuxtina! Once the build passes, if someone else wants to review and hit the merge button that'd be great.\n. I would prefer to explicitly check for undefined as well :+1:\n. LGTM! Would like to get another reviewer on this though.\n. This should probably be updated if we want it merged. Things have changed quite a bit since March 19th, 2016....\n. This looks just fine :+1:\n. I'd still like someone else who actually uses the library still to review and merge this though.\n. I am, but would love to give some other people access.\n. I think this looks good. Could you update the commit message so the subject isn't so long?\nI'll let someone else merge this once you've done that. Thanks!\n. LGTM! Thanks!\n. You should hide your form behind  ng-if=\"vm.fields.length\" which will prevent Angular from compiling the form until your fields have loaded.\n. Yeah, adding fields dynamically isn't well supported. Best to have them all at compile time and hide the ones that shouldn't be showing.\n. If this is really part of the specification, it's odd and unexpected. In formly we often do things that abstract away the unexpected parts of the specification. So I think a PR to abstract this away would be acceptable. My thinking is to add a hidden field if there's only one field in fields. Could easily accomplish this in the formly-form template right above this line:\nhtml\n<input type=\"hidden\" ng-if=\"fields.length === 1\" />\nI'm thinking that should do it. Any pull request should accompany tests. makeapullrequest.com :-)\n. Hmmm... I suppose that this might be expected behavior on the part of users. Maybe it's better for the developer to be explicit about how they solve this problem rather than just doing it ourselves.\n. Actually, I'm pretty confident that the API for formly is already too big. You could easily accomplish this with a field transform: https://jsbin.com/yinuda/edit?js,output\n``` javascript\napp.run(function(formlyConfig) {\n  formlyConfig.extras.fieldTransform.push(fieldTransform)\nfunction fieldTransform(fields) {\n    return fields.concat({\n      type: 'input',\n      templateOptions: {\n        type: 'hidden'\n      },\n      hideExpression: 'fields.length !== 2' // where 2 === this one plus one another.\n    })\n  }\n})\n``\n. If you'd like, you can create a plugin for this and I'll add it to [the plugins list](http://docs.angular-formly.com/page/plugins)\n. Hi @seibs! Thanks for the PR! This looks great to me, could I have someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators or @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read review this as well?\n. @immortalcy, actually, if you look at the implementation of the example above, it allows you to specify thengOptionsat the field level, and actually you can specify thengOptionsattribute for a specific field usingngModelAttrs` as well. I think that's the generic solution you're looking for...\n. Hi @xphong, I'm not seeing the same thing you are. You can see it working here: https://jsbin.com/bivoxoz/edit?html,js,output\nCould you please reproduce your issue using issue.angular-formly.com? It will help us determine what exactly the problem is that you're describing and how it could be fixed. Thanks!\n. I would not recommend this change be made.\n. This is great. Thanks for working on it. Any other reviewers wanna pitch in here? Should probably get at least one other.\n. :clap:\n. LGTM! I'll let someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators-read give the thumbs up and someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators merge the PR.\n. Agreed. We could make that a breaking change in a future release.\n. Could someone from @angular-formly-collaborators review and merge this?. Sorry, bad @ mention. Someone from @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators please review and merge this. Thanks.. I don't maintain this library anymore, but I should say that you'll definitely want to look at the production tips here: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/tips\nIt will definitely be slow if you don't do those things..

Sure thing. \u00a0Here's the use case:\n1. We present a form to the user with some default values filled in from our database. The default values are injected into the form definition json at initial render time, so they exclusively use the \"default\" property to set initial values.\n2. The user completes the form, filling in missing values and changing defaults provided to their correct values.\n3. User submits the revised results data.\n4. Data is reviewed and, if not accepted by the processor (human judgement), is sent back for further data entry by the user. At this point, we want to reload the form with the values that were last submitted in the result, rather than the initial defaults that were extracted from the database.\nPut more simply, what I want is this:\nWe need the ability to populate the values in a formly form from the json results of that same form via a mechanism as simple as .loadValues(jsonValues) (or, obviously .loadValues(objectParsedFromJsonValues).\nBest,\n\n-- jas\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreysullivan\nOn Aug 19, 2014, at 09:55 AM, \"Kent C.

Yes, that approach works for me (though I'd love to see a sample implementation that allows us to bring in our UI framework of choice on top of the base bootstrap implementation (we've been migrating from Angular-UI to Angustrap because it seems better supported).\n. kenctcdobbs, I think an implementation in AngularStrap and Angular-UI Bootstrap would be great.  Even support for the base bootstrap popover functionality would be great (though it'd need to be angularized anyway, so why reinvent the wheel?). But perhaps the base implementation for purists would also be ideal.\n. Per the discussion in #77, My bounty would be for either plain-vanilla bootstrap or an AngularStrap plugin set that allowed the help popovers to be added.\n. I did this on a separate project.

So yes, the new version does submit buttons differently.  I guess this question is just about the (possibly) repeated template.\n. I saw that much, but there remain questions:\n1. I'd like to see a working example where the validator field is a function as opposed to an expression.\n2. The validator sets the validity of a specific field, but I don't see any way to indicate what it means. In the example above, I can conceive of creating a custom validator  that would flag the field as invalid when all of the 3 fields are empty, and then applying it to all 3 fields. However, from a UX perspective, this seems like it would be confusing to the user (since they won't necessarily know what it means that all 3 fields are marked as invalid/error). I suppose one could add a template field with additional information which has a hideExpression keyed to the validity of those fields (right?), though that feels like a bit of a hack.\nAll that validators can do is mark a field as valid or invalid, right? No way to message to the user when (or how) something is invalid?\n. We load our formly form json from a service, and no permutation that our devs has tried results in valid json when we try to embed a function in the json.  Simple example:\n[\n    {\n        \"template\": \"<div><h3><b>Simple Title Goes Here</b></h3></div>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"key\": \"sample\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"label\": \"Simple user\",\n        \"validators\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"iAmSam\",\n                \"validate\": function(value) {\n                    console.log(\"name\", value);\n                    return\"sam\"===value;\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"required\": false\n    }\n]\n. We need valid json because the formly data is loaded via service and jsonparsed into an object.\nThe example I gave is a simplistic academic example (which it's easy to see how to do with an expression), but the team would like to be able to log values out in a validator and do complex multi-step actions when validating. \nIt's also not clear how to reference other formly field values from an expression (is it even possible?)\nThe examples with a function all add it directly to the formly formData though the $scope, which is not possible if you're loading your formly data on the fly as we are.\n. Thanks, Kent. I see how they can accomplish what they want to from that. \nGiven the value of formly as a declarative way to generate a form, it would be nice if there were some way to use functional validators from a declarative starting point.\nThis would entail some way to encode the functions in valid json and then expanding them to first-class functions at runtime.\nFirst thoughts would be using eval to create a function object from a string containing its source, which makes me shudder.

Kent,\nI have a usage question for you.\nCurrently, we're populating a form with default values based on existing data in our database, but we cache it for offline use by our customers.\nWhen they edit a form \"in flight\", I'd like them to be able to re-load the form but with the current values in the resultset pre-populated. \u00a0My developer on this says that he doesn't think that's possible, but I'd hope that isn't true. I haven't had a chance to dig into it (not sure when I will), but I was wondering if there is a built-in facility for reloading the data output by formly back into the formly form, or if not, if you think that's a feasible feature to bounty?\nBest,\n\n-- jas\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreysullivan\nOn Aug 18, 2014, at 10:41 PM, \"Kent C.

Sure thing. \u00a0Here's the use case:\n1. We present a form to the user with some default values filled in from our database. The default values are injected into the form definition json at initial render time, so they exclusively use the \"default\" property to set initial values.\n2. The user completes the form, filling in missing values and changing defaults provided to their correct values.\n3. User submits the revised results data.\n4. Data is reviewed and, if not accepted by the processor (human judgement), is sent back for further data entry by the user. At this point, we want to reload the form with the values that were last submitted in the result, rather than the initial defaults that were extracted from the database.\nPut more simply, what I want is this:\nWe need the ability to populate the values in a formly form from the json results of that same form via a mechanism as simple as .loadValues(jsonValues) (or, obviously .loadValues(objectParsedFromJsonValues).\nBest,\n\n-- jas\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreysullivan\nOn Aug 19, 2014, at 09:55 AM, \"Kent C.

Could you merge this pull request and publish a new version to bower? Thanks in adavance.\nFrom Angular doc, the patterns for ng-options include:\nlabel group by group for value in array  // current code base\nselect as label group by group for value in array // my suggested fix\nHaving option.name group by option.group for option in options.options will save an array element (option) to the model. While having option.value as option.name group by option.group for option in options.options will save the value property of array element to the model. There is no change to the UI, the dropdown is populated with option.name.\nThanks in advance\n. @astrism having the key/value allows to use angular-formly for localised apps.

    "quietlyconfident": "(Sorry if this is an inappropriate message for the notify-me issue / mailing list.  Happy to move the question(s) elsewhere if so.)\nA few questions ( really, one in several parts ):\n1 Would there be any interest among the users / developers / maintainers of the app in somehow linking this form-presentation app with a form-building app?  Such as, perhaps, this one: http://kelp404.github.io/angular-form-builder/\n2 Linking could mean, incorporating that code base into this code base, synchronizing the schemas, and bundling the two apps together.\n3 Linking could also mean, just synchronizing the schemas so that the form-builder outputs JSON that the form-presenter knows what to do with?\n4 Either way, ideally, the the form-presenter and the form-builder would speak the same language.\n5 Interest here could of course range from, \"that sounds like an interesting idea\" to \"would be willing to work on it as a paid project\" to \"would consider accepting suitable pull requests implementing the idea\" to \"would be interested in collaborating on it immediately.\"\n. Cool!  I took the liberty of posting this bounty: https://bountify.co/modify-json-output-of-angular-form-builder-will-tip-50 , which would make that form building app work with this app  Hopefully if that works out, the next step of combining the two would be relatively easy.\n. Looks good to me!\n. There is a specification here: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/wiki/JSON-Specification .  It just isn't a JSON-Schema specification.\nThis is hitting below the belt, because the author admitted on posting that it was very beta :)  But nonetheless there is a spec.\n. Slight clarification here; I was not fully educated in how angular-schema-form worked.\nIn angular-schema-form:\n1. The Form Schema is itself a JSON Schema, and\n2. There is not (yet) a Form Schema Specification.  In other words, you cannot mechanically validate your Form Schema.\nNonetheless, I think the suggestion / request stands. . . it would be good to have a formal schema specification for against which an individual Form Spec could be validated.\n\n. Ha ha, mostly what I want you to do is consider and tell me what you think.  This is related to the \"integration with a form-builder\" discussion.\nTo integrate with a form builder program, the form-builder will need to create output in a format that the form-displaying program (angular formly) can understand.  Often, when this sort of thing is done, the pattern is to develop a contract (e.g. API, schema, etc.) that both applications / layers / etc. can depend on.  \nI propose that this contract should be a JSON Schema document, because then you could use an out of the box schema validator on either the client side (e.g. tv4) or the server side (e.g. a python / ruby package) to validate the \"form\" that has been built by the form builder.\n. Chiming in on the utility of my (currently closed) feature request. . .\nAngular-Formly takes in a JSON document (the Form Description Document or FDD) and uses it to render a form.  According to the documentation, validation is accomplished via a combination of Angular's built-in validation and the special validators object which contains validation functions.  Put differently, the \"schema\" for the data in a Formly form consists of the FDD, plus the built-in Angular validation directives, plus optionally the special validation functions in the \"validators\" object.\nChanging this so that the FDD is a JSON Schema document has at least two benefits:\n1. You  (the Formly maintainer(s)) can use other validators (like TV4) to do the validation and not write/maintain validation related code.\n2. The JSON Schema document becomes the single-source-of-truth on the schema for the data structure.  The end-user could use the schema to validate the data in other places (e.g. on the server) without having to have a separate schema which is kept in sync with the Formly FDD.\nThis is the underlying approach taken by Angular Schema Form.\n. No, I think thats a different thing than what k010 is asking about here. (But I've proposed it in another issue.) I apologize, in advance and in a continuing fashion, for sowing confusion.  Discussions about schemas get very meta in a hurry and it is hard to keep track of what we're talking about :)\nI think that what k010 is talking about in this thread is, the FDD should be a JSON Schema, so that you can validate the Data Model against it.  To make this more concrete, check out the Formly Demo.  On the left is the \"Fields\" pane which contains a JSON document which describes the form (i've taken to calling this the form description document or FDD but happy to use some other term if you'd like.)  Then on the right is the \"Data Model\" which is a JSON object.  If Fields/FDD was a JSON schema, then you could validate the data model against it with a JSON Schema validator.  Thus using that JSON schema validator you could copy-and-paste the Fields JSON into the top pane, and the Data JSON into the bottom pane, and click the button, and it would tell you that the model was valid or not.\nOr, a more useful real-world scenario. . . Perhaps your server-side application doesn't trust that your client side application will always give it good data.  So you want to validate the data in the browser as you enter it, but then when it hits the server you want to validate it again.  If the Fields/FDD is a JSON schema, then you can do that without having two separate documents which describe the data model (e.g. a server-side validation schema in some standard schema language PLUS the Formly \"Fields\" document on the client side).\n. Ha ha, thats ok.  When wing nuts such as myself from the internet start muddying up your project with crazy issues you're entitled to close them :)\nBut yeah, that is exactly right, the FDD could validate the data model and describe the form fields if it was a JSON schema.  Perhaps it would clarify to point out that per the JSON Schema Spec a JSON Schema may have properties that are not keywords.\nRe: your proposal:\n\nOne thing that might make sense is to add a schema property to the field config that allows you to use a JSON Schema validator to validate the model. This would be in lieu of validators but would behave just like validators in that it would $setValidity for the NgModelController based on whether the schema validation passed. Would this be a good api to accomplish what you're talking about?\n\nYes, I think that is a great idea.  If you add a schema property to the FDD, then you could validate the data model against the FDD.\nMy next thought is, if you did just that and stopped, there would be some redundancy between the schema property and the remainder of the FDD.  For example, consider just the First Name / Last Name fields of the Formly example.  Both the schema and the FDD would indicate the key, and the type, for example.  What the schema would not necessarily have is 'label', 'placeholder', and 'order'.  \nBut, if you added those form description properties to the schema (OK because, a schema may have properties that are not keywords), and we teach Formly how to read it, then rather than having a schema inside the form description, you have a schema which is the form description and also can be used directly to validate the document.\n. (Sorry if this is an inappropriate message for the notify-me issue / mailing list.  Happy to move the question(s) elsewhere if so.)\nA few questions ( really, one in several parts ):\n1 Would there be any interest among the users / developers / maintainers of the app in somehow linking this form-presentation app with a form-building app?  Such as, perhaps, this one: http://kelp404.github.io/angular-form-builder/\n2 Linking could mean, incorporating that code base into this code base, synchronizing the schemas, and bundling the two apps together.\n3 Linking could also mean, just synchronizing the schemas so that the form-builder outputs JSON that the form-presenter knows what to do with?\n4 Either way, ideally, the the form-presenter and the form-builder would speak the same language.\n5 Interest here could of course range from, \"that sounds like an interesting idea\" to \"would be willing to work on it as a paid project\" to \"would consider accepting suitable pull requests implementing the idea\" to \"would be interested in collaborating on it immediately.\"\n. Cool!  I took the liberty of posting this bounty: https://bountify.co/modify-json-output-of-angular-form-builder-will-tip-50 , which would make that form building app work with this app  Hopefully if that works out, the next step of combining the two would be relatively easy.\n. Looks good to me!\n. There is a specification here: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/wiki/JSON-Specification .  It just isn't a JSON-Schema specification.\nThis is hitting below the belt, because the author admitted on posting that it was very beta :)  But nonetheless there is a spec.\n. Slight clarification here; I was not fully educated in how angular-schema-form worked.\nIn angular-schema-form:\n1. The Form Schema is itself a JSON Schema, and\n2. There is not (yet) a Form Schema Specification.  In other words, you cannot mechanically validate your Form Schema.\nNonetheless, I think the suggestion / request stands. . . it would be good to have a formal schema specification for against which an individual Form Spec could be validated.\n\n. Ha ha, mostly what I want you to do is consider and tell me what you think.  This is related to the \"integration with a form-builder\" discussion.\nTo integrate with a form builder program, the form-builder will need to create output in a format that the form-displaying program (angular formly) can understand.  Often, when this sort of thing is done, the pattern is to develop a contract (e.g. API, schema, etc.) that both applications / layers / etc. can depend on.  \nI propose that this contract should be a JSON Schema document, because then you could use an out of the box schema validator on either the client side (e.g. tv4) or the server side (e.g. a python / ruby package) to validate the \"form\" that has been built by the form builder.\n. Chiming in on the utility of my (currently closed) feature request. . .\nAngular-Formly takes in a JSON document (the Form Description Document or FDD) and uses it to render a form.  According to the documentation, validation is accomplished via a combination of Angular's built-in validation and the special validators object which contains validation functions.  Put differently, the \"schema\" for the data in a Formly form consists of the FDD, plus the built-in Angular validation directives, plus optionally the special validation functions in the \"validators\" object.\nChanging this so that the FDD is a JSON Schema document has at least two benefits:\n1. You  (the Formly maintainer(s)) can use other validators (like TV4) to do the validation and not write/maintain validation related code.\n2. The JSON Schema document becomes the single-source-of-truth on the schema for the data structure.  The end-user could use the schema to validate the data in other places (e.g. on the server) without having to have a separate schema which is kept in sync with the Formly FDD.\nThis is the underlying approach taken by Angular Schema Form.\n. No, I think thats a different thing than what k010 is asking about here. (But I've proposed it in another issue.) I apologize, in advance and in a continuing fashion, for sowing confusion.

I found it quite confusing when building input templates that use the same attribute name.\nLooking forward to the wrapper. Actually, I had issues in my current project where it was simpler to avoid using Formly in order to render the inputs on the page properly. I imagine the wrapper could even be used to create in-line styled forms, or even drop-down menus. I assume this will grant the ability to finally organize fields on the page by wrapping them in boxes with custom css classes. Great!\nmodelOptions & validators is a tough call.

I'll get prepared with e2e tests for the 3.0.0 drop to catch up to speed. Good luck with the talk next week!\n. Awesome, I'll try to have it all up-to-date by the end of the week.\n. Then I better get on that right away! \nI was working on making a simple grunt/gulp tool to compile formly templates to make future updates smoother, but I think I'll just stick to using ng-templates + copy/paste. Ran into a frustrating lack of know-how. If you have an existing solution, let me know!\n. Already loving the wrappers. \nBut I'm a little confused about the API. So templateOptions refers to template specific parameters. That's clearly needed. At first I thought required belonged outside of templateOptions, but now I realize it's in the right place. \nHowever, I don't understand why options: [] is under templateOptions. Is it not the basic data options i.e. for radio buttons? \n. As a suggestion, perhaps options.templateOptions.someName could be shortened to templateOptions.someName (with some difficulty) or options.template.someName?\n. Another crazier suggestion, as it's getting late on this side of the world:\nA lot of templateOptions can be linked to core angular directives: ng-required, ng-disabled, ng-checked, etc. Perhaps these could be differentiated if deemed necessary? On second thought, maybe not.\n. Typo in CHANGELOG 3.0.0 (Unpublished)\nmode[options.key] - > model\n. I see what you mean now about options: [] & templateOptions and I'm happy with that part of the API.\n. I fixed up the angular-formly-templates-lumx. There's a demo here.\nI haven't been able to get any selecters to work with 3.0.0, any thoughts? I'll try again later.\n. 99% working. Thanks for the help!\n. The pre/post wrapper can have definite uses. I'll put some thought into it.\nHowever, what about changes in context? These should be handled in the JSON for easier usability rather than at the provider level.\nI quickly googled \"grid form\" for an example. Formly + any css framework should be able to create complex form grids. \nI was thinking adding an optional wrapperOptions to the api could handle all of this. It would perform in essentially the same way as templateOptions.\n. I just realized formlyConfigProvider.setWrapper({}) forces all of the wrappers on the template. As a result I was getting 3 sets of ngMessages on my text-fields, one for each wrapper. I'm not sure the usefulness of setWrapper other than saving a little template code.\n. I see now that wrapperOptions are not needed.  templateOptions can already fill them out. Excellent! Issue closed for me.\n. I posted up some examples with docs on the templates-lumx site, have a look and tell me what you think. So far, I'm loving the flexibility wrappers bring. Thanks!\n. One of the new features is using flexbox with form fields. :)\n. Sorry, I just checked my email and found I had completely missed that previous message! FYI - I'm in the South Korea time zone (UTC+09:00).\nSo far, I think one pipeline is fine. I'll look into the template manipulator ASAP.\n. I hadn't realized the power of ngModelAttrs. They can drastically reduce the bloat on form fields.\nI think the docs could use an example. I'm not entirely sure how to use them. \nAre they set by an ngModelAttrs array that can hold multiple ng-directives with values? \nngModelAttrs = ['ng-required': true, 'ng-pattern': '/[A-Za-z]/', 'ng-disabled': false]\nOr can they only be set and changed in expressionProperties?\nexpressionProperties: {\n    options.ngModelAttrs[ng-required] = true,\n    options.ngModelAttrs[ng-pattern] = /[A-Za-z]/\n    options.ngModelAttrs[ng-disabled] = false\n    }\n. I'm trying to setup flex-box with angular-formly-templates-lumx. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it to work based on this jsbin example.\nError: `Formly Error: You have specified field properties that are not allowed: \"fields\"`.\nQuestions\n\nHow could I add a custom field fields: [] to my template?\nIs it possible to define and add other custom fields?

That's the one. I'll take a look at it again tomorrow. Also time for a break. Take care of yourself!\nAgain, I appreciate the help.\n. Working. It's a beautiful thing. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Once I get a full understanding of angular-formly, I'll start contributing the jsbin docs as well.\n. I think wrappers have a lot of great benefits. They don't necessarily need their own formlyConfig.setWrapper when formlyConfig.setType basically does the same thing. \nBut I am a big fan of the functionality of wrappers.\n. I found a way to do this today using flex-box. There's an example here.\nThe trick is to create a type with another <formly-form> inside of it.\n<div>\n    <formly-form fields=\"options.templateOptions.fields\"\n                 model=\"$parent.model\" form=\"::id\" root-el=\"div\"\n                 flex-container=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.container}}\"\n                 flex-align=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.align}}\"\n                 flex-gutter=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.gutter}}\">\n    </formly-form>\n</div>\nYou don't need all of those attributes, but notice the model links to the $parent.model and the fields link to options.templateOptions.fields. In other words, fields sit inside of templateOptions.\nStyles can then be applied using a wrapper.\n<div ng-class=\"'{{::options.templateOptions.flex.className}}'\"\n    flex-item=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.item}}\"\n    flex-order=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.order}}\">\n    <formly-transclude></formly-transclude>\n</div>\nThe end result produces fields that looks like this:\n{\n  'key': 'modelName',\n  'type': 'lx-wrapper-flex',\n  'templateOptions': {\n    'container': 'row', // row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse\n    'wrap': 'nowrap', // nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse\n    'align': 'space-between', // flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | stretch\n    'className': 'bgc-red-500', // ng-class\n    'style': 'height: 200px'\n     'fields': [{\n        {\n          'key': 'modelName',\n          'type': 'lx-whatever-type'\n          'wrapper': 'lx-wrapper-flex-item', // <- add the wrapper\n          'templateOptions': {\n            'flex': {\n              'item': '1' // flex-value number, higher weights the space ratio more \n              'order': '1', // value for ordering boxes\n              'className': 'bgc-red-500' // ng-class\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }]\n  },\n}\nIf you have any questions, shoot me an email (me@shmck.com).\n. This could be achieved now by just manipulating classes. However, I totally agree, the current system is for achieving a form grid is kind of a hack and could be improved.\nThe outer field could use a grid type with an ng-class, in this case it'll take row.\n<div>\n<formly-form fields=\"options.templateOptions.fields\" model=\"$parent.model\"\nng-class=\"options.templateOptions.className\"></formly-form>\n</div>\nYour inner fields could be wrapped with, let's say wrapper-div for lack of a better name. It also needs an ng-class, they'll take a col-md-6 in our example.\n<div ng-class=\"options.templateOptions.div.className\">\n    <formly-transclude></formly-transclude>\n</div>\nThen your fields would go inside the grid type.\n$scope.formFields = [\n    {\n        key: userGrid,\n        type: grid,\n        templateOptions: {\n                        className: 'row'\n            fields: [{\n                key: 'username',\n                type: 'text',\n                                wrapper: 'wrapper-div'\n                templateOptions: {\n                    div: {\n                        className: 'col-md-6'\n                    },\n                    label: 'Username',\n                    placeholder: 'johndoe',\n                    required: true,\n                    disabled: false, //default: false\n                    description: 'Descriptive text'\n                }, {\n                key: 'password',\n                type: 'password',\n                               wrapper: 'wrapper-div',\n                templateOptions: {\n                    div: {\n                        className: 'col-md-6'\n                    },\n                    label: 'Password',\n                    required: true,\n                    disabled: false, //default: false\n                    expressionProperties: {\n                        hide: '!model.username' // hide when username is blank\n                    }\n                }\n            }]\n        }\n    }];\nThat twisted Christmas tree doesn't look pretty, but it may work. Thanks to @kentcdodds for helping figure that pattern out earlier.\n. :+1: Fantastic!\n. Any specs on the logo?\n- Is it for Angular-Formly in particular or Formly-JS entirely?\n. Somehow I hadn't noticed the link, the error/warning docs are great. Issue should be resolved!\n. However, if I set noFormControl to true on lx-flex, it will remove the needed formControl on all inner elements. May need some kind of grid based fix.\n. I would consider it a grid issue. The solution worked for titles.\n. I like the idea. Lately, I've been playing with React and enjoy their implementation of type validation. It follows as properties on a validation object that can follow a hierarchical order. An (http://developer.fortnox.se/blog/proptypes-in-react-js/)[http://developer.fortnox.se/blog/proptypes-in-react-js/].\njavascript\ntemplateOptions: {\n   required: Formly.optionsType.boolean,\n   maxlength: Formly.optionsType.number.range(4, 8),\n   type: Formly.optionsType.oneOf('text', 'number', 'url', 'email', 'password').default('text').isRequired\n}\nIt could also be written as an object, as in the react-prop-schema library. Now that I look at it, this method is much more in order with what angular-formly is doing already.\njavascript\n{\n  \"required\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"},\n  \"maxlength\": {\"type\": \"number\", \n                       \"min\": 4, \"max\": 8},\n  \"type\": {\"oneOf\": [\"text\", \"number\", \"url\", \"email\", \"password\"], \n               \"required\": true, \n               \"default\": \"text\" }\n}\n. These could be added in the setType stage when creating a template. It would be easy to add:\njavascript\nformlyConfigProvider.setType({\n    name: name,\n    templateUrl: templateUrl,\n    optionTypes: optionTypes  /** optionSchema? */\n})\n. I should keep a better eye on your prolific Github work. There are definitely a lot of great ideas that can be exchanged between React & Angular, great work with apiCheck.js!\n. After reading the intro docs, I'm quite happy with apicheck.js. Let me know when it's ready and I'll give it a beta run.\n. Is there an option available for using apiCheck with formlyConfigProvider.setType ?\n. I think the API could be further simplified, but the functionality is great and necessary.\nIdeas: \n- Smart defaults: like templateOptionsCheck.strict set to true.\n- I think the validation should try to resemble the current json-like style api as much as possible.\n- Will errors be thrown or logged as warnings? I have a personal preference for warnings.\nA few questions about the example:\nIn the example, validateOptions takes a function with options but doesn't use the parameter.\nI'm also not sure what the placeholder: apicheck does.\n. I have to say, it sounds great. If you can post a few good working examples, I'll set it up with LumX and give it a try.\n. :)\n. I figured a way around it. Before I handled setType in the config stage, but with 3.3 it results in an error.\nI changed it to handle wrappers in config and types in run, then no problem.\n. I map over the templates to create them. \njavascript\nFor example: FIELDS = [{ \n    name: 'templateName', \n    template: 'htmlStuffHere'\n}]\nWill it be possible to map over the apiCheck validation rules with the new 3.3 API?\nExample:\njavascript\n FIELDS.map(function (field) {\n        formlyConfig.setType({\n          name: _prefixer(field.name),\n          templateUrl: _fieldTemplateUrl(field.name),\n          validateOptions: function (options) {\n            apiCheck.throw(field.validateOptions || apiCheck.object, arguments);  // <--- validateOptions key\n          }\n        });\n      });\nI imagine field.validateOptions would be a function or object... But not sure how to set this up. Perhaps some more advanced examples?\n. So far I'm still not quite sure how to use validateOptions as an object in a loop.\njavascript\n\"validateOptions\": function (options, apiCheck) {\n      apiCheck.warn([\n        apiCheck.shape({\n         templateOptions: {\n                   label: apiCheck.string\n                }\n          })\n      ], arguments);\n    }\n}\nOf course, this doesn't work. \nWould it be possible to pass in an object that automatically used apiCheck.shape on templateOptions with easy defaults?\njavascript\n\"validateOptions\": {\n    label: apiCheck.string\n}\n. Actually, ideally it would great if apiCheck could be used with angular-formly in a more succinct manner:\nsetType:\nvalidateOptions: apiCheck(field.validateOptions)\nFields object:\njavascript\nvalidateOptions: {\n      label: 'string',\n      required: 'boolean'\n}\nForgive me! This is me dreaming of an impractical perfect world after my own failure at applying apiCheck! \n. Could we get a more advanced example of using apiCheck with angular-formly? I think that would help. \n// formlyConfig.setType\nvalidateOptions: function (options) {\n            apiCheck.warn([\n              apiCheck.shape({\n                label: apiCheck.string\n              })], arguments);\n          }\nResults in an error: \nangular-formly: apiCheck failed! You passed: {\"key\":\"String\",\"type\":\"String\",\"templateOptions\":\"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"String\\\",\\\"label\\\":\\\"String\\\"}\",\"data\":\"{}\",\"validation\":\"{}\"} and should have passed: `shape({\"label\":\"String\"})``\nI've struggled and failed at getting a basic example to work.\n. Thanks, I'll give it a try!\n. No longer an issue, closed!\n. I tried JSPM with the minified version. Different error this time:\nUncaught TypeError: n(...) is not a function\n. You're right, there are no references to webpack loaded from minified version. When I remove the reference to sourcemaps in formly.min.js, the problem persists as well.\nIs there a version of formly that doesn't rely on webpack module loading? \nI prefer JSPM as it is just a simple extension of NPM & Bower, tools most people are already familiar with. The learning curve is minutes. \nPerhaps the issue is JSPM providing better webpack support...\n. Significant step forward. Angular-formly@4.0.6 loads, but then, sadly, crashes on api-check@6.0.10.\nFailed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. \nError loading \"bower:api-check@6.0.10\"\nI'm not sure why it fails to load as all paths look fine.\nThe server fails with: \nError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\n    at errnoException (dns.js:37:11)\n    at Object.onanswer [as oncomplete] (dns.js:124:16)\n. It's strange, all the paths are fine but the es6-module-loader gives a DSN error.\nI'll try updating the es6-module-loader & traceur to see if a fix has been incorporated. \nI would really like to use angular-formly on this new project!\n. I think it's fair to assume its a bigger JSPM or ES6ModuleLoader issue, as it works fine with NPM. Not library specific.\n. Unfortunately, transferring fails with \"You don't have admin rights to formly-js\".\nOption A is to (temporarily) change group permissions to grant me admin rights for the repo.

Another crazier suggestion, as it's getting late on this side of the world:\nA lot of templateOptions can be linked to core angular directives: ng-required, ng-disabled, ng-checked, etc. Perhaps these could be differentiated if deemed necessary? On second thought, maybe not.\n. Typo in CHANGELOG 3.0.0 (Unpublished)\nmode[options.key] - > model\n. I see what you mean now about options: [] & templateOptions and I'm happy with that part of the API.\n. I fixed up the angular-formly-templates-lumx. There's a demo here.\nI haven't been able to get any selecters to work with 3.0.0, any thoughts? I'll try again later.\n. 99% working. Thanks for the help!\n. The pre/post wrapper can have definite uses. I'll put some thought into it.\nHowever, what about changes in context? These should be handled in the JSON for easier usability rather than at the provider level.\nI quickly googled \"grid form\" for an example. Formly + any css framework should be able to create complex form grids. \nI was thinking adding an optional wrapperOptions to the api could handle all of this. It would perform in essentially the same way as templateOptions.\n. I just realized formlyConfigProvider.setWrapper({}) forces all of the wrappers on the template. As a result I was getting 3 sets of ngMessages on my text-fields, one for each wrapper. I'm not sure the usefulness of setWrapper other than saving a little template code.\n. I see now that wrapperOptions are not needed.  templateOptions can already fill them out. Excellent! Issue closed for me.\n. I posted up some examples with docs on the templates-lumx site, have a look and tell me what you think. So far, I'm loving the flexibility wrappers bring. Thanks!\n. One of the new features is using flexbox with form fields. :)\n. Sorry, I just checked my email and found I had completely missed that previous message! FYI - I'm in the South Korea time zone (UTC+09:00).\nSo far, I think one pipeline is fine. I'll look into the template manipulator ASAP.\n. I hadn't realized the power of ngModelAttrs. They can drastically reduce the bloat on form fields.\nI think the docs could use an example. I'm not entirely sure how to use them. \nAre they set by an ngModelAttrs array that can hold multiple ng-directives with values? \nngModelAttrs = ['ng-required': true, 'ng-pattern': '/[A-Za-z]/', 'ng-disabled': false]\nOr can they only be set and changed in expressionProperties?\nexpressionProperties: {\n    options.ngModelAttrs[ng-required] = true,\n    options.ngModelAttrs[ng-pattern] = /[A-Za-z]/\n    options.ngModelAttrs[ng-disabled] = false\n    }\n. I'm trying to setup flex-box with angular-formly-templates-lumx. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it to work based on this jsbin example.\nError: `Formly Error: You have specified field properties that are not allowed: \"fields\"`.\nQuestions\n\nHow could I add a custom field fields: [] to my template?\nIs it possible to define and add other custom fields?

Good idea, bad idea?\n``` html\n lx-wrapper-flex-container \n\n\n\n``\n. Binding the inner form tomodel[options.key].fields` may mess up the form data. But should work.\n.

That's the one. I'll take a look at it again tomorrow. Also time for a break. Take care of yourself!\nAgain, I appreciate the help.\n. Working. It's a beautiful thing. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Once I get a full understanding of angular-formly, I'll start contributing the jsbin docs as well.\n. I think wrappers have a lot of great benefits. They don't necessarily need their own formlyConfig.setWrapper when formlyConfig.setType basically does the same thing. \nBut I am a big fan of the functionality of wrappers.\n. I found a way to do this today using flex-box. There's an example here.\nThe trick is to create a type with another <formly-form> inside of it.\n<div>\n    <formly-form fields=\"options.templateOptions.fields\"\n                 model=\"$parent.model\" form=\"::id\" root-el=\"div\"\n                 flex-container=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.container}}\"\n                 flex-align=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.align}}\"\n                 flex-gutter=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.gutter}}\">\n    </formly-form>\n</div>\nYou don't need all of those attributes, but notice the model links to the $parent.model and the fields link to options.templateOptions.fields. In other words, fields sit inside of templateOptions.\nStyles can then be applied using a wrapper.\n<div ng-class=\"'{{::options.templateOptions.flex.className}}'\"\n    flex-item=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.item}}\"\n    flex-order=\"{{::options.templateOptions.flex.order}}\">\n    <formly-transclude></formly-transclude>\n</div>\nThe end result produces fields that looks like this:\n{\n  'key': 'modelName',\n  'type': 'lx-wrapper-flex',\n  'templateOptions': {\n    'container': 'row', // row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse\n    'wrap': 'nowrap', // nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse\n    'align': 'space-between', // flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | stretch\n    'className': 'bgc-red-500', // ng-class\n    'style': 'height: 200px'\n     'fields': [{\n        {\n          'key': 'modelName',\n          'type': 'lx-whatever-type'\n          'wrapper': 'lx-wrapper-flex-item', // <- add the wrapper\n          'templateOptions': {\n            'flex': {\n              'item': '1' // flex-value number, higher weights the space ratio more \n              'order': '1', // value for ordering boxes\n              'className': 'bgc-red-500' // ng-class\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }]\n  },\n}\nIf you have any questions, shoot me an email (me@shmck.com).\n. This could be achieved now by just manipulating classes. However, I totally agree, the current system is for achieving a form grid is kind of a hack and could be improved.\nThe outer field could use a grid type with an ng-class, in this case it'll take row.\n<div>\n<formly-form fields=\"options.templateOptions.fields\" model=\"$parent.model\"\nng-class=\"options.templateOptions.className\"></formly-form>\n</div>\nYour inner fields could be wrapped with, let's say wrapper-div for lack of a better name. It also needs an ng-class, they'll take a col-md-6 in our example.\n<div ng-class=\"options.templateOptions.div.className\">\n    <formly-transclude></formly-transclude>\n</div>\nThen your fields would go inside the grid type.\n$scope.formFields = [\n    {\n        key: userGrid,\n        type: grid,\n        templateOptions: {\n                        className: 'row'\n            fields: [{\n                key: 'username',\n                type: 'text',\n                                wrapper: 'wrapper-div'\n                templateOptions: {\n                    div: {\n                        className: 'col-md-6'\n                    },\n                    label: 'Username',\n                    placeholder: 'johndoe',\n                    required: true,\n                    disabled: false, //default: false\n                    description: 'Descriptive text'\n                }, {\n                key: 'password',\n                type: 'password',\n                               wrapper: 'wrapper-div',\n                templateOptions: {\n                    div: {\n                        className: 'col-md-6'\n                    },\n                    label: 'Password',\n                    required: true,\n                    disabled: false, //default: false\n                    expressionProperties: {\n                        hide: '!model.username' // hide when username is blank\n                    }\n                }\n            }]\n        }\n    }];\nThat twisted Christmas tree doesn't look pretty, but it may work. Thanks to @kentcdodds for helping figure that pattern out earlier.\n. :+1: Fantastic!\n. Any specs on the logo?\n- Is it for Angular-Formly in particular or Formly-JS entirely?\n. Somehow I hadn't noticed the link, the error/warning docs are great. Issue should be resolved!\n. However, if I set noFormControl to true on lx-flex, it will remove the needed formControl on all inner elements. May need some kind of grid based fix.\n. I would consider it a grid issue. The solution worked for titles.\n. I like the idea. Lately, I've been playing with React and enjoy their implementation of type validation. It follows as properties on a validation object that can follow a hierarchical order. An (http://developer.fortnox.se/blog/proptypes-in-react-js/)[http://developer.fortnox.se/blog/proptypes-in-react-js/].\njavascript\ntemplateOptions: {\n   required: Formly.optionsType.boolean,\n   maxlength: Formly.optionsType.number.range(4, 8),\n   type: Formly.optionsType.oneOf('text', 'number', 'url', 'email', 'password').default('text').isRequired\n}\nIt could also be written as an object, as in the react-prop-schema library. Now that I look at it, this method is much more in order with what angular-formly is doing already.\njavascript\n{\n  \"required\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"},\n  \"maxlength\": {\"type\": \"number\", \n                       \"min\": 4, \"max\": 8},\n  \"type\": {\"oneOf\": [\"text\", \"number\", \"url\", \"email\", \"password\"], \n               \"required\": true, \n               \"default\": \"text\" }\n}\n. These could be added in the setType stage when creating a template. It would be easy to add:\njavascript\nformlyConfigProvider.setType({\n    name: name,\n    templateUrl: templateUrl,\n    optionTypes: optionTypes  /** optionSchema? */\n})\n. I should keep a better eye on your prolific Github work. There are definitely a lot of great ideas that can be exchanged between React & Angular, great work with apiCheck.js!\n. After reading the intro docs, I'm quite happy with apicheck.js. Let me know when it's ready and I'll give it a beta run.\n. Is there an option available for using apiCheck with formlyConfigProvider.setType ?\n. I think the API could be further simplified, but the functionality is great and necessary.\nIdeas: \n- Smart defaults: like templateOptionsCheck.strict set to true.\n- I think the validation should try to resemble the current json-like style api as much as possible.\n- Will errors be thrown or logged as warnings? I have a personal preference for warnings.\nA few questions about the example:\nIn the example, validateOptions takes a function with options but doesn't use the parameter.\nI'm also not sure what the placeholder: apicheck does.\n. I have to say, it sounds great. If you can post a few good working examples, I'll set it up with LumX and give it a try.\n. :)\n. I figured a way around it. Before I handled setType in the config stage, but with 3.3 it results in an error.\nI changed it to handle wrappers in config and types in run, then no problem.\n. I map over the templates to create them. \njavascript\nFor example: FIELDS = [{ \n    name: 'templateName', \n    template: 'htmlStuffHere'\n}]\nWill it be possible to map over the apiCheck validation rules with the new 3.3 API?\nExample:\njavascript\n FIELDS.map(function (field) {\n        formlyConfig.setType({\n          name: _prefixer(field.name),\n          templateUrl: _fieldTemplateUrl(field.name),\n          validateOptions: function (options) {\n            apiCheck.throw(field.validateOptions || apiCheck.object, arguments);  // <--- validateOptions key\n          }\n        });\n      });\nI imagine field.validateOptions would be a function or object... But not sure how to set this up. Perhaps some more advanced examples?\n. So far I'm still not quite sure how to use validateOptions as an object in a loop.\njavascript\n\"validateOptions\": function (options, apiCheck) {\n      apiCheck.warn([\n        apiCheck.shape({\n         templateOptions: {\n                   label: apiCheck.string\n                }\n          })\n      ], arguments);\n    }\n}\nOf course, this doesn't work. \nWould it be possible to pass in an object that automatically used apiCheck.shape on templateOptions with easy defaults?\njavascript\n\"validateOptions\": {\n    label: apiCheck.string\n}\n. Actually, ideally it would great if apiCheck could be used with angular-formly in a more succinct manner:\nsetType:\nvalidateOptions: apiCheck(field.validateOptions)\nFields object:\njavascript\nvalidateOptions: {\n      label: 'string',\n      required: 'boolean'\n}\nForgive me! This is me dreaming of an impractical perfect world after my own failure at applying apiCheck! \n. Could we get a more advanced example of using apiCheck with angular-formly? I think that would help. \n// formlyConfig.setType\nvalidateOptions: function (options) {\n            apiCheck.warn([\n              apiCheck.shape({\n                label: apiCheck.string\n              })], arguments);\n          }\nResults in an error: \nangular-formly: apiCheck failed! You passed: {\"key\":\"String\",\"type\":\"String\",\"templateOptions\":\"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"String\\\",\\\"label\\\":\\\"String\\\"}\",\"data\":\"{}\",\"validation\":\"{}\"} and should have passed: `shape({\"label\":\"String\"})``\nI've struggled and failed at getting a basic example to work.\n. Thanks, I'll give it a try!\n. No longer an issue, closed!\n. I tried JSPM with the minified version. Different error this time:\nUncaught TypeError: n(...) is not a function\n. You're right, there are no references to webpack loaded from minified version. When I remove the reference to sourcemaps in formly.min.js, the problem persists as well.\nIs there a version of formly that doesn't rely on webpack module loading? \nI prefer JSPM as it is just a simple extension of NPM & Bower, tools most people are already familiar with. The learning curve is minutes. \nPerhaps the issue is JSPM providing better webpack support...\n. Significant step forward. Angular-formly@4.0.6 loads, but then, sadly, crashes on api-check@6.0.10.\nFailed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. \nError loading \"bower:api-check@6.0.10\"\nI'm not sure why it fails to load as all paths look fine.\nThe server fails with: \nError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\n    at errnoException (dns.js:37:11)\n    at Object.onanswer [as oncomplete] (dns.js:124:16)\n. It's strange, all the paths are fine but the es6-module-loader gives a DSN error.\nI'll try updating the es6-module-loader & traceur to see if a fix has been incorporated. \nI would really like to use angular-formly on this new project!\n. I think it's fair to assume its a bigger JSPM or ES6ModuleLoader issue, as it works fine with NPM. Not library specific.\n. ",

I wouldn't know the formfields as its dynamically generated. Can you provide inputs around that.\n. i was already doing that.. but there is a typo which was causing issue .. now working fine ...\nI am just concerned on the performance by storing the formdata and formfields .. for every operation... wouldn't it nice if we could just destroy the earlier data and update with the new data .. \ni really appreciate your help and inputs ...\n.

    "gboersma": "I like the fact that formly can now catch errors in setting the options. However, for my app, I generate the options dynamically from the server (Java), which maps the JSON objects to / from Java classes. So I either have to rejig the Java implementation, or write some Javascript to munge the JSON into the correct format. Either one is not very pretty. Since the JSON is generated automatically from Java classes, I am not really that concerned about template options getting mixed up with formly options, since I control the naming on both sides (JSON and field templates).\nWould it be possible to provide an option to leave it as is? One way to implement it is, if the option is set, to have formly create the templateOptions object automatically by moving properties that are not options from the options map into the templateOptions map. It can be done right before calling each of the form fields, so the core formly call should not have to change. I could take a stab at this, but my JavaScript Fu is probably not up to it at this point.\n. I can live with this. Another option that I may be able to go with is to write a custom Jackson serializer / deserializer on the Java server-side, which will convert the JSON structure to the Java object structure and vice-versa. This will make things more robust for any future naming / structure changes on the JSON.\n. I think the custom controller and link example is what I am looking for. But it is still not clear to me how I can declare my own controller somewhere, and then pass it in (as opposed to declaring methods directly within the setType call). So let's say I declare a module called 'forms' and set the templates there. Can I define a controller for this module and then pass it in when a call setType? Or define a new controller locally within the module and then pass it in through setType?\nSorry if some of this is basic angularJS. Still trying to understand how to fit all the pieces together.\n. That worked like a charm. Thanks so much!\n. I think I got it. I created a run method for my module and passed in $http and $templateCache. I then load each of the templates into the cache:\n$http.get('path/to/template.html', {cache:$templateCache});\nI guess I could also have each template loaded directly from a string (i.e. from a build system plugin, I'm guessing) and completely avoid the server round-trip, but this is good enough for me.\n.

Here is the code snippet:\n```\n                function setupWithParsers(validator, name, isAsync) {\n                    var inFlightValidator = void 0;\n                    ctrl.$parsers.unshift(function evalValidityOfParser(viewValue) {\n                        var isValid = nxnpjsonUtils.formlyEval(scope, validator, ctrl.$modelValue, viewValue);\n                        if (isAsync) {\n                            ctrl.$pending = ctrl.$pending || {};\n                            ctrl.$pending[name] = true;\n                            inFlightValidator = isValid;\n                            isValid.then(function () {\n                                if (inFlightValidator === isValid) {\n                                    ctrl.$setValidity(name, true);\n                                }\n                            }).catch(function () {\n                                if (inFlightValidator === isValid) {\n                                    ctrl.$setValidity(name, false);\n                                }\n                            }).finally(function () {\n                                var $pending = ctrl.$pending || {};\n                                if (Object.keys($pending).length === 1) {\n                                    delete ctrl.$pending;\n                                } else {\n                                    delete ctrl.$pending[name];\n                                }\n                            });\n                        } else {\n                            ctrl.$setValidity(name, isValid);\n                        }\n                        return viewValue;\n                    });\n                if(!ctrl.$validate) {\n                    // EG: I polyfill the $validate function so thate validateOnModelChange works\n                    // why do we need to use 1.2.x :(\n                    ctrl.$validate = function () {\n                        angular.forEach(ctrl.$parsers, function (parser) {\n                            var getType = {},\n                                isFunction = parser && getType.toString.call(parser) === '[object Function]';\n                            if (isFunction) {\n                                parser();\n                            }\n                        })\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n```\nThis works for one validator. I will need to implement a reduce for it to work with multiple and do some extra logic, most likely. I also need to check if the return needs to be adjusted (since right now I'm relying on the parser function internally setting the valid state and not caring about what I am returning from this function.) However my npm install isnt working and my POC with the later version of angular is broken until I can get that back and working. Will update you.\nThanks for having done some ground work on this!. >I might not fully understand here, but if you didn't require the form controller, isn't formly just a templating library at that point? I'm not sure there's that many strong use cases that don't require a form controller (though I'm probably wrong on that).\nit's actually a fairly common use-case to inter-mix forms and interactive, templated components. \nCan I ask what issues came about which caused this?

I still wouldn't think it's appropriate for fieldTransforms but that's just me. How about an injectable service that can do the mutation and wrap your calls? That way if in any case you do not not require the mutation it is trivial not to have it.. That doesn't sound like an issue. I also created a form mutator for my project and believe it's a superior approach from an architecture perspective as this can scale to scenarios where a global configuration object would make it more difficult to use straight formly forms with no mutation applied. . Hi, this is angular 1 formly. Please see: https://github.com/formly-js/ng-formly. I think I saw functionality in formly source code to turn off the default handling for ng-model. You could possibly implement your own model watching & update the formy model when KendoUI model changes in a custom type http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/model#events-change. This is a common software application pattern so I would recommend to create a jsbin / library for it and we can add it on the website either as an example or feature it on the integrations section.\nThis is as close to official as you'll get :).

Of course you will have to expose the fields somehow to this module, rather then render all the fields straight away.\nI hope that was clear, I'm finishing a project by thursday but maybe after that I can help you building this part of the bridge. btw nice talk on NG-NL.\n.

    "pmowrer": "Sorry to come back so quickly, but I ran into this immediately. To follow up where this was left off, unreachable-branch-transform would probably work. But, an even easier way is likely to include angular-formly in Browserify's noParse option since we can safely assume that angular-formly is a self-contained bundle. This way it won't be parsed for requires.\nThat worked. Unfortunately, Browserify still got stuck generating source maps with the following error:\nError: Invalid mapping: {\"generated\":{\"line\":9079,\"column\":7},\"source\":\"webpack:///webpack/universalModuleDefinition\",\"original\":{},\"name\":null}\n  at SourceMapGenerator_validateMapping [as _validateMapping] ([...]node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-pack/node_modules/combine-source-map/node_modules/inline-source-map/node_modules/source-map/lib/source-map/source-map-generator.js:275:15)\nHaven't had time to dig into that yet, but disabling Browserify's source maps (debug: false) allows the bundling to complete successfully.\nTrying to load angular-formly into our Angular app revealed the next problem. Since angular-formly wasn't parsed (noParse), it needs some help getting its dependencies: angular and api-check. We can do that using Browserify's require option. E.g. something like:\nbrowserify.require(require.resolve('api-check'), { expose: 'api-check' });\n    browserify.require(require.resolve('angular'), { expose: 'angular' });\nThat was enough to get it working in our environment! We'd of course want to turn our source maps back on, but I would imagine it's not an insurmountable problem to solve.\n. @kentcdodds So I'm back to have another look at formly + browserify. The 6.x upgrade to es6 modules solves the original problem! However, the source map problem is still happening when Browserify source maps are enabled (debug=true). Browserify internally uses https://github.com/thlorenz/combine-source-map to merge source maps from all bundled sources, which in turn uses https://github.com/mozilla/source-map, the eventual source of the error. I'm far from certain what the problem is or who's \"responsible\".\nDecoding the inlined sourcemap, you get:\njson\n{\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"webpack:///webpack/universalModuleDefinition\",\"webpack:///webpack/bootstrap 0853238e408d60f0f324\",\"webpack:///./index.js\",...\nI'm no source map wiz, but the source URIs, webpack:///..., look like they're maybe specific to the webpack dev environment? \nRemoving the inline source map from the mains, i.e. angular-formly/dist/formly.js and api-check/dist/api-check.js respectively, predictably solves the problem.\nIt makes me wonder, is bundling source maps with unminified source like angular-formly and api-check is doing typical? Looking through some other libraries (including angular itself), I can only see source maps being bundled with minified source (external). Is there a good reason why formly should inline source maps in unminified production builds?\n. Pointing to the minified version isn't super straightforward since Browserify works off of main in the package.json. It can be shimmed using browserify-shim to point to the minified file, which works, but api-check.js also needs to be shimmed. Since api-check.js is an internal dependency of formly.js, its not easily shimmed (or maybe it is if applied globally).\nI found it easier to write a Browserify transform to strip the source maps from formly.js and api-check.js. Added bonus of not having to use the minified source. Here it is in case someone else finds it useful as a temporary workaround (must be applied globally. lone dependency is through2):\n``` javascript\nfunction(file) {\n    var data = '';\nif (!/((angular-formly)|(api-check))\\/dist\\/((formly)|(api-check)).js$/.test(file)) {\n  return through();\n}\n\nreturn through(write, end);\n\nfunction write(chunk, enc, callback) {\n  data += chunk;\n  callback();\n}\n\nfunction end(callback) {\n  data = data.replace(/\\/\\/# sourceMappingURL.*/, '');\n  this.push(data);\n  callback();\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @kentcdodds Verified on our end that it works! Nicely done :)\n. Wow, thanks for the extremely quick fix @kentcdodds! Verified it works on our end as well.\n. Like @jvandemo's said, based on his debugging it looks like significant time is spent intrasncludeInWrappers. Drilling into that method, it looks like theforEachon thewrapper` array is the reason that the method is expensive, all of which appears to be validation/apiCheck? \njavascript\n          formlyUsability.checkWrapper(wrapper, options);\n          wrapper.validateOptions && wrapper.validateOptions(options);\n          runApiCheck(wrapper, options);\nIts helpful to have better errors, but probably too expensive to run in a production environment, especially when every bit of performance improvement matters. @kentcdodds, is there an easy way to turn off apiCheck? There's a hint in the docs that alludes to the possibility, but I couldn't find an option.\n. Beat me to it! Works perfectly for our purposes. Thanks!\n.

Unfortunately, Browserify still got stuck generating source maps with the following error:\nError: Invalid mapping: {\"generated\":{\"line\":9079,\"column\":7},\"source\":\"webpack:///webpack/universalModuleDefinition\",\"original\":{},\"name\":null}\n  at SourceMapGenerator_validateMapping [as _validateMapping] ([...]node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-pack/node_modules/combine-source-map/node_modules/inline-source-map/node_modules/source-map/lib/source-map/source-map-generator.js:275:15)\nHaven't had time to dig into that yet, but disabling Browserify's source maps (debug: false) allows the bundling to complete successfully.\nTrying to load angular-formly into our Angular app revealed the next problem. Since angular-formly wasn't parsed (noParse), it needs some help getting its dependencies: angular and api-check. We can do that using Browserify's require option. E.g. something like:\nbrowserify.require(require.resolve('api-check'), { expose: 'api-check' });\n    browserify.require(require.resolve('angular'), { expose: 'angular' });\nThat was enough to get it working in our environment! We'd of course want to turn our source maps back on, but I would imagine it's not an insurmountable problem to solve.\n. @kentcdodds So I'm back to have another look at formly + browserify. The 6.x upgrade to es6 modules solves the original problem! However, the source map problem is still happening when Browserify source maps are enabled (debug=true). Browserify internally uses https://github.com/thlorenz/combine-source-map to merge source maps from all bundled sources, which in turn uses https://github.com/mozilla/source-map, the eventual source of the error. I'm far from certain what the problem is or who's \"responsible\".\nDecoding the inlined sourcemap, you get:\njson\n{\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"webpack:///webpack/universalModuleDefinition\",\"webpack:///webpack/bootstrap 0853238e408d60f0f324\",\"webpack:///./index.js\",...\nI'm no source map wiz, but the source URIs, webpack:///..., look like they're maybe specific to the webpack dev environment? \nRemoving the inline source map from the mains, i.e. angular-formly/dist/formly.js and api-check/dist/api-check.js respectively, predictably solves the problem.\nIt makes me wonder, is bundling source maps with unminified source like angular-formly and api-check is doing typical? Looking through some other libraries (including angular itself), I can only see source maps being bundled with minified source (external). Is there a good reason why formly should inline source maps in unminified production builds?\n. Pointing to the minified version isn't super straightforward since Browserify works off of main in the package.json. It can be shimmed using browserify-shim to point to the minified file, which works, but api-check.js also needs to be shimmed. Since api-check.js is an internal dependency of formly.js, its not easily shimmed (or maybe it is if applied globally).\nI found it easier to write a Browserify transform to strip the source maps from formly.js and api-check.js. Added bonus of not having to use the minified source. Here it is in case someone else finds it useful as a temporary workaround (must be applied globally. lone dependency is through2):\n``` javascript\nfunction(file) {\n    var data = '';\nif (!/((angular-formly)|(api-check))\\/dist\\/((formly)|(api-check)).js$/.test(file)) {\n  return through();\n}\n\nreturn through(write, end);\n\nfunction write(chunk, enc, callback) {\n  data += chunk;\n  callback();\n}\n\nfunction end(callback) {\n  data = data.replace(/\\/\\/# sourceMappingURL.*/, '');\n  this.push(data);\n  callback();\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @kentcdodds Verified on our end that it works! Nicely done :)\n. Wow, thanks for the extremely quick fix @kentcdodds! Verified it works on our end as well.\n. Like @jvandemo's said, based on his debugging it looks like significant time is spent intrasncludeInWrappers. Drilling into that method, it looks like theforEachon thewrapper` array is the reason that the method is expensive, all of which appears to be validation/apiCheck? \njavascript\n          formlyUsability.checkWrapper(wrapper, options);\n          wrapper.validateOptions && wrapper.validateOptions(options);\n          runApiCheck(wrapper, options);\nIts helpful to have better errors, but probably too expensive to run in a production environment, especially when every bit of performance improvement matters. @kentcdodds, is there an easy way to turn off apiCheck? There's a hint in the docs that alludes to the possibility, but I couldn't find an option.\n. Beat me to it! Works perfectly for our purposes. Thanks!\n. ",

    "a01fe": "Awesome, thanks! Feel free to use that as an example.\n. In this case, no.  I'd like to do an atomic server side update in onSubmit() that validates and updates.  Doing a server call in my validator function could lead to race conditions where the validator passes but the subsequent update in onSubmit() fails due to other transactions. So, I'd still need to handle the possibility of server validation failures in my onSubmit().\nI've come up with a way to get the server's message to show by setting the field's validators.messages.server to a function that returns the server's message.  It's not very DRY though as I'd have to do that on every field.  Is there a better way to do that?\n. No worries.  Something like a mailing list would be good for things like this that are more \"discussion\" and less \"issue\" :)\nSetting validation.messages.server on each field works for me. To make things more DRY, I've added a service that can add or modify options on all fields so in my controller I pass fields through that before assigning them to a property on scope.\n. The way I do it doesn't result in duplicate code.  I have a single controller that has this onSubmit function:\n``` Javascript\n    function traverseFields(fields, fn) {\n        angular.forEach(fields, function (field) {\n            fn(field);\n            if (field.fieldGroup != null) {\n                traverseFields(field.fieldGroup, fn);\n            }\n        });\n    }\nfc.onSubmit = function (model) {\n    fc.errors = { };\n    (isNew ? $http.post(apiPath, model) : $http.put(apiPath, model))\n    .success(function (data, status, headers, config) {\n        dirtyExitCheckService.disable();\n        $state.go(isNew ? '^.^' : '^.show', null, { reload: true });\n    })\n    .error(function (data, status, headers, config) {\n        fc.errors = data || { errors: [{ message: 'Unknown error' }]};\n        angular.forEach(fc.errors.errors, function (error) {\n            error.isFieldError = false;\n            traverseFields(fc.fields, function (field) {\n                if (field.key != null && error.field === field.key) {\n                    error.isFieldError = true;\n                    field.formControl.$setValidity('server', false);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n```\nI have a service that adds server validation messages to the field definitions so I don't have to.\nJavascript\n    module.factory('fieldTransformerService', [function () {\n        var fieldTransformer = {\n            transform: function (model, fields) {\n                var newFields = [ ];\n                traverseFields(fields, function (field) {\n                    var newField = { };\n                    if (field.key != null) {\n                        $.extend(true, newField, {\n                            validation: {\n                                messages: {\n                                    server: function (viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n                                        var message = \"Unknown server error\";\n                                        angular.forEach(model.errors.errors, function (error) {\n                                            if (error.field === scope.options.key) {\n                                                message = error.message;\n                                            }\n                                        });\n                                        return message;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        });\n                    }\n                    $.extend(true, newField, field);\n                    newFields.push(newField);\n                });\n                return newFields;\n            }\n        };\n        return fieldTransformer;\n    }]);\nThen, to define fields, I do something like this:\nJavascript\nfc.fields = fieldTransformerService.transform(fc, [{\n    key: 'id',\n    type: 'input',\n    hide: true,\n    templateOptions: {\n        type: 'number'\n    }\n}, {\n    key: 'email',\n    type: 'input',\n    templateOptions: {\n        type: 'email',\n        label: 'Email',\n        required: true,\n        focus: true\n    }\n}, {\n    key: 'password',\n    type: 'input',\n    templateOptions: {\n        type: 'password',\n        label: 'Password',\n        requred: true\n    }\n}]);\n. I did this before you added the built-in fieldTransform.  It's on my to-do list to look at replacing my code with it, but I haven't gotten to it yet :)\n. I created a directive that resets the server error on any change:\nJavascript\n    module.directive('resetServerError', [function () {\n        return {\n            restrict: 'A',\n            require: '?ngModel',\n            link: function (scope, element, attrs, controller) {\n                element.on('input change', function () {\n                    scope.$apply(function () {\n                        controller.$setValidity('server', true);\n                    });\n                });\n            }\n        };\n    }]);\nand add the directive to input elements in my formly templates like so:\nhtml\n    <input class=\"form-control\" ng-model=\"model[options.key]\" reset-server-error>\n. I did it that way because I'm using my own templates.  You can use ngModelAttrsTemplateManipulator to add that directive to ngModel elements.  Just add ngModelAttrs in the same field transform you're adding the server validation stuff with.  That way you don't have to change the templates.\nhttp://docs.angular-formly.com/v7.2.3/docs/ngmodelattrstemplatemanipulator\n. I can see that setting up the watchers myself would be the most efficient solution, but it feels like I'm duplicating Formly code behind the API's back.  I think for the example, changing the ng-ifs to ng-show and ng-hide might be best.  I'm assuming that the issue you're referring to is that you'll have the overhead of the ng-models even when the form is in read only mode.\nFor my application, I think i'll take a different approach.  I have read only and editable versions of a form in two different ui router states, so my forms never change between read only and editable on the fly.  I now have a service that extends field objects by adding noFormControl: true when its in a read only state.\n. Nice, looks great!\n. Awesome, thanks! Feel free to use that as an example.\n. In this case, no.  I'd like to do an atomic server side update in onSubmit() that validates and updates.  Doing a server call in my validator function could lead to race conditions where the validator passes but the subsequent update in onSubmit() fails due to other transactions. So, I'd still need to handle the possibility of server validation failures in my onSubmit().\nI've come up with a way to get the server's message to show by setting the field's validators.messages.server to a function that returns the server's message.  It's not very DRY though as I'd have to do that on every field.  Is there a better way to do that?\n. No worries.  Something like a mailing list would be good for things like this that are more \"discussion\" and less \"issue\" :)\nSetting validation.messages.server on each field works for me. To make things more DRY, I've added a service that can add or modify options on all fields so in my controller I pass fields through that before assigning them to a property on scope.\n. The way I do it doesn't result in duplicate code.  I have a single controller that has this onSubmit function:\n``` Javascript\n    function traverseFields(fields, fn) {\n        angular.forEach(fields, function (field) {\n            fn(field);\n            if (field.fieldGroup != null) {\n                traverseFields(field.fieldGroup, fn);\n            }\n        });\n    }\nfc.onSubmit = function (model) {\n    fc.errors = { };\n    (isNew ? $http.post(apiPath, model) : $http.put(apiPath, model))\n    .success(function (data, status, headers, config) {\n        dirtyExitCheckService.disable();\n        $state.go(isNew ? '^.^' : '^.show', null, { reload: true });\n    })\n    .error(function (data, status, headers, config) {\n        fc.errors = data || { errors: [{ message: 'Unknown error' }]};\n        angular.forEach(fc.errors.errors, function (error) {\n            error.isFieldError = false;\n            traverseFields(fc.fields, function (field) {\n                if (field.key != null && error.field === field.key) {\n                    error.isFieldError = true;\n                    field.formControl.$setValidity('server', false);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n```\nI have a service that adds server validation messages to the field definitions so I don't have to.\nJavascript\n    module.factory('fieldTransformerService', [function () {\n        var fieldTransformer = {\n            transform: function (model, fields) {\n                var newFields = [ ];\n                traverseFields(fields, function (field) {\n                    var newField = { };\n                    if (field.key != null) {\n                        $.extend(true, newField, {\n                            validation: {\n                                messages: {\n                                    server: function (viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n                                        var message = \"Unknown server error\";\n                                        angular.forEach(model.errors.errors, function (error) {\n                                            if (error.field === scope.options.key) {\n                                                message = error.message;\n                                            }\n                                        });\n                                        return message;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        });\n                    }\n                    $.extend(true, newField, field);\n                    newFields.push(newField);\n                });\n                return newFields;\n            }\n        };\n        return fieldTransformer;\n    }]);\nThen, to define fields, I do something like this:\nJavascript\nfc.fields = fieldTransformerService.transform(fc, [{\n    key: 'id',\n    type: 'input',\n    hide: true,\n    templateOptions: {\n        type: 'number'\n    }\n}, {\n    key: 'email',\n    type: 'input',\n    templateOptions: {\n        type: 'email',\n        label: 'Email',\n        required: true,\n        focus: true\n    }\n}, {\n    key: 'password',\n    type: 'input',\n    templateOptions: {\n        type: 'password',\n        label: 'Password',\n        requred: true\n    }\n}]);\n.

    "gentledepp": "Hi!\nWhile the workaround seems to be OK for @rbfinch, for me it is not as it requires me to add hooks for the serverside valiadtion logic into every field which bloats my field definition.\nIn my use case (and I bet this problem do have many others as well), I also submit data to the server, but the client-side validation logic might not be in-sync with the server side one.\nThus, the clieht expects the data to be valid, while the server complains and sents an \"error\" object back, that contains a key-value-pair object containing of fieldname->errormessage\nNow I need to hook that information into the form in a way that users see what they-ve been doing wrong and update it accordingly. However, I do not want to write too much extra code... :-/\nI tried to use something like described in the following blog post:\nhttp://codetunes.com/2013/server-form-validation-with-angular/\nbut my problem is \n- getting the serverside errormessage displayed\n- clearing the serverside error when the field changes (serverError directive). In the blog the author applies his server-error directive to each input. but that requires me to either adapt the template or bloat my fielddefinitions with ngAttrs definitions. :(\nIs there any chance this could be implemented? If you point me towards the right direction, maybe I can do it and make a PR?\n. hmmm... klicking on your links leads to a 404.... sorry - I do not seem to be familiar with this group-chat feature. could you please post a link to a tutorial or something?\n. Hey thanks - this actually looks awesome\nI will definetly try it out.\nYou may also want to add this sample to the official docs as I bet there are lots of guys out there struggling with exactly this problem!\n. Hmmm... as I followed your approach I came across the next problem: The serverside error is correctly applied to the formly-form field. (in my sample case this is a \"the field username is required\" error).\nHowever as soon as I fill in the \"username\" field, the server-error is not removed and thus I cannot submit the form.  So when the model of the field changes, I need to reset the validationerrors. (especially the \"server\" error)\nAny hints on how you solved this?\nAlso: This is still quite a lot of code to implement. I would really appreciate if this functionality could be pulled into formly. E.g. by allowing to specify a \"externalErrors\" object on the  directive which in the end is nothing different than your \"{ errors: [{ message: 'Unknown error' }]};\" object. :-|\n. well ok, so I will have to create all templates myself.\nI just thought I could use the bootstrap templates not have to change them.\nThank you for your help! :)\n. Sorry for not anwering for such a long time.\nI just wanted to say:\nthanks man - works like a charm!\n. Hi! I require the same functionality as I have a datepicker which stores the selected value in the same format as it was displayed.

I am not that good in angular, so I do not know how to use parsers and/or formatters.\nI solved it by introducing another directive which encapsulates the kendo-ui datetimepicker widget that causes this issue, because it stores the selected date in the display format (what did they think when programming this....)\nHowever, I believe this is a very important aspect of binding. \nSo if there was a way in angular-formly to specify a gettersetter function which gets the current $scope as parameter, that would be a HUGE benefit. ;-)\nThanks anyways\n. in what way has this been released? I cannot find any documentation? Do I have to read the source code? :-|\n. Hi!\nWhile the workaround seems to be OK for @rbfinch, for me it is not as it requires me to add hooks for the serverside valiadtion logic into every field which bloats my field definition.\nIn my use case (and I bet this problem do have many others as well), I also submit data to the server, but the client-side validation logic might not be in-sync with the server side one.\nThus, the clieht expects the data to be valid, while the server complains and sents an \"error\" object back, that contains a key-value-pair object containing of fieldname->errormessage\nNow I need to hook that information into the form in a way that users see what they-ve been doing wrong and update it accordingly. However, I do not want to write too much extra code... :-/\nI tried to use something like described in the following blog post:\nhttp://codetunes.com/2013/server-form-validation-with-angular/\nbut my problem is \n- getting the serverside errormessage displayed\n- clearing the serverside error when the field changes (serverError directive). In the blog the author applies his server-error directive to each input. but that requires me to either adapt the template or bloat my fielddefinitions with ngAttrs definitions. :(\nIs there any chance this could be implemented? If you point me towards the right direction, maybe I can do it and make a PR?\n. hmmm... klicking on your links leads to a 404.... sorry - I do not seem to be familiar with this group-chat feature. could you please post a link to a tutorial or something?\n. Hey thanks - this actually looks awesome\nI will definetly try it out.\nYou may also want to add this sample to the official docs as I bet there are lots of guys out there struggling with exactly this problem!\n. Hmmm... as I followed your approach I came across the next problem: The serverside error is correctly applied to the formly-form field. (in my sample case this is a \"the field username is required\" error).\nHowever as soon as I fill in the \"username\" field, the server-error is not removed and thus I cannot submit the form.  So when the model of the field changes, I need to reset the validationerrors. (especially the \"server\" error)\nAny hints on how you solved this?\nAlso: This is still quite a lot of code to implement. I would really appreciate if this functionality could be pulled into formly. E.g. by allowing to specify a \"externalErrors\" object on the  directive which in the end is nothing different than your \"{ errors: [{ message: 'Unknown error' }]};\" object. :-|\n. well ok, so I will have to create all templates myself.\nI just thought I could use the bootstrap templates not have to change them.\nThank you for your help! :)\n. Sorry for not anwering for such a long time.\nI just wanted to say:\nthanks man - works like a charm!\n. Hi!

Wouldn't that be akward/counterintuitive?\nvm.formFields = [\n      // ...\n      {\n        model: 'model.address',\n        fieldGroup: [\n          // ...\n          {\n            model: 'model.address.place',\n            fieldGroup: [\n                // ...\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ];\n_Update_: Another benefit of having a key string is that it remains untouched at runtime (as opposed to a model string), allowing to retrieve the original structure. Ex. use-case: getting $dirty fields from nested forms\n. Wow that was fast @kentcdodds ! I was already working on it but was nowhere near, you saved my day!,Thanks!\n. Sorry for the mess @kentcdodds , I'm still struggling to learn OSS collaboration procedures.\nI'll try again as soon as I have an Unix environment available, BTW this situation must have been faced by many other projects, I'll investigate\n_Update_: Seems that using a middleware to handle it may be the most viable option\n. There are a lot of examples in the webpage, you can use a formly watcher:\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/field-options/watchers\nOr as @siddharthkchatterjee said, you can use $scope.$watch in the controller\nThere are many alternatives since angular-formly is quite flexible, use the one that suits your needs. :smile: \n. The best way to get help is to get a failing example in jsbin/jsfiddle/... and then ask in gitter.im/formly-js/angular-formly\nAlso take a look at Questions/Help section and the corresponding video\n. For anyone wondering here's an example: http://jsbin.com/jinaca/1/edit?js,output\n. Agree, this was something I personally faced when learning angular-formly and having used formController before.\n. You might want to take a look at:\n- https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#controllers\n- https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide#controllers\n. Hi! I'm a the author of the original example.\nThanks for spotting the issue, it looks like the problem is with ui-select, could you isolate the example without involving angular-formly at all?\nMaybe then we can open an issue in ui-select's repo :smile: \nThanks!\n. :smile: \n. > \n\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly. The issues are for bug reports/feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.

Done, I'm not sure if that's the proper place to test it\n. Great, let me rewrite it for a better organization\n. ready!\n. no prob, glad to be helpful! :hand: \n. The output looks like that because stdout is streamed directly to console.log.\nMaybe directly using process.stdout.write can fix it.\nI'll try again tomorrow ASAP, as I will optimize the code for all scripts :)\n.

Okey, already created a draft version at github.com/benoror/better-npm-run.\nRight now I don't have any project that could use it, but if you think it has potential to be used by angular-formly or anything-else in the future let me know.\n. Hey that's great @kentcdodds! :smile: considering that I wrote the draft on-the-go this afternoon.\nAnyway, please let me know if you have a particular use-case or idea for extending its functionality, I opened a general issue for brainstorming: https://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run/issues/1\nRegards!\n. Can you provide a JSBin example (as explained in CONTRIBUTING.md) using template-wrappers along with fieldGroups?\n. Shouldn't it just rely on NgModelController's $parsers & $formatters existing functionality?\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/ngModel.NgModelController#$parsers\n. My toughts:\n1. Since \"The functions are called in reverse array order\" I think the ones in defaultOptions should have more precedence, therefore should be pushed last\n2. Since pushing a function with the same name won't override it, I see 2 possible opts:\n   1. A simple mechanism to override defaultOptions when specifying the same name (acting more like an object)\n   2. Use of ID's to specify overriding\n. Although this is an edge (but maybe not too unrealistic) example, I agree, as this is what I would expect from an execution-order standpoint: the more specific a {parser,formatter} is, the later it should be applied.\n. You shall use Expression Properties as explained here:\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/field-options/expression-properties\nHere's a working example:\nhttp://jsbin.com/kigozo/edit?html,js,console,output\n.

You're not @kentcdodds, I was deceived by an outdated version of formly and incomplete documentation.\nSorry for the false negative (mondays.. (-, - )\u2026zzzZZZ), you can close the issue now.\nBTW, Still looking forward for that blog post regarding npm config set save-exact=true, next-update, etc \n( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n. Hey @BartVDACodeware !\nWhat happened in the end? Did you find a workaround?\nI think I'm having a similar issue with another Tree project: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/533\nThanks! :smiley_cat: \n. Supposing I succeeded figuring out your cryptic message, I guess what you're looking for is custom templates: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/custom-templates\n. @estaub angular-formly is agnostic regarding template/controls/widgets rendering. You could implement multiselect/tagging by yourself, or easily adapt an existing solution using custom templates, as explained in the documentation.\nFor multiselect/tagging I've seen that ui-select supports it, and I will implement it eventually for my project (which should be rather easy considering an existing example like this), but there should be plenty of different alternatives, in the end JavaScript kinda popular these days :smile: \n. @estaub don't worry, a quick search threw me around 3k results:\nhttps://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=tagging&ref=searchresults&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93\nBTW, let me know whenever you've found a good candidate and implemented a custom template!\nGood luck!\n. @gentledepp https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/commit/2cb7d2e8758a78fd083e257d57ea9dddd588a1ae#diff-4830f282e0aa2d5c786eb691f55beb43R2095\nDocs: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/field-configuration-object#extras-object\n. Hi @nomack84, warm welcome to Cuba! I recently had a similar requirement, but unfortunately fieldGroups doesn't support template wrappers.\nBut I achieved the same result making use of the data property inside a custom type called nested, take a look: http://jsbin.com/zaqeke\nAlso @kentcdodds came with a slightly different approach, by using two fields arrays, take a look: http://jsbin.com/setupi\n@kentcdodds shall I submit it as an example for the website?\n. @netowp in the JSBin it's included inside an script tag, since JSBin doesn't support multiple files afaik:\n<script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"panel.html\">\n...\n</script>\nIn your project you'll likely have it in a separate file, or if you'd like yo might use ES6 multi-line strings, like this:\nformlyConfigProvider.setWrapper({\n      name: 'panel',\n      template: `\n          ...\n      `\n    });\n. It's almost certainly better-npm-run's fault, as it was a quick hack I didn't paid enough attention to the way stderr should be handled in the callback.\nI opened the following issue, could you elaborate on it?\nhttps://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run/issues/6\nThanks!\n. As I pm'd you, I don't feel savvy enough with angular-formly codebase/testing.\nNevertheless I might be able to help filtering worthy issues, commenting on them & closing the redundat ones.\nI would like to publicly reiterate my appreciation for your hard work on the project\nKudos :+1: and all the best wishes :family:\n. count with me :+1: \n. Unfortunately fieldGroup doesn't support wrappers, and adding them would mean adding complexity to angular-formly.\nFortunately there's a simple way to accomplish the same results using custom templates.\nDid you take a look at the nested-form example?:\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/nested-formly-forms\n. Done!\n. @holtjonathan I agree, having wrapper support for fieldgroups would simplify things\n. > @benoror Thanks for sharing the example. I noticed that you have used wrapper as panel.\n\nIs there a list of possible wrappers that can be used?\n\n@jayasrinagrale Any template can be used using setWrapper, please refer to the stack overflow link and the provided example.

Done, thanks for letting me know!\n. @brutalcrozt Try with a recent version of Node 4.* or even 5.* :smile: \n. Calling vm.options.resetModel() doesn't seem to propagate to nested formly-form's (However stuff like vm.form seem to be correctly inherited).\n- http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/formly-form#section-resetmodel-and-updateinitialvalue\nIf I bind the options variable to the template now resetModel() resets the nested fields, although ignoring the outer scope fields, see example: http://jsbin.com/zaqeke/18/edit?html,js,output\n. @kentcdodds Do you think this can be fixed in angular-formly itself (maybe related to https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/465) ?\nOr it might be related to the way angular handles nested forms, something along the lines of\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/11023\nUpdate: This seems to work for fieldGroup's. I'm going to write some tests \n. Ok I wrote a failing test for this issue: \nexpected { innerField: 'zab' } to deeply equal { innerField: 'bar' }\nI suspect this is related to nested keys handling https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/426, any hint where should I look at?\n. @MCKRUZ you're right! :smile_cat: \nTherefore instead of messing up with data a cleaner solution would be to use a wrapper around a _fieldGroup_, which is something already planned to implement in https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/486 :tada: (although support for templateOptions should be also considered, in order to customize panel's title)\nJSBin example: http://jsbin.com/zaqeke/20/edit?html,js,output\n@kentcdodds What do you think? Using something already proven (like fieldGroup) sounds better that reinventing the wheel IMHO\n. I believe I managed to fix this, along with #486 \ndo you mind checking out a working example at  http://jsbin.com/zaqeke/21/edit?html,js,output\n.

Hi @koraybalci , The reason is that it is difficult for maintainers to keep up with issues. Having an example would help us quickly diagnose the problem, which most of the time are not bugs nor features requests, but simply misuse or lack of understanding of the library. Therefore the suggested channels (chat, stack overflow, mailing list) are much better suited for those cases.\nAnyway, if you can make an example (new-example.angular-formly.com) to reproduce the issue I can give you some feedback right here :smile: \n. From my understanding a data model with N levels of empty nested models should look like this:\nX= {\n  Y: {\n    A: {\n      K: {}\n    },\n    B: {}\n  }\n}\nSetting an empty model to null wouldn't make sense in this scenario, that's why formly defaults to an empty object {}. \nMaybe the issue is the way it's handled in your backend, what server technology do you use?\n. Fair enough, you have 2 options:\n1. Test, fix and submit a PR\n   - Unit tests around here, here, and even here\n   - Change de code around here and maybe in formly-form.js as well\n2. Transform your payload before sending it back to the backend. It would be trivial to use Underscore/Lodash for such task, a quick google search spit this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14058193/remove-empty-properties-falsy-values-from-object-with-underscore-js\n. ping @kentcdodds (maybe Kent can provide valuable feedback :smile:)\n.

Wow never heard of that one, looks pretty awesome!\n. @Den-dp could you please test https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/316 in an *nix environment since I don't have acces to one ATM\n. Wouldn't key property for fieldGroup make more sense?:\nJSBin: http://jsbin.com/tusubo/1/\n. Added both: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/314\n. Hi @kentcdodds !\nFor https://github.com/benoror/angular-formly/commit/629e758e347631f021e6bdd31919cbae2ec5391a the local-examples/ demo works, but to be honest I'm not 100% sure my implementation is correct. Please take it with caution\n. Regarding package.json script update, you mean issue https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/305?\n. Also,  https://github.com/benoror/angular-formly/commit/d8fd28150633f4eb9bfe36e2dce8d696b097ac2f and https://github.com/benoror/angular-formly/commit/e8a0c6a9da32e7f8b63a887f97de02ee2ecf156b added support for key property in fieldGroup, but again I'm not totally confident of my patch.\nDemo works but I had to comment-out one failing test. I guess I'm setting the model & key the wrong way (also considering the case for number-ish (index) keys).\nLet me know your thoughts. Regards!\n. It works like a charm, thanks @kentcdodds !\nBTW, would it be much trouble to support key property in fieldGroup? A use-case would be to support multi-level nested forms:\nModel:\nvm.formData = {\n          \"name\": \"John\",\n          \"address\": {\n              \"streetnum\": \"145 Elm St.\",\n              \"place\": {\n                \"state\": \"GA\",\n                \"city\": \"Atlanta\"\n              }\n          }\n    };\nFields:\nvm.formFields = [\n      {\n        key: 'name',\n        type: 'input',\n        templateOptions: {\n          label: 'Name'\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        key: 'address',\n        fieldGroup: [\n          {\n            key: 'streetnum',\n            type: 'input',\n            templateOptions: {\n              label: 'Street Num'\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'place',\n            fieldGroup: [\n                {\n                    key: 'state',\n                    type: 'input',\n                    templateOptions: {\n                      label: 'State'\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    key: 'city',\n                    type: 'input',\n                    templateOptions: {\n                      label: 'City'\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ];\n. Wouldn't that be akward/counterintuitive?\nvm.formFields = [\n      // ...\n      {\n        model: 'model.address',\n        fieldGroup: [\n          // ...\n          {\n            model: 'model.address.place',\n            fieldGroup: [\n                // ...\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ];\n_Update_: Another benefit of having a key string is that it remains untouched at runtime (as opposed to a model string), allowing to retrieve the original structure. Ex. use-case: getting $dirty fields from nested forms\n. Wow that was fast @kentcdodds ! I was already working on it but was nowhere near, you saved my day!,Thanks!\n. Sorry for the mess @kentcdodds , I'm still struggling to learn OSS collaboration procedures.\nI'll try again as soon as I have an Unix environment available, BTW this situation must have been faced by many other projects, I'll investigate\n_Update_: Seems that using a middleware to handle it may be the most viable option\n. There are a lot of examples in the webpage, you can use a formly watcher:\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/field-options/watchers\nOr as @siddharthkchatterjee said, you can use $scope.$watch in the controller\nThere are many alternatives since angular-formly is quite flexible, use the one that suits your needs. :smile: \n. The best way to get help is to get a failing example in jsbin/jsfiddle/... and then ask in gitter.im/formly-js/angular-formly\nAlso take a look at Questions/Help section and the corresponding video\n. For anyone wondering here's an example: http://jsbin.com/jinaca/1/edit?js,output\n. Agree, this was something I personally faced when learning angular-formly and having used formController before.\n. You might want to take a look at:\n- https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#controllers\n- https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide#controllers\n. Hi! I'm a the author of the original example.\nThanks for spotting the issue, it looks like the problem is with ui-select, could you isolate the example without involving angular-formly at all?\nMaybe then we can open an issue in ui-select's repo :smile: \nThanks!\n. :smile: \n. > \n\nThanks for your interest in angular-formly. The issues are for bug reports/feature requests, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.

Okey, already created a draft version at github.com/benoror/better-npm-run.\nRight now I don't have any project that could use it, but if you think it has potential to be used by angular-formly or anything-else in the future let me know.\n. Hey that's great @kentcdodds! :smile: considering that I wrote the draft on-the-go this afternoon.\nAnyway, please let me know if you have a particular use-case or idea for extending its functionality, I opened a general issue for brainstorming: https://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run/issues/1\nRegards!\n. Can you provide a JSBin example (as explained in CONTRIBUTING.md) using template-wrappers along with fieldGroups?\n. Shouldn't it just rely on NgModelController's $parsers & $formatters existing functionality?\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/ngModel.NgModelController#$parsers\n. My toughts:\n1. Since \"The functions are called in reverse array order\" I think the ones in defaultOptions should have more precedence, therefore should be pushed last\n2. Since pushing a function with the same name won't override it, I see 2 possible opts:\n   1. A simple mechanism to override defaultOptions when specifying the same name (acting more like an object)\n   2. Use of ID's to specify overriding\n. Although this is an edge (but maybe not too unrealistic) example, I agree, as this is what I would expect from an execution-order standpoint: the more specific a {parser,formatter} is, the later it should be applied.\n. You shall use Expression Properties as explained here:\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/field-options/expression-properties\nHere's a working example:\nhttp://jsbin.com/kigozo/edit?html,js,console,output\n.

Hey @BartVDACodeware !\nWhat happened in the end? Did you find a workaround?\nI think I'm having a similar issue with another Tree project: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/533\nThanks! :smiley_cat: \n. Supposing I succeeded figuring out your cryptic message, I guess what you're looking for is custom templates: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/custom-templates\n. @estaub angular-formly is agnostic regarding template/controls/widgets rendering. You could implement multiselect/tagging by yourself, or easily adapt an existing solution using custom templates, as explained in the documentation.\nFor multiselect/tagging I've seen that ui-select supports it, and I will implement it eventually for my project (which should be rather easy considering an existing example like this), but there should be plenty of different alternatives, in the end JavaScript kinda popular these days :smile: \n. @estaub don't worry, a quick search threw me around 3k results:\nhttps://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=tagging&ref=searchresults&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93\nBTW, let me know whenever you've found a good candidate and implemented a custom template!\nGood luck!\n. @gentledepp https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/commit/2cb7d2e8758a78fd083e257d57ea9dddd588a1ae#diff-4830f282e0aa2d5c786eb691f55beb43R2095\nDocs: http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/field-configuration-object#extras-object\n. Hi @nomack84, warm welcome to Cuba! I recently had a similar requirement, but unfortunately fieldGroups doesn't support template wrappers.\nBut I achieved the same result making use of the data property inside a custom type called nested, take a look: http://jsbin.com/zaqeke\nAlso @kentcdodds came with a slightly different approach, by using two fields arrays, take a look: http://jsbin.com/setupi\n@kentcdodds shall I submit it as an example for the website?\n. @netowp in the JSBin it's included inside an script tag, since JSBin doesn't support multiple files afaik:\n<script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"panel.html\">\n...\n</script>\nIn your project you'll likely have it in a separate file, or if you'd like yo might use ES6 multi-line strings, like this:\nformlyConfigProvider.setWrapper({\n      name: 'panel',\n      template: `\n          ...\n      `\n    });\n. It's almost certainly better-npm-run's fault, as it was a quick hack I didn't paid enough attention to the way stderr should be handled in the callback.\nI opened the following issue, could you elaborate on it?\nhttps://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run/issues/6\nThanks!\n. As I pm'd you, I don't feel savvy enough with angular-formly codebase/testing.\nNevertheless I might be able to help filtering worthy issues, commenting on them & closing the redundat ones.\nI would like to publicly reiterate my appreciation for your hard work on the project\nKudos :+1: and all the best wishes :family:\n. count with me :+1: \n. Unfortunately fieldGroup doesn't support wrappers, and adding them would mean adding complexity to angular-formly.\nFortunately there's a simple way to accomplish the same results using custom templates.\nDid you take a look at the nested-form example?:\nhttp://angular-formly.com/#/example/other/nested-formly-forms\n. Done!\n. @holtjonathan I agree, having wrapper support for fieldgroups would simplify things\n. > @benoror Thanks for sharing the example. I noticed that you have used wrapper as panel.\n\nIs there a list of possible wrappers that can be used?\n\n@jayasrinagrale Any template can be used using setWrapper, please refer to the stack overflow link and the provided example.

Done, thanks for letting me know!\n. @brutalcrozt Try with a recent version of Node 4.* or even 5.* :smile: \n. Calling vm.options.resetModel() doesn't seem to propagate to nested formly-form's (However stuff like vm.form seem to be correctly inherited).\n- http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/formly-form#section-resetmodel-and-updateinitialvalue\nIf I bind the options variable to the template now resetModel() resets the nested fields, although ignoring the outer scope fields, see example: http://jsbin.com/zaqeke/18/edit?html,js,output\n. @kentcdodds Do you think this can be fixed in angular-formly itself (maybe related to https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/465) ?\nOr it might be related to the way angular handles nested forms, something along the lines of\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/11023\nUpdate: This seems to work for fieldGroup's. I'm going to write some tests \n. Ok I wrote a failing test for this issue: \nexpected { innerField: 'zab' } to deeply equal { innerField: 'bar' }\nI suspect this is related to nested keys handling https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/426, any hint where should I look at?\n. @MCKRUZ you're right! :smile_cat: \nTherefore instead of messing up with data a cleaner solution would be to use a wrapper around a _fieldGroup_, which is something already planned to implement in https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/486 :tada: (although support for templateOptions should be also considered, in order to customize panel's title)\nJSBin example: http://jsbin.com/zaqeke/20/edit?html,js,output\n@kentcdodds What do you think? Using something already proven (like fieldGroup) sounds better that reinventing the wheel IMHO\n. I believe I managed to fix this, along with #486 \ndo you mind checking out a working example at  http://jsbin.com/zaqeke/21/edit?html,js,output\n.

I saw you replaced the model for each key, therefore you never saw the changes.\nWhat you need to do is to match the model in the key itself.\nSee corrected example: http://jsbin.com/pupijoc/1/edit?js,console,output\n.

Hi @koraybalci , The reason is that it is difficult for maintainers to keep up with issues. Having an example would help us quickly diagnose the problem, which most of the time are not bugs nor features requests, but simply misuse or lack of understanding of the library. Therefore the suggested channels (chat, stack overflow, mailing list) are much better suited for those cases.\nAnyway, if you can make an example (new-example.angular-formly.com) to reproduce the issue I can give you some feedback right here :smile: \n. From my understanding a data model with N levels of empty nested models should look like this:\nX= {\n  Y: {\n    A: {\n      K: {}\n    },\n    B: {}\n  }\n}\nSetting an empty model to null wouldn't make sense in this scenario, that's why formly defaults to an empty object {}. \nMaybe the issue is the way it's handled in your backend, what server technology do you use?\n. Fair enough, you have 2 options:\n1. Test, fix and submit a PR\n   - Unit tests around here, here, and even here\n   - Change de code around here and maybe in formly-form.js as well\n2. Transform your payload before sending it back to the backend. It would be trivial to use Underscore/Lodash for such task, a quick google search spit this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14058193/remove-empty-properties-falsy-values-from-object-with-underscore-js\n. ping @kentcdodds (maybe Kent can provide valuable feedback :smile:)\n.

Thanks.\n. I just watched the egghead.io video on validation and it does appear that the validators object key can be anything.

Will do, thanks.\n. So here's something interesting with that Codementor example and I can reproduce it in a Plunker.  The Chrome console is throwing an error when focus is gained and then lost on the IP Address field.

The form and validation still work correctly.

Cool, thanks for following up on that.  We're currently using (but probably don't need to be) full jQuery so that alleviates that issue.\nI've been working on this problem all morning and it does not appear that, at least in my plunker setup, I can use both default messages in my validation.html file and overrides in the validation.messages object.  E.g., <div class=\"some-message\" ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div> and\nvalidation: {\n  messages: {\n    required: function (viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n      return scope.to.label + ' is required';\n    }\n  }\n}\nIf I get rid of the default messages in validation.html the values defined in validation.messages are used.\nOn a whim, I updated the plunker to angular 1.4 RC1 and I get a different error which actually makes sense:\nError: [$compile:nonassign] Expression 'field.model || model' used with directive 'formlyField' is non-assignable!\nhttp://errors.angularjs.org/1.4.0-rc.1/$compile/nonassign?p0=field.model%20%7C%7C%20model&p1=formlyField\n    at REGEX_STRING_REGEXP (angular.js:68)\n    at $get.parentSet (angular.js:8571)\n    at parentValueWatch (angular.js:8584)\n    at Object.regularInterceptedExpression (angular.js:14010)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$digest (angular.js:15403)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$apply (angular.js:15679)\n    at NgModelController.$$debounceViewValueCommit (angular.js:24748)\n    at NgModelController.$setViewValue (angular.js:24720)\n    at HTMLInputElement.listener (angular.js:21096)\n    at HTMLInputElement.n.event.dispatch (jquery-2.1.4.min.js:3)\nIt appears that it's trying to bind the validation.messages.required function on my First Name field, which is not allowed per the angular error URL.\nI'm ok for now in just using the default values in my validation.html file but it would be nice to be able to override them at some point.  As for now, I don't have a use case to do so.\nI'll wait for you to respond before closing.  Thanks.\n. Good deal, thanks.\n. I'm open to your suggestions/thoughts on this.\nRight now I have it making a service call (the second option) when the controller function is loaded and just pushing a new item into the fields array.  I suspect I'll have to wait until we deploy to production to test the full on latency/UX ramifications of this because on my machine and on our QA servers it's loading fine w/ almost no noticeable delay - even using the mobile network throttling feature of the Chrome debuggger - I took it down to 2G and it was still fine.  It's only 848 bytes of uncompressed data and we have compression turned on.\n. I'm already doing that for our $modals.  Never occurred to me to do that for remote data.  I like it, thanks.\n. Oh, ok.  Cool.  Thanks.\n. That was more a tongue-in-cheek comment.  I'm a firm believer in fail early, fail fast.  So keep on api-checkin'.\nI fixed the config.  I free typed it in and the default text editor in github is rubbish - I should have typed it a proper text editor (like Notepad) and then pasted it.\nHere's the use case:  This is a user admin page and the validator is on the username field.  One of the validators on the username field checks to see if the username is already taken.  This all works great for creating new users.  When I go to edit an existing user, the username field is populated, but disabled (via expressionProperties['templateOptions.disabled']) and this uniqueUsername validator is still triggered even if the field is disabled.  Thus, my Save button remains disabled because the form is still being reported as invalid - and indeed if one looks at the $errors object on the form, the uniqueUsername is present.\nSo, I'm thinking either we need a way to disable the validators, or perhaps more appropriately, the validators should not be triggered when a field is disabled - but this could get tricky as it starts to depend on the order in which formly evaluates the formly expressions.\nAs I mentioned, I have a temporary workaround in that I've added a conditional to my vm.someFunc expression - but I sure would like to do this the correct way.\n. I follow the last bit on isEditMode but I don't follow how to NOT add a validator based on that boolean.\n. Ah, got it.  That will work nicely.  Thanks.\n. So api-check doesn't like undefined as a value for the validator.  If isEditMode is false, it's fine, but if not, it yells and says:\n`` javascript\nError: angular-formly: formly-field directive apiCheck failed!validatorsatArgument 1/valuemust beobjectOf[oneOfType[oneOfType[String, Function], strict shape]]`  formly-field-directive-validation-failed\n/ snip /\n\"validators\": {\n  \"__apiCheckData\": {\n    \"optional\": true,\n    \"type\": \"objectOf\",\n    \"error\": \"THIS IS THE PROBLEM: validators must be objectOf[oneOfType[oneOfType[String, Function], strict shape]]\"\n  },\n/ snip /\n```\nThoughts?\n. That would work.  It does change the \"implied paradigm\" (and I use that phrase quite loosely) of defining all the fields in the same array.  But it does only conditionally add the validator - meaning it's simply not at all there if in edit mode.\nHere's what I wound up doing:  I was hoping that angular.noop would work instead of undefined but angular installs an $inject property on everything, including angular.noop, so that doesn't work because api-check checks for extraneous properties.  And it turns out it wouldn't work anyway because the validator function needs to return either a resolved or rejected $promise, so what I did was create a utility service that had a noopResolve function and that works like a charm.\nAlthough, it could be argued that at this point, why not just add the conditional to the vm.someFunc to make it just return a resolved promise and honestly, I don't have good answer here.\n. I wrote too soon.  Sorry. One sec.\n. Gaaaaaaah.  When am I going to learn that formly expressions need to be quoted.....?  Both 'undefined' and 'true' work.  I can't say how many times I've been bitten by that.  Thanks again.\n. I'm sure it is.  It's so easy to do and whether you add them or not, it's valid J/S.  The only difference is when it gets evaluated.\nI was thinking about if there was a way to pre-parse it to see if there was potentially an error, but as you said, there's not.\nThanks again. :smiley:\n. That makes absolute sense.  When you say separate file, you mean template HTML file, right?  I like the idea of separate .config calls - I'm going to break mine apart.  And yes, totally cool closing this.  Thanks.\n. Sorry.  Not intended.  Where would you like me to post the follow up (and future help requests)?  I'm working on the JS Bin.  Thanks.\n. Oy.  Sorry, i should have read the instructions before just starting work on the example.  Thanks for being so patient.\n. Done.\n. Thanks!  Will give this a go.\n.

Here's the stacktrace:\nTypeError: element.setAttribute is not a function\n    at forEach.attr (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:2887:15)\n    at Object.JQLite.(anonymous function) [as attr] (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:2986:9)\n    at Object.$get.Attributes.$set (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:6829:28)\n    at interpolateFnWatchAction (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:8157:28)\n    at interpolateFnWatcher (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:10216:26)\n    at Object.watchGroupAction (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:13980:13)\n    at Object.oneTimeListener [as fn] (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:12852:20)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$digest (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:14308:29)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$apply (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:14571:24)\n    at HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.js:23644:21)\nI'll keep moving forward using the Codementor example.\n. Cool, thanks for following up on that.  We're currently using (but probably don't need to be) full jQuery so that alleviates that issue.\nI've been working on this problem all morning and it does not appear that, at least in my plunker setup, I can use both default messages in my validation.html file and overrides in the validation.messages object.  E.g., <div class=\"some-message\" ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div> and\nvalidation: {\n  messages: {\n    required: function (viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n      return scope.to.label + ' is required';\n    }\n  }\n}\nIf I get rid of the default messages in validation.html the values defined in validation.messages are used.\nOn a whim, I updated the plunker to angular 1.4 RC1 and I get a different error which actually makes sense:\nError: [$compile:nonassign] Expression 'field.model || model' used with directive 'formlyField' is non-assignable!\nhttp://errors.angularjs.org/1.4.0-rc.1/$compile/nonassign?p0=field.model%20%7C%7C%20model&p1=formlyField\n    at REGEX_STRING_REGEXP (angular.js:68)\n    at $get.parentSet (angular.js:8571)\n    at parentValueWatch (angular.js:8584)\n    at Object.regularInterceptedExpression (angular.js:14010)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$digest (angular.js:15403)\n    at Scope.$get.Scope.$apply (angular.js:15679)\n    at NgModelController.$$debounceViewValueCommit (angular.js:24748)\n    at NgModelController.$setViewValue (angular.js:24720)\n    at HTMLInputElement.listener (angular.js:21096)\n    at HTMLInputElement.n.event.dispatch (jquery-2.1.4.min.js:3)\nIt appears that it's trying to bind the validation.messages.required function on my First Name field, which is not allowed per the angular error URL.\nI'm ok for now in just using the default values in my validation.html file but it would be nice to be able to override them at some point.  As for now, I don't have a use case to do so.\nI'll wait for you to respond before closing.  Thanks.\n. Good deal, thanks.\n. I'm open to your suggestions/thoughts on this.\nRight now I have it making a service call (the second option) when the controller function is loaded and just pushing a new item into the fields array.  I suspect I'll have to wait until we deploy to production to test the full on latency/UX ramifications of this because on my machine and on our QA servers it's loading fine w/ almost no noticeable delay - even using the mobile network throttling feature of the Chrome debuggger - I took it down to 2G and it was still fine.  It's only 848 bytes of uncompressed data and we have compression turned on.\n. I'm already doing that for our $modals.  Never occurred to me to do that for remote data.  I like it, thanks.\n. Oh, ok.  Cool.  Thanks.\n. That was more a tongue-in-cheek comment.  I'm a firm believer in fail early, fail fast.  So keep on api-checkin'.\nI fixed the config.  I free typed it in and the default text editor in github is rubbish - I should have typed it a proper text editor (like Notepad) and then pasted it.\nHere's the use case:  This is a user admin page and the validator is on the username field.  One of the validators on the username field checks to see if the username is already taken.  This all works great for creating new users.  When I go to edit an existing user, the username field is populated, but disabled (via expressionProperties['templateOptions.disabled']) and this uniqueUsername validator is still triggered even if the field is disabled.  Thus, my Save button remains disabled because the form is still being reported as invalid - and indeed if one looks at the $errors object on the form, the uniqueUsername is present.\nSo, I'm thinking either we need a way to disable the validators, or perhaps more appropriately, the validators should not be triggered when a field is disabled - but this could get tricky as it starts to depend on the order in which formly evaluates the formly expressions.\nAs I mentioned, I have a temporary workaround in that I've added a conditional to my vm.someFunc expression - but I sure would like to do this the correct way.\n. I follow the last bit on isEditMode but I don't follow how to NOT add a validator based on that boolean.\n. Ah, got it.  That will work nicely.  Thanks.\n. So api-check doesn't like undefined as a value for the validator.  If isEditMode is false, it's fine, but if not, it yells and says:\n`` javascript\nError: angular-formly: formly-field directive apiCheck failed!validatorsatArgument 1/valuemust beobjectOf[oneOfType[oneOfType[String, Function], strict shape]]`  formly-field-directive-validation-failed\n/ snip /\n\"validators\": {\n  \"__apiCheckData\": {\n    \"optional\": true,\n    \"type\": \"objectOf\",\n    \"error\": \"THIS IS THE PROBLEM: validators must be objectOf[oneOfType[oneOfType[String, Function], strict shape]]\"\n  },\n/ snip /\n```\nThoughts?\n. That would work.  It does change the \"implied paradigm\" (and I use that phrase quite loosely) of defining all the fields in the same array.  But it does only conditionally add the validator - meaning it's simply not at all there if in edit mode.\nHere's what I wound up doing:  I was hoping that angular.noop would work instead of undefined but angular installs an $inject property on everything, including angular.noop, so that doesn't work because api-check checks for extraneous properties.  And it turns out it wouldn't work anyway because the validator function needs to return either a resolved or rejected $promise, so what I did was create a utility service that had a noopResolve function and that works like a charm.\nAlthough, it could be argued that at this point, why not just add the conditional to the vm.someFunc to make it just return a resolved promise and honestly, I don't have good answer here.\n. I wrote too soon.  Sorry. One sec.\n. Gaaaaaaah.  When am I going to learn that formly expressions need to be quoted.....?  Both 'undefined' and 'true' work.  I can't say how many times I've been bitten by that.  Thanks again.\n. I'm sure it is.  It's so easy to do and whether you add them or not, it's valid J/S.  The only difference is when it gets evaluated.\nI was thinking about if there was a way to pre-parse it to see if there was potentially an error, but as you said, there's not.\nThanks again. :smiley:\n. That makes absolute sense.  When you say separate file, you mean template HTML file, right?  I like the idea of separate .config calls - I'm going to break mine apart.  And yes, totally cool closing this.  Thanks.\n. Sorry.  Not intended.  Where would you like me to post the follow up (and future help requests)?  I'm working on the JS Bin.  Thanks.\n. Oy.  Sorry, i should have read the instructions before just starting work on the example.  Thanks for being so patient.\n. Done.\n. ",

That being said, I am 100% for dropping 1.2 support if it means you can make Formly better - all I ask is that you provide a clear version number cutoff for when support is officially dropped so that we can lock down our dependency to that version.\n.

Use case:\n{\n    \"type\": \"radio\",\n    \"key\": \"falseValues\",\n    \"defaultValue\": false,\n    \"templateOptions\": {\n        \"label\": \"Does this work with false values?\",\n        \"options\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Yes\",\n                \"value\": true\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"No\",\n                \"value\": false\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n. D'oh! Makes sense. Thanks :)\n. We're currently using 1.2 for IE8 support. We plan on dropping IE8 at some point (it's being discussed), but I have no idea as far as the timeline goes.  That being said, I am 100% for dropping 1.2 support if it means you can make Formly better - all I ask is that you provide a clear version number cutoff for when support is officially dropped so that we can lock down our dependency to that version.\n.

    "ckniffen": "I work on a team that develops tools used by a number of different apps and I have a abstract select type that other teams extend that internally leverages ui-select.  An example of this is we have user and userGroup types which extend selectResource.  All types that extend selectResource need to run through a templateManipulator.  I will work on creating a plnkr of this to better demonstrate the use case.\n. That will work perfect.  I forgot about the getType method on formlyConfig.  Thank you.\n. I am currently using angular 1.3 and we have not encountered this causing issues just yet.  I noticed it while debugging something unrelated and had remembered that during a previous version there was a fix for this and realized this was an uncovered edge case.  Your solution is fine.\n. Does it need to make the assumption that all elements with ngModel map to the same value?\nI ask because of https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/573a9b070097f1ccd8f55eada4df2f8be7255e4e/src/directives/formly-field.js#L155.\n. I think it is still valid use case.  I have run into myself with a date-picker and time-picker directive in one field template.  I will have a PR sometime tonight.  It will only work if each instance of ngModel has a different name though.\nThis will not fix the symptoms seen in https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap/issues/19 though because in that case each element with ngModel in that template has the same name.  The following use case is the one that will be covered:\nhtml\n<input type=\"input\" name=\"start\" ng-model=\"options.model[options.key].stop\" />\n<input type=\"input\" name=\"stop\" ng-model=\"options.model[options.key].start\" />\nThe tests I will be adding cover resetModel and that the formControl is made an array in case of multiple ng-model elements.  Are there any other features that leverage formControl?\n. What is the use case for having falsy templateUrl or template?\n. What are the use cases for 0, false and null? \n. Wrote two failing tests for this issue.  I will have some time tomorrow to do a proper PR with the fix tomorrow.\n```\n  it('should use templateUrl if type defines it and its parent has template defined', function(){\n    setterFn([\n      {\n        name,\n        template\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'type2',\n        extends: name,\n        templateUrl\n      }\n    ]);\nexpect(getterFn('type2').templateUrl).not.to.be.undefined;\nexpect(getterFn('type2').template).to.be.undefined;\n\n});\nit('should use template if type defines it and parent had templateUrl defined', function(){\n    setterFn([\n      {\n        name,\n        templateUrl\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'type2',\n        extends: name,\n        template\n      }\n    ]);\nexpect(getterFn('type2').template).not.to.be.undefined;\nexpect(getterFn('type2').templateUrl).to.be.undefined;\n\n});\n});\n```\n. I may be missunderstanding the issue but I thought the following would work.\n{\n  ngModelAttrs: {\n    foo: {\n      attribute: 'foo'\n    },\n    bar: {\n      attribute: 'bar'\n    }\n  },\n  templateOptions: {\n    foo: true,\n    bar: true\n  }\n}\n. I have a feeling that the use case of an interpolated expression for the value of the dynamically added attribute the issue will still be there but for you example I don't see a problem.\nOne solution would be to change ngModelAttrs to be an array instead of an object.\n. I still think it is a valid issue because you cant have the same expression write to two different attributes just much more of an edge case now.\n. I don't know if this is related to the issue, but what I am most concerned about is that the name attribute of the fields in the repeat section are not unique.  I spent about an hour trying to figure out the issue is with that but to no avail.  I will revisit it tonight.\n. +1\n. My solution for this is to define the custom field's controller using the angular Module.controller method and then in the type definition do:\njavascript\n{\n  controller: 'CustomTypeController as typeCtrl'\n}\n. The only small benefit I could see and that would be if someone wanted the controller definition to be \"private\" but still use controllerAs.  I don't think the benefit warrants a code change though unless there is a huge demand for it.\n. I personally expose most of mine so that they can be enhanced via delegate.  I always forget about angular 1.2 support :)\n. This is because awesome-bootstrap-checkbox requires you to have slightly different markup than you would typically have with bootstrap.  You need to modify the template that angular-formly-templates-bootstrap uses to reflect the required changes.\n. I think this is still the best way.  The only thing I don't yet know about is how to approach the digest.  Do we make it a breaking change or do the hacky thing of calling digest is one isnt running already?\n. I will make the change.\n. The update is there I think everything is now good to go.\n. @kentcdodds do you want me to take point on this?  It is a recurring problem.  I think this issue should be moved to https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap.\n. Are you using controllerAs syntax?  If you are not that could cause the issue you are seeing.\n. You don't have to use controllerAs to work with formly.  The examples are just typically written that way.\n. Actually this would be helpful for when using the same fields array multiple times.  Right now I have to clone each copy of the fields config when creating formly-forms in an ng-repeat where each iteration uses the exact same fields array.\n. If $log.warn was used instead of console.warn would that also resolve this issue?  I am speaking exclusively about angular-formly rather than api-check.\n. @jpuzzo You can achieve the same effect by having a type that has a template that contains a formly-form.  This example shows how to achieve something similar http://angular-formly.com/#/example/advanced/repeating-section.\n. At this moment the feature doesn't exist.  There have been several requests for but it has been put off due to the custom type method working in the interim.  I will try to coming up with something.  Essentially fieldGroup is an api that sits outside of the lifecycle of a field and as such does not have many of the features you would find in the field api.\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/0e400b65b86f02840ba045efbe5c21162c6b4c33/src/directives/formly-field.js#L36-L39\n. @jpuzzo Looks great.\n. @asadsahi did you try adding formlyConfig.extras.ngModelAttrsManipulatorPreferBound = false?\n. This seems to be a case of incorrect documentation.  The property should be formlyConfig.extras.ngModelAttrsManipulatorPreferUnbound = true.\n. I just submitted a change request on the docs.\n. Still has a typo ...\nAlso I think it should still remain as a feature.\n. @estaub check out this example http://angular-formly.com/#/example/advanced/nested-property-keys.  It This feature was added recently.\n. Is this for shiming the features of angular-1.3 with formly?\n. Sorry I was thinking of $validators.  That aside would this leverage $parsers and $formatters?\n. :+1:\n. > Any problem removing the default wrapper behavior? Basically, if you specify the name 'default' then it will wrap all types. This is a little bit too magical I think. And I believe it's undocumented.\nI would like that feature to stay.  I find it very useful especially when every field defines its own special things it is an easy way to extend types defined in a third party templates library.\n. I am against the change.  The reason being is that more implementation details now need to be known in order to know which object to place properties.  For example placeholder is an attribute normally placed on an element with a ngModel but doesn't have to be as is the case with ui-select.  Also you have said that required can be used for both ngRequired as well as in wrappers for styling.\nThe way my team uses it is we define types and the completely different teams build the forms.  So far the only issues we have run into has been around hide/hideExpression which make sense to be edge cases.\nIf this change goes through we will likely use the fieldTransform which is mentioned above.\n. How is this different than just setting ngModelAttrs with the different options?\nngModelAttrs: {\n  dateDisplayFormat: {\n    attribute: 'date-format',\n    bound: 'something-date-format'\n  }\n}\n. @prokilogrammer I override the  $scope.options.value in my controller or link if I want to define my own getterSetter.\n. I have an internal and an external representation of the input.  For example I have ui-select type.  ui-select requires an array of objects but the value I want stored on the formly model is the object's id or an array of ids.  The getterSetter handles that mapping for the type.\n. Please do not we currently use bower pretty heavily.\n. @kentcdodds we use wiredeps which leverages bower.json for our modules to inject the paths into several of our files.\n. @kentcdodds Where would you like the unit test placed?\nThe two places that make sense are formlyApiCheck.test.js  and formlyNgModelAttrsManipulator.test.js\n. @kentcdodds the issue with patching this is that the formController does not expose the array of controls.  There is some conventions that can be used to infer if a property on the form controller is a control.  https://github.com/ckniffen/angular.js/commit/e549f2d70c93ce402d781bc16b557b5950b2cbb3#diff-1838ed9bd28307b6d42de98549826ae5R304 uses controls which is a locally scoped variable.\nThe form could have all of its properties looped through and check every one that doest have a key that starts with $ checked for the some NgModel or FormController properties and then call $setSubmitted.\n. I am making some progress at getting my PR in for angular.  In the mean time I think something can be done in https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/1edd1058e9a42de912bf3df2f804bb525b61779e/src/directives/formly-form.js#L342\nSomething like\n``` javascript\nvar originalSetSubmitted = scope.theFormlyForm.$setSubmitted;\nscope.theFormlyForm.$setSubmitted = function(){\n  originalSetSubmitted();\nangular.forEach(parentForm, function(control){\n    if (control.$setSubmitted) {\n      control.$setSubmitted();\n    }\n  });\n}\n``\n. @kentcdodds @Bedo81 This is actually a problem with the example.  ui-select works with angular-1.4 and I currently use it with my project running 1.4.0.  The issue with the example is that theui-selectformly type is defined as extending the formly-bootstrap-templatesselecttype which defines a mapping forngOptionsinngModelAttrs.ngOptionsis not a valid directive as of 1.4 on anything other than aelement.  ui-select does not need that attribute so I just made it not extendselect`.  Only draw back is that it doesn't inherit the apiCheck.\nEx. http://jsbin.com/kohowax/2/edit?html,js,output\n. @astromac if you can create an example following the instructions found here.  I can better assist you.\nAlso try the following template. That might work because the id will automatically add id to the element with the ngModel on it in your template which would make the list attribute self referential.\n'<input class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" list=\"{{id}}_list\" ng-model=\"model[options.key]\" /><datalist id=\"{{id}}_list\"><option ng-repeat=\"value in to.options\" value=\"{{value.value}}</option></datalist>'\n. This issue is being closed in favor of formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap#54\n. @kentcdodds I thought there was ng-messages integration.\n. I feel like maybe this ticket should be moved to the formly website project.  As it is an enhancement request for an existing example.\n. I dont know if this fully applies but I wrote a utility to iterate over nested \"fields\".  I think it could be adapted to work with fieldGroups.\n```\nfunction iterateFields(fields, fn) {\n  _.each(fields, function(field) {\n    if(field.fields) {\n      iterateFields(field.fields, fn);\n      return;\n    }\nfn(field);\nif(field.templateOptions && field.templateOptions.fields) {\n  iterateFields(field.templateOptions.fields, fn);\n}\n\n});\n}\n``\n.

Unfortunately, listing a dependency both in dependencies and peerDependencies will mean that you won't get the warning if the dependencies conflict. Instead, the dependency will just be installed under your module.\n\nI just don't like the idea of forcing people to do something extra to consume my library, but in npm@3 the peerDeps wont be installed by default anymore so they'd have to install those deps themselves anyway.

Thanks.\nThe thing is it is possible that a \"hard coded\" traditional angular form would still be slow with so many fields being shown. But I do need to investigate this further. When all of the form fields groups are hidden except for one I still get a slow form for safari and ie9.\nI basically used ng-options so the models only update on blur and this made things much much better for the worst step of the form. But I did not think I would have to do this.\n. You can use ng-model options so that the value only updates on blur or after several milliseconds.\nYou can also try to remove the number o bindings in your templates (for example: I would have liked to have bindings to change the classes on the form so I can customise it to different uses but I can live without all that. Finally use one time binding for everything that can be one time binded.\nAdditionally you could divide the form into steps (there is an example of using angular form with a multistep wizard) so that you don't have all the watchers for the form active at the same time. The wizard being used in the example uses ng-show and you don't want this though. But it is simple enough to go into the source code and change it to use ng-if. Hope this helps.\n. Can't :( I really need to use ng-if because there are many dependencies and many fields hidden in the same step of the form.

Because then I could just say for these 3 fields I would use ng-show (because they are not even form fields, they are headers and they don't have many bindings).\n. These headers can appear in the middle of the form fields, that is one of the reasons I don't hardcode them. The second reason is that it is very appealing to have the entire form described in one JSON. Also because I intend to reuse as much as I can for future forms that are very different but have similar requirements, and I want to be able to build those forms very fast.\nBut is this hide thing a bug?\nAlso regarding what you said \"Note, obviously, you've got some serious performance considerations, so you may need to take things at a bit of a different approach. If you have a bunch of fields with their own hide conditions, instead of paying for a watcher for each of those, create your own watcher and respond to model changes yourself (by setting hide on the appropriate fields).\" You mean creating watchers outside of the JSON form configuration right?\n. hideExpression attribute would be nice thanks! I'm still going to think how I could do this with the existing mechanisms. One thing that comes to mind would be to have only one header instead of 3 and just change its text. It is less easy to configure and see, but it would probably work and I would have less watchers.\nRegarding what you said about the watcher instead of expressionProperties it would not help in my case because I'm not using the expressionProperties per field. For the step that can have more than 100 fields I put them inside groups and I only have the expressionProperties per group of fields (8 groups in total each group has many fields inside) not in every field. It is strange that I have performance issues and so many watchers (I used your awesome ng-stats lib to see this!) because I one time bind most things inside the fields. Also I ng-if the groups until they are necessary. Still on that step in the best case scenario I have 513 watchers (before the user starts interacting with the form and causing more fields to show up). Worst case I have more than 3000 watchers.

But that may just be me misunderstanding how compiling things works. \n@kentcdodds \u2014 It's not the compilation causing the problem here. You are resolving promises inside the link function, so you will always have to resolve n promises for n elements.\nWhat you can do is write code to queue promises and then call a digest after a certain timeout. So instead of resolving the promise in the link function, you would then send the promise to the queue.\nThe queue could be managed by a service or a controller in a surrounding directive.\nThen it would be a bit similar to how $httpProvider.useApplyAsync() works.\n. > What I don't understand is how putting those promises into a queue outside of the link function will prevent a $digest from being called after they are each resolved. The only thing I could think of to avoid that was to either use $$q or the native Promise (or a polyfill) and trying those didn't seem to make a difference.\nUsing native promises you can prevent Angular from doing a digest for every single promise (since it's happening outside the Angular world) and then perform a manual digest after a set amount of time.\nThis reduces the number of digest cycles. However, it will only speed things up if it is the digest cycle that is actually causing the problem since the amount of logic (to resolve the promises) remains the same.\nA normal timeline using $q:\n- resolve promise\n- digest\n- resolve promise\n- digest\n- resolve promise\n- digest\n- resolve promise\n- digest\n- ...\nWhen using a queued approach (using promises that don't trigger digest cycle automatically):\n- resolve promise\n- resolve promise\n- resolve promise\n- resolve promise\n- digest\n- ...\nSo if the digest cycle is causing the slowness, it will help since there are less digest cycles.\nIf it is the logic to resolve the promises, this will not provide any benefits, since there is an equal amount of logic to perform.\nHope that helps!\n. Quick update: just noticed that you use $http.get in getTemplate.\nSince $httpProvider.useApplyAsync(true) does not cause significant speed improvements, building your own queue will probably not provide any benefits either, unless you could make the interval a bit larger (I believe it is around 10ms with useApplyAsync).\nI'll see if I can add some timers to find out if it would help...\n. @gdi2290 \u2014 Sounds awesome!

I have created a plnkr that shows the milliseconds for every promise chain: http://plnkr.co/edit/fbbs2aHsPcLof3ENQnml?p=preview\n\n- each promise chain takes about 5ms on average on my macbook\n- useApplyAsync queues for about 10ms so that explains why it doesn't help much\n. @kentcdodds \u2014 From what I can see so far it takes the promise chain 5ms on average (see screenshot in previous comment) to complete.\nSo it will take on average:\n- 100ms to process form with 20 fields\n- 500ms to process form with 100 fields\n- 5000ms to process form with 1000 fields\nSo no matter what actions you take outside of the promise chain, these numbers are always going to be the minimum time needed to process the form unless you start changing the promise chain itself.\nIf you're interested in optimizing the chain itself, we can add timers for each function in the chain to see what is taking most time.\n.

    "a-laughlin": "Recently started looking at formly after it popped up on angular weekly.  Fantastic effort on demos and api docs!\nWhat about pipelines to start?  Angular uses them for validators, parsers, formatters, $http, etc.  They could contain functions that transform a presentation schema object into a presentation instance object, enabling custom transformations at any point.\nSo in the core, something like:\n```\nvar pipelinesToView = {\n  presentationSchema:[],// converts presentation schema (i.e., fields) into a custom object we can compile with the html\n  presentationInstance:[], // operates on the presentation Instance (for one-off change and performance);\n};\n// same principle from view to model, including validation, data cleanup, etc.\nvar pipelinesToModel = {}\n```\nThat would enable a lot of flexibility with a simple imperative API.  It would be possible to add plugins for things like 'repeat' by adding/removing functions in the pipelines.\nfor example:\nformly.addPlugin('repeater',function(pipelines){\n  pipelines.presentationSchema.push(\n    function repeater(presentationInstance){\n      // recursively walks over each part of the presentation schema as \"this\"\n      for(var i=0; i < this.repeats; i++){\n        presentationInstance.children.push(clone(this.children[0]))\n      }\n      return this;\n    }\n  );\n});\nCould go with html and controller like:\n```\n// html\n\n\n// controller\n$scope.model ={};\n$scope.presentationInstance = {};\n$scope.presentationSchema = {\n  fields:[{\n    key:'customField',\n    type:'text',\n    placeholder:'foo',\n    repeats:2  // <--- repeater would operate on this\n  }]\n};\n```\nDynamically appending pipeline functions would enable sophisticated conditions, though managing conflicts would need to be resolved\n$scope.presentationSchema = {\n  fields:[{\n    type:'button',\n    events:{\n      click:function(event,presentationInstance,pipelines){\n        if(presentationInstance.children > 2){\n          pipelines.presentationSchema.push(function(){\n            // add some conditional display logic\n          });\n          queuePipelineExecution();\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }]\n};\nThe same architecture would make it possible to implement something like the json schema in #147 by prepending transformations to the pipelines\nAnyway.  Getting late.  Thanks again for your work on Formly.  Hopefully this sparks some ideas!\n. It looks like it could potentially address both issues.  Examples would be fantastic.  I'll have more time to experiment with it this week.\nOne thing in the docs confuses me.  \"Allows you to modify/convert the fields before angular-formly handles them or validates them.\"  What does \"handles them\" mean?  It sounds like this function would run both pre-formatters and pre-parsers/validators.\n. Yes.  I added basic support for repeating models in a wrapper directive around formly in the angular-formly-simplified repo (based on your example).  Nested repeating models are more complex, so I didn't implement those.\nThe basic premise is that model is always an array, and if it isn't, make it one.  That's easier to reason about than array vs. object.\nI also started modifying the getFields function for preFields and postFields arrays, to add buttons that appear before and after the repeating models.  WIP.\n. +1\n. What's the purpose of having a single validators object currently?  If it's to keep things simple, I think the simplicity is lost when needing to add new properties to disambiguate between them.  Using the existing angular syntax seems the simplest and easiest to understand, since there's nothing new to learn:\njs\nvm.fields = [{\n  validators:{},\n  asyncValidators:{},\n}]\n. :+1:\n. Sure.  I'm already using it as a separate factory.  It's only 60 lines or so, but depends on lodash.  If formly exposed its functions to merge fields/templates/wrappers, etc., that could cut its size significantly and remove the lodash dependency.  I'd need to look more at what they're doing, but reverseDeepMerge sounds like it has potential.\n. Exposing methods not critical though.  Easy to just copy the necessary code.\n. I think that should work.  Let me talk with my team about it and get back with you.\n. Hey Kent.  Sure.  Go ahead and create the repo and I'll put in some initial code.  We can discuss/improve from there.\nAlso, formlyUtils already exposes reverseDeepMerge.  That'll help eliminate the lodash dependency.\n. In this code it looks like viewChangeListeners (including ngChange) will not fire if the model value === the parsers pipeline output.  I need to head out, but can run tests tomorrow.\n. And thanks for the quick response.  Definitely was feeling a bit frustrated earlier.  All good.\nAlso, trying to get a handle on how formy works internally.  Would I be correct in thinking that this behavior is the result of parser functions always returning the viewValue here?  If so, a fix that supports asynchronous validation seems like it would require setupWithParsers to return different values for sync and async.\nIf synchronous and...\n- valid, return viewValue\n- invalid, setValidity false and return undefined\nIf async and...\n- promise resolves, setViewValue()\n- promise rejects, setValidity false.\nDigest if necessary.\n. Howdy Kent,\nNormally, sure.  Since I'm behind on some deliverables due to spending time figuring that bug out, I think a better place to start with tests will be the simplified repo.  I still need to implement the fix for our code though, so I'm happy to implement a patch and post the code for it.\nAny conflicts you anticipate with the new parsers/formatters code?\n. After struggling to get setupWithParsers correctly triggering downstream actions this morning, and then spending a while trying to get some of the examples working after changing the script to angular 1.2 in the html, I decided to bite the bullet and go through migrating our codebase to 1.3.17.\nNever did get the downstream async actions running correctly.  Unless you know an easy solution for getting 1.2 async working with dependent downstream events, it might be worth re-opening the discussion about dropping 1.2 support.\nAnyway, here's the setupWithParsers function working correctly with synchronous validation (at least in my limited tests):\n``` js\nfunction setupWithParsers(validator, name, isAsync) {\n    var inFlightValidator = undefined;\n    ctrl.$parsers.unshift(function evalValidityOfParser(viewValue) {\n        var isValid = formlyUtil.formlyEval(scope, validator, ctrl.$modelValue, viewValue);\n        // In the next breaking change, rather than checking for isPromiseLike, it should just check for isAsync.\n        if (isAsync || isPromiseLike(isValid)) {\n            if (!isAsync) {\n                logAsyncValidatorsDeprecationNotice(validator, opts);\n            }\n            ctrl.$pending = ctrl.$pending || {};\n            ctrl.$pending[name] = true;\n            inFlightValidator = isValid;\n            isValid.then(function () {\n                if (inFlightValidator === isValid) {\n                    ctrl.$modelValue = viewValue;\n                    ctrl.$setValidity(name, true);\n                }\n            })'catch''finally';\n            return ctrl.$modelValue;\n        }\n    if(isValid){\n        ctrl.$setValidity(name, true);\n        return viewValue;\n    }\n    ctrl.$setValidity(name, false);\n    return ctrl.$modelValue;\n});\n\n}\n```\n.

Though I was hoping, since you indicate you use angular-upload, that you'd be able to quickly see what I may have messed up in my code. I didn't have any problem with angular-file-upload uploading the model, but it did have a problem with the angular digest cycle. Now, with angular-upload, the model isn't getting updated, so I'm at a standstill on my project. :(\n.

Can you take a look at my definition and tell me if I'm missing anything?\nIn my app.run method, I'm creating my custom object like so:\nformlyConfig.setType(\n{\n    name: 'licensefile',\n    extends: 'input',\n    defaultOptions: {\n        ngModelAttrs: {\n            multiple: {\n                bound: 'ng-multiple',\n                attribute: 'multiple'\n            },\n            accept: {\n                bound: 'ng-accept',\n                attribute: 'accept'\n            }\n        },\n        templateOptions: {\n            label: 'License File',\n            type: 'file',\n            required: true,\n            multiple: false,\n            accept: '*.lic'\n        },\n        validation: {\n            messages: {\n                required: function (viewValue, modelValue, scope) {\n                    //return scope.to.label + ' is required '\n                    return 'Please select a license file';\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\nIn my directive, I have this definition in my fields array:\n{\n   type: 'licensefile',\n   key: 'lfile',\n   templateOptions: {\n      focus: true,\n   }\n},\nI'm printing out the value of my model on the page, and I can see when I enter valid values into the other fields, but when I select a file, I get nothing.\nThanks for the great tool,\nMichael\n. Posted in the chat.angular-formly.com room. I couldn't find that room in Stackoverflow... should I ask a \"general\" question on stack, or is asking in chat.angular-formly.com enough?\nThanks Kent.\n. I'll post the question there, as well. Though I was hoping, since you indicate you use angular-upload, that you'd be able to quickly see what I may have messed up in my code. I didn't have any problem with angular-file-upload uploading the model, but it did have a problem with the angular digest cycle. Now, with angular-upload, the model isn't getting updated, so I'm at a standstill on my project. :(\n. Thanks, I ended up creating a non-formly form for the file upload, but I\u2019d rather keep everything in formly to be consistent. I\u2019ll give this a try and let you know. :)\nThanks again,\nMichael\n\nOn Aug 4, 2015, at 3:12 AM, Abdellatif Ait boudad notifications@github.com wrote:\nseems related to $watch I made a quick fix to make it work see my commit aitboudad@92cb0b5 https://github.com/aitboudad/angular-formly/commit/92cb0b5f91d5cac1c39dfeba55b3517732d428db but not sure if it can be added into angular-formly \\cc @kentcdodds https://github.com/kentcdodds\n. \n",

You would\nprobably add an onKeyup property to the field config and use that:\n{\n  type: 'datepicker',\n  onKeyup: function(event) {\n    if (event.which === 32) {\n      console.log('space typed!!');\n    }\n  }\n}\nThen angular-formly comes along and decides to add this to all fields, but\nmakes the function arguments different. Instead of passing the event, it\npasses the $viewValue or something. Or perhaps angular-formly processes\nyour field differently because that field exists. This would prevent you\nfrom upgrading until you refactored all of your fields.\nHopefully that makes sense and builds a case for the separation as well as\nthe use of api-check in this project. I force you to place your own stuff\nin either data or templateOptions and I let you have full reign over\nthose objects. Except in the case of templateOptions, there are\nproperties that angular-formly uses to do some of its magic. Which sort of\nreintroduces the original issue. Which is why I'm suggesting this change\nwould be worth the migration.\nDoes that make sense? Any holes in my logic? Is it not worth it?\nAsside from that, the templateOptions stuff is a little magical and is\nsomething that you must learn. It's not really intuitive. Something like\nngModelAttrs makes a lot of sense. You just think to yourself: \"What\nwould I normally put alongside the ng-model element, there's probably a\nproperty for that.\"\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/376#issuecomment-117229970\n.\n\n\nDawn M. Wolthuis\nTake and give some delight today\n. I'm using the \"after\" version, but why have a breaking change if you don't have to? It is very tempting to tidy things up, but it is a better habit to go out of the way not to have breaking changes. The examples could all look like the \"after\" and I see no problem keeping the \"before\" out of the documentation or indicating the user should consider it deprecated, unless there is a significant cost to keeping the \"before\" option around, why break existing code with the upgrade? \n. I'm curious why it would be better for the user (developer) to have to know\nboth the name of a \"parameter\" and the classification of it. Unless these\ntuples (templateOptions, ngModelAttrs) have optional cardinality > 1, why\nmake the user group them? If there are namespace type issues or the\ninternals need to separate them into groups to pass them to different\nprocessors, then a prefix should suffice. My suggestion would be to put\nthem all just one level deep (unless there are repeating groups). I will\ngrant that I am not giving a second of attention to the coding behind the\nscenes -- I'm just speaking as a user.\n--dawn\nOn Mon, Jun 29, 2015 at 9:30 PM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNot quite, but from a template author's perspective, you should hopefully\nhave just a few places to update things. Unfortunately, from a user's\nperspective, many field properties that used to live in templateOptions\nwould go to ngModelAttrs instead. As I said, I'd make a demonstration of\na fieldTransform that would allow you to make that transition over time,\nbut eventually you'd want to rewrite all of your field configuration\nobjects to resemble the new format.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/376#issuecomment-116916849\n.\n\n\nDawn M. Wolthuis\nTake and give some delight today\n. Yes, that does make sense. If all of the delivered attributes were \"at the\ntop\" and custom attributes had their own embedded tuple, that would\naccomplish things without the old-fashioned (but tried and true) use of\ndifferent prefixes, either for the delivered code (\"ng\" for example) or for\ncustom additions (I recall prefixes of \"x\" or \"z\").\nIf you further want us to grok that there are various types of attributes,\nprefixes can be used for that too. Requiring \"me\" to find not only the name\nof an attribute but the right classification to file it under seems\nunnecessary. I'll give you the name and you can file it in the right spot\nand process as needed.\nkey:\ntype:\ntoLabel:\ntoPlaceholder:\ncustomAttrs: {\n  myStuff:\n  namedWhatever:\n  toBecause:\n}\nMake the api easy for the developer and cling to backward compatibility and\ndevelopers will appreciate it.  --dawn\nOn Tue, Jun 30, 2015 at 10:32 AM, Kent C.

I understand how a nested model should look like, but unless there is no actual data, each property can stay null as long as their values (or their children's values) remain untouched. \nI am using a standard c# webapi backend with json.net serializer, which converts the mentioned empty js object to an empty (not null but instantiated) c# object.

Thanks, I already took the 2nd route, however because of the recursive nature of the problem (nested stuff), I was hesitant on performance implications and I do believe that kind of patching should be unnecessary. Hence I opened an issue to understand whether it is a fix needed on lib level.\nI can try to patch it as you suggest in your option 1, if we both (all) agree it's a lib level fix and no nasty side effects will arise.

Select United States again from the country drown down.\nNotice how the state drop down list now has 2 empty options. It goes away if you select an option. Any idea why this is happening?\n.

Ergo I'd need the parser/formatter framework to keep my model consistent. Of course I could go implement a directive but it felt like a better fit for this framework. Model transformation is a pretty common operation hence the support for a MV transformation framework being built as a part of angular core. Formly is essentially presenting a new interface (the old one being declarative HTML through the use of directives) to the form control features that angular supports but Formly doesn't give any interface to the formatters/parsers abstraction, which makes it an incomplete interface.\nFYI, atm I have an extra 'Editor' abstraction between my actual model and my formly model and this abstraction allows me to do transformations outside of the parser/formatter framework.\nPlease implement this, as I think it would bring your framework full circle wrt interfacing to angular form functionality.\nWRT the points you raised:\n1) I also think defaults should take higher precedence, i.e. they should go to the end\n2) I don't think you need to be able override parsers/formatters. It's a chain, and with defaults taking precedence, you can \"override\" by adding a formatter/parser later in the chain that transforms what the default chain segment gives you. If using a particular form custom type, there are certain characteristics that you should expect based on the contract provided by that form type, and it's these abstractions that you should be working with in your code. \nE.G. if your working with a \"date input\" type it might include default parsers and formatters to keep the model consistently a date object and the view consistently a string formatted as a 'fullDatetime'. If you wanted to customize that field type, eg, to change the format of the text rendered to the view, then you look at the interface documentation for the field and you know the new primitives to work with. I.E. to change the format, you need to either do the string munging manually, or better yet parse the new formatter primitive which is a 'fullDatetime' formatted string, then reformat the parsed string to your hearts content. On the other side, if you wanted to change the parsers chain, eg, maybe to add an offset to the date, the new primitive would be the date object that the contract that the \"date input\" field guarantees. If you need something outside of what the contract for the field guarantees, then you should make a new type all together or create a new abstraction where it makes sense. The field type should be immutable wrt it's contracts for the data interfaces.\nAnother potentially hairier issue is that if you try to override a part of an existing default chain segment then parts of that default chain segment might break since you might change the interface that a sub segment of that default chain segment expects.\nThanks for the great work on this library so far, and I hope you'll roll out this feature\n. WRT my expressed interest, I've already shipped the app with the workaround\nI mentioned and I've already moved on to a new app with a different stack\n(i.e. not a web app) so I don't have a harness or the time to set up a new\none atm so I can't test it atm.

On the other side, if you wanted to change the parsers chain, eg, maybe to add an offset to the date, the new primitive would be the date object that the contract that the \"date input\" field guarantees. If you need something outside of what the contract for the field guarantees, then you should make a new type all together or create a new abstraction where it makes sense. The field type should be immutable wrt it's contracts for the data interfaces.\nAnother potentially hairier issue is that if you try to override a part of an existing default chain segment then parts of that default chain segment might break since you might change the interface that a sub segment of that default chain segment expects.\nThanks for the great work on this library so far, and I hope you'll roll out this feature\n. WRT my expressed interest, I've already shipped the app with the workaround\nI mentioned and I've already moved on to a new app with a different stack\n(i.e. not a web app) so I don't have a harness or the time to set up a new\none atm so I can't test it atm. Your notes on the implementation are inline\nwith what I was expecting though, so for my 2 cents, it's a go. I do have\nanother app coming up where I might need to use this feature so I'll\ndefinitely be able to check it out then, and I'll submit a PR or two if I\nfind any issues.\nThanks for the quick implementation of the feature and I hope it'll come\nout of beta in time for me to use it in a couple months\nOn Mon, Jul 27, 2015 at 8:12 AM, Kent C. Dodds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHas anyone had a chance to validate that this works as you'd expect?

    "rmulder": "The only comment I have on this Kent - is that we are still working on migrating our code to be able to work on a version of formly beyond 6.13.1. The deprecation of support for 'hide' under expressionProperties and replacing it with hideExpression was not a straight-forward, one-to-one change as suggested (i.e., the function version) - and so has required us to refactor a bunch of code (we use server-side generated JSON), as we had depended heavily on that feature for hiding/showing certain elements based on certain user criteria.\nMy only concern with this change proposal is that there truly is a 'migration path' that works out of the box. Otherwise - developers may struggle to get their code updated while 'deadlines' are pressing on them, and therefore might be unable to take advantage of newer features for quite awhile. (Once bitten, twice shy)\nThis is truly an awesome library, but as an outsider recently pointed out to us - a library that is still very much 'under development'. While I cannot disagree in principle with the proposed change and the goal it seeks to achieve - I submit that the change itself would need to provide as painless an upgrade path as possible for those who are already heavily entrenched with previous versions of the library. You have 'sculptured' something that is truly a beautiful 'work of art' - and for that, as I'm sure my fellow developers would agree - we are truly grateful.\nTherefore I would vote that yes, it's important to get the API 'nailed down' so that the functionality it provides 'makes sense' going forward - but I suggest that it's more important as these types of changes are made, to provide a solid migration path/clear upgrade instructions for those already heavily using older version(s).\n. @kentcdodds No worries Kent. We just have data stored in rows that contain the 'field logic' for the application (i.e., a data-driven application). It just took time to track down all the locations we were using this hideExpression and convert them, as well as the server-side code doing the JSON generation, and then updating the client side/removing that dependency. I think it's pretty much been cleaned up by now, but just have to verify before doing the version upgrade.\nI guess I should have used wording other than 'under development'. I only meant that the project has been very actively evolving/changing (i.e., witness all of the version changes made in just the past few months) - not in a bad way per se, but that was just the observation made by an outside party that made my boss a bit 'nervous'. \nAs shown by the above rework required in our project, when an API is growing/changing like this, and you want to adopt the 'latest and greatest' - then there usually tends to be a little 'pain' involved in the upgrade process.

This looks good and legit workaround :) It will definately work in my case. I will try to come up with PR anyway as keeping original model reference might be a good feature anyway.\n. @psuedoSudo if you return $q.all(promises) at the moment of the return, promises variable will be equal to empty array thus anything that attaches itself with .then to the result of this function will be resolved at the moment of declaration with empty argument. This is because $timeout will wait for the next event loop to be executed and by then, $q.all([]) will already be resolved and anything you push to the promises array will be ignored. Correct me if I'm wrong please :)\n. /me pokes @kentcdodds \nI've added tests and refactored my code a bit to work with fields with custom model or relative model defined by string. How does it look now? I may add some docs as a cherry on top if you want to accept this feature.\n. I'm just not sure about my 'watcher grouping' magic. It seems to be working fine but I was wondering if it was so easy to implement why angular team didn't implement it globally in the core...\n. @kentcdodds it seems like a valid case, I have updated the PR to incorporate your suggestion\n. > We already have a mechanism for adding a watcher to a field\n@kentcdodds we don't, that's why I wanted to be able to add watchers through extras.watch.\nScenarios:\n- if you do not turn manualModelWatcher on you will end up with a deep model watcher.\n- if you switch 'manualModelWatcher' to true, the deep model watcher will not get created and you will be able to define number of custom watchers like [model.type, () => model.type, 'model.collection']. This way you do not have the overhead of watching whole model if you know that your form field should only react to couple of changes\n- if you define 'manualModelWatcher' as a function you can have additional form watcher that is not dependant on any field, for example manualModelWatcher: () => ctrl.loading but you still would like to define small watches on your fields just like on the second scenario\n. @kentcdodds ok this is a gamechanger... why did I even work on this if this was already available :ghost: \n. @kentcdodds OH WAIT! You have to manually define listener for each of these expressions in your implementation of watcher property. What I propose is that you just define expressions that should be checked to run the internal functions in formly. I do not need any callback for that. \nThese two seem to be similar but in fact do 2 different things.\n. @kentcdodds well, I might try but it will be more complicated. I however agree that adding extras.watch when we already have watcher property will be confusing for developers - 'which one should I use?' Worst case scenario we could rename extras.watch to extras.manualModelWatcher to make these two functionalities separate but that's a cheap trick :palm_tree: \nBtw your api is broken for a field with custom model and string expression in watcher. model in the expression will be referenced by the global model, not the one from your field. I fixed this case in my PR for my watchers by using $parse. \n. We could consider doing 2 things:\n- add watcher.runFieldExpressions property to single watcher from watcher array\n- empty listener watcher would not throw error if runFieldExpressions is set to true and expression is defined\nThis would mean that instead of:\n{\n  ...\n  extras: {\n    watch: ['model.type']\n  }\n}\nwe would have:\n{\n  ...\n  watcher: [{\n    expression: 'model.type',\n    runFieldExpressions: true\n  }]\n}\n\nThat said, this can be done but it may seem a bit confusing. It could be less confusing if runFieldExpressions would be true by default but this would mean that all the people that used watch expressions with listeners and did not expect them to run the field expressions will get field expressions running (this adds a bit of performance overhead but well... it isn't that bad of idea to run the field expressions on custom watchers).\nWIth that in mind we would end up with:\n{\n  ...\n  watcher: [{expression: 'model.type'}]\n}\n\nHOWEVER this still doesn't look right. For me, this watcher feature would seem to be overloaded with second functionality that doesn't quite fit in there. I'm wondering if mixing these two is a good idea and I'm even closer to saying that we should rename extras.watch to extras.manualModelWatcher and it will seem like a valid feature.\n@kentcdodds what do you think? I'm torn apart :) One way or the other, I'd like this feature pushed as soon as possible because it gives enormous boost to me app at work.\n. @kentcdodds ok, sounds fine however I talked with @skosno at work and he came up with other suggestion. He suggested that we could switch to watching just the expressions rather than specifying additional watcher. In that case simple field like\n{\n  key: 'type',\n  hideExpression: 'model.type === \"some-type\"'\n}\nwould require no additional work done if you disable the deep model watcher because it would watch the expression itself.\nOn the other hand, there are cases where specifying single watcher for all expression properties would be beneficial ie:\n{\n  key: 'type',\n  expressionProperties: {\n    'templateOptions.label': 'model.type + \" label\"',\n    'templateOptions.additionalOptions': 'data.getOptionsForType(model.type)',\n  },\n  hideExpression: 'model.type === data.someHeavyMethod()',\n  extras: {\n    manualModelWatcher: true\n  },\n  watcher: [{\n    expression: 'model.type',\n    runFieldExpressions: true\n  }]\n}\nIn this example we would disable expressions watchers for this field and just enable custom watchers that have runFieldExpressions: true.\nHow does it sound?\n. @kentcdodds that sounds fine, I will let you know when I'm ready\n. Ok @kentcdodds, I think I did it. However I went a little overboard so we might consider reverting one functionality but more on it later. Basically I did:\n- add optional manualModelWatcher to form config - it can be function or boolean - it disables global model watchers for that form\n- add optional watchAllExpressions to form config - when turned on, formly will add a deep watcher for each expression (templateExpressions and hideExpression). This option really makes sense only when manualModelWatcher is enabled but I didn't know how to validate it in apiCheck so we may let it be just optional or you may help me out with this conditional apiCheck validation\n- add optional runFieldExpressions to existing watcher functionality. If runFieldExpressions is enabled, it will run all field expressions after the watcher listener is finished. Also, now the listener property is optional due to fact that it can be omitted when runFieldExpressions is turned on. It could be validated in apiCheck but again, I didn't know how to do that.\n- renamed internal function refrencesCurrentlyWatchedModel to referencesCurrentlyWatchedModel - it had typeo\n- fixed hideExpression to be evaluated in the same model context that templateProperties are. This is breaking change but if you had nested or custom model on a field you had different evaluation context for basic expressionProperties (model referenced correct field model) and for hideExpression (model referenced always the model that was passed into form, not the one that the field defines). That being said, I can revert this if this is \"too much\" :)\nI have written some tests and smoke tested these features on my work project and it works fine.\nOn very complex page with numerous forms, it turned out I have 2 hideExpressions and 1 expressionProperty which takes around 0.05ms in total for each digest cycle :) Not bad I'd say.\n. @kentcdodds I know about that reason (however this is valid only when you ng-if the field when hide: true, it could work fine if you use ng-hide for that) but it's not about the scope, it's just about what the model property is referring to (idea seems simple enough and works fine). If you could take a look at this anyway and worst case scenario I change it back to what it was.\nexample:\nour model: {\n  game: 'scrabbles',\n  player: {\n    name: 'Karol',\n    type: 'casual'\n  }\n}\nThis is how it works in the current latest formly release:\n{\n  key: 'name',\n  model: 'model.player',\n  expressionProperties: {\n    'templateOptions.label': 'model.type + \" player name\"'\n  },\n  hideExpression: 'model.player.type === \"casual\"'\n}\nThis is how it works with my PR (notice model in hideExpression refers to model.player)\n{\n  key: 'name',\n  model: 'model.player',\n  expressionProperties: {\n    'templateOptions.label': 'model.type + \" player name\"'\n  },\n  hideExpression: 'model.type === \"casual\"'\n}\n. @kentcdodds the problem is that this object is used to evaluate the field.model itself so if I do:\nreturn {\n  model: field.model || $scope.model,\n  options: field,\n  index,\n  formState: $scope.options.formState,\n  formId: $scope.formId,\n}\nIt will evaluate the model the wrong way in initModel when field.model is a string. It seems that if I do:\nreturn {\n  model: angular.isObject(field.model) ? field.model : $scope.model,\n  options: field,\n  index,\n  formState: $scope.options.formState,\n  formId: $scope.formId,\n}\nit all works fine but it seems a little bit hacky to me... it would take $scope.model as a model until the field.model is initialized (if it is defined as a string). What do you think?\nAnyway, I will revert the fix for model property for now and I will leave this PR just with the watcher stuff and push the model fix in another PR when this gets accepted.\nHow does the code look to you besides of that issue?\n. @kentcdodds cool! When this is accepted I could prepare the fix for the model reference in hide expression and watchers.\n. Cool! :)\n. Hey @slavafomin, check out this thread to get the idea how to get around your issue https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/672\nYou can define custom watcher on a form that will evaluate expressionProperties or if you dont have model, then even better just set watchAllExpressions on form options to true and be done with it :)\n. Yeah @kentcdodds I've just edited the message :) it took me a while to prepare this PR and I noticed I didn't conform with commit message standard just after I pushed the PR.\n. @kentcdodds yeah sorry I'm just super busy right now :) You are right, I will refactor this piece of code when I get a chance and ping you afterwards\n. @kentcdodds I've updated this PR with some refactoring. Now field.model will always be initialized on initModel so we'll always have good model reference through field.model in form context.\n. cool, thanks @kentcdodds \nbtw any idea why the changelog is not getting automatically updated with new releases? https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/releases\nis there new changelog where such breaking change as the one here would be documented?\n. please provide some description next time :)\n. I prepared pull request #657 that fixes that issue, sorry for the inconvenience.\n@BarryThePenguin could you take a look?\n. LGTM if you have use case for it\n. @pcardune could you provide some short docs on your feature here? http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/formlyconfig (use suggest edit button in top right corner).\nAre you still maintaining these docs @kentcdodds? I should write some docs to the stuffed I pushed too I guess...\n. Well as to my knowledge, there are 2 separate watchers set up for hideExpressions - one on the global model, the one that you have firstName defined on and other for the subform and it watches only vm.model.address object. That said, only that second watcher fires hideExpressions on it's form so when you modify firstName the child form is not aware of that and does not fire any expressions.\nYou kind of hacked the hideExpression to use vm.model from the closure but you should probably only use arguments that hideExpression provides - then you would see that you cannot access firstName anyhow because your model is only vm.model.address.\nYou can however set up manual watcher on the child form and it will run the expressions when it changes:\n{\n  watcher: {\n    expression: function() {\n      return vm.model.firstName;\n    },\n    runFieldExpressions: true\n  }\n}\n. Yes, other than that you can specify not to use model watcher (which is expensive if your models weight a lot) and use form option watchAllExpressions and set it to true which will evaluate all expressions on each digest cycle. If you chose that, you can also try to disable the automatic model watcher which would be most likely redundant (set form option manualModelWatcher to true). That should do the trick also :)\n. @mhawila use options parameter documented in here http://docs.angular-formly.com/docs/formly-form\n. Hello, can you provide a fiddle for your case? There is only one place in the whole code where expression field.model || model is used and it never caused any troubles (so far).\n. Why would you want to set your model to null in any case? Model needs to be an object, it can be empty object like {} or Object.create(null) but never null because if you decide to put some property on it, you will not be able to because you cannot store any property on null. If you want to clear the model completely, use an empty object as replacement {}.\n. Well I'm not a fan of allowing null as a model - this will only cause hard to catch errors on any taken action. Putting null as a model and observing if errors are thrown is not a good way of debugging your code :) That said, your patch seems simple enough so I don't see a reason not to include it.\nI think we could use a second opinion here, anyone?\n. @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators second opinion anyone please?\n. LGTM\n. Looks good. I would even suggest to include this as default behavior.\n. I believe your plunker works properly. Parser will store the value as uppercase in the model. If you add another field to your html ex. <input ng-model=\"model.lastName\"> and try to write something there, you will see that your field in formly will receive uppercase value due to a formatter. \nYou probably expect the text to be uppercased in the formly field \"live\" when you write something but this is not the case here, parsers work on model when user enters some value through the input and formatters work when the model value changes. To achieve visually uppercase letters in the input use css text transform.. Thanks @kentcdodds for the idea however I cannot use data: {originalModel: vm.model} because I have my formly directive inside ng-repeat so my vm.model is array of models, not the exact model that I want.\nI will try to compose PR this week, however if you have other workaround I will gladly check if it could work for my case :)\n. This looks good and legit workaround :) It will definately work in my case. I will try to come up with PR anyway as keeping original model reference might be a good feature anyway.\n. @psuedoSudo if you return $q.all(promises) at the moment of the return, promises variable will be equal to empty array thus anything that attaches itself with .then to the result of this function will be resolved at the moment of declaration with empty argument. This is because $timeout will wait for the next event loop to be executed and by then, $q.all([]) will already be resolved and anything you push to the promises array will be ignored. Correct me if I'm wrong please :)\n. /me pokes @kentcdodds \nI've added tests and refactored my code a bit to work with fields with custom model or relative model defined by string.

    "BarryThePenguin": "Looks interesting, happy to have a go\n. I might add some more tests when I get time\nAnother thought I had was specifying fieldTransforms as a keyed object, that way you can have specific transforms applied to different fields...\n``` js\nformConfig.extras.fieldTransforms = {\n    transformOne: () => { },\n    transformTwo: () => { },\n};\n...\nfields = [{\n    name: 'one',\n    fieldTransforms: ['transformOne']\n}, {\n    name: 'two',\n    fieldTransforms: ['transformTwo']\n}]\n```\n. Hmm... I do have ghooks disabled (on Windows). Will look at it later. I'm in no hurry to get this merged, just happy to contribute\n. Thanks for the assistance! I'll try some feedback...\nI find structure really helpful, code style, contribution guidelines, have always been helpful when I've contributed to projects in the past. Since using formly and seeing first-timers-only gain momentum, it's only recently I've realised how helpful these ideas are for the community.\nUsing ghooks to run linting, tests, etc is really helpful. Saves all the nitpicking 'why did you add that tab/space/symbol/emoji'. Super beneficial. The downside is making it work in everyone's dev environment/setup. How can we improve that experience for people, especially when the node/npm world is so modular and projects have so many dependencies, for example commitizen/cz-cli#10.\nHow much hand-holding should there be? I think it's enough to reply to people's queries with a quick link or short description of where to find the solution. From what I've seen in Gitter, you do a good job.\nFrom this side of the world it looks like you're making good things. Look after yourself\n. - [x]  Go to this test and change it.skip to it.only\n- [x] Run $ npm test\n- [x] Notice that it's failing\n- [x] Go to this function, like Kent mentions above we should be using the $parse service to set the value.\n- [x] Once the test is passing, change the it.only to it so all the tests run.\n- [x] Make sure that all the tests pass\n- [x] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #468 (this issue) in your commit message (note it may take a second... it runs all the tests...)\n- [x] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR with the description mentioning issue #468 (this issue), get merged, celebrate :tada: \n.

Looks great @dfromero \nProof: http://output.jsbin.com/zejuhe \n. @kentcdodds happy to put my :hand::up: to contribute\n. 0.07% coverage increase!\n.

I stumbled across it after playing around with validateOnModelChange. I noticed $timeout was being used so I returned the promise. I'll have a look today to see if there's any other similar cases.\n. Cheers, it was just a cheap attempt to increase code coverage. But it gives us a place to put more tests in the future\n. Need to update api-check from master to latest\n//rawgit.com/kentcdodds/apiCheck.js/latest/dist/api-check.min.js\n. Apologies I never responded, haven't had a chance to look into it. Happy to leave this assigned to @kentcdodds \n. This is still occurring, even in 8.0.0\n. Thanks @psuedoSudo, that definitely gets us closer to a solution!\nI'm a little worried about modifying that promises array inside the forEach loop. Maybe we need to return a promise that is resolved after the $timeout and each of the fields have been set?\n. @psuedoSudo, if you put together a pull request we can get it reviewed and merged. If you need any help please let me know. If you @ me on gitter I can help out.\nI'm going to put together a solution too, just so I know what works \ud83d\udc4d \n. :clap: :tada: :balloon: \n. :+1: \n. It looks like this is a result of the validation being run before the fields are fully initialised.\nI'm looking through tests now and the field validation is being run before the formControl is added to the field. This prevents validateOnModelChange from running and validating the form on first render.\n. Hi! No, not yet. I managed to create a failing test for this scenario. Kent left some feedback on #603 but the solution hasn't been incorporated in a PR yet\n. This is just for hide expression yeah...\nWould it be possible to run expressionProperties after the field is compiled? That's what I'm trying to figure out\n. The problematic commit 28c648dc83cb75ded78e5d984a81cfd19c544e1c\nNow just trying to figure out what went wrong/how to restore it...\n. @kamilkisiela do you still have reference to 28c648dc83cb75ded78e5d984a81cfd19c544e1c, it looks like the branch referencing the commit was deleted, or was overwritten by a force push. Are you able to restore it?\nInstructions: https://help.github.com/articles/commit-exists-on-github-but-not-in-my-local-clone/\n. Either that or @kentcdodds will need to publish manually...\n. Sounds like it. The latest release on npm (7.5.0) has a gitHead of 28c648dc83cb75ded78e5d984a81cfd19c544e1c. That no longer exists in git history for some reason. So semantic-release falls over when it tries to compare all commits since that specific commit\n. Took a bit of messing around. But I think this is fixed now. Some release notes have gone missing. Anyway to build those manually? Anyone want to give it a go?\n. Looks like we got this sorted\n. It looks like this is an issue with formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap\nSpecifically where the first item from the template is appended to the description manipulator.\njs\nvar el = document.createElement('div');\nel.appendChild(angular.element(template)[0]);\n. Hi @JessyRiordan, can you see if this is fixed in the latest version?\n. Hi @k1ng440, is this fixed in the latest version?\n. I guess the only performance hit we're going to see is for people using nested objects. Looks fine, LGTM\n. @kwypchlo, are you able to look into this? I'm assuming it's related to the breaking change that was introduced in #639. It may be that it just needs to be documented a little more.\n. @melnac until this get's sorted you'll have to use a version before 8.0.0\n. According to @TheMcMurder jsbin above, it's available at https://npmcdn.com/angular-formly@7.5.2\n. This looks good now in 8.0.4. Thanks for your quick assistance @kwypchlo :runner: :dash: \n. Ok, looks good\n. Additionally if you have a field config like\njs\nreturn [{\n    key: 1,\n    type: 'input',\n    defaultValue: 'Hello!',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 0,\n    type: 'input',\n  }];\nBoth fields get updated, likewise if you change 0 to false\n. I'm guessing this was closed by #667 \n. Ah! Yeah. I think it's the glob argument in eslint, changing it to {test|mock} fixes the issue. Got dragged away last minute\n. Good job investigating. I'm thinking, is it worth having explicit type checking here? The problem isn't really key === 0, the problem is we aren't explicitly checking for undefined\n. Sorry, I'm on my phone so it's difficult to add detail :P\nI think the reason this issue exists is because we were checking implicitly for falsy values. Instead, I think the check should be more explicit, maybe checking for typeof undefined ~~and false~~.\nI don't think that checking explicitly for 0 makes our intentions clear.\nHope that makes sense. Though I'm happy to see this merged this either way. \n. Ignore false, that was a mistake. All that should be happening is an explicit check for undefined. In both cases the bellow should be suitable\njs\nif (angular.isUndefined(key) || angular.isUndefined(model)) {\n  return\n}\nThe original issue was an implicit check for key. What you have found and fixed is the fact that 0 was included in this implicit check. By explicitly checking for undefined, the issue is resolved and the code clearly explains what is happening.\nThis is a separate issue though... Thank you for your contribution!\nLGTM!\n. Awesome! I've been thinking of doing the same thing for a while now... If there's any tests in formly-form.test.js that don't have a compileAndDigest in them, would be good to seperate them into a different file too\n. Maybe even just a controller test file that is empty for now?\n. Depends what template you're using. Either way, you can specify your own template in your formly config. This is detailed in the documentation\n. This is normal behaviour for forms with a single field. It's detailed in the html specifications. Google will return quite a few people asking a similar question, along with a few different solutions. \nOne possible solution is to add a second, hidden, input field. \nAs this isn't specifically a formly issue, I'm going to close this. If you have any more questions, someone should be able to help out\n. Sure. I use form.$valid before submit.\nEither in the controller\njs\nvm.doSubmit = function() {\n    if (vm.form.$valid) {\n        alert('Submit');\n    }\n};\nor in the template\nhtml\n<formly-form ng-submit=\"vm.form.$valid && vm.doSubmit()\"></formly-form>\n. Might be worth pointing out what the specification says about implicit form submission.\nThe angular docs also talk a bit about form submission and the HTML specification.\n. I just a had a quick search through the angular github and found angular/angular.js#3205\nI'm not sure of an alternative to what I've already suggested sorry...\n. Do you know if this change solves either of the skipped tests in formly-field.test.js\n. Mocha uses test.skip\n. Hmm... ok, I just thought they would solve those skipped tests. Sounds like it's a little more involved then\n. Looks good. My only concern is there aren't any tests relying directly on this change. Should this be something to worry about?\n. Fantastic! That test fails before this PR and passes after, looks good to me\n/cc @formly-js/angular-formly-collaborators got any input?\n. Thanks again for your help @psuedoSudo\n. Looks interesting, happy to have a go\n. I might add some more tests when I get time\nAnother thought I had was specifying fieldTransforms as a keyed object, that way you can have specific transforms applied to different fields...\n``` js\nformConfig.extras.fieldTransforms = {\n    transformOne: () => { },\n    transformTwo: () => { },\n};\n...\nfields = [{\n    name: 'one',\n    fieldTransforms: ['transformOne']\n}, {\n    name: 'two',\n    fieldTransforms: ['transformTwo']\n}]\n```\n. Hmm... I do have ghooks disabled (on Windows). Will look at it later. I'm in no hurry to get this merged, just happy to contribute\n. Thanks for the assistance! I'll try some feedback...\nI find structure really helpful, code style, contribution guidelines, have always been helpful when I've contributed to projects in the past. Since using formly and seeing first-timers-only gain momentum, it's only recently I've realised how helpful these ideas are for the community.\nUsing ghooks to run linting, tests, etc is really helpful. Saves all the nitpicking 'why did you add that tab/space/symbol/emoji'. Super beneficial. The downside is making it work in everyone's dev environment/setup. How can we improve that experience for people, especially when the node/npm world is so modular and projects have so many dependencies, for example commitizen/cz-cli#10.\nHow much hand-holding should there be? I think it's enough to reply to people's queries with a quick link or short description of where to find the solution. From what I've seen in Gitter, you do a good job.\nFrom this side of the world it looks like you're making good things. Look after yourself\n. - [x]  Go to this test and change it.skip to it.only\n- [x] Run $ npm test\n- [x] Notice that it's failing\n- [x] Go to this function, like Kent mentions above we should be using the $parse service to set the value.\n- [x] Once the test is passing, change the it.only to it so all the tests run.\n- [x] Make sure that all the tests pass\n- [x] Commit your changes to the src/ directory mentioning issue #468 (this issue) in your commit message (note it may take a second... it runs all the tests...)\n- [x] Push your changes to your fork, create a PR with the description mentioning issue #468 (this issue), get merged, celebrate :tada: \n. TIL it.skip and it.only\n. Sorry! I've corrected that...\n. The plunker works now! Looks great @dfromero \nProof: http://output.jsbin.com/zejuhe \n. @kentcdodds happy to put my :hand::up: to contribute\n. 0.07% coverage increase!\n. The downside is:\n- formly.js increases 94KB :arrow_right: 103KB\n- formly.min.js increases 20KB :arrow_right: 38KB\nMy local build of formly.js\n. - coverage 92.80% :arrow_right: 93.01%\n- formly.js increases 94KB :arrow_right: 159KB\n- formly.min.js increases 20KB :arrow_right: 32KB\n+0.21% coverage increase for a +60% increase in file size...  :-1: \n. I stumbled across it after playing around with validateOnModelChange. I noticed $timeout was being used so I returned the promise. I'll have a look today to see if there's any other similar cases.\n. Cheers, it was just a cheap attempt to increase code coverage. But it gives us a place to put more tests in the future\n. Need to update api-check from master to latest\n//rawgit.com/kentcdodds/apiCheck.js/latest/dist/api-check.min.js\n. Apologies I never responded, haven't had a chance to look into it. Happy to leave this assigned to @kentcdodds \n. This is still occurring, even in 8.0.0\n. Thanks @psuedoSudo, that definitely gets us closer to a solution!\nI'm a little worried about modifying that promises array inside the forEach loop. Maybe we need to return a promise that is resolved after the $timeout and each of the fields have been set?\n. @psuedoSudo, if you put together a pull request we can get it reviewed and merged. If you need any help please let me know. If you @ me on gitter I can help out.\nI'm going to put together a solution too, just so I know what works \ud83d\udc4d \n. :clap: :tada: :balloon: \n. :+1: \n. It looks like this is a result of the validation being run before the fields are fully initialised.\nI'm looking through tests now and the field validation is being run before the formControl is added to the field. This prevents validateOnModelChange from running and validating the form on first render.\n. Hi! No, not yet. I managed to create a failing test for this scenario. Kent left some feedback on #603 but the solution hasn't been incorporated in a PR yet\n. This is just for hide expression yeah...\nWould it be possible to run expressionProperties after the field is compiled? That's what I'm trying to figure out\n. The problematic commit 28c648dc83cb75ded78e5d984a81cfd19c544e1c\nNow just trying to figure out what went wrong/how to restore it...\n. @kamilkisiela do you still have reference to 28c648dc83cb75ded78e5d984a81cfd19c544e1c, it looks like the branch referencing the commit was deleted, or was overwritten by a force push. Are you able to restore it?\nInstructions: https://help.github.com/articles/commit-exists-on-github-but-not-in-my-local-clone/\n. Either that or @kentcdodds will need to publish manually...\n. Sounds like it. The latest release on npm (7.5.0) has a gitHead of 28c648dc83cb75ded78e5d984a81cfd19c544e1c. That no longer exists in git history for some reason. So semantic-release falls over when it tries to compare all commits since that specific commit\n. Took a bit of messing around. But I think this is fixed now. Some release notes have gone missing. Anyway to build those manually? Anyone want to give it a go?\n. Looks like we got this sorted\n. It looks like this is an issue with formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap\nSpecifically where the first item from the template is appended to the description manipulator.\njs\nvar el = document.createElement('div');\nel.appendChild(angular.element(template)[0]);\n.

Please review the commit message convention. Thanks again!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Yeah, I think I have an easy fix solution\n. So this is actually more complex then it seems.\nThe test 'nested keys' is actually passing for the wrong reasons\nWhen this gets called\nconst secondField = {template: input, key: nestedArray, defaultValue}\n        scope.fields.push(secondField)\nthe nestedArray value is baz[0] which actually makes it so the model looks like this\nscope.model.baz.0 = value\nnot like this\nscope.model.baz[0] = value\nSo we need to figure out a way to dynamically set up a nested array.\n. Ok so I can fix the crash by putting this in\nif (/\\d/.test(key) && key.indexOf('[') !== -1) {\n        return model[key]\n      } else {\n        return $parse(key)(model)\n      } \nbut it wont fix the array issue.\nKent is this sufficient?\n. Ok just checked in a fix.\n. Thanks!\nAnd um...thanks to the second too, I think lol.\n. I have to admit I'm a little stumped on this one\nIf I do this..\nfunction shouldNotUseParseKey(key) {\n      return angular.isNumber(key) || (/^\\d/.test(key) && key.indexOf('[') === -1) || (key.indexOf('-') !== -1)\n    }\nThen this works\naddress-1st-line\nbut this doesn't\nb141c66a-2857-4196-847b-b2096fa6170d\nKent any ideas?\n. I don't think the second one ever worked.  Even with the original code\n. Danny sorry I stand corrected.  I pushed a change, that should fix it.\n. I think this is just an old merge.

Yes...but it's a touch hokey\nchange this\nvar watchExpression = watcher.expression || '$parse(\\'' + field.key + '\\')(model)';\nto this\nvar watchExpression = watcher.expression || '$parse(\\'' + field.key.split('.').join('\\'][\\'') + '\\')(model)';\n. Hey Kent, sorry it looks like I posted the wrong code.\nThis is my fix.  I tried it and it works locally\nvar watchExpression = watcher.expression || 'model[\\'' + field.key.split('.').join('\\'][\\'') + '\\']';\n. Done and Done.\n. Kent, can you verify that this is the test you want.\n``\nit(should add watches on deep dive fields`, () => {\n  const formWithOptions = ''\n  scope.model = {}\n  scope.options = {}\nconst deepLinkField = getNewField()\n  deepLinkField.key = 'foo.bar'\n  deepLinkField.watcher = {\n    listener: sinon.spy(),\n  }\nscope.fields = [deepLinkField]\n  compileAndDigest(formWithOptions)\n  expect(compileAndDigest).to.not.throw()\n  expect(deepLinkField.watcher.listener).to.have.been.called\n  scope.model[deepLinkField.key] = 'brown'\n  scope.$digest()\n  expect(compileAndDigest).to.not.throw()\n  expect(deepLinkField.watcher.listener).to.have.been.called\n})\n```\n.

Please review the commit message convention. Thanks again!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Yeah, I think I have an easy fix solution\n. So this is actually more complex then it seems.\nThe test 'nested keys' is actually passing for the wrong reasons\nWhen this gets called\nconst secondField = {template: input, key: nestedArray, defaultValue}\n        scope.fields.push(secondField)\nthe nestedArray value is baz[0] which actually makes it so the model looks like this\nscope.model.baz.0 = value\nnot like this\nscope.model.baz[0] = value\nSo we need to figure out a way to dynamically set up a nested array.\n. Ok so I can fix the crash by putting this in\nif (/\\d/.test(key) && key.indexOf('[') !== -1) {\n        return model[key]\n      } else {\n        return $parse(key)(model)\n      } \nbut it wont fix the array issue.\nKent is this sufficient?\n. Ok just checked in a fix.\n. Thanks!\nAnd um...thanks to the second too, I think lol.\n. I have to admit I'm a little stumped on this one\nIf I do this..\nfunction shouldNotUseParseKey(key) {\n      return angular.isNumber(key) || (/^\\d/.test(key) && key.indexOf('[') === -1) || (key.indexOf('-') !== -1)\n    }\nThen this works\naddress-1st-line\nbut this doesn't\nb141c66a-2857-4196-847b-b2096fa6170d\nKent any ideas?\n. I don't think the second one ever worked.  Even with the original code\n. Danny sorry I stand corrected.  I pushed a change, that should fix it.\n. I think this is just an old merge.  If you check the code the fix should be in there.\n. Sure no problem, will be in the future\n. ",

For example \n{\n                    key: \"textarea\",\n                    type: \"textarea\",\n                    className: \"col-xs-12\",\n                    templateOptions: {\n                        name_type:\"Textarea field\",\n                        code_type:\"textarea\",\n                        label: \"\",\n                        placeholder: \"\",\n                        required: false\n                    }\n                }\nFor example you can see properties     name_type and code_type are extra data for my own use. \nI insert  all these new data inside templateOptions propertie and it is working. \nIt does not intercept with the generation of the form because it formly ignores them.\nMy question is :\nIs there a specific or more appropriate variable in formly to insert this type of custom variables or is it correct as I am doing?  I ask it just in case\nThan you very much\n. ",
