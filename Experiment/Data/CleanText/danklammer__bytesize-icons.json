    "danklammer": "Reload icon has been added. Thanks for the feedback!\n. Thanks for doing this! I ended up creating one a little more consistent with the rest of the batch. Also, have it going clockwise since that seems more common. \n. @plainspace Good call! I added the .iconjar file to README under Design Files:\nhttps://github.com/danklammer/bytesize-icons#design-files\nI will also be adding a .sketch file there soon as well.\n. @Osifer This is a great idea! I ended up just using the SVG icon itself instead of adding images to the repo. This makes it a little easier to manage and one less thing to update if things change.\nMarkdown is pretty limited and this is a short-term solution. I plan on creating a separate landing page to make it easier to Copy and Paste soon.\n. @brandondurham Sure, feel free! I actually made a book icon but wasn't 100% sold on how it turned out. Maybe I'll still add it to the collection. http://jsbin.com/muzowu/edit?html,output\nhtml\n<svg id=\"i-book\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentcolor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\">\n    <path d=\"M16 7 C16 7 9 1 2 6 L2 28 C9 23 16 28 16 28 16 28 23 23 30 28 L30 6 C23 1 16 7 16 7 Z M16 7 L16 28\" />\n</svg>\n. Good call, @amilajack! Thanks.\n. @Nateowami Good points. While this project will remain under the MIT license for now, attribution is encouraged but not required.\nI added a line to the README to clarify.\n. @rhysd Looks pretty rad. Thanks!. @vanthome This has been added with the latest version.. Since you are rendering the SVG as an image you won't be able to manipulate fills or stroke from DOM.. @saboorazizi You can load the entire SVG library once (even as n external file for cache advantages), and use the  tag to show the icons you want. Demo:\nhttps://cdn.rawgit.com/danklammer/bytesize-icons/master/examples/bytesize-symbols.html\n<use xlink:href=\"/icons/bytesize-icons.svg#i-search\" />\nNote: This doesn't work for IE, so you'd you need to use a polyfill like SVG4Everybody:\nhttps://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody. Whoops. It's been updated. Thanks for addressing.. @qodo Added\u2014check release v1.3!. Still a work in progress, but you can use this:\nhttps://github.com/danklammer/bytesize-icons/blob/master/dist/icons/fullscreen.svg. Good idea! I will formally add this in a day or so, but here is something you can use now.\nhtml\n<svg class=\"i-filter\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentcolor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\">\n  <path d=\"M2 5 C2 5 6 3 16 3 26 3 30 5 30 5 L19 19 19 29 13 29 13 19Z\"></path>\n</svg>. I will be adding this in the next version.. @jhabdas Sorry for the delay. I do like this idea! I am exploring this for my next release.\nHere is one potential version:\nhtml\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" id=\"i-moon\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentcolor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\">\n    <circle fill=\"none\" cx=\"16\" cy=\"16\" r=\"14\" />\n    <path stroke-width=\"0\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M16 5 L16 27 C9 27 5 21.5 5 16 5 10.5 10 5 16 5Z\" />\n</svg>.

    "Osifer": "I Just figured there wasn't a way to add them in for some reason. So I turned them into a bunch of slices and went from there.\nSounds helpful.  :)\n. ",
    "amilajack": "This would be great!\n. @jlala Yes, it can be.\n. Yes, they can. Just use the svg's. You can make a component that takes the path of the svg.\n. ",
    "jlala": "hi! Can be used on native react?\n. ",
    "Nateowami": "@danklammer Thanks. That's a helpful change.\n. ",
    "ghost": "That line is known as the Notice Condition. If you're interested in understanding the MIT license Kyle's writing is worth your time. Here's an excerpt from the Warranty Disclaimer section:\n\nLawyers have long suffered under the delusion that writing anything in ALL-CAPS meets the conspicuous requirement. That isn\u2019t true.\n\n. Found a suitable replacement icon already bundled in the pack.\n\n. Or, combine both into a semicircle for a single icon\n\n. Looks absolutely fantastic and I'm looking forward to using it. Thanks, Dan.. ",
    "Fastidious": "OK, I found a way to do it. The trick is to use xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u201d, and I also base64 encode it. That works. Now I have run into another issue, which I believe it can\u2019t be fixed. It seems stroke=\u201ccurrentcolor\u201d will not work, the icon will be rendered black. Does anyone knows a way so that the icon will inherit the colour?. ",
    "saboorazizi": "Hi ! I am new to html, css and others, and I am sorry if my question is not appropriate.\nI search a lot to fine hoe could I load the SVG icons in to a CSS file and then use it in a project or a php file. I don't want to have the SVG tag inside my php or html tags. \nBefore I use glyphicon with bootstrap, inside a span tag. Can I load it in a span/id or class and the source should be out side of the file:\n<link href=\"../style/css/bytesize.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\nThank you!. ",
