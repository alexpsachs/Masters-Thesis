    "rmcardle": "Fixed in 1.67.\n. VncSharp may be a good alternative to ViewerX.  It was used in mRemote at one point before Felix switched to ViewerX.  A new version with quite a few bug fixes has been release since then.\nhttp://cdot.senecac.on.ca/projects/vncsharp/index.html\n. Fixed.  Will be in 1.62.\n. I changed some things in the code that might fix this problem. The changes will be included in version 1.63.\n. I have fixed this.  The fix will be in version 1.63.\n. Verified on both XP and 7.\n. Unfortunately, the focus issue will be very difficult to fix.  To fix it, I will have to replace PuTTY with a COM or .NET control.  I am debating whether it is worth it at this point.\nI have fixed the problem with moving and resizing mRemoteNG while a PuTTY connection is open.  This fix will be in version 1.63.\n. I can't replicate your problem guillem. Even if I could, these PuTTY focus problems can't be fixed without breaking the ability to move the mRemoteNG window while a PuTTY session is connected. This will all be fixed once we replace PuTTY.\n. This issue has been moved to JIRA.

Thank you for your contribution. I am wondering why users would want to disable CredSSP? Does it cause problems in certain scenarios?\nIf it really does need to be configurable, would it make more sense to have it be configurable at the connection level instead of globally?\n. Why would anyone want it disabled though? As far as I can tell, it doesn't cause problems and just works when it needs to.\n. I have implemented this as a configurable option at the connection level.\nhttps://github.com/rmcardle/mRemoteNG/commit/9a283e5da7e28a0600e2458a553f015e17193b2a\nThis change will be included in version 1.70.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Thanks for these contributions. These changes were included in 1.70.\n. Thanks for submitting this. I will include it in version 1.72.\n. Merged in commit https://github.com/rmcardle/mRemoteNG/commit/2db04225a7bea0b5389aef17e66457625a2a2d86\nWill be included in version 1.73 Beta 1.\n. MD5 has been compromised for years and should no longer be used. If you are going to use hashes for this purpose, you need to use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm. MD5 most definitely is not.\nCode signing using Authenticode is a much much better solution to this problem. Sign the individual executables and the installer package. Users can verify properly signed files right in Windows Explorer.\nTo be extra secure, publish the thumbprint of the signing certificate and instruct users how to verify it. You don't need to keep track of hashes for each file and each version you release, just the thumbprint for your signing certificate which will only change when your certificate expires.. The whole point of code signing is to verify file integrity. It is significantly more secure than even the best hash algorithm because it also verifies the origin of the code. Anyone can hash a file, only one or two people in the world should be able to sign it with your certificate.\nConsider the difference in difficulty between hacking your web server and changing the posted hash versus obtaining the private key for your certificate and hacking your web server and changing the posted thumbprint of your certificate.\nUsing hashes to verify file integrity is cumbersome, error prone, and insecure and should not be encouraged. Especially since a better solution is already in place.. Another point is that it would be significantly easier for a very determined attacker to compromise a user's copy of sha512sum.exe than it would be for them to compromise the Windows Authenticode system on a computer.\nIf users absolutely must verify the specific contents of a file (e.g. verify that this is version 1.1 not 1.0), you could use the Message Digest attribute in the Advanced tab of the Digital Signature Details dialog.. @sparerd Providing hashes, when there is a better, more secure system already in place, conditions users to rely on this outdated and insecure method of file verification. Users who don't understand Authenticode will just use the hash as their only authentication method and will be more vulnerable to attacks.. The reason this was using UTC is to ensure that the most recent backup is always the highest numbered. Using local time could cause this to not be the case if the time zone is changed, daylight savings time changes effect, or if multiple users in different time zones access the configuration file (some users share their configuration files on a server). I would recommend reverting this change.. ",

I think we have identified the issue now. One of the developers replied to my forum post on Sourceforge regarding this issue, his response is:\nI don't have an RDP server for testing, but with SSH2 I'm seeing a window focus bug in mRemoteNG. You can reproduce it even without KeePass: run mRemoteNG and connect to some server, run Windows Explorer and minimize it; now the mRemoteNG window should get focused again, but it doesn't.\n... so the issue I'm having seems to be related to window focus, perhaps this could be looked at?\nSource: https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/84e1d6d9/.

Yeah, this a great feature request. Like in Terminals there is an option 'Groups' that appear in the treeview where you can sort the connections.

    "clausjuhlp": "Well, does your INSERT colums match to number og VALUE clauses?\n. ",
    "NederWeb": "I had the same problem, in English ;-) the problem is that there are more values, then columns, in the INSERT clause, which happens because at the end, in SQL, the version of the configuration is also inserted. Somehow, the application used the language and region settings in Windows, to create the value for the version.\nLet me clarify, main version: 2, minor version: 3. Which is normally 2.3 so, the Application uses the Region settings, and in some country's, like mine, the , (comma) is being used as a decimal separator, and not the . (dot) which results in a \nVersion like 2,3\nSo the query will be like \nINSERT INTO table( Col1, Col2, Col3) Values('a', 'b', 2,3)\ninstead of:\nINSERT INTO table( Col1, Col2, Col3) Values('a', 'b', 2.3) \nSo, change this in the software, to not use the Region Setting in Windows and always produce a version like 2.3\nAs a workaround change the Regional Settings in Windows, to use a .

    "koalabear": "CTRL + TAB is already used in all major browsers to switch between the browser tabs. So I dont think this specific shortcut would be handy :)\n. But that would overrule the standard shortcut for the browsers?\nThen it should be a setting.\n. ",
    "nmat": "Actually this is why it would be good to have. Its a standard application setting for changing tabs so why shouldn't mRemoteNG use it?\n. I can replicate this. When the folders are expanded the search finds the results but not on collapsed folders.\nHowever in some cases its intermittent but it breaks the search filtering anyway.. This is one of the most used items I use to find a connection. What is the progress here?. In order to help you a bit more. Can you explain how the server is setup and also how you try to connect to it inside mremoteng?. is firewall set correctly? Is the server on static or dynamic ip? What does event viewer on server say?\nAlso is the service turned on correctly inside this pc -> properties -> remote settings?. Well the open in wiki might be better anyway.....so I will commit what I have now and then you can decide what to do with it :). @farosch agree....its better to have one place for all docs. One thing I am thinking about though is if its possible to translate that document in the wiki or if something like sphinx-doc, doxygen etc would be more suited.\nAlso on the same topic, API documentation might be good to be generated out from builds or so.. @farosch another good point is that not many know how to work with GIT or C# for that matter. So if you want someone to help with docs its easier for them to contribute if they are built auto and also if its straight forward only 1 language needed for documentation use. I got scared off a bit with the C# code and implementation that was in the help window at first. Took me a long time to figure things out a bit.. IMO working on what is in the pull request now is best and then the next step would be to move the help system over to sphinx-doc or something similar...therefore not taking to much time on \"fixing\" something that will not be used later. But move over to a new setup when time is right for next stable release.\nHow does that sound?. @sparerd I feel that I can't do much more right now with the docs on the current branch. Instead would like to continue with sphinx or something to get this more detailed in the future. \nThere are some areas where I need help to fill in the blanks and updates. If you feel that you can help please do.. Hmmmm shouldn't this be configurerable instead? For my eyes....it unfortunately gets cluttered in the top bar. :/. Oh I agree with the change. For me its easier with it at the bottom. So I am only thinking about if it could be configurable. :). IMO it makes more sense to be able to have the choice. I guess I am going for the \"dynamic\" part of it suiting everyones needs and wishes so to speak. Most people that have used mremoteng probably are mostly used to the search bar being at the bottom and so all of a sudden forced change might be...I don't know to much?. thats perfect! thank you!. One part here I could think is good also is the theming because it is not really working out that well. It \"works\" but also needs work in order to get it consistent and also for making it easier to work with.. Can you please explain what you are doing when trying to set the font in putty?\nPutty is a different type of tool that is being used. \nCan you also check this?\n Tools -> Options -> Advanced\n Press Launch Putty\n Under saved sessions select Default Settings\n Press Load\n Go to: Window -> Appearance\n And select the font\n Go back to: Session in putty window\n Select: Default Settings\n* Click on Save\nThen try to select the default setting in the connection you are doing in mRemoteNG and see if the font change.\nAs mentioned this is more of how putty works with sessions and that you need to save the font to the setting you want to use during the connection.\n. It is a bit hard to get started with how to help with translations I have to admit. Maybe this can be improved in some way. The above error seems to be coming from Zeta Resource Editor but in anyway....it is hard to understand how to get started with translations. . looks like you are using some insider version of windows 10?. looks like you are using a old version of mremoteng. Can you please try to use a later version and see if the problem occurs there also?. looks like its named: License.txt inside the installed release of mRemoteNG so on the computer it is placed in that path it seems. On the other hand.....it could just as well be placed inside Help folder that way it can be copied.. Removed. Changed. Changed to \"an indicator\". Crap....fixed. hahha thanks!. Changed thank you!. Ah yes....I forgot to fix the file linking after rename of files. (to be more organized source wise. Fixed now.

If so your tip with leaving the password empty could help - I'll try this after my next reboot of my box with \"fresh\" unused connections.\n.

Many times I am RDP'd to two different machines and it would be nice to be able to drag one of the machines into its own window so that I could display it on a different monitor. This would really be useful when configuring one machine to have similar settings to another machine. \n. Closing this one out... Primary efforts for removing magiclibrary have been completed by @jotatsu within the removemagiclib branch.. Fixed via #224 \n. @jcefoli agreed. Might make it user configurable or default to something reasonable for each session type.\n. @sparerd do we still want to do this? Or do we have enough page rules? It's a simple change, but we will need the page rule at least temporarily so that older versions will still work.\nI've copied the proper *.txt files over to gh-pages, so the update checks will still pull down the file in order to do the check assuming that update.mremoteng.org forwards to the gh-pages site.\n. @jumoog - Yes! Thanks! \nHowever, please also note, that we use ReSharper as well. We tend to do smaller changes while we're in the files doing other things.\nI have found that sometimes ReSharper will propose fixes and it will cause other problems despite build success and general run-ability of the resulting code. For example, some times adding the \"@\" to denote a literal string will cause the designer to throw an exception when trying to open that UI. Also, VS will just overwrite many of the changes to the Designer files.\n. Depends on #177 \nSince we need to update the schema version, this is the perfect time to add this as a newly configurable parameter. Scheduling for 1.75.\n. @jvitkauskas This code change shouldn't really do anything... if not focused, then it'll skip to line 91: InactiveHighlightBorderColor.\nYou code is valid... I'm just not sure what it is intended to fix? Could you please let me know the steps to reproduce and the problem that occurs?\n. PS - the jenkins build failure occurs because it didn't detect any changes... Likely because:\nif (Focused)\n  borderPen = new Pen(HighlightBorderColor);\nborderPen = new Pen(InactiveHighlightBorderColor);\nAND\nif (Focused)\n{\n    borderPen = new Pen(HighlightBorderColor);\n}\nelse\n{\n  borderPen = new Pen(InactiveHighlightBorderColor);\n}\nhave the same exact logic/control path.\n. That's what I got for reviewing code while all the kids are still awake and bothering me. I'll merge when I get home.\n. Fixed in commit: 6e3bfcdf04b8d43f12ca420381b4c9beb059d4ec\nRemoved unused code.\nThanks!\n. Hi Steph! We didn't forget about the JIRA bugs... Just haven't had the time to get to most of them. We are working them down as best we can! Slowly migrating to GH issues for better integration with other things that we're doing. Will get to this one ASAP. Thanks!\n. may be related to #168 & #166 \n. Schema was already increased to 2.6 - my error. This issue is invalid.\n. @mcarbonneaux \nThanks for the additional info. This is largely just a place holder at this time. We don't have any solid time frame as to when this could be implemented and due to various other factors, its unlikely that PuTTYNG will be removed (it just wouldn't be the default most likely).. @pedro2555 the plan would be to keep PuTTY for things not supported by SSH.NET, but make SSH.NET the default for SSH2.. @e-alfred at this time the solution is unknown. There are pros and cons to any approach.\nIf we integrate with an existing solution, there's less code for us to maintain. But this might not be an ideal user experience and there could be some security concerns with sending passwords on the command line that would be visible in taskmgr.\nIf we create a built in solution, this would likely provide the best user experience, at the expense of additional code maintenance and re-inventing the wheel.\nSo, ideally I think we need to look for a library that could handle all of the file transfer aspects and then we can create the UI on top if that. This is likely the best of both worlds. However, we need to ensure that the library is solid and well maintained since previously used libraries for the current (minimal) file transfer functionality were un-maintained/abandoned. . @peterchenadded That would be fantastic! Feel free to submit a pull request if you are able to do this:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md \nThis would be a perfect fit for some other planned changes that we want to include in 1.76 (see #338).. Closing this issue since HiDPI was implemented via #321 \nFeel free to reopen or open a new issue to report any other problems after 1.77 is released.. From MR-704:\nI had some SSH passwords with the symbol \u00b0 but they are not passed correctly to the SSH session and I had to type the password manually. \nFrom MR-621:\nsaved SSH password containing umlaut will not work\nWhen storing an SSH account's password that contains an umlaut, the automatic login would not work.\nIt is possible to successfully use it on the interactive login shell that appears after \"Access denied\". \n. @sparerd I'm good with this branch in its current form if you are...\n. @infectormp sorry for the delay... Could you clarify? How are you transferring the files (auto mapped drives via connection options perhaps)? Does just the RDP session hang? For example, does the rest of the mRemoteNG window respond? If you had another connection option, could you switch to it and used it effectively?. https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-717\n. @heyfrank No ETA at this time.\nAll releases leading up to the current 1.75.7005 were focused on stability with the occasional feature request where possible. The 1.76 release is getting a security focus.\nWhile this feature may possibly easy to implement, it may take some time to test. So we don't have it scheduled currently.\nReference API documentation: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817569(v=vs.85).aspx\nAdding tags for visibility in case anyone would want to give it a whirl and submit a Pull Request. Most changes would need to be in Connection.Protocol.RDP.cs. I would assume that these properties would also be useful:\nRemoteMonitorCount: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817567(v=vs.85).aspx\nRemoteMonitorLayoutMatchesLocal: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817568(v=vs.85).aspx\n. From https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-876:\nWhen exporting files from connection list you are asked to export items: Export Everything, Export currently selected folder, export currently selected object.\n- If selecting folder, does not export any contents of the folder and only folder itself.\n- If you have multiple connections in a single folder, cannot mass export and must export them one at a time. No ability to multi select connections in folder and export all those in a single export file. CTRL+Click and SHIFT+Click not accepted for multi select.\n- If you choose \"Everything\", export will create xml of the entire connection list including items above selected object int he hierarchy tree as well as below and in selected folder as well as all other folders on same level.\nExpected behavior would be to have \"everything\" export folder and all subfolders and connections in them but remain in the selected folder. If you choose the very most top level (connections) it would export all subfolders and connections. If you chose 1 level down, it would export that folder and all connection below it, staying inside of the original selected folder. \n. https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-977\nhttps://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-995\n. There is a workaround listed in #259. From #259:\n\nAllow embed Firefox(GeckoFx) to access SSL w/invalid certs in Remote Connection HTTPS\nManual fix to use your firefox exception SSL w/invalid certs:\nCopy:\nc:\\users%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles{RANDOM}\\cert_override.txt\nand place it here\nc:\\users%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Geckofx\\DefaultProfile\\cert_override.txt\nNote: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Cert_override.txt\n\ntentatively scheduled for 1.76. https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-672\nhttps://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-16\n. This is a desired feature, but the previous implementation in the unreleased 1.73 version (VB base code, C# keyboard handling library with ctrl+tab functionality) caused frequent crashes.  Currently no ETA on when we can look into this further - but we do understand the popularity of this request.. @patrikx3 As noted in my previous update - that particular feature was partially implemented and was very buggy. When @sparerd and I began working on mRemoteNG, it had not been maintained since Dec 2013. Since Feb 2016 (just over 1 year ago) we've made over 1,500 commits to the project. . @onurulusoy Sorry, but there is still no ETA. . @devon-z still no ETA on this. It will remain that way for the foreseeable future.\nThe project receives enough donations to pay the projects bills (code signing / SSL certs, continuous integration/delivery hosting, etc). It's at a healthy state last I spoke with @sparerd. It doesn't provide anywhere near enough to fund even a part-time dedicated developer. @sparerd do this on our free time (which unfortunately has been lack severely on my end at least).. This is different. See the quick connect panel at the bottom? That's missing. Basically once you hit enter from the quick connect text box in 1.72, that panel pops up with focus allowing you to tab to the connection type and hit enter again to connect. \nI just copied and pasted the description from JIRA. I'll update accordingly... \n. Scheduling for 1.76... @sparerd 's comments are accurate (I thought he was referring to something else initially). \nThe overall design of the quick connect toolbar changed where it added a dropdown menu to select the session type. This panel was purposefully removed. Though, I can see how this would be more desirable. \nAs @sparerd mentioned, we'll need to make some other design choices / options available to get the best of both worlds -- since the current dropdown menu is a very solid design, but not very intuitive for those that might rely more on keyboard input. . @pedro2555... This panel was remove for some different workflow in 1.73+ (what you see in the current UI). While I don't plan on putting back the same exact code/prompt, I was going to find a best of both worlds type of solution that would be more keyboard and mouse friendly.\nWhile the dropdown isn't bad, I can see the value in the panel. So (when I get around to this) the updated workflow would be more user friendly in either scenario.... After reviewing #708 further... I think this is the best solution here (and it doesn't require a new panel either)...\nThe new workflow is as follows:\n1. Type hostname\n1. Press tab\n1. Arrow down to select desired protocol\n1. Press enter\nWill be included in 1.76. Duplicate of #176 \n. JIRA ticket: https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-184\n. Export from JIRA:\nMR-184.docx\n. Someone attached code to a JIRA request: https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-1000\nThis was done before some of the code was changed to move away from TreeNode's - so we can't just check this in any more...\nOriginal and \"new\" file attached.\nLooks like mRemoteV1\\Config\\Serializers\\ActiveDirectoryDeserializer.cs and maybe mRemoteV1\\Config\\Import\\ActiveDirectoryImporter.cs will need to have the changed ported into them...\nCreated branch: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/tree/211_AD_Sub_OU_Import\nActiveDirectory.zip\n. Just to confirm... You'd like the tree to look like this on the AD import if you were starting at the DOMAIN level as listed below:\nDOMAIN\n\u2502   SERVER01\n\u2502   SERVER02    \n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500OU01\n\u2502   \u2502   SERVER03\n\u2502   \u2502   SERVER04\n\u2502   \u2502\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500OU02\n\u2502       \u2502   SERVER05\n\u2502       \u2502   SERVER06\n\u2502   \n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500OU03\n    \u2502   SERVER07\n    \u2502   SERVER08\nI'm pretty sure that I've got all the code ported over to the new and it pulls OU recursively. The tree that gets built seems to depend on how servers and OUs are named... So:\nDOMAIN\n\u2502   A-SERVER01\n\u2502   B-SERVER02    \n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500C-OU01\n\u2502   \u2502   A-SERVER03\n\u2502   \u2502   B-SERVER04\n\u2502   D-SERVER05\n\u2502   E-SERVER06   \n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500F-OU03\n    \u2502   SERVER07\n    \u2502   SERVER08\nWhere A-SERVER01, B-SERVER02, C-OU01, D-SERVER05, E-SERVER06 and F-OU03 are all at the same \"level\" within the tree, but imported in alphabetical order. The stuture is ultimately \"good\" and the OU nodes can be moved (to force them all to the top and any servers at the domain level will be under (UNDER, not WITHIN) the OU folders.\nI'd screenshot it, but I'd have to black out basically everything so it's kind of pointless.\n. hmm... It was working properly when I originally checked it in and tested... But I'm getting the same results as you now... I will look into this further.... I don't have a solid ETA, but this will be fixed prior to the next beta/release candidate - assuming it doesn't drive me nuts debugging it. I just haven't had the time yet... Hopefully at some point this week. Sorry for the delay.. @gentoouser - not sure what happened here or to your repo. I've seen it in the past when looking through other forks for other possible fixes/features that might not have been PR'd over. \nWe've migrated the entire code base over to C#. So even if you didn't close it out, we would have closed this PR since all that source is still under the old VB code.\nIf you're interested in contributing in C#, we'd love any further assistance! We don't have much in the way of \"formal\" contributing guidelines at the moment... But if you keep the PR's small that shouldn't be an issue. If you have something specific that you wanted to work on and want to discuss it first - log in to our Gitter chat: https://gitter.im/mRemoteNG/PublicChat \nTake a look at the open issues, and you'll see some of the direction that we are looking to take (looking to replace MagicDock for example).\nThanks in advance for any future contributions!\n. Reference: https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-253\n. Got for it! \ud83d\ude04 \nIf you're feeling especially limber, you could see about getting the htm file updated as well:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/develop/mRemoteV1/Resources/Help/SSHFileTransfer.htm\nThis would require a pull request...\n\ud83d\ude09 \nFeel free to discuss anything here and we will respond.\n@sparerd - did you open up the wiki for edits? https://help.github.com/articles/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis/. @countchappy Thanks for giving this a shot! See the following commit which added a different option for RDP session: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/commit/60cd2c2b128c64ff174ecfe8a3511de560390cdc\nThis should be a good guide for you to follow to add in the setting...\nFeel free to submit a pull request once you have it implemented and tested...\n@sparerd - assuming that countchappy submits a PR in the very near future, 1.75 would be a good release to add this to due to the updated confcons.xml schema... Thoughts?. @countchappy Glad that you're ready for that... Looks like you didn't create a fork.... so unfortunately you'll need to do a little finagling... \n\nFirst move your existing source tree to a different directory (mremoteng.old for example).\nGo to https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG and click the \"Fork\" link at the top. Some details on forks: https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/ - YOUR fork will be https://github.com/countchappy/mRemoteNG - that is what you will work with going forward\nCopy any files that you've modified from mremoteng.old to your \"current\" (fork created) mremoteng directory\nBuild and test\nCommit all confirmed/tested changes to your fork\nCreate the PR: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/. @sparerd \n\nDue to the changes you made in #157 - shouldn't we now be using FIPS acceptable algorithms? \nSo long as the environments don't require full FIPS compliant/validated applications - we could hypothetically change the prompt here:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/v1.75Hotfix8/mRemoteV1/App/CompatibilityChecker.cs#L23\nto add \"proceed at your own risk\" with OK or Exit buttons and get feedback from the community if this is acceptable. Seems like it should be based on the comments in this thread...\nI could create a pre-release build at some point this week most likely.\nFull disclosure: I haven't looked into this that much, so I don't know if I'm missing a big piece of the puzzle... \nThoughts?. @jsalian27 Not 100% sure if this will be \"fixed\" with my proposal. But it's a quick change that may work for a number of users - a good place to start with a minimal amount of code change. \nHopefully will have a pre-release build available this week. I'll likely build off of the existing 1.76 (stable) branch, so it will be considered a \"beta\" release for now.. 1.76.13 is an available pre-release for anyone that wants to test on FIPS enabled systems:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.76.13\nI tested on Windows 2016 with FIPS Enabled and connected successfully to another Windows 2016 system. Minimal, but it worked.. All,\nThanks for your feedback on this.\nI will get this code cleaned up and add a proper option so you're only prompted once (as opposed to on each startup). This will be released with 1.77 for sure... But if we have any plans for an official 1.76.* patch release (we don't at the moment), I'll be sure to get it included in there as well.. A better check was put in place and a new pre-release build is available:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.76.14\nThis will be included in any future final versions of 1.76 (though none are planned at the moment) and will of course be included in 1.77.. Closed at this is implemented in 1.77 (currently in the develop branch). Fixes #160 \n. Please see the troubleshooting and logging page.\nTry deleting the user.config, if that doesn't help, provide the information as noted.\n. No feedback received. Closing.. https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-52\nDescription:\nRelated to Options field: \"For empty Username, Password or Domain fields use:\" it would be useful to be able to use just user and no global password.\nThis is specially useful when the configuration is shared between users (shared file or SQL) and each person has it's own user so they would use this global option to fill in they're user. But when using SSH keys or if using different passwords for each machine, mremoteng is sending the empty password to SSH server and windows closes (since authentication fails). \n\nComment:\nActually this is even simpler to fix: if the global password is empty do not send it as empty password!\nThe same as regular password works: if there's no password ask for one on connection.\nMuch simpler. \n\nAppears to have been originally reported by @adrianandreias\n. Please see the troubleshooting and logging page and provide the information (logs and dumps) as noted.\n. Give this one a whirl... \nCode can be viewed here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/VncSharp/commit/2b94fe6a635e52cd1d6628314b905d146a99756a\nVncSharp.zip\n. @milanraf - any chance to test that binary? Did this resolve the problem?\n. @milanraf \nSorry... VncSharpNG was replaced with the standard \"upstream\" VncSharp library - trying to continue to contribute to other used Open Source projects where we can. This was done after the 1.74 release. So you'll need the latest 1.75 Alpha 3 in order to test that binary. They have been quite stable. Maybe try with the portable version so you don't impact your current installation?\n. @milanraf \nAre you able to try to test this in the current beta?\nYou can test this by running the portable version. Be sure to COPY your current confCons.xml into the extracted beta 1 portable directory, then replace the vncsharp.dll that I previously attached.\nIf you can validate this, then I can get the fix into beta 2.. @milanraf Sorry for the delay on this...\nAre you able to test this with the latest 1.75 beta 3 and the previously provided vncsharp.dll? If you are still expierening crashes with that combination, could you please provide me with the stack trace from the error/crash/event log message?\nThanks.\n. This requires further testing and validation. Not included in 1.75. Re-targeting for 1.76.. Fixed in commit d5d4fdefc8f7fa3be84afd3e2956f22f455c6358\nWill be included in 1.76. Can you attach the extApps.xml?\nPlease also attach the mRemoteNG.log\n. @dsstorm The log doesn't display properly for me since it appear to be in Russian. \nHowever, I was able to load your extApps.xml without any problems.\nI'm guessing that the messages in the mremoteng.log are mentioning about the differences in the config file format. You should be able to open the confCons.xml in mRemoteNG and then save it. That should put it into the new/correct format. Make sure you have a backup first.\nOnce that is done, close and reopen mRemoteNG and see if you are still having problems.\n. @dsstorm Could you please clarify what the problem is? Are you running into problems with external apps, or with connections?. 1.75 RC1 has been released. Please download and test if this problem has been resolved.. 1.75 final release will happen soon. No significant changes from 1.75 RC1. Should you still encounter problems, please reopen this bug report.. @sparerd Will do. Not sure if I'll get to fully review this until the weekend or early next week... But I will.\n. Will leave this open in case things change... But it's unlikely that we will implement this anytime soon. Efforts are more likely to be put into #181 \n. @tamirble I cannot reproduce this in the main window or with an RDP session open without redirect keys enabled. However, I can reproduce with a PuTTY session open. \nThis is likely because PuTTY is a separate app which we then integrate into the main Window.\nI haven't tested RDP with key redirection. But I would expect that if the RDP session was focused, the keys would be sent to the target session...\nThis most likely isn't going to be fixable with PuTTY in use. The solution would be to replace PuTTY: #181 \n. @tamirble Did you have a chance to look at my previous comment? Could you please confirm if you're experiencing the same results that I described?. While I've validated that Ctrl +A doesn't work... Every test that I've run proves that this is a moot point:\n- Right Click -> Rename\n- Single Click (to select/highlight) -> F2 (to rename)\n- Single Click (to select/highlight) -> Single Click (to rename)\nAll of these options have the same results: the name is completely selected by default. There is no need for Ctrl + A option is these scenarios. \nIn scenario 3 (2 single clicks) - this doesn't work 100% properly if the item is already selected. Since the item is already selected, there is no need for the 2nd click. In this case the first click will edit with everything selected. The 2nd click will cause you to effectively de-select everything and place the cursor.\nClosing this issue as the default functionality is superior.\n. That is correct... Some very minor bugs were picked up just after pushing out beta1. Fixed the website accordingly.  Keep an eye out for beta 1 soon! Thanks.\n. Depends on #155 \n. Implemented in develop branch due to changes from #155 . Possible fix checked in... Though, unable to reproduce. Unlikely that the log will have been written to. However, Please send in any crash dump info as noted on the wiki.\n. Closing per previous comment.. That's really weird... \nHelp - > about should show a tab with a close button for both the components check and the about window. That should allow you to close it. Or you can then drag the components check tab to re-place it accordingly. \nYou can also try view - > reset layout. But I don't think that impacts the components window. \nThis type of oddness will ultimately be fixed by #155\n. I'm not able to reproduce any of this... \ud83d\ude15 \n. @theWoodman Could you please provide the full text of the exception within the window?\n. @sparerd see of you can just build a new release based on my last commits. Just grab the mRemoteNG.exe's and attach them to this bug for validation... I moved the ica (and rdp) into a using. Thus may help. However... Now that I'm thinking about it more... Make sure the using is within the try block. I would think this would take care of it. \nIf you attach the eye's, one release portable and one release - not sure if anyone in this is reporting in a specific build... Anyone willing to test can rename the existing and replace with the updated one. Then we can issue a beta 2. Which will be a good test of the update checks. \n. Don't you wish we removed ica now? :smile:\n. @codedeep - closing this as a duplicate of #195 \nThanks so much for the workaround info. We're going to attempt to resolve this in 1.76 (but it may be pushed back to 1.77).. no longer able to reproduce. There were fixes in 1.76 - likely related to #1068. Closing. depends on #269 . Fixed via #671 - included in 1.76. Closing.. reopened #211 . What session types are you using? RDP? SSH?. Updated description for latest DPS release.... As @sparerd noted, CredSSP is already supported. We do support most RDP options allowed by the ActiveX client. \nIf there are any specific options that are needed / desired that we don't currently support via the config section, feel free to open new issues accordingly...\nHowever, allowing freeform would be asking for a lot of trouble since we'd have to validate all options passed in (from both a functionality and security point of view).\nThis request is not planned.. From user @vargasjj via #396 \nWhenever I tried to VNC to a TightVNC server that does not have a password set, I get:\n\nErrorMsg Opening connection failed!

No immediate plans. We're focusing on some securing and maintaining the code at the moment. In some cases that means adding features (like the credential manager that is being worked on for 1.76), but otherwise some of the added features were \"small\". This might be a bit larger. \n\nThough I also agree, it would be great to have. If we can squeak it into 1.76 maybe, but I'd likely say 1.77 at this point.. Closed via commit: a0303c70f9e908cdb3ff2cf769f9ad1de5574c42. Fixed the waffle.io link in the readme.\nOpened #288 for the forum since that will be slightly longer term. \n@sparerd You'll have to do the repo descriptions so we can close out this issue.. They aren't that active... Plus requires an additional account that people might forget about... kill the forum and redirect to reddit?. Or... https://www.prophpbb.com/. @sparerd The community has spoken! :wink:\nWe could have the subreddit setup today and DNS redirected fairly soon after.\nMigrating the old phpbb for historical purposes when they aren't super active and then maintaining them (even though prophpbb.com should make that easier for us) doesn't feel like the best use of our time to me either.... Agreed... Maybe:\n\nsetup the subreddit and link to that\npost announcement that reddit is the place new goto community\nSet the forum to read-only \nmigrate any necessary info to the wiki\nshut down in 3-6 months. I'm fine with 3-6 days... \ud83d\ude04 I can't imagine that there is that much applicable gold in there at this point.... @sparerd Sounds good to me!. Focus issues with PuTTY are known. \n\nThis most likely isn't going to be fixable with PuTTY in use. The solution would be to replace PuTTY: #181. Comment from @cusco  #520 \n\nHello all. I've searched on the internet and I find many people reporting this issue. On foruns and Jira, but I didn't find the issue here.\nAlso reports I found are old.\nBasically, when i have mRemoteNG opened with at least a putty session, I can't cycle correctly thorough windows applications with alt tab.\nHave mRemoteNG focused\n   Alt + Tab to another App -> stays on mRemoteNG (is it focusing putty?)\n   Alt + Tab again to another App -> stays on mRemoteNG (is it focusing back mRemoteNG ?)\n   Alt + Tab again (third time) to another App -> changes to the next app (say, browser)\n   Alt + Tab + Tab + Tab to yet another App -> changes to the 3rd App (say, skype)\n   Alt + Tab should go back to mRemoteNG but no. mRemoteNG stays in 3rd place\nAny window/app that I focus to, will then be always before mRemoteNG. Unless I click on the putty window inside mRemoteNG then I go back to the beginning.\nIs there a way to fix this annoying issue? Don't take me wrong, I enjoy mRemoteNG and have been using it for the past 3 years or so, but this is really annoying!. From @cryptage21 #663\nI've detected a bug with SSH sessions (Putty).\nAfter launching mRemoteNG, if you start a SSH connection, it's working perfectly.\nTo open a second connection, I click on the \"connections panel\" and when I want to write the name of the session, it's writing in the opened putty tab instead of selecting the name of the session in the list.\nAfter another click on the list, that's good. With 2 or more opened tabs, it's working correctly too.\nThe problem is only when there's only one putty session.\nCould you please check this issue ? I'm using mRemoteNG 1.75 Hotfix 8.. Related to #236 \n\nI was not able to replicate this either.\nLooking to add some messages into that area of code and running into a lot of funkyness (nullref's when clearly there are no nullrefs...).. 1.75 RC1 has been released. Please download and test if this problem has been resolved. If not, please post the mremoteng.log.. @infectormp This is working as designed. This is due to the fact that when the 2nd panel is added or removed and only 1 panel remains, the RDP resolution changes. The default option of fit to panel causes the disconnect/reconnect.\nThe same thing would happen if you resize the mRemoteNG window (and thus the RDP session).\nYou can avoid this by forcing the RDP session to be a specific resolution (potentially a bit smaller than the overall window size when both panels are open), or:\nTools -> Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Check \"Always show panel tabs\".\nThis will force the general tab to always be displayed. Then opening a new panel, the RDP sessions resolution will not change, and will not disconnect/reconnect.. @sparerd Damn. Beat me to it! by 39 seconds!. @infectormp You can reproduce the problem a few different ways as well...\nHelp -> About - this will open the \"About\" and \"General\" panels.... It's the height of the \"General\" panel, that adjusted the RDP resolution. It is quite small, but a change nonetheless. \nThe same will happen with:\n Tools -> External Tools\n Tools -> SSH File Transfer\n* Tools -> Port Scan\nThis might be something that we could possibly avoid in the future after replacing an old library that is in use for some of the tabs... This is already planned, but with no solid ETA: #155 . Details and Screenshots from https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-987\n\nWhen I open an SSH session, the screen is only 25% of what it should be. I need to minimize/maximize mremote to correct that. \nI've found out it's the putty windows size (lines, cols). It starts to small. I've changed the setting in putty to a larger default which helped for now. After resizing putty automatically changes the lines/cols\n\n\n\n. @archongtv great catch... If you you notice in my comment here the screenshots show the Team Viewer quick connection/share option in the title bar... This was also reported in #623.\nIt seems unlikely that we'll be able to do too much about this bug since MR is integrating the separate PuTTYNG process into its tab/window. I would assume that TV is attempting to stick it's icon on the PuTTYNG title bar as well (which is effectively hidden when opened via MR).. Being as this is not reproduceble (even when testing with TV) and some other PuTTYNG related windowing and overall tabbing changes included in 1.77, I'll be closing this one out.... Try deleting the user.config as @sparerd mentioned. If that doesn't help, we'll need the stack trace / crash dump to see what is going on.. Likely failed in the compatibility checker from the looks of things...\n```\nStartup.cs\nInitializeProgram()\n{\n...\nLogStartupData();\nCompatibilityChecker.CheckCompatibility();\n...\n}. @rsdan Your crash appears to be different.... You're getting an SEHException in the frmMain.InitializeComponent() method. This occurs a bit later in execution than InitializeProgram().\nThe SEHException is a bit odd/concerning as this could have been generated by \"unmanaged\" code. But I wasn't able to quickly find any smoking guns after a code review in that area.\nI've done some code cleanup and added some additional logging via a few commits as I've been reviewing this issue. Hopefully the next build we release will be better, or at least provide us some more info.. No solid ETA at this time. Likely not until the beginning of January though. It will likely be another beta or release candidate version. . 1.75 RC1 has been released. Please download and test if this problem has been resolved. If not, please post the updated stack trace.\n. 1.75 final release will happen soon. No significant changes from 1.75 RC1. Should you still encounter problems, please reopen this bug report.. Reference: https://sourceforge.net/p/objectlistview/bugs/108/\nSome bugs in the upstream code that could cause a nearly identical problem... However, those were resolved a few releases ago.... Reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/mRemoteNG/comments/5gzt28/shortcut/\n\nThe only way that I can think of to implement this would be to add a command line switch to open a specific connection. With a command line switch, a shortcut could be made to open that specific connection.. Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Check: Automatically try to reconnect when disconnected from server (RDP & ICA only)\n\nNot sure why that setting may have been turned off between versions though.... Tested in 1.75 Beta 3 portable... Printers do not appear to be redirected. However, I only have network printers available. RDP directly (mstsc) also did not redirect the network printers. Will need to review any limitations of this feature.\n@thedudeiii - could you please confirm if your printers are local or not? The option within mstsc specifically notes \"Local\" resources... I'm guessing network resources will not be available.. @jumoog efforts would likely be better spent implementing SSH.NET. If you look at #181 as well as a number of other report in our old JIRA bug tracker... The PuTTY integration is not 100% ideal and causes a number of usability issues. Most of the minor or just annoying. But all of them added up, including the security concerns makes for a non-ideal scenario...\nHowever.... With that said, we would gladly review (and likely accept) such a PR since:\n There is no ETA for implementing #181 (though it's high on our list)\n Even if we did implement #181 tomorrow, we wouldn't rip out PuTTY for a number of reasons - so this would keep it more secure immediately and going forward...\n@sparerd - do you have any further comments, suggestions?. I've listed this as an feature request... But in all honesty, I can't see us implementing this as its a bit out of the scope of the core functionality...\nHowever, I've left it open for future review. I can see us implementing similar functionality, but in a much smaller way, such moving the status light from config to somewhere more visible in the connection tree and then update that in the background at intervals (rather than on demand in the foreground).. I know of a number of users on Linux that would like this as well... I might finally make the switch to Linux as my main desktop if I could get mRemoteNG built and stable on it.... @KenLewis The good news is with .NET Core, mono and Xamarin Studio, building and running on Linux (and MacOS) is more possible than it was years ago... I did start to test this a while ago, but it was very unstable. In addition, it's unclear at this time if RDP will even work with the code as is since it requires the MS RDP client. It's very likely that additional code and/or components will be needed for this. The same goes for putty/ssh - it seems a bit inefficient to use putty when native ssh apps are available.... But as I said, the base app was very unstable and I wasn't able to even attempt connections.\nIf I recall correctly, I had more stability with WINE.. Crashes related to the user.config happen very early on in execution and are largely related to the .NET Framework itself. This is well outside of our control. \nAll of the user.config related code is all .NET Framework code:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397750(v=vs.110).aspx\nIf we were to maintain our own settings, this would require a very significant amount of code/time/effort and would likely destabilize the application in the short-term.. @Silent-Joker This is already planned and has some work on it in a branch: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/tree/MR-184_Credential_Manager\nReference #208 - Please upvote this Issue accordingly (for further comments and notifications).\nClosing this one as a duplicate.... Not sure how that happened... Looking back at past checkins... Will fix ASAP.. Working as designed. You'll need to change the option to %!PASSWORD%. Reference:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External%20Tools\n. \ud83d\ude04 Glad to get an easy one every now and then.... @youjenli There's no migration needed. 1.74 (the current final release) will load 1.72 version connection settings and well upgrade the file format automatically.\nYou may want to backup the confCons.xml just to be on the safe side however.... Start coding... :wink:. The DB handling code needs to be completely rewritten for multiple reasons. This being one of them...\nIdeally we'd also like to support at least one Free/Libre Open Source database rather than relaying on MS SQL.\nReference #182. I know that I've tested this in mRemote3G... But I'm also thinking that it's not as simple as just uncommenting the entries in the app.manifest.  For some reason I want to say that this caused some other unintended problems... I can't remember what they were of course... In any case, we'll see about doing this in the future towards the beginning of a dev cycle to flush out any bugs associated with it... Tentatively scheduled for 1.76.. @ravirxz - discussed this with @sparerd \nWe should be able to get a 1.77 alpha out by the end of February. \nIt's currently very stable, but we wanted to just clean up a few things before getting to that type of milestone. It's not feature complete for the full 1.77, but what is complete is solid save for a few remaining bugs that shouldn't be a major impact in an alpha. \nThanks for your patience and following up!. Duplicate of #196 . Hmm.... I thought I saw some other reports of similar problems, but with different RDP options...\nI'll look into this further. No ETA at this time.. Could you provide some more details about the external app being used?. The logs provided in your original comment (Killing/Dispose Int App Process failed!)relate to using an external tool that is (attempted) to be integrated into mremoteng... However, the TEST2 configuration you provided doesn't attempt to integrate...\nI tested the later scenario and didn't have any problems.\nRegardless, I did add in some additional protections for a problem that I ran into when my external tool configuration didn't exist properly. I also added in some better logging to help diagnose this further should none of of the other changes help the problem that you're running into... These will be included in the next beta build within the next few days/weeks (we haven't discussed the exact timeframe yet).. 99.9999% sure that I've fixed this. I was ultimately able to reproduce the errors listed in your original log.\nIn short, multiple calls to .Close() were happening. This is why we see duplicate/repeating messages. In addition, as part of the .Close() calls, we were attempting to go though cleanup code that is intended only for Integrated External apps. \nPrevented multiple .Close() calls and prevented getting into unnecessary code. Added some more clear log messages as well.. This was implemented in 1.76 via #558 \nClosing.. This one has me a bit stumped... \nAre you doing anything else at the time that the error has occurred?\nTry setting \"Automatic Resize\" to \"No\" and let me know the results.\nThanks.. It's unlikely that we'll be able to do anything about this... The click inside the RDP session is sent to the remote host and not processed locally at all... . I'm researching and testing a few ideas now... No promises though.... The \"problem\" is here (\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\UI\\Window\\ConnectionWindow.cs):\n```\n        protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                if (m.Msg == NativeMethods.WM_MOUSEACTIVATE)\n                {\n                    var selectedTab = TabController.SelectedTab;\n                    if (selectedTab == null) return;\n                    {\n                        var tabClientRectangle = selectedTab.RectangleToScreen(selectedTab.ClientRectangle);\n                        if (tabClientRectangle.Contains(MousePosition))\n                        {\n                            var interfaceControl = selectedTab.Tag as InterfaceControl;\n                            if (interfaceControl?.Info?.Protocol == ProtocolType.RDP)\n                            {\n                                interfaceControl.Protocol.Focus();\n                                return; // Do not pass to base class\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                Runtime.MessageCollector.AddExceptionMessage(\"UI.Window.Connection.WndProc() failed.\", ex);\n            }\n        base.WndProc(ref m);\n    }\n\n```\nBasically, we are capturing any WM_MOUSEACTIVATE message that is sent to the tab. This message also occurs when right clicking. Once we activate the tab, the focus is sent to the tab/RDP session.\nFor example, open an RDP session that has a notepad window focued within it. Type something. Leave the mRemoteNG window for something else, or go to a different session tab. Now return to the mRemoteNG window or the previous RDP session tab by CLICKING on the mRemoteNG window OR session tab. DO NOT click inside the RDP session. Start typing. The keyboard input should be shown within the RDP sessions notepad window.\nThere also don't seem to be any good events to trigger loss of focus for the contextmenu. Any not so good events that I've tried don't get triggered.\nI fear that any changes here will break RDP focus. But, this is a minor annoying problem. Let's leave this issue open in case anyone has better ideas.... FYI - confirmed that this still occurs in the current develop branch with the magiclib removal. Though, that's to be expected.... . I would advise against the SQL functionality for a few reasons:\n It's been in an \"experimental\" state for a very long time\n Assuming that you were to connect to a local SQL server, that's a lot of unnecessary required resources for a single user\n* Ideally, for your use case a SQLite DB would be more efficient\nThese are some things that are planned, but we have no ETA. Reference #182 . If you post the memory dump and Windows Error Report data, we can review it to see if there was anything related to mRemoteNG... However, mRemoteNG is a user mode application - there is no direct kernel hooks/access. It's highly unlikely that mRemoteNG is the cause of the blue screen. If anything there is an underlying component (.Net Framework, system call, etc) that is the cause of the crash.\nBeing that this is an insider build/beta, it's more likely that the problem is with Windows and not mRemoteNG.. I've setup a test VM out of curiosity... Just waiting for the fast build to be pushed out to me. @bdn02 @BrunoCrFr do either of you know how to speed up that process of getting the build?\n\n. Looks like there are multiple known issues with 15002 and MS released 15007 just 3 days after 15002... So I'm guessing 15002 was just a \"bad\" build.\nI wasn't able to get 15002 pushed to me and only received 15007 by the time I attempted to test this and the push actually started...\nNo problems with 15007. \nI'm going with my original assessment of OS problem.. @sparerd I think this would be a great feature for 1.76. Remove the milestone if you don't think it'll work for that timeline.... @strike5150 1.72 is quite old. You should update to at least 1.74, though the 1.75 beta3 is quite stable. \nYou can always save your connection file via Ctrl +S or File -> Save Connection file. Though External Tools could still run into the same problem that you described. \nWill leave this open as a feature request to implement auto save functionality.. Forgot about that one! \ud83d\ude09 \nI think we should look into an auto save feature to write any changes immediately for connections, external tools and the UI layout (and anything else that I might be missing that has an xml/config file). . Have you looked into Inheritance at all?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Folders-and-Inheritance. @sparerd Looks like the confCons.xml related tests are failing... Could you take a quick look at this PR if you have some time? Otherwise, I'll look at it next week most likely.... To make sure that I understand: Connections tree is set to autohide, but even after opening a connection, the tree is still visible until you move your mouse away from it?\nIf I'm not understanding properly... Could you please clarify, possibly with screen shots?. The next release will have a checksum posted. This was already planned/implemented.\nThis is the new \"update check file\" that we are working on:\nhttps://mremoteng.org/beta-update.txt\n@benwa - anyway that we can easily publish the checksum on https://mremoteng.org/download ?. Hmmm. Changelog.txt itself gets updated before the installer/zip is built since it is included in them. If we created some other file for gh-pages, would it be possible to read from it? . @michael-arion the checksums will be implmeneted in 1.75 beta 4 (or rc1, whatever we decide to call it) - which is the next release.\nupdate.txt and update-portable.txt are the \"stable\" builds and will be updated once we get to releasing the 1.75 final.\nWe will work on getting the checksum listed on the download pages - we're just discussing how to make it less manual for us going forward... :wink:\n. @rmcardle Thanks for the comments.\nAll released packages and binaries are Authenticode signed (unless otherwise noted in the release notes which was done a few times in the past for alpha releases - that practice has since been ceased). \nThe specific request here is about verifiable downloads/file integrity since that is a company required. It is a simple matter to provide MD5 hashes. Looking into your comments further for file integrity the concerns are minimal as an attacker would need to specifically craft 2 files to get the same checksum. However, still a concern and noted. It's also a simple matter to provide a SHA512 hash going forward.\n@michael-arion \nmRemoteNG-Installer-1.74.6023.15437.msi\nMD5: 6292A53A8282B1B81250BD0372FF75D7\nSHA512: AE6CC635684F5CC70DB445C248B55481D986E855358764E945A1D883615DB0194788B4AFA665F9583D3606089C98EBB3B32861A6FF39F5C7DAE058E3E7191D6B\nWill provide SHA512 going forward..

I'm mobile right now, but I'll post some external tool examples to the wiki later. \nThis is a popular request outside of external tools. It's low priority since external tools solve this very sufficiently. It will need to be discussed in the future. .

While convenient, I'm not so sure I want to support Chocolatey:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5g5npg/fosshub_message_for_chocolatey_please_stop_with/\nI'm not sure what the future implactions are if we were to create the Chocolatey package and link directly to the GitHub releases. At least currently since we're using GitHub for hosting our main website as well as source code, GitHub should be getting whatever they need out of our FLOSS project for revenue generation (additional traffic, self advertising/promotion for their paid services, possible sales leads, etc).\nGitHub is nice enough to give us all these great things for free. I'd hate to cause any undue costs for them by doing this.\nHowever, we'll leave this open for further/future discussions.. @rpg-hub For item 2, are you aware of any other software that makes this information available?

Can you test this in the 1.75 beta 3 (portable as to not mess up your current install)? I believe that we fixed a lot of casting problems between 1.74 and the current build... A number of them were attempting to cast ToolStripMenuItem (and others) as Control.\nOptionally, if you can provide me with the full stack trace (which should be available from the \"details\" button, or within the Windows Event Log, I can review the code a bit further to see if we missed any of these bad casts.... @pzi123 Thanks for the additional stack trace. That's exactly where I suspected it was as it seemed to be the last Control cast from what I could find. I was unable to reproduce the problem, but corrected the cast regardless.

Please keep it cordial folks. Thanks...\n@johnwc as @sparerd mentioned in previous comments (and I completely agree with him), I don't feel that implementing this directly in mRemoteNG would be the best solution for the product itself. I have dealt with organizations that have blacklisted applications for less.\nA plugin would be acceptable, but being as there's no ETA for #976 I did some additional research and found the following:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/17525377/how-to-use-inputsimulator-to-simulate-specific-keys-on-remote-desktop\nwhich links to http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/user32.keybd_event that has some additional details/code.\nWhile I haven't tested any of this, after a quick review it seems as if a simple c# console application could be written to send an innocuous key press every minute. You could then register that as an external tool, then right click on the session to kick it off. However, mRemoteNG would need to remain the focused window using this approach.\nside note: 2 minute idle -> forced logout sounds painful - you haven't been able to lobby for a modest increase to 5 minutes?

This will prevent the jenkins build failure.\nI'll see about getting this tested early this week (either later today, or at some point tomorrow).. @countchappy\nThe good news: I tested this. \nThe bad news: Windows on the remote host didn't detect my USB microphone or my builtin microphone. \nThe good/bad news: Neither did mstsc (\"good\" as in I don't think your code is broken).....

I saw that, but it looks like it was there... But it's also been a long day... I'm done... \ud83d\ude16 . No problem... \nMy only other thought (without having looked into it/testing it further at this point) - does Windows Server 2012 R2 (or any server version) accept microphone input even with mstsc? I'm provisioning a Windows 10 VM that I'll try to test with.... I didn't see any other Issues/Requests for this functionality, so closing this PR as Stale since it's been a while. Feel free to reopen/open a new issue/enhancement request accordingly.. @MartinY - could you please clarify this, and/or provide the exact sequence that you perform, the results and the expected/desired results? Possibly with annotated screen shots?. @sparerd - agreed.. Comment from #488 \n\nmRemoteNG is installed on multi user environement (Terminal Server with Citrix Xenapp 6.5 in this case).\nUser profile is configured to roam. In this configuration, appdata/local content will be deleted at logoff.\nOpening mRemoteNG, user.config stored (manually) in appdata/roamin will load correctly and all config are OK.\nIf you edit configuration using Tools/Options a new user.config is created in appdata/local (using running configuration parameters) and not in appdata/roaming.\nExisting user.config stored originally in appdata/roamin will not be updated.\nAt Operating System user logoff the file is deleted because all appdata/local and subfolders are discarded in TS environement with roaming profiles.. Tentatively scheduled for 1.76. @crfiemme \n\nWhile I haven't fully found the issue yet, most of these types of problems have code like this:\n```\nif !PORTABLE\n    public static readonly string SettingsPath = Do the non-portable thing;\n\nelse\n    public static readonly string SettingsPath = Do the portable thing;\n\nendif\n```\nSo the fix will likely be \"the same\" - or at least right next to each other. And best to handle this with the one bug to ensure that they are both fixed at the same time.. Reviewing this further, this might ultimately be resolved with #487 . Closing as this was merged via #951. Do you have Redirect -> Key Combinations set to yes in that connections config?\n\nMay the odds be ever in your favor. \ud83d\ude04 . I just loaded up 1.74 and it's there for me.\nPlease attach the mRemoteNG.log\nWhat OS are you running?. Can you click details and provide me with the info about the crash (copy and paste or screen shot - need the stack trace to review further)? As well as the mremoteng.log (if it gets generated)?\nThanks.. @sparerd Agreed. This one is annoying and we should get a quick fix out. I have some ideas on how to make some minimal changes to our release pipeline to make it easier for us to issue small updates like this.. The SQL code is in dire need of updates/maintenance/rewrites. Reference #182 \nThere's no ETA at this time when that work will begin.\nHave you attempted to share a read-only user? Did this work at all? Or did it generate errors?. Could you please clarify? \nAre you looking to switch between SSH tabs via a keyboard shortcut? If so, that feature doesn't currently exist. \nReference #196. The first thing that I would recommend is disabling \"Cache Bitmaps\" on all RDP sessions. This was known to use more memory and (in previous versions) limit the total number of RDP sessions that could be active at one time. \nIt's possible that lowing the resolution to 15-bit may help as well (without making it look noticeably different).\nAt 1.25 gigs and 8 RDP sessions, your looking at an average of 160mb per session. Which is higher than what I've see on my system. I'm running Windows 10 x64 with the latest .NET framework. While not required, you may want to ensure that you have the latest .NET framework installed in case there are better optimizations in the later versions...\nIn addition, as it's a .NET application, looking into some more user friendly ways to troubleshoot this, there might not really be much for us to do from a code perspective. This is pretty clear and informative:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/223283/net-exe-memory-footprint\nBeing as there were multiple complaints about memory usage on Reddit, we may need to do something better to debug these scenarios. This may require additional build options and/or tools to to be run on the problem systems.\nOne such option would require us to change the minimum framework version to 4.5 - which shouldn't be a problem for most people, but Windows 7 ships with 3.5 if I recall correctly. We currently require 4 (as we use some methods introduced in 4), so the added requirement for 4.5 would annoy some users... . @jcefoli noted and 100% valid points!  I think going to .net 4.5 might be the way to go, but I need to do a but more research. . Some great test results/details from another user reported via Gitter:\n\nI did some tests after reading about the RAM usage: it seems that connections to 2012r2 needs double the RAM than connections to 2008r2 (don't know why). In overall, 10 connections used 800MB. The same time my running Firefox with a bunch of open tabs used 1GB (!). Running RDP directly uses 270MB for only one connection to a 2012r2 server: i don't think that mremoteng has a memory problem... \n\nThere were some problems when making multiple connections to 2012+ systems that were resolved in 1.74:\nhttps://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-451\nhttps://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-582\nIt's highly unlikely that we'll be able to do much since we're using the MS libraries for making the RDP connections. But still there might be some minor optimizations that we can do (and should look into).\n. Closing this one out. Haven't seen or heard any other memory relating complaints in a while. All of my testing has been very reasonable. The current 4.6 .Net target (vs 4.0 when this was originally filed) includes Garbage Collection improvements.. Duplicate of #422 a new build will be released next week that includes the fix. . @countchappy Could you provide some more details in regards to the use case?\nThe only thing that I can think of would be to have multiple connections with the same hostname/IP, but different credentials. Would like to understand this better.. @TehDuffman - \"previously\" - could you narrow that down a bit? 1.74? 1.72? The huge change from 1.72 -> 1.74 was a C# conversion. From 1.74 ->1.75 the Connect Tree object type was changed. These are the 2 possibilities that I can see causing this type of a problem.\nThanks.... Tentatively scheduled for 1.76. I'm not able to reproduce this in the latest devlop branch.\nI was also unable to reproduce it with 1.75.7001\nCould you please confirm that you are on the latest (non-pre) release?. @TehDuffman Are you using the SQL feature also?. I believe that I've found the problems with the SQL code and submitted a change to @sparerd who is working on other SQL related changed.. Thanks @TehDuffman. \nPlease attach the mRemoteNG.log as well.. Some additional discussion points:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#Overview\n\nAnything earlier than .NET 4.5.2 is no longer supported by MS. \nThere were fixes/enhancements for HiDPI support which may benefit #321 \nAdditional fixes in 4.6.x releases for HiDPI as well\nAll current (4.5.2-4.6.2) frameworks are supported on Win 7 SP1 which is our minimum requirement currently. Fixed in commit 41e0228c03d2ffc852f4d03c8ced03ef5adbe436. @sparerd Anything thoughts on this one?. This crash is fixed in 1.75 hotfix 1 that was released yesterday. \n\nThe SQL feature is still experimental and is in need of a lot of TLC in the code. . Fixed in 1.75 hotfix1: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75Hotfix1\nClosing.. Are you using RDP or VNC connections? \nAre you using the smartsize option?\nTaking a screen shot wouldn't necessarily help at all since the cursor is generally hidden when using prtscn, however if you're able to some how record the screen, that might be helpful to show the problem.. This is expected to be fixed in 1.77 which has HiDPI support. Currently in the develop branch, Alpha release expected soon. Closing.. Tentatively scheduled for 1.77... But I've got an idea or two that I might be able to squeeze into 1.76 if the rest of it goes smoothly... . Superseded by #454 . @sparerd any thoughts on this one?. You have to set Redirect -> Key Combinations to yes and this will work.. That's part of the GeckoFx package. I don't run into those crashes. I don't think there's much we can do about that due to #357 / #439 . What version were you using previously?. @sparerd simple changes, but untested.\nSubmitting this PR against your resolve_sql_deserialization_issue branch for inclusion in the next potential 1.75 hotfix.. closing PR since this wont go into hotfix 3... The 436_load_coninfo_from_sql branch can be used for a hotfix 4 though... \ud83d\ude04 . Duplicate of #297 . The version of PuTTYNG provided in both 1.74 and 1.75 is the same: 0.67 - however they were signed at different times.

This was corrected in commit 30b37951b26257cd81d76887ceb007bd763afac7\n1.76 (or possibly a new 1.75 hotfix) will likely get a new PuTTYNG build of 0.68.\nHowever, regardless of the PuTTYNG versions, this appears to be an environment issue and NOT an mRemoteNG/PuTTYNG issue:\nhttp://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015165\nI've reproduced the character printing with BOTH 1.74 and 1.75 out of the box on a newly provisioned SLES 12 system.\nexport NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1 resolved by problem in both versions.\n.

So I guess that in theory would be the fix for this one?\nA better (read: more secure) implementation would be use the SecureString Class - or decrypt on USE (before needing the password for a connection or ext tool for example). This would keep the password encrypted in memory at all times.\nI didn't fully step through the code, but just did a semi-quick review and had these thoughts... Do you have any other ideas?. @sparerd I say merge #724 for now and we can work on the \"full\" fix for the next major release via #726 . Tentatively scheduled for 1.76 .

I made that typo in a few spots (the readme which I think I caught before I published, the tag name which is less visable to users, the release title)... Then I copied and pasted the typo and modified the HotFIx number without checking the little things like words and letters and stuff...\nI'm not a fan of \"hotfix\" anyways... Maybe we'll call the next one \"Patch 9\" and maybe I won't screw up the release name again. Maybe.\nSorry for the confusion... . @sparerd We'll have to discuss this further, but I think we might be better off trying to replace VncSharp with some sort of integrated UltraVNC build. That would be a large undertaking, but would gain other features as well.... Closing as duplicate of #573. \nWe should plan on replacing VncSharp with a bundled version of UVNC. .

However, I will say that it will be before (what is as of this writing) the 1.76 release. The 1.76 release has a huge feature (Credential Repository) which is a work in progress and requires a lot more work and testing before its ready for prime time....\n\nSo this PR will need to be merged into develop, then ported to the Patch9 branch that I'm working on. Rather than 1.75.7009, this will likely be renamed to 1.76 and 1.76 will get renamed to 1.77, etc... So sooner rather than later. I just don't have a solid timeline yet. I'll try to play less games and write more code at home (my 5yo insists that we save all Yoshi's friends in Woolly World). \ud83d\ude09 . @pedro2555 - yeah... this would be a nice feature. However since we would have the option to store vCenter credentionals, this type of implementation would have to wait until the develop branch is more stable (as it has a big focus on security)..

Once the build is completed I'll check in the binary to this repo and we'll be one step further. Still going to try to squeak out some more fixes for this release.. Do you have any more events in the application log which might show a stack trace?\nUnfortunately it looks like I don't have symbols for the 7008 binary so I can see the specific of the dump.

I wasn't able to get to it quick enough... . @mrwulf had some quick conversations with @sparerd. We're likely going to adjust some of our release plans slightly to get this merged in. We'll merge as soon as we can. Thanks for the PR!!!!. @mrwulf discussed this further with @sparerd \nI think there was a lot of users looking for this functionality and the code looks solid enough that we'd like to adjust our release schedule a bit...\nWould you mind resubmitting the PR aginst the patch9 branch?\nBasically patch9 (which was going to be 1.75.7009) will become the new 1.76 and 1.76 will be pushed back to a TBD version number. Patch9 will be going stable \"soon\".\nThanks again for the awesome PR!. Please see the troubleshooting and logging page.\nTry deleting the user.config, if that doesn't help, provide the information as noted.. When are you prompted for the password? When opening mRemoteNG or when attempting to connect to a host? \n@sparerd Any thoughts on this?. Sounds like you need to restore your conCons.xml from the last good backup and then restart mRemoteNG. Let us know if that allows it to start successfully.\nDo you know if you had any system crashes? A system crash/blue screen is the only thing that can think of that would likely corrupt both of these files. Unless you have other (very bad) disk issues.... @joao-garcia The zeroing out or corruption of files will likely be resolved when we write/save the configs on change: #340 . Do you have any specifics as to what exact actions you performed to cause this crash?\nThanks.. And what protocol did you have selected to import?\nCan  you attempt to reproduce the problem again, but take a screen shot of the port scan - feel free to block out the hostnames/IPs?. OK... After testing this a bit, it looks like the crash happens if NO folder is selected in the Connection tree. As a workaround, try clicking on the \"Connections\" icon at the top of the tree, a folder, or any existing connection. It should not crash. Looking into solutions now to be included in next patch.. @OmisNomis - The only one that I would expect to work based on the current design is Powershell ISE. The others are technically not graphical interfaces and Windows will likely not generate a handle for the UI for us to attach to. However, we are discussing some changes (see #710 if you're interested) that may allow some of them at least to make the attempt. Git Bash doesn't seem to get a MainWindowHandle assigned, so that one will not work even with the proposed changes and other bug fixes. cmd.exe does seem to work after disabling some checks, so \"final code\" may allow that one to work.. Looks like this isn't happening any more.\nOur release functionality is 100% provided by GitHub. The release link provided on mremoteng.org is the same as that on the release page.

Do you have existing connections? Do those function properly? Or is this a new install?\nPlease attach the mRemoteNG.log. Nope... I agree... It's annoying and we don't close other windows/tabs like this.... Still gearing up for the 1.77 release, but closing this one out so the changelog can be updated with all closed 1.77 tagged issues.. Other than Minimize -> Maximize or vice versa, any change in the window size of mRemoteNG will ultimately have resolution impacts on the RDP window. Depending on your connection settings, this could result in scaled appearance (smart size), reconnections (fit to panel) or scroll bars (specific resolutions).\nCould you provide some more details and/or screenshots?. This is just another scenario caused by focus issues with puttyng. See #290. Resolved via PR #705 . Honestly, I did look into this every so briefly. I'd like to to something similar to what Firefox does where the menu bar only appears if the alt key is pressed.. Do you have any more details about what lead up to the crash?\nPlease see the troubleshooting and logging page and provide the stack trace and mremoteng.log so I can review this further.. closing due to no response.. @jotatsu I've merged this PR.

Closing this one. Seems very likely to be a network/firewall/ISP issue.. Duplicate of #646\nAlready fixed, and will be included in the next patch. \nWorkaround:\n\nAfter testing this a bit, it looks like the crash happens if NO folder is selected in the Connection tree. As a workaround, try clicking on the \"Connections\" icon at the top of the tree, a folder, or any existing connection. It should not crash.. Reference #1202 - Further Citrix support is not planned. Closing.. Now that #414 is fixed in the portable version, we could fix this easily either with a quick change in PortableSettingsProvider - basically mimic what we do in SettingsFileInfo.cs:\n\npublic static string SettingsPath => Runtime.IsPortableEdition ? ExePath : Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData) + \"\\\\\" + Application.ProductName;\n. @pedro2555 \nCheck out the wiki here:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Development-Environment\n\n\nThe DLLs are part of the Citrix Receiver listed on that page.\n\n\nSo... This one is a little more difficult to answer since we we hit some minor scheduling problems... In general, develop... But for now if you want to submit anything against Patch9 that would likely be best...\n\n\nWhich branch were you working off of?\n\n\nFeel free to ping us on Gitter. I try to respond as quickly as I can on there - especially when I'm usually in front of a computer. :wink:. @pedro2555 \nThis is set in the post build event:\nset solutionDir=$(SolutionDir)\\\nset targetDir=%cd%\nset psScriptsDir=$(SolutionDir)Tools\n\nIt should resolve only during the post build step.\nHowever, I had just setup a new build env on my home system with VS 2017 Community and found some problems with some of the other postbuild steps. Take a look at my latest checking to the Patch9 branch and see if that resolves your problems.\nIf not, go to the \"output\" tab in VS and copy all of the build output:\n\nThe \"Errors List\" tab doesn't show all of the details and can sometimes be misleading.. You'll need to install the wixtoolset for the Installer projects to load. See the wiki. If that doesn't help, save the full text from the output window and attach it as a .txt file to this issue and I'll review further.. Please attach the mRemoteNG.log. The backup file generation is normal. \nIs mRemoteNG exiting normally? The confCons.xml is only saved at exit by default currently.\nYou could try Tools -> Options -> Connections -> Auto save every X minutes (set the value to something like 2-5 minutes).. Awesome! Thanks!. I think this is fine... But I'm going to give it more than a once over when I can to be extra sure. Thanks for the PR!. Thanks for the PR!. Thanks @jotatsu !!!!. We don't have any such feature on our radar at the moment..  I'm not 100% sure if we want to make this change in a patch release. Though I think it would be received well by the user base... So this one will likely sit open a bit longer I'm afraid.. Awesome! Thanks!!!. Looks similar to #645 are you sure your confCons.xml didn't get corrupted? Try restoring from one of the backups...\nAlso, once you're back up and running, you'll likely want to upgrade to the latest release:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75Hotfix8\nThis is much newer than what you are currently running.. @sparerd - I'm OK with this in general, but I don't think it should be the default. I think it would be good to have a checkbox (defaulted to checked is OK with me too) option in Tools -> Options -> Connections \nWe could change \"When closing connections\" from radio buttons to a drop down for space savings there.\nThoughts?. @pedro2555... @sparerd and I were discussing this one and reviewing it in relation to the original issue... Took us a little while to come to the conclusion that this is the best solution. :wink:\nIn that timeframe we had done a lot of refactoring. So I merged your modifications via the commit 75007db6305ce4f0808aa804df1e7c861f03a68f\nThanks again for the PR!. @pedro2555 I'm not comfortable with removing WaitForInputIdle as there could be other apps that this change breaks that we're not aware of. Reference Process.MainWindowHandle documentation\nThough, I think we should have our own configurable timeout rather than using Settings.Default.MaxPuttyWaitTime.\nI wasn't able to get GitBash to integrate as MainWindowHandle  == 0. cmd throws an exception on WaitForInputIdle:\nWaitForInputIdle failed.  This could be because the process does not have a graphical interface.\n\nI would assume Powershell and MinTTY would have the same problem (either MainWindowHandle == 0 or exception).\nIt's a bit of a hack, but... I wouldn't be opposed to a check before WaitForInputIdle that looks for known problem processes (like cmd.exe) and skips that check, but performs like a 500ms sleep on the thread before jumping into the while. We should log a message in that instance as well...\nWhat do you think?. Also... I think we should have some other tweaks:\nif (_handle.ToInt32() == 0)\n{\n    Thread.Sleep(1);\n}\nMight as well sleep for 1ms as opposed to 0ms... \ud83d\ude15 \nThen AFTER the while:\n````\nif (_handle.ToInt32() == 0)\n{\n    Runtime.MessageCollector.AddMessage(MessageClass.WarningMsg, \"Could not get window handle. Cannot integrate ExternalApp.\");\n    return false;\n}\nNativeMethods.SetParent(_handle, InterfaceControl.Handle);\n````. This is working as designed. Use:\n%!PASSWORD%\n\nReference documentation: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools. There's a lot of work needed to make the SQL feature reliable and secure. See #182 . @pedro2555 I can't reproduce this at all...\nMaybe set a break point in ConnectionTree.cs for RenameSelectedNode()? But since this UI element requires input, a breakpoint might not work so well... Log messages along the way to find out where the hang up is?. Leaving this open so we can review after #181 \nWe make minor customization to PuTTY and ship it as PuTTYNG - we don't have any plans at this time to further enhance or contribute to PuTTY directly. You may want to open a wishlist item with the upstream maintainer(s):\nhttps://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/. I don't see making such a change adding any value at this time. It's minor and I don't think there's been any confusion surrounding it as it is. Making the change at this time may cause more confusion.. I need to look at/test #704 a bit more.. Closing this one out since we're (hopefully) almost done with the AppVeyor implementation. . @sparerd Changes are simple enough, I think they are good to merge. \nI'll open a new issue for 1.76 to track implementing SecureString and only decrypt on use.. Seems like a duplicate of #297. Likely related to TeamViewer. This was not reproducible by the dev team (even with TeamViewer).. Closing since #763 was resolved and release.. Fixed via #760 \nThanks @brucetp. Duplicate of #573 - please upvote that issue for tracking.\nAlso reference #598 as this is similar.. Please attach the mRemoteNG.log\nAre you using the \"auto save\" feature? Tools -> Options -> Connections - Auto save every (is this set to a non-zero value - if so what value?)\nWhere do you store your confCons.xml? Default locations or on a network/shared/cloud drive?. Awesome! Thanks for the PR! Looks good. Merged!. increased button size by about 150%.\nChanging the text would require all translations to be updated also.... Current search implementation is not very robust. Reference #205 & #696. Could you please provide a screenshot?. closing - most likely \"Set hostname like display name when creating or renaming connections\" is enabled as noted by @sparerd . Did you make the changes to move the elements already? If so please submit a pull request! Looks like it should be straight forward and easy to accept/merge.\nIf not... I agree with your design suggestions and will look to include them soon.. Off the top of my head, I believe you are correct. These are newer ui components so we might have inadvertently skipped the localization bits. Will look to get them into the EN resource asap.. Still occurs with the current dockpanelsuite tags. Rather then an option, this should be the only way we save now. We should also remove the \"auto save every x minutes\" option.. I completely understand... I had that feeling as I was typing the comment. I think it's basically because the current save on exit or save at interval have been there forever. But... The default save on exit causes issues from time to time with zero'd out confCons - and save at interval is a band-aid for that. \nI think with this PR you've solved a long annoying problem and we should just move forward.\nHowever, if you still feel uneasy:\nMake save on edit the new default.\nSave every X could still be available. If this is enabled, then save on exit still needs to be enabled as well.. hmmm... Yeah, release note update would be good.\nConnection saves are async, so there shouldn't be any noticeable performance impacts... Or  do you think that we might lose data by queuing up changes?\nIf we think large connection files are more common place, this is would really increase the need to switch from xml to a DB (sqlite for local storage) - so maybe we leave this as is and going forward try to focus on #182 . will do!. Looks like items 3 & 4 no longer occur.\nItem 1 (panel for new connection is not populated): \n\nItem 2 (panel prompt for quick connection):\n\nThis is called from the constructor in ConnectionInfo.cs - so it should be set properly:\nprivate void SetTreeDisplayDefaults()\n        {\n            Name = Language.strNewConnection;\n            Description = Settings.Default.ConDefaultDescription;\n            Icon = Settings.Default.ConDefaultIcon;\n            Panel = Language.strGeneral;\n        }\nNot sure why it's empty - didn't have a chance to dig any further yet.... Value appears to be removed in DefaultConnectionInfo.Instance.SaveTo which is called from ConnectionTree.AddNode after the connectionInfo is properly created.\nI'm guessing that 52ad4435ac7177af929ade87ab6c5629c1ba32b0 caused this problem since \"Panel\" was removed as an excluded property.\nThat seems to have been moved into ConnectionInfo.cs in 35582a5e6aee078d3920e5a5c702de79a1df35ec\n@sparerd - mind taking a quick look since you did this fix... I don't want to just revert the change and lose the fix.. We DO default it to \"General\" but DefaultConnectionInfo.Instance.SaveTo removes that default.. Confirmed. Fixed in commits:\ne31088fd2ea13d9ef55397d9c9b09ee9259870d1\n1d7bb6371090d7eb0e413cd1d3d6cdcb8cd2b6d9. @farosch You make good points, but I think the icons as submitted are still lighter than the current ones and would likely still address that PR.... Would need to play with it a bit.\n@evilbaschdi Fantastic! Thanks!\nWould it be possible to adjust header.bmp and Logo.png to have the text bigger and make better use of the space? Also for Logo, I think we'd still like the \"Multi-Remote Next Generation\" tag line. @sparerd what do you think?\nCan you include any \"source\" files (psd, etc) within the PR?\n@sparerd If I recall correctly, we need .bmp's for the installer. It doesn't accept other image formats, correct? Otherwise I would say we should standardize on png except where an ico is required.. closing this PR in favor of #1232 which includes additional changes and source image files (PSDs).. Looks good... Thanks!\nWe would need the additional *.png files modified as well. Do you have any \"source\" files (PSD, etc)?\nI like both designs between this an #804. Both are modern and clean. \n@sparerd if we can get both PR's to include all necessary info to the point where they are both \"equal\" but different visually, I think we'll need do a poll and let our users decide on which icon set they like more.. Expected to be resolved in 1.77 which has HiDPI support.. @sparerd you are correct about the keyboard hook scenario... That specific crash has long been fixed.\n@sfantupetre dwmcore.dll is related to Windows Desktop Window Manager -- similar to the original reporting user in this issue, I suspect that your problem is more related to a graphics card driver than anything else.\nIf you can provide the full stack trace I might be able to provide a bit more info - this should be in the Windows Application Event Log:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\nHowever, I would also recommend that you update to the latest graphics card drivers for your system. @annawalker - same goes for you... \ud83d\ude09. https://mremoteng.org/download\nThanks!!. @amousa1968 We have minimal logging on by default. All our builds are \"release\" builds which don't include any debug information within the binaries.\nPlease provide the log so we can review further:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\nYou'll need to attach it directly to github - or CC: support@mremoteng.org in your reply.\nPlease also take some screen shots of your connection list - you can edit out the hostnames/etc - just want to get an idea of your folder structure and number of connections - not sure if that has anything to do with it... but my best guess based on the import related background.. Removed the bug label and milestone. This was confirmed to be a vendor issue and reported to MS accordingly (another HUGE thanks to @janis-veinbergs for testing/reporting/created proof of concept code).\nUsers of other applications (RDCMan and RoyalTS) also have the same problems.\nLeaving this open for now for tracking purposes, but there's not much else for us to do at this point.. Closing due to no additional feedback. #915 will likely help this scenario.. @sparerd - I'm OK with this change. Do you have any further thoughts?. Sorry for the delayed response on this. This is possible in all versions with Ctrl + Right Click in the PuTTYNG session.\nSince PuTTYNG is a separate process that is integrated into mRemoteNG's window, there's not much that we can do to put this menu in a more accessible location within mRemoteNG.. Closing as this is already implemented in the \"Set hostname like display name when creating or renaming connections\" option as noted by @sparerd . This will require the 64 bit build. Please follow #915 for further progress.. Looks like there is a way to do this, but it's a bit hacky:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003573/how-to-start-a-64-bit-process-from-a-32-bit-process\nBest to focus on 64 bit builds.... @sparerd I'm OK with dropping ICA and x86 - this would simplify the build environment...\nHowever, we need to replace MagicLibrary first as I can't find trusted source for this. Reference #155.\nI believe the rest of the libraries at this point are loaded from NuGet and have 64 bit builds so once #155 is taken care of, the rest of the work should be quick.. I'd rather have this in 1.77 than some of the other stuff... This will simplify things going forward and allow us to more easily get to some other bugs/enhancements by just having to detail with DockPanelSuite. . And by \"this\" I mean DPS only (no MagicLib) AND 64 bit build.. Related to #802 which has been fixed.. I've reproduced this as well.... Still occurs with 15.9.8. @sparerd - any other places that this needs to be implemented? In my review/testing, looks like most of them now include the hostname.... @seleky haven't heard back from you. Per @sparerd 's update, this is a problem with a missing prereq: \nPlease see the following FAQ for the solution to this problem:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#classnotreg\nclosing.. @sparerd Looks straightforward enough for 1.76 to me... Can we squeeze it in?. Reference #802 - This is effectively fixed for any new connections as the default panel name was not populated. \nFor existing connections you can update the config to set Panel accordingly. The default (in English locales) is \"General\".. When in the PuTTY setting, Load the \"Default Settings\" -> make you changes -> Save \"Default Settings\"\n\n. This was resolved with the replacement of magiclibrary via #155 and will be included in the 1.77 release - which will be alpha soon.\nEach panel now has it's own close button. No right click required:\n\n. closing as duplicate of #800. Open Task Manager -> Details -> Right click on the mRemoteNG.exe process -> Create Dump file. Attach the dump to the issue. \nAlso, please attach the mRemoteNG.log. If you have any cloud storage options available (Google Drive, etc) you can upload to there and share via e-mail to support@mremoteng.org\nhttps://nofile.io/ seems like it should do the trick as well, though I haven't found many reviews of this site (outside of one MakeUseOf post) and haven't used it personally (yet).\nOptionally, if you can attempt to zip it again using 7-Zip and use a .7z archive with LZMA2/ultra compression - that tends to get dump files down to a reasonable size. The attachment limit is 25mb. You may need to then rename to .zip or then add the .7z into a .zip file if the .7z is small enough to attach.\n. This was resolved with the replacement of magiclibrary via #155 and will be included in the 1.77 release - which will be alpha soon.. Hi All... Sorry for the delay on this one...\nI have some users that are local to me reporting similar problems as well. I was able to reproduce this also. \nJust tested on my Win10 1803 build - mstsc doesn't work either.  I would assume that MS patched mstsc, no?\nmRemoteNG uses the mstsc libraries that are on your system already - so if mRemoteNG is broken, it's very likely (in many scenarios) that mstsc is broken too...\nLooking into this further. . Per the MS doc, patched clients cannot connect to unpatched servers by default. \nAgain, mRemoteNG uses MS provided classes to make remote desktop connections. We have no control when they decide/need to change functionality like this.\nI've updated the wiki with full details here:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Prerequisites#credssp-updates-for-cve-2018-0886\nOptions are to:\n\nPatch the servers\nSet the policy to vulnerable\nUninstall KB4103727\n\nNot fun... But could have been worse, could have walked unto this problem on a Monday morning.\n@cjwxxx is correct regarding the solution/workaround, @chrvip is also correct about the fact that this leaves you vulnerable. However, this is the corner that MS has painted us into.\nUnfortunately there's nothing else for us to do from the mRemoteNG side. Closing this issue accordingly.. kb4093120 \"will enhance the error message that is presented when an updated client fails to connect to a server that has not been updated.\" The \"problem\" patch that addresses the CVE is KB4103727 for 1709 or KB4103721 for 1803 where the default has been changed to \"Mitigated\".\nDue to the way mRemoteNG is designed and works (it uses the MS RDP libraries), this is 100% a patching/vendor issue. There is nothing for the project to do in relation to this. The onus is 100% within the environments being connected from/to.\nSome other details can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/978#issuecomment-388376547\nOptions are to:\n\nPatch the servers accordingly\nSet the policy to vulnerable on the clients\nUninstall KB4103727 or KB4103721 accordingly from the clients\n\nSee https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886 for additional details about the CVE and/or the patches for the other supported Windows versions.\nThanks!. @Dgreyvenstein the scenario where rdp works and mremoteng doesn't is very rare. I would recommend that you open a new issue, post the exact error and mremoteng.log so we can review this further.. On the same page that @sparerd noted, check out the section about the crash on startup and the user.config file. \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @Jonathanhilluk \nWhat kind of connection are you attempting to duplicate? I cannot reproduce with RDP, SSH2 or HTTP. . FYI - I did a code review and didn't find any causes for this problem within the master (1.75) or develop (1.76) branches. \nPer MS:\n\nSituations in which AmbiguousMatchException occurs include the following:\n\n\nA type contains two indexed properties that have the same name but different numbers of parameters. To resolve the ambiguity, use an overload of the GetProperty method that specifies parameter types.\n\n\nA derived type declares a property that hides an inherited property with the same name, by using the new modifier (Shadows in Visual Basic). To resolve the ambiguity, use the GetProperty(String,\u2002BindingFlags) method overload and add the BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly flag to restrict the search to members that are not inherited.. closing as duplicate of #467. Options -> Connections -> When closing connections:\n\n\n\n\nBy default this is set to \"warn me when closing\". This will cause mRemoteNG to wait for user input (click OK to close all connections type prompt):\n\nIf you don't address it, mRemoteNG will remain open and have to be killed by windows on shutdown.. Can you validate that the mremoteng.exe process has exited (via task manager) after closing the UI?\nIf it's hanging, try generating a memory dump with procdump:\nprocdump -ma [mremoteng pid]. Any errors logged to the Windows Event Log? Does the [mRemoteNG.log](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging) get created?\n\n. @sparerd My Chinese is a little rusty... But I'm OK with this PR... \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for the PR!\nConnectionTreeWindow.cs changes should be removed - I don't think we're enforcing method naming conventions strictly at this time. This will fix one of the conflicts as well.\nLanguage.ru.resx_ needs to be removed.\nThanks again!. workaround is to install from command line with IGNOREPREREQUISITES=1option\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Installing. I can reproduce this, but I can't find any cause so far. Initial code review looks good and no reason why the menu would be changed. \nThe Help menu briefly disappears also...\nReally weird.... related to #981 perhaps?. Reference #802. Reproduced. Odd... \nSeems that once the application has focus, it can be dragged immediately. But if another application had focus, the 2nd times a charm.... We already have this:\n\nOr are you looking for something else? If so, please clarify.. This is a PuTTY native feature via Ctrl + Right Click -> Copy All to Clipboard. \nPuTTYNG (which is what we use/provide) is a minimally modified version of PuTTY and it includes the same functionality.. @BloodyIron There are a few themes available out of the box in 1.76 and further enhancements to this in 1.77. Also, you can create a custom theme. Does this resolve your problem?. Fixed Invalid casts in commit 793095900b3721efba2c0010087a45b022291819 via #1092. Could you please clarify? When I use disconnect on a folder, all active connections will be disconnected.\n\n. fixed in commit 793095900b3721efba2c0010087a45b022291819. This is working now in the \"removemagiclib\" branch that will be included in 1.77:\n\n. @sparerd I like my little Penguin icons and Windows logos currently, but I agree that it is difficult to see the connected icon that is overlayed. Maybe increasing the icon size (and proportionally increasing the overlay size).\nOr since we might not want to take away the custom icons as they are actively used:\nadd a second icon dedicated to the connection status (if possible)\nRather than an overlay, replace the custom icon with the connected icon\nJust some thoughts.... Do you mean \"/RestrictedAdmin\"?\nI don't see this command switch being exposed within the RDP methods based on my initial search:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/termserv/msrdpclient10notsafeforscripting\nAssuming that it's not exposed we would not be able to implement it.. Current builds target .Net 4.6:  https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Prerequisites\nYou should be good to go with Windows 10 out of the box:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed\nVersion 1.74 targeted .net 4. Version 1.75+ targets .net 4.6. .net 4.6 is included Windows 10. You shouldn't have to do anything other than install the latest stable release of mRemoteNG.\nOlder versions of Windows will require the .net framework to be updated and if on Windows 7 some KBs need to be applied as well (assuming that these aren't already on the system).. All exceptions in the log are from September and are likely from a corrupt confCons.xml:\n2018-09-25 21:27:16,460 [1] ERROR - Load From XML failed!\nUnexpected end of file while parsing Name has occurred.

This usually has the stack trace in in that will look a little bit like the one above.\nThe problem is highly unlikely to be in \"ntdll.dll\" as that's a system library which just happens to be the last thing done when the crash occurred (the top of the stack - the problem is usually a bit lower in the stack).. FYI - I was not able to reproduce this.\nI have 3 monitors: 2* DVI in a docking station and 1 HDMI plugged in directly to the laptop, setup as follows:\nHDMI DVI1 DVI2\nDVI1 is my main display.\nmRemoteNG is on HDMI.\nUnplug HDMI (literally unplug it - no undocking, etc), application is then moved to DVI1 accordingly.\nTested on 1.76.10 on Win 10 1809.. No worries. If you're able to narrow down the specific chain of events that cause the problem to reproduce the problem just reopen the issue. . Quick test...

Everything seems alright to me. Didn't realize I wanted the copy hostname feature until I saw this... :wink:\nI haven't tested the changes yet though. . @leaskovski Thanks for the PR!\nAs you should see, @sparerd merged this PR. The code is solid and we like the enhancement... The problem is we have a feature branch called \"RemoveMagicLib\" that is nearly ready to be merged into develop (see  #1258). This has been a long time in the making as there is no trusted source available for MagicLib and its been unmaintained for a very long time. #155 has been opened for a while and we're just getting to it.\nSo, I've merged the changed from develop into RemoveMagicLib, but I had to comment them out.\nWe'll need to comment on https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/559 and see if we can get a status on that issue, or any direction on how to remove the the tab strip in DPS so we can submit a quick PR. But we'll also make the case for having that PR accepted since we don't want to diverge from the upstream source. \nLeaving this issue open for now even though the PR was merged - since we'd like to get the functionality back now that connection tabs will be handled via DPS and not magic lib.\nThanks again!!!!. @DBonfini @stufently \nWould this be a good summary:\nStarting a PuTTY session from mRemoteNG with a non-English keyboard/layout causes PuTTY's text to be shifted to the left and makes the first few characters unreadable.\nStarting a PuTTY session with an English keyboard/layout doesn't have this problem.\n@sparerd \nAs 1.76.12 is released (even has preview), I'll be shifting this to the 1.77 milestone. We can re-prioritize this to any other 1.76.* big fix releases if they become planned.. I believe this this may have been fixed with #1265 when PuTTYNG only (other putty builds are not expected to integrate as cleanly).\nFeel free to test/validate with the build from appveyor (note that these builds are currently UNSIGNED binaries) - I would recommend testing the portable release unzipped into a different folder as to not impact your main installation or standard portable location:\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/nhd146cxy44y2x5x/artifacts/Release%2FmRemoteNG-Portable-1.77.0.3887.zip\n. @sparerd With the prereq fixes having been replaced multiple times over - maybe we should see about just doing a version check on the MSTSC client library rather than looking for the fix?\n@nicolasvahidzein Could you provide some more details? Screenshots?\nCheck %TEMP% for an MSI log. For example:\nC:\\Users[user name]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\MSI[random chars].LOG\n. Off the top of my head, you can Ctrl+ right click inside the SSH session itself to get the copy all menu. But this would be convenient to have on the connection tab.. This is pretty much what Inheritance does - setup a folder with all the details, then create a connection with just the hostname (generally the only thing that will be different).\nGive that a shot and see if that meets your needs. If not, please provide some additional details on how/where things can be improved.\nIt's possible that the scheduled Credential Manager functionality expected in 1.77 will also help in this regard.... Closing as duplicate. Please follow #853 for updates.. Off the top of my head, you can Ctrl+ right click inside the SSH session itself to get the copy all menu. But this would be convenient to have on the connection tab.. Closing as duplicate of #1189 . Installing the Citrix Receiver in Appveyor takes between ~1-3+ minutes for EACH configuration (Release, Release Portable, Release Installer) for every build request. This adds anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes for a build to complete in Appveyor.. The only thing that I can think of is maybe inheritance has been accidentally/incorrectly configured for this connection.\nMaybe change from always connect to warn or don't connect might provide a more specific error message?. \"An internal error has occurred\" is pretty generic.... Would you mind checking the event viewer (application log most likely, but possibly the system log) for any events that might coincide with a failed auto login?\nI don't think that an unisntall -> reinstall will help - but it's not likely to hurt either, just make sure that you back up your settings  and connections file.\nSounds more like a configuration issue with the one connection.

Merged. I just did some minor tweaks after testing. Also best attempt to cancel the scan - the pings get queued up so fast that canceling them isn't guaranteed. but with this change at least it looks like it gets cancelled and results won't be posted to the UI. Pings may still be running in the background until they complete however.. merged develop (which has magiclib removed) into this PR and fixed some minor conflicts. OK to merge now.. LoadSettings calls cboTheme_SelectionChangeCommitted which calls ColorMeList - which takes about 500ms in a debug build. But I don't see any way to speed that up.. @jotatsu Opened this issue for tracking... Currently using .Close(), but this could lead to handle leaks as the .Dispose() is needed... Not sure why this is only happening in the RemoveMagicLib branch.. OK... So it looks like when putty exits, were getting a deadlock between PuttyBase.ProcessExited and ConnectionTab.OnFormClosing.\n\nBut in this scenario, PuttyBase.ProcessExited is what ultimately triggers the form to close... Where the otherway around, the form closing (while putty is still running) causes PuttyBase.Close to call PuttyProcess.Kill()... So it's a bit of a different flow... Still looking into it.\n.

Resolved.. Resizing works. Fixed in c07e2e48d02813e960b131394dd11c7ac66bd7a2. @jcefoli I think the RDP disconnect might also be fixed in the above commit. At least, I can't reproduce it after that commit, but didn't test before it. Please let me know.... @jcefoli could you please clarify the external tools problem and/or provide a screen shot. In my testing (even in previous versions) external tools pane was added to the bottom and could then be relocated as desired. In the current branch it is visible and movable.\nThe magiclib removal should have impacted this since it's in a ToolStripContainer that gets added directly to the main panel - DPS and MagicLib aren't involved at that level.... @jcefoli I can't seem to reproduce the play icon issue. But the title bar isn't updating after the disconnect. That I've reproduced. Maybe after reviewing/fixing the title bar thing, the play icon overylay will be fixed for you (or I find a smoking gun in the code).\nI've also added a few more items to the list after reviewing the code and some of the other fixes that have already been implemented. \nThanks again for your testing and attention to detail on this branch!. screenshots implemented in edfbad2432b5dc20ac980187caa105a8c3ecec62. For the titlebar problem, FrmMain.Default.SelectedConnection = (ConnectionInfo) will need to be called from somewhere (haven't figured out where yet) so UpdateWindowTitle() is called accordingly.. We now have icons! 4ac51a7e582d1d4e437b6548b89a02e18716ce6d. double click to close implemented by @jotatsu as of 7603587ce3f55cbf13aa7043100a5445d031b6e4. Marking this one as done. Pretty sure we got to everything on the list. Please open new issues accordingly if you encounter any problems.. @jcefoli Opened this issue based on gitter chat.. hmmm... In earlier tests I ran debug builds outside of VS and the dispose still hung. But I haven't retested this in a bit. I'll do some more testing to confirm in both debug and release builds.\nThe only other thought that I have is possibly that the double close is the problem of the dispose - I'll look into the double close as well. . double close should be fixed now in f6a1d603a9ee0afaf167e0a159013fb096c0bd0b. @sparerd that logic is a little bit of a pain. I'll review it again... \nBasically since the Options form loads like 11 subforms, all forms options are processed/saved on OK.  \nThere seem to be a number of instances where changing the theme during runtime causes exceptions or incorrectly themed controls, so it's just safer/easier to force the restart for the (likely) seldom changed option.. @sparerd \nThe logic for the theme change detection is here:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/8bcd6b9e539a2bab4b92f3f2c22e24f834b01173/mRemoteV1/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/ThemePage.cs#L99\nBasically if the checkbox value or combo box value are different from what's in the saved settings, let the user know...\nYou could be running into problems depending on the theme that you have selected due to the theme renames.\nI've got an idea on how to handle the theme name changes with as little impact as possible - but still might have some users with problems... Again, minimal... I'll let you know. I'll take a look at these later if possible, otherwise tomorrow most likely.. doubleclick to find open connection fixed in commit 2f0550de8ea715267dab7ad886d251485012357d. single click options function properly now - likely due to 2f0550de8ea715267dab7ad886d251485012357d. >when components check is run at startup the form is somehow wierdly docked which causes strange behavior later on.\nCould you clarify? I'm not seeing any issues with this...\n\nputty panel not fitted into window (you can drag it around like a mdichild)\n\nThis has happened in the past without DPS as well... But will review further...\n\nquick connect toolbar shows when connection is already active but doesn't bring it to front when clicked\n\nCould you clarify? I'm not aware of quick connect keeping connection states. Does this work differently in 1.76.12 or the develop branch?\n\njumping to messages/connection pane from view menu does not show the panes when dockstate is set to autohide\n\nDoes this work differently in 1.76.12 or the develop branch? I have a feeling that this is working the same way in those builds/branches. The notification panel was already using DPS (for quite some time) and this code wasn't modified off the top of my head...\n\nquick connect toolbar initiates connection as soon as the protocol is changed. (throws message wenn hostname is empty and does not allow to change protocol beforehand)\n\nThis is working as designed and has been this way for some time. In older builds, you would be prompted for the connection type. Reference #197 . > The components page is loaded and docked into DPS, but no tab for it is visible.\nThis is the default behavior, is working as designed and is the same as devlop/1.76.* \nIf you were to open a different panel (Help -> About) or a connection, you would see the panel tab.\nTo change this, Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Check \"Always Show panel tabs\"\n\n\nquick connect toolbar shows when connection is already active but doesn't bring it to front when clicked\n\nThanks for the clarification. I was thinking the quick connect text box not the connections drop down...\nThis was also fixed with commit 2f0550de8ea715267dab7ad886d251485012357d\n\njumping to messages/connection pane from view menu does not show the panes when dockstate is set to autohide\n\nSince it's the same in develop (and I have a feeling it's been this way forever), feel free to open a new issue as an enhancement with details on how you would like this to function and we can review accordingly.\n\nquick connect toolbar initiates connection as soon as the protocol is changed. (throws message wenn hostname is empty and does not allow to change protocol beforehand)\n\nYes, working as designed. The theory here is to allow for easy keyboard navigation since users likely just typed in a hostname... When typing is complete, tab to the protocol button -> arrow down to the desired protocol -> Enter to connect\nFeel free to open a new issue on this one as well if you'd like to see different functionality. We can review this as well.. Opened #1264 for the overlay icon problem. Opened #1265 for the putty problem. Opened #1266 for the connection tree move problem.. closing this issue as all items were addressed (fixed, working as designed or new issues opened for specific items).. Maybe we should wait until 1.77 when magic lib is removed and the cred manager is in there... With just DPS and the new themes, it does look a bit nicer... Cred manager would be good to show off also.... @farosch Were you going to look into this one (per the gitter chat)?\nThanks.. Looks like HandleEvent_ModelCanDrop is always getting \"Item\" as e.DropTargetLocation.. ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler.cs hasn't been modified since 11/2017...\nConnectionTree.cs was modified for the Segoe UI font with some other refactoring, I reverted that change and still had the problem. Reference commit: d87283b7d7686b9d6927e29ea3a60fa5fe7431b8\nSome thoughts:\npull the source for ObjectListView and build the latest to see how that goes. There a a few fixes, but none related to this problem.\nDPI related fixes might be having a negative impact on this?. Confirmed fix. Closing.. Assigned to @farosch - would love a PR for this. Thanks!!. Assigned to @farosch - Thanks for the assistance!\n@sparerd What are your thoughts on this:\n\nWhen not docked yet, dock and expand/show/focus\n\nShould it be docked/expand/show/focus or just expand/show/focus. Since docking would potentially save the users layout which may be undesired.. #1275 has been merged. Closing.. See if you still get the prompt after restarting and changing other unrelated options again. The latest changed made a few changed and it might prompt you once/the first time options are modified since some theme names changed. . duplicate of #1172\nI believe this this may have been fixed with #1265 when PuTTYNG only (other putty builds are not expected to integrate as cleanly).\nFeel free to test/validate with the build from appveyor (note that these builds are currently UNSIGNED binaries) - I would recommend testing the portable release unzipped into a different folder as to not impact your main installation or standard portable location:\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/nhd146cxy44y2x5x/artifacts/Release%2FmRemoteNG-Portable-1.77.0.3887.zip\n. Unable to reproduce in magiclibbrach with #1265 (latest changed that touch some PuTTYNG and display items). \nMy putty sessions send to a large area of the window, so I had a lot of space available in comparison to your screen shots. I then shrunk the sessions down quite small by resizing the mRemoteNG window and everything still looked good.\nWill keep an eye on this going forward... \n. Scaling fixes are included included in the devlop branch and scheduled for 1.77 - WPF would be a re-write of all of our UIs and it not planned at the moment.\nclosing as duplicate of #321. @sparerd  - I haven't looked at the cred repo stuff since before it was initially pulled out, so I don't recall... But does it store all credential records individually or can you have user/password pairs that are selectable?\nFor example, if I use the super secure combination of \"user\" and \"password\" across 5 hosts, would I have 5 separate records tied to each of the 5 hosts, or 1 credential record that is used by all 5 hosts?\nIf it's the later, then there would need to be some adjustments to the described design to select a credential record or create a new one if necessary. The credential record selection would replace the user/password fields.. @kajkocar the mono_support branch is stale (way out of date) and is not ready to be merged. We don't have any current plans for mono support. Feel free to follow #308 as this would be updated should mono support plans change.. You need to use %!USERNAME% and %!PASSWORD% to escape special chars. See https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#shell-metacharacter-escaping. It doesn't look like there is a way within the remote desktop library to trigger a logoff directly. However, there may be some other unmanaged code that we can call: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtslogoffsession\nI found some instances of this not being a viable solution since some remote systems don't return sessions information properly. But It's work investigating.. . Closing as duplicate of #1133 - please follow that issue for further updates.. Closing as duplicate of #1094 \nThis will be included in 1.77 - see #1094 for details.. @sparerd Will this be possible with the cred mgr changes?. Yes, this will have a negative impact on the about page... But I wouldn't be opposed to removing the release notes from the about page and/or using something like pandoc to pretty up the release notes on the about page in an html format (or, back to plain text if necessary).\nThat would require a build time job since pandoc doesn't have a viable/current c# interface. This isn't really a big deal other than likely a minor delay in AppVeyor build times.. publish project now gets kicked off on a tag. Deployment then gets kicked off (but fails due to a 401)\nNeed to adjust the publish project build to run in a single job and deploy accordingly... Getting there.... @sparerd if I recall correctly, that's a \"PictureBox\" which gets updated to the warning icon or whatever when a message is displayed.\nThe easiest solution might be to hide that element when no notifications exist. I attempted to get that fully/properly themed, but this was the best result...\nBut that was 4-6 weeks ago, so I don't remember any further specifics without looking into the code to jog my memory.. Fixed in commit d3f3a14b1f415c5bfb4ea5a189ba33b83b645b56. @mjbnz Thanks for the PR! I did a quick once over and seems pretty good based on that. However, since it's a semi-significant feature it will require some further review/testing before merge. \nI did make some comments on some things that need to be changed - all minor.\nI saw that you are new to C#/VS - so if you are unsure about any of those let me know and I'd be more than happy to point you in the right direction, or if you're completely stuck I can push the updates into the PR.\nDid you test this against MySQL only or did you test against MariaDB as well? I haven't used either programmatically in a while (just front end access) - I don't know/recall if there will be any differences in accessing MariaDB as it's a more open fork of MySQL. Did you research/review this at all? If so, do you expect that your changes would support MariaDB as well?\nThanks again for the contribution!\n@sparerd So long as nothing major crops up during further review/testing, I'd be OK to get this into 1.77 - especially considering the perpetual experimental state of *SQL support - this wouldn't really impact that negatively. Just want to make sure that you're OK with this as well.... @sparerd This look OK to merge after a quick review.  What do you think?\nThe Jenkins failure looks like to be a Jenkins problem, so nothing concerning there.... @sparerd I'm OK with this PR for the external tool changes. I don't see any reason not to have this functionality. Thoughts? . I've also encountered this, but didn't have a chance to review it further. Only seems to have started happening semi-recently.. No option needed.. Discovered while attempting to re-test #1093. > \n\nThat's correct, but shouldn't it just work? I mean, what happens when Windows 10 1903 is released for everybody?\n\nIdeally the problem will be gone by the time the final 1903 build rolls around... Microsoft has release \"broken\" insider builds that had poor experiences with mRemoteNG in the past... Reference #337, #339, and #1058.\nWe will do due diligence on our end, but unless we find a smoking gun in our code, it's unlilkey that we'll be able to confirm and fix anything until after the final 1903 is released should the problem still occur.\nAnd it's not like MS only releases broken insider builds these days... Not that I had any problems with 1809 (and still don't) but that was a debacle and a half from the tech media coverage of it... :wink:. This will be resolved when #690 is implemented. Scheduled for 1.77\nThis impact all user settings, not just themes.. There were a lot of theming fixes/changes in the dev branch - this should be resolved in 1.77 - an alpha build should be available in the near future.... Work has already been completed to merge 0.71 into puttyng. Testing has not yet been completed.\nBuild is available here if you want to test:\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/mremoteng/puttyng-77pmq/builds/23130281/artifacts\nThis will be included in 1.77 and we will discuss another 1.76 release.. @sparerd - the entire app is less than 90 megs installed. If our target audience doesn't have that free, they have bigger problems. I say we just remove that dialog and simplify the installer.... _rdpClient.AdvancedSettings8.AudioCaptureRedirectionMode = Convert.ToBoolean(_connectionInfo.RedirectMicrophones);\nLooks a little cleaner... But at a minimum you don't need the cast or parenthesis. . @sparerd I could likely put a user prompt here if you feel it's absolutely necessary.. This check might be unnecessary since we're doing it later... But I suppose there is no need for the event handler if we know we're not going to do anything with it.. \"this\" qualifier is not needed.. I agree. That return should be removed. \nFix that and I'll accept the PR.\nThanks!. This translation seems to have been removed?. missing characters. missing characters. missing characters. We'll  have to rename at least the 3 vs*.theme files in https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/tree/35fada7fcd535777899cd00d99763766ecafd717/mRemoteV1/Resources/Themes then....\nThose 3 theme names will conflict with the DPS out of the box themes.\nMoving/renaming the 3 files will likely cause less problems, but can't really redirect since they share the same name... Not sure which ones are in use by more users though... \nLet me know what you think - I'm fine either way, they are simple changes.... @sparerd - test it like this (to see if you have the same problems). I ran the debug portable build outside of VS. Also inside VS without any breakpoints.\nRe-enable the dispose call.\nOpen PuTTY Session\nType exit (within the putty session) to allow putty to close it's own process\nHang.\nClosing the tab with the X closes just fine.. Might have to go with the direct createprocess route... I'll look into that further. OK... I think I've got this taken care of in 6156ce48acc1000bc10b783ae04c673f8990d358\nI feel this is the best solution and should go largely unnoticed by our users... . a few more changes related to themes after feedback from @jcefoli on gitter. I think this is very solid not. Marking this one as resolved.. I suggest focusing the text box only if it's not filled out:\nstring.IsNullOrEmpty(e.ClickedItem.Text) ? _cmbQuickConnect.Focus() : btnQuickConnect_ButtonClick(this, e);\nThis would allow the proper workflow in either scenario.... Fixed in commit b0bf31b29c078425f526c2e90feb1ac58da2cc5f. MagicLibrary has been removed from mRemoteNG - this was just done recently: see commit 8281f488f3c32e84d10d9567c90620388d43007b\nSo the MagicLibrary reference needs to be removed. Looks like there were very minimal UI changes (just in the settings) and I don't believe that area used MagicLib at all - so this should be a quick removal with no real ramifications in theory. . Just eyeballing the diff on GitHub (I didn't do an in depth review, so I apologize if I've missed something) - I don't see any use of this reference. If it's not in use, please remove the reference and the nuget.. If the lib is not in use, remove the nuget as well per my previous comment.. Since the class was renamed, the file should be renamed as well.\nThis is best done via the git command line - in order to keep all history:\ngit mv SqlDatabaseConnectionTester.cs DatabaseConnectionTester.cs\nIf you're not familiar or comfortable with the git command line, let me know and I should be able to push the necessary change directly into this PR..

Interestingly, the Xml objects seem to only be left over from initial program load.

Starting the app with a small cons file then opening a very large cons file makes memory spike up, as is expected. However, reloading the smaller cons file leaves memory at the same level as when the large file was loaded.\n. This may be due to event handlers not being unregistered when the ConnectionTreeModel changes.\n. More research shows that the event handlers are not likely to be the cause.\n. It looks like the TreeListView is retaining a reference to the ConnectionInfos that should be disposed.\nIn a test going from large file loaded to small file loaded, the dominator of ConnectionInfo objects that survived GC is TreeListView (exclusively).

The use case for producing the leak is pretty uncommon. Downgrading this issue and putting it back into the backlog for later investigation.\n. I'll take another look at it, though my guess is it isn't an issue anymore. The credential management branch is changing the lifetime of the ConnectionTreeModel to make it approximate a singleton style.. It may take a significant amount of time to track down and resolve the main leak. The good news is that the use case for producing the leak is somewhat uncommon and it only lasts for the lifetime of the application (managed heap leak).

This is related to the following old Jira tickets:\n- https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-917\n- https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-739\n- https://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-928\n. Phase 1 complete. Security page created. We can now manipulate the encryption settings.\nNow, we must make the de/serializers respect those settings.\n- Serializers will respect the user settings, taken from the security options page.\n- Deserializers will look for a particular attribute embedded within the serialized connections data. In the case of Xml, this will be a parent element that will not be encrypted.\n. Note: We will still need to support deserializing the legacy encryption type.\n. There are some issues with how I wanted to implement the confCons schema changes. Making the Connections node a child of the new EncryptionInfo node causes some rather uncomfortable issues. The best way to get around those issues is to move the attributes that were in EncryptionInfo into the Connections element. This requires the least amount of change... though admittedly it will require some rollbacks on the branch.\n. Encryption/decryption with the new system is working well. Resolved all the bugs that I could find.\n. closes #157 \n. Password protection is a current feature of mRemoteNG, though it is hidden in an odd location.\nThe feature can be turned on by going to the root \"Connections\" node in the connection tree and turning \"Password protect\" to Yes. The program will require that password to decrypt the file. To change the password, you must deactivate then reactivate this feature.\n\nDoes this adequately address your issue?\n. When we implement this, we should support handling the following URI schemes as defined by IANA (https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml):\n- http\n- https\n- ssh\n- vnc\nThe following unregistered URI schemes should also be strongly considered, with respect to RFC7595:\n- rdp\n- ica\n- tel (for telnet)\n- raw\n- rlog (for RLogin). dotTrace profile snapshot of mRemoteNG starting up. Connections file loaded in a normal amount of time. No appreciable lag.\nmRemoteNG_startup_snapshot.zip\n. dotTrace profile snapshot of saving a large connections file using AES/GCM (no full file encryption). this took a significant amount of time (4 min). App was unresponsive the whole time.\nmRemoteNG_saving_large_file.zip\n. The serialization lag seems to be occurring due to Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Generators.Pkcs5S2ParametersGenerator.GenerateDerivedMacParameters(Int32)\nin mRemoteNG.Security.SymmetricEncryption.AeadCryptographyProvider.SimpleEncryptWithPassword(Byte[], String, Byte[]) (line 115)\n. This may be due to the number of iterations in our key derivation function (10000).\n. This is indeed due to the PBKDF2 interation count.\nGiven: a small-ish confCons file saved in 3 different versions\n- v2.5\n- v2.6 w/10k iterations, AES/GCM\n- v2.6 w/1k iterations), AES/GCM\nTests: utilized unit test \"Folder211HasOneConnection\"\n- v2.5: ~450 ms\n- v2.6 w/10k:  ~1200 ms\n- v2.6 w/1k: ~550 ms\nThe PBKDF2 specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898#section-4.2) indicates that the iteration count must be at least 1000. We could hard code this value, or build it into the Xml schema to allow for user preference (with a coded minimum of 1k).\n. KdfIterations attribute now written into the xml schema. Users can change this value on the Security options page\n. With Aes/GCM and 1k kdfi, the save/load of the massive file goes from ~4min to ~20sec. Better, but not great.\nIt seems that passwords are re-saved in children that inherit the password from their parent. We can potentially save quite a bit of processing power by only saving the password at the root of an inheritance chain.\n. With password inheritance de-duping, save/load time for the large file goes from ~20sec to ~5sec\n. The primary issue of saving/loading taking forever is mostly resolved. However, it would still be good to keep the save/load from tying up the UI thread.\n. I'm replicating as well. Taking a look. May be connected to #166\n. Was an issue with how the encryption key was being saved within the application session. resolved now, though more cleanup needs to be done.\n. Thanks for submitting this PR!\nWould you consider splitting this into multiple smaller PRs? Going through all +7k lines will take us a very long time. At the very least, the fix to #168 must be a separate PR to make it easier to evaluate.\n(Don't worry about the Jenkins build failure. Our pipeline is having issues checking out PRs at the moment.)\n. Thanks for the suggestion, we will look into it. Looks like this feature was introduced in RDP8, so it is indeed available to us.\n. You must be using version 1.75 Beta 1 (or higher, though that is the current highest version). The RDP connection record must be configured where Sounds = Bring to this computer. Then the Sound Quality option will be available.\n. Taking a look at the ListView class, it doesn't look like it's in use anywhere. We can safely delete the whole class. This was probably left over from before the ObjectListView switch-over.\n. Merged fix provided by @mrwulf. This will be available in the next patch. This only affects users that have been building/using the develop branch. 1.74 has a confCons version of 2.5. Schema version was bumped to 2.6 when I implemented the EncryptionEngine and EncryptionMode attributes.\nThe initial hardcoded value for how many iterations the key derivation function should use (10,000) had a severe performance impact as the confCons file size increases. To get around the issue, I added the KdfIterations attribute to the schema. The default value for the KdfIterations is now 1,000, whereas the previous value was 10,000. When this value does not match the value used during encryption, decryption will fail and the user will be prompted with a password dialog (it assumes that the password is wrong, there's no way to know the true parameter mismatch).\nUsers that had been testing this 2.6 schema on the develop branch will need to do one of two things:\n- Add KdfIterations=\"10000\" attribute to the Connections node in the confCons file, similar to below:\nxml\n<Connections Name=\"Connections\" Export=\"False\" EncryptionEngine=\"AES\" BlockCipherMode=\"GCM\" KdfIterations=\"10000\" FullFileEncryption=\"False\" Protected=\"bigstringofstuff\" ConfVersion=\"2.6\">\n- OR, revert back to a v2.5 schema version of their confCons file\n. There are a few reasons we've been looking into replacing PuTTY as the default ssh/etc client:\n- Tighter integration. We currently spawn a new PuTTY process off of mRemoteNG. It's essentially acting like any other external program you can define, just with a little more built-in support.\n- Better security. Because PuTTY is called as an external program, we have to pass host/username/and password data to it in clear text over the command line.\n- Better customization. Since SSH.Net is a library, we can control every minute aspect of the connection that it establishes and how it is displayed to the user.\n- As @jumoog said, this also allows for better Linux support. SSH.Net is written in .Net Core which runs on Linux. Removing the PuTTY requirement is a good step toward cross platform support.\nFor those that still like PuTTY, we will be keeping it around as an option for handling ssh/telnet/RAW/etc. However, it will not be the default for new installations.\n. Yea, we could still load and use putty session info from the registry. It probably wouldnt be the primary way of saving ssh connection records though\n. This is all great feedback. We wont be replacing putty right away, there\nwill be plenty of time to make sure the native ssh client has the right\nfeatures\nOn Oct 22, 2016 2:59 AM, \"Kilian von Pflugk\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nauto-copy and the right-click paste is priceless\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/181#issuecomment-255516316,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGrNlozDoee22L_5wQpiR7C33ZYgFXDHks5q2dBWgaJpZM4Kae5c\n.\n. todo: investigate using Entity Framework to handle DB persistence\n. Thanks to @peterchenadded for providing the PR for this issue! This will be available in v1.76. Yes, we are working on a credential manager for v1.76. A preview is available already on the develop branch. Tried looking through the currently available RDP library options and couldn't find anything specific to DPI scaling. We will need to investigate further to see if anything can be done.. I think this issue will be resolved with #321 . I can confirm that it is not an issue with serialization or internal storage of the passwords in memory. My guess is the issue comes when attempting to pass the characters to PuTTY.\n\nI wonder if this only occurs when attempting to SSH, or if other protocols have issues.\n. Live test shows that RDP is also affected\n. Verified the issue is still present in the current develop branch\n. RDP is actually not affected. I was using a character that was not supported by windows auth (\u252c).\nSSH is still affected for standard international characters in the current build.\n. The cmdline args being passed to PuTTY are correct. I'm starting to think this is on PuTTY's side.\n. Based on packet captures performed during interactive login with putty v.067, I'm not confident that PuTTY is accepting the following characters:  \u00a3\u00b0\u00fa\u00e4\nWhat is interesting, is that other users are saying interactive login is working for them, even with these special characters. More research is needed.\n. Finally got the PuTTYNG project to build. Slogging through the authentication code to figure out of there's some evidence to support my theory\n. Still not sure why this happens for higher order ascii characters, though I've traced it all the way through to where PuTTY sends the auth data to the remote server. The password was never corrupted at any point along the chain of custody (entry into mRemoteNG -> passing to PuTTY via cmdline -> PuTTY parsing it to send to server).\nWhen capturing packets during session initiation, the following interesting thing happened:\nThe first authentication attempt using the -pw switch with PuTTY failed, though the data packet appears to have the correct ascii code (0xFA) for the higher order character i was testing (\u00fa).\nThe second auth attempt (made with interactive keyboard) succeeded. However, this packet did not seem to send the expected ascii code for \u00fa. It sent 0xC3 (\u00c3). Wat.\nAttempting to substitute 0xFA with 0xC3 during -pw authentication also did not work. This was somewhat expected, but still very Wat.\n. The only difference I can find between the two situations (parameterized vs. interactive) is this:\nInteractive\n- password is prefixed with padding data value 0x10 (Data Line Escape)\n- password is suffixed with padding value 0xba (\u00ba)\nParameterized\n- password is prefixed with data value 0x0f (Shift In / X-Off)\n- password has no suffix value\n. As much as I'd like to figure this out, it seems to be out of scope for mRemoteNG itself. There is no indication that mRemoteNG is doing anything to prevent proper handling of the password by PuTTY. In fact, this is looking like a bug in PuTTY itself (or maybe a character encoding issue between cmd.exe and PuTTY).\nThe best thing we can do to attempt to alleviate this issue is to provide a PuTTY replacement (such as SSH.NET, which is a planned feature).\nI want to do a bit more research into this as a PuTTY bug and add a corresponding known-issue page on our Wiki so we don't have to re-explain the problem.\n. @koumdros Would you be willing to provide the string of args you are passing to WinSCP? It may be related, or at least worth looking into.\n. Closing this issue as we will likely not be able to resolve the character encoding (besides providing a putty replacement). If more information is uncovered, we can reopen this ticket.\nI've created a known-error record to document that this is a known issue. https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#ssh-login-fails-when-password-contains-extended-ascii-characters\n. @franzbar if you are viewing the password with an external tool (such as %COMSPEC% /k %PASSWORD%) then cmdline metacharacters such as ! are escaped with ^. To not perform any escaping, use %!PASSWORD% as mentioned in https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External%20Tools\n.

It appears a workaround was available. Closing this ticket. We will need to investigate whether this is an issue with our implementation or something in the version of the RDP library we are using.. @benwa Could you take a look at this PR when you have time?\n. Hey @Kvarkas and @benwa \nWhat's the status of this PR? Is it something that will be picked up again or is it dead?. @Kvarkas @benwa I'm going to close this PR since there hasn't been any movement on it. Feel free to reopen if that changes. Tested exporting a folder (and its contents) in v1.75 beta1 and it's working as expected. I think we will be releasing 1.75 beta 2 soon - once that is out I'd recommend testing with that version. (However, 1.75 introduced some new configuration file properties. These are not backward compatible with previous versions.). Need to handle the NSSError event thrown by the Gecko browser. Default should be to prompt the user whether they would like to continue.\nNot entirely sure how to get the IE browser working yet.\n. The IE browsers inability to prompt to continue was introduced in commit a1beff7 that was meant to fix another bug. Trying to find that ticket..\n. Here is the related bug report for commit a1beff7: MR-706\nThis may require us to add a connection-specific option for toggling error suppression.\n. The geckofx documentation isn't that great. Going to need to play around with this for awhile. No guarantees this will make it into 1.75\n. Yes, this was proven to cause bugs when focus changed between certain connection types. It was removed until we could reimplement it correctly. However, we haven't had the time to re-add it since then. I can't completely commit to having this in the next version, but it's in the front of my mind along with HiDPI support and the credential manager. \nIt may also be valuable (but not mandatory) to do #155 first.. I think this one was removed in v1.73 (unreleased) which then got rolled into the v1.74 release when we took over the code base from the previous maintainer. I know a few folks have asked about it.\nI have no issue with bringing it back, though I would like to give users the option between the pop-up and drop-down selection styles. Something in the options pages to control it maybe?\n. Thanks for the report. Does this happen even when small amounts of text are copied? A few characters/words?\nI think that rdpclip.exe usually handles clipboard transfer between localhost and remotes, though I'm not sure if the library we use also uses that exe. Generally, restarting rdpclip.exe resolves things. If our library has a built in way to handle the shared clipboard, then restarting rdpclip just won't do anything.\nThere are some lines of code that hook into the system clipboard. We would have to dig a bit, but it would be worth checking out.. This will be available in v1.76. Adding to this, a true credential manager feature is in the works for v1.76 (the release after next).\n. This feature is mostly complete and will be included in the v1.76 alpha (whenever that happens). There are some pretty important features that still need to be included before it can be used for production sysadmin work.. I'm going to try to break apart the final implementation details of the credential manager to smaller pieces that need to be completed for this feature to be rolled out to the public. If anyone would like to help out with the implementation, I highly encourage it. Pull requests are awesome! Just give me a heads up so I don't duplicate your work.\nWork that needs to be done\n- [x] #659 \n- [ ] #660\n- [ ] #667 \n- [ ] #672 \n- [x] #673\n- [x] #680\n- [ ] #1289\n- [ ] #1364\nWe will also need general testing done after these known-bugs are worked out.. Pushing this back to v1.77. The feature is not ready for production use and we have other features and fixes that need to be released sooner. I'm starting the work of reapplying the credential manager feature to the develop branch. It was reverted for the v1.76 release because it was not ready for production.. No \"fix\" was really implemented as I could not find an issue with mRemoteNG. Created a test to ensure higher order ascii characters are saved correctly\n. What sorts of things stop working when this occurs? Some areas of the\nscreen becoming un-clickable? Some key strokes not being transferred?\n- David Sparer\nOn Fri, Oct 28, 2016 at 9:56 AM, sutty550e notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI should also say, if I make an RDP connection outside of mRemoteNG, using\njust RDP, the version I had to upgrade to in order to make use of the\nlatest version of mRemoteNG, I have no such issue.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/210#issuecomment-256958554,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGrNliTWIS9bw0OE-SrA2qT1_bXVkv4Tks5q4htIgaJpZM4KjlJB\n.\n.

The wiki is not open for edits. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a good secure way to do so.\nThe wiki is just another git repo, luckily, so you can clone it like anything else. To clone our wiki, you can do something like:\nVia Https\ngit clone https://github.com/mremoteng/mremoteng.wiki.git\nVia SSH\ngit clone git@github.com:mremoteng/mremoteng.wiki.git\nThere is an article showing the process here: https://gist.github.com/larrybotha/10650410\nAdmittedly, this is not an ideal way to deal with updates. But I'm also worried about just opening up the wiki for edits.. Either way is good with me. Thanks for your contribution, this is great!. Sorry for the delay - page is now posted (with credits in the gitlog). Thanks for writing this up!\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/SSH-File-Transfer. May be an issue with the RDP library we use. We will need to investigate. Yea, sounds good to me. As long as we get a PR soonish we should be able to include it.. It looks like the library that we have used for crypto (BouncyCastle) has now gone through the compliance screening for FIPS. It looks like the encryption algorithms and modes that we are using are all valid when running in FIPS compliance mode, so we may be able to support FIPS with a bit of work.\nThere is an important distinction here, though. This change would mean mRemoteNG is using a crypto library which has been validated as FIPS compliant. However, mRemoteNG itself will not be FIPS certified. Using the crypto library in FIPS compliant mode might be enough to use mRemoteNG on systems with FIPS enforcement enabled but I'm not certain about that.. BouncyCastle user guide for the FIPS compliant module:\nhttps://downloads.bouncycastle.org/fips-csharp/BC-FNA-UserGuide-1.0.1.pdf. @kmscode Yea, let's proceed with your plan. mRemoteNG only ever had support for importing RDCMan v2.2 files. Supporting v2.7 imports would be a new feature.. This will be included in the next major release, v1.76. Thanks for the report. We will need to see if this is a bug on the mRemoteNG side or the VncSharp side.. This is already present.\nIt can be turned on by going to Tools -> Options -> Appearance tab -> check 'Minimize to notification area'\n. Can you please provide step by step instructions on how we can reproduce this?\n. This feature already exists.\nCustom encryption password can be set by clicking the root \"Connections\" node in the tree view and setting Password protect to Yes\nYou can turn on full file encryption (rather than just encrypting passwords) by going to Tools -> Options -> Advanced tab -> and check Completely encrypt connection file\n. We are completely redoing the credential saving in the next next version (v1.76) which will fix this somewhat. Though I do agree with you that the UI/UX is pretty poor for some features (such as setting a custom encryption password). We have an outside group that may be taking a look at some of these UI blackholes in the future.\n. Created #237 to look into improving the discover-ability of this feature\n. Somewhat related to #239 \n. Somewhat related to #238 \n. In addition, there have been several situations where having default connection values for each protocol type would be useful. One implementation option that came up in discussion of another issue (#1060).\nUser request:\n\nAny chance we could also get this to have default inheritance parameters set per-folder? So that way it's not just forced from root onto all?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot sure about setting it on a per-folder basis. While it would be possible, we would need to be careful about how it was implemented.\nIt might be possible to make it an assignment-based property, similar to how the new credential management feature is going to work. You could manage a list of 'Defaults' that would represents named default connection/inheritance objects. Then assign these defaults to folders. New connections & folders would take defaults from their parent folder. Folders could also be set to inherit the default values from their parents.. Current object diagram (UML):\n\n\n. Proposed object diagram (UML):\n\nLegend:\n- Light red = new interface/class\n- Orange = class requires explicit changes\n- Purple = there will be implicit changes due to inheritance, though no explicit changes required\n- Blue = no implicit or explicit changes\n. Purpose of proposed changes:\nRemove RootNodeInfo from the ConnectionInfo object graph.\nConsiderations:\n- We do not want to re-implement the ContainerInfo code, so we want to have a base implementation that both ContainerInfo and RootNodeInfo can use. Thus, ContainerInfo should implement ITreeNodeContainer and delegate its implementation to a TreeNodeContainerBase through composition.\n- We will want a type to encapsulate the ConnectionInfo, ContainerInfo, and RootNodeInfo types for ease of use with the connection tree. Thus, all have been made to implement ITreeNode.\n- I forgot to include the PuttySessionInfo type, which inherits from ConnectionInfo. This class will not need to be changed explicitly, but will receive implicit modification through inheritance (would be colored purple on the graph.)\n- By performing the proposed changes, some other code will need to be refactored to work correctly. Namely, anything referencing the AbstractConnectionInfoData class that should also accept a RootNodeInfo or RootPuttySessionsNodeInfo class will need to be changed to use ITreeNode. Further, all references to ContainerInfo should instead reference ITreeNodeContainer.\n- Class names may need to be changed to make sense, given the new model. Specifically, I don't like having \"Tree\" in ITreeNode and ITreeNodeContainer since they don't necessarily have to be used in a tree data structure. Suggestions very much welcome.\nRisk:\n- Due to the considerations above, this change has a moderate amount of risk to introduce subtle bugs.\n- The most likely components at risk are:\n  - the connection tree\n  - the config window\n. @kmscode I know I'm throwing a bunch of stuff at you, but could you provide your feedback on this proposal when you have time?\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. The following article will help you resolve this issue:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#mremoteng-crashes-with-the-error-class-not-registered-when-trying-to-connect-using-rdp\n. We will keep this ticket open as an acceptance-criteria for future ssh solutions. For now, I'm tagging this as a bug. The issue came when copying inheritance from a deserialized ConnectionInfo object to a ContainerInfo object. The Inheritance object was not cloned and copied as required.\nThis bug only affected folder inheritance. This would have only been noticed by users building directly from the develop branch on post-v1.75alpha3 builds.\n. I would like to have default connection options for every supported protocol, which would fit your needs (if i'm understanding you correctly).\nCurrently, we can only set protocol options for the default protocol.. Glad to hear you found a way to make it work! Closing the issue. Thanks for the report - this is an odd one.\nCould you provide the mRemoteng.log file as mentioned in https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\n. That is a very odd bug.\nThe last exception screenie you posted is something we usually see when there are missing RDP KBs. Can you confirm if you are able to connect via RDP successfully? Relevant article: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#mremoteng-crashes-with-the-error-class-not-registered-when-trying-to-connect-using-rdp\nIf it's not RDP causing it, then I think we are discovering a new prereq we may need to package with the installer.\n. Yea, log files would be great.\nHere's an article on how to collect them: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\n. Someone else in my office was able to replicate the CLASSNOTREG exception when trying to close the components window.\n. I haven't been able to reproduce on my machine either. I'm guessing there's something about our dev environment that is not being distributed with the binaries as required. Might even been an installer bug, tbh\n. This seems to be happening due to the client not having Citrix Receiver installed. This is not a mandatory prerequisite to have installed. It seems that the component check window is not handling the errors as gracefully as it should be.\nInvestigating possible fixes now.\n. We could add that in i suppose, but it's mostly just there to tell you if optional components are installed or not. The Citrix Receiver component is only needed if you want to use ICA connection types - the rest of the app should work just fine even if that component isn't installed.\nIt's odd that the app is having troubles with this now. I didn't think we made any changes to this part of the codebase.\n. wafflebot autoclosed the issue... didn't want that quite yet\n. The resolution was to move the using directive which instantiates the AxIca control into the try block.\n. @jumoog unfortunately not - it's all done through COM classes, so we only have interop DLLs for ICA.\n. @theWoodman Here is an updated mRemoteNG.exe (portable edition). Just overwrite the current .exe in your mRemoteNG folder. If you are using the installed version, let me know and I can compile that one instead. If this fixes it, we'll do an official beta2 release.\nmRemoteNG exe _ #254 fix 1.zip\n. You can choose to have panels always display their tabs by going to Tools -> Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Always display tabs\nOk, ill have to check it again tomorrow. Their may be more things to fix. \n. This is still an issue... I can still replicate if the test machine does not have Citrix Receiver installed. Still investigating.\n. After significant hunting, I found the commit that introduced the error: 6d1fa47\nStill need to figure out what exact change created the issue, but at least the field is narrowing.\n. The bug occurs due to the Parent property of the AxICAClient being set during object initialization using the format:\ncsharp\nvar ica = new AxICAClient {Parent = this};\nSplitting this up into 2 statements resolves the bug:\ncsharp\nvar ica = new AxICAClient();\nica.Parent = this;\n(The current production code is slightly different, but you get the idea.). Everyone that has been experiencing the issue, please test this new exe (it's portable edition). Replace the exe in your portable edition folder with the one provided below.\nmRemoteNG exe_#254 fix 2.zip\n. Thanks for confirming @nqnguyen2 \n@theWoodman let me know when you are able to test as well. Once this issue is closed we will release a beta2 version with the few bug fixes that have been completed.. Great - closing issue as resolved. Thanks everyone. Closing as duplicate of #208 \n. This seems to be resolved in v1.75 Beta 1\n. This can already be done by creating 2 panels and dragging one to split the screen. \nIt's easier to show than explain, so here's an example video\nWill close this as a duplicate of #223. We will be changing some inner workings of panels/tabs in an up coming update which should make this feature a little more intuitive.\n. Forgot to mention - you have to choose the proper panel to show the connection when the connection starts. (right click connection -> Connect (with options) -> Choose panel before connecting). Connections cant be moved between panels while active.\nDefinitely not intuitive.\n. Fix will be available in v1.75 beta2. Re-added feature, this was an oversight when rewriting the connection tree. Will be present in 1.75 beta2. Yep, can replicate as well. Might be a side effect of a small visual bug fix we tried to implement last week.. Looks like this bug has been around for a while - at least since v1.74. Since this isn't a regression bug and it seems like a pretty in depth fix will be necessary, we will likely not fix this for v1.75. Hey all, doing a bit of ticket cleanup and noticed this one is a duplicate of #176. I'm going to close this ticket, so please follow #176 for further updates.. Resolved - this will be included in the 1.75 beta 2 release. Please note that it requires registry entries to be present to work. You will not see a difference in functionality when upgrading from <= 1.75 beta 1. When upgrading from 1.75 beta 2 to newer versions, the installer will remember the previous install path.. I'm doubting that we would do this. It would likely be more work than simply adding the desired parameter to the program. Since we use the library version of RDP, it has no concept of how to load its parameters from an RDP config file (or any file really).\n(Not sure if you were just using the CredSSP param as an example, but that option can already be set by enabling Use CredSSP on the connection record.). Thanks for the report, we will need to dig into this. I think we have this solved on the most recent build of vncsharp (which mRemoteNG uses). I am going to schedule this for the next release (v1.77) for testing.. Great stuff! Thanks for writing this up. Accepting this PR. Connected to #217 . Another oversight when we rebuilt the connection tree. I'll re-add that hotkey. Hmm odd - yes please the logs may help.. Not able to replicate the issue and the log file didn't help much. Are you able to consistently replicate, or was it just that one time?. I think there is something to your original report that we should investigate. Connections loading is not acting as expected when you cancel the password prompt box and then restart the program.\nReplication steps:\n1. Set a custom password on a connections file, save it.\n1. Close and reopen mRemoteNG\n1. Hit Cancel on the password prompt\n1. Close and reopen mRemoteNG\n1. You will not be prompted for a password (as expected). The root connection tree node will be erroneously named \"PuTTY Saved Sessions\".\nOriginal bug report:\n\nI have used a password protected file that i created fresh with Beta 1. Today i clicked cancel when loading Mremote cause i didnt mean to load it. I than closed mremote. When i went to use it later on in the day it didnt open the password protected file. I tried to load all backup files and none are current. I looked everywhere and cannot find a recent file that i have protected.\nI tried to load the .xml files in notepad and all of the backup ones are viewable. The current one is not. It seems like its encrypted. So im not sure what happened but it seems its messed up.. Looks like the issue occurs if you have the save-on-close setting enabled. The saving mechanism has no concept of safety and will overwrite the valid-but-still-encrypted connections file with whatever is in the tree (which is nothing).\n\nThis seems like a somewhat serious bug, in that it can wipe out connections files under certain situations.. Correct, though there is some complexity here around that. There are a few use cases:\nAfter cancelling the password prompt, you could:\n1. Exit mRemoteNG\n1. Try to save the current (empty) connections tree.\n1. File -> Open and try to load the file again\nCase 1: we should NOT save anything (even if the save-on-close option is set) and try to load the same file on next start up.\nCase 2: force all normal \"save\" actions to be \"save-as\" actions instead to prevent accidental overwrites.\nCase 3: nothing special here, just try to reload the file.\nCase 1 is very serious and should be fixed immediately, case 2 is somewhat important and would be a good safety measure, and I think case 3 is already working as expected.. Resolved case 1 with a minor change. There are still some improvements I'd like to make, though the worst part of the issue is resolved.. Just as a side note, there is a common-exttool entry for this. It's pretty much just what you wrote up in your initial post.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Common-External-Tool-Configurations#powershell-enter-pssession\nI agree, native PS support would be a nice feature to add.. Yea, we can edit them to be https. Though we have https rewrites turned on for (nearly) all subdomains anyways.\nThe forum has been a bit of a thorn and will take a bit more work to update. We need to migrate it to a new hosting service first.. ack - will do. Resolved the repo description links. Closing issue as resolved, with the caveat that we will be working on the forum via #288 . Looks like a decent initiative. We'll start going through it. Looks like we already qualify in most categories. Just need a few tweaks.. Added cii progress badge to README.md. We need to get the forum onto a different hosting solution. It is (i think) the last thing being hosted on rmcardle's account. Would be good to get that moved somewhere else by end of 2016.\nNeed to:\n1. Set up a phpBB app\n2. Transfer DB (mysql) from old instance to the new one\n3. Verify (=hope) everything worked. prophpbb looks good. We'll just have to ensure we can upload our current DB. I worry a little bit about losing obscure info that has built up on the forums over time. (It's been a prominent hit on Google search for some errors.) Though on the other hand, if the info is important enough to keep it should be documented on the wiki rather than buried in the forums.. I'm a bit torn over this. But if we give the community-at-large enough forewarning, I'd be ok with it. Would definitely be nice to have one less thing to secure.. I'm good with that. Timeline for shutdown is up for debate. I may have to talk with Riley about forum pricing. We might be able to work it out with him to sublease the current forum hosting and re-imburse him from the org funds. That would at least get us out of migrating the forum.. I think 1 month would be sufficient (a week or two might even be plenty). I just don't want people to be blindsided by it.. @Benchwork thanks for the offer! We could probably start that now. Just skim through the support sub-forum and look for common/recurring questions or anything that seems useful. Compile a document and we can figure out which sections of the wiki to add it to. Some might be more Q&A/known issues, some might be worth putting in the user manual (we do need help updating and filling out the user manual!). Proposed timeline (comments requested):\n- Post a community notice of our intention with a timeline of events. Deadline: today\n- Get the reddit community up and running. We already have the name saved. Just need to make it public and set owners/mods/sidebar info. Deadline: end of the weekend (Dec. 4)\n- Update website with links to Reddit community.\n- Turn on read-only mode for the phpBB forum sometime next week (Dec 9th?).\n- Turn off the forum and redirect DNS entries to reddit community. Deadline: Dec. 31st\nI will take a backup of the DB before deleting things, just in case we need it again.. I've created #293 for compiling useful info from the wiki. Any help with it is much appreciated!. Notice of intention posted to the forums.. Forum is now read-only. It will remain operational for a little while. We need to put a link to the reddit community on the website.. Forum is still online but all activity is now on Reddit. I've created #606 to track final decomm tasks. Closing this issue. I'm not able to replicate the issue. Is this the portable or installed version?. Thanks for the PR!\nI just have 1 thing for you to fix, then we can accept it:\n- Currently, the new screenshots are not tracked by mRemoteV1.csproj. Make sure that the Screenshots/QuickConnect/*.png files are being tracked as content items and that they are set to copy to the output directory (copy if newer). (This last part is key, otherwise the screenshots won't exist when we build the program.)\nI can help out if needed - just let me know.. Good deal - we have dev environment requirements posted up on the wiki if needed.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Development-Environment. Looks good - accepting this PR. Anyone willing to help us out with this?. Resolved. I think i've found the issue. Working on building a test for this now. built out some tests and resolved the underlying issue in commit 6019515. I want to make sure I followed your replication instructions correctly:\n1. create connection 1 (RDP) and set its panel=test\n1. create connection 2 (SSH) and set its panel=General\n1. Open connection 1\n1. Open connection 2\n1. We expect that connection 1 will be disconnected immediately when connection 2 connects\n^^^ Following the above steps, I was not able to replicate the issue.. Still not able to replicate. Would you be able to create a video of you replicating the issue? If you do, be sure to hide all sensitive information (host names/user names/etc). If necessary, I can provide a more secure method of sharing the information if you don't want to post it here.. Ahhh, I see. This is due to the RDP session changing its draw area. When the client-side draw area changes, it informs the remote server what the new draw area is. Since this can only be set at connect-time, this triggers a reconnection.\nI'm still not able to replicate, but @kmscode might have some more insight on what combo of settings may be causing this.. Yep, several things are going on here. The setting for always showing panel tabs is not enabled, so when there is only 1 panel open, it will not show a tab. When this happens, you go from having 2 rows of tabs (panel tabs and connection tabs) to only having 1 row (connect tabs). This then causes the client area to get a bit bigger, triggering the RDP redraw and reconnection.\nA way to test if this is the issue is to enable the following setting:\nTools -> Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Always show panel tabs. ;). I think we found a sort-of-fix for this relating to PuTTY settings. I'll try to dig up that conversation.... Haven't seen this sort of error before. Does this happen every time you attempt to start the app?. Might be worth trying to uninstall/reinstall the app, if you haven't already.. Could you provide the mRemoteNG log? Details here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\nYou can also try deleting the user.config file (also mentioned in that article.). Can you attached the entire mremoteng.log file?. Based on that log, it looks like the app was crashing sometime between setting the system culture and trying to import putty entries.. Looks like there are some oddities that slipped by our testing. I'll take this as a task to create more tests around the connection tree. Working on this now. Resolved deletion issue in commit 1e213df\nThere are a few other small bugs that are related to this one that I would like to fix under this ticket. Keep this open for now.. Resolved a few other small bugs related to this and move a lot of code out to their own classes to make testing easier.. This fix will be available in the next pre-release.. This is an unavoidable side effect of using PuTTY for ssh connection and one of the main reasons we want to move away from it. Related to #181 . Obscuring the password is certainly better than nothing, though it would not deter a persistent attacker.\n@jumoog  Feel free to give it a shot if you'd like. We would likely use an enhancement like that (for the reasons @kmscode mentioned).. Also, it would be beneficial to use something stronger than a XOR cipher if possible. I'm not sure what symmetric crypto ciphers are already available in the putty package.\nUse well-tested and heavily scrutinized implementations of crypto functions. Ideally, this will come from a well-known library.. For lack of a better label, I'm going to tag this as a \"feature request\" since nothing is technically broken. This would be great. One of the greatest weaknesses of the project is that\nit is Windows only.\nOn Dec 9, 2016 2:42 PM, \"Ken Lewis\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWith the decision to use C# and to decouple the code base, it would be\nawesome to use Xamarin to make the renewed interest in mRemoteNG available\nto Mac OS and Mobile app platforms.\nI have been looking into using Xamarin for some upcoming cross platform\nprojects but have no personal experience actually using it.

On the UI side, we are going to be making some design changes over the next few versions to separate the UI code from the core app logic. This will take care of one of the big hurdles we have for including a Linux build. We'll probably end up going with 2 UI projects, but we haven't really discussed things that far yet.\n\nGood discussion points, everyone.. I would love to have this, but it is unfortunately still a long ways off. Here is the high level overview of what needs to happen:\n\nUI and core business logic must be split into separate assemblies. This is something I was planning on starting in the next major release (1.77). This will be a long process. I have been doing some work to remove static methods and classes as much as possible and this has uncovered a few very hairy circular dependencies that involve UI classes.\nThe library assembly must be converted to .Net Core to ensure it runs on Linux. Hopefully this will come for (mostly) free when splitting the UI and business logic.\nBetter support for pluggable protocol providers. Implementations will be different between Windows and Linux for some providers:\nRDP. Would need to integrate FreeRDP or some other open source implementation\nCitrix ICA. They offer Linux versions of the Citrix Receiver, so we might be ok here. Would still need to test.\nSSH. We would need to integrate with native Linux terminal.\n\n\nThen we can start building a *Nix compatible UI.. This cross platform open source ui project might be an interesting option:\n\nhttp://avaloniaui.net\n\nWin/nix/ios/android\nXaml based with some css like qualities\nopen source\nstill in beta, but seems to be actively developed. Another option that might be less work to implement than Avalonia: https://github.com/picoe/Eto. When I try to use autotype into an RDP session, KeePass appears to be trying to make a ui element with the text \"GlassPanelForm\" the active window and sending key strokes to that. This element appears to be part of the new ObjectListView that we now use for drawing the connection tree.\n\nI'll need to do more digging to see why this ui element is getting focus rather than the currently active connection.. For how much troubleshooting that took, the fix was comically easy.\nWe're going to release a 1.75 hotfix in a few days due to a few issues that should be fixed asap. This will be included in that release.. Closing this issue. Please feel free to reopen it if you have further questions.. We are doing some RDP enhancements in v1.77. This could probably be squeezed in at the same time.. It is very likely we will be able to include this with v1.77. We are still in the development stages for this release and don't know when this particular feature will be included. I've scheduled other RDP work for v1.77, so this would fit in nicely. Just to clarify, do you mean boot/shutdown of your local machine or mRemoteNG?. Ok, thought that was the case just wanted to be sure.

Adding for later reference:\n\nThis article was posted to our twitter account. Not sure how useful it will ultimately be, but worth having a look once implementation starts.\nhttps://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/10/24/high-dpi-scaling-improvements-for-desktop-applications-and-mixed-mode-dpi-scaling-in-the-windows-10-anniversary-update/#EgtJocMbEK8Aey6g.97. I know this is a pretty important bug/enhancement for a lot of you. I thought we would be able to get this into v1.76 but so far it has not worked out. I am going to move this issue to v1.77 so we can at least release v1.76 with what is currently available. This will be a top issue for v1.77. Yes, though I'm not able to get updates out as fast as I'd like. We actually had another alpha release last night.\nThere is a little good news for HiDPI support. I haven't had a HiDPI screen to develop with, which makes testing any sort of fix difficult. I recently ordered a new laptop and made sure to get a HiDPI screen for this issue. Beginning of next month I should be able to start on this.. I've taken a small look into the hidpi scaling issue and how we can fix it. The summary is that WinForms does not have great support for implementing scaling.\nWe will need to look at scaling issues for individual controls and fix each as they come up. Here are the main things I've found so far:\n- Every icon and image will need scaling. We might need higher resolution icons or vector graphics.\n- The quick connect and external tools toolbars have an incorrect height applied.\n- Layouts need to be redone using table layout panels in many windows (component check, external tools, ssh file transfer, port scan, some Options pages, about page, updates page, help pages, most of the dialog windows)\nSome resources I've found helpful so far:\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4075802/creating-a-dpi-aware-application\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26073635/windows-forms-dpi-scaling\n- https://www.telerik.com/blogs/winforms-scaling-at-large-dpi-settings-is-it-even-possible-\nNeed to be aware of this bug in table layout panels:\n- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3044516/nested-tablelayoutpanel-is-displayed-with-large-empty-spaces-in-a-wind. Some updates:\n- Adding <add key=\"EnableWindowsFormsHighDpiAutoResizing\" value=\"true\" /> to app.config took care of image scaling.\n- The quick connect and ext. tools toolbars had a max size of 25px set. Removing that allows them to scale appropriately.. @ravirxz It's likely to help, but not guaranteed. I'll need to test it myself to see if we need to do anything special with the RDP library to tell it when we are scaling. We should be able to fix it either way though, It's just whether it will be more work or if we will fix that issue for \"free\". (Reference #532 for mouse cursor disappearing bug). This post is also very helpful when troubleshooting: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22735174/how-to-write-winforms-code-that-auto-scales-to-system-font-and-dpi-settings#29766847. The connection tree is proving difficult to correctly scale. Images can scale correctly with some coercion, but spacing, expand buttons, and the pipe graphics connecting parents/children. It fairly minor, so I'll move on and come back to this later. Worst case we will need to completely override the rendering of the control.\n\n . I think most of the scaling issues are resolved now. There are probably some minor things that I've missed, but we can address those as they come up.. I've had issues getting RDP connections to scale properly. This thread hints at a hidden RDP property that can be set with extended properties: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/93cb63d8-b4ff-40dd-8d11-66867db6258f/rdp-activex-and-restrictedadminmode?forum=winforms. I did a bit of research on the mstscax dll today and found a property that seems promising: DesktopScaleFactor. I've been able to read the property, but any attempts to set the property so far have failed. It seems to require a ULONG value, but I can't be completely sure of that. It might also just be a pointer to a struct (which would make sense since scaling factors usually have a width & height, like SizeF).\nI've created a page to document some of what I've found in the DLL: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/MSTSCAX-Properties. Many of the settings are available in the .Net interop wrapper that we use, but some are not. I'll try to keep it updated with what I find.. Ok, seems DesktopScaleFactor does have to have a struct provided to it. Here are the results of passing the property several different types:\n- ULONG throws HRESULT E_FAIL\n- SizeF (class) throws HRESULT E_FAIL\n- System.Windows.Size (struct) throws Value does not fall within the expected range\n- Color (struct) throws Value does not fall within the expected range. This at least confirms it wants a struct type, though I'm not sure the layout of the struct it expects.\n- Custom struct type still throws Value does not fall within the expected range. Tried calling it with a scaling factor like (2, 2) and with a desktop resolution like (3840, 2160).\n```csharp\nprivate struct ScaleFactor\n{\n    public ulong dX;\n    public ulong dY;\npublic ScaleFactor(ulong dx, ulong dy)\n{\n    dX = dx;\n    dY = dy;\n}\n\n}\n``\nI am able to retrieve the current value in theDesktopScaleFactor` property, but it always returns 0 (zero). At first I thought this might be a literal ULONG 0 value, but now it is more likely just a null pointer.\nWithout more advanced decompiling it might be impossible to tell what struct layout this property is expecting. I'm also not sure if this has a dependency on another property too. We may have to set another property to a certain value before this one is allowed to be set.\n@kmscode I know you are better with C/C++ than I am, would you be able to take a look or do you have any sleuthing tips for how to investigate this further?. I was able to find at least one usage of the scaling factor. I can't be 100% sure it takes the same struct type as the property, but it is likely given the argument naming is identical. If we can infer the types of each argument, I might be able to find the method in the disassembly based on the method signature.\nRDPEmulationMonitors(\nmonitorId,  <- int?\nLeftCoordinate,  <- int?\nTopCoordinate,  <- int?\nwidth,  <- int?\nheight,  <- int?\nphysicalWidth,  <- int?\nphysicalHeight,  <- int?\norientation,  <- struct or int?\ndesktopScaleFactor,  <- struct?\nmodernScaleFactor,  <- struct?\nflags  <- int?\n). Based on some FreeRdp code, it looks like the DesktopScaleFactor needs to be an int between 100 and 500 indicating the percentage of scaling.\n```c\nCommandLineSwitchCase(arg, \"scale-desktop\")\n{\n    unsigned long desktopScaleFactor = strtoul(arg->Value, NULL, 0);\nif (errno != 0)\n    return COMMAND_LINE_ERROR_UNEXPECTED_VALUE;\n\nif (desktopScaleFactor >= 100 && desktopScaleFactor <= 500)\n{\n    settings->DesktopScaleFactor = desktopScaleFactor;\n}\nelse\n{\n    WLog_ERR(TAG, \"scale:  invalid desktop scale factor (%d)\", desktopScaleFactor);\n    return COMMAND_LINE_ERROR;\n}\n\n}\n```. The final piece of the puzzle came from the RDP protocol specs. RDP connections now properly scale. I think this is the last major piece of the HiDPI feature that needed to be completed.\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn393534.aspx\nSpecifically:\n\nDesktopScaleFactor (4 bytes): A 32-bit, unsigned integer that specifies the desktop scale factor of the monitor. This value MUST be ignored if it is less than 100 percent or greater than 500 percent, or if DeviceScaleFactor is not 100 percent, 140 percent, or 180 percent.\nDeviceScaleFactor (4 bytes): A 32-bit, unsigned integer that specifies the device scale factor of the monitor. This value MUST be ignored if it is not set to 100 percent, 140 percent, or 180 percent or if DesktopScaleFactor is less than 100 percent or greater than 500 percent.<1> \n\n\nSet DesktopScaleFactor to the proper unsigned int scale percentage (between 100 and 500)\nSet DeviceScaleFactor to unsigned int 100 (not sure what 140 or 180 would do). This was quite a bit of work, but HiDPI is done! \ud83c\udf7e \ud83c\udf89 \n\nIt will be available in the first v1.77 alpha release (with hopefully few bugs).. I would say ~month is reasonable. Hopefully before the end of the year I can get the first alpha out.. - Keyboard shortcuts were removed due to stability issues. We hope to bring\nthem back in a future version.\n\n\nThe connections tree can be moved to where ever you would like. Just drag\nit\n\n\nDoes the tab switching issue always occur with SSH connections? If so,\nthis is a known issue due to PuTTY. See issue #181. Some rewrites of the connection tree have made this a bit easier to implement. Tentatively set for v1.76. We are doing some RDP upgrades in v1.77, might be able to fit this in as well. Duplicate ticket #539 has good examples/use cases in it. Took me a while to make the connection between these requests.. No release date has been set as of now. We might be able to get an early alpha build of 1.77 in a week or so, but development on this particular feature has not started yet.. As mentioned, this will be in v1.77. No release date has been set. We may be able to get around the click issue by overlaying some kind of click-catcher on top of the RDP session window. That overlay would capture click events and pass them on to the highest Z-order control under the click location (menu, RDP session, popup, etc).\n\n\nConcerns with this approach:\n- This adds some overhead to RDP sessions.\n- Adds a significant amount of complexity. The overlay would need to grow/shrink/move with its RDP session. The hit-testing could get complex pretty quickly.\n- This may not work anyways. It all depends on whether the RDP control has the necessary methods to support this kind of use case.\nPart of me thinks this approach would be kinda cool, and the other part of me is horrified at the idea of implementing it. @kmscode thoughts?. Unfortunately the RDP activex control doesn't make this easy. It's a black hole :(. Thanks for the report. We'll take a look at it. Can you elaborate more on what you would like? Putty settings can already be saved within Putty, and mRemoteNG allows you to select Putty profiles to use for a given connection.. Closing due to lack of response. Good catch. We'll look into this. The fix provided by @pedro2555 will be included in the patch 9 release shortly. Reopening this issue as a place to keep track of resolution progress for build 15002.. Created post to warn other users of this issue:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mRemoteNG/comments/5ncqz5/win10_insider_preview_build_15002_unstable/. This should be very do-able with the new connection tree. It already has support for advanced filter searching. We just have to turn it on / configure it.. Yea, this should be do-able for 1.76. Implementation is done, though there is a caveat to the filtering at the moment. Filtering only considers items that are currently expanded. If a folder is collapsed, its children are not considered in filtering. Because of this, I'm going to leave this issue open and try to come back to it later when I have more time.. On second thought, I'm going to close this issue and leave the filtering as-is. We will revisit if others find the above mentioned limitation a burden.. Related to #337\nThis was determined to most likely be an issue with the new insider build rather than mRemoteNG.. Closing this issue as duplicate. We have reopened the original ticket #337 as the master ticket for tracking this issue. Thanks for reporting this to us!. Just for completeness, there is a timed auto-save feature available in Tools -> Connections -> Auto save every [X] minutes.\nHowever, there is not an auto-save-after-every-change feature as @strike5150 is requesting.. I agree. It'd be worth looking into.. Yea np - taking a look.\nThese unit tests seem a bit fragile, wish there was a better way to keep them updated :(. \ud83d\udc4d  Everything looks good! Accepting this PR. Thanks for your work on this @countchappy! Grats on the 1st PR!. Might be able to add a jenkins task for updating that. Pull the ghpages branch, append to _data, commit/push. Does it sound do-able?. I'm failing to see the issue here as we are already signing all released dll/exe/msi files using a publicly trusted cert. The hashes we provide are really just a secondary verification for those who want it. It's trivial to provide the hashes - it's already part of the release process.. Ok, I see your point now. We will take that into consideration for future releases.. Hey, good idea. Haven't done that either, but shouldn't be too bad (famous last words).. Good points, thanks for sharing that Sean. It would be worth discussing further and doing some research on Github's stance.. Sorry it's taken me so long to review this. Comments incoming. @countchappy sorry... forgot to submit my review. it was sitting there for 4 days until Sean said he couldn't see it either :. Looks great now! I'm happy with the PR as it is. It's up to you if you'd like to add the localizations in as well, or do that later. We will be releasing 1.75 RC once this PR is done (probably this weekend).. @countchappy no problem! Thanks for taking the time to help out the project!. Step 4 is currently not possible without significantly changing PuTTY.\nWe may be able to look into this once PuTTY is replaced by SSH.Net (#181). We can take a look and see how they did it - thanks for the tip.. Ok, I see how they did it now. I forgot that putty changes the window name automatically when the current host changes. We should be able to do this fairly easily. This feature is being developed for v1.77. Reference:\nhttps://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vmrc/index.html. Dev notes\n2 ways we can proceed with this:\n\nTry to automate the installed version\nhttps://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VMRC10.0.2&productId=614\nDoes this support cmdline args?\nCreate a C# wrapper around the web SDK\nhttps://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/2.1.0/html-console\nhttps://www.vmware.com/support/developer/html-console/html-console-sdk-210-programmer-guide.pdf\n\nThe web SDK would be the best in the long run, but would require a significant amount of work.. Good to know about the web console.\nThe link you provided seems to be talking about automating the msi installer for VMRC, rather than automating VMRC itself.\nI haven't used VMRC myself - is it a little bit like vSphere for managing VMs?. Ok, that would be helpful. Thanks for the research @bignick8t3! That helps a lot . This will be fairly low priority for the moment unless someone is willing to submit a PR. down/up arrows can be used to move through the list of matches. Might be worth having a UI element for next/previous search though.. No worries @abma . We need to make it more obvious that that feature is available.. I'm not even sure why we have an option for Always show panel tabs, tbh. Having it not checked leads to poor UX in some cases (like this one). My vote it to remove the Always show panel tabs option and have it always show the tabs. At the very least, it should be defaulted to checked (to show the tabs).. Whatever was going on in v1.72, I can't seem to replicate this in any v1.75 build. Are you able to replicate on newer versions?. Looks like it works as advertised.\n@kmscode any issues with this change?. @kmscode Requesting a quick review from you before merging this into develop for release with 1.75.. duplicate of #176 . Not sure why I didn't close this when I last posted. Please follow #176 for further updates. Makes sense, good suggestion!. Also able to confirm. The first click after activating an SSH connection seems to be viewed as a double click, but only within the tree. Double clicking an RDP connection then single clicking something does not have the same effect (treated correctly as a single click).. Uh... odd. Here's what i'm seeing:\n\nDouble click an ssh connection (single click executes, double click executes - this is expected)\nSingle click another ssh connection (double click executes)\nMouse over a treelist item (single click claims that it executes)\n\nStep 2 is obviously wrong, but I also didn't expect step 3 to occur. . This feels like a bug in ObjectListView, since we're hooking into their CellClicked event. Will have to test with their source to confirm.. Re-implementing the same functionality using standard events does not produce the bug. This strongly points to ObjectListView as the cause.. Pushed the fix to the 1.75 RC branch. A fix will be included in the next release.\nThanks for the report!. We aren't planning on removing putty, it just won't be the default ssh provider. We still intend on supporting putty for the long term. @SteNeo I think @abma was referring to the VNC server that is installed on the remote host.. @SteNeo Have you had a chance to try upgrading VNC server? Is this issue still present?. Closing this issue. Feel free to re-open if you have further concerns. @siddjoshi Any updates on this issue? Still occurring?. @siddjoshi I'm going to closing this ticket as it seems to be an environment issue. Feel free to reach out again if you need more community help. Serverfault.com may be a good resource as well. Use %!Password% (notice the exclamation mark) to disable meta character escaping in passwords.\nMore details on this page:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#shell-metacharacter-escaping. Closing this issue. Feel free to re-open if you have further concerns. Duplicate of #268 \n@drocca69 Feel free to subscribe to notifications for that ticket to receive updates for this issue.. Currently, connection files exported from mRemoteNG are not valid to import into mRemoteNG. This is working as designed (it's a legacy thing..). However, there is currently no technical reason for this to be the case. We should be able to take this on as a feature request to allow mremoteng exports to be importable.. You are right - exported files were importable in previous versions. It was only the regular (non-exported) mRemoteNG files that were not importable.\nSeems there was a small bug where the \"export\" flag was not set on the exported confcons file. The app checks for this \"export\" flag to be set and will disallow import if it is not set. Changing the exported xml file and setting export=\"true\" should provide a work around.\nThe \"export\" flag bug is now fixed in commit f419bff and will be available in the next release (1.75, either RC or final). There is also no long any reason to do this check, so the code that checks for the export flag will be removed in the next version.\nSorry if I caused any confusion over this issue.. Yep, this is resolved in the current stable release. The password protect option (seen when clicking the \"Connections\" tree node) just allows you to set a custom encryption password. By default, mRemoteNG uses a default password for encryption (bad). There is a different option to enable full file encryption - it sounds like that is what you are looking for. I think for v1.74 that was located in Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Completely encrypt connection file.\nEncryption got a minor update in v1.75 (stable release coming soon).\nThe entire credential management system is being overhauled for v1.76. No problem, happy to help!. It was probably a design decision at the time, but I agree that it has some unintended consequences in your case. We will look at changing that, or at least making it an option that multilingual teams can turn off.. Closing as duplicate issue. It was also found that KB2574819 is required and that install order of KB2574819 and KB2592687 seems to matter.\nSee this article for more details:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#classnotreg. Unfortunately both KB2574819 and either KB2592687 or KB2923545 must be applied for the current RDP version to work. We could look into adding an option to downgrade the RDP version of a connection record, but this might take a bit of work to implement.. I don't think we will ever implement an official feature to do this. I think that by providing an official implementation, it would be an explicit stamp of approval by mRemoteNG as an organization. This might cause some organizations to view mRemoteNG in a negative light.\nWith that said, however... I'm not opposed to users creating this for themselves. I think this could be done as a 3rd party plugin, once we have a framework to do that (#976).. Hey @rheingold! Thanks for the PR, sorry it's taken so long for anyone to get back to you about it.\nI plan on taking a look at it tomorrow (as long as nothing unexpected comes up).. I think I steered you wrong when I told you to update the mRemoteNG.exe.config with the new SupportedUICulture entry. My bad :(\nCould you update mRemoteV1\\app.config to include cs-CZ in the SupportedUICultures entry?\nOnce this is done we should be ready to merge.. Hey all, ill try to get and update out this week. It'll be prioritized\nOn Mar 7, 2017 8:44 AM, \"Totorman\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWaiting the updated MSSQL script like a fool here too ! :)\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/408#issuecomment-284759287,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGrNlks1WHCWv9U5OJ9YROWXHrK_6xAdks5rjXtggaJpZM4MHB7Q\n.\n. I think I have this worked out. I'll release it on the Development update channel today if you'd like to test it out. mRemoteNG should be able to update your DB columns automatically.. A fix is now available on the Development channel. Please let me know if this resolves the issue. @ConnorLinfoot Could you run the following on your mRemoteNG db and paste the results here? Just to verify - your mRemoteNG version is 1.75.7002?\n\nsql\nselect ORDINAL_POSITION,COLUMN_NAME,DATA_TYPE\nfrom INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\nwhere TABLE_NAME = 'tblCons'. Thanks Connor - 1 more query for you. Given the columns present in the last output, your confversion should show 2.5.  If it's 2.6, we'll need to modify that.\nsql\nselect ConfVersion\nfrom tblroot. Yea, push that back to 2.5. Then when you run mRemoteNG again, it should auto-alter the columns to be 2.6 compatible. Good to hear the writing is working now. Whats the error on import? Anything in the log?\nYea, sounds like the sql reload is causing the deselection.. Log locations for your edition: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\nYea, we'll need to look into a usability fix for the deselection bug.. @ConnorLinfoot I'm looking into the import failures you reported. Few questions:\n\nWhat is the confCons version of the .xml file?\nIs the \"Export\" attribute set to \"True\"?. @ConnorLinfoot Due to an unrelated bug, you will need to set the Export property to \"True\" on the xml file.\n\nFound out what was going on with the import crash. More details in #464. @countchappy Sorry, the failing test was my fault \ud83d\ude41.\nIt was a brittle test to begin with, so I've fixed it for good now (it was making another PR fail for no good reason too).. Hey @countchappy ! Just wanted to check in and let you know we haven't forgotten about your PR. Thanks again for submitting it!. From the build log:\n\nConnection\\ConnectionInfo.cs(292,124): error CS1061: 'Settings' does not contain a definition for 'ConDefaultRedirectAudioInput' and no extension method 'ConDefaultRedirectAudioInput' accepting a first argument of type 'Settings' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?). There was a bug in that version when seeializing the export file.

I think this is the same as #479. I'll close this one as the duplicate since we have a PR open on the other.. Thanks for the report @AlacrityF42 , we will look into this.. @digitalexpl0it In #704 the portable version was changed to save program settings in the same directory as mremoteng.exe. Would you consider that a valid fix for the issues you are seeing? Or would you like us to keep this open to add the option to save settings to AppData\\Roaming?. Great! This will be available in v1.76. This may be possible by creating a setting to toggle the IMsTscAdvancedSettings.DisableRdpdr property. The downside is that this seems to also disable printer redirection along with the clipboard.\n\nMore details:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa381808(v=vs.85).aspx. This feature will be avialable in v1.77. Thanks to @CrAbelleira for providing the pull request!. This is possible for some tools by checking the Try to integrate checkbox. Not all tools can be successfully integrated into mRemoteNG tabs.. We can look into using SetParent, though it can cause odd issues (like the window focus bugs we see when using PuTTY).. I'm going to tag this ticket as a \"feature request\" for trying to improve the window integration feature.. I'm not able to replicate the issue. Can you give me some more details? Did you have any connections open? If so, which connection was currently active on the screen? Do you know which portion of the application had focus?. Thanks for the report @ysqi we will get this updated. Script has been updated. All COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS have been removed. If I'm understanding correctly, this is already possible using PuTTY to set up a SOCKS4 tunnel. Admittedly, this requires a bit more work to setup and use on a daily basis.\nMaking this a more integrated feature of RDP connections would be possible but a bit more difficult using PuTTY directly. It is suggested that we complete #181 first and build this feature with SSH.Net.. Ok, on a second pass I see the issue you're bringing up. The library we use for RDP (mstsclib) doesn't natively support any proxy type besides RD Gateway.\nWe will need to find a library that provides SOCKS/HTTP proxy support. If you know of a good library let us know and we can look into it.. I agree this would be a great feature to have. However, I am not sure when I will have the time to implement it. We will likely need someone to submit a PR to get it done in any reasonable amount of time.. In short, we don't have enough developer time to do this right now. It would be great to have this, but there are many other significant features that are ahead of this one. (HiDPI, credential manager, hotkeys, just to name a few). And that's not even taking into consideration that all feature work is on hold until v1.76 is released. Bug fixes are getting priority.\nWe need some more developers :(. Actually you've uncovered something pretty interesting here. VNC actually doesn't have any proxy support in the app. The proxy settings for VNC connections aren't hooked up to anything except serializers/deserializers. They don't actually do anything at the moment. I'm not even sure why those properties exist, except maybe the implementation just wasn't completed.\nThis still means the property serialization/deserialization work is mostly done, but we still need to create the actual proxy implementations.. Absolutely. Any connection type that supports TCP should also be usable with the TCP proxy (regardless of implementation details).. I agree, it isn't very user friendly. I'm going to tentatively schedule this for v1.76.\nThe goal will be to replace any \"could not load startup file\" dialogs with a \"what would you like to do\" dialog. Options would be:\n- Create a new connection file\n- Load a different connection file\n- Exit. Some improvements were provided by @brucetp that should alleviate this issue. You will be able to choose what to do when a connection file cannot be loaded, rather than the app forcibly exiting.. Fix will be available in the next release. Cant believe I never encountered this error over months of testing : . Yea, we may end up doing that. This one is annoying, but the app will continue working without issue by clicking 'continue'. We'll wait a few days to ensure we didnt miss any other bugs.. @kmscode \ud83d\udc4d that would be great. cancelling. Resolved the issue. This fix will be available in the 1.75 hotfix 1 release that will be released in a few days.. Closing as duplicate of #422 \nA fix will be released in the next few days. Looks good, accepting the PR. Thanks for the PR @rheingold !. Resolved under #422 \nThis fix will be available in a day or two. I am not able to replicate the issues described here in either xml or sql based connections in the latest 1.76 alpha release. @TehDuffman @Totorman Would either of you be willing to verify this? https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.76Alpha2. Thanks @Totorman. I'm closing out this issue, but if anyone has issues with this in the v1.76 builds please reopen. @jtown84 Could you provide the mremoteng.log file (or at least the last few entries from it)?\nAlso, have you tried loading a backup?. Ok, hopefully the log file has some details about what happened.. I'm going to close this issue since it is pretty old. @jtown84 feel free to reopen if necessary. Scheduling for 1.76. Moved the fix up in the schedule - we will release this with 1.75 hotfix 5 (should be this week)\nResolved in commit 1520b8b. Closing as duplicate of #408. Subscribe to that issue for updates. It just so happens I was looking into this today while trying to finish up #408 \nI think I have a fix ready. I'll release it on the Development update channel today if you'd like to test it out.. A fix is now available on the Development channel. Please let me know if this resolves the issue. @tommybuck Can you run the following sql on your mRemoteNG db and provide the output here?\nsql\nselect COLUMN_NAME,ORDINAL_POSITION\nfrom INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\nwhere TABLE_NAME = 'tblCons'. Thanks for that - think I've found a better solution for the problem now. I'll push another update.. Another update was pushed to the Development channel. Hoping this will do it.\nThe previous code seemed to be relying on column ordering for doing bulk DB inserts. We're now matching up column names which should be much safer. Awesome! Glad to hear :). Yep, we can definitely do that.. In fact, this may be taken care of in v1.76 anyways since we're redoing the credential management system.. Related to #208. v1.77 will be a good time to tackle this since we will be finally implementing the credential manager feature. We can add encrypted shared passwords stored in the DB at the same time.. I've had to do some db work for a v1.76 hotfix, so I'm going to pull this ahead to v1.76 as well. This will be available in v1.76.12. Awesome! I should have time to review it either tonight or tomorrow. I can take a look. I believe this may be a duplicate of #449, which will be fixed in v1.76.12. If this is not the same issue, please feel free to reopen this issue. Verified that it works on my machine as well. I do encounter a separate app crash when closing mRemoteNG though. This only happens if I've opened/closed an Https session that has a cert override. Nothing in the logs. Occurs in both portable and normal editions.\n\nThe following was found in event viewer:\n\nFaulting application name: plugin-container.exe, version: 45.0.1.6004, time stamp: 0x5759b02e\nFaulting module name: mozglue.dll, version: 45.0.1.6004, time stamp: 0x5759aebc\nException code: 0x80000003\nFault offset: 0x000025ff\nFaulting process id: 0x1058\nFaulting application start time: 0x01d29cf0f12e6ae6\nFaulting application path: C:\\Users\\\\Documents\\Repositories\\mRemoteNG_Project\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\bin\\Debug Portable\\Firefox\\plugin-container.exe\nFaulting module path: C:\\Users\\\\Documents\\Repositories\\mRemoteNG_Project\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\bin\\Debug Portable\\Firefox\\mozglue.dll\nReport Id: 344b3849-08e4-11e7-a6ee-185e0fa915b8.

Do you have KB2923545 installed? \n\nKB2592687 (RDP 8.0) or KB2923545 (RDP 8.1) are required for using RDP connections..

Seems to be working well. We now look for (KB2574819 && (KB2592687 || KB2830477))\n@kmscode what do you think of including this with hotfix5?. Sounds good - let's include this. Yep, the wiki and a few other places will need to be updated. The Panel property of the default connection record is now saved to settings. This will be released in the next major release v1.76. I plan on adding options to control the backup settings from the regular Options pages in the next major release (v1.77). That work will be pretty quick and easy.. @Torys87 Can you please provide more details such as:\n- do you receive an error when trying to create a connection?\n- what version of mRemoteNG are you using?\n- are you using the experimental SQL feature?. Closing due to lack of response. Note for posterity: this is a regression from previous behavior.. Accepted PR by @pfjason. This will be included in v1.76. Found the issue - fix should be available in the next v1.76 alpha release. Thanks for the PR!\nI should have time to review sometime this week.. Yep, seems to work ok when targeted on the master branch. Something on the develop branch is screwing with it.. I think i found what was causing the abnormalities. There was a series of event calls that was causing a high number of host ping checks. I removed the call and the BeginEdit() call seems to be snappy now. Accepting this PR as it currently is.. The last version of RDCMan files that was supported was v2.2. We are hoping to add this feature in the next major release.\nClosing as duplicate #225 . Just to confirm, is user/password/domain inheritance set on the connection? Also, which version of mRemoteNG are you running?. I am seeing a bug with the display of inheritance options for folders/connections that are direct children of the root node. These should not have inheritance as an option.\nExample:\n- Connections (the root node)\n   - Connection1\n   - Folder1\n       - Connection2\nWe should not be able to set inheritance on Connection1 and Folder1 - the button should be greyed out and the inheritance should be completely off. Currently, we can set inheritance. I'd consider this a bug.\n\nIt appears that after I exit mRemote and launch it again that there are extra characters added to the password.\n\n@TechGuy419  Not able to replicate this at the moment. Are you using the SQL feature, or saving to an xml file?. Just to confirm, your set up before the work around was:\n\nConnections (root)\nSomeFolder (inheriting user/pass/domain). Ahh I think I see now. You set the user/pass/domain settings on the default connection info (highlighted in orange):\n\n. @JangoBritt Here is a quick guide that will walk you through the process: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Folders-and-Inheritance. @TechGuy419 I've found the bug that is causing the incorrect default connection info password. I'll try to get something worked up for our next round of bug fixes.. @kmscode The issue happens when loading the ConDefaultPassword string from the user settings file. We read the encrypted string up and store it in the DefaultConnectionInfo object without decrypting it.\n\nDefaultConnectionInfo.cs, somewhere around line 31/33. Since the default connectioninfo object is saved to the user settings file, the framework is handling the load/save of the string for us. The DefaultConnectionInfo then loads (just copies) data from the settings class to populate the singleton connectioninfo object. That's why I suggest that the root of the issue is in the DefaultConnectionInfo.cs file - though I guess it isn't quite the simple now that I type all that out...\nI agree with your points around how to fix the issue. Either decrypt at load-time or decrypt it on each use. I created a class mRemoteNG.Security.EncryptedSecureString for making these sorts of things a little easier but ended up not using it. Maybe this would be a decent way to go?\nWe would probably want to modify the class a bit since it originally didn't support loading ciphertext strings. Maybe rename SetValue(string value) to SetValueFromPlainText(string plainText) and add a method SetValueFromCipherText(string cipherText) that just doesn't do the call to Encrypt.. Rearranging some initialize code seems to take care of the problem as well. Created #724 to show the fix. I'm in favor of swapping out the string for an EncryptedSecureString (or something similar) that takes care of the encrypt/decrypt for us, but this is the simplest code sample that resolves the problem.\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Click on the Connections root node, and select the Default Properties button\n1. Set the Password field (asdf123)\n1. Close and reopen mRemoteNG\n1. Create a new connection\n1. The password of the new connection will be a long Base64 encoded string. We expect to have the plain-text string (obfuscated with dot characters).. I'm going to close this issue as the problem should be resolved with #724 (released with patch 9). Just to confirm, can you please provide the exact version number of the build you are running?. Thanks for confirming - \nRun the following 2 queries on your sql instance and paste the output here:\nsql\nselect ORDINAL_POSITION,COLUMN_NAME,DATA_TYPE\nfrom INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\nwhere TABLE_NAME = 'tblCons'\nsql\nselect ConfVersion\nfrom tblRoot. Thanks - that data looks as it should for this version. I'm not able to reproduce the error on sql server 2012. I'll get 2016 set up and give that a go. In the meantime, could you also provide the mremoteng.log file?\nLog file details can be found here if you need.\n. Thanks for that - it helps narrow down a little bit. This is likely a LINQ query that is failing. So the error is likely being thrown from one of several places:\n- DataTableSerializer.Serialize() : line 28\n- DataTableDeserializer.CreateNodeHierarchy() : line 183, 188\nI'll try to recreate the issue as that will give the best chance of finding the root cause.. I still wasn't able to recreate the issue on a live system, but I added some more safety checking in the sections that I think are causing the problem. There were a few \"brittle\" sections that should handle unexpected situations better now.\nIf you are able to build from source, the new changes are available on the branch 483_make_datatable_serializer_safer. Otherwise, I'm hoping we will have a new minor/hotfix release out this next week.. Closing this issue for now. We need to redo much of the database handling code anyways since it is so unstable. Yep we can do that - should be a pretty quick change.. Domain is now available on connection records with protocol of Int App. In the next major version (v1.76), the portable version will save its settings in the same directory as mRemoteNG.exe. Deferring this issue to v1.77. This will be resolved by #826 - we will no longer need to have requirements checked in the installer. I believe it was designed this way (to only use the default user/pass when connecting to the machine), or maybe was just an oversight. I'm going to tag this as a \"feature request\" since nothing is technically broken, though I agree that we should expect the default credentials to be available everywhere in the application.. resolved in commit 6dcef71\nThe backup code was using using UTC in the backup name. I've changed this to use local system time.. We would like to be able to support higher version, however any version of the RFB protocol over 3.8 (such as the version used by RealVNC) are proprietary. Licensing the use of the newer protocols may be cost-prohibitive - though it has been a while since I checked into it. Closing as duplicate of #479. Please follow that ticket for updates. No problem :+1:. resolved this - it will be available in 1.76. This fix was moved up and is available as of v1.75.7009. Thank Gyuha!\nSorry for the long delay. Accepting this PR now. Closing as duplicate of #338. Please follow that ticket for updates. We agree! Though there is a request for this already - follow #326 for updates. Glad you like the tool!\nClosing as duplicate of #326. . We now no longer prevent importing normal mremoteng connection files. This error message should no longer show up.. Thanks for adding your report here. Yea, there are a number of very annoying focus-related issues in the application. I don't believe we have these issues scheduled yet, but they are on our mind.. @jcefoli give this branch a try - verify that the post build actions complete successfully. If it's working well for you, we will merge this PR.. Resolved this under #442 - the fix will be released this week in hotfix 5.. hotfix 5 released on the development update channel. The fix provided by @dekelMP will be included in the patch 9 release coming shortly.. I'm able to reproduce the issue. I'll try to get a fix in place this week. Found roughly where the issue is.

Yep i think you are right. Must have mis-copied it. Thanks for the report @jupsoleil \nHmm - yes it might be a permissions issue. If so, we should remove the line about tagging your own issue tickets with bug/request. Thanks for bringing that up as well. Thanks for sharing your workaround @Spankachu!. We are going to be updating the .net framework version targeted by the project in v1.76. .Net framework 4.6 has some improvements to high dpi scaling that we are hoping to use. You can follow #321 for more general info about this. Yes, this will very likely be resolved with the HiDPI support we have added in v1.77. Unfortunately no, we don't know when the next version will be released.. Hi @joelharkes, glad to hear that you want to contribute!\nHere is our guide for getting your development environment set up:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Development-Environment\nThe DLLs shown in your screenshot are related to Citrix Receiver, which must be installed in order to build the program.. Closing as duplicate of #176. Please follow that issue for updates. Thanks for the report - we will take a look. All these options have trade-offs, and you as the user can determine which trade-offs you prefer. However, if you don't want dead space / scroll bars and want to preserve the aspect ratio of the connection, you must reconnect. That is a limitation of the RDP protocol.\n\nResolution: Fit to Panel and Automatic Resize: Yes\nEnsures no dead space or scroll bars when connecting or resizing connection window\nPreserves aspect ratio\nRequires reconnect when connection window size changes\nResolution: Fit to Panel and Automatic Resize: No\nEnsures no dead space or scroll bars when initially connecting\nResizing connection window will create dead space or scroll bars\nPreserves aspect ratio\nDoes not require reconnect when connection window size changes\nResolution: Smart Size\nEnsures no dead space or scroll bars when connecting or resizing connection window\nDoes not preserve aspect ratio (stretches the image to fill the window)\nDoes not require reconnect when connection window size changes\nResolution: [Width] x [Height]\nInitial connection may have dead space or scroll bars\nResizing connection window will create dead space or scroll bars\nPreserves aspect ratio\nDoes not require reconnect when connection window size changes. Yea, I've noticed it takes a long time to reconnect too. We call the built-in \"Reconnect\" method when resizing the connection. It might go faster if we do a disconnect / connect instead of using the built in reconnect. I opened #1152 to investigate that option. I didn't realize that an earlier issue existed for this request until now. #327 is essentially the same request. In the interest of keeping our ticket queue in order, I'm going to close this issue as a duplicate. Please follow issue #327 for further updates.\n\nThank you to everyone for the good examples/conversation. This ticket will help when we do get around to implementing this.. Requires plugin:\n- HTML Publisher plugin\nEdit /etc/sysconfig/jenkins and add the following line to the JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS variable:\n-Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP=\"default-src 'none'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\"\nThe entire JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS variable should read:\nJENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP=\\\"default-src 'none'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\\\"\"\nRestart the jenkins service to apply the new CSP setting.. Good find - this one should be a pretty quick fix too. @mrwulf that sounds good to me. Merged fix provided by @mrwulf. This will be available in the next patch. We will look into it. Passphrases can already be set by clicking on the Connections tree node and setting \"Password\" to yes. Is this what you were looking for?. > Good corporate practice would therefore be :\nTools > Options > Security tab > Completely encrypt connection file\nConnections tree node > set Password protect to Yes\nYes those settings would be the most secure. The most important of them is setting \"password protect\" to yes. There is no simple way to defeat the security of the file when that is set.. Np! Happy to help. Thanks @polluks , merging now. Thanks for the PR @vbfox! merged. Looks good to me, thanks for taking the time to implement this @vbfox. You can rebase on develop now since i've accepted #557. \nThe only thing I could think to add to this is an option for allowing users to toggle between current functionality and your new setup (with the play icon overlay). If we want to go this route, it might be worth refactoring the ConnectionTree class a bit to allowing plugging in different image list implementations. We could then keep the old implementation as-is and move your implementation to a new class. Let me know what you think.\n@kmscode any comments on this PR?. This PR is directly related to #326. Yea, the rebase might not be necessary. @kmscode If there are no objections, I'll to the merge today.. > I don't feel the need for an option for the old functionality. The icon setting seemed way under used. This corrects that as far as I'm concerned.\n\nOn the setting I can add it but i'm not sure anyone would want to remove the icon (Maybe i'm biased), still can add if the change is too annoying.\n\nI've been surprised in the past about people wanting old functionality. I'm good with accepting the PR as is. If we ever need to re-implement the old style we can always dig through the old code. You are both probably right that no one will complain.\n\nOn the refactoring I think i'll try to refactor to get to a point where the icon can be in the file/db.\nMy target is to do the same as KeePass: A fixed set of icons provided in the app and the user can also import icons that are then stored in the file/db (So they are shared if the file is shared and we can use technology-specific icons for servers)\n\n@vbfox I like that idea. Would be a good enhancement for the next PR (if you care to do it).. We will take a look at adding those. Thanks for reporting this - I'll take a look at it. Seems this was an issue specific to Win10. This has now been corrected in our installer. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44161526/wix-copying-new-files-file-1-directory-9-size-6-shown-during-instal. Created https://openhatch.org/projects/mRemoteNG. Gotcha, good find. It seems their dynamic bug crawler doesn't work, or doesn't work quickly anyways. Profile is up on the site, so this is probably as done as it will get. This is due to a required update not being installed.  The following article has more details:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#classnotreg. @ZypherFighting I'm closing this issue for now - though feel free to reopen it if you are still running into issues.. Thanks for the PR @peterchenadded ! Looks good to me and thanks for writing some unit tests for it as well. Merging. Hmm, we could do that. The question would be, do we:\n\nAllow the groups to nest infinitely (like the connections tree). You can place external tools within folders and nest them however you would like or...\nLimit it to one folder deep and then we could just have an assignable \"Category\" property on each external tool. Each \"Category\" would then become a folder and tools without a category set would not be in a folder.\n\nAt the moment I would lean toward the second option.. We can look into it. I remember there was a similar request proposed a while ago, but I can't seem to find the ticket now.. We are getting ready to do a minor release to the built in putty for some upstream security fixes. @kmscode is a bit more familiar with the puttyng code than I am - he might be able to comment.. Hi @MVmatthew  sorry for such a delay at getting back to you. What is the ConfVersion of the connections file that you tried to open?\n(You can check the ConfVersion by opening the connections file in a text editor and look at the end of the 2nd line of text.). Done, but there is an ugly color difference around the checkbox on the last install screen. This will be a bit of a pain to fix:\nhttp://windows-installer-xml-wix-toolset.687559.n2.nabble.com/How-to-change-background-color-behind-the-checkbox-last-install-page-td3751984.html. Added in commit 3f6b572. Hey all - taking a look at this now. I've reopened it. Closing as duplicate of #583 - we are working on this. completed in #677. Thanks for sharing that @igor2x \n@jasonhpchu Sorry for the delay, I haven't been able to keep up with everything lately. We can certainly look into performance tuning for the built in vnc. Or at least expose some more options that allow for tuning. It might take us a bit to get to it though.. These were failing pretty regularly and we dont use the reports much, so I've just removed the upload reports step entirely. Implemented a fix for this that will be available in the next patch. Duplicate of #503 - please subscribe/like that issue for further updates. Thanks!. Related to #606 . Thanks for catching that @igor2x! I'll update that as well.. Updated the relevant url. I took a quick look at this and think I know why this is happening.\nIn IeBrowserEmulation.Register():201 we get some sort of exception - not great but we should be able to handle it. We catch the exception as expected, but the issue comes in line IeBrowserEmulation.Register():205.

The bad news is that it wasn't originally scheduled for release until v1.76. We can look into cherry-picking the necessary changes into a patch.. No problem! We will still plan to resolve this issue in a patch in case others run into the same problem.. Added a work around fix for the next patch (check MessageCollector for null).\nA better fix (initialize the MessageCollector earlier in the startup sequence) will be included in the next major release.. This feature will be available in v1.76. Thanks for the detailed report! Although I think this is a duplicate of #529 - please subscribe to that issue for further updates.. Duplicate of #600 - please follow that issue for further updates. I agree with not including version numbers in the credits file. Keeping that file updated when external components are updated is extra tedious work. If we want to have a way for folks to quickly check component versions we could create a screen within mRemoteNG to inspect them dynamically (similar to the current Component Check screen, just expanded).\n@kmscode thoughts?. @philippgille Its in the root level folder along with the Readme.md file. It's in all caps for some reason CREDITS.TXT, which might have thrown off your search.. Thanks for sharing your findings @johnjore!. Thanks for the report @mj9652 \nIs the mouse cursor an acceptable size when using the built-in Remote Desktop Connection program for rdp?. @o-l-a-v I think #178 is more what you are thinking of. This issue seems to be related to minimizing mRemoteNG itself.\nClosing this issue due to lack of response from the OP. to my knowledge, the minimize to taskbar feature is working as intended.. Pushing this out to v1.76 since this will require new functionality. Feeling good about the implementation now. The csv file format had to change a bit since we weren't saving folders completely, just the names. Here are the highlights:\n\nContainers (folders) are now serialized completely\nWe now save both the GUID of the connection and the GUID of its parent so they can be recomposed correctly during deserialization\nAdded some inheritance properties that were missing from the serializer\n\nThis will be included in the next v1.76 pre-release. Look in the output window for the build, there may be a powershell script error. It might not have found a valid microsoft tool for editbin.exe or dumpbin.exe (needed for setting and validating the LargeAddressAware flag on the exe).\nIf that is what is causing the failure then we can look at a few ways to resolve.. @daniel-le9000 The changes in this PR are a good starting point to get the basic functionality implemented. To ensure the property behaves correctly in other parts of the app, you will also need to make modifications in the areas I called out in my review comment above.\n\n\nMultiMonitor is showing up in the config window for any tree node type. It should only be shown for connectioninfos or containerinfos whose protocol is \"RDP\". Look in mRemoteNG.UI.Window.ConfigWindow.ShowHideGridItems() for how to do this\nNeed to implement an inheritance property for MultiMonitor (mRemoteNG.Connection.ConnectionInfoInheritance)\nNeed to implement ConDefaultMultiMonitor and InhDefaultMultiMonitor in the Property\\Settings.settings file to support serializing default connection info data for this property\n\n\nIn that comment I also forgot to mention that the serializers/deserializers need to be updated to include the property.. Closing this PR in favor of #1150 . No one closed it :P. Thanks for the fix!. Looks like we will need to update VncSharp to expose the Depth property.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/VncSharp/blob/master/VncSharp/Framebuffer.cs#L89. Very cool - thanks for submitting @mrwulf!\nI will hopefully have some time to take a deeper look at this tonight and offer comments.. Looks good now. I'll need to talk with @kmscode quick about which branch to target though. We generally don't push/pr directly into master. We might be able to push this into either a new branch or maybe a patch/smaller deployment.. @mrwulf I went through some of the merge conflicts an tried to get things working again. Take a look at the following patch of the proposed changes:\npatch.diff.txt\n. Also, just noticed that the PuTTYNG.exe file is different. What version is it?\nDisregard this, forgot I had switched the branches. Merged this to develop in commit c4fdf07. - What is the version of mRemoteNG?\n\nWhat is the ConfVersion of your connections file? You can check this by opening your confCons.xml file in a text editor. It will look something like this:\nxml\n<Connections Name=\"Connections\" Export=\"False\" EncryptionEngine=\"AES\" BlockCipherMode=\"GCM\" KdfIterations=\"1000\" FullFileEncryption=\"False\" Protected=\"rJGzXAzCwYztIx7xWO22AemSd8HPLAROXRpE75rsDcXR3muGzWULMQq/0YQZJs+gpz9IRTVBOyZB481GUVxM/ACy\" ConfVersion=\"2.6\">. Implemented and will be available in the next v1.76 alpha. Vielen Dank!. Looks good! I'm going to merge this into the Patch9 branch instead of master though. Going to merge this one into Patch9 as well\n\nThanks for the PRs!. This is likely related to a change made yesterday #653 \n@benwa can you look into this?. The potential fix submitted by @pedro2555 will be release in patch 9 shortly. Please reopen this issue if the new update does not resolve the issue. ConnectionInfos now only know about credential guids.\nNeed to fix how credentials are displayed in the config window:\n - [x] if a credential id exists, the credential should be provided to the config window to display as a complex object (users can modify the credential from the config window)\n- [x] if a credential id does not exist for a connection info, display a message that no credential is associated and provide a drop down to select from the set of currently loaded credentials. Fix serialization:\n- [x] the CredentialId field is being serialized with \"mRemoteNG.Tools.Maybe1[System.Guid]\" instead of the guid (or empty string)\n- [x] deserializing a guid does not seem to create the correct Maybe<Guid>. Or it might be getting corrupted at some point.. To get around some reflection issues in the FilteredPropertyGrid, each connection still has an ICredentialRecord reference. However, these references are proxied from the credential manager and never saved in a connection record directly. This will be a little confusing from the API side of things, since connections also have a CredentialRecordId property that is used for serialization. At some point this should get cleaned up, but we will need to ditch the reflection-based property window before that happens.. This enhancement is resolved and merged intodevelop` in commit 1c7592c70711f576ac237e985ac6e18d9d4ff261. Loading a separate confcons file during upgrade will take a bit of refactoring. The current upgrade implementation hijacks the deserialization process (decorator). To open a new file we would need to somehow break out of the deserialization process and stop whatever other logic was supposed to run in order to restart the entire \"load connection file\" workflow with the new confcon file.. I believe this is resolved by #155 and #1258. Connections can now be moved and docked in whatever configuration you would like.. It will be available in v1.77. We are getting ready to release an alpha version hopefully by the end of February.. Hopefully I can answer with an example that causes problems in our current implementation.\nI have some connections saved in the db. For each of these connections, admins should be logging in with their own domain credentials. If I save the credentials I want to use, it is shared to everyone in the tblCons table. We could solve this by saying \"never save your credentials when using sql\" but then what would be the point of using mRemoteNG with a database? The problem doesn't go away when we start using the credential manager either. We would be saving a guid with a particular connection record, but that guid is unique to the credential that I want to use. It wouldn't be valid for another admin that wanted to use that connection.\nThe solution is to add another level of indirection. We allow proxy credentials to be assigned to connections saved in the db and allow users to assign a local credential to the proxy credential. This allows for a shared model (generic but meaningful placeholder credentials) that can be customized on a per-user basis.\nAs a more concrete example of how I see this working:\n1. I create a new folder in our shared connections tree\n1. I then create a new proxy credential called \"Foo Domain - Staging\" and assign it to the new folder I created\n1. Now I assign my personal credential for the \"foo\" staging domain to that \"Foo Domain - Staging\" proxy credential\n1. When I start a connection that inherits from that folder it will look to the \"Foo Domain - Staging\" credential and be redirected to the personal credential that I assigned to it.\n\nI am thinking of SQL as just another provider (like keepass for exaple)\n\nThis is definitely possible too. Though I may suggest that users look into dedicated secrets-management solutions for storing shared passwords. I'd even prefer to just never support storing credentials in the mRemoteNG database.. Hi @garyhahn sorry that cause you some grief - we've noticed that the layout can become corrupted during an upgrade and we haven't yet figured out why. Glad it didn't discourage you!. Completed in commit b4c535c76a740505aeb73915c0f444a37b74920d. Resolved by @pedro2555 \nThe fix will be available in the next release. Related to #594. For specifying a credential, we should allow both the full GUID and a truncated 7-character id similar to how Git handles commit ids. This still allows us 15^7 unique entries, making collisions within a single user's credential set very unlikely. Allowing truncated ids will greatly increase the readability of external tool configs.. We can now explicitly specify credential records in external tools USERNAME, DOMAIN, PASSWORD arguments when using the following syntax: %property:cred_id%.\nThe cred_id portion refers to the GUID assigned to each credential object. It must be provided at least 7 characters of the ID, but it can be as many as you would like to provide, up to the maximum 32 characters present in a GUID. Including dashes (-) is fine - they will be stripped out when doing the lookup. The ID is case-insensitive. Normal meta-character escaping applies just like normal replacement variables.\nExamples include:\n- %USERNAME:D1C198F4-57D7-4F48-808F-E1724BECB291%\n- %USERNAME:D1C198F457D74F48808FE1724BECB291%\n- %USERNAME:D1C198F%\n- %DOMAIN:D1C198F4-57D7-4F48-808F-E1724BECB291%\n- %DOMAIN:D1C198F457D74F48808FE1724BECB291%\n- %DOMAIN:D1C198F%\n- %PASSWORD:D1C198F4-57D7-4F48-808F-E1724BECB291%\n- %PASSWORD:D1C198F457D74F48808FE1724BECB291%\n- %PASSWORD:D1C198F%\nTypically when a connection is not selected/specified, the arg parser replaces args with empty strings. When a specified credential argument is provided, it will be replaced even if no connection is provided.. The psd files can be opened via GIMP too. I was able to download it. Are you able to access s3.amazonaws.com?. Yep! We do plan to add this at some point (pull requests welcome if you or someone you know can work on this).\nClosing as duplicate of #503 - subscribe to that issue for further updates on this enhancement request. I've reapplied the fix to v1.76 - it will be available in the next alpha build (alpha 3). @penguinairlines As of v1.76 the portable version saves user preferences in the same folder as mRemoteNG.exe. The installed version still saves to AppData\\Local\n(Thanks for pointing out the badges, I've updated them now). The installed (msi) version saves to AppData\\Local and should still be changed. somewhat related to #649 . We need more people that can help with issues / develop :(\n@pedro2555 You were the last one to take a good look at this issue, do you have the time to take a look again? Anything we need to implement in mRemoteNG?\n(Although it's fair to say that I'm behind on pull requests anyways).. Would be solved by #503 . Closing as duplicate - please follow #503 for updates. Tasks for myself to get this merged:\n- [ ] Update User settings file with new file path info for portable version >=1.76\n- [ ] Update Acceptance Testing with test cases for this change. Also, retargeted to develop branch for inclusion in v1.76. Resolved merge conflicts due to retargeting to develop. \n@pedro2555  I did a bit of quick testing and things look good. You might want to retest again yourself to make sure I didn't mess anything up. Testing still looks good - merging changes. Retargeted to develop branch. @pedro2555 Here is a patch file for proposed changes to solve the merge issues that happened because of the retarget. Let me know if this works for you. Once the merge conflicts are resolved we can start testing and get this merged in\npr706_patch.diff.txt\n. Merging this into a custom branch off of master, it will still be included in v1.76. This is now merged to the develop branch. I agree with making this a configurable option. Retargeted to develop branch. With the re-target, you will need to abandon the changes made to frmMain and instead add the call to UI\\Controls\\QuickConnectToolStrip.cs. A lot of ui stuff was moved out of frmMain in the develop branch. Closing as duplicate of #449 . Related to / duplicate of #492 . This sort of enhancement will be enabled by #255. While we do not yet have a way to save/load credentials from other sources, that enhancement will make it possible. Another related enhancement is #187 . Happening due to test CanDeleteLastFolderInTheTree(). It calls ConnectionTree.DeleteSelectedNode() which calls Runtime.SaveConnectionsAsync() directly.\nI don't think this is an issue in production, but we should definitely move the call to save connections somewhere else. My recommendation is to register save-actions on the ConnectionTreeModel rather than hard coding it in the ConnectionTree ui class. This was my initial intention when putting in the ObjectListView but just didn't take the time to implement it correctly.. Sort of -\nThe DefaultConnectionInfo object was being created before the SettingsLoader ran. The SettingsLoader is responsible for decrypting the ConDefaultPassword. Since these were out of order, the DefaultConnectionInfo was getting the encrypted string and then the SettingsLoader was decrypting the string saved in the Settings class. Since the DefaultConnectionInfo was already created by this point, it never received the decrypted string.. Sounds good to me - merging. Pushing this back to v1.77. Was finally able to test this today, looks good! Merging. Can you also provide the mRemoteNG.log file? Details here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. Exception seems to be happening in unmanaged code. From the first minidump:\n\nUnhandled exception at 0x7761E3BE (ntdll.dll) in mRemoteNG.exe.60916.dmp: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x047D2D6C.\n\n@kmscode Any ideas?. Set the Use Console Session to Yes on your RDP connection records. This is equivalent to providing /admin on the command line.. Thanks for linking those issues @dtandersen. Though the requests are only related, not duplicated. We should implement both as separate options (due to the request in #1171).\n\n\n281 requests coloring of connections in the connection tree window\n\nThis issue requests the connection tabs be colorable. The following page may help resolve this:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#classnotreg. I've done some testing and this seems to work. If you have time, could you all try out the revert_credmanager branch and do some poking around? Thanks!\n\n@kmscode @pedro2555 @Kvarkas @dekelMP @jotatsu . Fixed a few issues that I noticed related to saving/loading.. @GitCitizen Can you explain more? I don't see how @jfrcs3's 2nd request would help with that situation. He is just requesting that the currently selected connection is highlighted in the connection tree window.. Ah gotcha. Currently the existence of a connection tab/panel is very closely tied to the state of the connection. Once a connection disconnects, the tab/panel it was being shown within is immediately destroyed. We could maybe just display a \"Connection is closed\" message in that panel instead of immediately closing it. This could be a setting - auto-close like we do now or display a message. \n@GitCitizen Would you mind creating a new issue for this? While it's slightly related to this issue, it's different enough to warrant its own ticket. https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/new. Likely related to #763. Fix will be released with 1.75.7011. This can be done by going to File -> Import -> Import from file. According to https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/docs/viewer-parameter-ref.html only a Username parameter exists, and that is only supported until version 5.3.2. Please provide the version of mRemoteNG you are running. I don't recognize that screen shot. Can you tell me where you are seeing this?. The following setting must be enabled for that dialog to be shown Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Automatically try to reconnect when disconnected from server (RDP & ICA only). I looked into the previous functionality of the \"Automatically reconnection\" and \"Connect when ready\" checkbox, and it seems to have always acted this way.\nNormally when a connection is lost the panel that was hosting the connection is destroyed.\nWhen Automatically try to reconnect... is enabled and the connection is lost, then the panel that was showing the connection is not destroyed. Instead, the \"Connect when ready\" dialog is displayed. When the checkbox is checked, a new connection will be established as soon as possible.\nFrom what I understand, the requested enhancement is to allow you to always reconnect as soon as possible, without always needing to check the \"Connect when ready\" checkbox. Is that correct?\nAre there any times when you may want some servers to always reconnect immediately, but some servers you want to check the \"Connect when ready\" before reconnecting? Or is the \"Connect when ready\" checkbox sort of useless? Maybe we can default the checkbox to always checked?. That's a good point. The other thing we could do is have a sub-option on the Advanced options page like Automatically connect when server is ready.\nYou would enable Automatically try to reconnect... to enable the current functionality, and that would allow you to also set the sub-option Automatically connect when server is ready which would enable the dialog checkbox automatically for all connections.\nWe can do a per-connection option, but that might be overkill unless it's really useful to be able to do that. We would have to add a connection property to handle it.. This issue is happening at step 13. Since quick connect entries are not saved anywhere, there is no way to reopen the connection (we have no idea what the hostname was). We would need to change how the \"Reconnect to previously opened sessions on startup\" option is implemented to make this work. \nThis would be new functionality as no previous version ever supported reconnecting to quick connect entries.\nDev note:\nCurrently, we save a PleaseConnect flag on each connection in the connection tree that is open during a save. When mRemoteNG is started and the reconnect option is turned on, we go through the connection tree and connect to all connection records that have the PleaseConnect flag turned on. This is all handled in the PreviousSessionOpener class. This class is loaded into the connection tree to be run as a  post-setup action.\nWe will either need to save currently connected quick-connect entries in a special area or we need to keep track of reconnection targets in some other way (must be serialized).. This is weird - I don't know why it still thinks there is a merge conflict. Ok, should be good now. I don't know why it still thought there was a merge conflict. Yea there have always been some slightly weird window focus issues in the app. There are a few cases where we have to intercept windows display messages to make putty window focus work a bit more naturally. My guess is that there is an edge case there that we aren't accounting for and it's causing this behavior.\nFor reference, this is happening in frmMain.cs in method \nprotected override void WndProc(ref System.Windows.Forms.Message m). Taking a look. Found and resolved the issue - releasing the fix now since this is a pretty serious bug. You will need to delete your user.config file after installing the update. \nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/User-settings-file. Actually, you may not need to delete your user.config file. Try updating to 1.75.7010 first and see if that works.. I've found where the issue was and have fixed it. A fix will be released with 1.75.7011 in the next day or so. v1.75.7011 has been released.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011\nYou may need to delete your user.config file if you are still seeing decryption failures. Was able to find the cause. A fix will be released shortly.. I think I have a fix for this in place.\n@Alessio71  @peanek Would you be able to test the following version and confirm?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011.r1. Good to hear, sorry for the trouble it caused you. v1.75.7011 has been released\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011. @kmscode What do you think - make the button a variable size or just make it say \"Install\". Are you using SQL for connection storage? If you change the size of the connection tree window, does the tree reappear?. I was able to reproduce it once while resizing the window, but not when minimizing a folder. Does it happen very often for you?. If I provided a portable build, would you be able to test if it resolves the issue you're seeing?. @RJC84 that is definitely weird\n@farosch I'll try to get you a build within the next few hours. @farosch give this one a try: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011.r1. Good to hear!. v1.75.7011 has been released\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011. @proxymus v1.76.x has search filtering as a new feature. Relevant discussion:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mRemoteNG/comments/7a4nwi/port_scan/. Try using %!Password% (note the !) to disable shell character escaping. More details here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#special-character-escaping. Do you load from a custom connection file path?\nMake sure that the CustomConsPath contains a value in your user settings file (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/User-settings-file)\n<setting name=\"CustomConsPath\" serializeAs=\"String\">\n    <value>C:\\your\\path\\here\\confCons.xml</value>\n</setting>\nYou can also try deleting your user settings file, though you will lose other settings as well.. When you setup an external tool, is anything being written to %APPDATA%\\mRemoteNG\\extApps.xml?. Check the mRemoteNG.log file, where does it say it is loading the external tools from? Example log here:\n2017-11-02 11:13:43,950 [1] INFO - mRemoteNG 1.75.7010.21169 starting.\n2017-11-02 11:13:43,960 [1] INFO - Command Line: System.String[]\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,095 [1] INFO - Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise  64-bit\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,095 [1] INFO - Microsoft .NET CLR 4.0.30319.42000\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,096 [1] INFO - System Culture: en-US/English (United States)\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,096 [1] INFO - Checking FIPS Policy...\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,097 [1] INFO - Checking Lenovo AutoScroll Utility...\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,979 [1] INFO - Loading External Apps from: C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\mRemoteNG\\extApps.xml\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,980 [1] INFO - Adding External App: git-bash C:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-bash.exe --cd-to-home\n2017-11-02 11:13:45,980 [1] INFO - Adding External App: PowerShell ISE %windir%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\PowerShell_ISE.exe. That is very odd - it should be writing to one of the locations detailed here https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\nIf it's not logging to either location then something may have become corrupted. Good to hear @emanuelpsilva! Happy to help. I'd prefer to implement this as an interface to keep things easy to manage.\ncsharp\nIExternalAppIntegrator\n{\n    bool CanIntegrate(string path); // is this integrator valid for this file\n    void Integrate(Process externalAppProcess); // perform the act of integrating the app. not sure if Process is what we really want as an arg here though\n}\nEach app gets its own class to handle integration and the current code for integrating apps can just be moved to a DefaultExternalAppIntegrator implementation.. Forgot to add that to the list, thanks for reminding me. v1.75.7011 has been released. I'm fairly sure this should resolve the issue you are seeing, but please confirm\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011. I believe this is a duplicate of #763. A fix for this will be released in the next few days. You can also try https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011.r1 now if you want. Tested the cases you mentioned in v1.75.7011 and couldn't replicate, so this next version should resolve the issues you are seeing. v1.75.7011 has been released\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011. @janborup Thanks for reporting that, i've opened #814 for that bug. No worries about the Atlassian account - what you did here is perfect. Thanks for the PR Bruce - taking a look at Jenkins. It was a stale tool path in the jenkins build file. Since longer lived branches (develop) still had the old nuget packages cached, they were succeeding. New branches didn't have the versions of nunit that the build file wanted. Should be all good now, but I'm going to need to find a nicer way to keep the build file updated.. Do you remember the previous version of mRemoteNG you were using?. That helps, thanks @ilog2000. I'll look into it. @Annihilator is Tools -> Options -> Connections -> Save connections after every edit enabled?. Found the issue. Fix will be available in the next hotfix release 1.75.7011. v1.75.7011 has been released https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011. Duplicate of #763, should be fixed with the next release which is coming shortly. No problem! Better to have duplicates than no reports :). Can you please provide a copy of the mRemoteNG.log file?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. Closing due to lack of response. Check if Tools -> Options -> Connections -> \"Set hostname like display name when creating or renaming connections\" is enabled. If you did not enable this option explicitly, I can look into that as a bug (it should default to \"disabled\").. Give v1.75.7011 a try - that bug should be fixed in this version\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7011. @DBT76 Is it ok if we close out this issue?. Will be included in v1.76. Nice, looking forward to it @brucetp! We are hoping to be feature-complete for v1.76 by Nov. 24. If this PR is done by then we will likely include it in that release. @brucetp Cool - could you pull the latest develop branch updates and merge those into your feature branch? It should prompt you to resolve the merge conflict.. Looks good, thanks @brucetp! Merging. Thanks for the PR @farosch! However, I think that this was done on a very old version of the develop branch and some of these changes risk overwriting other changes.\nThere are 2 ways forward:\n1. Abandon the current changes, pull the most recent develop branch, and redo the changes\n2. Attempt to resolve the merge conflicts on the current files.\nI think the only changes on these files recently has been the theme manager changes (all UI controls should be the NG version -- NGLabel, NGTextBox, etc).. v1.75.7011 should resolve this bug for you. I was able to replicate the issue in v1.75.7010 and verified that it is fixed in v1.75.7011. Thanks for resubmitting @farosch . Use %!PASSWORD% (note the !) to disable shell meta-character escaping\nMore info here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#special-character-escaping. Duplicate of #419, but thank you for reminding me to get this changed. I'll update the documentation shortly. Script has been updated. All COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS have been removed. Looks good, thanks @farosch !. I've been mulling it over and I'm not sure about removing the other save options. However, I can't think of a specific reason that I feel uneasy about it. I'd be ok with making save-on-edit default to enabled (default is disabled at this point in the PR). It might even make sense to make it an either-or choice between save-on-edit and other options (save every X minutes). I think for now I'll keep everything else as-is. The only part that I'm still considering is making save on edit default to enabled. It's probably the right move going forward, but will this catch some users by surprise? I don't want it to cause issues if a user can't have it enabled.\nThe one example I can think of is for massive connections files. In my last job I had a connection file with 15k+ connections in it. Saving that file to local disk took ~3-4 sec. Creating and editing a bunch of connections would cause a lot of activity that could have been batched up all at once in intervals.\nCould maybe just put a disclaimer in the release notes that it is being defaulted to enabled?. I'm able to replicate. We will need to add support for parsing the extended ascii characters as they are saved in the registry. Example:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\Sessions\\%FC%F6%E4%DF. Thanks @DamianBis !. For item 2, is your Tabs & Panels -> \"Always show panel selection dialog when opening connections\" enabled? I wasn't able to replicate that one. The other potential cause for item 2 is that the default connection value for \"Panel\" is empty. Quick connections take most of their settings from the default connectioninfo. If a connection's \"Panel\" setting is empty, the app opens the choose panel form. If that isn't desirable, we can make it an option to either prompt or just use the General panel.. Not able to replicate items 3 and 4 in v1.76 alpha 2 either. @kmscode can you confirm? It might be something specific to your instance, so I'd like to be certain i'm not missing something.\nCome to think of it, item 1 might be related to my last post. It's likely your default connection \"Panel\" property is empty. @kmscode Could you go through these items again and validate them?. Yea, we may just need to set a default value for Panel in the default connection info if no value is found. Is it safe to do that? Is there ever a case where someone would not want a value in the Panel property at all?. Ah, I see. I'll look into fixing that today.. Ok, I think this is fixed on the v1.76 branch now. 2 changes:\n- Set the ConDefaultPanel setting to have a default of General (unfortunately cant use a localized string here)\n- Updated the methods that create quick connect and special web connections (Help menu items) to use the localized General form if the default connectioninfo doesn't have a value set.. I'm able to replicate the issue - I'll look into it. I think I've fixed it - this will be included in the 1.75.7012 release. Might be missing Citrix receiver? That's a common missing component. Here's the devenv setup doc if you need it:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Development-Environment. Np, thanks for the PR. Im able to replicate this. When a folder is directly under the root connections node, it should have inheritance completely disabled. I'll look into this.. It doesn't make much sense to allow items to inherit from the root connections node since no connection properties can be changed on that node.\nI also re-read a line in your original post on this thread:\n\nOn the root Connection I have enable Inherit All = yes\n\nAnd this should not even be possible. Since the root connection node has no parents, the inheritance button should not be available on it.. > If I remember correct in an older version (1.72?) it was necessary to enable Inherit All on the root Connections, otherwise inheritance was not automatically set on the hosts and needed to be enabled always manually. Which was quite annoying.\nAhh I think you are talking about default connection inheritance, which will set the inheritance for new items. This does not change already created connections/folders. The requirement of \"When a folder is directly under the root connections node, it should have inheritance completely disabled\" was also the behavior in v1.72.. Resolved the bug around inheritance not being disabled when a connection/container's parent is the root node. Commit b03d355. @LIyoai  I'm going to close this issue for now, but please reopen it if you think this issue is not resolved or if you have any other questions. That is the correct behavior. Setting an inheritance item on the Admin folder is saying \"the Admin folder should inherit this value from its parent (Connections)\". Since the Connections node is not meant to hold connection information, it doesn't make sense for its direct children to inherit values from it. Since the Admin folder does have configurable connection details, its children (Active Directory) are allowed to inherit from it.. That is definitely a bug, and one that the recent release (1.75.7012) was supposed to address. It may be that deserialization doesnt trigger inheritance to be disabled. \nA work around would be to put that folder into another folder, then move it back under the Connections node. That should trigger the logic that turns off inheritance. \nIll keep looking into this.. Kicking this issue forward to v1.76 since we are reaching the end of development for that version anyways. Ok, so it looks like deserialization is the culprit here. If the connections/containers are created within mRemoteNG or are moved under within the connection tree, the right thing happens. But, if connections are imported from csv/xml (or added to the confCons by hand and reloaded) with inheritance turned on, then the config window will hide the fields which have been inherited. I'll write up some tests and then figure out a fix.. Commit 5076f13 should resolve this issue. This will be available in the next v1.76 pre-release. Currently those values aren't saved. We can certainly look into adding this though. In v1.76 there will be the option to group external tools by first letter in the external tools window. Is something like that what you were thinking? Or grouping in another way?. Began the process of obtaining a cert with DigiCert. New code signing cert is installed. New builds will use this new cert.. This is likely a highdpi issue - i haven't noticed this on any other test machines. Related to #321 . Thanks for spotting that, @HengzhiShao.\n@DennisT1 Closing this issue as a duplicate. Please follow #317 for further updates on this request.. Resolved this issue. Fix will be available in the next patch. @harrysummer If your RDP connection is set to Fit to panel, ensure that Automatic Resize is set to No. These can be found in the Appearance section of the config panel. Unfortunately no. The reconnection is the auto resize feature. Currently, RDP has no way to resize to client area while a connection is active. The work around is to restart the connection with the updated client area dimensions.\nThe closest feature RDP has to a dynamic resize is SmartSize. However, SmartSize just stretches the client area provided by the server to fit the client area on your local host.. Duplicate of #196 \nFollow that issue for future updates. Are you seeing any errors? Could you provide your mremoteng.log file?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. You can ignore installer prerequisites by running the following in a cmd prompt:\nmsiexec /i C:\\Path\\To\\mRemoteNG-Installer.msi IGNOREPREREQUISITES=1\nMore info here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Installing. Glad you found an old install for 1.72. We do have past releases available here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases. It goes back as far as v1.72 I think.\nRegarding RDP:\nThe error message you got was due to not having the required KB installed. They can be immensely annoying to get installed correctly :(. More details here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#classnotreg\nRegarding VNC:\nWe are unlikely to support versions 4.0+ anytime soon :(\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#vnc-connections-fail-with-the-error-the-server-is-using-an-unsupported-version-of-the-rfb-protocol-the-server-is-using-version-41-but-only-version-3x-is-supported-. @TheMatrix2809 Unfortunately no, .NET Framework 4.6 is a hard requirement for the app to run. igd10iumd32.dll appears to be a Nvidia driver, which seems pretty odd. Are there any errors mentioned in the mRemoteNG.log file?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. Does the crash happen immediately after starting mRemoteNG or is it after performing some action in the app? Does it happen consistently?. Would you be able to provide the assembly version of either igd10iumd32.dll or your Nvidia graphics drivers?. I remember there being another time where crashes would happen when mRemoteNG was running and the machine came out of sleep/hibernate. But I think that was due to some keyboard hook code that was removed in v1.74.\n@kmscode you have any ideas?. What do you think about having an option to set how the LoadBalanceInfo is sent? Maybe a checkbox in Tools -> Options -> Advanced called \"Format LoadBalanceInfo for Azure\"? This way the normal functionality stays intact (in case it breaks other cases) but those who need this set for Azure connections can make it work.\nOver time we might be able to phase out the option if we can show that there isn't any downside to formatting the property this way.\nIf that works for you, I can accept this PR as is and will add the necessary setting. It can be included in v1.76 since we aren't too far into testing and this should be a low impact change.. Merged - thanks for the PR @sirLoaf!. Added option for enabling utf8 encoding of the rdp \"load balance info\" property in commit 8aeea4d\nStarting in v1.76 alpha 2, this can be enabled in Options -> Advanced -> Use UTF8 encoding for RDP \"Load Balance Info\" property\nWhile it might have made more sense to make this a per-connection property rather than app-wide, it is significantly less work to do it this way. With any luck, encoding it as UTF8 doesn't break any other systems that accept the load balance info property. That, or Azure starts accepting UTF16 encoded strings.... If I'm understanding your request correctly, most of this should be possible by using external tools. If the built-in browsers dont work for a particular web page, you can setup an external tool to launch the page in your own browser. Visio files can be opened via external app as well, if you set the UserField property on the connection to be the path (or part of the path) to the visio file and pass in the %USERFIELD% variable to the external tool.\nDoes that solve what you are wanting to do, or is there more to it that I didn't pick up on?\n\nThe External tools page: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#variables\nSome example external tool configurations: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Common-External-Tool-Configurations. Hehe good to hear, glad to help!. Build box now has an updated vs2017 and jenkinsfiles have been updated to use msbuild15. Is Inherit Disk Drives set to 'yes' on the connection?. Thanks for sharing your work, @PrestigeComputing! We will consider it as a feature to include in the app as well. Thanks for the PR @dekelMP, merging. I screwed up a merge which caused the Jenkins failure, it's been fixed now. And since the PR has been merged Jenkins deletes the build details. Nothing to worry about. To my knowledge, it has never been encrypted. Typically, when sensitive data (such as a password) is required, it is provided via a replacement parameter to the external app. So in the arguments text you might have /p:%PASSWORD%. Then, you can run that external app from a connection you define in your connection tree. This takes the password set in the connection (which is saved securely) and provides it to the external app.\n\nIf you have a use case where this does not work, or for some reason need the extApps file to be encrypted, then we can certainly look into adding that feature in a future version.. This was a pretty small change, so it will be included in v1.76. It will be available in the next alpha release of 1.76. Is this a RDCMan v2.7 file? If so, support for importing that version will be added in our v1.76 release that is currently in alpha. You certainly can, if you would like. The more testers we have, the better!. If you would like to bypass the install prerequisite check, you can run the msi from the command line like so:\nmsiexec /i C:\\Path\\To\\mRemoteNG-Installer.msi IGNOREPREREQUISITES=1\nMore details here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Installing. Looking good @jotatsu. Though I notice that with themes on, the checkbox check mark is a bit low. Is that related to this change or a separate issue?\n\n.

I've taken a look at the changes and have run through some tests.

Not seeing any exceptions from the options pages. I'm going to merge what we have so far in preparation for another v1.76 alpha release. Feel free to open another PR if there is more to add. Wasn't able to reproduce this one yet. Pushing to the next release program. Thanks for reporting @systemsNinja. Could you provide the mRemoteNG.log file?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. @tommybuck @systemsNinja Are you still seeing the same error with v1.76 alpha 2?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.76Alpha2. @tommybuck Is the following setting turned on for you? Tools -> Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Always show panel selection dialog when opening connections. Hmm interesting, that should control whether the popup is always shown. What version of mRemoteNG are you running?. Made a slight change in commit 946679f to ensure we dont try to close disposed tabs. I'm still curious as to why the panel selection dialog is popping up for you though.. Ahhh yea I'm able to replicate it now. Thanks for providing that. I should be able to track down the root cause now. @tommybuck Is your default connection info Panel property empty? That is what was making the panel selection always appear for me. This will likely also happen if you use the quick-connect toolbar. They both create a new connection info from the default connection info and then set a few extra properties.\nI'm not sure how best to resolve this. We could just always send the Help menu items to the app default panel 'General', but this may not always be desired. Another option would be to use the Panel defined in the default connection info if it is set, otherwise use 'General'.. @tommybuck I've committed a fix for the Help menu items as a part of #802. This should be available in the v1.76.5 release. Duplicate of #208 . Can you explain a bit more what you mean? When you set a connection to inherit a setting, it takes the setting value from its direct parent (whatever folder it is in).. I think the pics you provided were removed when the email was converted to a post on Github. If the parent folder isn't a subfolder (it's parent is the Connections node), then all the properties should indeed be available. If they aren't it's likely that the folder has inheritance turned on and is trying to inherit from the Connections root node (which is definitely a bug). Take a look at #807 if that seems to be what is going on.. Ok, good to hear. If its ok with you, I'm going to close this issue and link it to #807. You can subscribe to that issue for further updates. Yes this has been annouing me also. Thanks for writing up the bug. Ive been dreading fixing this since toolbar position issues can be a pain... Thanks @jotatsu! I should hopefully have some time in the next few days to review it. Thats a bug with windows forms toolbars (specifically how we load toolbar positions). Its a pain to fix, but ill try to get to it soon. It will be in the next alpha release. Ive been pretty busy lately, but im going to try to get some work done on mremote this week. We will have to implement this.\nDev note for later:\nHere is the best info out there on how to enable this: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/93cb63d8-b4ff-40dd-8d11-66867db6258f/rdp-activex-and-restrictedadminmode?forum=winforms. Moving my notes from a duplicate issue:\nDev notes:\nTo do this we will need to:\n- [ ] Add a putty session provider to support loading kitty sessions from files\n- [ ] Add stuff in the options page to allow defining the kitty path. We will need to decide whether kitty can be used side by side with putty or if it is an either-or choice.\n--- If kitty and putty can be used together, we need to add a connectioninfo property to define which ssh provider to use. (We will need this anyway if we ever get around to supporting SSH.net #181)\n-- If kitty will be used instead of putty, we need a way to detect that it is kitty so we can use the right session provider. Either determine this dynamically (give us a path, we will decide which provider to use), or explicitly (some toggle checkbox or drop down to declare which provider to use).\n- [ ] Ensure that the connection tree node for putty connections displays \"PuTTY Sessions\" for normal putty and \"KiTTY Sessions\" for kitty to provide easy feedback to the user which provider is being used. Merged two similar requests for allowing file-based PuTTY configuration. Since KiTTY is well-known, we will focus on integrating that.. I've added some additional safety around the code that if failing for you. This should hopefully be resolved (or at least easier to diagnose) in v1.76. I haven't been able to replicate the issue myself, but I'm also not opening as many RDP sessions as I used to.\nWhat we know:\n1. This only seems to occur on Windows 10, starting with release 1709. There is one report of it occurring in version 1803 (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/930#issuecomment-419241169) Has anyone seen this occur on a version prior to 1709?\n1. So far there are 2 known ways the crash can occur:\n   1. Opening a new RDP connection\n   2. During a connection resize (going from full screen mode to non-full screen). https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/930#issuecomment-384276075\n1. The exception is occurring in Windows.UI.XamlHost.dll which is a low level Windows api for displaying windows and doing layout. The exception code is always 0xc0000409. There are a few google results for \"Windows.UI.Xaml 0xc0000409\" but then tend to point to Windows profile or file corruption.\nOpen questions:\n- Can this crash be reproduced on an older version of mRemoteNG (such as the latest v1.75)? This is the last big issue holding up v1.76 from being released under the Stable channel. However, if the bug occurs based on OS version rather than mRNG version, I'm ok with releasing. I just don't want to expose a known crash bug to Stable channel users.\n- What version of windows are the target hosts in most cases? Server 2016? 2012? A mix?\n- What is the RAM usage of mRemoteNG at the time of the crash? RDP has been known to use a lot of memory in certain cases.\n- Has anyone been able to replicate this with a single RDP connection, or is it always with multiple connections (at least 4+, 5+, etc)?. @janis-veinbergs Thanks for taking the time to test all of that! This helps quite a bit in narrowing things down. Since it seems this wasn't introduced in v1.76 we can proceed with that release.\nUnfortunately, we still have the problem of how to prevent these crashes. I went through the RDP code and I think every call has a try/catch block, so we should be capturing these exceptions. It might be time to add exception capturing logic at the root of mRemoteNG to gracefully catch any previously uncaught exception. It doesn't look good when the app completely dies.. Created a ticket to add root-level exception catching to try to prevent this from crashing the app. #1123. Yea, it doesn't seem likely that we will be able to catch it.\nWe call the native RDP client here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/d1a7a3790930e9658b7fed30b34c8345c8547c24/mRemoteV1/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs#L187. Great work @janis-veinbergs, thanks for putting that together.. Generally, the maximum number of connections you can open is capped at the amount of memory your system has to run mRemoteNG. This is usually only associated with RDP connections. You can try to reduce the memory consumption of individual connections by turning off Cache Bitmaps, which is the single largest contributor to connection memory use. Turning down the color to a lower bit-value may help as well.. \n. Duplicate of #666. Please follow that issue for updates. I'm wary of coding in exact character encodings like this, but I don't have a better idea. This fixes a known issue and that's good enough for me. Does the mRemoteNG.log show anything when this reconnect happens? What version of mRemoteNG are you running?. The fix for these issues should be present in the v1.76 alpha 2 release. Sorry for the late reply - if anyone is still experiencing the issue, can you please provide the mRemoteNG version, portable/installed, and Win10 version with build number. Providing a copy of the mRemoteNG.log file would help too (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging). There might be something in the Windows event viewer logs too, but that's hit or miss.\nI tried replicating the issue with mRemoteNG portable 1.75.7008 and 1.75.7012 on Win10 Version 10.0.16299 Build 16299 and wasn't able to get it to crash.. There is sort-of a way around this by setting the default value you want on the default connectioninfo screen of the connection tree (click Connections node, click the third-from-left button at the top of the connections tree, set the values you want). Though this process and its relationship to the quick connect feature is, at best, cryptic. I think #239 may help with this issue.\nDo you think that would solve the issue you are seeing, or is there some other workflow that would be more helpful?. @mmetully We already enable large address aware (LAA) on our exe before publishing it. We have looked into providing an x64 build of mRemoteNG as well, but that would prevent us from providing Citrix support (I have only been able to find a 32-bit version of their client library).. This might be mitigated by a v1.77 change that I've been spiking that will allow you to select the version of the RDP client to use during connection (#826). Currently, we only support client version 8. Though I think the most recent is v10. This version bump might contain memory usage improvements or other bug fixes.\n[...] or maybe try to spawn the child processes in separate memory?\nWe could look into that as well. Thanks for the bug report, we will look into this\nEdited title to be more descriptive. related to #196 . Does v1.76 alpha 2 solve this issue for you?. Closing due to lack of response. Very similar to #843 anyways - you can follow that issue for further updates. I dont think it is configurable at the moment. It will save backups to the same location as the currently loaded connections file. Good idea. We will need to think about how this would work in the ui, but actual implementation shouldn't be too bad. Duplicate of #574. Please follow that issue for any updates. I will need to think about this a bit. This is sort of how it is implemented already, but there are features that would need to be re-thought-through if connections can directly contain other connections.. Do you have Use CredSSP enabled for that connection (Protocol section in the config window)?. I would recommend attempting a connection from mRemoteNG with CredSSP turned on. According to the CredSSP protocol specification, the client and sever do not need to be on the same domain for the protocol to work. All it does is provide a TLS connection during authentication and help with selecting an authentication protocol that both hosts support.\nI admit it seems odd that this issue cropped up after updating mremoteng though.. Glad to hear that worked for both of you. I learned something as well - had to do a bit of digging to figure out what credssp was really doing for us.\nI've created issue #885 to look into improving the error message for rdp error 2825.. The only AxMstsc property we set based on the Use CredSsp value is _rdpClient.AdvancedSettings7.EnableCredSspSupport (RdpProtocol.cs:151). Related documentation page here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg130858(v=vs.85).aspx\nThe only somewhat related value seems to be _rdpClient.AdvancedSettings5.AuthenticationLevel (RdpProtocol.cs:143) which we currently hardcode to 0. Related documentation here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380846(v=vs.85).aspx. Though this seems to be more about authenticating that the server is valid via certs than requesting creds from a client.\nI cant find any property that specifically references NLA.\nIt may be that the AxMstsc library lacks the distinction between CredSSP and NLA.. Np @JRVcr, there may be work-arounds for it or something I'm still missing, so I'll keep this open for a bit. I am doing a bit of work on our RDP components next release so I may take a look at this again. Thanks for clarifying @guidez. We can get this added as a configurable option with a default of '0' as you've suggested. I'll tentatively add this to the v1.77 release. That release is getting a bit full, but this change is fairly straight forward.. @guidez You make a good point about the default value. Retaining the '0' default value provides an easy transition for users who are not affected by this issue. We don't want to 'break' existing functionality unless we have a good reason.\nFor users who will always want NLA, they can set the default connection info property to '2'. Newly created connections will have NLA turned on.\nThe largest issue will come for users who need NLA turned on for many connections. Because we do not yet support mass editing of connections, users will have to do a find & replace of the XML file or edit each individual connection in the app. Though this would be an issue with whichever default value we chose.\nAnother downside is that users who do still need NLA will receive that somewhat unhelpful error message. We can mitigate this drawback by improving the error message. Best practice is to (1) inform the user what went wrong and (2) include several suggestions for how to fix it or how to troubleshoot further. Currently this error message (and most of our error messages actually..) lacks that 2nd part.. Dev notes:\nTo do this we will need to:\n- [ ] Add a putty session provider to support loading kitty sessions from files\n- [ ] Add stuff in the options page to allow defining the kitty path. We will need to decide whether kitty can be used side by side with putty or if it is an either-or choice.\n--- If kitty and putty can be used together, we need to add a connectioninfo property to define which ssh provider to use.

I'll close this request as duplicate in favor of #851 so we have everything in one place.. Related to #196. . This is due to the option Automatic Resize. Set this to No for all connections where you do not want to reconnect when the panel size changes. Duplicate of #611. This feature is available in the current v1.76 alpha release.. I don't think we have an option to turn it on/off. Sometimes rdpclip.exe on the remote server has issues and needs to be restarted, so that would be something to check.. Closing as duplicate of #416, but is also implemented in PR #951\nFollow both of those for updates. I believe this is resolved in v1.76.\nA new option Save connections after every edit was introduced which makes that functionality configurable. Typically, you would not need both \"save after edit\" and \"save on exit\" enabled at once.\nConnecting/disconnecting now also counts as an edit, triggering a save. This produced the correct behavior when Reconnect to previously opened sessions on startup is enabled.. Yea should be fairly easy to do. I'll schedule for v1.77. @iaing80 No, not yet. v1.76 has been delayed due to lack of development resources, though we are making a hard push to get it to a stable release very soon. I hope to be able to start doing v1.77 development work once v1.76 reaches beta.. @casao94 We haven't gotten to it yet, though it is still scheduled for that version. This is somewhat covered by the current default connectioninfo system that we have, but I like the idea making these more of a template system. This would solve some of the issues around the current system and provide more flexibility without necessarily more complexity.\nRelated to #238 and #239 . Very interesting, thanks for sharing this @JRVcr. This does look like a nice area where mRNG can step in and provide a fix. It doesn't sound like it will be too hard to implement, we will just need to handle the special cases (REALLY Detect turned on but no RDG info supplied, that sort of stuff).. This is partly due to bug #1020. We were not correctly honoring the BackupFileKeepCount setting (default is 10). That should be fixed in the next v1.76 release.\nThe request for configuring backup options is a duplicate of #474. Please follow that issue for further updates.. Does turning on the following option adequately solve what you would like to do?\nTools -> Options -> Connections -> Set hostname like display name when creating or renaming connections. This will be fairly easy for mouse movement/clicks. We can create a transparent panel over the connection and intercept all mouse events. Might be a bit more involved with keyboard input though. It might be enough to unfocus the connection and not provide a way to focus it again for keyboard purposes.\nThe nice part about this approach is that it is protocol-independent. We only have to implement it once.. Turns out that doing this for RDP connections is very easy. Simply setting the AxHost control's Enabled property to false puts it into a view only mode. This won't be a connection info property so the implementation is very light. I'm going to add this to v1.77. The xsd was a little out of date. I've done a bit of work to bring it in line with the current connection models we are using. An updated version is available here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/develop/mRemoteV1/Schemas/mremoteng_confcons_v2_6.xsd\nWe currently do not use the v2.7 or v2.8 schemas - those were created for the credential manager feature which was delayed. v2.6 is the xml schema in use for mRemoteNG v1.75 (and v1.76, currently in alpha)\nLet me know if that XSD works for you.. Schema is updated with the Export field. I had originally removed that field since v1.76 does not require it, but that is not safe for v1.75 which still checks for that field.. Not a problem. I haven't been very disciplined in versioning the xml files which will get me into trouble at some point. I'm glad you brought all of this up so I can get some more testing in place before the v1.76 general release.. Thanks for reporting this. I fixed the bug and it will be available in the next v1.76 pre-release. Recent dev work was just completed to make this possible under #625\nThe most recent v1.76 alpha release has the new feature. A v1.76 stable release will be coming in the next few weeks. Sure thing, I'll re-enable that in the next v1.76 pre-release.. The ability to move the menu bar is now tied to the View -> \"Lock toolbar positions\" menu item. This will be available in the next v1.76 release. @runguyenhuu You can follow issue #666 for that enhancement request. Glad to hear this is resolved for you, thanks for reporting the issue @malfuncion!. Duplicate of #899, though I didn't have time to get a fixed build out until now. This is resolved in v1.76 Alpha 4.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.76Alpha4. Probably wouldn't hurt to add an option to disable the trimming. Not sure when I will be able to get to it though. I'll see what I can do. I don't want to delay v1.76 at all since it is already several months later than I was hoping for.. Taking this out of the 1.76 release since I haven't had enough time to work on the project. I'm not sure when this enhancement will be implemented. @LIyoai Is this still an issue you are noticing? Was this just when initially upgrading from v1.75 to v1.76?. If you are using the portable edition, are you also copying the mRemoteNG.settings file to the new version? This is the file where default connection/inheritance information is saved.. @LIyoai I am fairly sure that the default-inheritance behavior you are seeing is due to the default settings being saved in the mRemoteNG.settings rather than in the connections XML file. When migrating to a new portable version, also copy the mRemoteNG.settings from the old portable folder to the new one.. The credential repository feature (#208) will allow you to do this once implemented. Please follow that issue for further updates. It may be a bit before we can support this. We need to build the project for x64 so we can use more memory.. Could you provide exact steps to replicate the issue? I'm not seeing the issue. Thanks for the info @johnwc, that will help a lot in diagnosing the issue.\nAs for the csv de/serialization code, it is home-grown. The legacy csv serialization was generated as a huge string, so I just did the deserialization code the same way. I wouldn't be opposed to switching to a library though.. I think I've fixed the underlying problem in the serialization now. The fix will be available in the next v1.76 pre-release\nI played around with CsvHelper a bit, but switching over at this stage would be a bit more work than I'm willing to put in. Once v1.76 is out, maybe we can revisit it. I'm all for using a library to do this, but csv de/serialization isn't a feature I want to spend a lot of extra time on.. Fork + PR :)\nWe typically give repo-write access to folks that have been with the project for a bit. If you go through a few PRs and want to join the project we can certainly get that process going.. Closing this issue since the originally reported bug is resolved.. Seems related to #220. This may be an issue between the version of the mstsc RDP library that we use and Windows Server 2016. I am doing some work in v1.77 to improve RDP compatibility (#826) that might help with this.. I'm sorry this has happened to you, @ibrahim052. Here are several pages that may be able to help. First, try to recover the last good backup of your connections file. Also, take a look at the log file to see what may be causing the application to stop working. You can also try deleting the user settings file. We have seen it cause startup problems if it is corrupted.\n\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Backups-and-Recovery\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/User-settings-file. (If you've included an image, I am not able to see it. Images in emails do not get transferred to GitHub)\n\nYou may need to go back to an older backup. Checking the file size of the backups may help determine the last good backup (look for the largest file).. Glad to hear that you got it working! :). Thanks for adding this @benwa! \nMy comments didn't save from a few days ago.. i could have sworn they posted... :(\nI don't remember all my comments so they must not have been all that important. Here's the one I do remember though:\nWhat do you think about adding a quick description under each field? I saw it on an issue for either mstest or vstest recently though now I can't find it. It was a nice bit of extra prompting\nLike:\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue. Please be as detailed as possible.\n1.\n1.\n. Ahh, I was looking at it in the rich-text view and missed all of that completely. I like it. The template on that site has a description field at the top. What are your thoughts on adding it to our issues template?\n\n```\nDescription\n- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself, and why you consider it to be a bug \n```. I'm not sure what we can do to help here - this sounds like more of a system issue.. We are investigating x64 builds, but that will probably be a little ways off. I thought we had an issue logged for it, but I couldn't find it. Created one now for tracking: #915. Sounds good - is #155 something that could be done in v1.77? That release is getting pretty full already, but having 2 windowing frameworks is annoying.. I'd like to at least get a survey of how many users are using ICA. If it's large enough, maybe we can find some sort of work around. Maybe keep the x86 build as well and offer ICA as a plugin. I'd hate to cut off a bunch of users that may consider lack of ICA support a deal breaker.. Found the issue and improved the testing around this area. I still want to add some more tests, but this should be resolved in the next alpha release. Note to self: finish tests for default connection inheritance saving/loading. Tests are finished and merged to develop. I will be releasing a new v1.76 pre-release this weekend that includes this fix. I just wrote up an FAQ section for this. Let me know if this answers your question:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#rdp-tries-to-reconnect-whenever-i-resize-the-window-. Can you provide more context around this request? Do you want to disable multi ssh for all connections or just certain ones?. That makes sense. You might be connected to 6 servers but only want to send commands to 4 of them. Currently, you would need to log off of the two servers which you didn't want to send commands to. Ideally, you would just briefly exclude those 2 from receiving the multi-ssh commands. We can look into adding this.. Yea that makes sense. We can design the solution to allow that use-case. Duplicate of #187 . This is now resolved. If we detect a menu click on a folder, we will just ignore it and open the next sub-menu. The fix will be available in the next v1.76 release. Thanks for the PR @areytsman, I like the changes you've proposed! Since this feature is a little more involved, I will likely merge this into a different branch that will be used for v1.77. I want to get v1.76 stabilized and released as soon as possible.\nI would like to make the suggestion of changing the \"Disconnect Other Tabs\" menu item to \"Disconnect All But This\". I think it is more clear about which tabs will be disconnected. Resolved merge conflict and merged. Thanks for the PR @areytsman!. Will do - should be a pretty easy and useful enhancement. Scheduling for v1.77. Dev notes\nLooks like ConnectionInitiator.Prot_Event_Disconnected() is the method to update for this particular RDP error. However, it looks like there are 2 or 3 places where RDP errors can be caught/handled. It might be worth taking the time to refactor and simplify things.. @kmscode I think we can consider this implemented now. @tarund which version of Windows are you running?. I'm going to close this as a duplicate of #853 so we can have a single place for troubleshooting this crash. Please follow that issue for updates. Currently, the quick connect uses the default connection info to populate things like username/connection details. One option is to allow for overriding the behavior of the quick connect feature.\nRelated to #239 . Makes sense - I like it. It would be nice to be able to do more with mRemoteNG from the command line.\nDev notes: \nThis might take a bit to implement since we also need to consider the security impact. App must be fully started, connections file unlocked, then start pending connections. Might be similar to how connections from the previous session reconnect, though we will be reading from the cmd line rather than reading from the connections file. Might be a good idea to elevate the reconnection logic into its own service which can queue up connections to be run at a later time. This would also allow us to save \"reconnection groups\" and potentially share these connection groups between users.. You can do this by putting your RDG settings in the default connection properties.\nRelated to #239 and #975. Thanks for the PR @marcomsousa! Since this is very low risk, it will be available in the next v1.76 pre-release. Thanks for the PR @sli-pro! Since this is a low risk change, it will be available in the next v1.76 release. Looks good @sli-pro! I like the layout changes you are proposing. This seems like a fairly low-risk change, so it will be available in the next v1.76 pre-release.. Hi @sandyyz, this is due to mRemoteNG not having support for High DPI environments. You can follow #321 for further updates. Github didn't add a reference to the issue since it was in the title. Adding it here so they are linked #940. Thanks for the PR @sli-pro! They will be included in the next v1.76 release. Makes sense. We should be able to get this in pretty easily. Even though this is only a 2 line change, I'm going to schedule this for v1.77. This will need some testing to ensure it does not have a negative impact on other related actions.. I've created #1089 to talk about the connection filter enhancement more. I think we will need a more involved solution to get it working like users would expect.. Yes, we have been thinking about how to add mass-edit features for a while. Unfortunately there are a lot of other features ahead of it in the queue.. @seleky Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on this. This error is due to a missing Windows update on your local machine. See here for more details: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/FAQ#classnotreg. I'm open to having the help files just on our wiki to help maintainability.\nThere isn't much use in getting rid of the change log file though, since we update that as we work through a release and copy it into the Github release once we publish.. Since this is just translation work, it will be included in v1.76. Changed target to fix some merge conflicts caused by another PR. Thanks for the translation work @farosch!. Thanks for the PR @CrAbelleira! It looks like the test failure is due to the CSV file not having a heading for InheritRedirectClipboard. Adding that in the csv serializer WriteCsvHeader() method should resolve the issue. @kmscode I don't think we should. Though the change is small on the functionality side of things, it does introduce some risk on the serialization/deserialization side. I think we are close enough to getting v1.76 stable that we can start getting early v1.77 development builds out fairly soon.. @CrAbelleira Sorry for the delay in getting back to you about this. It looks like the Xml serializer/deserializer do not have entries for the RedirectClipboard setting. Could you add those in?. Hey @CrAbelleira sorry for the delay.\nMuch of the serialization code needs to be redone since it is getting difficult to manage breaking changes. You can update the following files to finish your implementation:\n- XmlConnectionNodeSerializer26\n   - Update the SetElementAttributes() and SetInheritanceAttributes() methods\n- XmlConnectionsDeserializer\n   - Add a new version check at the bottom for your property: if (_confVersion >= 2.7)\n- CsvConnectionsDeserializerMremotengFormat\n   - Update ParseConnectionInfo()\n- CsvConnectionsSerializerMremotengFormat\n   - Update WriteCsvHeader() and SerializeConnectionInfo()\nOptional, but encouraged:\n- RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializer\n   - Find how RDCMan saves clipboard redirection and update the ConnectionInfoFromXml() method\n- RemoteDesktopConnectionDeserializer\n   - Same as above, update method SetConnectionInfoParameter()\nSQL server updates\nIf you are comfortable doing SQL server work, we will also need to add this property to the database de/serializer and create a schema upgrader. However, if you aren't comfortable with doing that then I'm happy to handle it instead.\n- Add a SqlVersion26To27Upgrader class in mRemoteV1\\Config\\Serializers\\Versioning. Model it after the other upgraders and provide the correct ALTER TABLE sql command to add the property column\n- Update DataTableSerializer.CreateSchema() and DataTableSerializer.SerializeConnectionInfo()\n- Update DataTableDeserializer.PopulateConnectionInfoFromDatarow(). Thanks @CrAbelleira, I think it looks good. The failing test is for the XML schema change like you said. I'll fix that once the code is merged.\nThanks for your work!. An option was added in 1.76 alpha 6 (defe9e0) to allow you to toggle this. Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Create an empty panel when mRemoteNG starts\nThis also allows you to name the panel. There is currently no 'temp lock' like you've mentioned, though you can encrypt the connections file with a custom password. Click the Connections tree node -> Set Password protect to Yes -> Enter your desired password.  When mRemoteNG starts, you will need to provide that password to open the connections file.. You can follow #376 to get updates about making the custom password a mandatory feature.. Does your mRemoteNG.log file have any useful errors? https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. Closing as duplicate of #449 . I've committed a fix for this in 9659ac1. We will now prompt for what to do when decryption fails, similar to how we prompt when a connection file cant be found. This should no longer cause the confCons file to be overwritten.\nThis will be available in the next v1.76 release. An option was added in 1.76 alpha 6 (defe9e0) to allow you to do this. Options -> Tabs & Panels -> Create an empty panel when mRemoteNG starts\nThis also allows you to name the panel. Which protocol(s) would you like to see this in? It is likely impossible to do with RDP. I would have to look into whether this is possible with PuTTY as an SSH provider. It would definitely be possible if we moved to something like SSH.Net (#181) since we would have full control over the terminal window.. I get around that by selecting the connection and doing a Reconnect. Though I see your point about the change password dialog. I'm not entirely sure the RDP protocol allows us to do what you are suggesting, but we can look into it.. If I'm understanding correctly, you are having issues with saving/loading user.config because your environment uses roaming profiles. Is that correct?\nIf so, this is related to #690 / #414.. I think #1238 is a duplicate of this issue, but I couldn't find this one initially. I've fixed part of this in #1238 and the other part will be fixed shortly. This should be available in v1.77.0. Resolved in #625 - this is available in the current v1.76 alpha release.. In addition to @Philippwolf's suggestion, check the mRemoteNG.log file as well.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. Glad it's working for you again!. Good idea. Almost done with File menu testing, just need to test the export feature a bit more.. @PetbkA Great stuff here! I should have a little time tonight to start going through these notes. Thanks for helping with testing!. >  Hotkeys for new folder and new connection stop working if File menu was called when PuTTy Saved Sessions was selected\nResolved under #999\n\nAlso it's possible to create new element inside PuTTy Saved Sessions - you have to create new folder in root element, then delete it - PuTTy node will be active (but, I guess, not focused), and it'll be possible to create new node inside it through hotkey.\n\nResolved under #998\n. @PetbkA I edited both your posts to add checkboxes to the issues you have raised. This will help me track which ones I've handled. Thanks again for your thorough testing, it is an immense help to getting 1.76 released.. > What is considered the correct version? On the website I see Prerelease v1.76 Alpha 6, which doesn't equal to 1.76.4.16229. I suggest to use version from OS Uninstall or change a program window;\nThat is a fair point. I've been thinking about changing how we display the release versions on the website that is more indicative of the actual version number and also supports our update channels. (For example, 1.76.4.16229 could have been promoted to the beta update channel, which makes \"v1.76 alpha 6\" a very confusing label.) For this verification, it is probably enough to check that the About page version matches the version number shown when right clicking the app icon -> Properties -> Details -> Product version.\nI think the value shown in the OS uninstall window can differ from the actual program version, depending on how the MSI was set up. Though this would probably be good to verify as well.\n\nP.S.: I started to mark lists as checklists. Tell me if I shouldn't do so\n\nPerfect! It will help me to not forgot things. > 2-5 (Websites). It's better to open links in default browser instead of mRNG tab that uses IE. Moreover, Report a Bug opens GitHub that says that browser is no longer supported;\nThis one will probably need to be moved out to v1.77 since it would be a larger change. There are a lot of unintuitive things that happen when connections are created (even going to a website). If you changed the browser engine set in the default connection info (must select Http/s protocol first) to Firefox, then the github message should go away.\nBut like you said, opening those sites in the default browser is probably the better way to go though.. > Hotkeys stop working and disappear from the menu if I'll do the folowing steps:\n\n\nRight click on the node to call context menu;\nLeft click on the same node to close menu.\n\nGIF that shows it. After this steps hotkeys stop working immediately. Bug doesn't reproduce if the left click will be on the other node or the right click will be done on the same node\n\nResolved under #1001.. @PetbkA I went through some your port scan testing results.\n\nCan't move through octets of IPs by arrows or Tab;\n\nNoted - we will probably want to put in an enhancement request for this. It shouldn't been hard to add, but I'm not sure it's really a bug. Moving forward through octets can be done by using period (.), though there isn't a good way to move between start range/end range controls. Even the period key to move through octets doesn't seem like that great of a decision in hindsight. I'm not sure that all cultures use a period for octet separation. For example, German uses a comma for decimal number separation (1,25), do they use commas for octet separation too?\nAlso fixed the tab ordering between elements on this page to make it easier to fill out.\n\nStop button does nothing - Scan goes until completion;\n\nLooks like the scan itself is done within 1-2 seconds for 255 hosts. The delay seen in the UI is due to huge inefficiencies in how the results are updated. The main issue seems to be that we try to update the UI for each individual ip result. The UI can't keep up and the update events queue up, leading to UI lock and unintuitive behavior of the \"stop\" scan button. By the time the UI is responsive, the scan has likely finished. We will want to rework this screen quite a bit to fix that.\n\nCan't sort results;\n\nEnhancement request: #841\n\nWhy Protocol to import is needed? If I'll choose RDP, it still imports only the selected node from the list, not all where RDP is available;\n\nThis controls the protocol assigned to the port scan results that are imported. Selecting \"RDP\" will import all selected scan results as connections with a protocol set to RDP. It does not control which results are imported. We may need to update the label text to be more clear about this - maybe \"Protocol for imported connections:\".. > Strange logic. If I select 10 connections with SSH protocol on half of them, what's the point of importing them as RDP connections? IMHO importing only the connections that contain selected protocol is better\nI think the reasoning was that while some ports may be well-known (3389, 22, 23, etc), a user may need to connect to a custom port (9260) for a protocol. But really I'm just guessing. @Vershner That appears to be trying to import, but having issues due to a bug. There is likely some field that we expected to find in the RDCman file that wasn't there. I've added some additional safety checks in the importer that should help. The next release will include the fix. > 2.iii. Caught an exception, presumably when I've choose connection from history and changed its type. I couldn't reproduce it.\nSeems to be a weird case where the deletion target is null. I think c74f37f should fix this.. > 2.i. If something is entered in address field, changing protocol already opens connection. I guess that connection should start only when I press the button with protocol name;\nThis is working as originally designed, though I can see how this could be confusing. If it is problematic enough, we can open an issue to discuss it further.. > If I choose single node and do the import through Import button at the lower right corner, Port Scan tab is closed. Reopening it crashes the app;\n\nIf I try to import several nodes through Import button at the lower right corner, I get unhandled exception immediately,\n\nResolved via #1030. > If only one panel is opened, it can't be closed through x button. GIF that shows it.\nThat X button is actually to close a connection within the panel, not to close the panel itself. Since you don't have the \"Always show panel tabs\" option enabled and there is only one panel, you do not see the X button to close the panel. This should be less confusing when we remove one of the two windowing libraries that we are using (#155). Also slightly related to the conversation in #368.. > Switching language still leaves some interface elements from home locale. In my case Russian text is present in context menus when English locale is enabled\nI was able to find a fix for this. We were setting the language of the connection context menu before loading the culture/language that should be used. Resolved under #1034. > When app is started with russian locale, opening Options switches menu toolbar (but none of it's sections contents) to English;\nThis one has me stumped. I can replicate the issue, but I can't seem to find how this is happening or why. The menu text changes during a system level WndProc() call, but I'm not seeing any C# code that could be causing it. This one may take a bit to track down. Created #1037 to track this bug\n\nIf Options window is closed on Connections tab, opening Options again causes unhandled exception\nResolved under #1036\n. Standard regression testing is done for v1.76. Thanks for reporting @farosch. I'll take a look at this right away. This is now fixed and will be in the next v1.76 release. Added tests to catch issues like this in the future as well.. Closing as duplicate of #222. Please follow that issue for further updates. Good find. I'll look into this one. There was some special logic we had to add to get the column width updating properly to avoid the connection name truncation (...). It's likely this was an edge case that got missed. Thanks @PetbkA, I can get that one fixed pretty easily.\n\n@farosch Had you used the \"Expand all folders\" button at any point when you noticed this bug?. I've fixed the issue with the Expand All button. I'm able to reproduce the issue your issue now as well, @farosch. Those steps were very helpful. I should be able to get a fix for that shortly.. @farosch I've committed a fix for your issue. I will be available in the next v1.76 build. This is due to the Shell Metacharacter Escaping feature. Use %!HOSTNAME% (note the '!' at the beginning of the parameter) to disable escaping these characters.\nMore information:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#shell-metacharacter-escaping. This feature request will be influence by #155. This was implemented under #338 and is available from v1.76 alpha 1 and onward. Does that handle your use-case?. Maybe the main feature that is missing in our currently implementation is that you must activate filtering from Options -> Connections -> Filter search matches in connection tree. A small icon in the search box or a drop-down option would be useful if you intend on switch between normal search and filtering somewhat often.. Resolved. This will be included in the next v1.76 release. This is now resolved. The fix will be available in the next v1.76 release. This is resolved. The fix will be included in the next v1.76 release. This is resolved. The fix will be available in the next v1.76 release. Related to #196 in the fact that we need to create a hotkey manager to set, save, load, and detect hotkeys.. This is resolved. It should be available in the next v1.76 release. Regarding filtering, this is a known limitation that was accepted during implementation (#338). While it is possible to work around this limitation, it would require re-implementing the entire filtering feature. We are currently just using the built-in filtering provided by ObjectListView.. Good point @farosch, I've been so focused on bug fixes I forgot about the open PRs :). I'm not able to easily reproduce this bug. What is the smallest reproducible connection tree sample that produces the loop? Or, where in the code do you believe it is looping?. I've analyzed the calls being made and the program is spending most of its time generating cryptographic values used during encryption. This happens for each value that must be encrypted (each password field in the confCons file).\nIn addition, the autosave feature doesn't have a batching or limiting function at the moment. Every update to the tree triggers an autosave. Sorting the whole tree could cause hundreds of tree updates. Not good :(\nThe fix for this is to either batch the saves and do them all at the end or at least limit the frequency of saves that can occur. Batching would be the better option, though I'm on the fence about how exactly to implement it.. I have a fix that I'm happy enough with for this release. Merged in commit 8029e49. This will be available in the next release.\n2 main changes:\n- Once a sort operation is started, saves are batched. A single save (if any) is run at the end of the sort.\n- The save is now done on a background thread. This was previously using the UI thread for some reason.\nThis brings the sort operation down to ~5sec on my machine. The save still takes about 15sec, but you can use the app while that happens.. Can you explain what you mean by \"the floating\" config box?\nIf i normally have the config box docked to the left side of the screen, but it is currently hidden, would clicking the Properties menu item simply show the config panel (docked on the left) or would it show in some separate window or fly-out control?. Would it also work if we didn't close the tab that the connection was being shown in? That way the Reconnect and Reconnect All functionality could be used for reestablishing those lost connections.\nThis is already how the putty (SSH) sessions function, but I think it would still require some extra work for the RDP sessions to get that as well.. Thanks for the translations @wwj402!. We have had several requests for this sort of feature and have decided to focus on integrating KiTTY. The work for this has not yet started, but you can follow #851 for further updates. Currently Uvnc only works through external tool integration. There is an enhancement request to add first-class support for Uvnc (#573). You can follow that issue for further updates\nClosing this as a duplicate. I've submitted a fix for this. It should be available in the next v1.76 release.. Does the View menu -> Reset Layout function work in this situation?. Related to #961 . I've committed a fix for this in 9659ac1. We will now prompt for what to do when decryption fails, similar to how we prompt when a connection file cant be found. This should no longer cause the confCons file to be overwritten.\nThis will be available in the next v1.76 release. Note that the change log will reference #961 since that is essentially the same issue and was entered first.. This was due to a FrmMain minimum size change introduced in 3b9de84\nThe minimum form size was set too high and should be adjusted down.. 400x400 seems to be a reasonable minimum size. The app isn't terribly usable at that size, but most of the UI remains visible and features such as the Windows split-docking work nicer.. I can see how the guide may be confusing. We should place the section for 'using ssh file transfer' higher in the guide and ideally include screenshots.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/SSH-File-Transfer. Although this is a slightly different use case, this appears to be a duplicate of #327. That \"working dir\" field corresponds to the shell working directory:s: RDP parameter.\nI am going to close this request as a duplicate. Please follow #327 for further updates. This is not related to mRemoteNG, but rather a group policy setting set on the server.\nHere are a few articles on it:\n- https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/remote-desktop-connection-not-using-saved/13a17d84-b008-4767-95fb-b891e9e6bc66\n- https://serverfault.com/questions/279661/server-policy-problem-client-gets-your-credentials-did-not-work-when-connecti\n- https://myworldofit.net/?p=1210. Resolved. This will be available in the next v1.76 release. Resolved. The fix will be available in the next v1.76 release. Resolved. The fix will be available in the next v1.76 release. Copying in my initial comment about this from the acceptance testing issue:\n\nThis one has me stumped. I can replicate the issue, but I can't seem to find how this is happening or why. The menu text changes during a system level WndProc() call, but I'm not seeing any C# code that could be causing it. This one may take a bit to track down.. Hmmm interesting. The plot thickens. Moving this out of v1.76. This is going to take time to track down and v1.76 is essentially done. I cant reproduce this issue on the current develop branch (v1.77.0). This might be resolved.. Looks like we will need to make some special accommodations in the ConnectionTreeSearchTextFilter class to handle the special case of newly created nodes.. Just committed a fix for this. New nodes will survive filtering (regardless of the filter) until they leave edit mode. Once their name is set, they will have filtering applied like any other node.. Does your setup look like this?\n\n\nFolder1 (user/domain/password set)\nFolder2  (inheritance set for user/domain/password)\nConnection1 (inheritance set for user/domain/password)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere folder2 and connection1 have inheritance set.. I'm not able to replicate using v1.75.7012 or v1.76.4. We've had a number of reports like what you are describing, but I've never been able to replicate. There must be some very odd corner-case that is causing the issue that I never hit.\nCould you provide an export of a small section of your connection file? Be sure to change the names of hosts/usernames/passwords/domains. I really just need to see the general setup of the folders and the connection that isn't taking the credentials correctly.. Here is an example file that works fine for me. It's currently in the state as defined in step 3. All other program settings are set to default. Tested on 1.75.7012.16846 (portable). I added the .txt to get around GitHub's upload rules.\nconfCons.xml.txt\nI tried a few things with it:\n1. 1 hop inheritance\n    - Created folder1 under the root node, gave it user/domain/pass\n    - Created New Connection in the folder and set it to inherit all\n    - Select New Connection\n    - Run the echo external tool to verify the user/domain/pass are correct\n2. 2 hop inheritance\n    - Created folder2 in folder1 and set it to inherit all\n    - Moved New Connection under folder2\n    - Select New Connection\n    - Run the echo external tool to verify the user/domain/pass are still correct\n3. 2 hop inheritance, overrides parent\n    - Created folder3 in folder2 and set it to inherit all\n    - Turned inheritance off on folder2 and gave it different user/domain/pass from folder1\n    - Moved New Connection under folder3\n    - Select New Connection\n    - Run the echo external tool to verify the user/domain/pass are taken from folder2 and not folder1. @SanderGit That use case will be possible once #208 is implemented. There is also a change being tested in the next v1.76 minor release that will handle saving certain properties on a user's machine rather than in the database. We will be using that to save some flags on individual user machines, but it will also be used for saving credential/connection assignments.. @BloodyIron Yea it's still a beta feature. There are a few things we need to fix about it that isnt ideal.\nAlso, there is a PR to add MySQL support #1177.. Resolved. We now select the root connection node when a new connection tree is loaded. Resolved. It seems that disconnecting a connection consistently causes the message focusing to stop working.\nI've tried adding some lock statements in MessageFocusDecorator.cs but that only fixes a few cases. Somehow the timer we are using gets stuck in the 'on' state but does not raise any events.. It was definitely a threading thing, but I'm still not sure exactly what was going on. I replaced the complicated implementation using Timer with a simple Task async call. Works like a charm.\nThere is one caveat though - I still can't get the notifications form to be shown when its panel is set to auto hide. The new message will be highlighted correctly, but the auto-hidden form doesn't pop up/out like it should when a message is received. I suspect this is just some DockPanelSuite thing that I'm not doing correctly.\nThis line should show the notification panel (and it does for non-auto hidden forms).\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/release/v1.76/mRemoteV1/Messages/WriterDecorators/MessageFocusDecorator.cs#L75\n@kmscode You may know DPS better - any ideas?. Thanks for the PR @Toomix! Since this is a simple fix, I'm going to port this over to the v1.76 release branch as well.. Closing since the underlying library issue was fixed. This is possible for new nodes by setting the default inheritance on the root node.\nClick root connections node -> click the default inheritance button in the Config window (i think its the right-most button) -> set the inheritance values new nodes should have\nThe default connection info / default inheritance will be slightly redone in the future to allow separate default settings per protocol.. Not sure about setting it on a per-folder basis. While it would be possible, we would need to be careful about how it was implemented.\nIt might be possible to make it an assignment-based property, similar to how the new credential management feature is going to work. You could manage a list of 'Defaults' that would represents named default connection/inheritance objects. Then assign these defaults to folders. New connections & folders would take defaults from their parent folder. Folders could also be set to inherit the default values from their parents.. I'm going to close out this issue since it seems the current feature will work for you. You can follow #238  and #239 for further updates on the default connection/inheritance UI improvements. Thanks for the report, @alexmartinio! So far not able to replicate. I think this log entry might be what caused the crash though:\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at mRemoteNG.Config.Putty.PuttySessionsRegistryProvider.GetSession(String sessionName)\n   at mRemoteNG.Config.Putty.AbstractPuttySessionsProvider.GetSessions()\n   at mRemoteNG.Config.Putty.PuttySessionsManager.AddSessionsFromProvider(AbstractPuttySessionsProvider provider)\n   at mRemoteNG.Config.Putty.PuttySessionsManager.AddSessions()\n   at mRemoteNG.Connection.ConnectionsService.LoadConnections(Boolean useDatabase, Boolean import, String connectionFileName)\n   at mRemoteNG.App.Runtime.LoadConnections(Boolean withDialog)\nI've added an extra safety check in that section of code that should help. I need to do a quick release for an unrelated issue today, so look for 1.76.6 soon.. I made a few more changes in v1.76.7 that may resolve this. @alexmartinio and @rhardy613, can you both retest with the new version?. Good to hear @alexmartinio. Yea I've seen them too - still need to look into it. No need to open a ticket. Thanks for checking!. I'm not able to replicate this one, or maybe I'm not understanding the bug.\nHere are my steps:\n\nCreate new config file\nCreate new folder under root node (named \"New Folder\")\nCreate new connection in folder (named \"New Connection\")\nCreate new folder under root node (named \"asdf\")\nCreate new connection in folder \"asdf\" (named \"gggg\")\nMinimize/collapse both \"New Folder\" and \"asdf\"\nFilter for \"conn\"\nNothing is shown in tree (except root node)\nClick \"expand all folders\"\n\"New Folder\" is now expanded and \"New Connection\" is shown (filtering is still active). This seems to be correct.\nRemove all filter text.\n\"New Folder\", \"asdf\", and the PuTTY node are all expanded. This also seems to be correct.. This should be a pretty easy one to do - scheduling for v1.77. The following dialogs now close (cancel) when hitting the Esc key:\n\"Delete connection\" confirmation dialog\nOptions window\nSave As dialog (I actually didn't do anything for this one - it was already working for me)\n\nThis will be available in the first v1.77 alpha release. Feel free to reopen this issue if there are more dialog that you can identify that I should update.. Should this be zooming opened connections as well as the mRemoteNG UI? If you have an RDP connection opened, should it be zoomed?. Ah ok, so in your case you would like this more for console-based connections like SSH?. This was resolved in #961 and released in 1.76.5 (but you should use 1.76.6 due to a bug in 1.76.5). When the toolbars are locked, the \"grip\" section on the left part of the control disappears and the toolbar becomes about 5 units smaller. This causes issues when the settings are loaded back in with a different \"grip\" style. If the quick connect is supposed to be located at (179, 0) but the main menu is occupying some of that space, then the older control in the load order (main menu) loses and gets \"bounced\" to the next available space on the tool strip.\nThis can be solved by ensuring that the GripStyle of each toolbar control is set correctly before applying the desired positions of each item.. Another weird case:\n1. Put toolbars in the configuration shown below. Specifically, the quick connect toolbar is in a custom position with no other toolbar items immediately touching it.\n\n1. Restart mRemoteNG\n1. The quick connect toolbar will have moved to the furthest left position on the toolstrip\n\nThe weirdest part about this one is that there is no immediately obvious conflict going on here. The call to toolStripPanel.Join() just doesn't put it into the requested position of (388,0) but instead puts it at the leftmost position of (184, 0). https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/e6f3c2206493466ae23a92434c9041f6a7fd2cec/mRemoteV1/Config/Settings/SettingsLoader.cs#L221\nIf we call Join() on that item again (call it twice in total) then it is placed in the correct location.. I'm going to consider this resolved for now. Most of the common positioning bugs should be addressed now.. Thanks for the updates @sli-pro!. Closing as duplicate of #321 . Im able to replicate this in v1.76.6 as well. This is happening due to a bug in the duplication process. ConnectionInfos have a reference to their inheritance objects and their inheritance objects also have a reference back to their parent connectioninfo.\nIn this case, the duplication isn't setting the new inheritance object correctly. The chain should be:\ncon1 -> inheritance1 -> con1 so we can effectively reference back and forth.\nBut when duplicating, the chain becomes: con2 -> inheritance2 -> con1. This breaks the chain and produces the odd effect you're seeing, where you click on con2 to change its inheritance, but then when you click the 'view properties' button you are now looking at con1.\nIt's important to note that this bug doesn't survive between app restarts. Saving and then restarting the app will make things work as you expect. That being said, it's still probably pretty annoying. I'm working on a fix now.. Thanks for reporting the bug! This has been fixed and will be in v1.76.7.. The encryption process:\n1. User provides the encryption key (the password used to open mRemoteNG) and the plain text that they wish to encrypt.\n2. The user-provided encryption key and a randomly generated salt is run through the Pkcs5S2 key generation function a set number of times (determined by the Key Derivation Function Iterations option). The minimum number of iterations is 1000. The recommended iteration number is 5000 or greater. This step provides us a derived key.\n3. The derived key and plain text are encrypted with the selected encryption engine/cipher mode.\n   - We currently support 3 encryption engines: AES, Serpent, Twofish\n   - We currently support 3 block cipher modes: GCM, CCM, EAX\n4. The salt and encrypted data are combined and converted to Base64. This Base64 data is what is written to disk.\nA few further notes:\n- By default, only the password property of connection records are encrypted. This can be changed by enabling the Completely encrypt connection file option, which will encrypt the password field as normal, but then also encrypts the entire xml document (except the root xml node, which is required for decryption).\n- By default, a connection file will use a pre-configured encryption key. This is a legacy feature and is not secure at all. It is recommended that you set a custom password on all connection files. The pre-configured key feature is currently being phased out - you can follow the progress on this issue: #376.\n- Related to this, we are implementing a credential manager which will further separate connection details for sensitive credentials. The main goal of this is to let users import credentials from programs who are designed for credential management (KeePass, LastPass, PasswordSafe, etc). This feature has been delayed, but is still planned for release. You can follow #208 for updates.. > Just to be absolutely clear; if the user does not set a password to open the application, a default key is used to encrypt the login credentials.\nThat is correct. The default key is publicly available in the source code. Encrypting using the default key is only marginally more secure than not encrypting at all.\n\nThe credentials are encrypted and based64 encoded and then written to disk. Is this correct?\n\nThat is essentially correct.\n\nAlso, what\u2019s to stop me copying someone\u2019s .XML file and logging in as them?\n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding the question, nothing. If someone has your .xml file and has your password, they have access to the contents of the file.\n\nIt would be great to see a registry key or some other centrally controllable setting so that administrators can control the encryption behaviour.\n\nThere have been a few others that have mentioned similar sentiments (wanting more support for manageing mRemoteNG deployments). I'm not opposed to it, though I honestly haven't thought much about it either.. Closing due to lack of... anything. Duplicate of #1076 - this one is fixed and will be in v1.76.7. I'll try to get it out today. No problem! Some issues aren't named very well / don't have good keywords. Thanks for the detailed bug report though :). Try setting the Use Console Session property on the mRemoteNG connection record to Yes\nI believe the mstsc /console switch was renamed to /admin at some point, though we have not changed our property name to match it.. While technically a bug, I don't think this would show up very often during normal use. Each object GUID is a 128bit value, and the chances of any 2 GUIDs being the same is extremely unlikely.\nThat being said, there are 2 ways we could solve this:\n- The CPU-bound way:\nDetect GUID collisions when modifying the connection list (add connection/folder, load, duplicate). This would require checking through the entire connection list for every operation that changes the collection. As the connection list grows, operation time grows with it by O(n).\n- The memory-bound way:\nStore all connections/folders in a dictionary, with the GUID as a key. We get uniqueness for free at the cost of using more memory (the primary data structure is a simple tree).\nIf there is a data structure that ensures uniqueness but does not restrict child relationships in a tree structure then we could get the best of both worlds.\nWe could also just catch exceptions from systems like SQL when we try to pass non-unique keys, or do a quick validation before trying to save. Then, in the cases where a collision is found, generate a new GUID for one of the colliding pairs. This doesn't solve the issue in our own domain, but at least we can guarantee the invariant every GUID must be unique when data passes outside the application.. Ahh that makes sense, thanks for the clarification. Yes, that can be done pretty easily. Added a fix and a test for this issue. This will be available in the next minor release. 1. That's a fair point and something we can look into. Currently, you can inherit any value from a folder (even ones that don't show up.) We just hide properties that aren't supported for the currently selected protocol. It wouldn't hurt anything to just show all properties for folders.\n1. You can set the default inheritance values for new connections by first clicking the Connections root node, then clicking the Default Inheritance button in the config panel.\n\nThere are 2 enhancement issues open for improving the default connection/inheritance UI: #238, #239. Also, it is a bit unfair to call it a 'mess', regardless of your feelings toward the current system. It took me a few minutes to get over your wording in order to give your feedback a fair reading and assessment. Titling it 'Inheritance hard to understand' or 'Inheritance defaults dont make sense' or something similar would be fair, but 'mess' comes off as harsh.. There is really no way for us to export and then re-import encrypted text using csv format in a nice way. We need to provide a number of details in the .xml format to tell mRemoteNG how to decrypt it. If we do the same in csv format, we need to include that data in every row of the csv. If we provide the encrypted value but no indication of how it was encrypted, then it will be essentially impossible to decrypt it. Why provide the value at all, at that point?\nMaybe we should provide a large warning when exporting CSV with the Password field selected? That way it is very obvious that unsecure stuff is about to happen. Maybe even unselect the Password field by default so it doesn't accidentally get included?. For that matter, the external tools window should provide a similar warning when tools include the %Password% variable. It would be good practice for us to warn users about these clear text password situations.. The TreeListView object has a Filtering event that passes in all current (unfiltered) tree objects. If we listen for that event and set the args.FilteredObjects property, we can essentially override the normal filtering behavior with our own logic. This would let us search within folders and expand folders as needed before returning the list of filtered objects.\nWe might be able to reuse the logic used in the search class, which would cut down on development work.. Though it seems the Filtering event isn't called for TreeListViews... There is a Tree class which we could subclass and then override certain methods on to change the filtering strategy. Then we install it in the TreeListView.TreeFactory property.. Override the RebuildList method on the Tree class. This overrides more than we really want, but this should allow us to change the filtering.. @richlux @kmscode We can add a setting for showing the connection status as an overlay in the tree or as the sole icon for a connection.\n@leaskovski Interesting idea, i like it. Would you mind opening a separate issue to track it?. @SeanTMill Actually, could you open a new issue for that? This issue seems to be largely about the connection icon. Also looking forward to your PR - there have been a few others asking about that feature.. We haven't ever saved that sort of information before, so this would be a new feature. This would be a good enhancement. I am merging this request with #921 since they are duplicates - please follow that enhancement request for updates. Either that or one of these. Depends on which makes more sense in context.\n\n\n\n\n\n. Yea that sounds good, although I'm worried the redesign branch is getting a bit large (and is about ready for merging I think). Could we do a separate PR for this? It would make it easier to code review. I think this is a duplicate of #853. @icysplendor This is likely due to shell meta-character escaping. Try using %!Password% (notice the !) to disable this feature.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#shell-metacharacter-escaping. I implemented the hidpi changes in the UI by setting scaling to DPI, but I'm starting to wonder if it would be better to scale by Font. I don't think DPI scaling is affected by the scaling applied within Windows display settings (scale by 125%, 150%, etc). Vision-impaired users that just need to crank up the display size should also be considered by the implementation. I'll need to test this to see if a change is required.. Hmm after a quick test I can't tell the difference between Font scaling and Dpi scaling. I think I'll leave it like it is. If we get reports of display issues we can revisit this.. Can we get more details about the error you are seeing?\n\nWhich version of mRemoteNG are you using?\nCan you provide the log entries from the time of the error?\nDoes this happen every time?\nDoes mRemoteNG still open, or does it crash?. The only really important file is the connections file. Backups are created automatically on save\nSee https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Backups-and-Recovery. @spisarau Are you thinking something like this?\n\n\n. Ahh ok, an overlay like how we show currently-connected entries. Resolved this bug - it will be available in the next release. There are 2 options for implementing this:\n- We stop hiding the window title bar, which is what shows those buttons. This provides the buttons for free, but adds a few cm of dead space at the top.\n- We reimplement the minimize, maximize, and close buttons as a separate toolbar which can be docked and moved like the external tools toolbar. Do we show this toolbar all the time, or just when in Full Screen mode?. Fixed the translation. Do you get the error message when trying to connect to the server or when setting the loadbalanceinfo property in mRemoteNG?\nIs your server hosted in Azure, by any chance? If so, this might be related to #829 or #523.. Does the value in your loadbalanceinfo section follow the rules mentioned in the \"remarks\" section here? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TermServ/imsrdpclientadvancedsettings-loadbalanceinfo#remarks. Hmm that is interesting. The original reason for #829 was that .NET uses UTF-16 encoded strings by default, but Azure was expecting UTF-8 encoded. It seems like that may be what is happening here as well.\nWould you be able to try the most recent v1.76 version (you can grab the portable version if you don't want to upgrade fully yet)? Turn on the following setting and see if the connection works: Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Use UTF8 encoding for RDP 'Load Balance Info' property. @xlash You can try setting the Use Console Session property for that connection to True (or right click the session -> Connect with options -> Connect to console session). Beyond that I'm not entirely sure what could be causing that error.\n@Shooshka does the mRemoteNG.log file show why the session was disconnected? https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. @xlash Is it working for you now?. @sohnaych No timeline yet. Related to #945 . Added a conditional invoke - resolved. duplicate of #1095. Resolved. Thanks for the detailed report @randman1. I will take a look when I have time. Does this search bar not do want you want?\n\n. @Fyers Could you merge the most recent develop branch changes into your branch? Your code is quite a bit behind the current branch. There will be a few merge conflicts to resolve. @Fyers Looks good now - thanks for your work!. Is this specifically with SSH/putty connections?. Thanks for reporting this @evilbaschdi. I'll be releasing a fix for this shortly.\nThis was caused due to a fix I made for #1110. Goes to show that even small changes are risky :(. Looks like we can set this property like this:\ncsharp\n((IMsRdpExtendedSettings)_rdpClient).set_Property(\"RestrictedLogon\", true);. What version of mRemoteNG are you using?. Thanks @pablomh!. Your best bet is to uninstall v1.75 (from control panel / programs and features) then try to install v1.76. \nI'm not sure why the upgrade install isn't using the cached msi in %windir%\\installer\\ though. I figured that is what WiX does by default, but maybe I need to look into that.. You can try to reinstall/repair the old installation (it will need to be the exact same version that is/was installed). That should re-cache the msi and allow you to uninstall or upgrade to the newer version.. You can try to manually uninstall using the steps below:\n\nRemove all mRemoteNG files from the install location. (Default is \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\mRemoteNG\")\nDelete the following key in the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\{81E5E36D-C131-4AB8-BABD-BA124F28AF1B}. Fixed this - it will be available in v1.77. To resolve this, I think I will disable saving the connection status to the database. It doesn't make sense that the connection status would be saved to a shared location anyways. That property (along with several others) should be saved on a user's local machine to prevent the issues seen here.. Since this is a pretty annoying bug, I'm going to fix it as a hotfix to v1.76. The fix for this will be available in v1.76.12. We can now save certain properties locally when using the database feature.. I've been able to replicate this too, but only in the released version. Trying to debug this in a debug version of the app does not cause the error. Haven't tried debugging the release version yet.. I was able to hunt down the issue - please see below\n\nShort version\nWe can't fix this for v1.75 users - please download and upgrade manually through the website or GitHub. \nLonger description\nmRemoteNG v1.75 was compiled against .Net Framework 4.0 which does not contain support for TLS1.2. Since GitHub is our web provider for downloading updates and they have disabled TLS1.0, any in-app update attempts using mRemoteNG v1.75 will fail.\nThere are hacky ways to enable TLS1.2 support for apps compiled for .NET 4.0, but honestly it's not worth the trouble. The only thing the in-app updater does is download and run the normal .MSI installer (or download the .zip if using the portable version).\nmRemoteNG v1.75 users will need to manually update their version. v1.76 users will not have a problem since we updated to compile against .NET 4.6.. Looks like this was due to the switch from targeting .NET 4.0 to 4.6.\nFor some reason we now need to account for SystemInformation.HorizontalResizeBorderThickness and SystemInformation.VerticalResizeBorderThickness when resizing the putty window. They must have split the SystemInformation.FrameBorderSize.Width and SystemInformation.FrameBorderSize.Height properties to add these new measurements.\nI've committed a fix for this. Why not use the normal saving functionality? It encrypts passwords, offers full-file encryption, and can be saved anywhere (including google drive/dropbox folders).\nAre you using the export more like a backup feature?. Are you able to consistently cause the crash? What sort of things are you doing in mRemoteNG when the crashes occur?. Does the crash provide you a stack trace?. @amousa1968 Can you check your Windows Event Viewer for any related events that occur just before an mRemoteNG crash? The Application log is the most likely to have something, however the System log may also have details that could be relevant.. I'm not sure what could be causing this issue. The logs don't provide us much context on what is going on, and ntdll is such a core library that anything could have called into it.\n@kmscode Any ideas?. @amousa1968 Are there any .dmp files for mRemoteNG in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\CrashDumps?\nIf so, please email the latest one to support@mremoteng.org. I'm going to try to get it out today. Closing as duplicate of #449. Implemented by @MitchellBot in #1160 \nThis will be available in v1.77. As mentioned, this is a duplicate request. Please follow #420 for any updates. Is this using RDP? Does the same thing happen if you try to connect with a different client?. I'm sorry that is happening @garybaer :(\n\nAre you using the installed or portable version?\nIs mRemoteNG writing the settings file? (file paths found here)\nAnything worth noting in the mRemoteNG log file? (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging). Yep, I'm the current main developer of the project.\n\nRegarding the settings file - it should at least be writing something somewhere. It might even be writing to a directory that isn't the the \"most recently updated\" directory as reported by Windows.\nThe following powershell one-liner should tell you where the highest-versioned settings file is on your system (just looks in %LocalAppData%\\mRemoteNG).\npowershell\nJoin-Path -Path (Get-PathVariable -Name \"LOCALAPPDATA\") -ChildPath \"mRemoteNG\" | Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory | ?{$_.Name -match \"\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\"} | Select-Object -Property @('FullName',@{Name='Name'; Expression={[Version]::Parse($_.Name)}}) | sort -Descending -Property Name | select -First 1. Good to hear @garybaer, glad it's working. Thanks for the patch @st-schuler. I will merge this to the develop branch but also patch it into the most recent v1.76 branch so we can release it right away.. Sorry that is happening @richard-scott. Few questions for you so we can narrow things down:\n- Does this happen every time you take the steps you outlined above, or is it intermittent?\n- Does this happen with any other RDP clients (mstsc, RDCMan, etc)?\nThe stack trace indicates the issue is in the RDP library when it tries to call from a .NET managed wrapper to an system COM object. It is likely a bug with that specific build of Win10.\nThe only change in mRemoteNG that might have caused this to manifest now is we switched from compiling for .NET 4.0 to .NET 4.6. That change along with your Win10 build could be the reason for failure.\nI haven't been able to replicate the bug on a Win10 14393 build. I think I have a machine with 1709 or 1803. I can retest on that when I'm home.. @GhostTW Hey, just wanted to check in and see how things are going. Is there anything I can do to help keep this PR moving?. @GhostTW I see what you mean. I tried playing around with the OnRequestGoFullScreen and OnRequestLeaveFullScreen as @popofe mentioned, but I'm not sure how to properly handle full screen mode with an AxHost control. I can get the total drawing area to be correct, but it still attempts to draw within the ConnectionWindow container rather than drawing across the entire monitor. The location is like (300, 150) rather than (0, 0).. Yes, it is possible but it's a little bit of work to get set up. I think the only thing you really need is a Form on which to display the ActiveX control. Already working on it :)\nDuplicate of #208, please follow that issue for updates. Should be a quick test/change to make. It's probably calling the Close() methods to start disposing of controls... I wonder if we can override that in a reasonable way. We could add some default external tools.\nSince we don't include an existing external apps file, I would implement this in code. I think I would have it add these default tools on the first run of mRemoteNG if the external apps file is empty. This should mimic being included in the installer.. Duplicate of #1096, please follow that issue for more details\nWe are going to add a setting to switch between an overlay and a standalone icon for connection status. Are there any events in the Application or System logs in the windows Event Viewer?\nHave you tried uninstalling and reinstalling that version of mRemoteNG?. The image didn't come through - it just shows up as text:\n\nApplication error below. If I install the latest version that verson opens ok but I cannot import the configuration file so I lose all my progrmamed connections. \n[cid:image002.jpg@01D46F88.F9F056A0]\n\nHave you tried reinstalling the version of mRemoteNG you are currently using (rather than the most recent version)? The error you posted originally indicates it was this version: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/tag/v1.75.7012. Still no picture - I don't think email attachments get posted to github.. Currently we just take whatever is in the Username field of the connection record. This doesn't work when using the Connect (without credentials) option, as you have found. We can fix this for some protocols, but maybe not all of them.\nFor RDP:\nThe OnUserNameAcquired event fires when the RDP connection receives a username. It provides the login user information as domain\\username. We can use this to update the tab name even when using the Connect (without credentials) option.. Duplicate of https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/1135#issuecomment-429641183\nPlease download the update from the website and update manually. More details in the link above. Added the labels for you @MitchellBot, thanks for calling that out. Looks good - simple and it works. Thanks for the PR @MitchellBot!. Have you tried to right click connection -> Connect (with options) -> Connect to console session?. Did some quick googling and found a few posts that actually say to turn that option off. Does that connection have the Use Console Session property enabled? Or maybe it's inheriting it from a folder?. Could you provide more information? I'm not sure what the issue is or what you are trying to do. Ahh I understand now. This is a known issue - please follow #1134 for further updates. That would be a putty setting, though I don't think Putty has anything like that. To my knowledge, you can only change font/background for the entire putty session.. Please see this comment: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/1135#issuecomment-429641183\nClosing as duplicate. What is the protocol of the connections that cause this bug? I'm not able to replicate the issue with an RDP session open.. Ok, thanks for checking.. Seems to only be an issue when themes are enabled. Interestingly, disabling then enabling either the connections or config window (View -> Connections) stops the bug from occurring.. But then alt+tabbing away form mremoteng makes it come back... Fixed the issue - the fix will be available in the v1.76.12 release. @leaskovski Cool! I took a quick look at your changes and they seem good - open up a pull request and I can take a deeper look. This is likely due to the fix for #1136. We had to update the putty window positioning to account for some new window data.\nThis might be an OS specific issue. It's likely that Win10 was the only one affected by that issue, and we need to check for some property (maybe just OS version) when calculating the putty window position offsets. If win10, use the new calculation, otherwise use the original calculation.. So far I haven't been able to replicate this issue. Still looking into it.. @otiecoyote Are there any other details you can provide about your putty/mremoteng setup? I have not been able to replicate the display issue you've described using the following settings:\n\nWin7 SP1 x86\nmRemoteNG (portable): 1.76.11.40592\nmRemoteNG (installed): 1.76.11.40527\nPuTTYNG (default, no changes to default session configuration)\nThemes disabled/enabled. Thanks for putting this together @mjbnz! Just took a quick look through the changes and things look pretty good. I wanted to give you a heads up that a few DB changes are being introduced in v1.76.12. I will be merging them to the develop branch in the next day or so. It introduces the ability to save certain properties locally rather than to the DB (#1180).. > I would specifically like to start looking at having updates be written to individual entries, rather than dropping and refilling the table every time.\n\nI agree, that has always bothered me. Have you worked with Entity Framework before? I would like to redo the DB functionality in EF Core. It will allow us to handle DB migrations easily, add support for more database types relatively easily, and provide a fairly easy way to do CRUD operations in code.. @mjbnz I would suggest doing any larger improvement work under a new branch and PR - we will keep this one just for the MySQL implementation in its current state.. @mjbnz The changes are now merged into master - pull from upstream for the latest. Let me know if you have any questions about the changes. No problem @mjbnz, thanks for checking in. @thewreckingcrew6 It will likely be in v1.77. We currently do not have a release schedule for v1.77 though. It is in early development. Hey @mjbnz, hope you are having a good holiday season. Just checking in to see if there is anything I can do to help with this PR. @kmscode Yea, that would probably be easier overall.\nI also started working on some RDP changes that would allow users to select the rdp version they wanted to use for a connection and allow show what is available on the machine at runtime. This would allow us to completely remove the prereq checks from the installer.. Thanks for working on this @popofe! I will try to test this in the next week.. We now save certain properties to a file in the same dir as the mRemoteNG settings file. The file name is LocalConnectionProperties.xml.\nAt this time, the following properties are only saved in this local file:\n- Connected. Whether a connection is active. This is only relevant when the Reconnect to previously opened sessions on startup option is enabled.\n- IsExpanded. Whether a particular container is expanded or not.\nFor simplicity, all nodes save all properties, whether or not the property is relevant for that node type.. Implemented in 78bf402 and 0427956. Hi @KvnSC! Yes, this is a known issue with the current implementation and something we are looking to address. The next hotfix should resolve some of these issues (folders expanding on their own, for example).. It sounds like your settings file is either never saving preferences or being deleted. Since you are on the portable version, the settings file saves in the same directory as the mRemoteNG.exe file and is called mRemoteNG.settings. \nIf you watch this file while doing your mRemoteNG startup workaround, does the file ever update? If you do the workaround then close the app immediately, does the file update then?. Yes that seems very odd. The version you posted in your OP (1.76.11.40592) is definitely the portable version, which doesn't need to be installed (just unzipped). It needs write access to the dir the EXE is located in. The installed version (1.76.11.40527) writes its data to the user profile (as you were expecting).\nIt sounds like you may have overwritten your installed version with the portable version. I agree that it's probably best to make a backup of your connections file (to be safe) and completely uninstall/reinstall mRemoteNG using the MSI installer.. I think this is related to (or maybe duplicates) #945 and #1114 (multi-select support).. Fixed in 1e4fa84. I think I see what you are after, but I want to clarify:\nCurrently:\n- A staff member who is in the comp lab will manually login to each machine using a generic account (ex: lab_user) and perform the setup.\nIdeally:\n- When setup needs to be done, someone lets you know and you send a command to a set of computers that will begin a local user session using the generic account (lab_user). Now the staff member in the comp lab can setup the testing environment without worrying about the \"login\" step.\n- The reason VNC/RDP is not a valid solution is because you are not doing the testing setup yourself, you just want to make things go smoother for the computer lab staff.. This tool might do what you want: https://www.logonexpert.com/help/command.html. Install the tool on any machine you need to login to, then run le.exe -logon <details> from cmd line using either powershell remoting or PSExec. I haven't used this tool before and I haven't tested it to see if your use case works as expected. \nI'm not sure how it performs the login step on the local machine, though I can guess that it might be using the auto-logon feature of Windows (and then disabling it right away after the logon has succeeded).\nThis workaround might do what you want as well: https://superuser.com/questions/80334/remote-desktop-connection-without-locking-the-remote-computer#415829. Login to each box via RDP then run the tscon command to transfer the session to the local machine. Haven't tested it myself but seems like a valid solution.\nTo my knowledge, there is no built-in way to start a local user session from the command line. At some point in the process, Advapi32.dll+LogonUserA gets called. Though I'm not sure if there is a higher function that should be called to ensure things like profile info, logon scripts, etc get called correctly.. The following localization entries were changed with this PR and should be updated for other languages:\n- strConnectionEventErrorOccured\n- strProtocolEventDisconnected. > It's possible that the scheduled Credential Manager functionality expected in 1.77 will also help in this regard...\nThat's a good point. We could add something in the quick connect control to allow you to select a credential for the connection.\n\nIf the connection is successful, it would then ask me if I wanted to save the connection.\n\nThis would also be a decent feature by itself - convert a quick connection to a saved one.. Duplicate of #1135 \nPlease see this comment: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/1135#issuecomment-429641183. @JRB68 Which protocol causes the hang? RDP? VNC?. Thanks for taking the time to update the script @sk82jack. Things look good, I've just made one comment to address in the code. Looks good, thanks for taking the time to update this script @sk82jack!. Thanks for taking the time to make these updates @nmat! I finally have time to review some of the changes.. At the moment I'm in favor of a having docs saved along with the code and generate docs with sphinx. Here is my reasoning:\nPros:\n- GitHub wiki pages are saved in a separate repo, and even though you can checkout and submit pull requests for a GitHub wiki, it's not very easy. Having the docs alongside code makes it easier for the community to get involved and help (like this PR).\n- Having the docs alongside code makes it much easier to support several versions of documentation at a time. (I think this is the biggest benefit)\n- We get much more control over our document formatting with Sphinx + reStructuredText.\n- We can use something like readthedocs.io for display/hosting\n- As @nmat mentioned, we could generate API docs in the future if we want\nCons:\n- GitHub wikis are easy to create and edit for maintainers and generally look pretty nice. This would add a little bit of extra work to update docs.\n- Adds another build step to generate docs (adds complexity)\n@kmscode Any opinions?. @nmat Here is a git patch that should resolve the csproj merge conflict you are seeing. Apply it with your favorite Git tool or from the command line with git apply 0001-fixed-merge-conflict.patch.txt (working dir must be the solution folder).\n0001-fixed-merge-conflict.patch.txt\n. That's sounds ok. Continue updating the HTML files as you have been and then we can migrate to a new system later.. @nmat Let me know when you are ready for a final review & code merge. Merged - thanks for all your work on this @nmat!. Hey @leaskovski sorry this has gotten delayed. We are trying to determine how to keep your work on this feature alive given the work being done in #1258.\nIt turns out the the dockpanelsuite (DPS) library does not currently support the option to completely hide the tab strip. The library maintainers have stated they do not intend to implement this feature themselves, but are open to PRs.\nWe are discussing the possibility of doing the implementation work ourselves and submitting this to the DPS project as a part of this currently open issue: https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/559. We think we have a valid use case that the DPS maintainers may not have considered and are confident that they will accept a PR.\nWith all that being said, we are still going to merge this PR as is. The work was done well, it's still a feature we want to implement, and it would have been accepted without reservations before the work to remove the magiclib library. The caveat is that the actual tab hiding implementation will be disabled once #1258 is merged. We will hopefully have a replacement implementation available to us for the release of v1.77.\nThanks for you work @leaskovski!. > Is this client only? Installed in the client side but nothing in host?\nThat is correct, this program is only a client. There is no installation required for the server. I agree with adding a sub-option for only showing hierarchy info on the tab if a duplicate item is open.\n\nOpen tabs check may arise some questions such as case sensitivity, white space handling etc.\n\nThis seems reasonable:\n- White space is counted. host 1 != host1\n- Not case sensitive host1 == Host1. > However, I did notice that Jenkins run OpenCover\nWe never really did anything with the coverage results, so I wouldn't invest too much effort into keeping OpenCover. I'm not opposed to keeping it either though.\n\nHow does Jenkins update the channel files currently? I couldn't find that (unless I missed something).\n\nThe post build runs this script and archives the output files for viewing after the build completes.\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/develop/Tools/create_upg_chk_files.ps1. You can run PS scripts against connections using the External Tools feature. May be duplicate of #1195. Thanks for reporting this @KKostikov. Could you provide a screen shot of what you are seeing? This will help us when trying to reproduce the issue.. Thanks @KKostikov. Does this happen immediately after connecting, or does it work fine for a while and then start showing those odd characters?. I think this is sensible - merging. Usually I don't mind adding configuration options, though this one I'm on the fence about.\n@nmat If the search bar was more visually distinct from the buttons, would that improve things? Or does it just feel weird that the search bar is at the top?. That's fair. We can make it an option with the default set to bottom. That looks good - would you mind opening a new PR to add the config option?. Looks good @farosch. Have you had a chance to test it on a machine with HiDPI?. Fixes #990. The help file changes in this PR conflict with #1201. We are looking into changing our help files to another format to unify the in-app and GitHub versions of the documentation. @farosch I agree with the change to the web links opening in an external browser, feel free to open a PR for that. @farosch I think that having some UI design guidelines would be great to have. Since you have been doing some work in the UI lately, feel free to start writing some up and we can discuss them in this issue.\nI'll start off with a few:\n- All forms must have their AutoScaleMode property set to Dpi in order for DPI scaling to be correctly applied\n- Ensure all forms and user controls can be opened in the Visual Studio designer. This typically means ensuring the form has a parameterless constructor.\n- Use the NG version of a control (found in UI\\Controls\\Base) if one exists. This will ensure the control is correctly styled.. In an effort to prevent issues like #1238, I also suggest the following:\n- All localization (such as ApplyLanguage()) should occur in the constructor of the form/control rather than in an event handler (such as OnLoad()).. - If using the Visual Studio UI designer on a HiDPI screen, ensure Visual Studio is running in DPI-unaware mode. We assume all design work is done at 96 DPI. This will ensure the correct display of UI elements across devices. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/disable-dpi-awareness-visual-studio\n\n. I'm going to start compiling these into a document. I don't know if there is a convention for naming code style documents, so how about just calling it DesignGuidelines.md?. This is a known issue. Please see this comment for more information: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/1135#issuecomment-429641183. This is a known issue. Please see this comment for more information: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/1135#issuecomment-429641183. > I moved the reconnect button from the tab context menu to the first position. It felt a little off in the middle of the tab handling options:\nIt also feels weird having Reconnect/Disconnect in different places. \"Duplicate Tab\" is also essentially just \"Duplicate Connection\", which fits the theme of connection state management. The only one that doesn't really fit with that logic is Rename Tab.. I'll concede that Duplicate and Rename Tab probably aren't used that often. Another option would be to move both the reconnect/disconnect stuff to the top.\n```\nReconnect\nDisconnect\nDisconnect Other Tabs\nDisconnect Tabs To The Right\n\nFullscreen (RDP)\n...\n```. Though changing the location of those items really doesn't fit within this PR, since this is for fixing some localization issues.. Yes, that might be best. I've tested the changes and they seem to work well. We will want to add an option for this functionality.\n\nI don't know if it is desired to insert it into the existing list somewhere around another similar option or just append it to the bottom.\n\nWe typically group up options that do similar things, so I would insert this option between the Single click on opened connection in... and Set hostname like display name when... options in the mRemoteNG.UI.Forms.OptionsPages.ConnectionsPage class.\nLet me know if you need help with any of this. Merging - the user option will be easy enough to add. In general I like the new flat icons, though I think we will want to fix the pixelated icon. We can either do that in this PR or do that in a new PR if it will take a while to research.\n\n. I'm not a big fan of the pixelated version - I think the normal one looks great. Yep, it fits in a little better now :)\n\n. @kmscode You good with this PR as it is?. Would it be enough to add a Reconnect menu item to the right-click menu? I'm not sure why anyone might need duplicate connections to the same host, but the current functionality provides the option to do that.. This seems to be due to the ApplyLanguage() call being in the form's OnLoad event handler. The form's TabName property is set to the default \"Connections\" value until the form is loaded, then it changes to the correct \"Verbindungen\" value for Deutsch. Moving ApplyLanguage() to the very end of the form's constructor fixes the issue. I'll submit the fix for this shortly.. To help with this, we could also add a Test Settings button to the security page. Clicking this would serialize and encrypt the current connection file and report on how long it took. This can give the user an idea of what the 'cost' of changing certain value would be for them. It is possible that very small connection files could use extremely large KDFI values with little impact.\nKeePass also has a feature where you can set the KDFI value to whatever value makes the encryption process take ~1 second. This is a very easy way to allow users to set the maximum security settings for their systems that also won't greatly impact their general use of the application.. Given that it is a commercial solution, it is unlikely we ever will support Radmin. If their protocol was open source or they provided a freely distributable client API, then it would be possible.. @kmscode Seems to be slightly faster, but still takes an oddly long time to show the form.. Cancel that, tried in a non-debug build and it was better. Implemented in ce371e4. Do we see this with integrated apps too?. The dll gets copied to a temp location on every run of the installer. The file it attempted to run during the install that your log file was from was %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Temp\\MSI3877.tmp. This file name is not likely to be the same between install runs.\nIf the file is getting copied to the temp dir correctly, it may be a permissions issue when trying to execute the dll. Are there any security restrictions on your machine that might be interfering?. Thanks for following up @ap-nsx, glad to hear there's a workaround. I noticed one thing when testing reconnect - the Close() method seems to get called twice. For RDP this doesn't seem to be a big issue, but with PuTTY it throws an internal exception since the process has been disposed. The first close is called from the reconnect method, but the second seems to be an event handler called from the tab OnClosing event.\nPutty.Close() -> Tab.OnClosing -> Putty.Close() -> Exception\nThis isn't a huge deal since it is caught and doesn't actually affect the app state at all, but it is an unnecessary exception that gets logged. Not sure how to prevent the duplicate calls to Close() yet.. RE: the PuttyProcess.Dispose(); hangs, they only seem to occur during a debug session when F5/F10ing over the Dispose call. Normal runs of the app (even while debugging) don't seem to have the issue. (Remember to remove the call to PuttyProcess.Close();, since that also internally calls Dispose on the process).. I seem to sometimes get the \"theme change - restart required\" popup when setting an unrelated setting and clicking \"Ok\". There might be something wrong with the show-popup-notification logic. Needs some investigation to determine the root cause though.. One minor optimization we can make is to remove any Settings.Default.Save() call within individual settings pages. It is already called once in the Ok button event handler. > the setting to run the components check on every startup should be an option in the actual settings\n\n. > single click setting (first two checkboxes under connections)\nwhen both are enabled an exception is thrown when clicking a connection in the tree\nI get this exception - same for you?\nSystem.InvalidCastException\n  HResult=0x80004002\n  Message=Unable to cast object of type 'mRemoteNG.UI.Tabs.ConnectionTab' to type 'mRemoteNG.UI.Window.ConnectionWindow'.\n  Source=mRemoteNG\n  StackTrace:\n   at mRemoteNG.Connection.ConnectionInitiator.SwitchToOpenConnection(ConnectionInfo connectionInfo) in D:\\Repositories\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\Connection\\ConnectionInitiator.cs:line 56\n   at mRemoteNG.Tree.SwitchToConnectionClickHandler.Execute(ConnectionInfo clickedNode) in D:\\Repositories\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\Tree\\ClickHandlers\\SwitchToConnectionClickHandler.cs:line 23\n   at mRemoteNG.Tree.TreeNodeCompositeClickHandler.Execute(ConnectionInfo clickedNode) in D:\\Repositories\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\Tree\\ClickHandlers\\TreeNodeCompositeClickHandler.cs:line 18\n   at mRemoteNG.UI.Controls.ConnectionTree.OnMouse_SingleClick(Object sender, MouseEventArgs mouseEventArgs) in D:\\Repositories\\mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\UI\\Controls\\ConnectionTree\\ConnectionTree.cs:line 426\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnMouseClick(MouseEventArgs e)\n   at System.Windows.Forms.ListView.WmReflectNotify(Message& m)\n   at System.Windows.Forms.ListView.WndProc(Message& m)\n   at BrightIdeasSoftware.ObjectListView.WndProc(Message& m)\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlNativeWindow.OnMessage(Message& m)\n   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlNativeWindow.WndProc(Message& m)\n   at System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow.Callback(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam). > seem to only work after a restart but does not show a prompt\nThis should be resolved in the latest commits to the branch. Maybe one showing the external tools management and/or using an integrated external tool?. Dev note: any fix for this should be tested on multiple OS versions, MRNG themes, and on a HiDPI machine.\nThe fact that this has been an issue several times before tells me we haven't found a good fix for it. Might need deeper investigation into the current method used for finding the putty window's system border width.. Dev note: start investigation in the ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler class. Here are 2 user cases for how I would expect it to function:\n- If someone drags the connections window to a different screen (floating) and clicks the \"go to\" button, it should not redock the window to the main mremoteng window.\n- If the connections window is closed (not just hidden) and the user clicks the \"go to\" button, the connections window should be shown and brought into view. If possible, in the last location the connections windows was placed before being closed. If that proves too problematic, then the default left-dock is fine.\nSide note: we should probably be documenting these cases somehow. Eventually I want to create some automated ui acceptance tests, but for now the Acceptance Testing page is the best we have for collecting these sorts of expected behaviors.. Related to this: we should have a way to determine if a DPS panel is a \"connection\" panel or a \"connection group\" panel.. Is there anything in the log file or was a crashdump produced?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging. Which version of mRemoteNG?. The only way to allow mRemoteNG to support VNC4+ is to setup VNC viewer as an external app and set your connection to use the Int App protocol and select the VNC external tool. The downside of this is that you cannot pass the Password property directly to the VNC connection (the vnc viewer parameter list only specifies the Username property).\nMore details on creating external tools here.\nMore details on our support for RFB protocol versions 4+ here.\nClosing this as a duplicate of #494. Thanks for the fix @V0174!. It is likely that #155 solves this issue since we removed the library that did the paneling. This will be testable in v1.77. > 1 credential record that is used by all 5 hosts\nThis is correct. Each connection info is assigned a credential id that ties it to a single credential record. The actual credential information is pulled from the credential service when it is needed (for display, start a connection, external tool args, etc).\nWhen a file is imported, credentials are harvested alongside the normal connection info data and a map of connection->cred assignments is made. The newly imported connection data as well as the credential map is passed along, which is where this form picks things up. The user may want to see which credentials were found and potentially make adjustments. Most importantly though, we have to know in which credential repository the new credentials should be saved.\n\nIf it's the later, then there would need to be some adjustments to the described design to select a credential record or create a new one if necessary. The credential record selection would replace the user/password fields.\n\nThis has already been done. The connection info object still technically has these fields, but they are deprecated. There is a CredentialRecord property that serves as a helper for determining which credential record is assigned to the connection. Though for the purposes of this import screen we will be dealing directly with the credential records.\nI should probably write up a wiki page for this stuff.. Started writing up a page: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/The-Credential-Management-System. I dont see any reason why we wouldn't be able to use the existing variable replacement engine used by the external tools. Shouldn't be too difficult to implement the changes you've proposed.. Do you have the following setting set to something other than None? My guess is that this is where the domain value is coming from.\n\nYou can also try the following for that connection:\n- Set the username field to administrator\n- Set the domain field to .\nThis should ensure that the domain is set to the local machine.\nYou are correct that we don't currently parse the username field for domain info.. Dev notes:\nIt looks like the following fields are added to .rdp files when signed:\n- signscope:s:\n- signature:s:\nWe would need to add support for the signatures line at the very least.

This will not be possible for some protocols (e.i. RDP). It is either only disconnecting (not logging the user off) or your local machine is on the same domain as the remote machine. To my knowledge, there is no native way to log a user off of a remote machine that is on a different domain than your local machine.. We could add a new specialConnect` context menu item that lists the available credentials to use.\nConnect (with options) -> Connect using credentials... -> (list of loaded credentials). This should be relatively easy to add in for v1.77. It looks like this is due to the TblRoot not having any data yet, so we have no way of verifying the encryption key. I'll have a fix for this shortly.. Does the mRemoteNG.log file show anything? (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging). Thanks for providing that, that does help narrow it down a bit. I will look into which property may be causing the issue..

Es freut mich, dass die Gemeinschaft zusammenkommen kann, zu diese \u00fcbersetzungen verbessern. Es scheint, dass mRemoteNG in Deutschland ziemlich beliebt ist.. @farosch I'm good with the changes - let me know when you'd like this merged. @farosch looks like there are a few merge conflicts now since @kmscode did a bit of cleanup. @farosch merged. Makes sense, i have no issue with this. Nice to see we are (for the most part) following changelog best practices.\nOur issue grouping could maybe be better (we order entries within a section by github issue #, descending).. I would be in favor of displaying the page via a markdown parser. I would definitely still like to distribute the changelog with the app.. Yea, hiding element might be the best option. It's not a big deal, I just wanted to get it documented in case someone has time to look at it. It's just a \"polish\" issue really.. @kmscode im good with it in 1.77 as well. I fixed up the merge conflicts on my local copy of this branch and tested. I think it looks good to merge. @mRemoteNG/developers any objections? I'll merge it tonight if not.. RFC @kmscode @farosch @jotatsu . @farosch All looks good to me.\nWhat would you think about having a Favorites folder within the quick connect dropdown too?\n\n. Cool, that looks good! Merging. You can try reinstalling/repairing the old version (1.75.7012) and then try to uninstall it, though I don't have great confidence that it will work.\nIn the mean time, I will create a wiki page for doing a manual uninstall.. Added a wiki entry for manual installation: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Installing#manual-uninstallation. >I think the best one should be that you kept older./archived versions of old mRemoteNG on your server\nOlder versions (going back to v1.72) can always be downloaded here: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases. Or https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG -> click the Code tab -> click the Releases button near the top-middle of the page. I don't think prepending the translation strings with str is useful. We already know it's a string and it takes up space.. Yea, that seems sensible. I'll replace the icon today. Yep, looks good to me. Thanks for the PR @konpl!. @MatsAnd Are there any crash dumps available? https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Logging#crash-information\nDoes this happen immediately on the first RDP session you attempt to open, or does it work for a few connections than crashes?. The work for this has been done under #929 and will be available in the first v1.77 alpha. App settings are saved in the same folder as the portable exe file. If you do not copy the settings file over to the new directory, the setting for encrypting the entire connection file will not be enabled in your new version of the app. (I believe that is what is happening here, but please correct me if I'm wrong.)\nThat being said, I agree that this is an issue. The solution would be to manage the \"full encryption\" setting within the connection file itself, rather than making it a global app setting. For technical reasons, the connection file already has a flag on it to say whether it is fully encrypted or not, so this wouldn't be a big change. We would just look to that flag on the file rather than an app setting to determine whether to do full file encryption.\nWhat this would mean:\n- We would move the \"Fully encrypt connection file\" setting from the Options page to the root Connections node in the connections tree.\n- When a connection file is saved, we check the \"fully encrypt\" setting on the connection tree of the currently loaded connection file to determine whether full file encryption is applied.\n@mRemoteNG/developers Comments/objections?. > store and use it in a single place - connection file\nThat is probably what we would go with. It would be too confusing to have a global app setting and a per-connection file setting.. I will look into this right away. Found the issue. I will be releasing a fix for this tonight. v1.76.16 will be available shortly. Please update to this version. Unfortunately, you will need to set your gateway username fields again.\nThank you for reporting this issue and sorry for the disruption it may have caused. Some connection properties (whether a folder was expanded, which connections were active when mremoteng last closed) are now saved to the local machine (%AppDataRoaming%\\mRemoteNG\\LocalConnectionProperties.xml) rather than to the database.\nIs there something in your environment that would prevent this file from being available between executions of mRemoteNG?. I should also mention, if you are using the portable version, the local connection properties file is saved to the same directory as mRemoteNG.exe. The installed version of mRemoteNG saves the file to app data roaming. It should try to update the local connection properties first, before trying to save to the DB. Is there anything in the log file that might explain things? \nI haven't tried setting the database itself in read-only mode when testing this, so it could definitely be a bug.. No problem! I'm actually going to open a new issue to track this (#1354), I would expect that we should still be able to save local connection properties if the db user only has read access. You shouldn't need to set the mRemoteNG option for this to work correctly.. This is likely the same issue as #532. This will likely be solved by the HiDPI fixes we implemented in v1.77. I'll look into removing it, though it might be more complicated to remove it than to just ignore it due to how default MSI installers work.. Tagging fixes as comments in the code isn't required (actually preferred not to have it)\n. For those that are running the beta, line 490/491 will throw an error due to the XML node not having a value (and .Value will be called on a nullref). Users coming from v2.5 confCons wont have this issue, but it'll be good to keep our beta users happy :)\nWe should really be adding guards against this everywhere, its just more noticeable in this case.. Yea, pretty much. You can even inline this by using the null conditional operator and then the null coalescing operator.\ncsharp\ncollectionOfInts[\"abc\"]?.Value ?? 0. Looking better - still need the null conditional operators. Trying to access the Value property on a null value will still throw an exception. The bonus is that this will fix the failing unit tests.\ncsharp\ncollectionOfInts[\"abc\"]?.Value. Here's the source of the issue for my last requested change (name/description not showing up in the config window).\nYou have strPropertyNameRDPMinutesToIdleTimeout set for the attribute on line 89, though the actual name for the localized string is strPropertyNameMinutesToIdleTimeout. Same for line 90. This will need to be changed to pull in the correct (non-empty) name and description.. \ud83d\udc4d Looks good! Just fix up the localized name/description fields for the inheritance properties and I think this PR will be good to merge.. This section will work now, since the localized string vars were changed.. These localizations need to be changed to match the new variable names that were changed in the last commit.\nline 230 should use strPropertyNameRDPMinutesToIdleTimeout\nline 231 should use strPropertyDescriptionRDPMinutesToIdleTimeout\nChange these two and I think we will be good.. The current code enforces the timeout value restriction (0-240) by either ignoring or truncating the value provided by the user. Ideally, we wouldn't even let a user enter an invalid value. Or at the very least let them know immediately that the value will not be the one they assigned.\nI'd move the validity checks to the AbstractConnectionInfoData.RDPMinutesToIdleTimeout setter property. That way if someone tries to enter an invalid value, the actual value displayed in the confCons file and the UI will be corrected. The end user will be able to see the real value being used for timeouts.. Thanks!. We could make the prompt optional. Shown by default, but include an 'always accept certs' sort of check box. Best method for implementing might be to request a class that can handle the override via property injection.. Rather than adding this as a region, let's make this its own class. That way we can reuse it elsewhere if needed and frmMain wont get any bigger. Include a summary from MS about this message type:\n\"The WM_CHAR message contains the character code of the key that was pressed. \". You will need to also add a InDefaultMultiMonitor setting as well, to control the default inheritance.. This will work for installed versions of mRemoteNG, but portable versions will not have a registry entry. If no version was installed on the machine, the later assembly load will fail. Could a prompt be added if no reg entry is found?. We are ok with minor fixes like that, no need to squash.. Its only really necessary if a value needs to be encrypted. If any of the password fields are empty, are inherited from a parent node, or filtered out through the SaveFilter, then no encryption happens (we write an empty string).\nMy guess is that in your case the password field was empty.. I'm getting a \"page cannot be displayed\" for this link on my machine. Is it working on yours?. We can delete the Bin Package section - we don't provide this package.. Change to something like:\n\nThe setup package is the compiled version of mRemoteNG which comes in an MSI installer.. Remove 2008 - that way we don't need to update this file when updating the solution file. This part is no longer true for the Portable version (though it is still true for the normal version). Portable saves all user settings in the same folder as the mRemoteNG.exe file.. I would change the phrase \"a test\" to either \"an indicator\" or \"an icon\". I think we are missing an image or some text here. I think we are missing an image or some text here. This may also be a good time to show the Duplicate Ctrl+D shortcut to create several hosts within My Domain A. Go through setting up the Test connection and then show how you can create Test2 and Test3 records fairly easily.. \"ask about\" => \"asking about\". Change \"Saves the current connection file open.\" to either \"Saves the current connection file.\" or \"Saves the currently opened connection file.\". For this and the next 3 items, change \"current selected\" to \"currently selected\". Typo in \"mRemoteNG\". \"...Useful if you are organised with panels...\" This phrase doesn't work very well, though I'm also not sure what to replace it with. Maybe \"Useful if you have many panels...\", but then the last part of the sentence will need to change as well.. These links are also broken for me when clicking them in mRemoteNG - maybe need to use href=\"Help\\SSHFileTransfer.html\"?. \"a already created\" => \"an already created\". Thats a good point, i don't think we do some of the file moves in local builds that are done during the release builds. That may be something we should change.. I'm getting an unhandled exception due to this line - the credential page needs a page icon. I will also commit a fix on the develop branch to prevent these sorts of issues from throwing exceptions. The CredentialsPage still needs its PageIcon property set to the correct icon (mRemoteNG\\mRemoteV1\\Resources\\Icons\\FamFamFam\\shield.ico). Re-adding the above highlighted line will fix the issue.\n\nWithout that, we get the default icon as shown here:\n\n. Lets use the PageIcon = Resources.Panels_Icon; style as seen in the AppearancePage constructor. That seems much easier to follow than the designer generated value.. Looks good now :+1:. See my general comments on the PR about the Dispose call.. If we rename these, users who have set one of these themes will encounter an error when we try to load a theme that doesn't exist.\nWe should either not rename these, or include a \"redirect\" to allow for the slight naming difference.. Yep, I am getting that hang when typing exit in my session. No hang when closing connection through mrng (X on tab, disconnect from tab menu, disconnect from tree).. Maybe no further change is necessary. I'll do some more testing around this.. Should connection favorites be shared among all users or specific to each user? If we both share a SQL DB connection list and I set connection \"app-001.example.com\" as a favorite, should you also see that as a favorite? I could see reasons for wanting this to be a personal or shared setting. \nIf you think that sharing the favorites is important, you can leave this as it is.\nIf you think it should be a personal setting, revert the current changes to the database/schema files and instead update the following:\n- LocalConnectionPropertiesModel\n- SqlConnectionsLoader.ApplyLocalConnectionProperties(ContainerInfo rootNode)\n- SqlConnectionsSaver.PropertyIsLocalOnly(string property)\n- SqlConnectionsSaver.UpdateLocalConnectionProperties(ContainerInfo rootNode)\n(Being forced to type out the steps to add a single property makes me realize we need to refactor the local connection properties code. It's ridiculous that we need to touch 4 completely separate places for 1 change.). I think you transposed these two tests when copying. The UserFieldNotifiesOnValueChange test is setting the Favorite setting, and the FavoriteNotifiesOnValueChange test is setting the UserField setting. Update comment. ",

We currently use {{ site.github.xxx }} metadata in order to get certain URLs.  If in the future GitHub decides to change those URLs, the metadata will be able to return the updated information without any rework.\nAlso, I'm not quite sure what the .pot file does. The site gets pushed and built by GitHub, and I'm not familiar with a .pot file with Jekyll.\n. I'd say this doesn't keep the site as simple as possible, as it'll need a different build system than just pushing to GitHub.  I don't have access to the analytics, so I can't even say if translations are going to be impactful.\n\nIf they are however, I'd be more welcoming to this method as it still stays in the GitHub build system.. First version here.  Once it's okay I'll link it in the Wiki under User Manual.. https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Active-Directory-Import. https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Quick-Connect. https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/Export-to-File. Not automatically with the GitHub API unfortunately.  I could put a blurb about checking the changelog for checksums.. The current changelog link goes to pages like this.\nWe could keep a database in the _data folder, but would need to keep track of all the versions by hand.. I don't know much about Jenkins, but I believe that'll do it.  That db will hold all of the versions, so we can have that past releases table if you'd like.. In addition to this, though a bit specific to my setup:\nI keep the config file in a network share that get's backed up to AWS S3, which does versioning on it's own (this may apply to other backup software too).  By having the filename include the date, it creates a bunch of files in S3.\nIt's not the worst problem, but if I could also chose the backup naming scheme, then I could do something like backup1, backup2, and backup3 and have them rotate.. Well that's unsettling. The code committed yesterday outputs the same link as before, so I'm not sure if it's that. I'm going to check more when I can get to my desk in a bit..

I put bugs and feature requests. They're all over here. Seems you forgot some info there.  Can you edit your post to fill out the issue?. There is a trigger for new releases, the relevant integrations would be\n- https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/github/\n- https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/pages/#request-a-page-build\nLooks like once the GH release is successfully published, you'll want to POST to https://api.github.com/v3/repos/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/pages/builds and make sure that you add the header Accept: application/vnd.github.mister-fantastic-preview+json. Sounds good to me.  I can imagine we can get the main window with a good list of servers and open connections in one screenshot.  Any ideas of other screenshots, or should it just be the one main screen?. I think I'll submit a PR while reformatting the whole changelog so it's consistent. Couldn't it be rendered with Markdown Parser?  It doesn't even technically have to be rendered at first, since it's still a plain text file.. I did about a third of the restructure last night, so it's coming along. \nHere's what it'll look like without a parser.  I took some very light liberties in reformatting the structure to be as consistent as possible so if we want to in the future, it can be parsed out programmatically.\nThat Markdown Parser I posted earlier is for UWP, but Commonmark.NET should work.

Proposed for 2.0, this could require a better command style interface internally. . Proposed for 2.0, this is integrated by O.S uri association types and a better scriptable external interface for creating connetions. . Can be reproduced in the lastest version of 1.77 develop. Temporary workaround is after the bug is produced, clic fullscreen again and the rdp appears in the tab.\nScheduled for 1.77 release. Put in 2.0 for long term usage. This would require multi clients for protocol so mRemoteNG can mix internal and external clients. . Candidate for 1.8 as an improvment of 1.77 credential repository.

This kind of already works in the UI of the dev version . The grouping is normally done by the executable name, but we can add more field like category and group by them.

One thing to add here, lately i've been building the installer version lately for testing and the postbuild event always fails.

The contents of the pane itself (when expanded) could use a redesign, but that'd be another ticket. I think you can close this, as it's no longer relevant (since the new default location of the notification pane as part of RemoveMagicLib is much better).. @kmscode @sparerd This came up before... I understand that you want to compile the app against an older framework so mRemoteNG works out of the box on older versions of Windows. However, if there are optimizations which will make the app run better and if you want to be able to use C#5.0, I think we should consider upgrading. If you look at the audience of mRemoteNG users, most are IT professionals, tech people or developers. They should know how to install the latest version of .NET if they don't have Windows 10/Server 2016. (Although considering many users you'd be surprised). You already need to install  hotfixes in a specific order to get this working on Windows 7, so what's the difference?. This is the setting that would need to be added to mRemoteNG if available in the RDP libraries provided by Microsoft. I'd assume it'd be a boolean true/false option whether or not to use all monitors for full screen connections and the inheritance would work the same way as all other folders/features.\n\n. Verified that smartsize and fit to tab work correctly. Ignore my External Tools issue - I see it's working fine now.\nRegarding the last item on the list which is unchecked (the tab disconnect), it's partially fixed. When I disconnect, I can now double click the server in the connection pane and it will reconnect again. However, when disconnected, the connection panel still shows the play button even if the tab's been closed. I'm not sure if it's just a GUI issue or if it's still actively connected but not visible:\n\nI also noticed that right click on a tab/tabbar and screenshot does not work.

    "igor2x": "Just my two cents. The following bug on JIRA was pointed to this Github bug:\nhttps://mremoteng.atlassian.net/browse/MR-883\n. Hi,\nI try adding export NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1 to .bashrc and logout/login and this solution does not work for me.\nIt looks on this machine language is set to POSIX, executing 'locale' command.\nI have read a lot of forums and this was most helpful:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/475925/how-to-fix-putty-showing-garbled-characters\nI don't want to mess with language settings on machines because everything else is working without a problem, the only exception is yast not displaying characters properly.\nTemporally I have fixed this problem by adding bellow text to .bashrc file\nalias yast='LC_CTYPE=sl_SI.UTF-8 NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1 yast'\nWhen executing yast from shell it sets variables before starting yast.\nIt is still interesting that mRemoteNG 1.74 on the same Linux machine works without a problem, but mRemoteNG 1.75 does not. In my humble opinion it also got to be something in mRemoteNG that has changed from 1.74 to 1.75 related to this problem. It may not be Putty, it may be something in mRemoteNG or similar.\nIs there anyway I can debug this problem in mRemoteNG?\nI know it looks like something related to environment, but why does 1.74 works without a problem and 1.75 has problem displaying lines in yast?\nThe best variant in our case would still be to debug problem in mRemoteNG and fix the problem without changing Linux environments on this and many may many more machines.\nRegards. Hi,\nnow I have gone through all of the Putty settingS at my colleague and compare them with my settings and I have found out there was one setting in my colleague NOT present in mine settings.\n\nmRemoteNG: Tools | Options | Advanced | Launch PuTTy.\nWindow | Translation | Remote character set | by default setting is set \"UTF-8\", but at my colleague using mRemoteNG 1.74 it was set to ISO-8859-2 (Latin-2).\n\nThe scenario was likely the following:\n1. He installed 1.74 many years back and then he changed above setting to ISO-8859-2 and most probably FORGOT about this setting.\n2. Then he downloaded 1.75-portable with of course default value \"UTF-8\" tested \"yast\" program and it was not displaying lines correctly. He assumed there is some regression problem in 1.75-portable.\nWe did the test:\n1. We downloaded 1.75-portable again on his computer and in Putty have set to \"ISO-8859-2\" and yast is working fine, displaying line characters correctly.\n2. Then we downloaded mRemoteNG 1.75 (non-portable) and installed it over existing mRemoteNG 1.74 and of course ISO-8859-2 was still present from 1.74 version and now yast is also correctly displaying characters. PROBLEM SOLVED.\nIn the end, we are not planning to change any setting on server environment. I asked why is the language set to POSIX and not to UTF-8 on ours Linux servers and got response that there are some proprietary products that do not work correctly using UTF-8, so Linux servers are set to POSIX environment language setting instead.\nAt the end it looks it was a setting problem after all. Sorry for false report.\nRegards. I have exactly the same performance problem with default mRemoteNG VNC connection being so slow it is almost unusable.\nI have also configured UltraVNCViewer as mRemoteNG external tool and left UltraVNCViewer default setting and now mRemoteNG displays VNC like a charm it is now very responsive and nice to work with.\nI set the following arguments in mRemoteNG external tool:\n\nI made a print-screen. It looks at least VNC is doing some compression and other optimizations:\n\nThere is UltraVNCViewer source code available at https://sourceforge.net/p/ultravnc/code/HEAD/tree/UltraVNC%20Project%20Root/. ... may I add additional simple task related to forum. On Tools | Components Check at \"ICA (Citrix ICA) Check\" last sentence is:\n\nIf you are still not able to pass this check or use ICA in mRemoteNG please consult the mRemoteNG Forum at http://forum.mremoteng.org/\"\n\nMaybe just remove above whole sentence. Isn't it obvious if someone has problem to search for Help menu and see the forum?\n. ",

    "pedro2555": "@kmscode Just took a bit to read on SSH.NET, and it doesn't seem to support SSHv1, which PuTTY does. Any plan on that?. @kmscode Is this any different than pressing ENTER on that dropdown?\nBecause from what I can see that is the part missing, the ENTER functionality. The panel was replaced with the dropdown button, but the connect functionality never was.\nSo, enter IP TAB use selection keys to select protocol ENTER, and you're connected; is a bit different, I admit, but does the exact same thing using the exact same input, the keyboard.. I have not much time to look at this at the moment.\nBut you may check https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/v1.75Hotfix8/mRemoteV1/App/CompatibilityChecker.cs, if you want to get an insight of exactly why you are getting that message; maybe you can work around it for the time being.. I've been looking at this for a bit, and couldn't quite figure what the issue, is. Is there a test case one could setup quickly?\nAnyway, just my 2 cents about the encrypt, decrypt thing on the ConDefaultPassword; where is this a miss? It kinda seems a simple check, am I missing something?\n/Config/Settings/SettingsLoader.cs#L68 Decrypts\n/Config/Settings/SettingsSaver.cs#L65 Encrypts\nWe could do this at runtime admittedly, best way is just to implement a type/class for it (I guess mRemoteNG.Security.EncryptedSecureString) and use that type on settings configuration directly, and let the SettingsProvider handle the saving and what not.\nBut, again, I could not see what the reported problem is exactly.\n. This is somewhat a common issue in .NET, I say an issue but it really isn't it's just that there is no implementation provided by the .NET framework.\nBut this is achieved by extending the SettingsProvider class, by your own.\nThere is a C#, MIT licensed implementation of such on GitHub. I'm just getting into the project so I'm not sure I can tackle this in any meaningful time, since there maybe some to consider on this project.\nIf someone else could do a quick look at the repo and see if it play with mRemoteNG, would be nice. Once I get a free time I will also.. @kmscode it seems, but it is stopped since 2014. There is actually one fork, 1 or 2 commits ahead of the original tree.\nI'll have a free time in a bit, I'm cloning the project at the moment.. I think this is more likely to work out better with #719 and #706, when all finished.\nYou would need to change things a bit on your side. But you would be able to use the connections tree to organize your stuff by then.. Can you elaborate a bit better, I think this is inline with something I would benefit from myself.\nIf I understood you correctly, you want to be able to execute mRemoteNG and automatically connect to a specific connection you have on the connection tree.\nEither via command line parameters or other setup.\nIs this correct?. Thanks, one problem I can find quickly, is that connection names aren't unique across folders.\nAnyway thanks for your comments, we will look into this.. Its one approach for sure, probably not the best for memorising thought \ud83d\ude04 \nDisclaimer, I hate the GUID concept, like Globally Unique, it takes guts to ensure that.. did this never worked? or did it break at some point?. Ok, looking a bit better at this, and don't think this ever worked. So, I would re-implement this really.\nServiceStack.Text is the perfect fit, we can even extend this to JSON with the exact same effort!\nI've never really used it, but ServiceStack is pretty well established, and it promises something like:\n```csharp\nusing ServiceStack.Text;\nstring CsvSerializer.SerializeToString(T value)\nvoid CsvSerializer.SerializeToWriter(T value, TextWriter writer)\nT CsvSerializer.DeserializeFromString(string value)\nT CsvSerializer.DeserializeFromReader(TextReader reader)\n```\nAny considerations on this?. I think is nicer to actually connect to the thing. I might be looking into this.\nThere you go: VMware API and SDK Documentation. why is this still open?. First, just be sure here, you are running the external app with the Try Integrate option checked, is that correct?\n\n. Ok, thanks.\nI asked because you said the apps simply open on a separate window and that is not what I see from here.\nAnyway #710 should fix, and a couple other issues with the integration part. If you're able to pull and test on your side it would be great, otherwise the next patch should address this.. Probably fixed by #705 . Can you check that this behaviour is fixed for you on 1.75.7008?\nI could confirm this is not the case on my side, all hostname/IP exported and have been imported successfully.\nUsing latest version as of today 1.75.7008. Thank you sir for the help.\nIf one of the admins could mark this as closed. Thank you.. it seems to break every now and then when debugging, I'll continue looking into it.. @kmscode \nThanks for the help. Guess I missed the Wiki part of the deal :P, sorry my bad. But that should actually be noted in the readme.\n\n\nGreat, fixed.\n\n\nI will take develop as the main branch then, and for now PRs to patch9\n\n\nMaster. @dekelMP thanks for checking in. I did not.\n\n\nI'm deleting that script for development and pasting back in before pushing, pretty annoying... Nop. Same thing.\n\nI'm at 6aaf2f03, VS Community 2017 if that helps.\nAnd I probably should mention, before you try anything else. Those projects are not loading on my system, and that may be it. I haven't look into them at them at all.\n\n. @kmscode I'm closing this for now. I'm not really interested in building the installer, so it may take a while for me to look at this; if ever.\nIt is not preventing development/use in anyway, so, yeah better close this.. This a bit odd.\nThe bash shortcut points to C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe ~, but I could not find such file on my system! (and I do have that feature installed)\nAs a workaround you can open a Command Prompt (C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe) and then type bash; it opens the bash shell. Actually tested this with PR#706 and when switching to the bash environment it actually cds to the correct path (/mnt/c/Windows/..); until that you'll get mRemoteNG starting location.\nNote: also any batch or command file, with the first line #!/bin/bash is executed by windows on the bash shell and not as a Windows batch script.\n@kmscode this does not seem to be an issue of mRemoteNG, even creating a new shortcut just equal to the default one, bash.exe is not found, seems that only the default shortcut and the command bash do the trick.. @jelez Works perfect\n\n. I agree.. connected and before_disconnect scripts, maybe?\nThat actually sounds useful, having the option to script commands to be sent to, after a connection; or even to clean a connection before closing it (can't really think of anything, but I'm sure someone else can).. Yeah, I think I can see why..\nHaven't looked into it, but I think log4net is actually breaking when it tries to log anything, but the exception must be captured by that library (I think it is safe to assume so), and its transparent to us.. @kmscode you're welcome, just remember to close the issue, so the guy that was actually suffering gets the message :).. Just noticed VS did a mess there with git. There's nothing wrong with the code, its just that VS did a mess there with git (I guess copy paste to/from a linux shell did a mess with the line breaks).\nI will leave this here for you to pull and test on your side if you wish. But I'm going to fix that mess in a bit, just so one can read the diff.... Remote Desktop Web Access.\nIf you want to host it, you could just leave it on a windows machine and use RDP to access it.\nIt is not exactly browser based, as you might expect, and requires a Windows client to work, but then is just a question of downloading the RDWA shortcut for your application, it is then run on the server and rendered on the client.. Fixes:\n487\n414\n690\n. Should be an easy merge, whenever you do it.\nBut I sort of agree with you, although the portable version is admittedly broken.. Implemented the whole UI, and the feature itself is ready to ship.\nJust missing that internationalisation part I'm not really sure how to go about.\nWhile doing this, ended up finding and fixing a small bug where the filename wasn't updated on the ExternalTool instance when changed via the file dialog Browse button.. > I agree with making this a configurable option\nme too, I'll keep that in mind for when I have a bit. @kmscode Yes, I agree. Removing line 66 is no solution; hence I asked feedback.\nI think this needs a bit of rethinking, after reading on the subject for a bit.\nAnyway we go, I don't think assuming is ok (in assuming cmd.exe is a CLI app), we could ask, or try, assuming is always dangerous (is known to be the main cause to bugs, btw). Your second approach is a bit more in the likes, but I will look to it more carefully.\nFor the the other lines, their kinda of broken in the current release. If you want to merge the fix for those, just tell me and I will submit a PR for that.. @kmscode Ok, lets do like this. I've added the WaitForInputIdle line back, and you can just merge the other two typos if you want.\nThe rest of the weirdos I'll send a separate PR. I've done some trials on this just now, and this requires some sort of intelligence from spawning the process to finding the correct handle.\nBy the way, in the Git Bash case you mention, the specific issue there is that git-bash.exe actually spawns mintty.exe and that's the one hosting the terminal window. I was able to search for child processes of git-bash.exe and grab the MainWindowHandle of mintty.exe, and there you go.\n\nAnyway, if you wanna merge this (with the WaitForInputHandle back), it fixes #649.\nAnd maybe open an issue for an enhancement on the IntegratedProgram class?. You're passing a username and password to filezilla via the arguments option on the external tools window, correct?. Just confirmed this, and it does happen.\n\nThe password is bit more trickier to test, but I think is safe to assume has the same issue.. Oddly, this took quite a while to understand. (probably needs some comment decoration around this code anyway)\nYou probably need this.. @kmscode don't worry too much. I posted this because it had just happened to me.\nWhen double clicking the connection/folder name to allow renaming in place, when the control loses focus I'm getting a 500 to 2000ms stuter.\nIt might be due to a known issue in Windows 10 with my hardware. I'll post a link to the issue asap.\nAnyway, I will look into it when I can find free time.. @kmscode Not sure about it, but probably was just a miss on some driver part on my side. Updated windows last night, and all seems fine.. They are\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/External-Tools#variables. I've just made a big round of testing yesterday, and I could not find any issue.\nCan you post the full argument string you're passing to the external app?. It seems neither username or password are set, then.\nDoes it work in a supported protocol? SSH, RDP? I suspect it doesn't.\nYou either have the credentials set explicitly or via inheritance, you must have one of those set for the connection you're trying to use, otherwise, if there is no username/password set, they will be blank as you report.. @sparerd thanks, looking later today.. Have no ideia why this is falling. The test suite fails on my side as well.. it is minor.. This probably happens for all params... Should be ready now, fixes #676 on my side.\nAnd should have no problem merging with #704.. @kmscode ok, hit me up if you have any doubts on #704. It is actually pretty simple.. I guess the issue was not having the encryption key, at the time of decryption.\nSince you appear to have moved the same code to latter in the logic. Am I correct?. Yep. Thats exactly it.\nWe've been basically decrypting with an empty key.. Backup and delete %AppData%\\Roaming\\mRemoteNG\\pnlLayout.xml, and report if it fixes it.. thank you, I've noticed this issue once before.\nI'll take a look, but low priority really; since this is most likely an issue with the library we use.\nThanks for files.. Also the docking stuff as a lot of work still to do.. @kmscode I'm returning here, before saving the settings file, simply because this was done as such in Startup.cs lines 293, 299, and 306 as of d15e444cb79aeb8f6e0b90b5687276e71ddc1400, which is where I'm branching from.\nBut I don't think that is correct, there is a bunch of stuff that can be set by the console parameters, and since we return here, we're basically ignoring them.

I can also vouch for KeePassRPC and have had very few issues in general with similar KP plugins.\nMy use case.....  I've integrated 90% of my daily admin environment and toolset inside of mRemote; I use it to integrate everything from web apps and external utilities, as launcher for a library of powershell, bash and other scripts, as well as a wrapper for notepad++ and VSCode + more. Sometimes the performance is clunky or slower (especially when it involves IE or Gecko), but it works most of the time, and it's made work much more streamlined.  This integration would bring the last major piece into one app for me (and many others), and would bring the added security bona-fides of KeePass to mRemoteng..

Note that due to this issue, and the spacing at edges, it's quite difficult to resize panels properly, as the edge seems to line up with the internal putty window most of the time, and it becomes very tedious to ensure that the right resize anchor is selected. \nLarge impact on usability and feel, and this is regarding a system (panel UI) that I've always had issues/difficulty with, but this is too much of a regression and obstacle to put up with.

Future enhancement maybe?\nWhile definitely possible via scripting, it could still be very useful to build-in and provide a simpler, more streamlined method to set up for those that either don't know how, or like me that tend not to configure unless absolutely needed, simply because it's a hassle with low ROI, but when I use Terminus on my Android phone, I'll set this up across the board when needed because it's baked in.\nCheers,\nM\n. Is it a focus issue where the application loses focus (check the title bar for color solid or not on W10).  I know I get focus issues where I have to select somewhere on titlte / panel bars before I'm able to ineract with the conn/cfg panels again.

Mremoteng.exe is a 32-bit program. To avoid the redirection, specify the path as c:\\windows\\sysnative\\dnsmgmt.msc. There is no sysnative folder in Windows directory, but specifying the path should work.\nUnfortunately I did not have an occasion to try it out for you, but I'm using this technique to start 64-bit cmd.exe from a 32-bit application.\nOne more thing: Sysnative trick is available since Windows Server 2008.

I tried this because my current file is quite big, 7mb, or so.\n. Thanks for checking in. Yes, often I cannot close windows with the X. Some menus in windows don't function, and for example I can never click the start button. I can bring the start button up by pressing Alt Home, but I cannot ever click it. In task manager I cannot reselect the applications tab after having selected one of the others. The other tabs will all remain selectable, but not Applications. Often I cannot click highlight, or select any of the icons on the desktop. As soon as I choose log off the remote PC, and log back in, they all become active again, and it is just like I was sat in front of the PC, as per normal.\n. Okay, it looks like you are onto something. It would appear to be the left and top edges. If I can still grab a window, such as task manager, and I move it to the right, I can then access the things on the left. If it's low I can select its top menu items and the cross, but if I move it to the top I cannot access any of the things at the top. It is exactly like there is a strip to the left and across the top which is 'hiding' my access. Again this is only when I reconnect to a PC that is already logged in. Force a remote log off and start again, and all is perfect.\nTo prove, kind of, that it is only the left and top, I can always access the small 'Show Desktop' button in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, at the end of the task bar.\nHopefully this extra info will help narrow it down.\nOnce again your assistance is much appreciated.\n. Smartsize is on for all all connections. Changing/toggling the setting has no effect. Making the window size change, with a different resolution, has no effect either, so even when I have to scroll, because of a resolution mismatch, these areas of the screen remain inaccessible/unclickable. A very low resolution, giving me a window in the middle of the active tab, so it has a blank surround of its own, within the tab, still doesn't make any difference. Always the top and left are inaccessible. \n. I was, though I had no idea I'd made that change. If it can be invoked by some odd key presses, I must have done that, because I'm sure I didn't do it deliberately.\nAnyway, great news, because that cracked it. Reset it to 100% and now it is working exactly as it should and as it always did.\nThank you so much for that suggestion.\nI feel a little blind now, after having got used to it, and the resolution of my screen is too high, but maybe I can adjust that, just using normal screen resolution options, without causing an issue. Normally laptops say, that is not the optimal resolution for the display, but this one doesn't seem to mind. I'll experiment with it tomorrow and see if changing the overall resolution, rather than scaling it, will give me a better outcome.\nThanks again, and thanks sparerd for walking me through the steps to identify exactly what the issue really was, i.e. the invisible border issue.\nNice one guys.\n. I couldn't resist taking a look at it right now, and I was wrong that my laptop doesn't whinge about sub-optimal resolution, however I found a much lower setting with the exact same aspect ratio and as far as I can see there is nothing negative about running it at this lower resolution, but there is a significant plus, in that I can actually read it, lol.\nHaving changed it to a readable resolution, but having left the scaling at 100%, everything now seems perfect.\nHonestly I can't thank you enough.\nAwesome!\n.

In regards to the redirect not working, I will do some digging to find out why. I can't do it right at the moment, but should be able to sometime later tonight.. @kmscode Hey, sorry for such a delay. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find the answer to this. I will post it to stackoverflow and try my luck there.. Hello Charles,\nI am no longer working on this feature. I had (at the time) implemented the\nfeature per how MSDN said it should be, but we couldn't get it to work when\ntesting. Eventually, I had other things come up that took time away from\nwhat little time I had.

So we have multiple users under a single folder for terminal server connections.\n(Image below for reference)\n\nAll of these connections connect to the same hostname tserv.[redacted].com\nThat's just an example of how my work uses it. I manage my server by having all of the connections under the same folder, but they all connect to the same IP.\nJust thought it would be nice to have \ud83d\ude04 . Would a fix for this be checking if the XML nodes are null before referencing .Value and if they are, get the defaults?. @sparerd I just pushed the commit using the null-coalescing operator.

I would classify that as a security bug. Suggesting a system level disable of FIPS is really bad from a security point of view.\nWhile getting mRemoteNG certified might be useful for higher security environments I think the actual need here is much simpler. We need to do the minimum to allow mRemoteNG to install and operate on a FIPS compliant system. This simple use case does not require mRemoteNG itself to be certified. It simply needs to stop doing things that are incompatible with FIPS compliance.\nOn a system level, that in theory should be relatively simple to do but I'm not familiar with the code base. That may be as simple as having mRemoteNG default to encryption algorithms that are FIPS compliant. If it is necessary to support legacy systems where the current encryption algorithms support is missing fallback to the old methods either based on a config options or as an automatic fall back. Personally I wouldn't expect supporting legacy systems that don't support recent encryption algorithms needs to be a priority but that's up to the developers obviously.. It would be really nice to have this addressed sooner rather than later.\nNeeding to turn off the FIPS registry key to be able to use mRemoteNG\ncauses a lot of issues for end users.\nOn Tue, December 18, 2018 12:29 pm, jsalian27 wrote:\n\nThanks, so should I wait for next release to get this fixed?\n--\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/222#issuecomment-448302687\n\n.

Thanks a lot :). new PR issued (#791). wouldn't it be more consistent, to use the same graphics as the mRemote-logo on the homepage?\ne.g. something like this? (beware: quick and dirty)\n\nI also think the two colors are a real distinct design element that people instantly associate with mRemoteNG and thus shouldn't get lost\nAlso these color would be better to fix issue #681. Same thing for the header:\n\n. #806 Since I was bored, here's another PR so you guys can have a look at what I have in mind.. @kmscode @sparerd This was just a quick thing I did in GIMP. If I get a go for this design I will replace all files and provide PSD-templates.\nWhat about not only letting users chose the Icon but maybe make a little competition about it? Let users have some time to send in their suggestions and later make a poll on the homepage? We could spread the word on social media...\n. I was also thinking about something like this:\n. closed in favor of #1232 . @seijied You are running an outdated version of mRemote. Does the issue still exist on v1.75.7011?\nPlease update and specify what \"instabilities\" you're exactly experiencing.. Closing this because of the time that has passed and because of @seijied never responding on the issue.. Detail | Value\n-- | --\nOperating system | Windows 10 x64 1709\nmRemoteNG version | 1.75.7012.16814\nOne of my colleagues and I are having the same problem. Unfortunately none of us have been able to reproduce it yet. I will report back here as soon as I find out when this happens.. This seems to be the same issue: #354. @teimahu @notes90\nJust found you can still use special characters when you press CTRL additionally.. Adding a space behind a username is not a security measurement, it's just adding a character.\nJust like the login name Users isn't safer than User, it's just longer. Usernames are nevertheless readable through the UI so there's no advantage here, if anything it's a disadvantage for users copy-pasting usernames.\nSince you're talking about RDP I'm guessing you're talking about Windows machines. Windows does indeed allow spaces in usernames, if they are not at the end or beginning, and these are not trimmed off by mRemoteNG.\nSo I don't see any reason why this should be implemented.. You really need to start answering questions if you want us to help you ;)\n-What protocols are you talking about?\n-What kind of operating system are you connecting to?\nTo get back to your question: NO, currently there is no such feature to disable trimming of login names. It could be easily implemented if you can give us a reason why it should be.\nI have nearly 1000 machines in my configuration, all different operating systems and protocols and have never in 5 years needed the possibility to have leading/trailing spaces for a username.\nLinux does not allow spaces in usernames at all (like most other operating systems) and Windows does not allow spaces in usernames when trailing/leading, so why should it be possible to do so in mRemoteNG?. Yes, I can open and built the solution just fine. As a workaround you can enable this\n\n. Have you tried the SQL implementation yet?\nI think this should fit your needs and is designed exactly for what you are wanting.. I think the first connection after filtering should also be automatically selected - unfotunately I am unable to do this myself. Can be closed. See above comment and #1201 #1223 #1228 . Redisigned that form, to at least reduce the possibility of elements being clipped off to a minimum. This is the smallest the form can be atm:\n\nMaybe increase the minimum size on the main form so that there is a definite minimum space available for other forms to be shown inside the main form?. @sparerd No, I have not. But I think I found out how to reproduce the bug:\n1. Filter for a connaction that is in a nested folder\n\n2. Collapse a folder obove the connection\n\n3. After emptying the search filter string the connection panel looks like this:\n\n. This would be solved by #944. Not the cleanest way though, but a quick solution anyways.. It seems like I have been too impatient.\nThere is no loop in the code, it just takes forever to complete. I have a connection file with ca. 390 connections. When sorting alphabetically it takes about 4 minutes to complete. 83 config backup files will be created in %APPDATA%\\mRemoteNG during the sorting (~100MB).\nThis has not been an issue in earlier versions of mRemote, unfortunately I cannot tell with which update it became slow.\nI have sent you an email with my configuration file for you to make some tests, if needed.. This is already possible if you activate this in the settings:\n\nThe tab of a disconnected rdp session will then stay open showing this:\n\n. Just checked out the latest develop branch and the error seems to be already fixed . @CHAVYZ Are you using puttyng or mremote to initiate the connection? Does the problem also occur with the normal putty client?\nSince it works fine for your cisco switch I think this could be a problem with the JDC \"Nepting TPE\". Have you tried to telnet from you windows command line?. Sorry for the delayed repsonse, I've been quite busy. Maybe this animation will make it a bit clearer:\n\n. #1332. @Hovn \u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u7248\u672c\uff08v1.76.16\uff09\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u652f\u4e2d\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u7ecf\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e0ev1.77\u4e00\u8d77\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\n@Hovn I was able to recreate the problem with the current version (v1.76.16). In the develop branch the problem is solved already and will be published with v1.77.. @sparerd would this be an appropriate icon to do so?\n\nIt's the textfield_delete.png from famfamfam. I think  or  would be best for this context.\nI'd like to go for the keyboard one as it is a little less striking.\nIs this alright? If so I'll push another commit to my redesign branch to include this.. True. I'll create a new PR for this. That's probably a bad idea to implement. Maybe as a optional feature but even then I'm pretty sceptical.\nAt least this should never be a default. Since we're detecting the host status by it's response to a ping we would need to permanently ping every single host to have a reliable indication.\nThis could be a neat gimmick for people with ~20 connections but for everyone else with a big list of hosts this is nothing but redundant network traffic.\n@spisarau If you need to be able to monitor your servers try to look into something like openitcockpit or grafana.. @Stef-33560 Take a look at THIS\n.NET 4.7 is included in Windows 10 since the creators update (1703). This includes all versions (Home/Professional/Enterprise).\nSo as long as you are running any Version of Windows 10 > 1703 mrng will run out of the box.\n . Same as #1324. More info here.\n@mdio33  Feel free to reopen this if you need further support!\nClosing as this is not directly related to mRemoteNG.\n. I just did - same result.. @sparerd that was it! I unintendedly inherited this setting onto the onnection. It then tried to connect to the console session on the server, which is impossible for a non-admin account on a terminal server.\nSorry for this non-issue ;). @nmat Just something quick I did:\nCould you be so kind as to maybe checkout and test this branch?. @vupv To what Version of Windows are you trying to connect to?. @vupv This seems not to be an issue with mrng. Most likely this is related to the server you are trying to connect to. Error 3334 can occur when you have reached the limit of rdp connections (which would fit your statement, that it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't)\nAs this is a relatively old issue and you have yet missed to answer any questions from me or @nmat I will close this issue. If you still need support on this topic feel free to reopen this issue.. @nmat Just checked out this branch. What you did so far looks really neat! I like it. I guess we both agree that at least something hast to be done documentation-wise.\n@sparerd What are your thoughts on #1201 and #1223. With which one do you guys want to go with?\nI'd be happy to help @nmat to copy over the changes he made to the wiki, just in case.\n. @sparerd Okay, these are some valid points I didn't think about. Especially \n\nHaving the docs alongside code makes it much easier to support several versions of documentation at a time. (I think this is the biggest benefit)\n\nmakes it a deal-breaker to put all documentation into the github wiki, I guess.\n. Related to MagicLibrary, see #155.. You made the same issue over at tigervnc which kinda makes me think the real problem here is your macOS Mojave.\nNevertheless you need to provide at least some information. If you want people to solve a problem for you at least take the time to describe your problem properly. \"Not working\" is nothing anyone can work with.\n. I wouldn't call five elements in two rows cluttered, but I think this should be fairly easy to implement if desired.\nI initially just wanted to clean the UI a little bit without introducing more lines of code, but I guess I could give it a shot. @sparerd What do you think?. Branch is updated with the possibility to set the search bar position from settings.\nJust PR if you like it @sparerd . \n. That's how it looks atm. Didn't think about that. I just tested it on my fathers surface and it does indeed not display as intened on a HiDPI device. Will update this branch to consoder HiDPI devices.. As explained by you and @nmat in #1201 I now think this PR is irrelevant, at least regarding the complete removal of the internal help.\n@sparerd What are you thought about opening the links for the website, donating, forum and bugs in an external browser instead of mremtoe itself though? I think this would still be a good thing to change.\nShould I provide a new PR?. - Always use Segoe UI; 9pt as a font\n- When needed to place alements next to each other leave enough space between them as translated strings might need more space.\n- Buttons should have the size of 100x24. I moved the reconnect button from the tab context menu to the first position. It felt a little off in the middle of the tab handling options:\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nAlso \"Disconnect Other Tabs\" only shows up when there are actually other tabs and\n\"Disconnect Tabs to the right\" only shows up when there are tabs to the right . Should I undo changing the icon position and make a new PR for this?. Closed, see #1229 . Looks like you guys need to hurry up with #1210 \ud83d\ude04\nBut jokes aside, the post build script copy_tiles.ps1 seems to run fine and copied three new files(mRemoteNG.VisualElementsManifest.xml, VisualElements_150.png and VisualElements_70.png) to\nC:\\jenkins\\workspace\\mRemoteNG_mRemoteNG_PR-1232-J7GRP7K5FOLRBMEQROZ7DM4HDRGCTSQHVTE6UVILEBRAJOIUJEDA\\mRemoteV1\\bin\\Debug\\, but at the end jenkins tries to look for it in C:\\jenkins\\workspace\\mRemoteNG_mRemoteNG_PR-1232-J7GRP7K5FOLRBMEQROZ7DM4HDRGCTSQHVTE6UVILEBRAJOIUJEDA\\mRemoteV1\\bin\\Release\\\nAny ideas? I don't think that's something I can fix with changing my code... f2669bb fixes #1235.  cbce572 fixes #1236. @kmscode Thanks a lot! Seems like VS regenerated the solution file when I made some changes and threw this line away.... Oh, I haven't thought about that. I have set the \"use small icons\"-option on my taskbar so I didn't think about the fact, that normally windows will display a 24x24 version of the icon here.\nDo you want to get rid of the pixelated version completely or should I provide the pixelated icon in multiple sizes like the normal one?. @sparerd I have removed the pixelated Icon - Tell me if you like this better.. I'll close the current PR #1229 and create a new one for this once the RemoveMagicLib branch is merged into develop.\nI'll use this issue for me to keep track of all the translating issues I notice. These are either missing/awkward german strings ore hardcoded non-translatable ones:\nSettings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfig\n\n\nToolstrip menus\n\n\nRight-click menus\n\n\nUpdate-popup\n\nClose tab prompt\n\n. yes, thats the same exception I get\n. you're absolutely tight with the components check. no idea how i missed that. >>when components check is run at startup the form is somehow wierdly docked which causes strange behavior later on.\n\nCould you clarify? I'm not seeing any issues with this...\n\n\nThe components page is loaded and docked into DPS, but no tab for it is visible.\n\n\n\nquick connect toolbar shows when connection is already active but doesn't bring it to front when clicked\n\nCould you clarify? I'm not aware of quick connect keeping connection states. Does this work differently in 1.76.12 or the develop branch?\n\n\n\n\n\njumping to messages/connection pane from view menu does not show the panes when dockstate is set to autohide\n\nDoes this work differently in 1.76.12 or the develop branch? I have a feeling that this is working the same way in those builds/branches. The notification panel was already using DPS (for quite some time) and this code wasn't modified off the top of my head...\n\nJust checked: It's the same behavior on the develop branch\n\n\n\nquick connect toolbar initiates connection as soon as the protocol is changed. (throws message wenn hostname is empty and does not allow to change protocol beforehand)\n\nThis is working as designed and has been this way for some time. In older builds, you would be prompted for the connection type. Reference #197\n\nIs this really working as designed? I would expect the two parts of the button to behave differently:\n\n - Clicking the left part should start a connection with the protocol that's set\n - Clicking the right part (just the arrow) allows to change protocol without starting the connection afterwards. @sparerd @kmscode If you want me to, I'll create a PR for this. @sparerd @kmscode Can implement this if you want me to. If I did not misunderstand you this  be already the case: Looks like this is the default behavior of DPS:\n\n. confirmed, only appears once . We do have ClickShare in our company - I'll try to take a look into this next week.. @Zenn1th \nI've been using mRemoteNG with ClickShare for almost an hour now and I haven't had any crashes yet.\nAre you sure you aren't doing anything special that could cause the crash or do you maybe have another software installed that might interfere with ClickShare?\nAlso please make sure that your base and the dongles are on the latest firmware. The ones I am using were updated yesterday a colleague told me.. @csveazey Can you please check if the \"minimize to notification area\" setting is checked?\n\nIf so, mrng does not actually closes but minimizes to your taskbar.. See #1320. Will propably be fixed with #1308. @jotatsu Could you maybe take a look at these?. Danke @auchri !. @sparerd Im good with it now. @sparerd all fixed. Isn't this the same file being shown on the about page inside mrng?. @sparerd That's a good idea, haven't had thought about that.\nI've added the favorites to the quick connect dropdown:\n. @Zewwy I cannot reproduce this. Running mrng off a unc path works fine for me.\nI have a little trouble understanding step 4 and 5.\nAs of my understanding you have a password protected connection file. After starting mrng it will prompt you for your password and as soon as you are confirming your password you are getting an RDP error message?\nAlso, what do you mean by \"the computer paths should remain unchanged\"?. @jonsbun The wiki entry on How to Help Translating mRemoteNG has been updated. Furthermore I just made a little gif to demonstrate the use of Zeta:\n\nOf course you don't need to open all language files. It's enough to open the language.resx plus any other language files that you want to work on.. Same as #1130. More info here.\n@turnleftatorion Feel free to reopen this if you need further support!\nClosing as this is not directly related to mRemoteNG.\n. Added it to the list.\nAlso nouns before verbs would be nice.\nSo this:\nstrConnectionOpen\nstrCoseConnection\nwould become this:\nConnectionOpen\nConnectionClose. Hi @mblissmer\nSince the last release of mrng a lot of things have changed. We have replaced the magiclib library with dockpanelsuite. As of the current develop branch the tabs look like this:\n\nSo there are no closing/arrow buttons on the far right side of the tabs anymore.\nFeel free to reopen this issue if you have any further questions/suggestions. . This icon will replace the old one: \n. Fixed with 5a226ff . @kmscode code-wise it looks ok but ui-wise it'll cause at least one problem:\n\nAlso do we really want these items to be in there?\n\nIt just seems so random to me. It's a mixture of menu items from different menus put together.\nIf we really want to have these options accessible from another place we should at least have a plan on when an item will be put there, too and when not.\nI don't think this would be a good idea, as it's redundant and irritating.\nSecondly the gear icons suggest that there are connection-related options stored there. It's the least place where I would look for an option to hide the main menu strip.. I would put an option like this into the windows application menu or whatever it's called:\n\nAlso this should be changed from an option to hide the main menu into an option to hide the whole menu strip container. Do we want this as the default behavior or as an optional feature that can be enabled via settings?. I have pulled your latest changes from the develop branch and included them in this branch. The unhandled exception should be gone now.. The Credentials page does not have an Icon in its resource file, neither do AppearancePage, ConnetionsPage or ThemePage. They seem to set their icon with PageIcon = Resources.Panels_Icon; in their own public method. What is the proper way to do this here? Should I add the Icons for each option page to their resource file or should they all set theit icon in the public constructor?. alright, on it. \nDas &-Zeichen macht den n\u00e4chsten Buchstaben zum Shortcut, f\u00fcr diejenigen die mit der Tastatur durch die Men\u00fcs navigieren.. erledigt..

    "aplocher": "This is a feature I've used for many years with mRemoteNG but it's a bit buried.  It might be worth keeping this task (or adding a new one) to update the UI/UX and encourage users to utilize this.  In fact, maybe even make it mandatory in order to save passwords.  Just a thought...\n. .NET Core is great, but the problem is it doesn't have any UI libraries.  With Xamarin I think you can build a single multi-platform UI but you will be limited to UWP (universal win platform / aka Store apps) for Windows. \nI believe with .NET Core you can reference old-school .NET assemblies System.Windows (WPF) or System.Windows.Forms (WinForms) then build that out separately for Windows, and use the Mono GTK implementation (whatever it's called) for Linux.  In this case, you would obviously need to maintain separate UI projects.\nUWP has definitely come a long way, but I still have a sour taste in my mouth when I use it.  Probably just bad memories of UWP's predecessor (WinRT).. Just my $0.02: the logo looks killer... loves me some flat styling.  \nSomething about the icon seems a little off, maybe the white background.  Might not be a bad idea to have two styles of the logo, one for dark backgrounds and one for light backgrounds, ~~and then perhaps use an ALMOST black background (e.g. #1c1c1c) for the icon (similar to the current icon, only keep it flat and stylized how you have it!)~~\nIn fact, to contradict my own previous statement, I don't think Windows design guidelines recommend using a background at all anymore.  Since tiles in the Start menu automagically (I think) provide a background color.  That might be a good reason to use your chunkier/bulkier 3D Icon (which looks killer, too, btw) with no background.\nAs you can see in this example, none of these icons are using backgrounds (with the exception, kinda, of Webstorm which has a stylized background [10th icon]): \n\nCheck out this link.  They actually have guidelines for shadowing on 3D Icons along with shadowing for Flat Icons (search page for \"Drop Shadow\")\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/vis-icons\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/app-assets\nOne more edit: might be worth pointing out too that once you get into smaller icon sizes like 24x24 and 16x16 you sometimes have to get extra creative with your design.  Your 3D is unlikely to look right at those smaller sizes, so perhaps keeping those ones flat with a background and some contrast that makes the \"MR\"  pop a little more would be good.  32x32 would maybe show the 3D appearance well - certainly anything higher than that will look great.  Since with ICO files you embed multiple sizes, I would suggest embedding both designs, depending on which size.  I could be just babbling now, though, you probably already knew that lol\n\n.

Do you use the portable version?\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/414 (scheduled for 1.76)\nhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/487. Duplicate? https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/761. I believe inheritance should be enabled when I select \"Inherit All\" on the root Connections.\nBut I should be able to disable it again on selected fields.. For example on the root Connections I set the default protocol RDP and Key Combination to yes.\nOn the first folder I disabled only username, password and domain from inheritance and configured them. And then all subfolders/hosts would inherit from the first folder which inherits its settings from the root Connections.\nIf I remember correct in an older version (1.72?) it was necessary to enable Inherit All on the root Connections, otherwise inheritance was not automatically set on the hosts and needed to be enabled always manually. Which was quite annoying.. I try to explain it on the screenshot.\nIn the past, I don't know when, the \"Inheritance\" button was available on Admin.\nNow it is not available on Admin only on subfolders.\n\n. The work around is working. Thank you.. Thanks @malfuncion \nI tried mRemoteNG-Portable-1.76.2.14965.zip right now. My issue from above is resolved but now default inheritance in the root connections is disabled which was enabled in the 1.75.\nNot a big issue for me but if you don't notice that it gets disabled during the update it can create some work afterwards.\nWhat I also noticed: the first start with my old confcons.xml took about 3 minutes with an unresponsive window, maybe a status window or a message box can indicate that mremote is doing something in the background (updating connection file?). . Default Inheritance on the root connection is disabled after going from 1.76.6 to 1.76.7.\n. Maybe a 64bit build?\nBut I have a workaround I use putty instead. So if you want close the ticket.. @kmscode the link you provided shows also a good workaround.\nWith C:\\Windows\\Sysnative I can launch the 64bit versions. Like C:\\Windows\\Sysnative\\cmd.exe or C:\\Windows\\Sysnative\\telnet.exe.\nIt's a bit hidden so maybe you can add it to the externals tools documentation.. Awesome. Thank you :-). Maybe somehow related https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/952. Is it related to https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/800?\nThis is fixed in 1.76 Alpha2. Maybe worth a try.. ",

    "SeethingSage": "I agree with this completely.  I used mRemote years ago, and I just tried mRemoteNG since I use a lot of RDP connections.  Not being able to select only some drives was the first thing I noticed.  I'm a network administrator.  I have tons of network drives.  When I RDP into servers on my own network, I already have those same drives present on the host server (auto-mapped via Group Policy).  The only other drive I want to connect back to is my local C drive (\\tsclient\\c).  I could turn of all drives via the connection, and then manually map back to my machine's C drive, but I don't want to have to do it each time, and I'd rather not leave it mapped persistently.  In native Remote Desktop, I can choose to bring over just that one drive, my C drive.\nIn mRemoteNG, turning on all drives means I then have all of the same mapped drives listed twice on the host machine.  That doesn't really affect the connection - but it seriously clutters up Windows Explorer.  However, if I RDP to a server across the WAN/Internet, I might still need my local C drive, but I certainly don't want ALL of my drives to be available in that case.  If I recall correctly, that can slow down the connection a lot.\nI realize the program supports other protocols, and seems to have some very nice features.  But for managing my RDP connections, this one simple non-feature is a deal breaker for me.  So I'll continue to just use native RDP for now.. ",
    "DennisT1": "FWIW I'd like to add my request for this enhancement.  If I'm connecting to a low bandwidth remote site I find myself reverting back to running RDP directly so I can limit to only one drive being shared.  I find Explorer to be quite slow when you have a lot of drives redirected and the connection is slow.\nBTW - Thanks for keeping this project alive.  I've been a fan since mRemote.. ",

I would really only want one or two of them connected. . I would also like this feature. I would use it exactly the same way as described above.. Without using the SQL stored procedure (above), and instead using the user interface, it would be nice if the Inherit All property on the Inheritance properties of the Configuration panel include an Auto option that would do the same as the SQL stored procedure (i.e., compare each existing property to the corresponding property of it's parent, and enable inheritance for that property if they match). .

Such as enabling a master password and setting the \"Encrypt entire file\" . Thank you for the excellent and clear information friend!\nJust to be absolutely clear; if the user does not set a password to open the application, a default key is used to encrypt the login credentials. The credentials are encrypted and based64 encoded and then written to disk. Is this correct?\nAlso, what\u2019s to stop me copying someone\u2019s .XML file and logging in as them?\nIt would be great to see a registry key or some other centrally controllable setting so that administrators can control the encryption behaviour.\nIntegration with password managers sounds like a excellent step!\nAgain, thanks for the information.\n\nFrom: David Sparer notifications@github.com\nSent: Monday, August 20, 2018 6:56 pm\nTo: mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG\nCc: Cranefield, Charlie; Author\nSubject: Re: [mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG] Secruity Review/Info ? (#1078)\nThe encryption process:\n\nUser provides the encryption key (the password used to open mRemoteNG) and the plain text that they wish to encrypt.\nThe user-provided encryption key and a randomly generated salt is run through the Pkcs5S2 key generation function a set number of times (determined by the Key Derivation Function Iterations option). The minimum number of iterations is 1000. The recommended iteration number is 5000 or greater. This step provides us a derived key.\nThe derived key and plain text are encrypted with the selected encryption engine/cipher mode.\nWe currently support 3 encryption engines: AES, Serpent, Twofish\nWe currently support 3 block cipher modes: GCM, CCM, EAX\n\n\nThe salt and encrypted data are combined and converted to Base64. This Base64 data is what is written to disk.\n\nA few further notes:\n\nBy default, only the password property of connection records are encrypted. This can be changed by enabling the Completely encrypt connection file option, which will encrypt the password field as normal, but then also encrypts the entire xml document (except the root xml node, which is required for decryption).\nBy default, a connection file will use a pre-configured encryption key. This is a legacy feature and is not secure at all. It is recommended that you set a custom password on all connection files. The pre-configured key feature is currently being phased out - you can follow the progress on this issue: #376https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/376.\nRelated to this, we are implementing a credential manager which will further separate connection details for sensitive credentials. The main goal of this is to let users import credentials from programs who are designed for credential management (KeePass, LastPass, PasswordSafe, etc). This feature has been delayed, but is still planned for release.

You obviously haven't worked in the industry professionally enough to know by now that there are people in high positions making decisions that they don't belong making. Like the one I pointed out above.  When those decisions start affecting your ability to do your job, then you have no choice but to find ways to work around the issues.\nI was in the middle of a upgrade for a sql server just yesterday to 2014. A colleague stopped by to pick my brain about a issue they where facing.  As I was turned around talking to him, the connection timed out and kicked me off killing the upgrade in the middle of the process. The installation was ruined, we had to restore the entire server from backups.  Did the GPO admins care? Nope.\nI'm not asking for it to be a keep it active forever feature. I'm asking for it to be like a timeout option we can choose, with a max setting of let's say a hour maybe.. The autohotkey does not solve the issue when you are on another app and mRemoteNG does not have focus. I use caffeine myself at home, and RDP still kicks in the lock screen with it.. Please see my comment above, you're preaching to the choir.\nYou can find out who made the decision all you want, in extremely large corporations your concern is not heard. Especially if they feel their decision is based on security concern they read from some trade journal.\nAnd as for management actually admitting to having any kind of error in their ways... hahahahaha, sell tickets for that show cause I'll be buying!.

He clearly states that what you are claiming is not in fact happening via mRemoteNG.\n\nSince you're talking about RDP I'm guessing you're talking about Windows machines. Windows does indeed allow spaces in usernames, if they are not at the end or beginning, and these are not trimmed off by mRemoteNG.\n. I can do a pull request and make the needed modification.

I merely select a folder, choose export as file, choose csv, unselect user info options, and export. Gives me an error when trying to import that csv just created.\n. Well crap, I tried it today and am not able to reproduce it either.\n\nComparing the \"bad\" CSV to the one I just tested that works now. These are the columns that were missing in the \"bad\" CSV. The Username, Password, Domain is expected to be missing, as I unselected those from the list of what to export. And there is a extra Folder field in the \"bad\" csv.\n\nId\nParent\nNodeType\nUsername\nPassword\nDomain\nInheritRDPAlertIdleTimeout\nInheritRDPMinutesToIdleTimeout\nInheritSoundQuality.\n\nAlso, my script that builds a CSV file for me to import into MR. It outputs all fields with quoted text qualifiers. What library are you using to read the import CSV? Can we change it to one that is more CSV standard friendly, like CsvHelper?\nWhen I try to import with a CSV with text qualifiers mRemoteNG gives me an error. So I have to open up the CSV in notepad and delete all the quotes that are text qualifiers. PowerShell's CSV-Export has no capability to tell it to not use text qualifiers..

    "lars18th": "Hi @sparerd ,\nI feel you misunderstood my proposal. Let me to explain more:\n\nI'm not suggesting to connect with RDP using SSH.\nI'm suggesting that the TCP connection to an RDP server is done using a PROXY.\nI'm suggesting that the proxy support includes SOCKS and HTTP-CONNECT protocols.\n\nMy goal (and not the only use of the proxy support) is:\n1) I connect to one SSH server in the same network as the RDP server is running.\n2) In this SSH connection I enable one \"Dynamic Tunnel\", it's say \"a socks4a server listenning on the local loopback of the client\".\n3) Then, after all done... using any SSH client independent of the RDP connection, I open the mRemoteNG and I select my RDP connection, that is done through the proxy.\nSo, add support for proxies in RDP connections is independent of SSH.\nI think it's easy to implement. And I hope the developers accept to incorporate this functionality.\nRegards.\n. Hi,\nIn a second pass...\nYou don't need at all a library for RDP with proxy support (this doesn't exist!).\nYou need to use a library for PROXY connection, or directly implement it in the code. Let me explain how to:\n\nIf you use regular RDP connection, use the mstsclib as normal.\nIf you use proxied RDP connection, do:\nOpen the TCP connection using the proxy with these parameters:\nIP destination: address of the proxy\nPORT destination: port of the proxy\nRemote IP: address of the RDP server\nRemote PORT: 3389 or the alternative RDP port\nLocal PORT: random listening TCP port\n\n\nAfter the TCP is stablished call the mstsclib using as target: 127.0.0.1:local-PORT\n\nThat's all! RDP over TCP tunnels are trivial, and we use it for years.\nAnother option, if the mstsclib supports to pass the TCP socket handle, it's to use the socket provided by the proxy library.\nI hope you get it now!. Hi @JarRoDk ,\nI feel I don't explain well. Let me try another time:\n\nThe RDP protocol use by default TCP (only in recent versions of the protocol the UDP transport is also optionally accepted).\nWith ANY service that uses TCP is possible to use TCP tunnels.\nIn order to tunnel one RDP connection over a TCP connection you need to use as target the tunnel address:port, instead of the remote address:port.\n\nSo, for tunneling one RDP connection over a SOCKS proxy, the client only needs to do two actions:\n1) Create the tunnel using the SOCKS protocol. The tunnel has this info:\n - Target: Remote RDP server address:port\n - Source: Local machine (address:port)\n2) Connect using the RDP client (mstc.exe, or any other) to the address:port of the tunnel.\nIt's very easy, as the for client the address:port can be any. So the requested new functionality is targeting only the UI to configure the tunnel, and the previous task to stablish the tunnel.\nYou don't need special RDP clients, or proxyfier tools, to use RDP over TCP tunnels.\nThe mRemoteNG tool only needs to add support for proxy SOCKS.\n. HI @JarRoDk .\n\nIf mstc.exe can use socks proxing like other mature software ; ] it would be any problems.\n\nMy request is because mstc.exe don't have support for PROXY.\nHowever, it's very simple to add support for it (and other tools) inside mRemoteNG:\n- The UI needs to add the space for specify the proxy server.\n- The internal code requires to have the function to stablish the tunnel before run the tool (mstc.exe).\n- After stablish the tunnel, just do run the tool (mstc.exe) with the address:ip of the tunnel (not the remote server).\nThis could be used with any tool. It's only required to add the functions to stablish the tunnel using a SOCKS PROXY.\nYou like one example? Review the WinSCP tool. It has support for PROXY connections and \"Connect throught SSH tunnel\".\nThis request is only to \"automatize\" the management of the tunnel. For sure you can do it manually!. No!\nAt time no one has implemented this functionality. So I'm still using the 2X/Parallels Client for my RDP connections.. > I use it to proxy RDP connections via SSH in another app similar to mRemoteNG\nHi dgcom,\nYes, you can do it manually. And you have a lot of options. For example, a simple SSH tunnel is a very simple way. However, with a large list of RDP servers and with one Proxy, it will be more powerfull to have this functionality implemented.\nI hope that soon the developers of the mRemoteNG will agree with the inclusion of the Proxy support. :smile: . Hi,\nIn my opinion this function is a must have!\nWhy?\n\nAny RDP connection can work over a TCP tunnel. So it doesn't disturbs the client or the server.\nA lot of IT professionals use remote SSH connections to accesing to secure networks, instead of a complex VPN solutions. In these environments a RDP client with socks proxy client support is a huge advantage.\nAdd support for tunneled conections is quite easy when including some proxy client library. The algoritm is then trivial: stablish the tunnel using the PROXY data and the RDP SERVER data, and after the tunnel is OK then connect to the TUNNEL data. No more, no less.\n\nSo, the summary is: why no one works on it? :cry: . Hi @sparerd ,\nGreat to hear that you found this functionality interesting. From my point of view is sufficient to add it to the official TODO list. So, at some point someone will implement it.\nThank you for your efffort!. Hi @st-schuler ,\n\nI'm going to implement this now.\n\nGreat to hear it!\nHowever, please don't forget the pure PROXY support! Your idea is about use SSH tunnels, and it's amazing. But, PROXY support is a different (but complementary) functionality. For example, with an HTTP proxy you use a tunnel over a TCP connection with the HTTP CONNECT command. With a SOCKS proxy you ask to the server for a TCP tunnel.\nSo, I recommend not only to add support for \"SSH gateways\" but too for \"HTTP proxies\" and \"SOCKS proxies\".\nYou will do?. Hi @st-schuler ,\n\nCurrently I will only implement ssh-tunnel/gateway. Proxy is then another thing, but shouldn't be that difficult\n\nSorry, but my original request (see the title of this issue) is about the PROXY support. The SSH-TUNNEL/GATEWAY is another different functionality. I agree with it, however it's more complex to implement. And in the other hand, less usefull... why? You can do the tunnel manually (you only need to configure your SSH client), but what about the PROXY support? With the current implemention is impossible to stablish the connection using a PROXY (HTTP, SOCKS, etc.).\nPlease, reconsider the priorities. I feel PROXY has more priority than SSH-TUNNEL/GATEWAY.\nDon't you think?\nIn any case: Thank you for your work. I only comment this as my personal point of view. Everything you implement is welcome! :wink: \nRegards.. Hi,\nIs anyone working on the implementation of this?\nPlease note that at time the VNC client has support for HTTP and SOCKS proxies.\nSee: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/blob/05c96da98f475e6152418632d8259e34d73a51ee/mRemoteV1/Connection/Protocol/VNC/VNCEnum.cs#L52\nMy request is only to implement the same support for the RDP client!\nAnd this seems to be quite easy as the VNC proxy code can be reused. The VNC connection is a TCP socket, so the proxy is transparent. And the RDP protocol uses a TCP connection too. So the implementation is identical.\nPlease, after a year and a half of the original request, and several users requesting it, I suggest to improve the priority of this request.\nYou agree? :wink: . Oh, sorry @sparerd !\nIn any case, I suggest to include (at some time) an abstract base \"proxy\" connection for all procotols that use TCP sockets.\nYou agree?. Hi @sparerd ,\nGreat to hear you aggree with my suggestion!\nAbout the KiTTY and PuTTY use together:\n\nYou can use both at the same time, if you like. So can be used together.\nKiTTY has options (from commandline) for import and export to the PuTTY registry. You can consider to use it if you need it.\nAs KiTTY isn't the only PuTTY fork, I suggest to leave the user TWO config paths: one for the preferable SSH client using the registry and stock PuTTY entries; and another for the preferable portable SSH client, in this case with the path for the config file/directory. So, when running mRemoteNG in PORTABLE mode you will use the portable SSH client.\n\nI hope you can include this suggestion in the roadmap.\nThank you!\n. Hi,\nThis is already requested and planned: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/420\nSo please, close this issue.. ",
    "JarRoDk": "I also very often use dynamic tunnel in putty. For example for Firefox to use socks connections. \nThe biggest advantage in dynamic tunneling is that i don't need specify target connection. \nAs you mentioned RDP don't have by default this feature so it is hard to force to use socks especially on windows. I searched software which will put on RDP rule that every connection from mstsc.exe should go throw socks or if software discovery flow to specific network. ProxyCap, Proxyfier, MobaXterm can do it but, can't find any free solution ( maybe someone correct me ). \nI think this feature will be very cool. .

The following parameters are defined:\n- name\n- description\n- hostname\n- port\n- username\n- password\nEach connection/folder now has a new property which can be used to select one of the previously defined SSH gateways via dropdown box. If the connection is activated, the SSH tunnel is established first.\nAn SSH gateway can be used by several connections at the same time. \nThe first one establishes the connection, with each further one only a new port forwarding is set up.\n. SSH keys are also supported.\nCurrently I will only implement ssh-tunnel/gateway. Proxy is then another thing, but shouldn't be that difficult.. ",

It would probably include functionality that allows the selected session entry to remain selected even during a DB refresh. That would probably take care of the issue.. I had the same issue. Found this thread, downloaded and installed 1.75.7011, and the issue is no longer...\nThanks for the quick fix!!\nPS - It also seems to have solved another (possibly related) issue where mRemote wouldn't load the contents of connection files I attempted to open.

    "paraworlds2": "This would be an extremely helpful feature for our organization.\nHere is an example of launching notepad when and rdp file is launched in Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. These two lines were added to the RDP file when I created it using the Server 2003 Remote Desktop Connection. However, this has changed in later versions, since I don't see the Programs tab anymore in windows 10 and it doesn't work with my Server 2016, though this did work in windows server 2003 and will work with RemoteApps in 2012/2016. That being said, Remote Desktop Connection Manager v2.7 (RDMan) has this feature as well and it does work in those same two instances: 1. connecting to Windows Server 2003 and 2. connecting to Windows 2012/2016 that is set up with RDSH with the application you're trying to launch listed in the allowed applications (RemoteApp Programs). In RDMan, you go to the properties of a server and go to the \"Connection Settings\" tab and the settings are there for Start Program, Working dir, etc. Since we do have RDSH set up, this would work for us but it would need to be added to mRemoteNG as an option. Here are the two lines in the rdp that mRemoteNG would need to support for 2003 servers.\nalternate shell:s:\nshell working directory:s:\nEXAMPLE:\nalternate shell:s:c:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe\nshell working directory:s:c:\\windows\\system32\n\nFor Server 2016, it actually uses the following fields\nremoteapplicationmode:i:1\nremoteapplicationprogram:s:C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe\nremoteapplicationcmdline:s:%HOMEPATH%\\Test.txt\nFor Windows 2012/2016 to work with RemoteApps, it actually uses the following lines in the .rdp file.

Very similar to how you can edit the shell in the Registry of Windows to create custom context menu items when you right-click on the Windows desktop.\nThis may be a request specific to my needs though and the way I'm using the tool, but I think it would definitely help improve the UI.. I would say option 2 would be the quickest and easiest way to do this.  I'm sure I could think of ways to utilize a second layer, but starting with a single category to group them by would be sufficient enough.  Then as you said anything not in a group would sit at the top level.\nThis link is basically what I was referring to in my last post: https://www.howtogeek.com/107965/how-to-add-any-application-shortcut-to-windows-explorers-context-menu/\nCascading Menus, that was the term I was looking for :)\n. Ideally though, it would be nice to just be able to browse to an .exe and grab the associated icon automatically rather than having to manually add icons.

Thanks @sparerd \nJust having the vnc improvement on your todo list is comforting.. Alright, let me see if I can clarify this a bit more, since I do experience this minor annoyance.\nSay you have two SSH connections on your connections list.\nDouble-click one to open up a session, then without clicking anywhere else, double-click a second connection to open up a session with the second connection.  The second double-click will not open up the session, but instead give you rename of the second connection setting's name.. That is strange.\nI've tested with brand new mRemoteNG, and still got same results by setting up some dummy ssh connections.\nSo it must be some external environment related, and no, it's not my mouse/finger/doubleclick speed issue.\nI'm very certain I performed my consecutive double clicking maneuver correctly.... : )\nHere's another hint.

I do like the sound of that method though :D\nAlthough, I would propose more flexibility in separating creds from connection info, as some of my situations there's many different creds to manage, and root creds wouldn't be flexible enough for me, but a central store of connection config info would be super rad!. Is the SQL central storage method still considered Beta/Devel? The wiki page and other parts in the app seem to suggest yes. Pretty sweet feature, but is it just MS SQL that it works with? What about MySQL/MariaDB/ProstgreSQL?. Well, any chance we could get a gui display to do this?

In order to use this feature, I have to select each session/folder and change the inheritance for this feature to Yes.

We could maybe just display a \"Connection is closed\" message in that panel instead of immediately closing it.

Ok, found a v1.72 install om my old laptop.

Which option is that? I cannot find it.\nAnd I hope the part about VNC versions gets fixed somehow in the next 1.75 of 1.76 version.. ",

Wow, David, you\u2019re absolutely right. It worked.\nFrom an admin\u2019s perspective, CredSSP\u2019s purpose in life is Single Sign-On, so the user doesn\u2019t have to log on to the RD session. For that to work, the RDSH and the client have to be members of the same domain, because the client passes the user\u2019s logon credentials to the RDSH, which then has to have its DC authenticate them. So I would not have thought it needed to be turned on.\nIn fact, by default, CredSSP is DISABLED on RDSH\u2019s. It requires a registry edit or GPO to enable. That makes it even more surprising that this would make any difference. But maybe what\u2019s disabled on the server is the auth piece and not the protocol piece.\nSo, problem solved, and I learned something.\nMaybe I disabled CredSSP at the same time as I did the upgrade. And then when I did the clean install, it was either off by default or I turned it off. Too many weeks have gone by to know, now.\nThanks!\n--\nJeff Vandervoort\nCrescent IT Systems\nFrom: David Sparer [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Wednesday, February 14, 2018 4:17 PM\nTo: mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG mRemoteNG@noreply.github.com\nCc: Jeff Vandervoort jvandervoort@crescent-systems.com; Author author@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG] NLA error 2825 (#875)\nI would recommend attempting a connection from mRemoteNG with CredSSP turned on. According to the CredSSP protocol specification, the client and sever do not need to be on the same domain for the protocol to work. All it does is provide a TLS connection during authentication and help with selecting an authentication protocol that both hosts support.\nI admit it seems odd that this issue cropped up after updating mremoteng though.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/875#issuecomment-365763193, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AiVu_I1la_cSwq_ALCObcaj5mvLqlRi1ks5tU1tDgaJpZM4R0VgX.\n. David, it\u2019s more than an error message problem. NLA and CredSSP are two different things.\nI\u2019m a little rusty now, but RDS was my life a few years ago, and I still support a small RDS infrastructure for one of my clients.\nNLA is the feature that prompts for credentials on the client instead of using the GINA on the server. It functions whether you\u2019re passing creds from Windows (CredSSP), using stored creds from mRemoteNG, or typing them. MSTSC requests NLA unless otherwise set in a custom RDP file, and if the RDSH accepts (or requires) NLA, is capable of using it. If the RDSH doesn\u2019t accept NLA, MSTSC falls back to using the RDSH\u2019s GINA for authentication.\nCredSSP uses NLA to pass credentials from Windows and won\u2019t function without NLA. CredSSP is disabled by default in MSTSC, and if you want to use it, it must be enabled through a custom RDP file. It\u2019s most often used for RemoteApps in order to provide a UX similar to running a program locally. CredSSP falls back to prompting for credentials if Windows credentials don\u2019t work.\nI don\u2019t have visibility into what\u2019s happening under the hood. But empirically, it looks like \u201cUse CredSSP\u201d in mRemoteNG is enabling/disabling client-side NLA AND client-side CredSSP. It should only be enabling/disabling CredSSP. To duplicate functionality of MSTSC v6+, there should NEVER be a time when mRemoteNG, can\u2019t authenticate by NLA if the RDSH supports it, regardless of the \u201cUse CredSSP\u201d setting. With \u201cUse CredSSP\u201d turned on, Windows is ALSO trying to log on with local creds, but that\u2019s harmless. If Windows creds fail, NLA will fall back to mRemoteNG creds, and finally, the credential prompt. We shouldn\u2019t HAVE to enable it to use mRemoteNG, but it won\u2019t hurt anything if we do.\nHTH\n--\nJeff Vandervoort\nCrescent IT Systems\nFrom: David Sparer [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Wednesday, February 14, 2018 5:21 PM\nTo: mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG mRemoteNG@noreply.github.com\nCc: Jeff Vandervoort jvandervoort@crescent-systems.com; Author author@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG] NLA error 2825 (#875)\nGlad to hear that worked for both of you.

Cool, thanks, David.\nI need to also mention that I\u2019m really glad I found mRemoteNG. It provides the functionality of the commercial RD manager I used years ago, can\u2019t recall the name of it any more. Especially the External Tools feature I use almost as much as RDS. But mRemoteNG is available at my favorite price!\nI love that it scales the Remote Desktop for my Surface Pro hi-res display automatically. That\u2019s what initially drew me to it. When I got my Surface Pro, I couldn\u2019t see the servers I was working on any more with MSTSC without manually scaling, or RDCMAN which has no scaling at all.\nSpeaking of scaling\u2026any thought of creating a RemoteApp client instead of using MSTSC.EXE? RemoteApps on hi-res displays have no scaling provisions at all, even manually, and are pretty much unusable. At least against WS2012 RDSH\u2019s. I think I read MS has done better with scaling on WS2016 but don\u2019t have experience with it.

The connection inherit from the system type folder, which then inherits from the SVC Account 1 and 2 folders above. In previous versions, this worked. With last update, no longer pushes down the tree. Noticed that I can set inheritance on the connection level and it works for that sessions only. Once I close the GUI and reload it is reverted on startup to \"false\" in the confCons.xml. Shutdown keeps the flags to \"true\". I also see an error about cannot load \"donotplay\" for object referring to sound passthrough. Possibly related, but not sure? \nedit- rereading the initial issue, the request is actually asking for an option to push inheritance DOWN instead of enabling inheritance and pulling from above. I will log this under a different issue, however I agree this feature request would be nice. . Fixed with version 1.76.2.14923. XML case sensitivity fix seemed to have resolved this issue. .

Following problems and suggestions were found:\nFunctionality problems\nUnsorted:\n- [x] Hotkeys for new folder and new connection stop working if File menu was called when PuTTy Saved Sessions was selected;\n- [x] Also it's possible to create new element inside PuTTy Saved Sessions - you have to create new folder in root element, then delete it - PuTTy node will be active (but, I guess, not focused), and it'll be possible to create new node inside it through hotkey.\n8 (Rename Folder):\n- [x] HotKeys stop working and stop being shown in right click menu if F2, Ctrl + N or Ctrl + Shift + N is pressed on PuTTy Saved Sessions node or any node inside it.\n9 (Duplicate): \n- [x] Duplicating root or PuTTy node through hotkey causes unhandled exception.\n10 (Import). All problems are in  Port Scan functionality:\n- [x] Can't move through octets of IPs by arrows or Tab;\n- [x] Stop button does nothing - Scan goes until completion;\n- [ ] Ports range also does nothing - if I'll point out, for instance, from 3389 to 3389, I still see other ports in Closed or Open ports;\n- [x] Can't sort results;\n- [x] Why Protocol to import is needed? If I'll choose RDP, it still imports only the selected node from the list, not all where RDP is available;\n- [x] If I choose single node and do the import through Import button at the lower right corner, Port Scan tab is closed. Reopening it crashes the app;\n- [x] If I try to import several nodes through Import button at the lower right corner, I get unhandled exception immediately,\n11 (Export to file)\n- [ ] If I'm choosing export while folder is selected, Export menu opens with Export everything option. Same for connection export. I think the option should be Export selected folder or Export selected connection, respectively;\n- [ ] Why File name section is needed at all? User automatically thinks that he already made an export by pressing Save in Save As dialog. I suggest to remove this section and replace OK button to Export.\n- [x] There's no check for Assigned Credentials flag\n- [x] Assigned Credential means \"password only\" - login is still being exported. May be you should rename this flag;\n- [ ] Ctrl + E is a good combination for Export function ;)\nAcceptance testing guide\n5 (Save Connection File testing): \n\n[ ] Changes persist after restart even if I don't save connection file. May be some steps are missed here? Or may be it's better to check if modify date is changed after saving the file?\n\n7 (Delete):\n- [ ] i-iv: hotkey for deletion should be tested too.\n- [ ] v.a: not very significant, but root node name depends on locale (in Russian it's called \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f and so on);\n- [ ] v-vi: hotkey for deletion should be tested too, but in this case no actions is expected;\n- [ ] 12 (Exit): Hotkey testing?. 1.76.4.16229 - tested View Menu section on Windows 7 x64 SP1 with .NET Framework 4.7.1. The results are:\n1 (Add Connection Panel)\n\n[x] If only one panel is opened, it can't be closed through x button. GIF that shows it.\n\n7 (Jump To)\n\n[ ] It would be nice to add Quick Connections to Jump To menu, hotkey - Ctr+Alt+Q.\n\n8 (Reset Layout)\n- [ ] Resetting the layout doesn't affect toolbars and External Tools windows. I guess this is as designed, although I'm not sure about exttools...\nAlso there's some \"out-of-order\" bugs concerning localization:\n\n\n[x] Whenever themes are enabled or not (GIF):\n\n\nSwitching language still leaves some interface elements from home locale. In my case Russian text is present in context menus when English locale is enabled:\n\n[x] When themes are enabled, there are several bugs in Russian locale (GIF):\nWhen app is started with russian locale, opening Options switches menu toolbar (but none of it's sections contents) to English;\n\nIf Options window is closed on Connections tab, opening Options again causes unhandled exception\n(Exception.txt).\n\n\n[x] Also in Russian locale there's English text in Notification, Theme and Security tabs, but I guess it's just lack of translation. @sparerd , thank you for the app :) Another \"out-of-order\" bug concerning Connections tree panel: \n\n\n[x] Hotkeys stop working and disappear from the menu if I'll do the folowing steps:\n\nRight click on the node to call context menu;\nLeft click on the same node to close menu.\n\nGIF that shows it. After this steps hotkeys stop working immediately. Bug doesn't reproduce if the left click will be on the other node or the right click will be done on the same node\n. 1.76.4.16229 - tested Tools and Help menus section on Windows 7 x64 SP1 with .NET Framework 4.7.1:\nFunctionality problems\nTools Menu\nNo problems.\nHelp Menu\n\n[ ] 2-5 (Websites). It's better to open links in default browser instead of mRNG tab that uses IE. Moreover, Report a Bug opens GitHub that says that browser is no longer supported;\n[ ] 7 (Check for updates). I suggest to also show update channel that is selected in options;\n[ ] 8 (About). Some text is hard to see in dark themes.\n\nAcceptance testing guide issues\nHelp Menu\n\n[x] 6 (Announcements). There's no Announcements button at all;\n[x] 7.i. What is considered the correct version? On the website I see Prerelease v1.76 Alpha 6, which doesn't equal to 1.76.4.16229. I suggest to use version from  OS Uninstall or change a program window;\n[ ] 7.ii. Same question, although I don't know what to use as correct version.\n\nP.S.: I started to mark lists as checklists. Tell me if I shouldn't do so. 1.76.4.16229 - tested Toolbars section on Windows 10 LTSB 2016 with .NET Framework 4.7.1.

The results are:\nGUI problems\n- [ ] In dark themes, when toolbars aren't locked, it's hard to see their anchors;\n- [ ] In dark themes, can't see buttons in the list of connections and drop-down menus in World icon;\n- [ ] When list of connections is too tall, can't scroll through it using mouse wheel.\nFunctionality problems\n\n[x] 2.i. If something is entered in address field, changing protocol already opens connection. I guess that connection should start only when I press the button with protocol name;\n[x] 2.iii. Caught an exception, presumably when I've choose connection from history and changed its type. I couldn't reproduce it.\n\nAcceptance testing guide\n\n[x] 2.iv (Quick connect world icon). I guess that 2.v-viii are subitems of 2.iv, so 2.iv should be 3, and 2.v-viii - 3.i-iv;\n[x] 3.i (External Tools Toolbar). By default, there will be no tools, so steps for adding them should be first. 1.76.4.16229 - tested Button Menu and Renaming tree items on Windows 7 x64 SP1 and .NET Framework 4.7.1:\n\nFunctionality problems\nButton Menu\n\n[x] 3.i (View). Catched #993.\n\nRenaming tree items\n\n[ ] 1.i.c (Context menu). Strange, but English name isn't bolded in root node config. Not reproduced when renaming through Config pane;\n[ ] 1.ii.c (Config panel rename). Root node changes name in Connections only after mouse hover;\n[ ] 2.i.a (PuTTy hover-rename). If by \"hover-rename\" you mean selecting node and clicking on it once again, then it's not working at all. I guess this is connected with \"Right click - Left click - No hotkeys\" problem;\n[ ] 2.iii.a (PuTTy Config panel rename). Name property is not read-only, and I can change it. Name comes back to default after restart.\n\nAcceptance guide\nButton Menu\n- [x] 4.ii (Sort Descending). Need to point out that in this case sorting is called through context menu (or just make a button :)).\nRenaming tree items\n- [x] Hover-rename check appears only in the end, for PuTTy Saved Sessions. 1.76.4.16229 - tested Moving tree items section on Windows 7 x64 SP1 with .NET Framework 4.7.1:\nNo functionality problems.\nAcceptance testing guide\n\n[x] 1.iv (Drag a folder onto a connection). If I move the folder onto a connection, nothing happens. I guess I should drag folder between connections or connection and its containing folder;\n[x] 1.v (Drag a folder onto itself). \"Cannot drag node onto itself\" message should be checked as well;\n[x] 1.vi (Drag a folder onto one of its children). \"Cannot drag parent node onto child\" message should be checked as well + same as for 1.iv;\n[x] 2.ii (Drag a connection onto another connection). Same as for 1.iv;\n[x] 3.i (Root node).\"This node is not draggable\" message should be checked as well;\n[x] 4,5 (PuTTy). Same as for 3.i\n\n\nSelecting \"RDP\" will import all selected scan results as connections with a protocol set to RDP\n\nStrange logic. If I select 10 connections with SSH protocol on half of them, what's the point of importing them as RDP connections? IMHO importing only the connections that contain selected protocol is better. 1.76.4.16229 - reproduced even without filtering: the problem is in Expand all folders button. Not quite well, but I'll better make another request for it. If I'm not mistaken, option 1 equals to removing Full Screen mode at all.\nIf option 2 will make window like the one in Chrome then it's pretty fine. ",

Doh!  I should search better, just found this, #1071. I've been thinking about this some more.  Maybe we don't need to hide the connection tabs as these can be useful.  Maybe what is needed is to select the connection in the connection tree when the tab is changed meaning that the highlighted connection tree item will always match the selected tab?\nThis might be a better solution (and easier to implement?). @sparerd I've implemented a change for this improvement, but I have no idea if the code is up to your standards or not.  This is my first git commit/push, whatever they call it!. @sparerd is there anything on this that I still need to action?. @sparerd thanks.  Not to worry about it becoming redundant, as actually, I probably wanted this behaviour because the tree list wasn't tracking the selected tab properly, and that I was tending to use the tree view as a way of figuring out what connection I was looking at.

I haven't used either programmatically in a while (just front end access) - I don't know/recall if there will be any differences in accessing MariaDB as it's a more open fork of MySQL. Did you research/review this at all? If so, do you expect that your changes would support MariaDB as well?\n\nActually, the DB I'm using is MariaDB - everything works with it at present....!

Whichever of these I choose, I get the message popping up the next time mRemote is run.. Right, I think I see what's happening - I've installed the 1.76 upgrade on top of where the 1.75 version was - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\mRemoteNG - and am re-using the same shortcut to run it as I did before - but the shortcut does not seem to be set to \"run as administrator\", which it would probably need to be, in order to write files in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\mRemoteNG. My 1.75 version didn't need to because all its files were written to my profile, which doesn't need admin rights.\nI am also wondering whether I have have somehow upgraded from an install version, to a portable version - hence, the portable version might not be expecting to run from within C:\\Program Files (x86). So perhaps to really clear things up, a full uninstall and reinstall of an install (non-portable) version might be a good idea.... ",

There seems to be a wider issue with windows 10 installing programs.\nFYI The workaround was to install mremoteng via the command line as per this article. \nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Run-Exe-from-Cmd-on-PC-or-Mac\nI suspect MS wil release a fix at some point.\nThanks for all your help. I am just glad that I can now install and use mremoteng. Its a great application\n. ",

Using the original MSI\n\nIf you have access to the original MSI used for the installation, you\n   can simply right click it in Windows Explorerand select Uninstall.\nAs stated above you can do the same by command line: msiexec /x\n   filename.msi /q\n\nJSI : => I don't have it anymore unfortunately\n\n\nUsing the ARP (Add/Remove Programs) Applet\n\n\nJust got to mention the normal approach though it is obvious\n\nGo start -> run -> appwiz.cpl -> ENTER in order to open the add/remove\n   programs applet (or click add/ remove programs in the control panel)\nClick \"Remove\" for the product you want to uninstall.\n\nJSI : => Doesn't work of course.\n\n\n\nUsing msiexec.exe command line\n\n\nYou can locate the required GUID to pass to msiexec.exe /x by\n   opening regedit.exe at\n   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall and\n   search for the application name (or just browse through each sub folder\n   till u find it).\n\nWhen you have found it you can pass it to msiexec as explained\nabove: msiexec.exe\n   /x {0077A7C7-3333-2222-1111-111111111000}\nMore information on this serverfault.com post\n   http://serverfault.com/a/274673/20599 and this stackoverflow post\n   http://stackoverflow.com/a/21502621/129130\n\nNB: These registry paths are not up to date for 64-bit windows. I will\nupdate as soon as I can verify, or someone else update it please.\n\n\n\nUsing the cached MSI database in the super hidden cache folder\n\n\nMSI strips out all cabs (older Windows versions) and caches each MSI\n   installed in a super hidden system folder at %SystemRoot%\\Installer (you\n   need to show hidden files to see it).\n\nAll the MSI files here will have a random name assigned, but you can\n   get information about each MSI by showing the Windows Explorer status bar\n   (View -> Status Bar) and then selecting an MSI. The summary stream from the\n   MSI will be visible at the bottom of the Windows Explorer window. Or as\n   Christopher Galpin points out, turn on the \"Comments\" column in Windows\n   Explorer and select the MSI file.\nOnce you find the right MSI, just right click it and go Uninstall.\n\nJSI : => thanks for the tips but I couldn't find it there.\nNB: This supper hidden folder is now being treated differently in Windows\n7 onwards. MSI files are now cached full-size\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/1189524/129130.
