    "jescalan": "Good call, thanks! Totally missed that one\n. Interesting, had never thought of this or used it. Yeah we could definitely switch this over to using web intents. The only thing that bothers me about it is loading twitter's widget external javascript. I wanted to try to load as few external deps as possible to keep this quick and light. But either way the option should definitely be there.\nIf you'd like, feel free to take a crack at this and send in a pull request - the code is fairly simple and there are build and contribution instructions in the readme. If not, I'll see about getting this in sometime this week.\nEdit: Twitter's script is quite heavy...\n. Closing due to inactivity\n. Ah, great catch. I'll take a look at this and see if there's a fix we can get in here that's somewhat elegant :thumbsup: \n. There are instructions provided here for contributing and how to run the grunt compiler :smile: \nEDIT: Oh, the styles thats right. Yeah that's a weird thing, I should probably have a script that handles that as well. Yeah for now it's manual compile and paste like you mentioned, but note that it's something of a template, so you need to also keep those template values. All in all, this process is not very reasonable though, I'll try to integrate it in with the grunt task.\n. Hey @austinpray - finally got around to redoing the build script so that it's easier to contribute to the styles. Now the stylus file in the src folder will be automatically compiled into the script when you run cake build. Hope this makes life easier, and let me know if you figure out the 1 pixel glitch!\n. Hope so! I also just added a watch task, so you can run cake watch and hack away at it, just refreshing to see changes\n. @q2amarket your comment seems to obviously be a troll, I'm going to delete it unless you'd like to edit to clarify or remove it yourself. You have one day to respond.\n. @q2amarket  It's not a fix for the problem, and would make everything yellow on hover which makes no sense\n. Closing due to inactivity and because this is a chrome bug rather than a share-button issue. If anyone still wants to fix this, you are welcome to!\n. Ok, figured out the cause of this - it's the pointer :after element interfering. It can be fixed by setting the lis z-index. I'll put in a patch for this soon : )\n. This was patched up in the latest release :smile: \n. Ok let's try to break this down. You seem to be reporting three things here:\n1. It doesn't work in chrome\nYou need to provide more details on how to replicate the issues you are having. I tested and there are no issues in chrome that I can see, so it might be something specific to your computer. Have you tried opening it in a clean install of chrome, in an incognito window?\n2. Can you add the many buttons\nI'm not sure I could make any sense of this request, perhaps there's a different way you could word this?\n3. Could you make the menu appear vertically?\nNo, but if you would like to fork it and modify the styles to have the menu appear vertically, you are welcome to do so.\n. 1. Since it works in incognito, this means it's almost certainly one of your chrome extensions that's messing it up. Try disabling a couple extensions and see if that helps.\n2. If you have suggestions for other services, open to hearing them, and this is an open source project so we're open to contributions. The reason we chose those three is because they are the most common, and we were aiming for simplicity.\n. Closing this issue as it is certainly invalid. If you have any more questions @MajidCS feel free to ask and I'll try to help, but I'm not going to leave this issue open.\n. So the ul is actually scoped under the .share-button class (or whatever class you override it with in the options) at the moment, but as a descendent selector. If you define a set of universal ul styles, there's not much we can do to prevent it from leaking in, other than attempting to clear any other style on it.\nThat being said, I have seen leaking ul and li styles in peoples' implementations, and I wonder if there is a simple way to resolve this that doesnt make the semantics suffer. I mean technically I think the best way to handle it would be to remove ul and li and make everything divs, as more or less nobody would define universal div styles. But technically that is less semantic...\n. Feel free to add these if you'd like - jump right into the source and make a pull request. Everything is documented as clearly as possible!\n. Hey @proclamo - I just cloned this down fresh and tried to replicate your issue but I have not been able to. Did you run npm install before building? Did you see any errors come up during build?\n. Just pushed a fix for the autoprefixer piece, try again and see if that fixes it (remove node_modules and run npm i again). Copying the string from the demo is not a solution, that's old code that has been replaced. We'll figure this out, promise : )\n. Awesome, thanks so much @proclamo for reporting this and for contributing!\n. I don't understand the question. Could you try to clarify or add a code example? Please don't use php though, use the rendered html/js result.\n. I still am not sure what your issue is. Could you make an example of the problem using http://jsfiddle.net/ ?\n. Closing due to inactivity - will reopen if the OP comes back with clarification of the issue!\n. Yep, the share button does not use border-box sizing, so changing all elements to use border box sizing will mess it up. What you can do to resolve this is only apply border box sizing to your gallery rather than every element on the page : )\n. Perhaps it would help to go back and review css basics a bit more. I would recommend checking out this book to get a better understanding of how selectors work and reading up on box-sizing. \nI could just tell you how to fix it, and I'm sure that's what you want, but it's only going to get you to the next css bug, which really isn't that helpful. Teach a man to fish etc - you know the deal. Happy to help with css questions and such, hit me on twitter and I can try to send you down the right path if you're stuck.\nI'm going to close this issue since it's not a problem with share-button, but happy to continue discussing here if you have related questions or followups - only closing to keep the issues section focused on things that are actively being worked on for this project.\n. Ok, so looking at your site it appears as if you are using a theme and have not yet written any of your own css. Judging by your comments above, in which you don't totally understand how to apply styles to a particular element, I would have to assume that your understanding of CSS is at the little to nothing level.\nWhile I could tell you how to fix this problem on your page, the second you need to make another change in the CSS, you will immediately be stuck because you don't know CSS at all. The reason I suggested the resources above is because by building even a basic understanding of CSS, you would be able to figure out how to resolve this yourself, which is awesome - you're learning, you're moving forwards, and you are working on something you get, instead of shoving a bunch of different pieces together and preying that they will work.\nThat being said, here's the fix to your issue. Remove the line you pointed out that applies box sizing to everything  (it's in demo.css right near the top) and replace it with this:\ncss\n.header-container {\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\nBut that's the last question I'll answer until you at least make an attempt to learn and understand what you're doing. Because code is awesome, and learning is important.\n. It will work as long as you also remove the line that applies border-box sizing to every element, as I noted in my response. You are correct, my explanation can apply to anything. When building things, you should always have a basic understanding of what you are doing, websites are no exception.\n. Then also try applying the box-sizing rules to the gallery elements specifically, or looking to see if any global styles are also affecting the gallery, or manually adjusting the share button styles to work with box-sizing. There are a bunch of ways you can tackle trying to debug this. You could also try isolating a test case in http://jsfiddle.net and asking on stack overflow. Programming and making websites is not a precision art - when you run into a snag, you gotta pull them apart until you can figure out what's wrong, then fix it. I can assure you there is a solution here, but you gotta work at it!\n. Woah, bootstrap really does border box on all elements? That's crazy. But yeah we can fix that -- @michaelkoelewijn why don't you send a pull request with your change! Then you have get credit for the contribution. If I don't get a response I'll push this change along with a new release by tomorrow.\n. Hah ok, I'll have a fix out shortly then, thanks for following up here guys, I stay away from bootstrap like the plague so I wouldn't have caught that one\n. That's a good call, I'll add that for the next release. In the meantime, if you are looking for a way to do it, you can actually just write the css for it yourself - the markup injects direct onto the page with no iframes or anything and I tried to make it as clean as possible. Example:\ncss\n.share-button label:hover {\n  color: red;\n  background: blue;\n}\n. Hey @yingban, you can have multiple share buttons on a page. Could you please describe what your issue is in more detail? If possible, it would be useful if you could create a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem you're having - this way I can quickly direct you towards a solution.\nEDIT: Here's a base for you to start with: http://jsfiddle.net/95cVL/\n. Ah yes this is true @yingban, but this is because you are hitting them all with the same selector, which is why they are popping up at the same time. But I can see why you would want to do this and have them go off separately, let me see if I can get in a patch for this :smile: \nWe'll have a fix out for this in the next day or two. Thanks for noticing @yingban!\n. A fix for this is now out thanks to some excellent work by @tmilewski : )\n. Hey Luca,\nI agree with your evaluation in general, let me address it point by point:\n1. The reason I load the entire font rather than a stripped down version is customization. You can customize both the text on the button and the icon used to the left if you want. Because of this, if I stripped the font to just those letters and only that icon, you lose the ability to change things if you want.\n2. This is not feasible without again killing customization options. Since you get to choose the class, colors, etc. on your share button, this info is rendered dynamically into the stylesheet, which means that it needs to be touched by JS before render. For this reason, it's processed through a javascript function that makes sure the classes, colors, etc, are all correct at runtime then injected inline. If you want to see the styles, you can just look at the source, or use the inspector in your browser of choice to see what classes are on the element as you usually would - I don't think it would make it any easier to have them in a separate stylesheet, and it certainly would not make it faster.\nSo I guess what I would say overall is that while you are correct that making the changes you mentioned would make the button lighter (although certainly not more modular), it would also kill all the flexibility built in and only allow you to use the button in it's default state or face some weird issues.\nThat being said, I don't think that's such a bad thing. I think most people do use it in it's default state -- I certainly do -- and I think it would be a great idea to make a third build of the button that was as slim and inflexible as possible for the situations where you need that. As kyle mentioned above, if you do want to take a stab at this and submit a pull request that would be awesome, and we would be very likely to accept it. I would just say rather than overwriting the button as it exists now, have it built out to an alternate from the cakefile so we can offer it as an option :grinning: .\n. Hey @canadiannomad -- I'm not sure if you read my lengthy response as to why the css can't be pulled out without sacrificing flex, but a detailed reason why I can't accept an overwriting PR with separated css is written above. That being said, I am planning on releasing a third build that is inflexible and slimmer, presenting only the default options and allowing the opportunity to separate css if you want. This will be landing in the next week or two : )\nAs for the FB popup checking, this functionality is covered, the reason it checks app_id is because it will set up facebook for you if it ins't already initialized, as seen here, which it needs the app_id for. In addition, you might not want to share attached to the app that you have initialized, so rather than forcing that it seems better to me to give users the option to choose whether they do want to do this. Because of the way the logic works, if you already have facebook initialized with an app, you can just pass true to the app_id param as a confirmation that you do want to share from that app, and everything should work fine. Assuming that any page that has facebook set up wants to share from that app though, I think would be assuming too much.\nAs far as the data-x attributes, I really don't like that pattern. I like keeping javascript in javascript, and html in html. This keeps both clean. Shoving data attributes and extra classes all over your html makes it messy and difficult to read, and un-separates your concerns, making things less modular, which is against the unix philosophy that I try to follow strongly in all my projects (same reason I don't like bootstrap, which puts your css into your html, and angular, which puts javascript in your html). So while I fully support you adding this in your fork, I don't see the data attribute checking as likely to show up in our version.\nOverall, thanks for sharing your changes and it was interesting to read through how you made them -- always great to have feedback on the process. Will keep all this in mind working on the future of share-button :grinning: \n. @canadiannomad The intent isn't to have you mod the source to change the css - you can just override the classes if you need to in your own stylesheet, or use the plugin's interface to customize style and behavior. Bootstrap works in much the same way - it provides some base styles and if you need to change them you override them, not go into the source and change the original ones.\nBut you certainly have a point in that the way that this plugin manages css is unconventional. Rather than giving you a stylesheet and saying use this, find the values you want to change, and change them if you want, it automates the changes and stylesheet injection through JS. I understand if this is something people aren't comfortable with and am planning on pushing a release in the next week that operates in a more conventional manner that can be used as an option for people that prefer it :grinning: \n. Looks good, thanks @tmilewski!\n. Seriously though longest branch name ever\n. Welcome to send a pull request if you'd like to add these!\n. Hey, you gotta start somewhere. Give it a shot! Let us know if anything is unclear or you need help. Adding these two is a matter of:\n1. Adding the css styling\n2. Adding network-specific options for email and pinterest in the js\n3. ???\n4. Profit!\n. That's the spirit! You'll see options being set up for the other networks in the file already, you can always follow that example to get a rough start in the right direction.\n. @mckane try https://www.bountysource.com/ : )\n. Hey, that's the spirit! Happy to help either or both of you guys along the way :sheep: \n. @reil86 no problem, and sounds good! :+1: \n. Ooh this is a really difficult issue. Any thoughts as for what you would expect the output to be? Just moving the entire tooltip to the right in this situation? That would also potentially mean that the pointer would have to change color as well, if it were to still be centered on the button.\n. Oh right, you mean like the direction from which it extends from the button. That might be a nice option to have :cake: \n. Thanks to @tmilewski for closing this one out!\n. Beast! Can we get this on the examples page?\n. Looks awesome @tmilewski -- last thing, could you also add the option to the docs in the readme?\n. To add some extra info here, the AMD build is the only piece that would benefit from any actual extra code, and would probably look to see if define is defined, and if so wrap in a define block that depends on jquery. The latest versions of jquery are now on npm and stable, so it might be worth considering adding jquery to the package.json as a dep, but jquery's integration with npm is very young, and I wonder if this would end up confusing people further. The bower piece should be simple -- very similar to npm, but it's built very specifically for client side: https://github.com/bower/bower#defining-a-package\n. I know @tmilewski was talking about adding this as well -- it should be easy enough to add to the code. Like Kyle mentioned though, we'd love to get you involved and have you send in a PR if you're up for it!\n. Hey @Stevan2 - I think the issue here is what you pointed out yourself, you are using the example page, copied and pasted, without editing.\nThe example page is configured to connect with a carrot facebook app to show the facebook app connect functionality, and the facebook app has to be authorized to run only on certain domains. Therefore, it works on our live example page, but not on your domains or locally, because you are still binding to the carrot facebook app id.\nInstructions for setting up the plugin on your own can be found here. Following these steps will yield better results. To solve that specific issue, if you remove the app_id line from the options passed to the plugin, it should resolve correctly.\n. I think this is at least partially a result of the load time coming out of the icon font. But agreed, I have seen this flicker before and would like to get rid of it. Removing the hide animation doesn't help with this (I tried), it has to do with the fact that the markup is on the page unstyled, then gets injected and the icons load. The hide call is an attempt to at least get the unstyled markup hidden until things have loaded, but we can still get a flash occasionally.\nIf it is really bothering you, in the meantime if you load the script it the <head> it should resolve it. We're working on an alternate version as well that has fewer customization options but loads faster and presents a separate stylesheet, when that's out everything will be instant.\n. This should be resolved now - we are now loading from a much quicker CDN and the flicker won't happen anymore. We do still have allowing the fonts to be loaded by the user on our roadmap, but at the moment we are hosting on cloudflare, which is likely even quicker than loading locally and should solve this issue :grinning: \n. I don't like the pattern of putting css or js info into html tags, but I do know that a lot of people do like it (angular, bootstrap, etc) -- anyone else have thoughts on this?\n. There are a number of other ways to do it. One would be instantiating the share button on each post page and rendering the data into the javascript instantiation block. Another would be pulling the text you need from where is is rendered at runtime like this:\njs\n$('.button').share({ title: $('.title').text() });\nI generally agree that allowing the user to choose is a good option, and this will almost certainly be merged, but that won't change the fact that I don't like this pattern, or any pattern that mixes up html with javascript :smile: \n. Yeah, definitely true. I'm working on a way to slim down the options as much as possible, externalize stylesheets, and boost the load time, but have been fighting cross-browser rendering. I can put what I have up on a branch if you want\n. Good call. Seems like this would be the best way to do it - since this is your idea, want to put in a pull request to implement it? If not, we can grab it :grinning: \n. :+1: \n. Looks good, thanks @pasine!\n. This doesn't even make sense to me. The logic for this is here -- it should only be set to \"Share\" if opts.text is false or undefined. Testing it quickly, it appears as if empty string is a falsey value where if you even set it as a single space, it works. Weird.\nAnother issue I found here is that the popup does not auto-center when you change the text. This could be a tough calculation, but should be worked out.\nI'll get in a patch for at least the first issue today and report back here.\n. Awesome - thanks to @tmilewski for closing this one out\n. I'll mock something today or tomorrow :octopus: \n. Good catch, I'll have this patched shortly\n. I'll check this out today. One suggestion we've had is to balance it out with an email button on the other side...\n. I'm sorry, I haven't yet. I promise I haven't forgotten, just busy this week. I'll get to it as soon as I can!\n. Pulled this commit into #53 and added some more stuff, closing this PR, but it's contents will still be merged via #53! Thanks so much @devknoll for excellent work here.\n. I'm not seeing this issue - any particular steps I could take to reproduce?\n. Are you able to reproduce this in incognito in chrome? It might be an extension interfering...\n. No worries - thanks for keeping an eye out, and hope you can find the whack plugin!\n. It's on my list, but is a lot of work to cross-browser test everything up. Interested in helping out with this?\n. Is it that you are morally opposed to coffeescript, or that you can't figure out what's going on in the source?\n. I suppose. The two languages are very similar, and the source here is fairly short and simple, so it doesn't seem to me like it would be difficult to make changes. But of course it's your time and your choice! As soon as we can finish this, I'll notify and close out the issue : )\n. :open_mouth: :confetti_ball: \n. Perfect, this looks great - thank you @brunolazzaro! A couple more things, and this should be ready to merge:\n- Squash those two commits together (ref)\n- Could you use present imperative tense for the commit messages? It's what we've been using for all commits in this repo so far, just trying to keep it consistent. So for example, it would be \"center twitter and google+ popups\"\n- Could you rebase this on master? It's not totally caught up to the current head.\n- If you add the words closes #33 to the bottom of the pull request text, it will auto-close the issue when merged :smile: \n. It looks like something went wrong with your rebase. To do this right, you'll want to add this repo as an upstream, fetch, then rebase master. If it comes out right, it should be just your one commit in the pull request : )\n. Perfect, looks great. Merge coming soon : )\n. Thanks @girasquid!\n. Hey @EXFS, any update here? I'm going to close the issue since this is more of a request for us to help debug your page than an issue with share button as far as we are aware, but discussion is still welcome, and if this does end up being an issue with share-button I'll re-open it :grinning: \n. Duplicate of #32 - we are working on this one!\n. I've gotta agree with this, I don't think we should support this option. If you'd like to fork the project and add it yourself, you are welcome to do this, but I don't think opening the popup over the button itself is something we'll support here.\nGoing to close this issue, but discussion is still welcome!\n. You're definitely right, there hasn't been a release tagged that includes them yet. Sorry -- this is because we're working on some other features we'd like to include in the next release. But to be fair, there's no reason not to push incremental releases as well. I'll get one pushed up now and fix this :grinning: \n. You are definitely right, we are working with weloveiconfonts to see if we can resolve this, and also on an option that bundles in the fonts locally. Thanks for calling this one out though, and I promise it's in the pipeline!\n. This seems like a firefox bug rather than an issue with our css, to be honest. I don't think that kind of one pixel strip on an element that's both hidden and scaled away from that location is something you can fix with css, unless it's some sort of ugly workaround to firefox's bug.\nThanks for having a sharp eye and pointing this out (and it would be awesome if you could figure out how to fix it for sure), but I'm going to mark this low priority for now just to make sure we have our issues in order :grinning: \n. Woah, that is super weird. There's gotta be something going on there... have you cleared your cache etc? We are loading icons such that they should be working in ff6 without issue.\nWe'll check this out though and see if we can reproduce. Until then enjoy the abstract art version of the button, hah. Someday that might be worth millions :wink: \n. Hey @stalluri!\nIt seems like you are new to github -- welcome! Just as a general tip, it's a good idea to use the title of the issue as a short summary of what the problem is, and use the description to add more details on your request.\nIt's also a good idea to look through the issues or search the repo using the search bar up top to see if someone has already filed a matching issue. In this case you might have found https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/22, which addresses the same thing.\nI'm not totally clear on what you mean with the bit.ly link piece, but perhaps you can comment on #22 and add some more feedback there. I'm going to close out this issue though, as it's a duplicate.\n. Yeah, I don't think that's been dealt with here, the colors would need to change slightly\n. Hey, sorry this has not been merged yet. We're working on a way to make this totally configurable still. If you want to use it, feel free to grab the files from this pull request though!\n. Remove the facebook app_id and it will work. Read the docs rather than just copy/pasting our demo page!\n. Thanks @vadakkan - sorry it's taking a while. Really our goal is to have you be able to choose which networks you want to include, but this is a fairly complex feature so it's taking a bit. If you want to get your hands on this right now, you can pull down the branch and use the code there, it does work fine :grinning: \n. You can always overwrite the share text if you want as well: https://github.com/carrot/share-button#options\n. You'd have to manually grab the title to do this. You could get it with something like this, with jquery:\njs\n$('title').text()\nThe reason your code there doesn't work as expected is because you are passing through a string, so it just comes back as a string.\n. @rudemex good catch, you're right. We're taking a look at this now, it should be resolved soon!\nTambi\u00e9n puede responder en espa\u00f1ol si es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil : )\n. @rudemex si, gracias por encontrar y publicar esto. Hemos estado haciendo cambios en la prestaci\u00f3n de los iconos para aumentar la velocidad -- esto fue un error y estamos arreglando pronto!\n. This should be resolved as of v0.0.6 which was just pushed :smile: \n. We need these font assets to be in the repo rather that privately served. I can add to the build task so that it deploys with a local config file. But PRs like this don't really tell us anything because you made all the changes to a private file and just changed the reference...\n. I wonder if this is the best way to version - I feel like we could get up to v45 quickly at this rate. What was actually changed with the font files?\n. Still not seeing them functional on sharebutton.co - if we merged you're saying it would be fixed though?\n. I know you are busy this week @tmilewski but let me know if there's any update here when you are freed up again :grinning: \n. I kind of like having lato in there for the design aspect :grinning: \n. @assassinateur if you want to replace the font and icons, at this point it might be a good idea to fork this project. we try to make it as flexible as we can, but being able to swap out the icon set and fonts is a little beyond scope\n. I understand the concern and desire to eliminate, but tbh the google fonts version looks vastly better still in my eyes. Like huge amounts. Maybe we could make it optional?\n. The https thing isn't an issue, if you look at the code above protocol is an option\n. @jgclifton directly above your comment :grinning: \n. I would be totally ok with this if the default were set to true :grinning: \n. Hey @pixeline -- thanks for pointing this out, we are working on resolving it. For now we're going to use #55 to ref this issue, but I'll let you know as soon as it's closed out!\n. I have no idea, have not used it in this environment. Are you seeing any errors in the console? I can help best with a little more context of what's going wrong...\n. Ok, perhaps you can expand the security policy to allow scripts from facebook, or include that separately and remove it from the plugin like you did? It works perfectly without the facebook SDK, just an additional option if needed.\nIf this is resolved though you can close out the issue!\n. Just going to close this for now, unless there is an update. It's been inactive for almost a month\n. ping @tmilewski \n. Great suggestion, agreed. Would you be interested in putting in a pull request to make this change? It should be a fairly simple one, and would be a good way to get involved :grinning: \n. I'm sorry, I don't use wordpress so I can't really help with this one, but hopefully someone else will be able to. I'm going to close this issue since it's more of a request for help than an issue with the script, but feel free to continue discussion here!\n. What do you need python for? And coffeescript is included in the dependencies, if I'm not mistaken...\n. Hmm. you're on windows?\n. Ah, you're right. Ok so to run cake, coffee is a dependency - should have put that in, sorry! The python thing is only an issue on windows, I'm quite sure about that one. Could you modify it so that it says \"windows only\" for the python piece (just to not confuse people who arent on windows), then I'll merge?\n. Yup!\n. Hey Dan,\nThis looks fantastic - thanks so much for the contribution! Love to see you getting this code in. Just a couple nitpicky commit things:\n1. Remove the installation instructions commit from this PR, it's part of a separate issue\n2. We prefer commits in present imperative tense, so it would be \"create opengraph and twitter card fallbacks\"\n3. You can actually close out the issue you opened from the commit using closes #X, so your commit could read create opengraph and twitter card fallbacks, closes #61\n4. Squash the console.log remove commit into the previous commit, just for cleanliness :grinning: \n. Perfect, thanks again Dan for the hard work getting this in order!\n. Just make sure to rebase off master for the next pull request now that this has been merged :smile: \n. :+1: \n. Perfect, well done :clap: \n. Awesome! Thanks for your contributions so far, and looking forward to it :grinning: \n. Sounds like a good addition - any interest in pull requesting this in and claiming credit for the change? :grinning: \n. Awesome, thanks - keep us updated!\n. Hey @CoLzAk - we don't manually minify, it's done through UglifyJS, a very popular and widely used javascript minifier which uses the \"bang style\" for IIFE's as described in your issue. What you are describing here is actually an issue with assetic's apparent incompatibility with UglifyJS, which is a bug that should be filed in assetic's repo rather than here.\n. Rebase on master?\n. :tada: \n. Hey @seanlinsley, this looks great, I'd say good for merge. I think perhaps we should also include auto-pulling of certain data attributes as a part of the plugin itself (with this method as a way to overwrite that functionality if you wanted). We had a PR open to do this before but never quite got around to it. Any thoughts on this @tmilewski?\n. :+1: on this from me\n. Could you do a little more investigation and see if you can figure out what's causing this? We can't spend our time debugging meteor apps, but if you can find the portion of share-button that's causing a conflict it would be easier for us to start narrowing down what the issue is. \n. Ok, going to close this until it is once again relevant and/or you can find the issue!\n. No idea. What browser/os are you using? Have you tried it in incognito mode to make sure it's not an extension interfering if you are on chrome? It's being used in many places right now and working fine, so I feel like it's almost certainly an issue with your setup rather than the code.\n. Yeah I'm sorry, I wish I could help more but there is not enough information here for me to debug it yet. If you post anything else you find out I'll see if I can pick out what the issue is\n. I thought it was just the presence of #fb-root that was needed for initializing the facebook sdk... does it also need content?\n. This was just merged and should be fixed now. Thanks guys!\n. Remove the facebook app_id from the options. You probably copy-pasted the example from our example page and it uses our facebook application id. You don't need an app id for it to work, that's just an option you can use to get tighter fb integration. You can find all this info in the docs if you take a moment to scan them over :grinning: \n. No problem, if I had a dollar for every person who has made that same mistake and posted slash emailed me that problem I would... well, probably have like 10 more dollars. But either way you are certainly not the first person so no worries.\n. Can you please be more specific with what the error is, and when it occurs?\n. Ok, do you think those updates will solve this issue? Are you guys working with the script from master?\n. Good catch! Want to submit a pull request to update the readme?\n. Could you post a screenshot so we can see what you mean?\n. There is not, but you can change it yourself just by writing css :grinning: \n. I'm leaning toward saying anything that can be styled with css should be...\n. This shouldn't be happening, if so it's an issue with the browser not cacheing/rendering things too slowly. Although I recall this happening with older versions, I'm unable to replicate it with the most recent one.\n. Could you dig a little deeper here for me? Examples of things you could do to help with this:\n- Comment the axis typography mixin out and see if that fixes it, narrowing down what exactly is causing the issue\n- Inspect the source to see if the share-button css is not already applied last\nDebugging ftw! I'm closing this issue as it's a personal one and not a problem with share button but we can keep discussing it here.\n. Ok, keep digging and see if you can pinpoint the issue. Keep narrowing it down. This is almost certainly not an issue with share-button, it's likely an issue with global css styles leaking into the button, which is something we can't prevent from happening.\n. :tada: good work!\n. You can select it with css and change the size...\n. You can use the inspector in any web browser to view the underlying html and css on a page in order to be able to create a css selector.\ncss\n.share-button label {\n  font-size: 5em;\n}\n. - You can change the title using the title attribute in the configuration options.\n- You can change the size using the code I produced above\n- You can change the position using css on your website, this plugin just produces a button, it doesn't place the button where you want it within your site automatically.\nI'm really sorry, but we cannot debug your personal site here, issues are for discussing problems or requested features for this plugin. It seems like your issue is that you are having trouble using css and javascript and/or understanding the documentation, which isn't something we can provide further assistance with. There are many resources you can find on the web that will help you to learn more about css and javascript, and the documentation in this repo will help you to use share-button the way you want if you read it through.\n. Hey @Ljanmi - I'm really sorry but like I said before we can't debug your site for you. If you are having an issue with the css, you can use the inspector in your browser to investigate and debug the problem. In this case you probably need a more specific selector to override. Again, this is not an issue with share-button, it's an issue on your site, and we simply don't have time to debug everyone's personal stuff.\n. That's the best part about open source, you can fork a project and make any changes you want. You can also submit your changes back to the original repo with a pull request and if they are good they will probably be pulled in.\nWhen working with open source projects, it's important to keep in mind that we are working to provide this to you for free, and in addition offering free support for it. If it were a paid service, you would be more entitled to ask for personal support and changes that you specifically want, but the fact is that this is a collaborative open source project. If you think you'd like to make changes to this plugin, please do so and we'd be happy to review them. And even if we don't accept them, you can still continue to use your own forked version!\nAlso, I can't help but note that while you claim the opposite, you are actually the only one complaining. We have no other open issues and hundreds of people happily using this code.\n. Yeah I like this direction. I think removing as much css as we can is probably the right way to go.\n. Wow, that's really a bad one, thanks for catching that. I think @tmilewski would know how to fix this particular one best\n. Very gracefully handled @tmilewski - no need for the extra snark in your issues @devonmather, we're here to help you out.\n. Yeah, sorry about that! Lots of changes. This started out as more of a drop-in solution, but as it's picked up and people have wanted more and more customization we've been moving towards making it a little more flexible :grinning: \n. :+1: \n. Hi @martinbetz!\nSo share button is not intended for this purpose and should not be used for it. Usually the best way to keep blog entries in sync with facebook or twitter is by using a different tool for that purpose. Popular blogging systems like tumblr and wordpress have this functionality built in, but I assume since you are talking about python here you are building one from scratch (any reason not to use something like tumblr? It's fully themeable, has a community and support for a lot of tools for publishing, can support custom domains, and is free). If that is the case, maybe a tool like networkedblogs would help to auto-publish your posts, assuming you have an rss feed set up.\nGood luck!\n. You do not want to use a javascript library for this task - don't do this or you will be looking in the wrong place. You want to either use a library that auths with facebook and can post to it from flask, or a library that will listen on your rss feed and sync it like that, like the one I posted above.\n. Oh hi Sacha!\nSo more or less the entire point of this plugin is to not have the social buttons appear inline, because it takes up a lot more space that way, and can't be optimized to load quicker by only loading more expensive pieces when the user has an intent to share (aka when they click share). So I don't see this becoming a feature here specifically, although I do think that would be a nice fork.\nThere's also mojotech's social builder, crafted lovingly by the amazing @samccone, which I think is closer to fitting the style you're thinking about.\n. Would love to see you take a stab at it! Open source ftw : )\n. Can you post more information about how you are trying to make this work?\n. In your browser console, can you access window.Share?\n. Oh never mind, I see the issue, that was a silly question for me to ask. You aren't actually bringing it in to your script, which is why it's not there. At the top where you define the libs you want to use, you only actually name the ring parameter. You need to add a second param to that function and call it Share in order to actually use what share-button exports. Since you are using requirejs, it's not attached to any global namespace, you need to manage it manually.\nTo be extra clear, here's what code you have:\njs\ndefine([\n    'ring',\n    'libs/share.min'\n], function (ring) {\nAnd this is the code you need:\njs\ndefine([\n    'ring',\n    'libs/share.min'\n], function (ring, Share) {\n.

Sweet -- do you see why this is the case though? If you do understand this, it will make it much easier for you to use other libraries as well. With require (or any other module loader), rather than having everything that's exported attach to window, you manually manage the exports within the scopes you need. This is a good thing, and is how it should be, but it requires a slightly different mindset from the standard drop a script tag and attach everything to window approach.\n. If you want to use a custom facebook app id, the facebook sdk needs to be loaded - the fb_root stuff is in their documentation.\n. No, that would remove most of the utility of the share button, stripping it to just essentially a button with a click handler. If you want to write your own custom css fully from scratch, I'd recommend forking the project. If you just want to modify some of our styles, you can override them (all styles here)\n. Hey @raffone -- sorry for the late response, but in general I think you're right here. I'm going to take a look at this over the next week or two and see if I can make custom styling much easier and potentially take your suggestion and include an option to strip all css, because it really is very painful at the moment to customize the appearance.\n. We're happy to review pull requests for this stuff! I haven't really had time to audit this project in a couple months, but hoping to come back to it eventually and overhaul stuff like this.\n. Hey @ilompf - have you made sure that the issue is with the share button plugin rather than your generateDeepLink() function? If you log out the results of that function above the call to share button you should see this. As long as that function returns a string, the string should be included. Functions aren't treated any differently.\n. Hi @ilompf -- sorry for the delay in getting back to you here! I just tested it with the exact link that you provided as a string inputting into the description field for email, and it worked perfectly fine. Here's a jsfiddle reproduction:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/58CSA/\nIt seems like the issue is likely with the function you are using to generate the link as mentioned earlier, or that there's something else on your site interfering with the way that share button operates. This sounds like a difficult issue, but based on this reproduction I don't think it's an issue with share button.\n. Yup, right in this config options: ui.icon_font can be set to false.\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/Configuration-Options\n. Yep, I'm good with this. I might make it a colon rather than a newline though, I don't think newlines work like this in email bodies across all clients. Want to put in a PR for this?\n. https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L195 :grinning: \n. Perhaps something like this?\ncoffee\nbody: \"#{@config.networks.email.description} -- #{@config.url}\"\n. Looks good to me - it's probably because of an updated version of umd if I had to guess, which should be fine. Any thoughts on this @tmilewski?\n. Thanks @LCMiller :grinning: - so glad its working well for you!\nIt's something we are working on, but passively. This plugin is pretty set on a slim and focused experience rather than having a bajillion buttons for every network imaginable. We don't currently have a linkedin option, but it's something we are thinking about and happy to look over contributions for.\nI'm going to close this issue since it's already here https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/96 but happy to continue discussing if you want!\n. :+1: sorry about the brief outage!\n. Hi @elsondinardo -- we don't use magento, so it's unlikely that we're going to do this, but this plugin is open source and we'd love to have you take it on!\n. If we did this, there would be no point to having a button at all, if you didn't have to click it. This kind of change would be better fit to a fork of the project that doesn't include a button.\nWe included the button on purpose to make it lighter on the page, take up less space, and load faster, since they don't load unless it's opened.\n. Good call, thanks @slang800 :+1: \n. Hey @leeroyrose -- you want to make your changes in the source file rather than the build file is possible. You can then run cake build to build the project. Refer here for instructions on contributing.\nIt would also be helpful if you included a screenshot of how this looks! But thank you so much for working on this and contributing, we really do appreciate it. Looking forward to getting this merged after a few updates :grinning: \n. Of course! I'm the one who owes you a thanks though for jumping in and contributing :grinning: \nIf there's anything I can help with or advise on just ping here!\n. Hey @1parkplace -- sorry for the late response (was away this weekend) and glad you managed to work this out! This is a solid suggestion, would you be interested in putting in a pull request to add this to the readme?\n. This is not currently an option. I don't see it as an issue worth fixing personally, as you click on the button then select whichever social network you want to share on. It's not like people are more likely to click the left, right or middle one, they click on the one they want to use. We'd be happy to look over a pull request if you want to take stab at implementing this though!\n. Definitely, good catches here. Would you be interested in contributing fixes to these things? They are fairly straightforward and we love to get people involved :grinning: \n. Looks great, thanks so much! Just waiting on @tmilewski's approval and this should be merged up. Closing this issue as we have the pull request open now. :tada: \n. Looks good to me :+1: \n. Yeah I agree. The arrow was a casualty of making more networks available to add/remove from the popup. The logic to detect networks have been added/removed then position and color the arrow correctly seemed ridiculous. I liked it too though and would like to get it added back in at some point.\n. You can see the styles that are generated here - if you just write css that overrides these styles, it will work fine :grinning: \n. @tmilewski critical\n. :+1: \n. I feel like most people haven't had issues integrating it into existing layouts to be honest. What is the exact issue you're having?\nWhat you're describing sounds like it would be more flexible for sure, but the point of this plugin is for it to work well and look good out of the box. What you're describing is essentially a js plugin that puts an active class on when you click an element, then requires you to do the rest of the customization yourself...\n. Yeah it seems like you should be writing your own code to do this to be honest. What you want is an entirely custom element, not this plugin which is a self-contained share button.\nAlso it helps a lot to use floats with clearfixed containers over inline block. This eliminates some weird spacing issues and increases compatibility with older browsers :grinning: \n. You certainly could, fork away! That's what open source is all about.\n. I don't think changing this one to a web component is the way to go, so having an \"upgrade path\" was not even on my mind. But I'd be happy to link to a web component fork someone made in the readme! Either way if this is something you are serious about let's open that up in a new issue if you want to talk about it.\nThis issue I'm going to close it out, because it's asking for too fundamental of a change from what this plugin is, but I support the idea and again I think a fork or another library that has that functionality would be worth exploring :grinning: \n. I don't see us adding this until we can roll out the enable/disable network feature in a more intuitive manner, tbh. But happy to review a pull request if you'd like to jump in!\n. I'd give this a :+1: -- if @tmilewski agrees I'd say let's merge up.\n. We moved away from jquery a while ago as we don't want to lock in to it for people that don't use it. The good news is that it's pretty easy to convert a jquery collection to a dom collection using toArray. Perhaps we should include this in the docs rather than include a special case for jquery? If we allow jquery, who's to say we shouldn't also have special handling for any other dom selection library that exists or comes out in the future?\n. @patrick91 thanks for the contribution! It looks like it only checks the right side, were you planning on adding checks for left, top, and bottom as well?\n. Definitely, if we're pulling this in for everyone we'll need that :grinning: \n. :two_men_holding_hands: \n. This is a massive change in the design of the project. The whole point of the button is to compact the shares and delay the loading of all that stuff until a person actually wants to share. If you don't need to click the button, why have a button in the first place, right? So now that the button has been stripped out, it's just a row of customizable share icons, which is a different project.\nYou are welcome to do this if you'd like, but it would be better as a fork than an option in this project, since the button is the entire point :grinning: Thank you for the feedback though, and still very much open to discussion even though I am going to close this issue.\n. Yeah, I see what you are saying for sure. But the entire point of this project is to have it require an additional click. Our general view on this is that if people want to share your page, they will do so, and we trade an additional click for the following benefits: \n- If you have a button that says \"SHARE\" in clear capital letters, it seems counter-intuitive to me that someone would like your content enough to share it, intend to share it by clicking that button, then once they see the networks go \"Shit I have to click again? This is way too much work, fuck it\" and not share the page.\n- A bunch of share buttons on a page is spammy-looking and visually distracting. Compressing them into a button frees up visual real estate on your page and makes it look more elegant and less spammy.\n- When you hide the networks behind a button, you can load the page much quicker, as mentioned previously, and load less of the networks' tracking scripts and other bullshit without the user intending for that to happen.\nThese are totally opinions backed by zero research at all. If someone did research on this, it would be awesome, I'd be interested to see the result. But with all that being said, using this library is a trade-off -- one some people are willing to make and others are not. For those who are not, they typically choose not to use this library. But we are, which is why we made and use it.\n. Sure -- would definitely be interested to see the result! There are certainly plenty of factors that should be taken into account in such a test, but even a rough measure would be interesting.\n. :+1: \n. I don't see why that wouldn't work, that's just javascript, has nothing to do with this plugin...\n. You can override these styles to customize. There are no inline styles added by js, they are all css and can be overridden :grinning: \n. Any objections? If not I'll merge this end of today\n. Screenshot/gif?\n. This looks pretty good to me. @tmilewski thoughts? Also do we have support for enabling/disabling specific networks? the number of buttons here is getting pretty high\n. Agreed, I think this should definitely be a feature\n. Yeah, I think this is actually a limitation of mailto links. I did a bunch of research into this a while back, and while it's possible to get newlines to render in a couple of random email clients if they are escaped, most of them will not render a newline from a mailto link.\nThis is rather unfortunate, but I would recommend simply using a one liner or a single paragraph for the email share because of this :confused: \n. If I'm not mistaken, theres a good reason why we encode the data first. @tmilewski would probably be able to tell you more about this.\nIt might work fine in whatever email client you are opening it in at the moment, but I definitely recall testing newlines in a bunch of different email clients and having it not work in many of them. If you have tested across a wide range and it works in all of them, a lot of progress must have been made and that's great.\nEither way, I'll have to look into encoding and mailto links to see if it's safe enough across clients to create an exception for this property.\n. Hi @treeskelt -- I'm really sorry but I'm traveling for an extended period of time at the moment and am not able to continue being vigilant with maintenance for this library until I get back. Perhaps someone else from @carrot/devs would be able to help out!\n. Yeah this depends on whether each individual network provides a callback. As we add more networks, this will become difficult to make consistent as a feature. If you could look into the support other networks have for a post-share callback and post it here, that would help a ton!\n. Reddit background color is too light. Otherwise, looking fresh!\n. Good call, thanks! Totally missed that one\n. Interesting, had never thought of this or used it. Yeah we could definitely switch this over to using web intents. The only thing that bothers me about it is loading twitter's widget external javascript. I wanted to try to load as few external deps as possible to keep this quick and light. But either way the option should definitely be there.\nIf you'd like, feel free to take a crack at this and send in a pull request - the code is fairly simple and there are build and contribution instructions in the readme. If not, I'll see about getting this in sometime this week.\nEdit: Twitter's script is quite heavy...\n. Closing due to inactivity\n. Ah, great catch. I'll take a look at this and see if there's a fix we can get in here that's somewhat elegant :thumbsup: \n. There are instructions provided here for contributing and how to run the grunt compiler :smile: \nEDIT: Oh, the styles thats right. Yeah that's a weird thing, I should probably have a script that handles that as well. Yeah for now it's manual compile and paste like you mentioned, but note that it's something of a template, so you need to also keep those template values. All in all, this process is not very reasonable though, I'll try to integrate it in with the grunt task.\n. Hey @austinpray - finally got around to redoing the build script so that it's easier to contribute to the styles. Now the stylus file in the src folder will be automatically compiled into the script when you run cake build. Hope this makes life easier, and let me know if you figure out the 1 pixel glitch!\n. Hope so! I also just added a watch task, so you can run cake watch and hack away at it, just refreshing to see changes\n. @q2amarket your comment seems to obviously be a troll, I'm going to delete it unless you'd like to edit to clarify or remove it yourself. You have one day to respond.\n. @q2amarket  It's not a fix for the problem, and would make everything yellow on hover which makes no sense\n. Closing due to inactivity and because this is a chrome bug rather than a share-button issue. If anyone still wants to fix this, you are welcome to!\n. Ok, figured out the cause of this - it's the pointer :after element interfering. It can be fixed by setting the lis z-index. I'll put in a patch for this soon : )\n. This was patched up in the latest release :smile: \n. Ok let's try to break this down. You seem to be reporting three things here:\n1. It doesn't work in chrome\nYou need to provide more details on how to replicate the issues you are having. I tested and there are no issues in chrome that I can see, so it might be something specific to your computer. Have you tried opening it in a clean install of chrome, in an incognito window?\n2. Can you add the many buttons\nI'm not sure I could make any sense of this request, perhaps there's a different way you could word this?\n3. Could you make the menu appear vertically?\nNo, but if you would like to fork it and modify the styles to have the menu appear vertically, you are welcome to do so.\n. 1. Since it works in incognito, this means it's almost certainly one of your chrome extensions that's messing it up. Try disabling a couple extensions and see if that helps.\n2. If you have suggestions for other services, open to hearing them, and this is an open source project so we're open to contributions. The reason we chose those three is because they are the most common, and we were aiming for simplicity.\n. Closing this issue as it is certainly invalid. If you have any more questions @MajidCS feel free to ask and I'll try to help, but I'm not going to leave this issue open.\n. So the ul is actually scoped under the .share-button class (or whatever class you override it with in the options) at the moment, but as a descendent selector. If you define a set of universal ul styles, there's not much we can do to prevent it from leaking in, other than attempting to clear any other style on it.\nThat being said, I have seen leaking ul and li styles in peoples' implementations, and I wonder if there is a simple way to resolve this that doesnt make the semantics suffer. I mean technically I think the best way to handle it would be to remove ul and li and make everything divs, as more or less nobody would define universal div styles. But technically that is less semantic...\n. Feel free to add these if you'd like - jump right into the source and make a pull request. Everything is documented as clearly as possible!\n. Hey @proclamo - I just cloned this down fresh and tried to replicate your issue but I have not been able to. Did you run npm install before building? Did you see any errors come up during build?\n. Just pushed a fix for the autoprefixer piece, try again and see if that fixes it (remove node_modules and run npm i again). Copying the string from the demo is not a solution, that's old code that has been replaced. We'll figure this out, promise : )\n. Awesome, thanks so much @proclamo for reporting this and for contributing!\n. I don't understand the question. Could you try to clarify or add a code example? Please don't use php though, use the rendered html/js result.\n. I still am not sure what your issue is. Could you make an example of the problem using http://jsfiddle.net/ ?\n. Closing due to inactivity - will reopen if the OP comes back with clarification of the issue!\n. Yep, the share button does not use border-box sizing, so changing all elements to use border box sizing will mess it up. What you can do to resolve this is only apply border box sizing to your gallery rather than every element on the page : )\n. Perhaps it would help to go back and review css basics a bit more. I would recommend checking out this book to get a better understanding of how selectors work and reading up on box-sizing. \nI could just tell you how to fix it, and I'm sure that's what you want, but it's only going to get you to the next css bug, which really isn't that helpful. Teach a man to fish etc - you know the deal. Happy to help with css questions and such, hit me on twitter and I can try to send you down the right path if you're stuck.\nI'm going to close this issue since it's not a problem with share-button, but happy to continue discussing here if you have related questions or followups - only closing to keep the issues section focused on things that are actively being worked on for this project.\n. Ok, so looking at your site it appears as if you are using a theme and have not yet written any of your own css. Judging by your comments above, in which you don't totally understand how to apply styles to a particular element, I would have to assume that your understanding of CSS is at the little to nothing level.\nWhile I could tell you how to fix this problem on your page, the second you need to make another change in the CSS, you will immediately be stuck because you don't know CSS at all. The reason I suggested the resources above is because by building even a basic understanding of CSS, you would be able to figure out how to resolve this yourself, which is awesome - you're learning, you're moving forwards, and you are working on something you get, instead of shoving a bunch of different pieces together and preying that they will work.\nThat being said, here's the fix to your issue. Remove the line you pointed out that applies box sizing to everything  (it's in demo.css right near the top) and replace it with this:\ncss\n.header-container {\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\nBut that's the last question I'll answer until you at least make an attempt to learn and understand what you're doing. Because code is awesome, and learning is important.\n. It will work as long as you also remove the line that applies border-box sizing to every element, as I noted in my response. You are correct, my explanation can apply to anything. When building things, you should always have a basic understanding of what you are doing, websites are no exception.\n. Then also try applying the box-sizing rules to the gallery elements specifically, or looking to see if any global styles are also affecting the gallery, or manually adjusting the share button styles to work with box-sizing. There are a bunch of ways you can tackle trying to debug this. You could also try isolating a test case in http://jsfiddle.net and asking on stack overflow. Programming and making websites is not a precision art - when you run into a snag, you gotta pull them apart until you can figure out what's wrong, then fix it. I can assure you there is a solution here, but you gotta work at it!\n. Woah, bootstrap really does border box on all elements? That's crazy. But yeah we can fix that -- @michaelkoelewijn why don't you send a pull request with your change! Then you have get credit for the contribution. If I don't get a response I'll push this change along with a new release by tomorrow.\n. Hah ok, I'll have a fix out shortly then, thanks for following up here guys, I stay away from bootstrap like the plague so I wouldn't have caught that one\n. That's a good call, I'll add that for the next release. In the meantime, if you are looking for a way to do it, you can actually just write the css for it yourself - the markup injects direct onto the page with no iframes or anything and I tried to make it as clean as possible. Example:\ncss\n.share-button label:hover {\n  color: red;\n  background: blue;\n}\n. Hey @yingban, you can have multiple share buttons on a page. Could you please describe what your issue is in more detail? If possible, it would be useful if you could create a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem you're having - this way I can quickly direct you towards a solution.\nEDIT: Here's a base for you to start with: http://jsfiddle.net/95cVL/\n. Ah yes this is true @yingban, but this is because you are hitting them all with the same selector, which is why they are popping up at the same time. But I can see why you would want to do this and have them go off separately, let me see if I can get in a patch for this :smile: \nWe'll have a fix out for this in the next day or two. Thanks for noticing @yingban!\n. A fix for this is now out thanks to some excellent work by @tmilewski : )\n. Hey Luca,\nI agree with your evaluation in general, let me address it point by point:\n1. The reason I load the entire font rather than a stripped down version is customization. You can customize both the text on the button and the icon used to the left if you want. Because of this, if I stripped the font to just those letters and only that icon, you lose the ability to change things if you want.\n2. This is not feasible without again killing customization options. Since you get to choose the class, colors, etc. on your share button, this info is rendered dynamically into the stylesheet, which means that it needs to be touched by JS before render. For this reason, it's processed through a javascript function that makes sure the classes, colors, etc, are all correct at runtime then injected inline. If you want to see the styles, you can just look at the source, or use the inspector in your browser of choice to see what classes are on the element as you usually would - I don't think it would make it any easier to have them in a separate stylesheet, and it certainly would not make it faster.\nSo I guess what I would say overall is that while you are correct that making the changes you mentioned would make the button lighter (although certainly not more modular), it would also kill all the flexibility built in and only allow you to use the button in it's default state or face some weird issues.\nThat being said, I don't think that's such a bad thing. I think most people do use it in it's default state -- I certainly do -- and I think it would be a great idea to make a third build of the button that was as slim and inflexible as possible for the situations where you need that. As kyle mentioned above, if you do want to take a stab at this and submit a pull request that would be awesome, and we would be very likely to accept it. I would just say rather than overwriting the button as it exists now, have it built out to an alternate from the cakefile so we can offer it as an option :grinning: .\n. Hey @canadiannomad -- I'm not sure if you read my lengthy response as to why the css can't be pulled out without sacrificing flex, but a detailed reason why I can't accept an overwriting PR with separated css is written above. That being said, I am planning on releasing a third build that is inflexible and slimmer, presenting only the default options and allowing the opportunity to separate css if you want. This will be landing in the next week or two : )\nAs for the FB popup checking, this functionality is covered, the reason it checks app_id is because it will set up facebook for you if it ins't already initialized, as seen here, which it needs the app_id for. In addition, you might not want to share attached to the app that you have initialized, so rather than forcing that it seems better to me to give users the option to choose whether they do want to do this. Because of the way the logic works, if you already have facebook initialized with an app, you can just pass true to the app_id param as a confirmation that you do want to share from that app, and everything should work fine. Assuming that any page that has facebook set up wants to share from that app though, I think would be assuming too much.\nAs far as the data-x attributes, I really don't like that pattern. I like keeping javascript in javascript, and html in html. This keeps both clean. Shoving data attributes and extra classes all over your html makes it messy and difficult to read, and un-separates your concerns, making things less modular, which is against the unix philosophy that I try to follow strongly in all my projects (same reason I don't like bootstrap, which puts your css into your html, and angular, which puts javascript in your html). So while I fully support you adding this in your fork, I don't see the data attribute checking as likely to show up in our version.\nOverall, thanks for sharing your changes and it was interesting to read through how you made them -- always great to have feedback on the process. Will keep all this in mind working on the future of share-button :grinning: \n. @canadiannomad The intent isn't to have you mod the source to change the css - you can just override the classes if you need to in your own stylesheet, or use the plugin's interface to customize style and behavior. Bootstrap works in much the same way - it provides some base styles and if you need to change them you override them, not go into the source and change the original ones.\nBut you certainly have a point in that the way that this plugin manages css is unconventional. Rather than giving you a stylesheet and saying use this, find the values you want to change, and change them if you want, it automates the changes and stylesheet injection through JS. I understand if this is something people aren't comfortable with and am planning on pushing a release in the next week that operates in a more conventional manner that can be used as an option for people that prefer it :grinning: \n. Looks good, thanks @tmilewski!\n. Seriously though longest branch name ever\n. Welcome to send a pull request if you'd like to add these!\n. Hey, you gotta start somewhere. Give it a shot! Let us know if anything is unclear or you need help. Adding these two is a matter of:\n1. Adding the css styling\n2. Adding network-specific options for email and pinterest in the js\n3. ???\n4. Profit!\n. That's the spirit! You'll see options being set up for the other networks in the file already, you can always follow that example to get a rough start in the right direction.\n. @mckane try https://www.bountysource.com/ : )\n. Hey, that's the spirit! Happy to help either or both of you guys along the way :sheep: \n. @reil86 no problem, and sounds good! :+1: \n. Ooh this is a really difficult issue. Any thoughts as for what you would expect the output to be? Just moving the entire tooltip to the right in this situation? That would also potentially mean that the pointer would have to change color as well, if it were to still be centered on the button.\n. Oh right, you mean like the direction from which it extends from the button. That might be a nice option to have :cake: \n. Thanks to @tmilewski for closing this one out!\n. Beast! Can we get this on the examples page?\n. Looks awesome @tmilewski -- last thing, could you also add the option to the docs in the readme?\n. To add some extra info here, the AMD build is the only piece that would benefit from any actual extra code, and would probably look to see if define is defined, and if so wrap in a define block that depends on jquery. The latest versions of jquery are now on npm and stable, so it might be worth considering adding jquery to the package.json as a dep, but jquery's integration with npm is very young, and I wonder if this would end up confusing people further. The bower piece should be simple -- very similar to npm, but it's built very specifically for client side: https://github.com/bower/bower#defining-a-package\n. I know @tmilewski was talking about adding this as well -- it should be easy enough to add to the code. Like Kyle mentioned though, we'd love to get you involved and have you send in a PR if you're up for it!\n. Hey @Stevan2 - I think the issue here is what you pointed out yourself, you are using the example page, copied and pasted, without editing.\nThe example page is configured to connect with a carrot facebook app to show the facebook app connect functionality, and the facebook app has to be authorized to run only on certain domains. Therefore, it works on our live example page, but not on your domains or locally, because you are still binding to the carrot facebook app id.\nInstructions for setting up the plugin on your own can be found here. Following these steps will yield better results. To solve that specific issue, if you remove the app_id line from the options passed to the plugin, it should resolve correctly.\n. I think this is at least partially a result of the load time coming out of the icon font. But agreed, I have seen this flicker before and would like to get rid of it. Removing the hide animation doesn't help with this (I tried), it has to do with the fact that the markup is on the page unstyled, then gets injected and the icons load. The hide call is an attempt to at least get the unstyled markup hidden until things have loaded, but we can still get a flash occasionally.\nIf it is really bothering you, in the meantime if you load the script it the <head> it should resolve it. We're working on an alternate version as well that has fewer customization options but loads faster and presents a separate stylesheet, when that's out everything will be instant.\n. This should be resolved now - we are now loading from a much quicker CDN and the flicker won't happen anymore. We do still have allowing the fonts to be loaded by the user on our roadmap, but at the moment we are hosting on cloudflare, which is likely even quicker than loading locally and should solve this issue :grinning: \n. I don't like the pattern of putting css or js info into html tags, but I do know that a lot of people do like it (angular, bootstrap, etc) -- anyone else have thoughts on this?\n. There are a number of other ways to do it. One would be instantiating the share button on each post page and rendering the data into the javascript instantiation block. Another would be pulling the text you need from where is is rendered at runtime like this:\njs\n$('.button').share({ title: $('.title').text() });\nI generally agree that allowing the user to choose is a good option, and this will almost certainly be merged, but that won't change the fact that I don't like this pattern, or any pattern that mixes up html with javascript :smile: \n. Yeah, definitely true. I'm working on a way to slim down the options as much as possible, externalize stylesheets, and boost the load time, but have been fighting cross-browser rendering. I can put what I have up on a branch if you want\n. Good call. Seems like this would be the best way to do it - since this is your idea, want to put in a pull request to implement it? If not, we can grab it :grinning: \n. :+1: \n. Looks good, thanks @pasine!\n. This doesn't even make sense to me. The logic for this is here -- it should only be set to \"Share\" if opts.text is false or undefined. Testing it quickly, it appears as if empty string is a falsey value where if you even set it as a single space, it works. Weird.\nAnother issue I found here is that the popup does not auto-center when you change the text. This could be a tough calculation, but should be worked out.\nI'll get in a patch for at least the first issue today and report back here.\n. Awesome - thanks to @tmilewski for closing this one out\n. I'll mock something today or tomorrow :octopus: \n. Good catch, I'll have this patched shortly\n. I'll check this out today. One suggestion we've had is to balance it out with an email button on the other side...\n. I'm sorry, I haven't yet. I promise I haven't forgotten, just busy this week. I'll get to it as soon as I can!\n. Pulled this commit into #53 and added some more stuff, closing this PR, but it's contents will still be merged via #53! Thanks so much @devknoll for excellent work here.\n. I'm not seeing this issue - any particular steps I could take to reproduce?\n. Are you able to reproduce this in incognito in chrome? It might be an extension interfering...\n. No worries - thanks for keeping an eye out, and hope you can find the whack plugin!\n. It's on my list, but is a lot of work to cross-browser test everything up. Interested in helping out with this?\n. Is it that you are morally opposed to coffeescript, or that you can't figure out what's going on in the source?\n. I suppose. The two languages are very similar, and the source here is fairly short and simple, so it doesn't seem to me like it would be difficult to make changes. But of course it's your time and your choice! As soon as we can finish this, I'll notify and close out the issue : )\n. :open_mouth: :confetti_ball: \n. Perfect, this looks great - thank you @brunolazzaro! A couple more things, and this should be ready to merge:\n- Squash those two commits together (ref)\n- Could you use present imperative tense for the commit messages? It's what we've been using for all commits in this repo so far, just trying to keep it consistent. So for example, it would be \"center twitter and google+ popups\"\n- Could you rebase this on master? It's not totally caught up to the current head.\n- If you add the words closes #33 to the bottom of the pull request text, it will auto-close the issue when merged :smile: \n. It looks like something went wrong with your rebase. To do this right, you'll want to add this repo as an upstream, fetch, then rebase master. If it comes out right, it should be just your one commit in the pull request : )\n. Perfect, looks great. Merge coming soon : )\n. Thanks @girasquid!\n. Hey @EXFS, any update here? I'm going to close the issue since this is more of a request for us to help debug your page than an issue with share button as far as we are aware, but discussion is still welcome, and if this does end up being an issue with share-button I'll re-open it :grinning: \n. Duplicate of #32 - we are working on this one!\n. I've gotta agree with this, I don't think we should support this option. If you'd like to fork the project and add it yourself, you are welcome to do this, but I don't think opening the popup over the button itself is something we'll support here.\nGoing to close this issue, but discussion is still welcome!\n. You're definitely right, there hasn't been a release tagged that includes them yet. Sorry -- this is because we're working on some other features we'd like to include in the next release. But to be fair, there's no reason not to push incremental releases as well. I'll get one pushed up now and fix this :grinning: \n. You are definitely right, we are working with weloveiconfonts to see if we can resolve this, and also on an option that bundles in the fonts locally. Thanks for calling this one out though, and I promise it's in the pipeline!\n. This seems like a firefox bug rather than an issue with our css, to be honest. I don't think that kind of one pixel strip on an element that's both hidden and scaled away from that location is something you can fix with css, unless it's some sort of ugly workaround to firefox's bug.\nThanks for having a sharp eye and pointing this out (and it would be awesome if you could figure out how to fix it for sure), but I'm going to mark this low priority for now just to make sure we have our issues in order :grinning: \n. Woah, that is super weird. There's gotta be something going on there... have you cleared your cache etc? We are loading icons such that they should be working in ff6 without issue.\nWe'll check this out though and see if we can reproduce. Until then enjoy the abstract art version of the button, hah. Someday that might be worth millions :wink: \n. Hey @stalluri!\nIt seems like you are new to github -- welcome! Just as a general tip, it's a good idea to use the title of the issue as a short summary of what the problem is, and use the description to add more details on your request.\nIt's also a good idea to look through the issues or search the repo using the search bar up top to see if someone has already filed a matching issue. In this case you might have found https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/22, which addresses the same thing.\nI'm not totally clear on what you mean with the bit.ly link piece, but perhaps you can comment on #22 and add some more feedback there. I'm going to close out this issue though, as it's a duplicate.\n. Yeah, I don't think that's been dealt with here, the colors would need to change slightly\n. Hey, sorry this has not been merged yet. We're working on a way to make this totally configurable still. If you want to use it, feel free to grab the files from this pull request though!\n. Remove the facebook app_id and it will work. Read the docs rather than just copy/pasting our demo page!\n. Thanks @vadakkan - sorry it's taking a while. Really our goal is to have you be able to choose which networks you want to include, but this is a fairly complex feature so it's taking a bit. If you want to get your hands on this right now, you can pull down the branch and use the code there, it does work fine :grinning: \n. You can always overwrite the share text if you want as well: https://github.com/carrot/share-button#options\n. You'd have to manually grab the title to do this. You could get it with something like this, with jquery:\njs\n$('title').text()\nThe reason your code there doesn't work as expected is because you are passing through a string, so it just comes back as a string.\n. @rudemex good catch, you're right. We're taking a look at this now, it should be resolved soon!\nTambi\u00e9n puede responder en espa\u00f1ol si es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil : )\n. @rudemex si, gracias por encontrar y publicar esto. Hemos estado haciendo cambios en la prestaci\u00f3n de los iconos para aumentar la velocidad -- esto fue un error y estamos arreglando pronto!\n. This should be resolved as of v0.0.6 which was just pushed :smile: \n. We need these font assets to be in the repo rather that privately served. I can add to the build task so that it deploys with a local config file. But PRs like this don't really tell us anything because you made all the changes to a private file and just changed the reference...\n. I wonder if this is the best way to version - I feel like we could get up to v45 quickly at this rate. What was actually changed with the font files?\n. Still not seeing them functional on sharebutton.co - if we merged you're saying it would be fixed though?\n. I know you are busy this week @tmilewski but let me know if there's any update here when you are freed up again :grinning: \n. I kind of like having lato in there for the design aspect :grinning: \n. @assassinateur if you want to replace the font and icons, at this point it might be a good idea to fork this project. we try to make it as flexible as we can, but being able to swap out the icon set and fonts is a little beyond scope\n. I understand the concern and desire to eliminate, but tbh the google fonts version looks vastly better still in my eyes. Like huge amounts. Maybe we could make it optional?\n. The https thing isn't an issue, if you look at the code above protocol is an option\n. @jgclifton directly above your comment :grinning: \n. I would be totally ok with this if the default were set to true :grinning: \n. Hey @pixeline -- thanks for pointing this out, we are working on resolving it. For now we're going to use #55 to ref this issue, but I'll let you know as soon as it's closed out!\n. I have no idea, have not used it in this environment. Are you seeing any errors in the console? I can help best with a little more context of what's going wrong...\n. Ok, perhaps you can expand the security policy to allow scripts from facebook, or include that separately and remove it from the plugin like you did? It works perfectly without the facebook SDK, just an additional option if needed.\nIf this is resolved though you can close out the issue!\n. Just going to close this for now, unless there is an update. It's been inactive for almost a month\n. ping @tmilewski \n. Great suggestion, agreed. Would you be interested in putting in a pull request to make this change? It should be a fairly simple one, and would be a good way to get involved :grinning: \n. I'm sorry, I don't use wordpress so I can't really help with this one, but hopefully someone else will be able to. I'm going to close this issue since it's more of a request for help than an issue with the script, but feel free to continue discussion here!\n. What do you need python for? And coffeescript is included in the dependencies, if I'm not mistaken...\n. Hmm. you're on windows?\n. Ah, you're right. Ok so to run cake, coffee is a dependency - should have put that in, sorry! The python thing is only an issue on windows, I'm quite sure about that one. Could you modify it so that it says \"windows only\" for the python piece (just to not confuse people who arent on windows), then I'll merge?\n. Yup!\n. Hey Dan,\nThis looks fantastic - thanks so much for the contribution! Love to see you getting this code in. Just a couple nitpicky commit things:\n1. Remove the installation instructions commit from this PR, it's part of a separate issue\n2. We prefer commits in present imperative tense, so it would be \"create opengraph and twitter card fallbacks\"\n3. You can actually close out the issue you opened from the commit using closes #X, so your commit could read create opengraph and twitter card fallbacks, closes #61\n4. Squash the console.log remove commit into the previous commit, just for cleanliness :grinning: \n. Perfect, thanks again Dan for the hard work getting this in order!\n. Just make sure to rebase off master for the next pull request now that this has been merged :smile: \n. :+1: \n. Perfect, well done :clap: \n. Awesome! Thanks for your contributions so far, and looking forward to it :grinning: \n. Sounds like a good addition - any interest in pull requesting this in and claiming credit for the change? :grinning: \n. Awesome, thanks - keep us updated!\n. Hey @CoLzAk - we don't manually minify, it's done through UglifyJS, a very popular and widely used javascript minifier which uses the \"bang style\" for IIFE's as described in your issue. What you are describing here is actually an issue with assetic's apparent incompatibility with UglifyJS, which is a bug that should be filed in assetic's repo rather than here.\n. Rebase on master?\n. :tada: \n. Hey @seanlinsley, this looks great, I'd say good for merge. I think perhaps we should also include auto-pulling of certain data attributes as a part of the plugin itself (with this method as a way to overwrite that functionality if you wanted). We had a PR open to do this before but never quite got around to it. Any thoughts on this @tmilewski?\n. :+1: on this from me\n. Could you do a little more investigation and see if you can figure out what's causing this? We can't spend our time debugging meteor apps, but if you can find the portion of share-button that's causing a conflict it would be easier for us to start narrowing down what the issue is. \n. Ok, going to close this until it is once again relevant and/or you can find the issue!\n. No idea. What browser/os are you using? Have you tried it in incognito mode to make sure it's not an extension interfering if you are on chrome? It's being used in many places right now and working fine, so I feel like it's almost certainly an issue with your setup rather than the code.\n. Yeah I'm sorry, I wish I could help more but there is not enough information here for me to debug it yet. If you post anything else you find out I'll see if I can pick out what the issue is\n. I thought it was just the presence of #fb-root that was needed for initializing the facebook sdk... does it also need content?\n. This was just merged and should be fixed now. Thanks guys!\n. Remove the facebook app_id from the options. You probably copy-pasted the example from our example page and it uses our facebook application id. You don't need an app id for it to work, that's just an option you can use to get tighter fb integration. You can find all this info in the docs if you take a moment to scan them over :grinning: \n. No problem, if I had a dollar for every person who has made that same mistake and posted slash emailed me that problem I would... well, probably have like 10 more dollars. But either way you are certainly not the first person so no worries.\n. Can you please be more specific with what the error is, and when it occurs?\n. Ok, do you think those updates will solve this issue? Are you guys working with the script from master?\n. Good catch! Want to submit a pull request to update the readme?\n. Could you post a screenshot so we can see what you mean?\n. There is not, but you can change it yourself just by writing css :grinning: \n. I'm leaning toward saying anything that can be styled with css should be...\n. This shouldn't be happening, if so it's an issue with the browser not cacheing/rendering things too slowly. Although I recall this happening with older versions, I'm unable to replicate it with the most recent one.\n. Could you dig a little deeper here for me? Examples of things you could do to help with this:\n- Comment the axis typography mixin out and see if that fixes it, narrowing down what exactly is causing the issue\n- Inspect the source to see if the share-button css is not already applied last\nDebugging ftw! I'm closing this issue as it's a personal one and not a problem with share button but we can keep discussing it here.\n. Ok, keep digging and see if you can pinpoint the issue. Keep narrowing it down. This is almost certainly not an issue with share-button, it's likely an issue with global css styles leaking into the button, which is something we can't prevent from happening.\n. :tada: good work!\n. You can select it with css and change the size...\n. You can use the inspector in any web browser to view the underlying html and css on a page in order to be able to create a css selector.\ncss\n.share-button label {\n  font-size: 5em;\n}\n. - You can change the title using the title attribute in the configuration options.\n- You can change the size using the code I produced above\n- You can change the position using css on your website, this plugin just produces a button, it doesn't place the button where you want it within your site automatically.\nI'm really sorry, but we cannot debug your personal site here, issues are for discussing problems or requested features for this plugin. It seems like your issue is that you are having trouble using css and javascript and/or understanding the documentation, which isn't something we can provide further assistance with. There are many resources you can find on the web that will help you to learn more about css and javascript, and the documentation in this repo will help you to use share-button the way you want if you read it through.\n. Hey @Ljanmi - I'm really sorry but like I said before we can't debug your site for you. If you are having an issue with the css, you can use the inspector in your browser to investigate and debug the problem. In this case you probably need a more specific selector to override. Again, this is not an issue with share-button, it's an issue on your site, and we simply don't have time to debug everyone's personal stuff.\n. That's the best part about open source, you can fork a project and make any changes you want. You can also submit your changes back to the original repo with a pull request and if they are good they will probably be pulled in.\nWhen working with open source projects, it's important to keep in mind that we are working to provide this to you for free, and in addition offering free support for it. If it were a paid service, you would be more entitled to ask for personal support and changes that you specifically want, but the fact is that this is a collaborative open source project. If you think you'd like to make changes to this plugin, please do so and we'd be happy to review them. And even if we don't accept them, you can still continue to use your own forked version!\nAlso, I can't help but note that while you claim the opposite, you are actually the only one complaining. We have no other open issues and hundreds of people happily using this code.\n. Yeah I like this direction. I think removing as much css as we can is probably the right way to go.\n. Wow, that's really a bad one, thanks for catching that. I think @tmilewski would know how to fix this particular one best\n. Very gracefully handled @tmilewski - no need for the extra snark in your issues @devonmather, we're here to help you out.\n. Yeah, sorry about that! Lots of changes. This started out as more of a drop-in solution, but as it's picked up and people have wanted more and more customization we've been moving towards making it a little more flexible :grinning: \n. :+1: \n. Hi @martinbetz!\nSo share button is not intended for this purpose and should not be used for it. Usually the best way to keep blog entries in sync with facebook or twitter is by using a different tool for that purpose. Popular blogging systems like tumblr and wordpress have this functionality built in, but I assume since you are talking about python here you are building one from scratch (any reason not to use something like tumblr? It's fully themeable, has a community and support for a lot of tools for publishing, can support custom domains, and is free). If that is the case, maybe a tool like networkedblogs would help to auto-publish your posts, assuming you have an rss feed set up.\nGood luck!\n. You do not want to use a javascript library for this task - don't do this or you will be looking in the wrong place. You want to either use a library that auths with facebook and can post to it from flask, or a library that will listen on your rss feed and sync it like that, like the one I posted above.\n. Oh hi Sacha!\nSo more or less the entire point of this plugin is to not have the social buttons appear inline, because it takes up a lot more space that way, and can't be optimized to load quicker by only loading more expensive pieces when the user has an intent to share (aka when they click share). So I don't see this becoming a feature here specifically, although I do think that would be a nice fork.\nThere's also mojotech's social builder, crafted lovingly by the amazing @samccone, which I think is closer to fitting the style you're thinking about.\n. Would love to see you take a stab at it! Open source ftw : )\n. Can you post more information about how you are trying to make this work?\n. In your browser console, can you access window.Share?\n. Oh never mind, I see the issue, that was a silly question for me to ask. You aren't actually bringing it in to your script, which is why it's not there. At the top where you define the libs you want to use, you only actually name the ring parameter. You need to add a second param to that function and call it Share in order to actually use what share-button exports. Since you are using requirejs, it's not attached to any global namespace, you need to manage it manually.\nTo be extra clear, here's what code you have:\njs\ndefine([\n    'ring',\n    'libs/share.min'\n], function (ring) {\nAnd this is the code you need:\njs\ndefine([\n    'ring',\n    'libs/share.min'\n], function (ring, Share) {\n.

Sweet -- do you see why this is the case though? If you do understand this, it will make it much easier for you to use other libraries as well. With require (or any other module loader), rather than having everything that's exported attach to window, you manually manage the exports within the scopes you need. This is a good thing, and is how it should be, but it requires a slightly different mindset from the standard drop a script tag and attach everything to window approach.\n. If you want to use a custom facebook app id, the facebook sdk needs to be loaded - the fb_root stuff is in their documentation.\n. No, that would remove most of the utility of the share button, stripping it to just essentially a button with a click handler. If you want to write your own custom css fully from scratch, I'd recommend forking the project. If you just want to modify some of our styles, you can override them (all styles here)\n. Hey @raffone -- sorry for the late response, but in general I think you're right here. I'm going to take a look at this over the next week or two and see if I can make custom styling much easier and potentially take your suggestion and include an option to strip all css, because it really is very painful at the moment to customize the appearance.\n. We're happy to review pull requests for this stuff! I haven't really had time to audit this project in a couple months, but hoping to come back to it eventually and overhaul stuff like this.\n. Hey @ilompf - have you made sure that the issue is with the share button plugin rather than your generateDeepLink() function? If you log out the results of that function above the call to share button you should see this. As long as that function returns a string, the string should be included. Functions aren't treated any differently.\n. Hi @ilompf -- sorry for the delay in getting back to you here! I just tested it with the exact link that you provided as a string inputting into the description field for email, and it worked perfectly fine. Here's a jsfiddle reproduction:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/58CSA/\nIt seems like the issue is likely with the function you are using to generate the link as mentioned earlier, or that there's something else on your site interfering with the way that share button operates. This sounds like a difficult issue, but based on this reproduction I don't think it's an issue with share button.\n. Yup, right in this config options: ui.icon_font can be set to false.\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/Configuration-Options\n. Yep, I'm good with this. I might make it a colon rather than a newline though, I don't think newlines work like this in email bodies across all clients. Want to put in a PR for this?\n. https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L195 :grinning: \n. Perhaps something like this?\ncoffee\nbody: \"#{@config.networks.email.description} -- #{@config.url}\"\n. Looks good to me - it's probably because of an updated version of umd if I had to guess, which should be fine. Any thoughts on this @tmilewski?\n. Thanks @LCMiller :grinning: - so glad its working well for you!\nIt's something we are working on, but passively. This plugin is pretty set on a slim and focused experience rather than having a bajillion buttons for every network imaginable. We don't currently have a linkedin option, but it's something we are thinking about and happy to look over contributions for.\nI'm going to close this issue since it's already here https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/96 but happy to continue discussing if you want!\n. :+1: sorry about the brief outage!\n. Hi @elsondinardo -- we don't use magento, so it's unlikely that we're going to do this, but this plugin is open source and we'd love to have you take it on!\n. If we did this, there would be no point to having a button at all, if you didn't have to click it. This kind of change would be better fit to a fork of the project that doesn't include a button.\nWe included the button on purpose to make it lighter on the page, take up less space, and load faster, since they don't load unless it's opened.\n. Good call, thanks @slang800 :+1: \n. Hey @leeroyrose -- you want to make your changes in the source file rather than the build file is possible. You can then run cake build to build the project. Refer here for instructions on contributing.\nIt would also be helpful if you included a screenshot of how this looks! But thank you so much for working on this and contributing, we really do appreciate it. Looking forward to getting this merged after a few updates :grinning: \n. Of course! I'm the one who owes you a thanks though for jumping in and contributing :grinning: \nIf there's anything I can help with or advise on just ping here!\n. Hey @1parkplace -- sorry for the late response (was away this weekend) and glad you managed to work this out! This is a solid suggestion, would you be interested in putting in a pull request to add this to the readme?\n. This is not currently an option. I don't see it as an issue worth fixing personally, as you click on the button then select whichever social network you want to share on. It's not like people are more likely to click the left, right or middle one, they click on the one they want to use. We'd be happy to look over a pull request if you want to take stab at implementing this though!\n. Definitely, good catches here. Would you be interested in contributing fixes to these things? They are fairly straightforward and we love to get people involved :grinning: \n. Looks great, thanks so much! Just waiting on @tmilewski's approval and this should be merged up. Closing this issue as we have the pull request open now. :tada: \n. Looks good to me :+1: \n. Yeah I agree. The arrow was a casualty of making more networks available to add/remove from the popup. The logic to detect networks have been added/removed then position and color the arrow correctly seemed ridiculous. I liked it too though and would like to get it added back in at some point.\n. You can see the styles that are generated here - if you just write css that overrides these styles, it will work fine :grinning: \n. @tmilewski critical\n. :+1: \n. I feel like most people haven't had issues integrating it into existing layouts to be honest. What is the exact issue you're having?\nWhat you're describing sounds like it would be more flexible for sure, but the point of this plugin is for it to work well and look good out of the box. What you're describing is essentially a js plugin that puts an active class on when you click an element, then requires you to do the rest of the customization yourself...\n. Yeah it seems like you should be writing your own code to do this to be honest. What you want is an entirely custom element, not this plugin which is a self-contained share button.\nAlso it helps a lot to use floats with clearfixed containers over inline block. This eliminates some weird spacing issues and increases compatibility with older browsers :grinning: \n. You certainly could, fork away! That's what open source is all about.\n. I don't think changing this one to a web component is the way to go, so having an \"upgrade path\" was not even on my mind. But I'd be happy to link to a web component fork someone made in the readme! Either way if this is something you are serious about let's open that up in a new issue if you want to talk about it.\nThis issue I'm going to close it out, because it's asking for too fundamental of a change from what this plugin is, but I support the idea and again I think a fork or another library that has that functionality would be worth exploring :grinning: \n. I don't see us adding this until we can roll out the enable/disable network feature in a more intuitive manner, tbh. But happy to review a pull request if you'd like to jump in!\n. I'd give this a :+1: -- if @tmilewski agrees I'd say let's merge up.\n. We moved away from jquery a while ago as we don't want to lock in to it for people that don't use it. The good news is that it's pretty easy to convert a jquery collection to a dom collection using toArray. Perhaps we should include this in the docs rather than include a special case for jquery? If we allow jquery, who's to say we shouldn't also have special handling for any other dom selection library that exists or comes out in the future?\n. @patrick91 thanks for the contribution! It looks like it only checks the right side, were you planning on adding checks for left, top, and bottom as well?\n. Definitely, if we're pulling this in for everyone we'll need that :grinning: \n. :two_men_holding_hands: \n. This is a massive change in the design of the project. The whole point of the button is to compact the shares and delay the loading of all that stuff until a person actually wants to share. If you don't need to click the button, why have a button in the first place, right? So now that the button has been stripped out, it's just a row of customizable share icons, which is a different project.\nYou are welcome to do this if you'd like, but it would be better as a fork than an option in this project, since the button is the entire point :grinning: Thank you for the feedback though, and still very much open to discussion even though I am going to close this issue.\n. Yeah, I see what you are saying for sure. But the entire point of this project is to have it require an additional click. Our general view on this is that if people want to share your page, they will do so, and we trade an additional click for the following benefits: \n- If you have a button that says \"SHARE\" in clear capital letters, it seems counter-intuitive to me that someone would like your content enough to share it, intend to share it by clicking that button, then once they see the networks go \"Shit I have to click again? This is way too much work, fuck it\" and not share the page.\n- A bunch of share buttons on a page is spammy-looking and visually distracting. Compressing them into a button frees up visual real estate on your page and makes it look more elegant and less spammy.\n- When you hide the networks behind a button, you can load the page much quicker, as mentioned previously, and load less of the networks' tracking scripts and other bullshit without the user intending for that to happen.\nThese are totally opinions backed by zero research at all. If someone did research on this, it would be awesome, I'd be interested to see the result. But with all that being said, using this library is a trade-off -- one some people are willing to make and others are not. For those who are not, they typically choose not to use this library. But we are, which is why we made and use it.\n. Sure -- would definitely be interested to see the result! There are certainly plenty of factors that should be taken into account in such a test, but even a rough measure would be interesting.\n. :+1: \n. I don't see why that wouldn't work, that's just javascript, has nothing to do with this plugin...\n. You can override these styles to customize. There are no inline styles added by js, they are all css and can be overridden :grinning: \n. Any objections? If not I'll merge this end of today\n. Screenshot/gif?\n. This looks pretty good to me. @tmilewski thoughts? Also do we have support for enabling/disabling specific networks? the number of buttons here is getting pretty high\n. Agreed, I think this should definitely be a feature\n. Yeah, I think this is actually a limitation of mailto links. I did a bunch of research into this a while back, and while it's possible to get newlines to render in a couple of random email clients if they are escaped, most of them will not render a newline from a mailto link.\nThis is rather unfortunate, but I would recommend simply using a one liner or a single paragraph for the email share because of this :confused: \n. If I'm not mistaken, theres a good reason why we encode the data first. @tmilewski would probably be able to tell you more about this.\nIt might work fine in whatever email client you are opening it in at the moment, but I definitely recall testing newlines in a bunch of different email clients and having it not work in many of them. If you have tested across a wide range and it works in all of them, a lot of progress must have been made and that's great.\nEither way, I'll have to look into encoding and mailto links to see if it's safe enough across clients to create an exception for this property.\n. Hi @treeskelt -- I'm really sorry but I'm traveling for an extended period of time at the moment and am not able to continue being vigilant with maintenance for this library until I get back. Perhaps someone else from @carrot/devs would be able to help out!\n. Yeah this depends on whether each individual network provides a callback. As we add more networks, this will become difficult to make consistent as a feature. If you could look into the support other networks have for a post-share callback and post it here, that would help a ton!\n. Reddit background color is too light. Otherwise, looking fresh!\n. ",

So you mean an additional square that would copy a link that the user could paste to a friend or in a different site?\n. @CrashMan054 unfortunately, most effective click-to-copy tools out there are written using flash and we really don't want to add anymore external dependencies to this project (ie. a .swf file). \nNow, there may be some other creative solutions to get around this, but unfortunately it's not on our roadmap at this time. As usual, we're open to pull-requests if you were feeling ambitious and if we do decide to add this feature in the future, I'll be sure to open this ticket back up and ping you. \n. gorgeous stuff - nice work @devknoll \n. hubspot has a project called https://github.com/HubSpot/tether that seems like it solves the issue you're running into. Might be worth trying to implement, but I'm not sure if it adds unnecessary overhead. \n. so cool. thanks @carlsednaoui \n. @yoneth are you using the most recent release v0.1.1? we've run into that in the past, but I believe we've corrected the issue. If you're still seeing it on this newest version, we'll have to dig a bit deeper\n. @vigna we don't have any fix date. we're able to work on these projects when we find/make time, but unfortunately at this time we've prioritized other projects. we welcome any pull requests, however. \n. @marvoh I don't believe there is anyway to share a piece of content from a website to instagram. do you know of any technique? \n. i'm going to close this for now. if you do have a technique or one comes along, feel free to reopen @marvoh \n. yes, have a look at the readme's \"public api\" section - the documentation to do what you're asking is there.\njs\nvar share = new Share(\".share-button\");\nshare.close();\n. @hhsnopek made this [wip] and just remove and ping @tmilewski when its ready to be reviewed/merged\n. @hhsnopek did phantomjs take that screenshot :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ? \n. what's next guys?\n. it's crap. start over\n. :raised_hands: :shipit: :raised_hands: \n. @brandones surprisingly enough, this is actually against our original intention of the share-button. we were tired of the spattered share buttons one all of these sites and wanted to see if we could make a little cleaner and more concise solution to the sharing problem. \nthat said, we don't deny that there are use-cases out there to display the buttons on their own. while we may not prioritize this feature with a config option right now, you may realize you can probably still accomplish this effect. by using the share.open() function in the public api you could reveal the network buttons and then use CSS to remove the \"share\" button itself. \n. much appreciated @brandones. I'm sure others will find this helpful\n. @paramsinghvc can you share the URL that's being generated please? \n. @arisAlexis would you be willing to add a PR with the doc update?\n. I'm thinking if we have your solution in the form of a PR - it'll help us investigate. i apologize for the delay, however, we just have not had enough time to dedicate to addressing each issue lately. \n. https://github.com/carrot/share-button-bower\n. you're not doing anything with the config variable at all. you need to pass that to the new ShareButton. I suggest you read the documentation a bit more thoroughly. good luck\n. please refer to the contributing.md guideline - https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#filing-issues\n. @neuropass if you're willing to help slim it down - we'd very likely be open to a PR\n. @neuropass you'll have to show me where were are billing it as \"no overhead etc etc\". we don't use that language in the readme anywhere. if i had to guess you're referring to where we say \"Simple, light, flexible, and good-looking share button\" - which I don't feel is a stretch. \nI agree in principle the Lato font is not required. Perhaps we'll make it optional someday. We'll be sure to ping you if we do end up addressing your concerns in the future.\n. @jchatard willing to submit a pull request to fix this?\n. all, we may not be able to look into solving this for weeks. unfortunately, this project is low on our priority list and we'll have to rely on the community if there's going to be an immediate solution. \n.

Correct, but what's the actual issue that's happening on localhost?\n\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2014 at 12:01 PM, SalemSaiid notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n127.0.0.1\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/pull/53#issuecomment-39029227\n. @SalemSaiid Yes, this expected functionality and none of what you're presenting is an issue with this library. The app_id that you are utilizing is meant for sharebutton.co only. It will not work for any domains other than that one regardless as to whether they are locally hosted or a live site.\n\nRead the both our documentation as well as the Facebook's documentation which may be found at https://developers.facebook.com/.\nAlso, please note that the Cannot call method 'shift' of null error occurs in all.js which is a file that the Facebook JS SDK injects into your HTML. We have zero control over that file.\nAfter you've correctly implemented the share per both ours and Facebook's documentation, if you find any errors please open a new issue as you've attached this to a completely unrelated ticket.\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/carrot/share-button/tree/additional-services\n. The reason is that the title param is already present in what's sent to, say, Facebook. This is for alternate content.\n. Hey @rudemex!\nI appreciate your interest in this library and the fonts that you provided. However, I'm not exactly aware of the problem that you're presenting. \nWe're serving fonts in a cross-browser compatible way which is supported by the following browsers:\n- Internet Explorer: 4+\n- Firefox: 3.5+\n- Safari: 3.1+\n- Chrome: 0.3+\n- Opera: 9+\nIf you're experiencing issues surrounding the library, feel free to open another issue. Please include some more insight into how we might go about recreating it.\nThanks again!\n. The files are completely public and until the files are added to the repo, this is our only option.\n. @jenius The fonts now work in all instances and browsers. There are some issues with IE but that's not a result of the fonts. They are in-fact loading as they should.\nI agree that the versioning is somewhat odd. The reason that I did it that way was so that if we need to implement a breaking font change we could. Now that the remote fonts are in a good place, I don't see this number rising without an actual feature commit. (ie: adding a new social network)\nI've packaged up each remote font version and put a changelog in the readme along with download links. Local fonts can (and should) be handled differently.\n. @jenius While I do like the font and, I'll be the first to admit, it is rather light, I do see a fundamental issue with its presence in the library. I don't believe that it aligns with the goals of the project.\nOn top of that, it's another two requests on every page load for a rather small style difference. IMHO.\nUsing Google Fonts:\n\nUsing System Fonts:\n\n. @jgclifton The main issue is local testing and development. In local development, // maps to file://.\n. Any update on this @vikask? Would like to close this out.\n. @josephdburdick What version are you using?\n. @josephdburdick Make sure to use this new version: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.0.6\n. @dealingwith FYI: We just recently pushed a heavily updated breaking version of the library to master.\nWhile I agree with your assessment that using \"sharer.php\" would be more consistent with the other networks, it's not the recommended approach by Facebook.\nIn the new version (v0.1.0), the networks are handled differently (not through if statements) which certainly cleans things up a bit. As we push to add more networks (and more available configuration), I don't expect all networks to follow the same methodology. I feel that pushing for consistency across all networks is a zero-sum game. Please let me know how you feel about the new approach used in the links below:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L127\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L152\n. @dealingwith For a little background, sharer.php is actually older than FB.ui and once FB.ui came out, all references to sharer.php disappeared in the docs. People kept using it including, as far as I saw, many major news sites. \nA while back, we at Carrot, as a Facebook Preferred Marketing Developer, were able to ask Facebook whether or not there was an EOL on the sharer.php. We didn't receive an EOL but they did try to discourage us from using it.\nThat said, it appears to be back and that's great! The problem that remains, in the context of this plugin, is that it would alter the expected functionality. Per this plugin, users expect to be able to dynamically set the parameters they want to pass to each social network whereas sharer.php relies solely on Open Graph tags.\nI've added the ability to use the sharer.php functionality as I like that it removes the Facebook JS SDK dependency, but it is disabled by default.\nSee: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/commit/ec3b825bcb2986b19c719af6ac082566f9f628a4#diff-0730bb7c2e8f9ea2438b52e419dd86c9R73\nLet me know what you think!\n. @dealingwith I hope so as well. Here's the new release: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.1.1\n. Interesting, I'll check this out. Thanks!\n. @jenius rebased on master\n. Confirmed: Works in IE9/10\n. Thanks for the bug. Once implemented, albeit a breaking update, this will be fixed with #69.\n. Merged #69. Should fix your issue!\n. Thanks @seanlinsley! Before we merge this in, can you go ahead and compile the CoffeeScript so that the PR also includes the compiled JS versions?\n@jenius I'm not against it but I feel that, with the inclusion of this PR, the library provides users a plethora of options to handle config values. I don't know. I'd love to have more people's opinions on this one. What do you think @seanlinsley?\n. @seanlinsley just check to ensure that each param hasn't already been encoded and you have my :+1:!

Thanks!\n. @tolord @hendrikbeck What version of the button are you using?\n. @hendrikbeck The latest \"released\" version is v0.1.1. Master is a few commits beyond that. Let me know if that solves your problem.\n. @hendrikbeck Interesting, what options are you using when configuring the button?\n. Outside of the share button, have you already inserted the Facebook JS SDK?\n\nCurrently, the only thing that enabled: true/false controls is whether or not the JS SDK is dynamically inserted into the DOM.\nWhen true it runs the following:\n``` coffeescript\nCoffeeScript\ninject_facebook_sdk: ->\n    if !window.FB && @config.networks.facebook.app_id && !@el.body.querySelector('#fb-root')\n      script      = document.createElement(\"script\")\n      script.text = \"window.fbAsyncInit=function(){FB.init({appId:'#{@config.networks.facebook.app_id}',status:true,xfbml:true})};(function(e,t,n){var r,i=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];if(e.getElementById(n)){return}r=e.createElement(t);r.id=n;r.src='#{@config.protocol}connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';i.parentNode.insertBefore(r,i)})(document,'script','facebook-jssdk')\"\n  @el.body.innerHTML += \"<div id='fb-root'></div>\"\n  @el.body.appendChild(script)\n\n```\njavascript\n// JavaScript\n  Share.prototype.inject_facebook_sdk = function() {\n    var script;\n    if (!window.FB && this.config.networks.facebook.app_id && !this.el.body.querySelector('#fb-root')) {\n      script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n      script.text = \"window.fbAsyncInit=function(){FB.init({appId:'\" + this.config.networks.facebook.app_id + \"',status:true,xfbml:true})};(function(e,t,n){var r,i=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];if(e.getElementById(n)){return}r=e.createElement(t);r.id=n;r.src='\" + this.config.protocol + \"connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';i.parentNode.insertBefore(r,i)})(document,'script','facebook-jssdk')\";\n      this.el.body.innerHTML += \"<div id='fb-root'></div>\";\n      return this.el.body.appendChild(script);\n    }\n  };\n. It shouldn't. I'm just trying to narrow down the possibilities. If you could try removing it and seeing if that works, that'd be a huge help.\nSide note for @jenius: We might want to check whether or not #fb-root has content rather than if it simply exists.\n. @jenius You're correct. \nIf the user uses the FB SDK outside of the share button they are required to include the FB JS SDK and #fb-root. Currently, we're checking if #fb-root exists and not if it has content. The problem is that this leaves us open to the possibility that the FB JS SDK wasn't ever initialized. This could be due to developer error, etc. Regardless, it means that the FB portion of the share button won't work.\nBy checking that #fb-root has content, we ensure that (along with window.FB) it was successfully initialized.\n. @hendrikbeck That does help out! Two questions probably I should have asked earlier:\n1) What browser?\n2) When you didn't have <div id=\"fb-root\"></div> added in there manually, was one added automatically via the share button? In addition to that, did it add the Javascript for the async Facebook JS SDK?\n. @inklingsolutions You're going to have to use master at this point. The reason is that we haven't (intentionally) created a release of master with this feature yet. Sorry for the confusion.\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/tree/master/build\n. https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.1.2\n. Thanks a lot!\nCould you include the compiled .js files? Once they're in there, I'll go ahead and merge.\nThanks again!\n. @jenius A new release needs to be pushed. Master is a few updates out of date with releases.\n. @Madebym Sorry for the delay. Are you using an older version? This was fixed in a newer version.\n. I'm torn between putting this in the configs or putting CSS style-able attributes in the docs (including existing ones).\n. Cool, I was leaning that way as well.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. @jenius If you can think of any other ways to clean up/minimize this output... https://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/CSS-Styles\n. If you can rename the config to icon_font... I'll gladly go ahead and merge this.\nThanks a lot!\n. Thanks again!\n. Thank you for the issue, this has been fixed: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.4.1\n. @devonmather As of the other day, we've moved CSS out of the UI config.\nYou should be able to accomplish the same thing with the following:\n``` css\nshareButton label {\nbackground: #ef3b05;\n  color: #ffffff;\n}\n```\nMore info can be found here: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/CSS-Styles\n. The fallback is very similar to the Lato font-set. You have override the injected CSS with your own. \nMore info: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/CSS-Styles\n. Whoops! Thank you, sir!\n. You're able to disable the entypo from the configuration:\n``` js\nconfig = {\n  ui: {\n    icon_font: false\n  }\n}\nvar share = new Share('.share-button', config);\n```\nDoes this solve your issue?\n. Good looking out! Hopefully that solves the issue. One thing to keep in mind is that this is a later addition to the library. They might need to update for that feature.\n. I'm with @jenius on this one.\n. Thanks! This has been noted and I'm closing it in favor of #160 and a v1.0 release.\n. This may be related to your default mail client. What client opens up when you click the email button?\n. I just re-read your message, what's the URL in the new blank window?\n. What browser (and version) is this occurring in?\n. I don't know what you mean by \"the window with the odd URL is still open\". \nIt sounds like everything is working appropriately. It appears as if you don't have a default email client set on the one computer. We don't really have any control regarding that on our end.\n. Can't do much about that either. Users have the ability to set web email clients (such as GMail) to open in that window on mailto. Seeing as we can't detect what client they use, we can't close the window.\n. Do you happen to have a div with the ID #fb-root in your HTML? If the share button detects that, it doesn't add the SDK as it assumes that it's already been loaded.\n. Any chance you could post your HTML?\n. That's probably going to be your issue. You're going to have a few issues as this isn't a valid HTML document. Please make sure to include (at a minimum) html, head, and body tags. A doctype can't hurt either.\n. Hey @ahmetsali, \nShare Button doesn't support IE8 and, considering all of the backwards compatible code that we'd have to implement, we don't plan to support it in the future.\nYou're obviously more than welcome to fork the repository and have a go at it yourself.\nThanks!\n. \n. Considering the lack of updates, I'm going to assume that this was figured out.\n. Closing this per https://github.com/carrot/share-button/pull/107#issuecomment-51198696\n. querySelector and querySelectorAll return static NodeLists thus when new elements are introduced to the DOM, that match your selector, they won\u2019t be included (unless you re-query the DOM). That's why it is currently duplicated.\n. It's not just adding elements. Changes to existing DOM elements also apply.\n. IE9+ (IE9 is where the classList shim comes into play)\nOther \u2013 more modern \u2013 browsers should be pretty fine across the board. We've gone back a few versions but nothing super crazy.\n. Going to close this out. Please feel free to contribute a PR for a Magento extension.\n. Going to close this out. Please feel free to contribute a PR.\n. On it, thanks @1parkplace!\n. Closing this in favor of #121.\n. Closes #120 \n. Per RFC-3986, it should not encode % into %25.\n\nRef: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2\nHowever, encodeURIComponent takes care of this:\n\n. :+1: Merged! \nI'll be able to create a new release later tonight. Thanks!\n. I too like the arrow but making it work in all scenarios, short of being quite a bit of ongoing effort, isn't possible given the current state of the design and functionality. For example, in the situation when there's an even number of networks.\nI'm going to close this for now. If there comes a time where it makes sense design-wise, etc to add the arrow back in, we'll certainly do so.\nThanks!\n. Thanks!

Correct, but what's the actual issue that's happening on localhost?\n\nOn Sun, Mar 30, 2014 at 12:01 PM, SalemSaiid notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n127.0.0.1\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/pull/53#issuecomment-39029227\n. @SalemSaiid Yes, this expected functionality and none of what you're presenting is an issue with this library. The app_id that you are utilizing is meant for sharebutton.co only. It will not work for any domains other than that one regardless as to whether they are locally hosted or a live site.\n\nRead the both our documentation as well as the Facebook's documentation which may be found at https://developers.facebook.com/.\nAlso, please note that the Cannot call method 'shift' of null error occurs in all.js which is a file that the Facebook JS SDK injects into your HTML. We have zero control over that file.\nAfter you've correctly implemented the share per both ours and Facebook's documentation, if you find any errors please open a new issue as you've attached this to a completely unrelated ticket.\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/carrot/share-button/tree/additional-services\n. The reason is that the title param is already present in what's sent to, say, Facebook. This is for alternate content.\n. Hey @rudemex!\nI appreciate your interest in this library and the fonts that you provided. However, I'm not exactly aware of the problem that you're presenting. \nWe're serving fonts in a cross-browser compatible way which is supported by the following browsers:\n- Internet Explorer: 4+\n- Firefox: 3.5+\n- Safari: 3.1+\n- Chrome: 0.3+\n- Opera: 9+\nIf you're experiencing issues surrounding the library, feel free to open another issue. Please include some more insight into how we might go about recreating it.\nThanks again!\n. The files are completely public and until the files are added to the repo, this is our only option.\n. @jenius The fonts now work in all instances and browsers. There are some issues with IE but that's not a result of the fonts. They are in-fact loading as they should.\nI agree that the versioning is somewhat odd. The reason that I did it that way was so that if we need to implement a breaking font change we could. Now that the remote fonts are in a good place, I don't see this number rising without an actual feature commit. (ie: adding a new social network)\nI've packaged up each remote font version and put a changelog in the readme along with download links. Local fonts can (and should) be handled differently.\n. @jenius While I do like the font and, I'll be the first to admit, it is rather light, I do see a fundamental issue with its presence in the library. I don't believe that it aligns with the goals of the project.\nOn top of that, it's another two requests on every page load for a rather small style difference. IMHO.\nUsing Google Fonts:\n\nUsing System Fonts:\n\n. @jgclifton The main issue is local testing and development. In local development, // maps to file://.\n. Any update on this @vikask? Would like to close this out.\n. @josephdburdick What version are you using?\n. @josephdburdick Make sure to use this new version: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.0.6\n. @dealingwith FYI: We just recently pushed a heavily updated breaking version of the library to master.\nWhile I agree with your assessment that using \"sharer.php\" would be more consistent with the other networks, it's not the recommended approach by Facebook.\nIn the new version (v0.1.0), the networks are handled differently (not through if statements) which certainly cleans things up a bit. As we push to add more networks (and more available configuration), I don't expect all networks to follow the same methodology. I feel that pushing for consistency across all networks is a zero-sum game. Please let me know how you feel about the new approach used in the links below:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L127\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L152\n. @dealingwith For a little background, sharer.php is actually older than FB.ui and once FB.ui came out, all references to sharer.php disappeared in the docs. People kept using it including, as far as I saw, many major news sites. \nA while back, we at Carrot, as a Facebook Preferred Marketing Developer, were able to ask Facebook whether or not there was an EOL on the sharer.php. We didn't receive an EOL but they did try to discourage us from using it.\nThat said, it appears to be back and that's great! The problem that remains, in the context of this plugin, is that it would alter the expected functionality. Per this plugin, users expect to be able to dynamically set the parameters they want to pass to each social network whereas sharer.php relies solely on Open Graph tags.\nI've added the ability to use the sharer.php functionality as I like that it removes the Facebook JS SDK dependency, but it is disabled by default.\nSee: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/commit/ec3b825bcb2986b19c719af6ac082566f9f628a4#diff-0730bb7c2e8f9ea2438b52e419dd86c9R73\nLet me know what you think!\n. @dealingwith I hope so as well. Here's the new release: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.1.1\n. Interesting, I'll check this out. Thanks!\n. @jenius rebased on master\n. Confirmed: Works in IE9/10\n. Thanks for the bug. Once implemented, albeit a breaking update, this will be fixed with #69.\n. Merged #69. Should fix your issue!\n. Thanks @seanlinsley! Before we merge this in, can you go ahead and compile the CoffeeScript so that the PR also includes the compiled JS versions?\n@jenius I'm not against it but I feel that, with the inclusion of this PR, the library provides users a plethora of options to handle config values. I don't know. I'd love to have more people's opinions on this one. What do you think @seanlinsley?\n. @seanlinsley just check to ensure that each param hasn't already been encoded and you have my :+1:!

Thanks!\n. @tolord @hendrikbeck What version of the button are you using?\n. @hendrikbeck The latest \"released\" version is v0.1.1. Master is a few commits beyond that. Let me know if that solves your problem.\n. @hendrikbeck Interesting, what options are you using when configuring the button?\n. Outside of the share button, have you already inserted the Facebook JS SDK?\n\nCurrently, the only thing that enabled: true/false controls is whether or not the JS SDK is dynamically inserted into the DOM.\nWhen true it runs the following:\n``` coffeescript\nCoffeeScript\ninject_facebook_sdk: ->\n    if !window.FB && @config.networks.facebook.app_id && !@el.body.querySelector('#fb-root')\n      script      = document.createElement(\"script\")\n      script.text = \"window.fbAsyncInit=function(){FB.init({appId:'#{@config.networks.facebook.app_id}',status:true,xfbml:true})};(function(e,t,n){var r,i=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];if(e.getElementById(n)){return}r=e.createElement(t);r.id=n;r.src='#{@config.protocol}connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';i.parentNode.insertBefore(r,i)})(document,'script','facebook-jssdk')\"\n  @el.body.innerHTML += \"<div id='fb-root'></div>\"\n  @el.body.appendChild(script)\n\n```\njavascript\n// JavaScript\n  Share.prototype.inject_facebook_sdk = function() {\n    var script;\n    if (!window.FB && this.config.networks.facebook.app_id && !this.el.body.querySelector('#fb-root')) {\n      script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n      script.text = \"window.fbAsyncInit=function(){FB.init({appId:'\" + this.config.networks.facebook.app_id + \"',status:true,xfbml:true})};(function(e,t,n){var r,i=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];if(e.getElementById(n)){return}r=e.createElement(t);r.id=n;r.src='\" + this.config.protocol + \"connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';i.parentNode.insertBefore(r,i)})(document,'script','facebook-jssdk')\";\n      this.el.body.innerHTML += \"<div id='fb-root'></div>\";\n      return this.el.body.appendChild(script);\n    }\n  };\n. It shouldn't. I'm just trying to narrow down the possibilities. If you could try removing it and seeing if that works, that'd be a huge help.\nSide note for @jenius: We might want to check whether or not #fb-root has content rather than if it simply exists.\n. @jenius You're correct. \nIf the user uses the FB SDK outside of the share button they are required to include the FB JS SDK and #fb-root. Currently, we're checking if #fb-root exists and not if it has content. The problem is that this leaves us open to the possibility that the FB JS SDK wasn't ever initialized. This could be due to developer error, etc. Regardless, it means that the FB portion of the share button won't work.\nBy checking that #fb-root has content, we ensure that (along with window.FB) it was successfully initialized.\n. @hendrikbeck That does help out! Two questions probably I should have asked earlier:\n1) What browser?\n2) When you didn't have <div id=\"fb-root\"></div> added in there manually, was one added automatically via the share button? In addition to that, did it add the Javascript for the async Facebook JS SDK?\n. @inklingsolutions You're going to have to use master at this point. The reason is that we haven't (intentionally) created a release of master with this feature yet. Sorry for the confusion.\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/tree/master/build\n. https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.1.2\n. Thanks a lot!\nCould you include the compiled .js files? Once they're in there, I'll go ahead and merge.\nThanks again!\n. @jenius A new release needs to be pushed. Master is a few updates out of date with releases.\n. @Madebym Sorry for the delay. Are you using an older version? This was fixed in a newer version.\n. I'm torn between putting this in the configs or putting CSS style-able attributes in the docs (including existing ones).\n. Cool, I was leaning that way as well.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. @jenius If you can think of any other ways to clean up/minimize this output... https://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/CSS-Styles\n. If you can rename the config to icon_font... I'll gladly go ahead and merge this.\nThanks a lot!\n. Thanks again!\n. Thank you for the issue, this has been fixed: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/tag/v0.4.1\n. @devonmather As of the other day, we've moved CSS out of the UI config.\nYou should be able to accomplish the same thing with the following:\n``` css\nshareButton label {\nbackground: #ef3b05;\n  color: #ffffff;\n}\n```\nMore info can be found here: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/CSS-Styles\n. The fallback is very similar to the Lato font-set. You have override the injected CSS with your own. \nMore info: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/wiki/CSS-Styles\n. Whoops! Thank you, sir!\n. You're able to disable the entypo from the configuration:\n``` js\nconfig = {\n  ui: {\n    icon_font: false\n  }\n}\nvar share = new Share('.share-button', config);\n```\nDoes this solve your issue?\n. Good looking out! Hopefully that solves the issue. One thing to keep in mind is that this is a later addition to the library. They might need to update for that feature.\n. I'm with @jenius on this one.\n. Thanks! This has been noted and I'm closing it in favor of #160 and a v1.0 release.\n. This may be related to your default mail client. What client opens up when you click the email button?\n. I just re-read your message, what's the URL in the new blank window?\n. What browser (and version) is this occurring in?\n. I don't know what you mean by \"the window with the odd URL is still open\". \nIt sounds like everything is working appropriately. It appears as if you don't have a default email client set on the one computer. We don't really have any control regarding that on our end.\n. Can't do much about that either. Users have the ability to set web email clients (such as GMail) to open in that window on mailto. Seeing as we can't detect what client they use, we can't close the window.\n. Do you happen to have a div with the ID #fb-root in your HTML? If the share button detects that, it doesn't add the SDK as it assumes that it's already been loaded.\n. Any chance you could post your HTML?\n. That's probably going to be your issue. You're going to have a few issues as this isn't a valid HTML document. Please make sure to include (at a minimum) html, head, and body tags. A doctype can't hurt either.\n. Hey @ahmetsali, \nShare Button doesn't support IE8 and, considering all of the backwards compatible code that we'd have to implement, we don't plan to support it in the future.\nYou're obviously more than welcome to fork the repository and have a go at it yourself.\nThanks!\n. \n. Considering the lack of updates, I'm going to assume that this was figured out.\n. Closing this per https://github.com/carrot/share-button/pull/107#issuecomment-51198696\n. querySelector and querySelectorAll return static NodeLists thus when new elements are introduced to the DOM, that match your selector, they won\u2019t be included (unless you re-query the DOM). That's why it is currently duplicated.\n. It's not just adding elements. Changes to existing DOM elements also apply.\n. IE9+ (IE9 is where the classList shim comes into play)\nOther \u2013 more modern \u2013 browsers should be pretty fine across the board. We've gone back a few versions but nothing super crazy.\n. Going to close this out. Please feel free to contribute a PR for a Magento extension.\n. Going to close this out. Please feel free to contribute a PR.\n. On it, thanks @1parkplace!\n. Closing this in favor of #121.\n. Closes #120 \n.

Thanks!\n. I too like the arrow but making it work in all scenarios, short of being quite a bit of ongoing effort, isn't possible given the current state of the design and functionality. For example, in the situation when there's an even number of networks.\nI'm going to close this for now. If there comes a time where it makes sense design-wise, etc to add the arrow back in, we'll certainly do so.\nThanks!\n. Thanks! This has been noted and I'm closing in it favor of #160 and a v1.0 release.\n.

After investigating twitter cards, to use these you must be allow the TwitterBot to access your site, more specifically your link. see https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started#crawling\nBasically the TwitterBot will scan the site for the tags and grab the twitter card info via the meta tags (og or twitter). So long as you're testing this on a site that is live and you are allowing the TwitterBot to scan via your Robots.txt, this will work (with no conflict from share-button)\n. You just need to have the og tags or the twitter meta tags while allowing the twitter bot to crawl your site and you'll be able to use twitter meta cards.\n. does this still persist? \n. Looking thru your code again, you have caption: null - just leave this as a blank string or don't add a value to it and it shouldn't error out.\n. Hey, @TaqiOfficial - we've been looking into this. If you find anymore like the twitter one, let us know! Otherwise in v1.0.0 we're going to have the option to load a platforms JS lib for this and other functionality\n.

Ready for review! cc @kylemac @tmilewski \n. :depressed: \n. :tada: :dancer: :tada: \n. cc @pablaber @tmilewski @kylemac \n. closing this because it's irrelevant now\n. Thoughts before I merge this @tmilewski ?\n. see #173\n. This allows multiple instances of share-button and moves the creation of a button to use the tag <share-button></share-button>\n. Ready to be reviewed before rebase & merge @tmilewski \n. I replicated as best I could locally with your and I'm surprised you didn't get this:\nInvalid App Id: Must be a number or numeric string representing the application id. all.js:64 \nFB.getLoginStatus() called before calling FB.init(). all.js:64\n. When are you requiring this script? If it's before the body loads, this could be the problem. I recommend moving the any js script to the end of the body element\n. wrong branch see #182 \n. the structure of the tests are subject to change\n. Hey @cocovan - Here's the updated jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/a4wq79ev/1/\nI spotted a couple problems, but the share-button is working in your jsfiddle. Within your config object you are listing the networks outside of the networks object, which causes share-button to not apply those. Also your grid that you're using is hiding the share-buttons, because of overflow. In my fiddle I have changed the flyout to top right so you can see them all working.\n. no problem! :)\n. added in #169 \n. Previous size with polyfill:\n\nCurrent size with polyfill:\n\n. Checkout the latest version :) this should be fixed\n. @ragsnas & @HJThompson have you tried authorizing your app then using the SDK again?\n. Hey, due to the inactivity I'm going to close this - let me know if this still persists and reopen the thread :smile:\n. Currently there isn't, but I think this is a good feature - we'll get this in v1.0.x\n. available in current release :)\n. Could you provide more information? If I could see the html document as well as the options you're passing into the ShareButton object that would help a lot with debugging your issue\n. Closing due to inactivity. Please reopen if need be :) \n. confirmed bug, does your fix also work on desktop still and other browsers?\n. see #260 \n. @paramsinghvc is this still an issue or was it resolved? the URL's are encoded properly. Please reopen this if it's still occurring.\n. can we update the readme to include a reference to our script & link tags?\n. Closing this because I've merged docs in with the lastest PR #231 \n. The only thing I have against this is those that use all the networks and/or disable one or two networks. Either way one is going to have a verbose object, I'm personally against this unless a majority of users are disabling a lot of the networks.\n. Fixed in the latest PR #231 \n. moved the link to just point to releases\n. it is as of this past weekend everything is up to date :)\n. Waiting to hear back from Travis-ci, I've restarted the tests for it\n. Awesome, are you able to rebase master onto your branch to bring it back up to speed?\n. cc #260 \n. confirmed via mobile safari/chrome - working fix! \n. see #223\n. Fixed in latest PR #231\n. related to #219 \n. with the latest release \"tagged\", you'll be installing 1.0.2 now :)\n. @jeveloper thanks for bringing this up! I'm going to look into this with the new dev flow :) \n. Thank you @jeveloper - I've figured out how this is going to be handled and hopefully will have it up later today, if not this weekend\n. pending the ability to publish to bower thru authorship, bower will be updated hopefully by EOD.\n. updated and working!\n. fixed :) \n. now it is :D \n. facebook app_id is there if you're going to be using Facebooks SDK along with the sharebutton. Would you be able to clarify your second question?\n. I'm going ahead and closing this issue due to inactivity, feel free to reopen with some clarity! :smile:\n. added here: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/commit/165a2a9ce13e300c1c7dab980faed676ea1ee6f8\n. I've pushed a fix up for this that used less code, could you check to see if this still persists for you?\n. closing this because we're beyond version 0.5\n.

Excuse the strange grammer, it was pretty late when I sent that. Basically stylus is processing the single quotes into double quotes. Locally when I was adjusting styles, encoding the # within the color made it viewable again.  in the compiled source everything is still double quoted.  As the quotes are technically optional we could remove them from our stylus, but this results in errors from stylus. \n. I'm thinking of switching the preprocessor (stylus) of to postcss or just creating a mixin to overwrite 'url()' which would then use JavaScript to remove quotes and encode the string with 'encodeComponentURI()'.\n\n\nHenry Snopek\nOn Tue, Sep 22, 2015 at 9:59 AM, Michael Mahemoff\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nBTW I'm leaving this open though maybe only a patch to stylus would fix it?

I'm assuming you want to do something like this: \n\nhtml\n<share-button>FooBar</share-button>\nThis would display FooBar instead of Share. \n. Also you'll have to rebase master on top of this, then we're set to merge :smile: - sorry for the wait!\n. Oops looks like you might have ran git pull origin master pulled without rebasing (-r flag). You should have the merge commits or anything that's already committed :smile: \n. @mahemoff is on the right track, I'm personally not familiar enough with the Facebook SDK/dashboard to provide more help but definitely start looking there.

The fix for this is ugly, but I'll implement it later today :) \n. fixed in latest release\n. This would be due to Bootstrap, I would first make sure you're using the latest release of share-button (1.0.2). Then once you've done that you'll want to reset the line-height of the parent to share-button to be 1em so that the export icon is vertically centered. To fix the overflow you can do a couple things, depending on the width of the screen and container you could have the networks display: top right or middle right. Otherwise you'll want to set the z-index of share-button to be greater than the parent (container) element\n. Oh wow, yeah a lot of those are outdated. I'm sorry! Thank you for the PR, I'll fix the rest of them as well :)\n. buttonText is where you can update the text of the button, that issue is prior to 1.0.x\n\n\nHenry Snopek\nOn Thu, Oct 15, 2015 at 3:09 AM, Chrysweel notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI want translate the word \"Share\" but I dont know change the text.\nI see in code:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.js#L41\nAlso I see the pull request https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/35\nBut I dont find option button_text... any idea ?\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/240\n.

With react you should still be able to use a custom element. Otherwise regarding accessibility, I believe any custom element is recognized as a div. You can use a class as specified before, just change share-button in the stylus file to .you-custom-class.\n. Oh yeah, totally forgot we did that. You're correct we don't allow just class/div's anymore because a custom tag is less complex. Excuse myself from earlier, didn't have my :coffee: yet. Otherwise @declandewet helped me out with his react knowledge and created an example which uses the latest release.\n. I'm unfortunately unable to debug the provided code without having the client side code as well. I'm not familiar enough with your code to fully debug it. If you provide more code I can dig further into the issue though.\n\nAlright to touch on your points:\n\npass dom node as an element to ShareButton\nuse any html element with some predefined class\n\nNo longer needed because Custom Tags have been available since HTML 4 and act like standard div when styling. With more recent technology, like Web components, you can now render x-tags in javascript. With that in mind, share-button is not a web component because browser support. With that in mind, you're able to create custom elements with react or web components. Because share-button isn't a web component, all you need to do when you display share-button is to instantiate new ShareButton(opts).\n\nuse custom html in share button (in case someone wants to use some other icon or multiple icons for example and or whatever)\n\nIn share-button we create all the icons in our styles file. This full customization of the button without having to touch any html. We no longer use the Entypo font icon set because we can render all of the icons as background images.\n. @MikeQuaci you'll need to require the dist build located here: share-button/dist/share-button.js. This is because the source is written with es2015 and requires polyfills to transpile\n. At the moment yes, see #212 - I've been meaning to get around to a couple issues, this would be one of them. Give me a moment\n. I personally don't like having the compiled files clogging up the git history as well there's been issues in the past when someone will forget to compile and push the latest changes up with their PR. Removing them from the repo allows us to resolve both issues. Regarding the npm scripts, I'd have to add gulp unbuild as well, do you have any reasoning for add them to the npm script? Is it more of a connivence?\nI'm currently merging a couple patches and will be deploy a release which will contain distribution for bower. :smile: \n. pending the ability to publish to bower thru authorship, bower will be updated hopefully by EOD.\n. @MikeQuaci if you want to create a PR for the npm scripts that'd be great :)\nThat's exactly what I did for share-button (jquery shim), I'm just need author access to share-button as the original author isn't available :smile: \n. :+1: I'll merge it in at lunch\n\nHenry Snopek\nOn Mon, Nov 2, 2015 at 11:11 AM, MikeQuaci notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@hhsnopek  PR created https://github.com/carrot/share-button/pull/248\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/246#issuecomment-153087060\n. With the Facebook SDK make sure your permissions are properly set on your facebook app dashboard. Similar issues have come up in the past with the sdk and share-button, also it might be worth adding the title/description as meta tags to that page so share-button grabs from their and all web crawlers can access the same information you're passing into the config object.\n. Hey @littlee could you provide which version of IE as well as the json object you're passing into the ShareButton instance?\n. This is very uneasy considering that before I pushed to make the switch to using custom tags I tested <share-button></share-button on IE and everything rendered and worked properly, minus a few IE quirks in our stylesheet. I do need to look into this more, if anyone finds more references or helpful documents please add them to the thread\n. If I recall the discussion correctly, the plan was support IE10 and higher\n. This is great guys! @almoral which versions of IE does that work on?\n. Hey guys any luck here, @vincent-guesnard? \n\nI'm making note of adding the polyfill (provided above by @almoral) for IE9 support, but it maybe in a separate release than the mainstream release :smile: \n. Going to get this figured out before the next release tomorrow morning - most likely wont have the IE9 polyfill, but I'll add a way to build it to the gulp tasks.

I apologize for that. The issue has been addressed and a fix will be released soon!\n. Her @Chrysweel, if meta tags are giving you a headache you can define the text, url and description in the config object (which is passed in on creation of the button).\nOtherwise share-button looks for meta name=\"og:title\" first, if it's not found it'll look for meta name=\"twitter:title\", if that also is not found then it'll use meta name=\"title\"\n\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.js#L678\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions :smile: \n. it seems that the issue has been resolved - let me know if you're still having issues @vbledar \n\njindw commented on Jan 13\nsorry :(\nit 's my fault.\nfixed in 0.1.21\n.

Hey @d-knafo - Unfortunately as of now share-button does not support a change in direction, I'd recommend setting the share-button element to use direction: ltr !important for now.

Hey @connorjburton would you be able to rebase master onto this?\n. uh oh, looks like your tree got separated from our master - the last commit, Merge branch 'npm-...' shouldn't exist because it hasn't been merged into our share-button master. did you perform git pull upstream master -r? upstream should be pointing at carrot/share-button\n.

Ohhh, sorry about that - completely missed what you were saying! But that would be correct it doesn't work as it should because it's coming from github\nsee http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9841026/reference-github-file-in-jsfiddle\n\nyou'll need to reference the raw files here: https://github.com/carrot/share-button-bower/releases. This still might not work considering Github is not a CDN, we previously had these served on a CDN. I'm uploading the previous versions of share-button tonight if you need those a well!\nI'll go ahead and create an issue to add share-button to cdnjs\n. Ahh well as of now with the latest version you'll use new ShareButton(config); instead of new Share() - are you able to get it working now?\n. Ahh okay, I see where you're trying to go with it now - what you can do is pass the element:\nvar element = document.getElementsByClassName('share-button')[0];\nvar sharebtn = new ShareButton(element, conf);`\n. Sorry I was mistaken, just pass: \"div.btn.share-button\"\ninstead of  var element = document.getElementsByClassName('share-button')[0];\nI just realized my mistake, sorry about that - you'll be able to grab your element using selectors - mdn reference\n. @gauravmak I hate to apologize once more, but since share-button v1.0.0 we no long use any divs. The reason behind this is to be modular and use a custom element which is supported all the way back into html 4.1 (if I'm recalling correctly). https://jsfiddle.net/r80akxrr here's a jsfiddle with working resources to sharebutton's lib\n. oh wow, I'm sorry about that!

Awesome - thank you again @wil93 \nI'll be dropping a release tomorrow morning :smile: \n. note:\nfixes #285 \n. hey @joelmats it seems that this change breaks the tests, could you look into why?\n. I'd like to get this in the next release tomorrow morning :smile: - lemme know if you need any help adding the second test!\n. Just making sure i'm on the right track with this, now (only if you're using the sdk), facebook sharing will load on the current page. If you're not using the sdk it will create a pop out? \n. Would you you be able to get the functionality of it to pop out even when the sdk is in use to match the other networks?\n. oh alright that's perfect then - if you could just separate out the sdk test from the original facebook test that would be great (then we'll have two different configs), still want to test against both :smile: \n. Beautiful - once travis is complete if you could squash the commits into one nice commit, we'll go ahead and merge this bad boy in :smiley: \n. thanks again! :smile: \n. yeah, all is well tho :)\n. awesome! - if you're able to make those two small changes I'll merge this in :smile: \n. thank you :grinning: \n. Hey @AbrahamCovelo yesterday I merged a fix in for the email button #208 - A new release will be out soon\n. hey @connorjburton it seems that your dev environment isn't fully setup, I've found this to help guide you :smile: \nclosing as the error is unrelated to share-button, but let me know if you need more help!\n. haha I believe you! I've had a lot of issues in the past with setting up dev environments, asking is a great way to find what you need :smile: \n. @connorjburton this might be the issue, you've given root permissions to npm, what you'll want to do is follow this: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions\nI also recommend going ahead afterwards and reinstalling npm with these commands:\nnpm cache clean -f\nnpm install -g n\nn stable\nnpm install npm -g\nafter all that remove the node_modules folder in the project and run npm i to install all of your project dependencies, you might want to add share-button to your package.json prior to running npm i\n. :+1: glad you solved the problem!\n. hey @neuropass - from a quick glance you'd have to render the contents of the window into the modal, most likely using an iframe. I've never used bootstrap's modals, but my assumption is that you'll either have to create a custom modal that communicates with the social networks apis or you'll have to override the render function and trigger the modal to load an iframe with the share link.\n. Just to chime in; in share-button's current state we've added the ability for users to integrate the button in various ways and allow a lot more customization than previous versions. Regarding how lightweight share-button is, well that's left to one's opinion. I do agree that it's current state isn't the lightest, but some people will consider jquery to be light and that's pretty big. Tho in the end we have trade-offs, the reason we jumped in size so much between  v0.5.0 & v1.0.3 is due to the switch from coffeescript & babel, this is due to everything that goes into transpiling. If you wanted the lighter version, I'd recommend going with v0.5.0, but be aware that it comes with the downside of less customization. In the future I'd like to have the ability to have a couple options for building share-button, like no polyfills or removal of collision-detection, these were features that the community requested, but not everybody uses them. In the end if you want to cut down on everything, you have the ability to customize the button and completely remove lato, you just need to clone it down and compile your changes :smile: \nHere's the size comparisons between v1.0.3 & v0.5.0\n| v1.0.3 | size |\n| --- | --- |\n| share-button.css | 31.2 KB |\n| share-button.js | 65 KB |\n| share-button.min.css | 30.1 KB |\n| share-button.min.js | 29.2 KB |\n| v0.5.0 | size |\n| --- | --- |\n| share.js | 20.6 KB |\n| share.min.js | 15.2 KB |\n.

Hey @nomoregrapes \nI apologize for the lack of communication that the community and yourself has received. I regretfully must inform you and the community that this project is no longer being maintained. Shortly after this post is public you will see that the description has been updated with a note stating that this project is now unmaintained. Someday I'd like to imagine this project would become relevant to us and comeback to life. Once again I apologize for the lack of maintenance, communication and love towards this project and the community.\nUntil the revival of this project - live long and prosper.\n. Without the typography mixin it's stuff messed up, looking deeper tho\n. I was thinking if the Share-button CSS was added last, it would easily override all the presets given. Unless the typography() mixin uses !important\n. Found it... Axis did not affect share-button at all.\n. it is now possible! just exclude the stylesheet!\n. This feature is available now!\n. see explanation of closure in #109 \n. Considering that it's possible to use a custome stylesheet, I'm going to close this.

After investigating twitter cards, to use these you must be allow the TwitterBot to access your site, more specifically your link. see https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started#crawling\nBasically the TwitterBot will scan the site for the tags and grab the twitter card info via the meta tags (og or twitter). So long as you're testing this on a site that is live and you are allowing the TwitterBot to scan via your Robots.txt, this will work (with no conflict from share-button)\n. You just need to have the og tags or the twitter meta tags while allowing the twitter bot to crawl your site and you'll be able to use twitter meta cards.\n. does this still persist? \n. Looking thru your code again, you have caption: null - just leave this as a blank string or don't add a value to it and it shouldn't error out.\n. Hey, @TaqiOfficial - we've been looking into this. If you find anymore like the twitter one, let us know! Otherwise in v1.0.0 we're going to have the option to load a platforms JS lib for this and other functionality\n. Rebasing into one commit - functionality of the share-button is working. Time to get the styles working!\n. cc @kylemac @tmilewski \n. locally we've fixed the styles as well\n. yeah - I'm going to push the rebased version up with the other changes \n. before this gets merged, I'm going to add documentation \n. :+1: thank you\n.

Ready to be reviewed before rebase & merge @tmilewski \n. I replicated as best I could locally with your and I'm surprised you didn't get this:\nInvalid App Id: Must be a number or numeric string representing the application id. all.js:64 \nFB.getLoginStatus() called before calling FB.init(). all.js:64\n. When are you requiring this script? If it's before the body loads, this could be the problem. I recommend moving the any js script to the end of the body element\n. wrong branch see #182 \n. the structure of the tests are subject to change\n. Hey @cocovan - Here's the updated jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/a4wq79ev/1/\nI spotted a couple problems, but the share-button is working in your jsfiddle. Within your config object you are listing the networks outside of the networks object, which causes share-button to not apply those. Also your grid that you're using is hiding the share-buttons, because of overflow. In my fiddle I have changed the flyout to top right so you can see them all working.\n. no problem! :)\n. added in #169 \n. Previous size with polyfill:\n\nCurrent size with polyfill:\n\n. Checkout the latest version :) this should be fixed\n. @ragsnas & @HJThompson have you tried authorizing your app then using the SDK again?\n. Hey, due to the inactivity I'm going to close this - let me know if this still persists and reopen the thread :smile:\n. Currently there isn't, but I think this is a good feature - we'll get this in v1.0.x\n. available in current release :)\n. Could you provide more information? If I could see the html document as well as the options you're passing into the ShareButton object that would help a lot with debugging your issue\n. Closing due to inactivity.

The only thing I have against this is those that use all the networks and/or disable one or two networks.

Excuse the strange grammer, it was pretty late when I sent that. Basically stylus is processing the single quotes into double quotes. Locally when I was adjusting styles, encoding the # within the color made it viewable again.  in the compiled source everything is still double quoted.  As the quotes are technically optional we could remove them from our stylus, but this results in errors from stylus. \n. I'm thinking of switching the preprocessor (stylus) of to postcss or just creating a mixin to overwrite 'url()' which would then use JavaScript to remove quotes and encode the string with 'encodeComponentURI()'.\n\n\nHenry Snopek\nOn Tue, Sep 22, 2015 at 9:59 AM, Michael Mahemoff\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nBTW I'm leaving this open though maybe only a patch to stylus would fix it?

The fix for this is ugly, but I'll implement it later today :) \n. fixed in latest release\n. This would be due to Bootstrap, I would first make sure you're using the latest release of share-button (1.0.2). Then once you've done that you'll want to reset the line-height of the parent to share-button to be 1em so that the export icon is vertically centered. To fix the overflow you can do a couple things, depending on the width of the screen and container you could have the networks display: top right or middle right. Otherwise you'll want to set the z-index of share-button to be greater than the parent (container) element\n. Oh wow, yeah a lot of those are outdated. I'm sorry! Thank you for the PR, I'll fix the rest of them as well :)\n. buttonText is where you can update the text of the button, that issue is prior to 1.0.x\n\n\nHenry Snopek\nOn Thu, Oct 15, 2015 at 3:09 AM, Chrysweel notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI want translate the word \"Share\" but I dont know change the text.\nI see in code:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.js#L41\nAlso I see the pull request https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/35\nBut I dont find option button_text... any idea ?\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/240\n.

With react you should still be able to use a custom element. Otherwise regarding accessibility, I believe any custom element is recognized as a div. You can use a class as specified before, just change share-button in the stylus file to .you-custom-class.\n. Oh yeah, totally forgot we did that. You're correct we don't allow just class/div's anymore because a custom tag is less complex. Excuse myself from earlier, didn't have my :coffee: yet. Otherwise @declandewet helped me out with his react knowledge and created an example which uses the latest release.\n. I'm unfortunately unable to debug the provided code without having the client side code as well. I'm not familiar enough with your code to fully debug it. If you provide more code I can dig further into the issue though.\n\nAlright to touch on your points:\n\npass dom node as an element to ShareButton\nuse any html element with some predefined class\n\nNo longer needed because Custom Tags have been available since HTML 4 and act like standard div when styling. With more recent technology, like Web components, you can now render x-tags in javascript. With that in mind, share-button is not a web component because browser support. With that in mind, you're able to create custom elements with react or web components. Because share-button isn't a web component, all you need to do when you display share-button is to instantiate new ShareButton(opts).\n\nuse custom html in share button (in case someone wants to use some other icon or multiple icons for example and or whatever)\n\nIn share-button we create all the icons in our styles file. This full customization of the button without having to touch any html. We no longer use the Entypo font icon set because we can render all of the icons as background images.\n. @MikeQuaci you'll need to require the dist build located here: share-button/dist/share-button.js. This is because the source is written with es2015 and requires polyfills to transpile\n. At the moment yes, see #212 - I've been meaning to get around to a couple issues, this would be one of them. Give me a moment\n. I personally don't like having the compiled files clogging up the git history as well there's been issues in the past when someone will forget to compile and push the latest changes up with their PR. Removing them from the repo allows us to resolve both issues. Regarding the npm scripts, I'd have to add gulp unbuild as well, do you have any reasoning for add them to the npm script? Is it more of a connivence?\nI'm currently merging a couple patches and will be deploy a release which will contain distribution for bower. :smile: \n. pending the ability to publish to bower thru authorship, bower will be updated hopefully by EOD.\n. @MikeQuaci if you want to create a PR for the npm scripts that'd be great :)\nThat's exactly what I did for share-button (jquery shim), I'm just need author access to share-button as the original author isn't available :smile: \n. :+1: I'll merge it in at lunch\n\nHenry Snopek\nOn Mon, Nov 2, 2015 at 11:11 AM, MikeQuaci notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@hhsnopek  PR created https://github.com/carrot/share-button/pull/248\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/246#issuecomment-153087060\n. With the Facebook SDK make sure your permissions are properly set on your facebook app dashboard. Similar issues have come up in the past with the sdk and share-button, also it might be worth adding the title/description as meta tags to that page so share-button grabs from their and all web crawlers can access the same information you're passing into the config object.\n. Hey @littlee could you provide which version of IE as well as the json object you're passing into the ShareButton instance?\n. This is very uneasy considering that before I pushed to make the switch to using custom tags I tested <share-button></share-button on IE and everything rendered and worked properly, minus a few IE quirks in our stylesheet. I do need to look into this more, if anyone finds more references or helpful documents please add them to the thread\n. If I recall the discussion correctly, the plan was support IE10 and higher\n. This is great guys! @almoral which versions of IE does that work on?\n. Hey guys any luck here, @vincent-guesnard? \n\nI'm making note of adding the polyfill (provided above by @almoral) for IE9 support, but it maybe in a separate release than the mainstream release :smile: \n.

I'm personally unsure why it happens, but my assumption is that Safari 5.1.17 does not support the base64 encoded svgs or possibly data:image/svg+xml within the background url property\n. Hey @vincent-guesnard, did you add this to #250? \n. hey @whazap - would you be able to rebase master onto this? I'd like to merge this in before I cut a release tomorrow morning :smile: \n. Hey @wil93 you're correct when you say toRFC3986 is not a standard method in the String class, though it's easier to add to the String class, as it's the better class to be added to. Sorry for the inconvenience it brought you!\n. you have a good point :smile: - we'll take it into consideration, if you'd like to make a PR with a proper change (as you purposed) - we'll gladly look it over!\n. Hey @paramsinghvc currently we have an open issue regarding email sharing here: #260 \nI'll be updating/addressing the issue soon\n. Hey @TiagoDeSousa I believe you're looking for the distributed code instead of the source, this can be located here: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases - ignore the source code zips, those are not the files you are looking for :grinning: \n. Thank you everyone for the help!\nHere's another solution, you can download the bundled release and add the correct path to examples/animation.html :smile: \n. Hey @amalalili here's the answers to your questions :smile: \n1.) remove the icon with custom css\n\nremove this line - https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.styl#L74\n\n2.) You're able to disable the social accounts by changing enabled to false in your config object.\n\nEach network has an \"enable\" key which you can set to false, to disable the network - https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.js#L53\n\n3.) @Chrysweel is right, there's an open issue and it's well beyond it's due date to be taken care of. I apologize for that. The issue has been addressed and a fix will be released soon!\n. Her @Chrysweel, if meta tags are giving you a headache you can define the text, url and description in the config object (which is passed in on creation of the button).\nOtherwise share-button looks for meta name=\"og:title\" first, if it's not found it'll look for meta name=\"twitter:title\", if that also is not found then it'll use meta name=\"title\"\n\nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.js#L678\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions :smile: \n. it seems that the issue has been resolved - let me know if you're still having issues @vbledar \n\njindw commented on Jan 13\nsorry :(\nit 's my fault.\nfixed in 0.1.21\n. Awesome! tho the purpose of the stacking is so that it will display all on the mobile screen... what's the fix look like?\n. Hey @d-knafo - Unfortunately as of now share-button does not support a change in direction, I'd recommend setting the share-button element to use direction: ltr !important for now. If you're looking to reorder the icons you can use config.ui.networkOrder and pass a String Array with the order you'd like (from rtl ) \nhttps://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.js#L43\n. Hey @brylie the share-button was really meant, by default, to be used with spacing around/below a block of text. Your solution is perfect :smile: \n. :+1: Thank you :smile: \n. Hey @holm would you able to add README.md & LICENSE to the list as well?\n. Oh and docs :smile: \n. Hey @connorjburton would you be able to rebase master onto this?\n. uh oh, looks like your tree got separated from our master - the last commit, Merge branch 'npm-...' shouldn't exist because it hasn't been merged into our share-button master. did you perform git pull upstream master -r? upstream should be pointing at carrot/share-button\n. Hey @gauravmak oddly I'm unable to get it to work inside jsfiddle or codepen - though I went ahead and pulled down v1.0.3 and locally got examples/animation.html to work\n. are you downloading the files directly from the latest release?\n. let me give it another go, one sec\n. I went ahead and downloaded it locally again and created a fresh html file and loaded everything in. Everything is working as it should, which browser & os are you using?\n. Ohhh, sorry about that - completely missed what you were saying! But that would be correct it doesn't work as it should because it's coming from github\nsee http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9841026/reference-github-file-in-jsfiddle\n\nyou'll need to reference the raw files here: https://github.com/carrot/share-button-bower/releases. This still might not work considering Github is not a CDN, we previously had these served on a CDN. I'm uploading the previous versions of share-button tonight if you need those a well!\nI'll go ahead and create an issue to add share-button to cdnjs\n. Ahh well as of now with the latest version you'll use new ShareButton(config); instead of new Share() - are you able to get it working now?\n. Ahh okay, I see where you're trying to go with it now - what you can do is pass the element:\nvar element = document.getElementsByClassName('share-button')[0];\nvar sharebtn = new ShareButton(element, conf);`\n. Sorry I was mistaken, just pass: \"div.btn.share-button\"\ninstead of  var element = document.getElementsByClassName('share-button')[0];\nI just realized my mistake, sorry about that - you'll be able to grab your element using selectors - mdn reference\n. @gauravmak I hate to apologize once more, but since share-button v1.0.0 we no long use any divs. The reason behind this is to be modular and use a custom element which is supported all the way back into html 4.1 (if I'm recalling correctly). https://jsfiddle.net/r80akxrr here's a jsfiddle with working resources to sharebutton's lib\n. oh wow, I'm sorry about that! Thank you for bringing that up! - would you be able to update the docs and create a PR? \n. fixed in #288\n. :smile:\n. Hey @joelmats - is this the same issue as #266?\n. Hey @wil93 would be so kind to remove the functions and create a StringUtils with those as methods? This way we'd leave a smaller footprint and not invade the global namespace with the functions :grinning: \n. You rock @wil93 :smile: - tho could you change the commit message? haha they're no longer functions - I'll merge in the morning :sunrise: \n. Awesome - thank you again @wil93 \nI'll be dropping a release tomorrow morning :smile: \n. note:\nfixes #285 \n. hey @joelmats it seems that this change breaks the tests, could you look into why?\n. I'd like to get this in the next release tomorrow morning :smile: - lemme know if you need any help adding the second test!\n. Just making sure i'm on the right track with this, now (only if you're using the sdk), facebook sharing will load on the current page. If you're not using the sdk it will create a pop out? \n. Would you you be able to get the functionality of it to pop out even when the sdk is in use to match the other networks?\n. oh alright that's perfect then - if you could just separate out the sdk test from the original facebook test that would be great (then we'll have two different configs), still want to test against both :smile: \n. Beautiful - once travis is complete if you could squash the commits into one nice commit, we'll go ahead and merge this bad boy in :smiley: \n. thanks again! :smile: \n. yeah, all is well tho :)\n. awesome! - if you're able to make those two small changes I'll merge this in :smile: \n. thank you :grinning: \n. Hey @AbrahamCovelo yesterday I merged a fix in for the email button #208 - A new release will be out soon\n. hey @connorjburton it seems that your dev environment isn't fully setup, I've found this to help guide you :smile: \nclosing as the error is unrelated to share-button, but let me know if you need more help!\n. haha I believe you! I've had a lot of issues in the past with setting up dev environments, asking is a great way to find what you need :smile: \n. @connorjburton this might be the issue, you've given root permissions to npm, what you'll want to do is follow this: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions\nI also recommend going ahead afterwards and reinstalling npm with these commands:\nnpm cache clean -f\nnpm install -g n\nn stable\nnpm install npm -g\nafter all that remove the node_modules folder in the project and run npm i to install all of your project dependencies, you might want to add share-button to your package.json prior to running npm i\n. :+1: glad you solved the problem!\n. hey @neuropass - from a quick glance you'd have to render the contents of the window into the modal, most likely using an iframe. I've never used bootstrap's modals, but my assumption is that you'll either have to create a custom modal that communicates with the social networks apis or you'll have to override the render function and trigger the modal to load an iframe with the share link.\n. Just to chime in; in share-button's current state we've added the ability for users to integrate the button in various ways and allow a lot more customization than previous versions. Regarding how lightweight share-button is, well that's left to one's opinion. I do agree that it's current state isn't the lightest, but some people will consider jquery to be light and that's pretty big. Tho in the end we have trade-offs, the reason we jumped in size so much between  v0.5.0 & v1.0.3 is due to the switch from coffeescript & babel, this is due to everything that goes into transpiling. If you wanted the lighter version, I'd recommend going with v0.5.0, but be aware that it comes with the downside of less customization. In the future I'd like to have the ability to have a couple options for building share-button, like no polyfills or removal of collision-detection, these were features that the community requested, but not everybody uses them. In the end if you want to cut down on everything, you have the ability to customize the button and completely remove lato, you just need to clone it down and compile your changes :smile: \nHere's the size comparisons between v1.0.3 & v0.5.0\n| v1.0.3 | size |\n| --- | --- |\n| share-button.css | 31.2 KB |\n| share-button.js | 65 KB |\n| share-button.min.css | 30.1 KB |\n| share-button.min.js | 29.2 KB |\n| v0.5.0 | size |\n| --- | --- |\n| share.js | 20.6 KB |\n| share.min.js | 15.2 KB |\n. It appears we're missing utf8 in our data uri\nsee this thread - https://mobile.twitter.com/hhsnopek/status/728251445103845376\n. Hey @nomoregrapes \nI apologize for the lack of communication that the community and yourself has received. I regretfully must inform you and the community that this project is no longer being maintained. Shortly after this post is public you will see that the description has been updated with a note stating that this project is now unmaintained. Someday I'd like to imagine this project would become relevant to us and comeback to life. Once again I apologize for the lack of maintenance, communication and love towards this project and the community.\nUntil the revival of this project - live long and prosper.\n. ",

No, that's just the entirely crazy encode() function that was \"checking\" for a string being \"already encoded\" with a quite unlikely heuristic that was passed by our email text. Don't know why. We just eliminated the check:\nShareUtils.prototype.encode = function(str) {\n    if (typeof str === \"undefined\") {\n      return str;\n    } else {\n      return str.to_rfc3986();\n    }\n  };\nEverything works fine now.\n. The point is not about newlines\u2014the point is that \"testing for being encoded\" in is_encoded() is entirely crazy. You must know which of your data is encoded or not. Encoding and decoding and testing for differences should give you always false, or your coding functions are broken.\n. > On 29 Jul 2015, at 20:17, Jeffrey Balinsky notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@vigna From what you posted I am not entirely sure how to get newlines to work in the email\n\nI think the basic point was to remove the \"is_encoded\" from\nShareUtils.prototype.encode = function(str) {\n                    if (typeof str === \"undefined\") {\n                            return str;\n                    } else {\n                            return str.to_rfc3986();\n                    }\n            };\nbut the problem is that now the source is in coffee, so I have no way to do an easy diff.\nBut you can download everything we use from http://wikirank.di.unimi.it/\nCiao,\nseba\n.

I've downloaded the SVG files and change the background images to point directly to the files instead of the URI data and it worked. Apparently the encoding generated after stylus compilation is not longer compatible with Chrome.\n. At the end i tried something different because i couldn't change de color\n(i don't have much experience working with svg). Because I was using\nfontawesome on the project for other stuff, I decided to use those icons\ninstead and worked like a charm.\nOn May 5, 2016 10:36 PM, \"Gaurav Makhecha\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@rcamposp https://github.com/rcamposp How did you exactly save SVGs as\nimage files?
