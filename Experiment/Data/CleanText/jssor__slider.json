I will release v16 after that.\n. it's ready now.\nplease just download latest version.\nhttps://github.com/jssor/jquery-slider/archive/master.zip\n. Jssor Slider works with certain number of slides. You can't add/remove slide dynamically.\nBut you can alter content of any slide dynamically.\n<div u=\"slides\" ...>\n    <div id=\"slide0\"><!-- any content here --></div>\n    <div id=\"slide1\"><!-- any content here --></div>\n    <div id=\"slide2\"><!-- any content here --></div>\n</div>\n. Jssor Slider will load images with  format on demand.\nThat's to say an image with lazy loading format will not be loaded until it comes into view.\nActually, $LazyLoading also controls the pre-loading of images in adjacent slides.\nIf the value of $LazyLoading is 0, it will load images in current slide only.\nIf the value of $LazyLoading is 1, it will load images in current slide and 1 prev slide and 1 next slide.\nIf the value of $LazyLoading is 2, it will load images in current slide and 2 prev slides and 2 next slides.\nAnd so on...\nJssor Slider will not delay loading of image which is not with lazy loading format.\nSo, to achieve your goal, you can set $LazyLoading to 0.\n. Yes, exactly!\n. By default, slide inherit size from 'slides container', the size of slide is the same as 'slides container'.\nAlso, you can set slide size manually by specify '$SlideWidth' and '$SlideHeight' options.\nIn this situation, slide size is different from 'slides container', and you have chance to display more than one slide in the 'slides container'.\nOpen 'demos-jquery\\carousel-slider.source.html' you can see $DisplayPieces value is 4, $SlideWidth is 200, and width of 'slides container' is 809, and $SlideSpacing is 3.\n. @purepure You can dynamically fill html code and then initialize jssor slider.\n. For now, you need to initialize it every time. I will improve this feature to allow adding/removing slide later.\nNote that when jssor slider initialize, it will reformat the hierarchy of raw html elements in the slider1_container. It is not reusable then, you need to remove and then repopulate the whole slider1_container to initialize the second slider.\n. Not only repopulate the slide list, you'd repopulate the whole slider element.\n. What's the browser and os version?\n. I have just updated chrome to 35.0.1916.153 m.\nNo such problem at my side.\nBtw, what's your screen size? And what size of chrome when this happen?\n. My screen is maximum 1280x768\nPlease go through following steps to have a test.\nopen the web page in chrome, right click on the slider, click 'inspect element' menu item in the context menu, and then find the following 3 elements, and then dynamically change 'overflow' of all the 3 elements to 'visible'. close the inspector and check if the problem is still there.\nhtml\n<div id=\"slider1_container\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 1263px; height: 566.4069230769231px; overflow: hidden;\">\n    <!-- Loading Screen -->\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 1300px; height: 583px; -webkit-transform-origin: 0px 0px; -webkit-transform: scale(0.9715384615384616);\">\n        <div style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 1300px; height: 583px; overflow: visible;\">\n. Thanks!\nI got the problem. It is known as 'chrome scale and overflow problem'.\nreference http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16687023/bug-with-transform-scale-and-overflow-hidden-in-chrome\nI am going to fix it.\n. There are 2 ways to fix this,\na. disable hardware acceleration for child sliders\njavascript\n    var nestedSliderOptions = {\n            $HWA: false,\n            ...\n        }\n    };\nb. add '-webkit-transform: perspective(2000px)' to arrows,\nhtml\n    <span class=\"jssora05l\" style=\"left: 0px; top: 252px; width: 38px; height: 78px; z-index: 1; -webkit-transform: perspective(2000px);\" u=\"arrowleft\"></span>\n    <span class=\"jssora05r\" style=\"top: 252px; width: 38px; height: 78px; right: 0px; z-index: 1; -webkit-transform: perspective(2000px);\" u=\"arrowright\"></span>\n. I checked it.\nThe arrow navigator is for child slider.\nIf you scale child slider, it would work. But the slider you are scaling is parent slider.\n. Please open the system with IE and save the whole page by 'File->Save as...' command and choose 'Webpage, complete (.htm,.html)'.\n. For now, I guess it's css level issue. You can dump all css used in your client's system, and place them in the page of your test environment. And I am happy to debug the issue for you if in need.\n. Good to know that the problem has been located. I got similar problem before, some scripts try to remove or modify elements.\n. @sealemar \nYes\n. Please replace 'jssor_slider.$On' with 'jssor_slider1.$On' then.\n. ```\n        function UpdateArrows(currentIndex, previousIndex) {\n        //the '9' is display pieces of thumbnail navigator\n        if (currentIndex == jssor_slider1.$SlidesCount() - 9) {\n            // hit the last slide, hide the right arrow\n            $('.o-slideshow .next').hide();\n        } else {\n            // not the last slide, show the right arrow\n            $('.o-slideshow .next').show();\n        }\n        if (currentIndex == 0) {\n            // hit the first slide, hide the left arrow\n            $('.o-slideshow .prev').hide();\n        } else {\n            // not the first slide, show the left arrow\n            $('.o-slideshow .prev').show();\n        }\n    }\n\n    jssor_slider1.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, UpdateArrows);\n    UpdateArrows(0, -1);\n\n```\nSee http://jsfiddle.net/Q8wNv/5/\n. This is reasonable feature. But it hasn't been implemented yet.\nI will plan for this feature for long run. And now please just go ahead with your own solution.\nThanks for this question!\n. Is it better to ignore demos, examples and skins from installing with bower?\n. registered,\nbower info jssor-slider\nIt returns 'no version available'\nshould I create a release?\n. See reference\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/23350831/jssor-full-height-or-full-screen-slider-possible/23352018#23352018\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24472909/how-can-i-make-jssor-change-its-aspect-ratio\n. Yes, you are right.\nWe need a new method $ResizeCanvas. But it's not ready yet.\n. Right, but it's not ready yet.\n. For the latest version 25.2.0, we added a new method $ScaleSize(width, height) instead of $ResizeCanvas.. This option can be set manually only.\n. Separated stylesheet is now supported, the following code is the implementation with logic borrowed from $(elem).css(property). I think the performance is better than jQuery, please check it out.\n``` javascript\n    function Css(elmt, name, value) {\n        /// \n        ///     access css\n        ///     $JssorUtils$.$Css(elmt, name);         //get css value\n        ///     $JssorUtils$.$Css(elmt, name, value);  //set css value\n        /// \n        /// \n        ///     the element to access css\n        /// \n        /// \n        ///     the name of css property\n        /// \n        /// \n        ///     the value to set\n        /// \n        if (value != undefined) {\n            elmt.style[name] = value;\n        }\n        else {\n            var style = elmt.currentStyle || elmt.style;\n            value = style[name];\n        if(value == \"\" && window.getComputedStyle) {\n            style = elmt.ownerDocument.defaultView.getComputedStyle(elmt, null);\n\n            style && (value = style.getPropertyValue(name) || style[name]);\n        }\n\n        return value;\n    }\n}\n\n``\n. Please use class to specify css forslider1_container.\nThere is no problem offunction Css(elmt, name, value)` for computed style handling.\nFor the issue stated above, it caused by reformatting of html code.\nTo make the raw html to work as a slider, it will reformatted while Jssor Slider initializes.\n. Yes, it's definitely free!\n. jssor@live.com\n. Yes, you can make custom theme\n. To make arrow skin, you can start with 'skin\\arrow-01.source.html'\nGiven the following skin code,\n<!-- Arrow Navigator Skin Begin -->\n    <style>\n        /* jssor slider arrow navigator skin 01 css */\n        /*\n        .jssora01l              (normal)\n        .jssora01r              (normal)\n        .jssora01l:hover        (normal mouseover)\n        .jssora01r:hover        (normal mouseover)\n        .jssora01ldn            (mousedown)\n        .jssora01rdn            (mousedown)\n        */\n        .jssora01l, .jssora01r, .jssora01ldn, .jssora01rdn\n        {\n            position: absolute;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            display: block;\n            background: url(../img/a01.png) no-repeat;\n            overflow:hidden;\n        }\n        .jssora01l { background-position: -8px -38px; }\n        .jssora01r { background-position: -68px -38px; }\n        .jssora01l:hover { background-position: -128px -38px; }\n        .jssora01r:hover { background-position: -188px -38px; }\n        .jssora01ldn { background-position: -8px -38px; }\n        .jssora01rdn { background-position: -68px -38px; }\n    </style>\n    <!-- Arrow Left -->\n    <span u=\"arrowleft\" class=\"jssora01l\" style=\"width: 45px; height: 45px; top: 123px; left: 8px;\">\n    </span>\n    <!-- Arrow Right -->\n    <span u=\"arrowright\" class=\"jssora01r\" style=\"width: 45px; height: 45px; top: 123px; right: 8px\">\n    </span>\n    <!-- Arrow Navigator Skin End -->\nYou can change the skin name 'jssora01' to 'yourarrowskinname'.\nAnd then you can make any change to make the arrow to be what you like.\nPlease let me know if you have any question.\n. Hi,\nThanks for the good question!\nFor long run, I have to implement this feature. But I can't get it done shortly.\n. Thanks for your interest. But there is a long way to go, it can't be done at the moment.\n. Content in slide should always scale along with slider. Please use css tricks to meet your needs.\nReference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25532209/jssor-slider-responsive-caption-unwanted-text-resize\n. There is a $ChanceToShow option for arrow navigator and bullet navigator.\nYou can set $ChanceToShow option to 0 when you detect there is only one slide.\n. I guess you mean partial zoom effect.\nBut there is no such feature.\n. Your settings for slider container, $SlideWidth, $SlideHeight are all correct.\nAnd $FillMode: 0 would be OK.\nIn this manner, it will  stretch image to 800x400. But I am not sure it will come with retina look or not.\n. As ie 7 or earlier doesn't recognize multi class names. The main purpose is to be compatible with old browsers. For the experience by specifying single class for button like element,  we benefit on good performance with all browsers.\nThe methodology in jssor to implement a button like element is,\nGiven an element with class name 'yourclassname', it will add 'dn' suffix on mousedown, 'av' on active and 'ds' on disabled.\nOpen 'skin\\arrow-01.source.html', you will see typical css for arrow navigator,\ncss\n        <style>\n            /* jssor slider arrow navigator skin 01 css */\n            /*\n            .jssora01l              (normal)\n            .jssora01r              (normal)\n            .jssora01l:hover        (normal mouseover)\n            .jssora01r:hover        (normal mouseover)\n            .jssora01ldn            (mousedown)\n            .jssora01rdn            (mousedown)\n            */\n            .jssora01l, .jssora01r, .jssora01ldn, .jssora01rdn\n            {\n                position: absolute;\n                cursor: pointer;\n                display: block;\n                background: url(../img/a01.png) no-repeat;\n                overflow:hidden;\n            }\n            .jssora01l { background-position: -8px -38px; }\n            .jssora01r { background-position: -68px -38px; }\n            .jssora01l:hover { background-position: -128px -38px; }\n            .jssora01r:hover { background-position: -188px -38px; }\n            .jssora01ldn { background-position: -8px -38px; }\n            .jssora01rdn { background-position: -68px -38px; }\n        </style>\n. Here is workaround,\n``` javascript\n            function DisplayHideArrow(index) {\n                if (index == 0) {\n                    //hit the first slide, display arrow right and hide arrow left\n                }\n                else if (index == jssor_slider1.$SlidesCount() - 1) {\n                    //hit the last slide, display arrow left and hide arrow right\n                }\n            }\n        jssor_slider1.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, DisplayHideArrow);\n\n```\n.

Please see my second comment.\nTo stop slider from looping, please set $Loop option to false.\n. It won't move even you click arrow button?\n. There are some errors in your code.\nThere are double slider1_container and double initialization scripts. And there is no begin '<script>' for the second script block.\nAlso, please always specify size in pixel.\nSo, please replace 'width: 100%' with 'width: 1300px' or something else.\n. please just place the following code just under var jssor_slider1 = new $JssorSlider$(...; statement.\n``` javascript\n       function DisplayHideArrow(index) {\n            var hideLeftArrow;\n            var hideRightArrow;\n        if (index == 0) {\n            hideLeftArrow = true;\n        }\n        else if (index == jssor_slider1.$SlidesCount() - 1) {\n            hideRightArrow = true;\n        }\n\n        jQuery(\".jssorb08l\").css(\"visibility\", hideLeftArrow ? \"hidden\" : \"visible\");\n        jQuery(\".jssorb08r\").css(\"visibility\", hideRightArrow ? \"hidden\" : \"visible\");\n    }\n\n    jssor_slider1.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, DisplayHideArrow);\n\n    //hide arrow left at the beginning.\n    DisplayHideArrow(0);\n\n```\n. No such problem found.\nPlease describe the problem in detail. Thanks!\n. Updated firefox to 32.0.2. Still no problem found.\n. @ramalingeshwarrao Please post detailed information here, thanks in advance.. You can use 'data-u' instead of 'u'.\n. I checked it again, you are right.\nCustom attributes are allowed only in html5.\n. Thanks for your update and let me check it out.\n.

But if a caption specified\n    with 'b' explicitly, it breaks the streamline.\nNote: 'du', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'r' and 'f' can be percentage value, if a percentage value\nis specified, the final behavior is a percent of original transition.\nReference: http://www.jssor.com/development/slider-with-caption-jquery.html\n. Yes, it should be 'jQuery plugin slider'. Thanks!\n. There are too many files in the package. As transition viewer is a tool, I guess it's OK to keep the css in the file.\n. Do you think this help?\njavascript\nvar scaleFactor = jssor_slider1.$ScaleWidth() / jssor_slider1.$OriginalWidth();\nPlease check it out here,\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5603615/get-the-scale-value-of-an-element\n. I changed version in both release 17.0 and 'master' branch.\nPlease check it out.\n. jssor.slider.min.js is jquery independent version, which contains more api for the privilege to use jssor slider without jquery.\nwith jssor.slider.min.js, $Jssor$ is accessible. And some methods like $Jssor$.$AddEvent are available to use.\nTo keep the package (install via bower) simple, it is not included. But it is available to download at http://jssor.com\njssor.player.ytiframe.min.js is to embed youtube video in jssor slider.\n. What's your chrome version? And Android version? And WebKit version?\n. I see.\nPlease set $HWA to false and then check the performance with your browser.\n. As the resize event be handled while window resize only, it should not be the reason.\nAnd note that responsive settings are all the same for full width slider and other sliders.\nI will investigate this issue.\nMany thanks!\nBtw, as you said it happens only on full width slider. May you compare the performance between 'simple slider' and 'slider with slideshow'?\n. @husayt Do you display the slider on TV? What's the screen resolution? And screen refresh rate (60HZ, 75HZ etc.)?\n. @CoDEmanX\nIt seems there is a big improvement when I use RequestAnimationFrame (jssor.js line 2463) to play animation.\nPlease download the test package and have a test. http://www.jssor.com/jssor.slider.testpack.zip\nPlease double check $HWA option for full width slider. And make sure to clear browser cache when you swith $HWA option.\n. Ah, right.\nPlease replace $HWA = false, with $HWA: false,\n. I tested again with Samsung galaxy note 4.\nIt works ok.\nChrome 38.0.2125.102\nAndroid 4.4.4; SM-N9100 Build/KTU84P\n. OK, let's investigate the full width slider then.\nThe full width slider uses large dimension images. Please use smaller images (which were used in other examples) to have a test.\nAlso, what's performance with the native android browser instead of chrome 38?\n. Please try to remove content in slide and simply keep the main image in the slide.\n. Great Job, Cheers!\nI will go for some test cases later.\nThanks a lot!\n. I guess you added '-webkit-transform: translateZ(0)' to text element.\nWhat about '-webkit-transform: perspective(2000px)' instead?\n. For hwa, i used 'translateZ' at the beginning. And later changed to 'transform: perspective: (2000px)' to improve performance for Safari 5.1.7 (windows version).\nI didn't realize 'perspective: 2000px' before. It may be the correct way then.\nI disabled HWA for chrome (temporarily) now to prevent low performance devices from crash.\nI will investigate more and then enable HWA for latest devices (maybe android 4.4 or later). And allow user to disable HWA manually by setting $HWA to false.\nThanks again!\n. Yes, I noticed that there is an arrow on top of the list which allows user to navigate.\nIn jssor slider, the list is a kind of thumbnail navigator, you can add arrows to thumbnail navigator as well.\nPlease see http://www.jssor.com/demos/thumbnail-navigator-with-arrows.html\nAny idea?\n. Ah, I see. I will make change for the example.\nThere is an option $Loop. Please try to set it to 0.\n. There is an api $SetCaptionTransitions which allows you set new transitions.\nIf you set an empty array as new transitions, it will disable caption animation.\nSee the following example,\n``` javascript\n    function SliderParkEventHandler(slideIndex, fromIndex) {\n        jssor_slider1.$SetCaptionTransitions([]);\n    }\njssor_slider1.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, SliderParkEventHandler);\n\n```\n. Right, it is an example.\nYou can control it more precisely.\nGiven a slider with 2 captions play 2 transitions at the beginning.\njavascript\n        var _CaptionTransitions = [];\n        _CaptionTransitions[\"transition-1\"] = { code1 };\n        _CaptionTransitions[\"transition-2\"] = { code2 };\nTo disable animation for caption 1, you can remove 'transition-1' and then call the api to set new transitions.\njavascript\n        _CaptionTransitions[\"transition-1\"] = null;\n        jssor_slider1.$SetCaptionTransitions(_CaptionTransitions);\n. Another way to do that job is to remove 'u' attribute from a caption element.\njavascript\n$(\"#caption-element-1\").removeAttr(\"u\");\n. Please set $PlayOutMode to 0.\njavascript\n$CaptionSliderOptions: {                            //[Optional] Options which specifies how to animate caption\n    $Class: $JssorCaptionSlider$,                   //[Required] Class to create instance to animate caption\n    $CaptionTransitions: _CaptionTransitions,       //[Required] An array of caption transitions to play caption, see caption transition section at jssor slideshow transition builder\n    $PlayInMode: 1,                                 //[Optional] 0 None (no play), 1 Chain (goes after main slide), 3 Chain Flatten (goes after main slide and flatten all caption animations), default value is 1\n    $PlayOutMode: 0                                 //[Optional] 0 None (no play), 1 Chain (goes before main slide), 3 Chain Flatten (goes before main slide and flatten all caption animations), default value is 1\n}\n. Thanks for your concern!\nThere are handreds of files in the package already. Css of each demo is different, I need so many css files then.\nIf you explore files in the 'skin' folder, you will see css is with html element together. That's to say, all skins are customizible.\nTo keep it simple and clear for the convenience of developer, I put all together in each demo for easy understanding.\nAnyway, developer can move css block and inline styles to css file.\nBest regards\n. You can move width and height to css, and js can get value of width and height.\n. Right, it always specifies css by inline style in javascript. It's the manner by all javascript library like jquery and other javascript library.\nBut it's not coding style, it's runtime style.\n. I see, your concern is absolutely reasonable. And many others asked the same question as well.\nI agree that inline style is not good. As there are hundreds of files in the download package, to make a template simple and easy to understand, I wrote inline styles and placed css block in the template to prevent it from messing up. It helped a lot for those who are lack of development skill.\nFor example, so many people asked the question: where to change cursor for the slider? But no one ask the same question any more when I place the style as follows,\nhtml\n<div u=\"slides\" style=\"cursor: move;\">\nNo doubt that you are experienced developer, for template, it enables developer to move inline styles to css block or css file.\nAlso, old version of jssor slider before v 16.0 can only read size of element with inline style, but for v 17.0 or later now we can move it to css block.\nSo, I will update templates and move inline styles to css block for html as follows,\nhtml\n<div u=\"prototype\" class=\"p\" style=\"POSITION: absolute; WIDTH: 72px; HEIGHT: 72px; TOP: 0; LEFT: 0;\">\n. Re: compare thumbnail-04 with -07\nThumbnail can be any format, jssor slider build thumbnails according to a prototype of thumbnail as follows,\nhtml\n    <div u=\"prototype\" ...>\n        ...\n    </div>\nAn user can customize thumbnail to any format, only html can css skills are needed to design a prototype of thumbnail.\n. Yes, DIV[u=thumbnailtemplate] is needed. It's a place holder. Which will be replaced with each individual thumbnail like <img u=\"thumb\" src=\"../img/major/s1t.jpg\" />\nAnd the extra DIV.w|c|o are optional elements. It's up to designer, a designer may remove those elements, or use less or more to make professional look. Optional elements are fully customizable.\n. Please use class name.\n```\n\n.jssor_1{\n  position:relative; \n  top:0px;\n  left:0px;\n  width:800px;\n  height:456px;\n  overflow:hidden;\n  visibility:hidden;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n\n\n```. This problem has been fixed by specifying pointerEvents: none to slideshow container.\nfor chrome 31+, firefox 31+, safari 5.1+, opera 24+, android browser 2.3+ and IE 11+.\nPlease check it out.\n. with u=\"image\" attribute specified, jssor slider will fill your image in each slide according to $FillMode.\nTo let image keep original size (or specify size manually), please remove u=\"image\" attribute.\n. Yes. With no u=\"image\" image will keep original size (or the size specified by css manually).\n. Good idea, I will add license header later.\n. I have added the comment in both jssor.js and jssor.slider.js\n. Please just remove codes between '//responsive code begin' and '//responsive code end'\n. Yes, the $AutoPlayInterval still works.\nYou can set $AutoPlayInterval for all slides, in addition, you can specify idle time for each individual slide as follows,\nhtml\n<div u=\"slides\" ...>\n    <div><img u=\"image\" src=\"image_url_1\" /></div>\n    <div idle=\"2000\"><img u=\"image_url_2\" /></div>\n    <div idle=\"3000\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"image_url_3\" /></div>\n</div>\n. Oops, I made a big mistake. Thanks a lot!\nI have just got it fixed, please download again.\n. Wow! Great job!\nI will update soon.\n. That's good idea!. Thank you very much!\n. I have just fixed problem of arrow key navigation with $Loop: 0, 2 and uploaded the package.\nAnd the following is workaround to hide arrow at begin/end,\n``` javascript\nParkEventHandler(slideIndex, fromIndex)\n{\n    if(slideIndex == 0)\n    {\n        $(\"#arrow_left\").css(\"visibility\", \"hidden\");\n        $(\"#arrow_right\").css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");\n    }\n    else if(slideIndex == jssor_slider1.$SlidesCount() - 1)\n    {\n        $(\"#arrow_left\").css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");\n        $(\"#arrow_right\").css(\"visibility\", \"hidden\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        $(\"#arrow_left\").css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");\n        $(\"#arrow_right\").css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");\n    }\n}\njssor_slider1.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, ParkEventHandler);\n```\n. You are welcome!\nThe slideo is almost ready. It enables user to create continuously playing animation just like flash.\nBut it's hard to define transition in js code. I am developing an online generation tool, the release date is approximately Sep. 1, 2015. Please keep an eye on it, it would be exciting.\n. Are there more than one sliders in one page?\nCan you post the full codes (html+javascript) that rendered in your app?\n. I see.\nYou generate html code using javascript.\nPlease copy out the code generated to see if it works.\nMy email is jssor@live.com\n. Please make sure you got the html code generated properly before you initialize (jssor_slider1 = new $JssorSlider$...) jssor slider.\nPlease post the code here.\n. Yes, you can. Is there any problem?\n. Is there any url that I can have a look?\n. $Did you set $Loop option properly?\n. Image number should be greater than display pieces to enable loop.\nIf there are totally 3 images in a slider, and all them have been displayed, then there is no chance to loop.\n. What do you mean 'on focus'?\n. I guess the 'focusin' and 'focusout' events should be detected outside jssor slider.\nWhen you detect the slider is 'focusin', please call jssor_sldier1.$Pause();\nAnd call 'jssor_slider2'.$Play() when the slider is 'focusout'.\n. ``` html\n    <div u=\"slides\" ...>\n        <div id=\"slide_0\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/01.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_1\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/02.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_2\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/03.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_3\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/04.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_4\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/05.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_5\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/06.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_6\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/07.jpg\" /></div>\n        <div id=\"slide_7\"><img u=\"image\" src=\"../img/landscape/08.jpg\" /></div>\n    </div>\n\n```\n``` javascript\n            function SliderParkEventHandler(slideIndex, fromIndex) {\n                var slideElement = document.getElementById(\"slide_\" + slideIndex);\n                var anchorElements = document.getElementsByTagName(\"A\");\n            for (var i = 0; i < anchorElements.length; i++) {\n                anchorElements[i].setAttribute(\"tabIndex\", i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        jssor_slider1.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, SliderParkEventHandler);\n\n```\n. I tested on ie, firefox and chrome. It works OK.\nBtw, is slideshow enabled in your slider?\nNote that the index of the first slide is 0, index of the second slide is 1.\n. Please use this one http://www.jssor.com/testcase/full-screen-slider-new-api.source.html\nNote that please make the original slider bigger to prevent images/text from blurring.\n. So, it would be OK if you scale text from large size to smaller size.\n. I will think about it.\n. To make slider with non-blurry text, please set $HWA to false. And make the size of original slider bigger, and make font-size bigger.\nFor example, make the slider at original size 3000 x 1500 with font-size: 100px.\nSee http://www.jssor.com/testcase/non-blurry-text-slider.source.html\nBtw, I found font-size is 64px in your demo.\n. It's OK to jsut set $HWA to false.\n. For better experience of touch device, drag with orientation 3 will fall back to 1.\nAnd for better performance of ie 11, it will fall back to 1 as well.\n. Please note that jssor.slider.mini.js = (jssor.js + jssor.slider.js). Not need to include the 'jssor.js' as a main file.\nSo the original bower.json is correct.\n. If you run jssor.slider.mini.compress.bat, you will compress (jssor.js + jssor.slider.js) to jssor.slider.mini.js\n. Why 'display: none;'?\n. I have just got it fixed. Please download and use the latest jssor.slider.mini.js\n. I have just fixed the issue. Please download again.\n. There is no blur effect at the moment. Thanks for your concern, I will consider this feature later.\n. It's free!\nMIT License https://github.com/jssor/slider/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt\n. You can embed any kind of player into jssor slider.\nhtml code\nhtml\n<div u=\"player\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 390px; overflow: hidden;\">\n    <!-- playerinstanceelement is various according to video provider, for youtube, it is 'iframe'. Anyway, it is fully customizable -->\n    <yourplayerelement pHandler=\"yourPlayerHandler\"></yourplayerelement>\n</div>\n``` implementation\nvar $JssorPlayer$ = window.$JssorPlayer$ = window.$JssorPlayer$ || new $JssorPlayerClass$();\n$JssorPlayer$[\"yourPlayerHandler\"] = function (playerElement, playerInstanceElement) {\n    var _This = this;\n_Self.$Play = function () {\n};\n\n_This.$Pause = function () {\n};\n\n_This.$SeekTo = function (time, force) {\n};\n\n_This.$Enter = function () {\n    //enter and make the player on service to audience\n};\n\n_This.$Quit = function () {\n    //quit and make the player off service to audience\n};\n\n_This.$Enable = function () {\n    //enable player to allow audience act on 'quit cover' and 'close button'\n};\n\n_This.$Disable = function () {\n    //disable player to disallow audience act on 'quit cover' and 'close button'\n};\n\n_This.$IsPlaying = function() {\n};\n\n_This.$IsEntered = function() {\n    //let jssor slider know if the player is on service.\n};\n\n{\n    //your code here\n    //....\n}\n\n}\n```\nThen your player is ready now.\n. In addition, with your player element, you can optionally add a cover image above your player. Also, you can optionally add a close button above your player as follows,\n``` html\n\n\n<!-- play cover begin (optional, can remove play cover) -->\n<div u=\"cover\" class=\"videoCover\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; background-color: #000; background-image: url(../img/play.png); background-position: center center; background-repeat: no-repeat; filter: alpha(opacity=40); opacity: .4; cursor: pointer; display: none; z-index: 1;\"></div>\n<!-- play cover end -->\n\n<!-- close button begin (optional, can remove close button) -->\n<style>\n    .closeButton { background-image: url(../img/close.png); }\n    .closeButton:hover { background-position: -30px 0px; }\n</style>\n<div u=\"close\" class=\"closeButton\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 1px;\n    width: 30px; height: 30px; background-color: #000; cursor: pointer; display: none; z-index: 2;\">\n</div>\n<!-- close button end -->\n\n\n```\nNote that this feature has been done, you don't need to write any code to support this feature.\n. I am now working on jssor slideo + generation tool.\nIt would be highly appreciated if you can help to implement vimeo video player.\n. Hope the following urls help.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44893806/jssor-auto-play-video\nhttp://www.enaelectronics.ca/.

Hi @jssor , I just noticed that slideshow stops because of a missing image. Is it possible just to ignore it and move on? I am using lazy loading, so it might be difficult to check links in advance.

It's strange enough that with the $GoTo function doesn't reload images. As long as the image is still in the DOM, I don't really understand why $AutoPlay would load it again and again.\nUnfortunately, putting $AutoPlay on false is not an option. If I would trigger click on thumbnails to simulate $AutoPlay, I'm missing the fade transition.\nAlso, it seems that I get the same behavior in Mozilla too, along with loading all the images at once, even if all the images have only src2.\n. Removing the $SlideshowOptions stops the continuous loading (when not using src2). Any idea why it goes berserk when they are set? \n. Thank you! :)\n. Just to help you, maybe I should tell you that with version 15.0 in Mozilla the images don't load continuously, even if the $SlideshowOptions are set.\n. Yes, but that's true only for realease 15.0. With 16.0 Mozilla too loads the images continuously.\n. Windows 7 - Chrome Version 35.0.1916.153 m\nIn IE, Safari and Firefox everything's ok.\n. Screen  size: 1366 x 768.\nThe original width of the slider is 1300px, from which it scales down or up.\nStrangely enough, it starts hiding the right arrow when window.width >= 1340px;\n. I did all that, but the problem is still there and the right arrow is showing up only during the transition, then it hides away :\n\n. I made some tests in Chrome, adjusting in the inspector the \"right\" style attribute of the right arrow. Maybe it helps:\n\n. Wow. You're the best! Thanks!\n. It might be something on my part and not the $SetScaleWidth function.\n. ",

Would you consider adding a support for dynamically extending/shrinking container of slides?\n. Sorry, I didn't realise you have a lazy loading mechanism through the jquery option $LazyLoading and html attribute src2 on the img. Could you correct me if I'm wrong?\nMy goal is to have a slider with N images. I'd like the webpage to load as fast as it can, so I do the first \n<img u=\"image\" src=\"/xoxoxox/gogog.jpg\" />\nand then\n<img u=\"image\" src2=\"/xoxoxox/gogog.jpg\" />\nfor the rest of the images. \n- Do I understand correctly, that the web page will be loaded with one image only, and then the rest of them will be loaded dynamically as the slideshow goes?\n- And $LazyLoading will fetch the specified number of images proactively?\n. One part which I'm still missing is the purpose of src2 attribute of img html tag. Do I get it right that it is used in tandem with $LazyLoading, so to speak if all img 's have src tags, then not depending on the value of $LazyLoading, all of them will be loaded at once during the web page load and only if an img has src2 attribute instead of src, then $LazyLoading comes into play? \n. Cool! Could you also shed a little light on $DisplayPieces for me? Do I get it right that the value of $DisplayPieces identifies how many slides will be shown at once in the container, such as here? And it is also capped by the total width of the container, such that if\nslideWidth * $DisplayPieces > containerWidth\nthen $DisplayPieces value is altered to fit the container?\n. Thank you!!! This is an absolutely gorgeous project!\n. See $EVT_PARK in the official doc\njssor_slider.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, function(currentIndex, previousIndex) {\n   if( currentIndex == jssor_slider.$SlidesCount() - 1 ) {\n     // hit the last slide, hide the right arrow\n   } else {\n     // not the last slide, show the right arrow\n   }\n   if( currentIndex == 0 ) {\n      // hit the first slide, hide the left arrow\n   } else {\n      // not the first slide, show the left arrow\n   }\n.

I noticed that problem occurs only when has a attribute u-image. Captions stay stuck outside div and transition between the banners not occurs. The problem is nor that basic setup is not working.\nThis modified opencart has many... many js scripts. You would more suggestions?\nfor now, i'll try copy some sort of css and try reproduces the problem.\nEDIT: (when i says nor that basic setup is not working, this meaning that default basic page in jssor page sample not work )\n. @jssor sorry bother you. I commented some scripts (manyyyyy) of my work partner and jssor works again.

    "guari": "Hi @jssor , thank you for quick reply! I got it half-working with the solution posted on the first link.\nIt's still an 'hack' because the slider container goes off screen, and so the navigation arrows must be removed and all the captions have to be resized and centered 'manually' into the window's resize callback (and that's a bit tricky), but it seems to work for most cases.\n. Yes, that function looks perfect. The weird issue was that if it's used an ID selector to assign styles to the slider container, then some components of the slider become screwed up without throwing errors.\nEg. try to run the following code and watch the navigator position, the style for slider1_container is applied correctly but the navigator is drawn out of the slider (hidden). The code is the same of full-width-slider.source.html with the style assigned not-inline. If the style for the container is set inline or by using a class then everything works as expected.\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nFull Width Slider - Jssor Slider, Slideshow\n",

Does not seem to make any difference whether I set it to true or false.\nHere's a screencapture: http://youtu.be/2ELWhF0SUhE\nCould it be related to the zoom settings? Maybe this should be used for mobile devices:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\">\nIt could also be the JavaScript that automatically adjusts the slider width to the viewport width, maybe there are too many resize events handled. It should be enough to check like every 250ms for a change and abort if viewport width is still the same.\n. Simple slider runs smooth as butter, slider with slideshow is a bit choppy, but the full-width example is way worse (slider with slideshow does never hang, in contrast to the full-width one).\nWhat is the difference between both?\nOverlay cover works great, except that there are thin lines around the borders:\n\nChoppy examples:\n- banner rotator 2\n- banner slider\n- different size photo slider\n- image gallery\n- image gallery with vertical thumbnail (very sluggish!)\n- simple fade slideshow\nAll other examples work very well!\n. Can't see any difference.\nTurning HWA off breaks the slider completely:\nvar options = {\n            $HWA = false,\n            $FillMode: 2,\n. Doh, of course!\nBut with HWA off it's even choppier, if turned on not as bad but still rather sluggish. How is it possible? \nMost of the other examples work great, and it doesn't really matter if you zoom in or not. With the ones I listed above, it gets more choppy the more I zoom in.\n. Maybe it's just the image dimensions, that definately possible. VRAM is limited, so they might be too large for the GPU to get full HWA. Will try lower res images.\nChrome for Android is my native browser, I can try Dolphin and Firefox however.\nI can try without content, but I doubt that's causing that much issues, because the animated captions work super smooth.\n. Wow, I didn't expact this: I removed the slide contents and it went to high-speed. Then I added back the static captions - and dang: choppy as hell!\nI tried text-rendering: optimizeSpeed; http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-rendering/\nbut didn't help anything.\nSo I added the null-transform hack directly to the text divs and it became very fast again.\nMy conclusion: text rendering, especially while zoomed in, is very expensive in combination with translating things around, maybe it's the text + slider image compositing?\nThe animations in the slide content are silky smooth, it's choppy if I swipe however. I believe it's the text again, not the animation of imgs.\nAnother reason could be layout trashing: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/\nIdeally, static text + slide background would become a single texture that is uploaded to GPU for great performance, and additional content put on top, but maybe in groups too so it can be animated as a whole (translate, rotate, scale, change opacity). I dunno what Chrome is actually doing, whether it combines the text + image into one compositing layer with the null-transform hack applied, or if they are kept separated all the time and blended together later on...\n. I tried all three combinations of perspective: 2000px and transform: translateZ(0) and it only boosted performance when I used both at the same time.\nI did not use a browser prefix (-webkit-).\n-webkit-transform: perspective(2000px) doesn't look right, I assume you mean -webkit-perspective: 200px? http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_perspective.asp\nRemark about the \"go faster\" hack: http://aerotwist.com/blog/on-translate3d-and-layer-creation-hacks/ (limited VRAM may not be a concern on your Galaxy Note or my Nexus, but other less powerful devices)\n.

    "Aybee": "This is real bad to have CSS inline. If you debug with e.g. firebug you can't see which style=\"\" gets generated by JS and which one was there before. Each template should have is own style.css with commented mandatory and custom CSS and there should be no inline style or STYLE-tag.\nBTW The third (JS generated) DIV gets no width and height if you move all inline styles to a CSS file.\nhtml\n<div id=\"slider1_container\">\n  <div style=\"...\">\n    <div style=\"... no width and height here\">\n. But in your examples you also don't have this third DIV, it gets generated by JS and in your example this third DIV then gets the inline width by JS.\nAnd you sadly ignored the fact, that debuging is almost impossible and it's no good coding style.\n. It's not the manner of a library, its the manner of JS. JS always changes CSS dynamicaly by adding inline style.\njavascript\ndocument.getElementById('issuecomment-66901401').style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n\"Bad coding style\" refers to inline style in templates before JS runs (not after), STYLE tag as child of BODY, sometimes uppercase CSS properties, missing quotes for attribute values, invalid HTML attributes... to name a few.\nhtml\n<body>\n  <style>\n  ...class=w...src2=\"xxx\"...\ncss\nstyle=\"POSITION: absolute; WIDTH: 12px; HEIGHT: 12px;\"\nI was positively surprised when I saw those nice slideshow templates, tested them in my Galaxy S2 Android 4.1.2 and they all worked. So this was the future slideshow to use for me.\nBut setting up a slideshow that reacts as I wanted to was nearly impossible. Us as developers need to know the minimum requirements of markup and sometimes also a little of what JS does behind the scenes. The markup of the templates sometimes differs and we don't know why. e.g. compare thumbnail-04 with -07\n``` html\n thumbnail-04 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04 reduced \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n thumbnail-07 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07 reduced \n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nI'm working with Contao CMS (http://contao.org/) and like to integrate jssor into it maybe later as an extension. Therefore we need a clear basic markup so that in the end we can do the styling and settings simply by setting the JS options and applying a custom CSS to the slideshow.\nI struggled on trying to setup a thumbnail behavior like this one http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow/ . But this will be another ticket which I will open in future when jssor gets cleaned up.\n. > @jssor Any good idea? Where can we place runtime style?\nTalking about CSS generated by JS? Inline style is the common way and nice to debug during developement.\n. That means the DIV[u=prototype] is all that jssor needs so far for building up the thumbnails? If so, that's a good info for a developer.\nBut it looks like DIV[u=thumbnailtemplate] is also needed and this is the placeholder for the thumb image. Am I right? And the extra DIV.w|c|o are some DIVs that you added for specific styling?\n. ",

    "alexangas": "When a user tabs using the keyboard into the picker, it needs to pause. So my guess is to make use of a focus event (I'm not sure if focusin or focus is more appropriate).\nI did some hacking around after posting this and added the following lines after the mouseout and mouseover event bindings:\njavascript\n$Jssor$.$AddEvent(elmt, \"focusin\", MainContainerMouseEnterEventHandler);//function() { console.log('focusin!'); });\n$Jssor$.$AddEvent(elmt, \"focusout\", MainContainerMouseLeaveEventHandler);//function () { console.log('focusout!'); });\nThis at least pauses the slider but obviously as we are not dealing with mouse events here it doesn't behave correctly in other ways.\nTo implement this properly, it may be necessary to create new event handlers (similar to the existing mouse handlers) but specific to focus events.\nWhat are your thoughts? Is there a better approach?\n. Based on your advice, I used the following code which works as specified:\n``` javascript\nvar jssor_slider1 = new $JssorSlider$('slider', options);\n$Jssor$.$AddEvent(jssor_slider1.$Elmt, \"focusin\", function () {\n    console.log('focusin');\n    jssor_slider1.$Pause();\n});\n$Jssor$.$AddEvent(jssor_slider1.$Elmt, \"focusout\", function () {\n    console.log('focusout');\n    jssor_slider1.$Play();\n});\n```\n. Thanks for that great code snippet. I wasn't setting IDs on the slide elements so my brain wasn't working in that way but now I can see your point. Unfortunately i've applied your approach and still have problems.\nIn the below code snippet I set all anchors to have tabindex=-1, then update all anchors in the current slide element to have tabindex=0. The former works correctly but the latter does nothing, all anchors stay with tabindex=-1. I've tried in IE and Firefox with two different approaches (you can see one of them commented). Hopefully I've made some dumb mistake that will be obvious to you. I have some concerns that it will work as there seems to be a copy of the slider elements in the DOM so therefore the IDs are not unique - maybe it is picking up the wrong one? Anyway, I value your advice:\n``` javascript\naquanetSlider.$On($JssorSlider$.$EVT_PARK, function (slideIndex) {\n    var anchorElements,\n        slideElement,\n        anchorIndex,\n        anchorElement;\nconsole.log('PARK: slideIndex=' + slideIndex);\n\nanchorElements = aquanetSlider.$Elmt.getElementsByTagName(\"a\");\nconsole.log('Number of anchorElements: ' + anchorElements.length);\nfor (anchorIndex = 0; anchorIndex < anchorElements.length; anchorIndex++) {\n    console.log('setting tabindex of anchor with index ' + anchorIndex + ' to -1');\n    anchorElement = anchorElements[anchorIndex];\n\n//          anchorElement.removeAttribute(\"tabIndex\");\n//          anchorElement.setAttribute(\"tabIndex\", \"-1\");\nanchorElement.tabIndex = -1;\n    }\nslideElement = document.getElementById(\"aquanet-slider-slide-\" + slideIndex);\nanchorElements = slideElement.getElementsByTagName(\"a\");\nconsole.log('Number of anchorElements: ' + anchorElements.length);\nfor (anchorIndex = 0; anchorIndex < anchorElements.length; anchorIndex++) {\n    console.log('setting tabindex of anchor with index ' + anchorIndex + ' in slideIndex ' + slideIndex + ' to 0');\n    anchorElement = anchorElements[anchorIndex];\n\n//          anchorElement.removeAttribute(\"tabIndex\");\n//          anchorElement.setAttribute(\"tabIndex\", \"0\");\nanchorElement.tabIndex = 0;\n    }\n});\n```\n.

This demo works fine because you are using your source code:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../js/jssor.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../js/jssor.slider.js\"></script>\nbut it did not work with the compressed files that I download from the github, my guess is you need to update the compressed files with this update.\nThank you\n. I uploaded the full package Jssor.Slider.FullPack and it worked with the fix I noticed the JS files updated on this file in 3/7 while the github file slider-master is updated on 3/6. Anyway, fixed and thank you.\n. Thank you for all your detailed replies, really great project.\n. it is already set to 2 in the code above $Loop: 2.\n. ",

    "Rendez": "That makes sense. I have to say when I look at the timeline, it looks very optimized, I think you might be right that new browsers are very optimized to change some style properties.\n\nHowever, repainting seems to be something the browser does multiple times through the entire span while the animation lasts, see the large empty green bar. This is done in a separate worker which makes the animation faster. More about that here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/27426601/558180\nFurthermore, here are the properties that affect Layout/Paint/Composite upon change: http://csstriggers.com/\nFor mobile devices, I am wondering if translate3D would avoid that long \"paint\" line which would overall increase a bit the cycles for slow iPhones and slow Androids. I don't think new devices would benefit much, as they have incredibly fast CPU/GPU IO.\nAt the moment, is translate3D being used for webkit < 543 you say?\nCheers!\n.

I am not very familiar with audtitting so I would love to learn more about what you mean.. @graingert So do you mean if jssor included a code audit it would be alright to request the uncompressed source file?\nPersonally, I want the uncompressed source file so I can learn from it, or add or debug anything in the future. Then in production, the code would be minified.. @graingert Isn't jssor Open Source since it is using the MIT license?

I was curious if the issue was happening with the old version we were using (before the new code), so I tried v20.0.0 and the multiple page request issue is no longer occurring. I will work my way down and see when the issue was introduced.. Ok, I found that older versions up to 21.1.5 will try to request a null image vs reloading the page again. Weird right? Well the issue is because I was trying to remove the src and data-src2 attributes for the first image of the slider so jquery.lazy could lazy load images as they appear in the viewport via data-src attribute. So the temp fix is leave the data-src2 as is and suffer the loading of all the first slider images (typically multiple sliders per page). \nIt would be cool if you could add a fix to not do anything if src and data-src2 weren't available or some type of viewport detection algorithm. Thanks.. I found that version > 21.1.5 will issue a request to the page hosting the slider if there is no src attribute (all slider images should be set to data-src2 for lazyloading).

Oh right sorry was being blind, yeah ofc myslide is one of the slides.\nAh I see, I guess the thing I'm trying to achieve won't be possible.
