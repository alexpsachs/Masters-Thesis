I don't intend to add this at the moment. Once the site is using backbone it should be easier to add so I'll rethink it then.\n. I'm sorry, I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Can you explain in another way what you had difficulty with?\n. I'm not sure what the issue is here. Please open another with a more clearly stated problem.\n. Yep. Good idea. Will do.\n. :hammer: \n. I've started modularizing the snippets into underscore templates, in preparation for converting this to a backbone.js app:\n``` html\n  data-content=\"<%=\n  popoverTemplate({items: [\n    {label: 'Label Text'  , type: 'text' , id: 'label'       , value: label },\n    {label: 'Placeholder' , type: 'text' , id: 'placeholder' , value: placeholder },\n    {label: 'Help Text'   , type: 'text' , id: 'help'        , value: helptext }\n    ]})                      %>\"\n\n Text input\n<%= label %>\n\n<%= helptext %>\n\n\n```\n\nThat way things will be much easier to add / keep up with the main bootstrap version.\nPopover options can be type text, textarea, select, checkbox etc. each with their own respective templates.\nIt's a bit of a mess at the moment but I'll put up another branch when things start to get organized. Been wrapping my head around how I want to lay this out in backbone so it's taking a little longer than expected.\n. OK I added required as a checkbox for the input elements.\n. I'm hesitant to add too many of these, I think things like validation patterns are better added to the generated source. I don't want the popup to be too cluttered.\n. Please create a separate issues for these requests. I'm not convinced validation patterns belong in the basic form builder, but a dropdown to select \"type\" eg. text, email, url sounds good.\n. This is something better served by another library, and added later.\n. Thanks for the commit!\nYes, I'm rewriting this, but I will be happy to merge anything which improves the current version.\nIt's quite hard to see what changed if the entire file is replaced.. Is it possible to make a commit with only the parts you added?\n. Also some other things which need fixing before I pull:\n- having an id set by default to eg. \"text\" means that you will have overlapping id's if you don't set them.\n- The form in the popover isn't being populated by the id / name if it is set \n  - i.e. set an id -> save -> click again to set id & it's blank.\n- mixed tabs & spaces\n- some formatting issues but not too important - I can reformat later\n. - spaces & tabs.. and \n- git config core.autocrlf = true (It's really hard to see what you committed the first time because windows added a lot of ^M's to every line)\n- If the id/name $(e).val() is set to \"\", we need to $(value).removeAttr(\"id\").removeAttr(\"name\") \n. This is included as part of rewriting the tool using bootstrap.\n. Having blank (id / name) attributes isn't considered valid HTML.\n. You mean a set of combined inline elements? Eg. Two text inputs, an input and select etc.\n. No, unfortunately that would require pretty extensive changes to the drag & drop.\nSupporting two dimensions as it were.\nSorry but apart from perhaps offering some pre-made two column options, that's outside the scope of this quick & dirty tool.\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this. What did you enter for your values? Can you give me the steps it took to make it break?\n. Thanks Kurt, let me know if you see it again. Also, if possible, when you see it happening can you let me know if there's any message in the Javascript console? It might be throwing an error which will make it easier to track down.\nThe code is not well organized, but the two long if / else trees are where you want to be looking, along with the \"vartype\" data attribute which tells the function how to create the item from the popover values and vice versa.\n. Hmm.. Maybe this has to do with the \"group\" name being the same.. try changing the group name of the inline radios before adding the others.\n.

Ah, I should add this to the readme:\n- In the js/data/yaml folder are yaml files each, of which corresponds to a tab in the form builder.\n- If you just want to add a new element you need to:\n  - describe it in one of these files\n  - parse the yaml to json using parse.rb in the same folder\n  - create a corresponding template in the templates/snippet directory\n  - add the template to snippet-templates.js\n- If you want to add a new tab, you'll also need to adjust the app.js file to make sure the tab is loaded.\nAdding a new type for the popover is much more involved.

    "craighooghiem": "I personally rebuilt this entire thing with this method in mind. I can now re-populate the form based on data stored somewhere (file, database, etc) and it works again.\nThere are a couple things that need to happen though - the whole system has to work as an \"instance\" so that you can apply the javascript after you append the contents, otherwise the form builder won't work when you reload the existing data. I also had to do this so I can have multiple form builders on one page of my CMS applications.\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure how I can re-package what I've done to share it back, since it's 100% deviated from what you have here and tied to a CMS database. The point I'm trying to make is that it's quite possible, just needs a tweak to re-load the data into the form builder and it should work. \n. This came up in discussion earlier.. I think there's a StackOverflow question on the matter also.\nWhat you built this for and what it can be used for are two very different things. I am using it as part of a CMS that allows the user to create (and later on edit) forms for the front-end of their website. \nSo, I adjusted the generate functions so that the database now stores the \"post generate\" code that is clean and useful on the front-end of the website, but I also stored the un-edited code in the database so I can re-load a form from the database, populate that side of the form with the old markup and then make any changes necessary.\nWorked out quite well when it was all said and done. \n. This wouldn't be that difficult to implement. Which validation attributes do you want added/removed specifically?\nOr are you just referring to things like required, email, etc?\n. Waiting until after the weekend to look at this. Minikomi discussing some overhaul changes.\n. This makes sense. I think it's a good way to do it.\nI'm not so sure about the backbone part, but if it works then that's perfect for most people.\n. It looks reasonable to me. However, the whole thing is being rebuilt right now and possibly being ported to backbone.\nI've asked him to look at adding name and ID fields as this is an oversight for a form generator.\nFor my personal build I basically did what you did. \n. I believe this is an issue with the new version of Bootstrap, because they added an html boolean value to the JS.\nhttp://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers \nNow you have to add html:true to the popover in order for the HTML to be parsed, as it defaults to false.\n. No problem. Been there, had that issue, fixed it.\nI was going to file a pull-request but I'm about 9 light years away from this build now.\nI wrapped mine up into a fuelPHP CMS and it's grossly modified.\n. No it's not and it won't ever be.\nI'm moving all my projects to Laravel and letting this one die a slow death. \nIt's a block-based CMS, similar in concept to PyroCMS, but not similar in execution at all.\nHowever, with PyroCMS moving to laravel a bunch of great changes are happening for CMS therein.\n. I work for a company (Vicimus in Ontario, Canada) and I'm the manager for everything development. \nI built the CMS myself and no one else has touched it yet. It was made for clients to be able to manage the websites we create for them, so it serves it's purpose, but not much more.\n. I had this working on the previous setup.\nI'm going to look into adding it here and see if it makes sense.\nIs the backbone stuff online yet or still in development?\n. Bootstrap does not have captcha form types, so it doesn't make that much sense to include this.\nAlso, JS based captcha forms that have visible logic tend to be less secure than the alternative anyways. \nThe code generated here should be phase 1 of your form project. \nOnce the form is generated, add the captcha manually and properly and write your form processor script.\n.

I downloaded the\n```\nwindows zip package and extracted it intact, and was using the index.html.\nThe first time I went to change the options, the change would work, but\nsubsequent attempts to change the options would fail.\nThis morning, I am working with it again, and I am not seeing the same\nbehavior.\nPerhaps my system had some instability last night that the boot this\nmorning has resolved.\nIn any case, I was only seeing the issue with the radio elements, and it\nwas only the options with those (I could always change the label and group,\neven when the options issue was happening).\nI will keep an eye on this as I use it and try to narrow down more info\nif I see it happening again.\nSince you are a developer with this project, I would like to ask you\nanother, unrelated question.\nI am wanting to modify this source for my needs, specifically to change\nthe output (the result in the generated source tab)\n(no, I had not edited the source when I was seeing the issue, I have not\ntried to change it yet)\nI would like to change the output into an encoding I am working on to\nuse for another project.\nI see in fb.js in the genSource function where the output for radios and\ncheckboxes is generated, but I am wondering if you will give me a pointer\nand/or any insight to where the other elements' source is generated.\nI know eventually I could figure it out, but I figure you are already\nmuch more intimate with the code, and could likely save me a bunch of time.\nAgain, thanks for the reply, and thanks for any additional help you can\ngive.\nKurt Stevens\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Adam Moore [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Sunday, December 16, 2012 9:24 PM\nTo: minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder\nCc: truks\nSubject: Re: [Bootstrap-Form-Builder] Radio buttons in Chrome browser (#13)\nI'm having trouble reproducing this.

Thanks much for the pointer, Adam. That should help me a lot in what I want\nto do.\nWhen I was having the issue earlier, I had chrome's javascript console open,\nand I did set a breakpoint in the code to try to see what was going on, but\nI didn't have the time to put into it then.\nI do know, though, that there were no error messages.\nOk, Adam, it is doing it again right now. \nHere is exactly what I did:\n1. open index.html in chrome.\n2. select radio tab.\n3. drag an inline radio group to the form (I notice here that in my browser,\n   the first radio is checked, and it stays checked when I change the options.\n   the inline radio is the only object that has an item checked).\n4. change the options (I went from 1 2 3 to Pass Fail, and this succeeds).\n5. drag a radio buttons object (not inline) into the form below the existing\n   radio group. (when I drop the new object into the form, the first radio\n   group checked item becomes unchecked, and the first radio button in the new\n   group becomes checked!!! Interesting.).\n6. attempt to change the items in the new group, can change the label text,\n   cannot change the button items.\nSo, since this is directly after a fresh boot, directly after opening the\nbrowser, I would guess that this is real after all.\nI did this with the js console open, no error messages.\nI just refreshed the browser, and now I can't get the same result.\nThat's all I know at this point, but I forgot to mention the 'jumping\nselected radio' thing (it seems like the selected radio jumps from one group\nto the next, visually, when I drop the new group).\nI likely won't have time to work with this more today, but I will be working\non it in the future, and I will definitely be on the lookout for anything\nmore I can find out if I see this again.\nThanks for your work on this project, it definitely is a useful one, and I\nappreciate your efforts.\nKurt Stevens\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Adam Moore [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Monday, December 17, 2012 9:03 PM\nTo: minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder\nCc: truks\nSubject: Re: [Bootstrap-Form-Builder] Radio buttons in Chrome browser (#13)\nThanks Kurt, let me know if you see it again.

There is no problem here.
