    "fengyuanchen": "You can create an Angular wrapper for Viewer.js as ngCropper.\n. I don't understand what you mean exactly. \n\nViewer can work on a single image as:\nhtml\n<img id=\"image\" src=\"path/to/image.jpg\">\njs\nvar image = document.getElementById('image');\nvar options = {};\nvar viewer = new Viewer(image, options);\n. Show thumbnail is optional!. \nPlease read the description about the url option: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs#url\n. Good point. It should exit fullscreen when stop playing.\n. Yes, it is quite easy:\njs\n$().viewer({\n  url: 'src',\n  movable: false,\n  rotatable: false,\n  scalable: false\n});\n. As this issue is under the Viewer.js, I should provide a related example:\nhtml\n<div class=\"pictures\">\n  <img src=\"/path/to/picture-1.jpg\">\n  <img src=\"/path/to/picture-2.jpg\">\n  <img src=\"/path/to/picture-3.jpg\">\n</div>\njs\nvar pictures = docuement.querySelector('.pictures');\nvar viewer = new Viewer(pictures , {\n  movable: false,\n  rotatable: false,\n  scalable: false\n});\n. @searls You are right. Thanks. I will replace them with some photographs taked by myself to avoid license problem.\n. I have replaced all the example images with my own photos. Thanks all of you.\n. Good work. Thanks~\n. Thank you for the PR, but I'd like to use my own photographs to avoid license problem.\n. @stephenhandley Thank you for the PR, but I'd like to use my own photographs to avoid license problem.\n. @tmont Re-implement the Viewer.js by pure CSS?\n. @tmont As this library is built with JavaScript mainly (js: 60KB, css: 8KB), I think it is not possible for me to implement it by pure CSS.\n@stephenhandley I think using photos of landscape are more common than a specific person, and will more easy to be accept by most people.\nThank you both!\n. Thank you. I will consider it I need one later.\n. Thank you for the PR. \nBut I think the best way to fix this is that remove both http and https.\n. With <script src=\"//fengyuanchen.github.io/js/common.js\"></script>:\nIf you access http://fengyuanchen.github.io/viewerjs/, browser will load http://fengyuanchen.github.io/js/common.js.\nIf you access https://fengyuanchen.github.io/viewerjs/, browser will load https://fengyuanchen.github.io/js/common.js\n. OK. I see. Just because sometimes I cannot access github.io with https.\n. Thank you for reporting this!\n. Thank you for the suggestions.\n. I think videos are totally different to images.\n. 1) In order to keep the library small and simple, I cannot provide all the available options, so I'd like to provide the basic options only.\n2) Set the scalable option to false will disable image flipping.\n. @stephenhandley Sorry, I have to say your images are not so beautiful as my original images. Please don't pull any requests about images. Thanks!\n. @stephenhandley I think landscape photographs are more common and acceptable for most of people than a specific person, so I replaced all the pictures of Emma some days ago even though I think she is very very beautiful.\n. You can try to set both the rotatable and scalable options to false.\n. I don't understand what you said. Sorry~\n. Are you sure the other galleries had been initialized?\n. Viewer is a jQuery plugin, but Viewer.js does not require jQuery. So they are different.\n- Viewer: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewer\n- Viewer.js: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs\n. There is a mistake here. I will fix this soon. Thanks~\n. Support to custom toolbar buttons now (v0.9.0).. Thanks~\n. \u4e00\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u8fd9\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u8bd5\u8bd5\u6bcf\u6b21\u52a0\u8f7d\u5b8c\u65b0\u56fe\u7247\u540e\uff0c\u5148\u6ce8\u9500\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002\n. Were you talk about the Viewer.js?\n. What did you mean with the \"save\" word (in the title)?\n. Where is the \"save\" button?!\n. Can you provide more detail or an online demo?\n. Sorry, we don't need this feature, but you can folk one and customize it by yourself.\n. I will improve this next. Thanks!\n. Show the image loading progress to let the use know it is loading.\n. This will change the UI of the default toolbar, e.g., the bigger play button. My suggestion it keep your custom toolbar in your own project. Thanks~\n. The viewed.viewer is an event of the jQuery version: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewer\n. Thanks~\n. Not support to use it in modal yet.\n. Supports now: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs/blob/master/examples/viewer-in-modal.html. The right event is viewed, not need the .viewer suffix.\n. Please read the contributing guidelines first before send a pull request. Thanks.\n. 1. Fork the latest repo.\n2. Don't change the files in the dist directory.\n. Viewer.js does not support IE8, you can try the jQuery version which supports IE8.\n. Fixed on #33, will be released soon.\n. Call the show method after you initialized a viewer.\n. The code is fine, but you put this comment in a wrong place...\n\nThe right place: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewer\n. Just an image viewer, not work with other things.\n. Why not just use the hide method.\n. Switch images by swiping will be disabled when it only has one image.\n. https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewer\n. Supports this by default. But you should put each gallery in different containers and initialize each gallery by Viewer.js.\n. js\nnew Viewer(gallery1);\nnew Viewer(gallery2);\nnew Viewer(gallery3);\n...\nnew Viewer(galleryN);\n. http://codepen.io/cfy/pen/bwqjGQ\n. You may need to limit the number of the images.\n. @NivarnaRen Try the jQuery version please: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewer. Call the update method to add those images dynamically!\n. @KevinPan If no image at all, why not just init the viewer after the images loaded?!. As of v0.9.0, the prev and next methods support loop mode.. Here is an example for customizing toolbar with loop prev and next behaviour:\nhttps://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs/blob/master/examples/custom-toolbar.html. Try the latest version please (current: v0.9.0). I enhance the title to support to customize title content.. The viewer is appended to body in modal mode now.. Not support this. Maybe you can add a hidden img for the viewer to read.. e.detail\u90fd\u662f\u5f88\u8001\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e86. What's your mean of the \"navigate to the gallery\"?. Keyboard support only available when you open the viewer window.. More detail?. Try the latest version please.. Are you sure you were using the latest version?. It is the problem of the default dragstart event behaviour.. @kristianjohansson Thanks you very much. You just found the core mistake:\ngetPointer(touch), true) is wrong, it must be getPointer(touch, true)). You can just customize it in your own code. The Viewer.js will not support this. Sorry.. Click the right button of the mouse, and then choose the download button?. You can implement it with HTMLAnchorElement's download attribute, but only works for same-origin URLs.. @jaychapani Not support that~. @jaychapani Checkout this example which has a custom download button, but not support to download rotated images.. You might have to fix it by yourself.. \u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\u3002.

Why not just use the view(index) method?. Call the show method first, and then call the view method once the modal shown (use the shown event).. Not necessary to add this. Just use the scalable option.. For download button, you can customize it by yourself.. Good work!. Yes. It is designed as this, not an issue.. Not support this. Fork one and implement it by yourself.. Show the thumbnails first and download the full image only when view it in the viewer window, check out the demo for detail.. Try the update method:\n\njs\n// change the list\nthis.$nextTick().then(() => {\n  viewer.update()\n}). @mawenge https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3967. Works fine with base64 images. Just check your own code for the problem.. Try this:\nhtml\n<div>\n  <ul id=\"images\">\n    <li style=\"backgruond-image: url('picture.jpg');\"></li>\n    <li style=\"backgruond-image: url('picture-1.jpg');\"></li>\n    <li style=\"backgruond-image: url('picture-2.jpg');\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\njs\nconst viewer = new Viewer(document.getElementById('images'), {\n  url() {\n    return this.style.backgruondImage.match(/'(.+)'/)[1]\n  },\n});. \u652f\u6301\u3002\njs\nimport 'viewerjs/dist/viewer.css'\nimport Viewer from 'viewerjs'. \u6682\u65f6\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u505a\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u4f60\u4eec\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684PR\u4e0a\u6765\u7ed9\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4eba\u505a\u53c2\u8003\u3002.

Hide the built-in close button and create a custom button by yourself.. https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper. ```js\nvar viewer;\nimage.addEventListener('viewed', function () {\n  viewer.zoomTo(1); // Zoom to 1:1 when each image load completely\n}, false);\nviewer = new Viewer(image);\n. Sorry, I don't understand that.. https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs#browser-support. Just try it!!!. I think this case is over-designed.

Why not just override the CSS style in your app?\nFor example:\ncss\n.viewer-toolbar {\n  text-align: left; /* or right */\n}. BTW: The toolbar, navbar and  title are all center-aligned, and I think it is not a good idea to change this.\n  . It is not a common feature, so I will not merge this.

After you change the container size manually, you can trigger a resize event on window to update the viewer, or just call the internal resize method.. I saw you were using CSS Grid Layout in your demo, but IE9 does not support them.. It is hard to do this in inline mode as the viewer is placed over the target element.. The size the of the inline viewer is inherit from its parent element (container), so just change the size of parent element.. You can call the internal resize method instead of trigger a resize event on window.. This has been implemented in 1.0.0-rc..

Why replace sexy images of one celebrity with sexy pictures of another?\nMaybe the sample images should just be different shades of beige so as not to offend anyone of any kind of gender.\nAlthough, certain people might have a beige fetish, so maybe an option to switch the hue might be an easy way to ensure that people who identify as a beige fetishist won't feel like we're singling them out for being weirdos.\nPerhaps the best solution is to not show the demo by default, and start with the question \"which color is the least sexually attractive to you?\" and use that hue for the sample images. However, you'll have to reassure them that you won't be doing anything malicious with such potentially sensitive data.\nMaybe the true solution is to re-implement this whole library in pure CSS with no JavaScript whatsoever. That has the polycephalic advantage of:\n1. Ensuring users that you won't track their huesexual preferences\n2.
