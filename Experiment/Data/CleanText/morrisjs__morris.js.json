    "oesmith": "Should be fixed by f740d80c140c8f075acb72b9ee26a7e63b37af36 - I've added YYYY-MM parsing.\nBTW, morris.js expects data that's already been sorted newest-first (ie. the opposite order of your example above).\nHope that helps!\n. Heh, no worries! :)\n. GH-pages branch.\n. I've re-written it in coffee-script.  It's a bit prettier.\n. Cool!  I'll merge these later.\n. I've pulled your new examples into the main source tree, and somewhat inspired by your start on the documentation, I've put up a proper site at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js\nAlso note, there's been a couple of small API changes too.  Check the docs! :)\n. Thanks for this (and the Makefile too!).\n. Morris expects your data to be sorted so the most recent point is first in the array. Switching your sort order should fix your problem.\n(and I should probably add a .sort somewhere in the code so the order of points passed in doesn't matter)\n. No worries :)\n(and I've opened #10 to deal with the sorting)\n. Done in fc4ff279a5 - YAY!\n. Done in dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Merged - thanks!\n. I posted an update to the website an hour or so ago - it should be there by now!\n. Can't believe I missed that one - thanks!\n. Thanks.  I've merged and done a little bit of refactoring - see dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Yup, that's the plan. There's also some refactoring to be done in the rendering code to cope with a different date format internally.\n. Fantastic! :)\nI'm planning to move to proper javascript timestamps for the internal time representation, but I think this should be OK to merge in the meantime.  I'll have a proper look later.\nThe axis labelling needs a refactor too -- the site I originally build morris.js for was only concerned with annual data, so there's only labels at year boundaries.  In #9 I'll make the labelling a lot smarter, so it should be able to work out the correct labelling intervals automatically.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5!\n. Should be fixed now in master.  A nuance in the implementation got missed when I translated to coffeescript.  Schoolboy error on my part!\n. Try sorting your data in order of newest first.  This should fix your problem.\nAlternatively, wait for me to close issue #10!\n. I'm currently working on doing that -- please see issue #9.\n. I'm not seeing that same behaviour here.\nCould you post some example code, and let me know which browser you're using?\n. here is some example code, which works fine in all the browsers I can get my hands on (even IE6).\nClosing this issue.\n. That's not something that I'm currently working on, but I think it's something that I'll definitely get around to doing.\nWatch this space!\n. This has just been done in 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e.\nI'll include it in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. Yes, you can supply dates in YYYY-MM format and they'll render OK.\nHowever, the x-axis labelling code needs work to properly display dates to month accuracy along the axis. At the moment it'll only label year boundaries (this should be rectified when issue #9 is finished).\n. Excellent stuff, thanks!\n. At the moment, that's not possible -- and not currently on the roadmap either.\nSorry!\n. All merged - thanks!\n. Are you using integers or strings in your x-values?\nMorris.js will attempt to sort the incoming x-values, so it may be getting the sort order messed up if they're strings.\n. I'm not sure what you're trying to do.  Can you post some example code?\n. Try replacing\ndata: [$graph],\nwith\ndata: $graph,\nAlso ensure that jQuery's properly parsing the JSON data.  If you're using Chrome or Safari, doing a console.log($graph); should dump the contents of $graph to the console, and it'll show you if it's a string (bad) or an object (good!).\n. Great - glad it's working for you now!\n. Great idea - I'll stick it on my TODO list!\n. I'm working on a refactor of the hover labels at the moment.\nFollow my work on #134.\n. For negative values, keep your eye on issue #25 - they're on my TODO list.\nFor week numbers, make sure you're using at least v0.2.3, then try either formatting them as ISO standard week numbers (ie. 2012 W11), or set the parseTime option to false to skip date parsing and treat your X values as an arbitrary stream.\n. Support for negative numbers has just been added in commit 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e\nIt'll get included in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. This is done in bcc034e152534aa8c6f8e5267c77a786ebcb127e (see the units option)\nIt'll go into v0.2.4 too\n. None of those are currently on my roadmap.\nMy philosophy is to keep morris.js as simple as possible to use, so some of those features might not ever make it into the library.  You might be better served by some of the more fully-featured (and complex) graphing libraries.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5.  Checkout the updated docs at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js/ and the example code in examples/timestamp.html.\nCheers!\n. Yeah, decimal values aren't very well supported at the moment. They're\nin my plan...\nSent from my iPad\nOn 9 Mar 2012, at 20:33, Pavel Shvedov\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nNow Morris drows a chart like http://cl.ly/0s0p0u283Z2f3j0J0A3Z for the code like\nMorris.Line({\n           element: 'u_price_quotes',\n           data: [\n{date: '2010-11-02', value: 10.83},\n               {date: '2010-11-03', value: 10.45},\n               {date: '2010-11-04', value: 10.60},\n               {date: '2010-11-05', value: 10.70}\n       ],\n       xkey: 'date',\n       ykeys: ['value'],\n       labels: ['Series A']\n   });\nSo, the value is rounded when is displayed in the label. Is there any option to disable the rounding?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/37\n. I've just committed a fix for this in 634179d.  Decimal values will no longer be rounded.\n\nIt'll get included in the next release.\n. Thanks!\nI've got a rough idea for doing something similar (one of the graphs on howmanyleft could really do with support for partial series).  I'll keep this implementation in mind when I'm hacking :)\n. Been through this today - your code was great.  Apart from a small tweak, I've merged it straight in.\nThanks!\n. At the moment, decimal values will be represented in the line, but the labels are rounded.  See Issue #37.\n. Yeah, the current labelling code is nowhere near good enough to handle anything but annual data.\nI'm refactoring the labelling code now to be smarter about this -- to determine a labelling strategy based on the range of the x-axis (so it'll increment the labels in centuries / decades / years / months / days / hours / minutes / seconds / etc depending on what the total range is).  At the same time I'm refactoring the code to accept full javascript timestamps as x-values.\nYour approach so far is pretty radically different to the one I'm planning, so I'm not going to merge this code as it stands.  I'm pretty busy at the moment though, so my code's going to take a while to complete. You might be best-off working with your fork for now until mine's ready for release.\nHope that helps!\n. Yup, I'll keep in mind relative timestamps.  They won't be in the first drop, but I'll make sure they're on the roadmap (which reminds me, I really should keep a roadmap in these issues!) :)\n. xlabelMargin as an option: great.\nYour xlabels, however, aren't ready to be merged.  A complete solution to the labelling challenge needs two further problems solved:\n- Automatically choosing the correct label steps --  If the label margin is 20 px, the width of the x axis is 200 px and the timespan is 10 years, the labels should be years.  If the timespan is a week, then they should be days.\n- The label formatting should make it obvious what the label means.  If it's months, then labelling \"2012-01\" or \"Jan\" gives the right context to understand the label. \"01\" does not.\nThanks for the contribution.  I hope we can solve these problems and get some awesome xlabel formatting!\n. Great stuff, but this isn't quite ready to merge yet.\n- Camel-case formatting on the options, please -- that means they should be drawXLabels and drawYLabels.  Also check your code, there's a mix of drawYlabel and drawYlabels, so Y-axis labelling is broken in this commit.\n- When the labelling is disabled, can you set the bounds of the drawing area to fill the element (rather than having empty space where the labels would have been).\n. This only reads the year, month, day, hour and minute parts of the time spec.  Would it not be easier to just add an optional 'T' to the middle of the regexp for YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM type?\n. I've just pushed a fix in 18b4191 - let me know if it works for you!\n. Thanks for the bug report!\nI've just committed a fix in b3ab944 - hopefully everything should be working for you now.\n. Looks great -- it's a good intermediate step towards getting properly 'magic' date/time labelling on the x-axis.\nI'll give it a whirl this evening and if it all works well, I'll merge it :)\n. Yeah, I've been considering using moment.js -- but if possible I'd like to get a solution that doesn't need another external dependency.\n. This code wasn't quite in line with the direction I've taken with my own code, so I've skipped merging it.\nHowever, my automatic x-labelling code is now merged into master -- see commit fc4ff279a5.  Let me know if it works for you guys!\n. I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to do -- I think the best way to explain this to me is in code, so do please go ahead and submit a pull request! :)\n. Sorry, that's not something that I've any real need for at the moment.\nIf you'd like, feel free to contribute some code and I'll consider including it!\nAlternatively, g.raphael can make use of the same dependencies as Morris.js and draw pies too.\nThanks,\nOlly\n. I'm totally an advocate of using Highcharts for complicated stuff too, but area charts shouldn't be complicated to add to morris.js -- I'll add them to my TODO list! :)\n. Ok, you guys win - area charts are the next thing I'll be adding to Morris. Watch this space :+1:\n. OK, area charts are now in master.\nThis example shows you how it works.\n\n. Any reason why you can't use YYYY-MM-DD HH:00 ? ;)\n. I've merged this, with one small change.  Local time is used when neither zulu time nor an offset are specified.\nThanks for your contribution!\n. This is in now -- I've made a couple of small tweaks that will affect you when you pull in the latest master branch.  Make sure you take a look at the last couple of commits.\nThanks loads for the contribution!\n. It's in!  I've made a small change to use camel-case (so the options become preUnits and postUnits), and a small refactor - see fa8f8c6.\nThanks again!\n. Currently, I think Morris.js only properly handles continuous series -- ie. there can be null values at the beginning and end of a series, but not in the middle.\nThe difficulty here is in deciding what the behaviour should be for null values -- I presume you need the line plot to be continuous (rather than have gaps where the null values are)?\n. This should be A-OK now.  Let me know if it's working for you.\n. Can you send me an example/jsfiddle showing this?\n. I can't reproduce this at all.  Changing CSS widths on the containing element in all my examples changes the corresponding width of the graph. Closing this issue.\n. Yeah, the current implementation uses a single tooltip which it moves around and rewrites the labels when you hover different points.  Refactoring that won't be straightforward...\nBest of luck -- don't forget to send a pull request when you get it working!\n. This is in, although I've removed the deep copy in favour of a shallow one (the only destructive change to the data array is sorting, so a deep copy was overkill).\nSee 942e121\n. Hi!\nThanks for the pull request....\n... however, there's no code changes needed to support more than 7 lines.  The default config for line colours in morris.js only contains 7 colours, so all you need to do is pass your own lineColors config parameter with the number of lines that you need.\nSee here: http://jsfiddle.net/MKhdW/\nHope that helps!\n. Merged at last - thanks!\n. Thanks guys - have fixed in aa67b1a and released 0.2.9.\n. Fixed in aa67b1a. Thanks!\n. Like some other pull requests I've cleared out today, I'm not convinced this one's worth the test/maintenance overhead.\nClosing.\n. This should be fixed now in master, and it'll be released in v0.2.10.\n. I've had a hack at this today, and I've added a setData() method to Morris.Line.  Take a look at the 'updating' example to see how it works.\nCurrently this is just on the master branch, but I'll include it in the next release (v0.2.10).  Let me know if it solves your problem.\n. Right now there's no code to support resizing the graph, so I'd expect 'odd' behaviour when resizing.\nCan you send me a jsfiddle that reproduces the container width and height problems you're experiencing?\n. Thanks! I've merged and released this in 0.2.10.\n. This is fixed on master now.\nI also recommend using an auto N value in the ymax and/or ymin options, so you can set the range that the graph will show when there's absolutely no variance in the data values.\n. Those kinds of requirements are way ahead of Morris.js right now. I suggest you take a look at D3.js, which would do a far better job of satisfying them.\nOlly\n. xLabelFormat is the option you're looking for (see the docs for more info).  dateFormat doesn't affect the x-axis labels because of the automatic 'smart' labelling it uses to work out the most suitable labels for the x-axis date range.\n(so bear in mind if you change xLabelFormat to always display DD. MM. YYYY., it won't look so great when the date range isn't suitable for labels of that granularity)\nHTH\nOlly\n. You may need to delay rendering until the containing element is visible on-screen.

This should be fixed in v0.3.0 (available to download now).\n. You're nearly there with removing the quotes from value -- Morris.js requires numerical values in that field.\n\nTry using a helper (or maybe a decorator?) to map #to_i against the values.\n. Something like the following, perhaps?\n``` ruby\nin application_helper.rb\ndef donut_json\n  @result_donut.map { |x| {:label => x[:label], :value => x[:value].to_i} }.to_json.to_s.html_safe\nend\n```\n.. and then, in your view\nhtml\n<script>\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: <%= donut_json %>\n});\n</script>\nDisclaimer: this is quick and dirty code, so you may want to tidy/reorganise it as you see fit.\n. I've just pushed a solution to master.  You can now pass a function to Morris.Donut to format the value however you need to.  Grab the latest morris.min.js and give this a go:\njavascript\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: /* your data here */\n  formatter: function (x) { return Math.floor(x / 60) + ':' + Morris.pad2(x % 60) }\n});\nDisclaimer: again, a quick+dirty solution - feel free to customize the formatter to fit your needs :)\n. You can use xLabelFormat to add a custom formatter for date labels.\n. The graphs won't draw properly if their container has 'display: none'.  I've worked around this in my bootstrap sites by listening for the 'shown' event on the tab and only initialising charts in the event handler.\nHTH!\nOlly\n. Try adding lineColors to your config with enough colors for all of your series (I think the default config only supports a maximum of 8ish series before it runs out of colors).\n. That last commit removes the lineColors.length >= ykeys.length requirement.  It'll cycle color values when they run out.\n. Grab the latest master, then calling select(n) on the object that Morris.Donut(...) returns.\nI've just added some code that should do what you need.\n. Whoops - my fault for coding too late at night! :)\nTry again now - should be fixed.\n. Try the latest master, I've slightly modified the ymin/ymax behaviour.  FWIW, I recommend setting ymax to auto N in these situations (where N is a sensible number for your dataset).\n. No problems - I'm glad it's working for you.\nCheers!\nOlly\nOn 26 Sep 2012, at 21:47, Monica Olinescu notifications@github.com wrote:\nThanks for the quick fix.

I'm gradually working towards getting more charts in - if you've got some specific ideas for what you'd like to see, I'd be glad to see some mockups or similar designs (or even better, some code!).\nI'd avoided including legends in the donut chart because the legend can quickly overwhelm the chart. The donut chart should be a very simple overview of the data, and if you need more information alongside it, I'd recommend adding a table or a different kind of visualisation so that its easily readable and accessible.\n. Thanks to the enthusiasm in the other thread, area charts are next on my list of priorities. Once they're out of the way I'll start investigating bars! :+1:\n. OK, basic support for bars are in now too! See #101 for details.\n. Radars are a pain in the ass (and I'm not convinced they work well on the web), so I'd rather keep them out of morris completely.\nGauges are more interesting. They're pretty simple, so should be a quick-ish job to complete. I'll add a separate issue to discuss them.\nClosing this issue now, since it's dragged on for a looooooooooooong while.\n. Nice one - thanks!\n. Good spot!  I guess I was just lucky that all my graphs with parseTime: false so far have had ordered x-keys :)\n. What are you sending to Morris in the element option?\n. Is there a <div id='stocks_chart' ... > on your page?\n. Are you running the javascript that calls Morris.Line on pages that don't contain #stocks_chart?\nMaybe move the call to Morris.Line inside an if statement that checks for the presence of #stocks_chart on the page?\n. If you're using rails assets, then it's likely that script will be on every page, yes.  I'd recommend keeping it in your assets folder, but use an if statement to stop it from executing on the wrong pages.\nSomething like this:\ncoffee-script\njQuery ->\n  if $('#stocks_chart').length\n    Morris.Line\n      element: 'stocks_chart'\n      data: $('#stocks_chart').data('stocks')\n      # ...\n. Are your YYYY time stamps strings or numbers?\nMorris will parse strings as years, and numbers as numeric time stamps.\nCan you give me an example (using jsbin or similar) of where the code doesn't work?\n. I'm not quite sure I understand the problem. Can you replicate it with some code on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net and reply with the link?\n. I've changed that first jsbin slightly to insert some dummy data rather than call the PHP code, and it appears to be working fine (I see x-axis labels)\nhttp://jsbin.com/igasid/10/edit\nDoes that work for you?\n. Try using xLabels: \"hour\" - if you force it to use day labels and the data doesn't span any boundaries between days, then you'll get no labels on the x axis.\n. Hmm.. not sure why that's happening.\nCan you paste in here the output of console.log(colors)?\n. I'm not sure what to suggest here -- I'm unable to reproduce that behaviour.\nCan you check out this jsfiddle and try to get it to show the bug?\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/bTR3j/1/\n.

I'd almost be tempted to take an approach similar to the donut chart of only showing the label for the currently selected segment.  After all, a pie chart is just an aid to visualise some tabular data -- so if all of the data is important, you'd have the table alongside the pie chart on the same page...\nHope that helps!\nOlly\n. A side-comment regarding zero values:\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n. Printing isn't a use case I've considered at all when building Morris.js. Does it work at all?\nI'm closing this PR, since it's gone stale.\n. What have you tried so far?\nPost a link to your code so far on a jsbin or jsfiddle and I'll take a look to see if I can work out what you've missed.\n. Yes, in the current version of Morris.js, you'll need to convert those d values to millisecond timestamps for dateFormat to take effect.\n(See also #90, which is for adding support for formatting string values in x labels)\n. Sorry, I meant the d values in your data should be timestamps in order for dateFormat to work.\nAnyway, I've commited a fix for #90 this morning that should help here.  If you grab the latest version from master, then the following code should work (note the value that is passed to the dateFormat callback is a timestamp, not a Date).\nMorris.Line({\n  element: 'chart',\n  data: [\n    {d: '2012-10-18', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-17', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-15', w: 1, n: 0, t: 1 },\n  ],\n  xkey: 'd',\n  ykeys: ['w', 'n', 't'],\n  xLabelFormat: function(d) {\n    return d.getDate()+'/'+(d.getMonth()+1)+'/'+d.getFullYear(); \n  },\n  xLabels:'day',\n  labels: ['Winners', 'Non-winners', 'Total'],\n  lineColors: ['#167f39','#990000', '#000099'],\n  lineWidth: 2,\n  dateFormat: function (ts) {\n    var d = new Date(ts);\n    return d.getYear() + '/' + (d.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + d.getDay();\n  }\n});\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. The ts value is just a parameter on the dateFormat function (the name doesn't matter, you could call it purple_elephants if you wanted).\nIf you grab the latest Morris.js code from the github repository, you won't need any more timestamp data.\n. Can you try with the latest master version? I've done some refactoring recently which should have fixed this issue.\n. The hover is designed to replace a fixed legend. I really don't see the value in having a partial hover and adding a legend -- it's putting redundant data on the screen.\nDo you see what I mean?\n. As I see it, the hover is showing necessary information (the series colors), even when it isn't showing values for some series.  There is an argument for making the hover less noisy and/or easier to scan when there are missing values though.\nIf you're keen to show a legend alongside the chart, then you can access the colors array from the .options.lineColors property on the object that Morris.Line returns.\n``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line(/ ... /);\nconsole.log(chart.options.lineColors); // ['#0b62a4', '#7A92A3', ...]\n``\n. I've already switched \"n/a\" for \"-\" in the hover, but I'm still not happy that it's the _right_ solution. I think it could do with some table-alignment of the series labels and values to make it a little prettier.... :confused:\n. If you resize the element that contains the graph and callredraw()on the object returned byMorris.Line`, the graph should be redrawn to fit.\nSee the documentation for window.onresize() to see how you hook into resize events in javascript.\nNote: I suggest you call redraw() sparingly as it's quite an expensive operation. Try using a setTimeout trick or similar to avoid calling it for intermediate resize events.\n. That's great, thanks!\nI'm working on area charts (and beefing up the test suite) at the moment, which is why there's been so much refactoring recently.  I'll try to get this integrated as soon as the area charts are done.\n:+1:\n. It's not possible right now, but I'm currently working on it.  See #47.\n. Right now that's not possible, but it's a sensible feature to add.\nI'll leave this issue open as a reminder.  Thanks!\n. Closed with #103\n. Cool!\nI'm going to hack on this now. I'm thinking of changing the way the x-axis scaling works for bar graphs. Instead of doing a straight time-based interpolation, I'd rather split the chart into equal-sized blocks for each entry in options.data. This should mean we don't need the padding calculations..\n. OK, take a look at e4f4594.  I've taken your work and pared it right down to the absolute bare essentials, removing some unnecessary bits that were leftover from Morris.Line and refactoring anything relating to horizontal positioning.\nTo keep the basic functionality of the bar chart clear, I've removed some of your new additions. I've no objections to any of them, I'd just like to build up the features incrementally from a really solid base.\nWhat do you think?\n\n. Looking forward to your next pull request already - thanks for all the hard\nwork! :)\nSent from my iPad\nOn 31 Oct 2012, at 22:15, Marcin Chwedziak notifications@github.com wrote:\nSweet!\nAnyway, I will still need to fork Morris.Bar because I do need gradient\nsupport for fill attribute.

Honestly, I'm not convinced this is a really necessary core addition to the library. Everybody wants their own combination of weird and wonderful coloring for their bar charts, and this only covers one aspect. My preference would be to make it completely flexible, and make options.barColors able to accept a function that generates the correct colors.\nSomething like:\njavascript\nbarColors: function (data, type) {\n  // data: series name/index, x / y values\n  // type: 'hover' or 'bar'\n  if (type === 'hover') {\n    // generate a hover color\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (type === 'bar') {\n    // generate a bar fill color\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n. I've added the callback code now -- take a look at 236afa4.\n. Looks good to me :+1:\nA couple of notes:\n- Math.min / Math.max will treat a null as a zero, so you need to be careful of passing nulls\n- I'm trying to move away from using $.map towards using coffee-script list comprehensions wherever possible (they look tidier to me :grinning:)\n(see 8faced7 for the changes I made when merging)\n. There's a lot of overlap in functionality between this and Morris.Donut.  I'd like to investigate moving some of the common code into a base class.\nI'll have a hack at this and see what I can come up with.\n. Closed by #106\n.

Finally getting around to looking at this. Looking pretty damned good so far!\nHowever, I'm not sure there's any justification for the multiple inheritance (or composition) code here - the hover methods could be declared directly on Morris.Grid, couldn't they?\n. I'm carrying on this work in the html-hover branch. See #134.\nClosing this PR now.\n. LGTM! :+1:\n. First check the element is present on the page before attempting to draw it.  \nif ($(\"#element-id\").length > 0) { .... } will help.\n. ... and the other chart?\n. This has been fixed in master. Closing.\n. Yup, this is definitely out of scope for morris.js.\n. I've done some refactoring, beefed up the tests a little and merged broken-lines into master.\nSee d41bea2 for my changes. It's nothing huge - just a little tidying in the tests, and a refactor to createPath & gradients to handle leading and trailing null values.\nCheers! :+1:\n. I've written this comment elsewhere, but here it is again:\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n. Going to move the discussion for click events to #172.\n. Isn't the whole point of a donut chart to show the label inside the hole?\n. OK, feel free to add new stuff, but you need to support the existing behaviour before I'll consider merging it.\n. Oh, and please try to add some tests when you're adding new features.\nI'm disappointed with the existing test coverage in Morris.js, and slamming in new features with no tests isn't helping. :cry: \n. I'm currently working on a complete refactor of the hover code - which will include this feature - so I won't be merging this PR. Please follow my progress on #134.\n. Again, this will be covered by the HTML hover refactor. Follow #134.\n. Fixed and online now. All caused by a single comma! (6ecb432)\n. This PR is next on my list to review. It may require some re-work now that the html hover code is in master (it could be useful to use the new hitTest methods on line and bar charts, for example).\nAnyway, I promise to review this one soon!\n. It's also worth noting that Raphael will generate VML markup for versions of IE that do not have native SVG support, so CSS classes and DOM events aren't going to work for us there.\n. Yeah, it totally sucks. It's the reason why Morris uses Raphael and isn't just another wrapper around D3 :frowning:\n. OK, this is pretty much all done now, except documentation.  Since the docs are going to go on the gh-pages branch (and won't be published until the v0.4.0 release), I'm merging this PR into master now.\n. Please add any changes to the coffeescript source file (in this case, lib/morris.donut.coffee).  I can't accept pull requests that modify the compiled javascript directly. :-1:\nFWIW, this is inconsistent with the existing colors option for donut charts. For consistency, I'd rather the option here was a labelColors array containing a color value for each data row (or similar).\n. See the solution in #139. This will be released in v4.0!\n. Merged! :+1:\nI've removed the prefix and suffix options from the formatter callback -- there's little point in pushing user-supplied data back in the callback arguments when it can be whatever the user wants within the callback itself!\n. OK, this is now merged. I have altered the options as follows:\n- grid (true/false) controls rendering of the grid lines\n- axes (true/false) controls rendering of the axis labels\nAgain, thanks for the PR! :+1:\n. Could you implement this feature for your charts using the new hoverCallback feature instead? It's currently undocumented, but see the example in decimals-custom-hover.\nI'm not sure this is a common enough use case to justify adding the extra complexity to the core library.\n. Honestly, my gut reaction is that just isn't a great chart.\nI want to keep Morris.js simple, so I'm pushing back on more features recently. If you want to do this with Morris.js, I suggest you find an alternative way of showing that data. Otherwise look at Highcharts or something in the D3 ecosystem.\n. I've rejected this #148, so I'm closing this one too.\n. There will not be a placeholder by default in morris.js it's up to you to provide a meaningful message to your users that fits the formatting of your site.\nHowever, if there's an issue where an empty data object breaks the chart with setData, then we should fix that.\n. Love it :+1:\n. I'm going to take a DHH-style stand on this and say I don't particularly care for rounded corners, and I don't think the benefits are worth the maintenance and test overhead of having this in the codebase. Hence I'm rejecting this pull request.\nHowever, I'd be very interested in any pull requests that improve the x-labelling. I'd like to see something that enables angled or vertical labels in order to fit more labels along the x-axis. If I find the time between my Googley responsibilities, I may have a go at this code, but I'd very happy to receive a pull request if you're keen :)\n. There's definitely some readability and testability benefits to encapsulating this drawing code into methods, but (as has been said already), a separate class isn't the place for these. I'd rather see them declared on the class that owns the drawing operations (drawBar on Morris.Bar, etc).\nMake sense?\n. This is merged - thanks for the contribution! :+1:\n. Merged, with a small tweak.\n. Again, I'm going to take a stand and say I don't think this is a valuable enough feature to be worth the maintenance and test overhead of including it in the repo. IMHO if you want to create multiple stacked columns, you need to re-think your visualisation ideas...\n. Two reasons:\n1. Since joining Google I've had a lot less spare time to spend on Morris.js.  Big PRs are more time-consuming to review and merge, especially where there's a number of dependent new features being added.\n2. I don't think moving the label outside of the donut is a good direction to move in. It certainly doesn't fit the use case I have for donuts.\n. My philosophy for Morris.js is for it to be a simple charting library. It's the one you reach for when you want to do something quick and simple, without sacrificing aesthetics.\nFeatures like milti-dimensional donut charts and rich interactivity are beyond that philosophy. I'd very much prefer people to be using more advanced visualisation libraries like D3.\n. Closing this as a dupe of #162.\n. Why have this feature as well as events?\nIMHO, it's feature bloat. Morris.js is all about minimalism and simplicity. Do it right one way, or not at all.\n. I'm not sure this is something that's absolutely necessary for Morris.\n. A few comments:\n- I'd rather see pull requests with a single feature - it makes it easier to merge quickly and focus discussion.\n- I'm not sure I see the point of customising the hover CSS prefix. It's already sufficiently namespaced to not conflict with other libraries, and you can have different CSS in different charts by using parent selectors. It seems like a waste of code to me.\n- I like the idea of changing the gravity of the hover box, but I'm not sold on being able to overflow the container - I'd like to retain the old constrained behaviour and make the overflow optional.\n. OK, I think I'll take a pass on this pull request.\n. That's not really possible at the moment. The best you can currently do is a bar chart with multiple data series alongside each other..\n. Please make changes against the coffee-script, not the javascript files.\nThe javascript is automatically generated from the coffee-script.\n. Yes, there's definitely scope to improve this code. Fudging the line numbers is not the right answer though. The graph bounds need to be calculated more intelligently and so do the numLines.\n. See also #168.\n. I'll add it to my todo list.\nFWIW, I'll be uploading a change with new y-axis labelling this weekend,\nwhich I'd appreciate you all testing!\nOn Thu, Mar 28, 2013 at 5:44 PM, t3chn0r notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nNot sure if there's been any work on this but I was looking for an option\nto only have int numbers on the Y-Axis and couldn't find anything.

It's not exactly the same problem, but we should fix both at the same time.\n. Yeah, I'd strongly suggest not adding any new chart types for v0.5 - there's plenty of new code already that needs to be documented and released.\nAnd for pie charts, well, I've yet to see a beautiful pie chart on the web, and none of the attempts for morris.js so far appear to be any better than the norm. :cry:\nI'd be very happy if anyone had any good ideas for making pie charts attractive though!\n. Even that one seems pretty dull. The pie chart itself is incredibly easy (there's already great examples in g.raphael). The difficult part is getting the labelling or legend to work elegantly, which I don't think ember charts have solved yet, unfortunately.\n. Definitely. I think it'd be great to have a choice of horizontal, diagonal or vertical labels.\n. There's a drawXAxis method (or something similar - I don't have the code in\nfront of me to refer to) in Morris.Line and Morris.Bar that handles the\nactual drawing, which is the majority of the code.\nThere's also some code somewhere that calculates the height of the x-axis\nlabel area (I think this is in Morris.Grid at the moment), which will\nprobably need significant refactoring to deal with rotated labels.\nOlly\nOn 27 Jan 2013, at 14:41, James Seigel notifications@github.com wrote:\nAny idea what that would take or where I'd have to look to poke at that\npart of the code?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/173#issuecomment-12754973.\n.

This isn't something I consider urgent, but I'll always be open to well-written pull requests! :smile:\n. No, and that's not what I envisioned the donut being useful for.

There are pointFillColors and pointStrokeColors that you can use to customize the appearance of points.\nThere's nothing to customize line segments yet though. I'm not sure it'd be an easy job either, I think it'd require separate lines for each segment (rather than one continuous line string as we have now).\nPhilosophically, I'd very much rather morris.js provided a generic solution for customising the line/point appearance, rather than having application-specific presets like first/lastDataPointIncomplete.\n. Morris.js is optimised for row set-type data sets, like database tables.  Completely independent series is something it won't support without a major rewrite. I suggest, for now, you look for another charting library if this feature is crucial for you.\n. Exactly as @sudodoki has said. I can't run this project alone any more. I'm looking for contributors to add to the repo.\nIf you can demonstrate in a pull request that you understand the ethos of the project and can write good, clean code, then please send that pull request and note that you want to become a contributor.\n. I think the xLabels config option would probably help here.\nSee docs: http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/lines.html\n. I'd rather users built their legends using their own data, as supplied to the barColors and labels attributes of the config object on the Morris.Bar constructor.\nI don't see much value in a callback that gives a user back the exact same data that they've already supplied to us.\nDoes that make sense?\n. I think we should concentrate on getting the behavior right for v0.5.\nThat means, imho, we should at least deprecate continuousLine.\nIf possible, I'd like the area chart to also make the area non-contiguous on null values.\n.

Undefined values cannot be spanned in default area charts. Stacking just doesn't work when the values are out of step.\n3.

If you use numeric type arguments, then it'll be interpreted as a timestamp -- in this case, your max time being interpreted as 8.5ms (and unfortunately there's no labelling scheme yet for timespans that small).\nI think the easiest way to get this to act as expected is to translate your values into numeric millisecond timestamps or ISO date strings.\n. Yeah, there's unfortunately no unbinding on the resize handler currently. I'll see what I can do to fix this..\n. What you're describing is a scatter plot, not a line chart. Morris.js doesn't support scatter plots, I'm afraid.\n. Try using setTimeout instead of setInterval. setInterval will continue calling the code every 2 seconds until the tab is closed. setTimeout will only update once.\n. JQuery.getJSON is an asynchronous method, so you need to use the success callback to get the result. For your example, you want to use something like the following code:\njs\n$.getJSON(\"lead_volume\", function (data) {\n  Morris.Line({\n    data: data,\n    element: \"lead_volume\",\n    xkey: \"date\",\n    ykeys: [\"total\"],\n    labels: [\"Total\"],\n  });\n});\n. Yes, that's a somewhat deliberate limitation. If your chart has no data, I would assume your users would prefer to see a friendly message rather than a blank div. Morris does not have a default \"no data\" message to force chart creators to supply a contextually-relevant message of their own.\n. What do you mean by disable? Do you want to disable all interactivity?\n. That's something I would expect your event handlers to deal with. You would just need a 'busy' flag in your event handler to tell it to ignore events if a load is in progress.\nAs an aside, and apologies if I'm second-guessing your motives -- wouldn't it be better for your users to support clicking whilst the DataTable is loading? If they accidentally click on the wrong segment, should they be forced to wait for the load to complete before they can select the correct one?\n. There's no solution built into Morris.js, because I don't want to bind myself to any specific AJAX loading mechanism. I suggest you use CSS classes to add placeholder text or images into your graph element then, once you've loaded your data, remove the placeholder class and initialise the Morris.js chart.\nRough example:\nHTML:\nhtml\n<div id=\"my-chart\" class=\"loading\"></div>\nCSS:\n``` css\nmy-chart.loading {\nbackground-image: url(loader.png);\n  background-position: center;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\nJS:\njs\n$(function () {\n  $.ajax({\n    dataType: \"json\",\n    url: \"/chart/data\",\n    success: function (data) {\n      $(\"#my-chart\").removeClass(\"loading\");\n      Morris.Line({\n        data: data,\n        // xkey, ykeys, etc...\n      });\n    }\n});\n. Sounds good to me. :+1:\n. The plain css file is minified already, so I've removed the .min part of the URL in the docs.\nFixed in 4d59c64\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Nice! LGTM\n. LGTM. Can you double-check the build failure?\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM, thanks :+1:\n. LGTM :+1:\n. It's just that way to differentiate between lines that need to be broken (null. e.g., to indicate a break in a data series) and lines that need to ignore missing values (undefined).\n. Should be fixed by f740d80c140c8f075acb72b9ee26a7e63b37af36 - I've added YYYY-MM parsing.\nBTW, morris.js expects data that's already been sorted newest-first (ie. the opposite order of your example above).\nHope that helps!\n. Heh, no worries! :)\n. GH-pages branch.\n. I've re-written it in coffee-script.  It's a bit prettier.\n. Cool!  I'll merge these later.\n. I've pulled your new examples into the main source tree, and somewhat inspired by your start on the documentation, I've put up a proper site at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js\nAlso note, there's been a couple of small API changes too.  Check the docs! :)\n. Thanks for this (and the Makefile too!).\n. Morris expects your data to be sorted so the most recent point is first in the array. Switching your sort order should fix your problem.\n(and I should probably add a .sort somewhere in the code so the order of points passed in doesn't matter)\n. No worries :)\n(and I've opened #10 to deal with the sorting)\n. Done in fc4ff279a5 - YAY!\n. Done in dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Merged - thanks!\n. I posted an update to the website an hour or so ago - it should be there by now!\n. Can't believe I missed that one - thanks!\n. Thanks.  I've merged and done a little bit of refactoring - see dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Yup, that's the plan. There's also some refactoring to be done in the rendering code to cope with a different date format internally.\n. Fantastic! :)\nI'm planning to move to proper javascript timestamps for the internal time representation, but I think this should be OK to merge in the meantime.  I'll have a proper look later.\nThe axis labelling needs a refactor too -- the site I originally build morris.js for was only concerned with annual data, so there's only labels at year boundaries.  In #9 I'll make the labelling a lot smarter, so it should be able to work out the correct labelling intervals automatically.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5!\n. Should be fixed now in master.  A nuance in the implementation got missed when I translated to coffeescript.  Schoolboy error on my part!\n. Try sorting your data in order of newest first.  This should fix your problem.\nAlternatively, wait for me to close issue #10!\n. I'm currently working on doing that -- please see issue #9.\n. I'm not seeing that same behaviour here.\nCould you post some example code, and let me know which browser you're using?\n. here is some example code, which works fine in all the browsers I can get my hands on (even IE6).\nClosing this issue.\n. That's not something that I'm currently working on, but I think it's something that I'll definitely get around to doing.\nWatch this space!\n. This has just been done in 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e.\nI'll include it in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. Yes, you can supply dates in YYYY-MM format and they'll render OK.\nHowever, the x-axis labelling code needs work to properly display dates to month accuracy along the axis. At the moment it'll only label year boundaries (this should be rectified when issue #9 is finished).\n. Excellent stuff, thanks!\n. At the moment, that's not possible -- and not currently on the roadmap either.\nSorry!\n. All merged - thanks!\n. Are you using integers or strings in your x-values?\nMorris.js will attempt to sort the incoming x-values, so it may be getting the sort order messed up if they're strings.\n. I'm not sure what you're trying to do.  Can you post some example code?\n. Try replacing\ndata: [$graph],\nwith\ndata: $graph,\nAlso ensure that jQuery's properly parsing the JSON data.  If you're using Chrome or Safari, doing a console.log($graph); should dump the contents of $graph to the console, and it'll show you if it's a string (bad) or an object (good!).\n. Great - glad it's working for you now!\n. Great idea - I'll stick it on my TODO list!\n. I'm working on a refactor of the hover labels at the moment.\nFollow my work on #134.\n. For negative values, keep your eye on issue #25 - they're on my TODO list.\nFor week numbers, make sure you're using at least v0.2.3, then try either formatting them as ISO standard week numbers (ie. 2012 W11), or set the parseTime option to false to skip date parsing and treat your X values as an arbitrary stream.\n. Support for negative numbers has just been added in commit 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e\nIt'll get included in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. This is done in bcc034e152534aa8c6f8e5267c77a786ebcb127e (see the units option)\nIt'll go into v0.2.4 too\n. None of those are currently on my roadmap.\nMy philosophy is to keep morris.js as simple as possible to use, so some of those features might not ever make it into the library.  You might be better served by some of the more fully-featured (and complex) graphing libraries.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5.  Checkout the updated docs at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js/ and the example code in examples/timestamp.html.\nCheers!\n. Yeah, decimal values aren't very well supported at the moment. They're\nin my plan...\nSent from my iPad\nOn 9 Mar 2012, at 20:33, Pavel Shvedov\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nNow Morris drows a chart like http://cl.ly/0s0p0u283Z2f3j0J0A3Z for the code like\nMorris.Line({\n           element: 'u_price_quotes',\n           data: [\n{date: '2010-11-02', value: 10.83},\n               {date: '2010-11-03', value: 10.45},\n               {date: '2010-11-04', value: 10.60},\n               {date: '2010-11-05', value: 10.70}\n       ],\n       xkey: 'date',\n       ykeys: ['value'],\n       labels: ['Series A']\n   });\nSo, the value is rounded when is displayed in the label. Is there any option to disable the rounding?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/37\n. I've just committed a fix for this in 634179d.  Decimal values will no longer be rounded.\n\nIt'll get included in the next release.\n. Thanks!\nI've got a rough idea for doing something similar (one of the graphs on howmanyleft could really do with support for partial series).  I'll keep this implementation in mind when I'm hacking :)\n. Been through this today - your code was great.  Apart from a small tweak, I've merged it straight in.\nThanks!\n. At the moment, decimal values will be represented in the line, but the labels are rounded.  See Issue #37.\n. Yeah, the current labelling code is nowhere near good enough to handle anything but annual data.\nI'm refactoring the labelling code now to be smarter about this -- to determine a labelling strategy based on the range of the x-axis (so it'll increment the labels in centuries / decades / years / months / days / hours / minutes / seconds / etc depending on what the total range is).  At the same time I'm refactoring the code to accept full javascript timestamps as x-values.\nYour approach so far is pretty radically different to the one I'm planning, so I'm not going to merge this code as it stands.  I'm pretty busy at the moment though, so my code's going to take a while to complete. You might be best-off working with your fork for now until mine's ready for release.\nHope that helps!\n. Yup, I'll keep in mind relative timestamps.  They won't be in the first drop, but I'll make sure they're on the roadmap (which reminds me, I really should keep a roadmap in these issues!) :)\n. xlabelMargin as an option: great.\nYour xlabels, however, aren't ready to be merged.  A complete solution to the labelling challenge needs two further problems solved:\n- Automatically choosing the correct label steps --  If the label margin is 20 px, the width of the x axis is 200 px and the timespan is 10 years, the labels should be years.  If the timespan is a week, then they should be days.\n- The label formatting should make it obvious what the label means.  If it's months, then labelling \"2012-01\" or \"Jan\" gives the right context to understand the label. \"01\" does not.\nThanks for the contribution.  I hope we can solve these problems and get some awesome xlabel formatting!\n. Great stuff, but this isn't quite ready to merge yet.\n- Camel-case formatting on the options, please -- that means they should be drawXLabels and drawYLabels.  Also check your code, there's a mix of drawYlabel and drawYlabels, so Y-axis labelling is broken in this commit.\n- When the labelling is disabled, can you set the bounds of the drawing area to fill the element (rather than having empty space where the labels would have been).\n. This only reads the year, month, day, hour and minute parts of the time spec.  Would it not be easier to just add an optional 'T' to the middle of the regexp for YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM type?\n. I've just pushed a fix in 18b4191 - let me know if it works for you!\n. Thanks for the bug report!\nI've just committed a fix in b3ab944 - hopefully everything should be working for you now.\n. Looks great -- it's a good intermediate step towards getting properly 'magic' date/time labelling on the x-axis.\nI'll give it a whirl this evening and if it all works well, I'll merge it :)\n. Yeah, I've been considering using moment.js -- but if possible I'd like to get a solution that doesn't need another external dependency.\n. This code wasn't quite in line with the direction I've taken with my own code, so I've skipped merging it.\nHowever, my automatic x-labelling code is now merged into master -- see commit fc4ff279a5.  Let me know if it works for you guys!\n. I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to do -- I think the best way to explain this to me is in code, so do please go ahead and submit a pull request! :)\n. Sorry, that's not something that I've any real need for at the moment.\nIf you'd like, feel free to contribute some code and I'll consider including it!\nAlternatively, g.raphael can make use of the same dependencies as Morris.js and draw pies too.\nThanks,\nOlly\n. I'm totally an advocate of using Highcharts for complicated stuff too, but area charts shouldn't be complicated to add to morris.js -- I'll add them to my TODO list! :)\n. Ok, you guys win - area charts are the next thing I'll be adding to Morris. Watch this space :+1:\n. OK, area charts are now in master.\nThis example shows you how it works.\n\n. Any reason why you can't use YYYY-MM-DD HH:00 ? ;)\n. I've merged this, with one small change.  Local time is used when neither zulu time nor an offset are specified.\nThanks for your contribution!\n. This is in now -- I've made a couple of small tweaks that will affect you when you pull in the latest master branch.  Make sure you take a look at the last couple of commits.\nThanks loads for the contribution!\n. It's in!  I've made a small change to use camel-case (so the options become preUnits and postUnits), and a small refactor - see fa8f8c6.\nThanks again!\n. Currently, I think Morris.js only properly handles continuous series -- ie. there can be null values at the beginning and end of a series, but not in the middle.\nThe difficulty here is in deciding what the behaviour should be for null values -- I presume you need the line plot to be continuous (rather than have gaps where the null values are)?\n. This should be A-OK now.  Let me know if it's working for you.\n. Can you send me an example/jsfiddle showing this?\n. I can't reproduce this at all.  Changing CSS widths on the containing element in all my examples changes the corresponding width of the graph. Closing this issue.\n. Yeah, the current implementation uses a single tooltip which it moves around and rewrites the labels when you hover different points.  Refactoring that won't be straightforward...\nBest of luck -- don't forget to send a pull request when you get it working!\n. This is in, although I've removed the deep copy in favour of a shallow one (the only destructive change to the data array is sorting, so a deep copy was overkill).\nSee 942e121\n. Hi!\nThanks for the pull request....\n... however, there's no code changes needed to support more than 7 lines.  The default config for line colours in morris.js only contains 7 colours, so all you need to do is pass your own lineColors config parameter with the number of lines that you need.\nSee here: http://jsfiddle.net/MKhdW/\nHope that helps!\n. Merged at last - thanks!\n. Thanks guys - have fixed in aa67b1a and released 0.2.9.\n. Fixed in aa67b1a. Thanks!\n. Like some other pull requests I've cleared out today, I'm not convinced this one's worth the test/maintenance overhead.\nClosing.\n. This should be fixed now in master, and it'll be released in v0.2.10.\n. I've had a hack at this today, and I've added a setData() method to Morris.Line.  Take a look at the 'updating' example to see how it works.\nCurrently this is just on the master branch, but I'll include it in the next release (v0.2.10).  Let me know if it solves your problem.\n. Right now there's no code to support resizing the graph, so I'd expect 'odd' behaviour when resizing.\nCan you send me a jsfiddle that reproduces the container width and height problems you're experiencing?\n. Thanks! I've merged and released this in 0.2.10.\n. This is fixed on master now.\nI also recommend using an auto N value in the ymax and/or ymin options, so you can set the range that the graph will show when there's absolutely no variance in the data values.\n. Those kinds of requirements are way ahead of Morris.js right now. I suggest you take a look at D3.js, which would do a far better job of satisfying them.\nOlly\n. xLabelFormat is the option you're looking for (see the docs for more info).  dateFormat doesn't affect the x-axis labels because of the automatic 'smart' labelling it uses to work out the most suitable labels for the x-axis date range.\n(so bear in mind if you change xLabelFormat to always display DD. MM. YYYY., it won't look so great when the date range isn't suitable for labels of that granularity)\nHTH\nOlly\n. You may need to delay rendering until the containing element is visible on-screen.

This should be fixed in v0.3.0 (available to download now).\n. You're nearly there with removing the quotes from value -- Morris.js requires numerical values in that field.\n\nTry using a helper (or maybe a decorator?) to map #to_i against the values.\n. Something like the following, perhaps?\n``` ruby\nin application_helper.rb\ndef donut_json\n  @result_donut.map { |x| {:label => x[:label], :value => x[:value].to_i} }.to_json.to_s.html_safe\nend\n```\n.. and then, in your view\nhtml\n<script>\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: <%= donut_json %>\n});\n</script>\nDisclaimer: this is quick and dirty code, so you may want to tidy/reorganise it as you see fit.\n. I've just pushed a solution to master.  You can now pass a function to Morris.Donut to format the value however you need to.  Grab the latest morris.min.js and give this a go:\njavascript\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: /* your data here */\n  formatter: function (x) { return Math.floor(x / 60) + ':' + Morris.pad2(x % 60) }\n});\nDisclaimer: again, a quick+dirty solution - feel free to customize the formatter to fit your needs :)\n. You can use xLabelFormat to add a custom formatter for date labels.\n. The graphs won't draw properly if their container has 'display: none'.  I've worked around this in my bootstrap sites by listening for the 'shown' event on the tab and only initialising charts in the event handler.\nHTH!\nOlly\n. Try adding lineColors to your config with enough colors for all of your series (I think the default config only supports a maximum of 8ish series before it runs out of colors).\n.

Grab the latest master, then calling select(n) on the object that Morris.Donut(...) returns.\nI've just added some code that should do what you need.\n. Whoops - my fault for coding too late at night! :)\nTry again now - should be fixed.\n. Try the latest master, I've slightly modified the ymin/ymax behaviour.  FWIW, I recommend setting ymax to auto N in these situations (where N is a sensible number for your dataset).\n.

I'm gradually working towards getting more charts in - if you've got some specific ideas for what you'd like to see, I'd be glad to see some mockups or similar designs (or even better, some code!).\nI'd avoided including legends in the donut chart because the legend can quickly overwhelm the chart. The donut chart should be a very simple overview of the data, and if you need more information alongside it, I'd recommend adding a table or a different kind of visualisation so that its easily readable and accessible.\n. Thanks to the enthusiasm in the other thread, area charts are next on my list of priorities. Once they're out of the way I'll start investigating bars! :+1:\n. OK, basic support for bars are in now too! See #101 for details.\n. Radars are a pain in the ass (and I'm not convinced they work well on the web), so I'd rather keep them out of morris completely.\nGauges are more interesting. They're pretty simple, so should be a quick-ish job to complete. I'll add a separate issue to discuss them.\nClosing this issue now, since it's dragged on for a looooooooooooong while.\n. Nice one - thanks!\n. Good spot!  I guess I was just lucky that all my graphs with parseTime: false so far have had ordered x-keys :)\n. What are you sending to Morris in the element option?\n. Is there a <div id='stocks_chart' ... > on your page?\n. Are you running the javascript that calls Morris.Line on pages that don't contain #stocks_chart?\nMaybe move the call to Morris.Line inside an if statement that checks for the presence of #stocks_chart on the page?\n. If you're using rails assets, then it's likely that script will be on every page, yes.  I'd recommend keeping it in your assets folder, but use an if statement to stop it from executing on the wrong pages.\nSomething like this:\ncoffee-script\njQuery ->\n  if $('#stocks_chart').length\n    Morris.Line\n      element: 'stocks_chart'\n      data: $('#stocks_chart').data('stocks')\n      # ...\n. Are your YYYY time stamps strings or numbers?\nMorris will parse strings as years, and numbers as numeric time stamps.\nCan you give me an example (using jsbin or similar) of where the code doesn't work?\n. I'm not quite sure I understand the problem. Can you replicate it with some code on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net and reply with the link?\n. I've changed that first jsbin slightly to insert some dummy data rather than call the PHP code, and it appears to be working fine (I see x-axis labels)\nhttp://jsbin.com/igasid/10/edit\nDoes that work for you?\n. Try using xLabels: \"hour\" - if you force it to use day labels and the data doesn't span any boundaries between days, then you'll get no labels on the x axis.\n. Hmm.. not sure why that's happening.\nCan you paste in here the output of console.log(colors)?\n.

A side-comment regarding zero values:\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n.

Yes, in the current version of Morris.js, you'll need to convert those d values to millisecond timestamps for dateFormat to take effect.\n(See also #90, which is for adding support for formatting string values in x labels)\n. Sorry, I meant the d values in your data should be timestamps in order for dateFormat to work.\nAnyway, I've commited a fix for #90 this morning that should help here.  If you grab the latest version from master, then the following code should work (note the value that is passed to the dateFormat callback is a timestamp, not a Date).\nMorris.Line({\n  element: 'chart',\n  data: [\n    {d: '2012-10-18', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-17', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-15', w: 1, n: 0, t: 1 },\n  ],\n  xkey: 'd',\n  ykeys: ['w', 'n', 't'],\n  xLabelFormat: function(d) {\n    return d.getDate()+'/'+(d.getMonth()+1)+'/'+d.getFullYear(); \n  },\n  xLabels:'day',\n  labels: ['Winners', 'Non-winners', 'Total'],\n  lineColors: ['#167f39','#990000', '#000099'],\n  lineWidth: 2,\n  dateFormat: function (ts) {\n    var d = new Date(ts);\n    return d.getYear() + '/' + (d.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + d.getDay();\n  }\n});\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. The ts value is just a parameter on the dateFormat function (the name doesn't matter, you could call it purple_elephants if you wanted).\nIf you grab the latest Morris.js code from the github repository, you won't need any more timestamp data.\n. Can you try with the latest master version? I've done some refactoring recently which should have fixed this issue.\n. The hover is designed to replace a fixed legend. I really don't see the value in having a partial hover and adding a legend -- it's putting redundant data on the screen.\nDo you see what I mean?\n. As I see it, the hover is showing necessary information (the series colors), even when it isn't showing values for some series.  There is an argument for making the hover less noisy and/or easier to scan when there are missing values though.\nIf you're keen to show a legend alongside the chart, then you can access the colors array from the .options.lineColors property on the object that Morris.Line returns.\n``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line(/ ... /);\nconsole.log(chart.options.lineColors); // ['#0b62a4', '#7A92A3', ...]\n``\n. I've already switched \"n/a\" for \"-\" in the hover, but I'm still not happy that it's the _right_ solution. I think it could do with some table-alignment of the series labels and values to make it a little prettier.... :confused:\n. If you resize the element that contains the graph and callredraw()on the object returned byMorris.Line`, the graph should be redrawn to fit.\nSee the documentation for window.onresize() to see how you hook into resize events in javascript.\nNote: I suggest you call redraw() sparingly as it's quite an expensive operation. Try using a setTimeout trick or similar to avoid calling it for intermediate resize events.\n. That's great, thanks!\nI'm working on area charts (and beefing up the test suite) at the moment, which is why there's been so much refactoring recently.  I'll try to get this integrated as soon as the area charts are done.\n:+1:\n. It's not possible right now, but I'm currently working on it.  See #47.\n. Right now that's not possible, but it's a sensible feature to add.\nI'll leave this issue open as a reminder.  Thanks!\n. Closed with #103\n. Cool!\nI'm going to hack on this now. I'm thinking of changing the way the x-axis scaling works for bar graphs. Instead of doing a straight time-based interpolation, I'd rather split the chart into equal-sized blocks for each entry in options.data. This should mean we don't need the padding calculations..\n. OK, take a look at e4f4594.  I've taken your work and pared it right down to the absolute bare essentials, removing some unnecessary bits that were leftover from Morris.Line and refactoring anything relating to horizontal positioning.\nTo keep the basic functionality of the bar chart clear, I've removed some of your new additions. I've no objections to any of them, I'd just like to build up the features incrementally from a really solid base.\nWhat do you think?\n\n. Looking forward to your next pull request already - thanks for all the hard\nwork! :)\nSent from my iPad\nOn 31 Oct 2012, at 22:15, Marcin Chwedziak notifications@github.com wrote:\nSweet!\nAnyway, I will still need to fork Morris.Bar because I do need gradient\nsupport for fill attribute.

Honestly, I'm not convinced this is a really necessary core addition to the library. Everybody wants their own combination of weird and wonderful coloring for their bar charts, and this only covers one aspect. My preference would be to make it completely flexible, and make options.barColors able to accept a function that generates the correct colors.\nSomething like:\njavascript\nbarColors: function (data, type) {\n  // data: series name/index, x / y values\n  // type: 'hover' or 'bar'\n  if (type === 'hover') {\n    // generate a hover color\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (type === 'bar') {\n    // generate a bar fill color\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n. I've added the callback code now -- take a look at 236afa4.\n. Looks good to me :+1:\nA couple of notes:\n- Math.min / Math.max will treat a null as a zero, so you need to be careful of passing nulls\n- I'm trying to move away from using $.map towards using coffee-script list comprehensions wherever possible (they look tidier to me :grinning:)\n(see 8faced7 for the changes I made when merging)\n. There's a lot of overlap in functionality between this and Morris.Donut.  I'd like to investigate moving some of the common code into a base class.\nI'll have a hack at this and see what I can come up with.\n. Closed by #106\n.

Finally getting around to looking at this. Looking pretty damned good so far!\nHowever, I'm not sure there's any justification for the multiple inheritance (or composition) code here - the hover methods could be declared directly on Morris.Grid, couldn't they?\n. I'm carrying on this work in the html-hover branch. See #134.\nClosing this PR now.\n. LGTM! :+1:\n. First check the element is present on the page before attempting to draw it.  \nif ($(\"#element-id\").length > 0) { .... } will help.\n. ... and the other chart?\n. This has been fixed in master. Closing.\n. Yup, this is definitely out of scope for morris.js.\n. I've done some refactoring, beefed up the tests a little and merged broken-lines into master.\nSee d41bea2 for my changes. It's nothing huge - just a little tidying in the tests, and a refactor to createPath & gradients to handle leading and trailing null values.\nCheers! :+1:\n. I've written this comment elsewhere, but here it is again:\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n. Going to move the discussion for click events to #172.\n. Isn't the whole point of a donut chart to show the label inside the hole?\n. OK, feel free to add new stuff, but you need to support the existing behaviour before I'll consider merging it.\n. Oh, and please try to add some tests when you're adding new features.\nI'm disappointed with the existing test coverage in Morris.js, and slamming in new features with no tests isn't helping. :cry: \n. I'm currently working on a complete refactor of the hover code - which will include this feature - so I won't be merging this PR. Please follow my progress on #134.\n. Again, this will be covered by the HTML hover refactor. Follow #134.\n. Fixed and online now. All caused by a single comma! (6ecb432)\n. This PR is next on my list to review. It may require some re-work now that the html hover code is in master (it could be useful to use the new hitTest methods on line and bar charts, for example).\nAnyway, I promise to review this one soon!\n. It's also worth noting that Raphael will generate VML markup for versions of IE that do not have native SVG support, so CSS classes and DOM events aren't going to work for us there.\n. Yeah, it totally sucks. It's the reason why Morris uses Raphael and isn't just another wrapper around D3 :frowning:\n. OK, this is pretty much all done now, except documentation.  Since the docs are going to go on the gh-pages branch (and won't be published until the v0.4.0 release), I'm merging this PR into master now.\n. Please add any changes to the coffeescript source file (in this case, lib/morris.donut.coffee).  I can't accept pull requests that modify the compiled javascript directly. :-1:\nFWIW, this is inconsistent with the existing colors option for donut charts. For consistency, I'd rather the option here was a labelColors array containing a color value for each data row (or similar).\n. See the solution in #139. This will be released in v4.0!\n. Merged! :+1:\nI've removed the prefix and suffix options from the formatter callback -- there's little point in pushing user-supplied data back in the callback arguments when it can be whatever the user wants within the callback itself!\n. OK, this is now merged. I have altered the options as follows:\n- grid (true/false) controls rendering of the grid lines\n- axes (true/false) controls rendering of the axis labels\nAgain, thanks for the PR! :+1:\n. Could you implement this feature for your charts using the new hoverCallback feature instead? It's currently undocumented, but see the example in decimals-custom-hover.\nI'm not sure this is a common enough use case to justify adding the extra complexity to the core library.\n. Honestly, my gut reaction is that just isn't a great chart.\nI want to keep Morris.js simple, so I'm pushing back on more features recently. If you want to do this with Morris.js, I suggest you find an alternative way of showing that data. Otherwise look at Highcharts or something in the D3 ecosystem.\n. I've rejected this #148, so I'm closing this one too.\n. There will not be a placeholder by default in morris.js it's up to you to provide a meaningful message to your users that fits the formatting of your site.\nHowever, if there's an issue where an empty data object breaks the chart with setData, then we should fix that.\n. Love it :+1:\n. I'm going to take a DHH-style stand on this and say I don't particularly care for rounded corners, and I don't think the benefits are worth the maintenance and test overhead of having this in the codebase. Hence I'm rejecting this pull request.\nHowever, I'd be very interested in any pull requests that improve the x-labelling. I'd like to see something that enables angled or vertical labels in order to fit more labels along the x-axis. If I find the time between my Googley responsibilities, I may have a go at this code, but I'd very happy to receive a pull request if you're keen :)\n. There's definitely some readability and testability benefits to encapsulating this drawing code into methods, but (as has been said already), a separate class isn't the place for these. I'd rather see them declared on the class that owns the drawing operations (drawBar on Morris.Bar, etc).\nMake sense?\n. This is merged - thanks for the contribution! :+1:\n. Merged, with a small tweak.\n. Again, I'm going to take a stand and say I don't think this is a valuable enough feature to be worth the maintenance and test overhead of including it in the repo. IMHO if you want to create multiple stacked columns, you need to re-think your visualisation ideas...\n. Two reasons:\n1. Since joining Google I've had a lot less spare time to spend on Morris.js.  Big PRs are more time-consuming to review and merge, especially where there's a number of dependent new features being added.\n2. I don't think moving the label outside of the donut is a good direction to move in. It certainly doesn't fit the use case I have for donuts.\n. My philosophy for Morris.js is for it to be a simple charting library. It's the one you reach for when you want to do something quick and simple, without sacrificing aesthetics.\nFeatures like milti-dimensional donut charts and rich interactivity are beyond that philosophy. I'd very much prefer people to be using more advanced visualisation libraries like D3.\n. Closing this as a dupe of #162.\n. Why have this feature as well as events?\nIMHO, it's feature bloat. Morris.js is all about minimalism and simplicity. Do it right one way, or not at all.\n. I'm not sure this is something that's absolutely necessary for Morris.\n. A few comments:\n- I'd rather see pull requests with a single feature - it makes it easier to merge quickly and focus discussion.\n- I'm not sure I see the point of customising the hover CSS prefix. It's already sufficiently namespaced to not conflict with other libraries, and you can have different CSS in different charts by using parent selectors. It seems like a waste of code to me.\n- I like the idea of changing the gravity of the hover box, but I'm not sold on being able to overflow the container - I'd like to retain the old constrained behaviour and make the overflow optional.\n. OK, I think I'll take a pass on this pull request.\n. That's not really possible at the moment. The best you can currently do is a bar chart with multiple data series alongside each other..\n. Please make changes against the coffee-script, not the javascript files.\nThe javascript is automatically generated from the coffee-script.\n. Yes, there's definitely scope to improve this code. Fudging the line numbers is not the right answer though. The graph bounds need to be calculated more intelligently and so do the numLines.\n. See also #168.\n. I'll add it to my todo list.\nFWIW, I'll be uploading a change with new y-axis labelling this weekend,\nwhich I'd appreciate you all testing!\nOn Thu, Mar 28, 2013 at 5:44 PM, t3chn0r notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nNot sure if there's been any work on this but I was looking for an option\nto only have int numbers on the Y-Axis and couldn't find anything.

Try debugging the values you're passing to morris.js. I suspect they'll be strings and you'll need to parseInt(x, 10) them, or something similar.\n. There's definitely scope to improve the Y-axis labelling code. Right now it's very naive, and I think I can do better.\nWatch this space.\n. Closing this as a dupe of #162. It's not exactly the same problem, but we should fix both at the same time.\n. Yeah, I'd strongly suggest not adding any new chart types for v0.5 - there's plenty of new code already that needs to be documented and released.\nAnd for pie charts, well, I've yet to see a beautiful pie chart on the web, and none of the attempts for morris.js so far appear to be any better than the norm. :cry:\nI'd be very happy if anyone had any good ideas for making pie charts attractive though!\n. Even that one seems pretty dull. The pie chart itself is incredibly easy (there's already great examples in g.raphael). The difficult part is getting the labelling or legend to work elegantly, which I don't think ember charts have solved yet, unfortunately.\n. Definitely. I think it'd be great to have a choice of horizontal, diagonal or vertical labels.\n. There's a drawXAxis method (or something similar - I don't have the code in\nfront of me to refer to) in Morris.Line and Morris.Bar that handles the\nactual drawing, which is the majority of the code.\nThere's also some code somewhere that calculates the height of the x-axis\nlabel area (I think this is in Morris.Grid at the moment), which will\nprobably need significant refactoring to deal with rotated labels.\nOlly\nOn 27 Jan 2013, at 14:41, James Seigel notifications@github.com wrote:\nAny idea what that would take or where I'd have to look to poke at that\npart of the code?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/173#issuecomment-12754973.\n.

This isn't something I consider urgent, but I'll always be open to well-written pull requests! :smile:\n. No, and that's not what I envisioned the donut being useful for. I'd suggest using a table as a legend, and assigning colors to your donut segments to match the table.\nTrying to hover labels over donut segments is a huge waste of screen space..\n.

I'm afraid it's just not possible right now to render a morris.js chart without it being on-screen. Being off-screen screws with the drawing APIs.

There are pointFillColors and pointStrokeColors that you can use to customize the appearance of points.\nThere's nothing to customize line segments yet though. I'm not sure it'd be an easy job either, I think it'd require separate lines for each segment (rather than one continuous line string as we have now).\nPhilosophically, I'd very much rather morris.js provided a generic solution for customising the line/point appearance, rather than having application-specific presets like first/lastDataPointIncomplete.\n. Morris.js is optimised for row set-type data sets, like database tables.  Completely independent series is something it won't support without a major rewrite. I suggest, for now, you look for another charting library if this feature is crucial for you.\n. Exactly as @sudodoki has said. I can't run this project alone any more. I'm looking for contributors to add to the repo.\nIf you can demonstrate in a pull request that you understand the ethos of the project and can write good, clean code, then please send that pull request and note that you want to become a contributor.\n. I think the xLabels config option would probably help here.\nSee docs: http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/lines.html\n. I'd rather users built their legends using their own data, as supplied to the barColors and labels attributes of the config object on the Morris.Bar constructor.\nI don't see much value in a callback that gives a user back the exact same data that they've already supplied to us.\nDoes that make sense?\n. I think we should concentrate on getting the behavior right for v0.5.\nThat means, imho, we should at least deprecate continuousLine.\nIf possible, I'd like the area chart to also make the area non-contiguous on null values.\n.

If you use numeric type arguments, then it'll be interpreted as a timestamp -- in this case, your max time being interpreted as 8.5ms (and unfortunately there's no labelling scheme yet for timespans that small).\nI think the easiest way to get this to act as expected is to translate your values into numeric millisecond timestamps or ISO date strings.\n. Yeah, there's unfortunately no unbinding on the resize handler currently. I'll see what I can do to fix this..\n. What you're describing is a scatter plot, not a line chart. Morris.js doesn't support scatter plots, I'm afraid.\n. Try using setTimeout instead of setInterval. setInterval will continue calling the code every 2 seconds until the tab is closed. setTimeout will only update once.\n. JQuery.getJSON is an asynchronous method, so you need to use the success callback to get the result. For your example, you want to use something like the following code:\njs\n$.getJSON(\"lead_volume\", function (data) {\n  Morris.Line({\n    data: data,\n    element: \"lead_volume\",\n    xkey: \"date\",\n    ykeys: [\"total\"],\n    labels: [\"Total\"],\n  });\n});\n. Yes, that's a somewhat deliberate limitation. If your chart has no data, I would assume your users would prefer to see a friendly message rather than a blank div. Morris does not have a default \"no data\" message to force chart creators to supply a contextually-relevant message of their own.\n. What do you mean by disable? Do you want to disable all interactivity?\n. That's something I would expect your event handlers to deal with. You would just need a 'busy' flag in your event handler to tell it to ignore events if a load is in progress.\nAs an aside, and apologies if I'm second-guessing your motives -- wouldn't it be better for your users to support clicking whilst the DataTable is loading? If they accidentally click on the wrong segment, should they be forced to wait for the load to complete before they can select the correct one?\n. There's no solution built into Morris.js, because I don't want to bind myself to any specific AJAX loading mechanism. I suggest you use CSS classes to add placeholder text or images into your graph element then, once you've loaded your data, remove the placeholder class and initialise the Morris.js chart.\nRough example:\nHTML:\nhtml\n<div id=\"my-chart\" class=\"loading\"></div>\nCSS:\n``` css\nmy-chart.loading {\nbackground-image: url(loader.png);\n  background-position: center;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\nJS:\njs\n$(function () {\n  $.ajax({\n    dataType: \"json\",\n    url: \"/chart/data\",\n    success: function (data) {\n      $(\"#my-chart\").removeClass(\"loading\");\n      Morris.Line({\n        data: data,\n        // xkey, ykeys, etc...\n      });\n    }\n});\n. Sounds good to me. :+1:\n. The plain css file is minified already, so I've removed the .min part of the URL in the docs.\nFixed in 4d59c64\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Nice! LGTM\n. LGTM. Can you double-check the build failure?\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM, thanks :+1:\n. LGTM :+1:\n. It's just that way to differentiate between lines that need to be broken (null. e.g., to indicate a break in a data series) and lines that need to ignore missing values (undefined).\n. ",

You should probably take a look at the transY function in grid.coffee, which takes a value and translates it to an Y position. It currently uses linear scaling, but could probably easily be altered to support logarithmic scaling as well.\n. Bootstrap modals expose an event called shown.bs.modal and you should probably use that to redraw the graph.\n. There is no destroy method. I have run into that problem myself as well.

It was needed to actually have the hover over the correct bar (see demo). What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning? I already thought it was a bit weird.\n. I figured out the reason. It was to make sure the hover didn't block the points in a line graph. I added an extra option to the function to make it centre on y and now all the tests pass.\n. Also, I've just emailed @oesmith to ask for official contributor status. Since I think I know the internals of the lib well enough now to be an asset.\n. Fixed that with #457\n.

First of all the fixes in #460 and #474 should be merged since they fix some bugs and after that some documentation should be written for the new features.\nUntil then you can build it yourself, although I suggest you merge #460 since line charts will be broken otherwise.

Hmmm,\n\n\nThat is indeed a weird bug, I'll try to look into it when I have time.\n. Oh, I see it causes some tests to fail. Will check that later.\n. Updated this to not cause an error when null is supplied.\n. This means mostly that you have to much data to show in the graph. Some code to handle the exception would be nice, but physically you're unable to display the data in the graph on the screen real estate you have. \n. First of all, could you remove the compiled js files from your commit? We'll update those in a separate commit. \nAnd I think your second test is broken since it doesn't specify the freePosition option. I also saw some problems with the code that did that. Could you make an example in jsbin that shows what these features are supposed to do? You can reuse this one, just copy your compiled/minified js in there and change the example code.\n. You have removed the compiled files and committed that, which is not what I meant :wink:. That is also why the jsbin doesn't work anymore since the compiled file is not in your git repo. \nCould you make sure that the js files are not changed by your commit?\n. Good call on the tests. Looking forward to that pull request. I see that you changed one of the tests already in this commit. I think it would be better if that was moved to your next one instead of being hidden in this one. \nYou can use git add -p to only add certain lines and not whole files.\n. Oh and the functionality looks good btw. I'll try to merge it when I have time.\n. Could you still do this?\n. I have reported it through the link. They will probably unblock it.\n. Fixed\n. It is indeed because of how the bezier curves work. I don't know enough of the SVG code to know how to make sure this doesn't happen. and smooth: 'false' should indeed remove the problem.\n. I'm using these for dutch values, I haven't taken the effort to make it general an add it to morris itself.\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    dateFormat: function(x) {\n        return new Date(x).toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    xLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    yLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLoceleString('nl-NL');\n    },\n};\n. added yLabelFormat as well.\n. Could you show the issue in a jsbin and could you change the coffeescript file instead of the javascript?\n. Closing this one since there was no response.\n. There is no way to force displaying all the labels. You can rotate them however using yLabelAngle\n. No it's just undocumented as far as I know.\n.

If not, could you make separate pull requests for the different things? Also, could you explain what it does, I haven't used donut charts yet.\n. If you use the js file that is currently on the master branch, you can set the pointSize to zero and the points won't grow.\n. First of all, looking good. I like lean projects as well. However, jQuery also has quite a bit of advantages. First of all, browser compatibility. I like it that stuff just works for different platforms.\n\nSecondly, jQuery can also remove bloat from a project. Most people already include it, especially if they use other javascript heavy libs, like this one. As you can see your commits actually added lines to the codebase, because stuff in jQuery needs to be emulated. This can be solved (like some other libs do) by building a version of the library that needs jquery and one that is stand alone. This is something that would have to be added for me to agree to these commits. \nI would love to know what de other developers think of this.\n. This is not possible at the moment. It does seem useful however, so it could be that it will be added in the future.\n. Oh, stupid mistake. I added that for testing myself. And I'll look into the callback, think I've missed that one \n. I changed it to a callback named barClass to have the same type of interface as the barColors callback.\n. Is the code called after document ready? Or did you make a typo in the container element string?\n. I'm quite sure I fixed this with one of my commits relating to horizontal barcharts. Could you check with the latest compiled js file to see if the problem persists? (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morrisjs/morris.js/master/morris.js)\n. Ah, I see what you mean. You can use the padding option in that case. By default it's 25. It seems undocumented.\n. If you want you can make a pull request against the gh-pages branch to document it.\n. Hmm, I have no clue why this is happening.\n. Yes, it is because of the something in the code on git. Changing the demo to the latest code on github causes the same in that example. The latest release code doesn't have the problem. So you should try using that one.\n. No, you should use the one in the zip on the main site: https://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/\nThe one on github is an \"unofficial\" build, because a couple of people wanted horizontal bar charts.\n. Could you make a jsbin where you reproduce the error? It's impossible to know what's wrong otherwise.\n. I have the same problem myself, but haven't figured out why it is slow with a lot of data. \n. It is not yet in the compiled js, only in the coffee code. You can build a js file yourself though by cloning the repository and following these instructions: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#developer-quick-start\n. Combining angled labels with setting lower xLabelMargin should probably work.\n. I was hoping to help @luben123. For you I would suggest moddifiying your xLabelFormat to output nothing for the months you don't want to show. \nA less hacky option would be making a pull request where you add a quarter option here:\nhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/1c66cfc4ac7b23d324f131bec7739265887e30fc/lib/morris.line.coffee#L431\n. Yes, something like that.\nI think you might need modulo for initialising the start so it will actually be the same months for every plot. Also, I'm quite sure the +3 in the format should be a +1, since I think it is for getting the actual month number instead of a 0 for January.\nCould you change that and test it yourself a bit. If it works I could add it to to the coffee, but you could also make a pull request yourself.\n. It's good that you multiplied it by 3, it is used by the auto chooser. What\nI meant with the modulo was this:\nstart: function(d) {\n    return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth() - (d.getMonth()%3), 1);\n  },\nOn 28 October 2014 15:25, Hermann Herz notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nsorry, I'm not that good in js :(!

You can make barColors a function that returns different colours based on\nif the data point is in the weekend.\n. You can alter the options before pushing and calling setData() like this.\n\njavascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line(options);\nchart.options.ykeys.push('y');\nchart.setData(new_data);\n. Currently the best way to do this is just define another line that is the goal, this cannot be done in a barchart ofcourse.\n. Could it be that resp is a json string? Or that the actual data is somewhere deeper in resp?\n. What do you mean by zoom option? \n. There's currently no zoom option. However, you can pass the maxy and miny yourself, so if you make those the max and min of your data it should zoom a bit.\n. You can change any of the options if you set them and then call setData().\nOn 11 November 2014 08:12, Alplob notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello,\nI am using morris.js on one page dynamically refreshed with ajax.

You could however convert the time strings to an integer corresponding to the time first (\"08:15:00\" = 81500). This will make Morris make them the correct height. Then you could use the yLabelFormat option to convert it back to a timestring.\n.

And as for the resizeCallback I don't believe there is one.\n. Hmmm, that's not really built in functionality since that is not how you normally use the chart. That info is now in the hover.

You can use the hovercallback to change the hover element in any way you want.\n. Pfew, not a really nice way, but perhaps you could use goals with a really large goalwidth to achieve something like this. \n. If you change the options object in the graph instance before calling setData on it it will use the new options object. So you could change the ymax/ymin there. \n. graph.options.ymin would also work btw.\n. Could you make a simple jsbin with this shown? It sounds cool.\n. Looks cool. One question,  why have you changed fill-opacity to opacity? \n. Sorry, forgot about this a bit. Looks good to me. \n. Thanks for the pull request.\n. Sounds good, could you change it in the less file instead of in the compiled css?\n. I don't think this is possible\n. It looks like the container has a really low width, can you reproduce this is a jsbin? That way I can say more.\n. You could use the hoverCallback function to change the default contents of the hover tooltip.\n. See https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/518\n. It only works for horizontal bar charts though\n. You can use the li items yourself to get the data into javascript and supply it to the constructor of the graph.\n. The main reason is that there is a million ways to lay out data on a page and it differs per person how that is done. The lib supplies an easy JS interface to give it the data and it would get bloated if every way of supplying data would be integrated into it.\n. Thanks\n. You should probably try adding the morris css file: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/morris.css\n. That Is only if you use line charts, this is an area chart.

It was to make sure the hover didn't block the points in a line graph. I added an extra option to the function to make it centre on y and now all the tests pass.\n.

Hmmm,\n\n\nThat is indeed a weird bug, I'll try to look into it when I have time.\n. Oh, I see it causes some tests to fail. Will check that later.\n. Updated this to not cause an error when null is supplied.\n. This means mostly that you have to much data to show in the graph. Some code to handle the exception would be nice, but physically you're unable to display the data in the graph on the screen real estate you have. \n. First of all, could you remove the compiled js files from your commit? We'll update those in a separate commit. \nAnd I think your second test is broken since it doesn't specify the freePosition option. I also saw some problems with the code that did that. Could you make an example in jsbin that shows what these features are supposed to do? You can reuse this one, just copy your compiled/minified js in there and change the example code.\n. You have removed the compiled files and committed that, which is not what I meant :wink:. That is also why the jsbin doesn't work anymore since the compiled file is not in your git repo. \nCould you make sure that the js files are not changed by your commit?\n. Good call on the tests. Looking forward to that pull request. I see that you changed one of the tests already in this commit. I think it would be better if that was moved to your next one instead of being hidden in this one. \nYou can use git add -p to only add certain lines and not whole files.\n. Oh and the functionality looks good btw. I'll try to merge it when I have time.\n. Could you still do this?\n. I have reported it through the link. They will probably unblock it.\n. Fixed\n. It is indeed because of how the bezier curves work. I don't know enough of the SVG code to know how to make sure this doesn't happen. and smooth: 'false' should indeed remove the problem.\n. I'm using these for dutch values, I haven't taken the effort to make it general an add it to morris itself.\njavascript\nvar options = {\n    dateFormat: function(x) {\n        return new Date(x).toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    xLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    yLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLoceleString('nl-NL');\n    },\n};\n. added yLabelFormat as well.\n. Could you show the issue in a jsbin and could you change the coffeescript file instead of the javascript?\n. Closing this one since there was no response.\n. There is no way to force displaying all the labels. You can rotate them however using yLabelAngle\n. No it's just undocumented as far as I know.\n. You could try using positive numbers, but use xLabelFormat to add a minus\nin front.\nOn Sep 19, 2014 4:18 PM, \"umeshwani\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI am using the Line chart with negative values which are working great.\nhttp://jsbin.com/purayivoleco/1/\nBut I have one question I want to have the -ve values starting from -2006\ninstead of -2012\nis it possible to force that or is there any workaround for the same.\nThanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/496.\n. Could you make a jsbin that shows the functionality?\n. Looks very cool, merging this.\n. Are all these commits related? If so, could you squash them? If not, could you make separate pull requests for the different things? Also, could you explain what it does, I haven't used donut charts yet.\n. If you use the js file that is currently on the master branch, you can set the pointSize to zero and the points won't grow.\n. First of all, looking good. I like lean projects as well. However, jQuery also has quite a bit of advantages. First of all, browser compatibility. I like it that stuff just works for different platforms.\n\nSecondly, jQuery can also remove bloat from a project. Most people already include it, especially if they use other javascript heavy libs, like this one. As you can see your commits actually added lines to the codebase, because stuff in jQuery needs to be emulated. This can be solved (like some other libs do) by building a version of the library that needs jquery and one that is stand alone. This is something that would have to be added for me to agree to these commits. \nI would love to know what de other developers think of this.\n. This is not possible at the moment. It does seem useful however, so it could be that it will be added in the future.\n. Oh, stupid mistake. I added that for testing myself. And I'll look into the callback, think I've missed that one \n. I changed it to a callback named barClass to have the same type of interface as the barColors callback.\n. Is the code called after document ready? Or did you make a typo in the container element string?\n. I'm quite sure I fixed this with one of my commits relating to horizontal barcharts. Could you check with the latest compiled js file to see if the problem persists? (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morrisjs/morris.js/master/morris.js)\n. Ah, I see what you mean. You can use the padding option in that case. By default it's 25. It seems undocumented.\n. If you want you can make a pull request against the gh-pages branch to document it.\n. Hmm, I have no clue why this is happening.\n. Yes, it is because of the something in the code on git. Changing the demo to the latest code on github causes the same in that example. The latest release code doesn't have the problem. So you should try using that one.\n. No, you should use the one in the zip on the main site: https://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/\nThe one on github is an \"unofficial\" build, because a couple of people wanted horizontal bar charts.\n. Could you make a jsbin where you reproduce the error? It's impossible to know what's wrong otherwise.\n. I have the same problem myself, but haven't figured out why it is slow with a lot of data. \n. It is not yet in the compiled js, only in the coffee code. You can build a js file yourself though by cloning the repository and following these instructions: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#developer-quick-start\n. Combining angled labels with setting lower xLabelMargin should probably work.\n. I was hoping to help @luben123. For you I would suggest moddifiying your xLabelFormat to output nothing for the months you don't want to show. \nA less hacky option would be making a pull request where you add a quarter option here:\nhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/1c66cfc4ac7b23d324f131bec7739265887e30fc/lib/morris.line.coffee#L431\n. Yes, something like that.\nI think you might need modulo for initialising the start so it will actually be the same months for every plot. Also, I'm quite sure the +3 in the format should be a +1, since I think it is for getting the actual month number instead of a 0 for January.\nCould you change that and test it yourself a bit. If it works I could add it to to the coffee, but you could also make a pull request yourself.\n. It's good that you multiplied it by 3, it is used by the auto chooser. What\nI meant with the modulo was this:\nstart: function(d) {\n    return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth() - (d.getMonth()%3), 1);\n  },\nOn 28 October 2014 15:25, Hermann Herz notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nsorry, I'm not that good in js :(!

You can make barColors a function that returns different colours based on\nif the data point is in the weekend.\n. You can alter the options before pushing and calling setData() like this.\n\njavascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line(options);\nchart.options.ykeys.push('y');\nchart.setData(new_data);\n. Currently the best way to do this is just define another line that is the goal, this cannot be done in a barchart ofcourse.\n. Could it be that resp is a json string? Or that the actual data is somewhere deeper in resp?\n. What do you mean by zoom option? \n. There's currently no zoom option. However, you can pass the maxy and miny yourself, so if you make those the max and min of your data it should zoom a bit.\n. You can change any of the options if you set them and then call setData().\nOn 11 November 2014 08:12, Alplob notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello,\nI am using morris.js on one page dynamically refreshed with ajax.

This has been fixed by #479 \n. This is not possible, but making a pull request should probably not be that hard.\n. It is not built in. You could however convert the time strings to an integer corresponding to the time first (\"08:15:00\" = 81500). This will make Morris make them the correct height. Then you could use the yLabelFormat option to convert it back to a timestring.\n.

Looks great. Could you squash the commits and remove the changes to the js files? I will rebuild those in another commit.\n. Looks good, will merge it after Travis gives the OK.\n. I have no experience with publishing something on npm. I don't use node myself, so I don't really want to put much time in it as well.

And as for the resizeCallback I don't believe there is one.\n. Hmmm, that's not really built in functionality since that is not how you normally use the chart. That info is now in the hover.

You can use the hovercallback to change the hover element in any way you want.\n. Pfew, not a really nice way, but perhaps you could use goals with a really large goalwidth to achieve something like this. \n. If you change the options object in the graph instance before calling setData on it it will use the new options object. So you could change the ymax/ymin there. \n. graph.options.ymin would also work btw.\n. Could you make a simple jsbin with this shown? It sounds cool.\n. Looks cool. One question,  why have you changed fill-opacity to opacity? \n. Sorry, forgot about this a bit. Looks good to me. \n. Thanks for the pull request.\n. Sounds good, could you change it in the less file instead of in the compiled css?\n. I don't think this is possible\n. It looks like the container has a really low width, can you reproduce this is a jsbin? That way I can say more.\n. You could use the hoverCallback function to change the default contents of the hover tooltip.\n. See https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/518\n. It only works for horizontal bar charts though\n. You can use the li items yourself to get the data into javascript and supply it to the constructor of the graph.\n. The main reason is that there is a million ways to lay out data on a page and it differs per person how that is done. The lib supplies an easy JS interface to give it the data and it would get bloated if every way of supplying data would be integrated into it.\n. Thanks\n. You should probably try adding the morris css file: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/morris.css\n. That Is only if you use line charts, this is an area chart.

My 2 cents:\nI believe labeling the pie chart is important, so you can 'get' the distribution without having to build a mental model ([this color = this category, color2 = category 2, etc]). My reports need to be printed for management so the labeling is crucial.\nIt is indeed difficult.\n. yes, fixed in master, thanks!\n. yes I do, but with non-continous data, it doesn't work. Look at my screenshot, the hover is full of noise. Instead, it should only state: 2012-01-24 KVG: 14.16 because that's the only point for that day. Currently, the user's eye must scan/filter all the noise (the n/a) before reaching the relevant data at the end.\nMy suggestion 2 is a consequence of cleaning the hover (removing the n/a) because if you do, you don't have a legend anymore.\nIf you don't find it relevant, is there a easy way of getting which color is selected for which serie?\n. Ok, thanks for the help! I'll branch out to remove the n/a.\n. Oh yes, it actually looks quite good like this.\n. This is great but I feel the following improvements are needed:\n- in the label there should be a total value displayed (of all the series)\n  For Bar in general:\n- an option to display the value below the top of the bar segment.\neg: http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/754/Beautiful-CSS-Stack-Bar-Graphs\n.

I've faced issues with one application i've build once. The pie chart was about 99.99% one category and 0.01% another (I was using raphael.js back then). The result? The pie was all one slice and it was a fight to hover the super-tinny slice representing the minor category.\nI think that for values that are lower than ... maybe 2% the size of the slice should stay equal. The user will understand that the slice have \"negligible\" value and can represent almost nothing, but at same time he will still be able to hover it without problems.\nJust a tip. :)\n. :+1: \n.

In fact, all it does are improvements. Its always better to use vanilla JavaScript instead of third part libraries, its better for performance, it becomes more independent, it leaves to the user the choice to use or not other libraries, etc.\nOf course its not that jQuery is bad, but if we can make a plugin work universally and be agnostic from most libraries (yeah Raphael.js still a must of course), why not do it?\nI'm voting up for this and don't see any reasonable reason not to accept it. :+1: \n.

    "tiraeth": "Due to fact that right now values are taken by their position in Array, it's not easy to fork it. The whole hover rendering (and generating) method needs to be replaced to achieve this. I tried and have come to these conclusions.\nPersonal opinion: I think that Morris.Hover could be separated same way the Morris.Grid is, and using multiple inheritance drawing hovers can be more flexible then. After that, the sorting method could be implemented easily with perspectives for future changes.\n. :+1: on that!\n. When you want to show a trend. For example, you have a line graph that shows you the trend of your site's visits for example. And this is a polyline. You want to compare this value to the whole segment (e.g. other sites within the same network). You can show the segment's average value as a smooth path.\nThis is one use case for it.\nAs another enhancement I would recommend adding styling to the chart so I can modify the font of categories/y-labels and other things. It would be nice to have a map that would be extended with default values, just like Highcharts allows me. Right now the chart itself is not easily customizable. But these are things I may be working on later due to things I am going to use Morris.js with.\n. Cool, thanks! I am thinking about one more (or two) addons/fixes. The grid. I think that it would be useful to have no horizontal lines (right now, as far as I remember, you can't have it configured) or have vertical lines (grid) in chosen configuration (interval or per category).\nSome can find useful to draw grid behind the graph. If we could achieve it, it would be awesome.\n. I think that because Morris.Grid has been introduced, this is now easier than before. Goals and Events could be implemented to Morris.Grid class to allow, respectively, mark value goals and date events.\nThe question that probably needs an answer is whether grid lines should respect set goals/events in a context of including them in grid drawing cycle.\nOther feature that can be implemented are series-related events that would display a flag at chosen position on series' path.\n. PR #103 adds this functionality. I keep my fingers crossed for accepting this feature :-)\n. ##### How to boost user experience?\nDisable dateFormat for drawing x-axis labels and allow Morris to put raw x-values :-)\nHow to define gradient in barFillColors?\nTo setup gradient used for filling a particular series' bars, you have to provide colors, separated by space, for each series. You can provide either two or three colors (for creating 2-color or 3-color gradient, respectively), for example:\njavascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'graph',\n  data: [\n    {x: '2011 Q1', y: 3, z: 2, a: 3},\n    {x: '2011 Q2', y: 2, z: 1, a: 1},\n    {x: '2011 Q3', y: 0, z: 2, a: 4},\n    {x: '2011 Q4', y: 4, z: 4, a: 3}\n  ],\n  xkey: 'x',\n  ykeys: ['y', 'z', 'a'],\n  labels: ['Y', 'Z', 'A'],\n  barFillColors: [\n    '#aaa #555',      // from light gray to dark gray (top to bottom)\n    '#555 #aaa black' // from dark day, through light gray, to black\n  ]\n});\nHint: All color strings valid for Raphael.color() can be used with Morris.Bar. Just don't use space when using rgb, hsb, or hsl color description.\n. Waiting for your changes :+1:\n. Sweet!\nAnyway, I will still need to fork Morris.Bar because I do need gradient support for fill attribute. I will work on it and try to give you more solid method for defining bar colors/gradients.\n. Set option: hideHover to false. This will prevent the popup from being constantly displayed on the graph. It will appear only when you hover the bar/group of bars.\n. Morris.Bar extends Morris.Line and utilizes this parameter. Setting it to false should be enough and I assure you it is.\n. Set this parameter to true. I can't explain why I was saying it's false.\n. That's always a solution. I thought about gradients because the designer which I am working currently with is putting gradient almost everywhere if the design style requires it :grinning: I am fine with the callback solution. To be honest, I am in a need of either callback or built-in support for gradients :smiley:\n. :+1:\nCoffeescript's reduce is also better than for or $.each in some cases. I used it in Morris.Pie :grinning:\n. Forgot to mention that there is also a sortData option with true|false|\"asc\"|\"desc\" values (true implies \"asc\"). This allows you to sort data by value before creating and rendering segments.\n. I thought the same after writing it (I intentionally was mocking function names and behaviour from Morris.Donut). Looking forward for the updated version.\nCode extraction, IMO, can be done also on hovering (line, area, bar, maybe scatter can be added as an additional plot type, or just as an option to Morris.Line). But these require other requests/issues to be created.\n. I will prepare a fix in couple of hours.\n. Tyler, I recommend waiting some time. Olly is going to rewrite hover to use HTML popups and customizing it will be much more simpler.\n. This will be difficult as Morris.Grid does not support replacing axis.\n. I suppose you both are talking about HTML-ifing hover popups. This is a subject of Olly's current scope on Morris, as far as I know. We have to wait some time until refactorization of popups is done and fully handled by HTML.\n. This is difficult. We have two cases:\n1. Both data collections contain same xkey values (same categories).\n2. Each collection has it's own set of categories (different xkey values).\nOf course case number 1 is easier to implement. Also, we will need to handle grid drawing in such way that right axis is properly scaled using left axis' grid lines. Please also remember that hovering is per category not per series' point.\n. I think this is out of the scope for the functionality that should be provided with Morris. Probably you will need to prepare a hack for yourself thus I haven't seen anything that would work as you want it to work. What's the purpose of hiding axis labels?\n. Please wait some time until Morris.Hover is derived for handling popups and co-work with hilights. It's options list will for sure provide an ability to disable popups.\n. They could but I prefer loose coupling between library's elements and picked the multiple inheritance as they way of handling hovering. Anyway, the decision is yours - if you prefer to combine the Morris.Hover with Morris.Grid - you're free to do so. I will be happy with any kind of merge of the functionality.\nI am currently thinking of providing same functionality to Morris.Donut and Morris.Pie of mine (which I am looking forward to be merged into master, after some refactoring and combining done with donut, maybe single class?). Having HTML hovering there would handle current labeling for Donut while allowing users to decide how they want to show the popup.\nAlso, when I proposed alerts and goals I was waiting for HTML hover to provide functionality also to these two new elements of Line/Area charts.\nPreferably, for each hover event a callback (using on for Morris.EventEmitter) for more user action would be triggered. This will for sure allow customizing the position, content, and styling of the popup - if the case requires it.\n. LGTM. Please prepare a separete example file and revert bar.html to the original one. This will allow Olly to merge changes with one click :-)\n. Please disable time parsing for first chart. This may be the issue.\n. This is not a scope of functionality that Morris.js provides. To display the gauge directly please use Raphael.\nFortunately I was working on such functionality because I needed it too. It's here: https://gist.github.com/4139118\nI may prepare a PR for this but I am not sure if such functionality is needed.\n. This is for sure a good thing to have. When Olly merges my HTML popup replacement I will work on providing same functionality for events/goals. Right now it isn't easy to implement labels for events/goals. Please remember that the label shouldn't be covered by a series popup.\n. Each segment has it's own path. What does that mean? It means that we can use Element.click() on it (http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.click).\nI am currently going to rewrite Pie and Donut as I need them both in my cases and see the usefullness of this feature. Please hold few days until the push request is presented.\n. My PR for Pie and Donut charts include these callbacks. Line/Area/Bar chart do not support it. Yet.\n. https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/133 Support for click event in current master branch.\n. In my opinion (and Google's), not at all. The whole point of donut is to show multiple series. And this is something I am currently working on - multiple series per one donut chart (that's why I presented the class with @options.width).\nAnyway, when we switch the labelling to HTML (please consider my other PR) it will be possible to customize it so it can be drawn inside the hole.\nTherefore I have multiple cases where I need donut chart and don't find it useful to have something inside the hole.\n. So you can merge the PR as it is now or wait few days (maybe just 48hrs) until a commit with multiple series support is added :)\n. Sure, I will provide as much tests as I can for such functionality.\nIf it goes to pre-saving existing behaviour. Having fully functioning donut chart (with multiple series) won't work well with label inside the hole. I recommend dropping such functionality. Having current way of displaying the label is sufficient in my opinion. When you decide to include HTML hovers, I can work on Pie and Donut to support it.\n. Olly, can you merge this PR please?\n. Hilight does not utilize css only. So this won't work at all. Also, Morris is using some internal events to show the popup and so on.\nThe only solution is to provide a public api inside Morris that will be available for users, e.g. hilighting specific data row (but this, I suppose, works now).\n. JavaScript's code gets executed before the DOM contains #annual element. Put the javascript after the div or use jQuery.ready().\n. As far as I know, this is already done by dynaum as stacked bars in #120.\n. I will look into #120 and try to provide such functionality as an add-on to\nstacked bars.\n. Tomorrow I will introduce a new option to Morris.Bar called accumulate: true|false (default: true). If it's value is true, the chart will look as it looks now (for each data row the upper bound for the bar will be the sum of all series in this row) but if you set it to false, each data row series will get sorted ascending and drew bottom-up so the upper bound will be the maximum for the given row. In this case, you will achieve exactly what you expect to get.\n. #148 Somehow solves @dynaum's issue, but it requires to have consistent value domain for the whole chart (so no mixing %'s and #'s is allowed).\n. This is UI-specific and in my opinion should be handled on your end. For instance, you can test .data property of the object created with Morris.Line to see if the data is set correctly and if not - provide a placeholder.\n. The solution is to, in my opinion, provide a multi-usage option barRadius which would accept values in exactly the same manner as CSS property border-radius does.\n- barRadius: \"none\" (no rounded corners)\n- barRadius: \"5px\" (all to 5px)\n- barRadius: \"5px 6px\" (left corners 5px, right corners 6px\n- barRadius: \"5px 6px 7px\" (left corners 5px, right top corner 6px right bottom corner 7px)\n- barRadius: \"5px 6px 7px 8px\" (as above but bottom left corner 8px)\nAnd get rid of barShape option.\n. The encapsulation you proposed breaks at least one (Single Responsibility) of the principles from SOLID and other good practices. If Morris goes that way, don't want to imagine what it will look like after few months.\nMaking Morris.js SVG-dependant you're taking at last 15% of the market off the lane for using it. I'd stick to morris-provided events and incrementally update the list of options, providing more customization settings.\n. Very ugly PR, I know. But there are many who are waiting for this.\n. Yes it does.\n``` javascript\nvar options = {}; // you know what to do with it...\nvar chart = new Morris.Pie(options);\nchart.on('click', function(id, row){\n  console.log(id, row);\n});\nchart.on('hover', function(id, row){\n  console.log(id, row);\n});\n```\n. I do understand your POV. But I think that if you want Morris to be used wider (and I think you want) some functionality should be changed to use the ones users are used to.\nI think that tooltips should be controlled by CSS (html ones, like in other charts). Displaying the value (and label) as you do right now could be controlled by hover event on the chart. I think that you should support the conventional behaviour and give people a way to accomplish more sophisticated changes.\nAnd more, I think that donut chart should in near future support multiple series, because that's the purpose of displaying data in donut instead of a pie.\n. Usage simplicity (and small amount of code) does not imply the lack of some functionaltiy. But I understand you and won't insist on pushing functionality you object to. Others can always use one of forked repositories (mine, for instance) if they want to.\nThanks for the great work you are doing here :+1:\n. See /examples directory. These are using the new charts.\n. This is also something I need. E.g. I am displaying number of people doing something and get yLabels with values like 5.25 people. Awkward, isn't it ;) ?\nProbably I will post a PR in a couple of days. This will also include rounding to nearest 10-th, 100-th and so on.\n.

Please take a look into the source code and see available options.\n. Available in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/149. Waiting until @oesmith merges it.\n. First of all, what kind of conflict do you experience? Morris.js requires jQuery and Raphael.js. If there is a conflict between MooTools and jQuery, you can try to load jQuery in non-conflict mode.\nSecondly, there is no problem with loading chart data from json file or even a web service. Make a GET request for the data using jQuery's or MooTool's AJAX utilities and create instance of chosen Morris chart type using the data you received from AJAX request.\n. Escape quote characters inside the tag, because console.log($('#genders_chart').data('emp_spec_views')) probably will yeld nothing more that just [{.\n. I meant the spot where you display content_tag. I suspect that you are displaying something like this (with errors):\nhtml\n<div data-emp_spec_views=\"[{\"a\": \"b\"}]\"></div>\n. Three solutions:\n1. Update your content_tag in ERB to use html_safe string with json code (google it).\n2. Don't use data attribute for storing such data - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution1-erb\n3. Don't duplicate data that you already have in the table - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution2-erb\n. In Morris.Bar pass data variable as data key in options, like:\njavascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'genders_chart',\n  data: data,\n  xkey: 'specialization_name',\n  ykeys: ['number_of_employees'],\n  labels: ['Number Of Employees'],\n  hideHover: 'true',\n  barColors: function (row, series, type) {\n    if (type === 'bar') {\n      var blue = Math.floor(255 * row.y / this.ymax);\n      return 'rgb(' + blue + ',0,0)';\n    }\n    else {\n      return '#000';\n    }\n  }\n});\n. Use Morris.Donut instead of Morris.Bar to display it in donut chart. There is no pie chart in Morris' master branch. You will have to use my fork with new pie/donut charts.\n. setData()? This will automatically call redraw if second parameter is omitted.\n. ``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Pie({ ... });\nvar asyncCallback = function(newData) {\n  chart.setData(newData); // this will redraw the chart\n};\n``\n. Perhaps. Why are you replacing the data when you receive a single element? When received, append it to the array (graph_data) and callsetData` with the appended array.\n``` javascript\nvar graph_data = [{time:\"2013-04-03\", value: \"4\"}];\nvar shoreham_g = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  data: graph_data,\n  xkey: 'time',\n  ykeys: ['value'],\n  labels: ['wind'],\n  gridEnabled: false\n});\nvar pusher = new Pusher('xxxx');\nvar channel_weather = pusher.subscribe('weather-channel');\nchannel_weather.bind('new_shoreham_event', function(data){\n  graph_data.push({\n    time: data.observation_time,\n    value: data.windspeedMiles\n  });\nshoreham_g.setData(graph_data);\n});\n```\n. Can you provide a code that you are using? Put it in jsbin.com or similiar. No idea what you're doing wrong without taking a look at the code.\n. Which version of Morris are you using? Can you reproduce the error using jsbin.com or similiar?\n. Edit: I've managed to disable the auto select by commenting out line 1430 in morris.js, but is there a way to deselect the segment after mouse out?\nImpossible in master. Possible in my version of dunut/pie.\nEdit2: Also, is there a callback when entering, leaving a segment? I'd like to create a inner circle div that get's faded in when a user hovers on a segment, and have it faded out when the users leaves it.\nAlso not possible. In my version, I support hover action, but no separation on over/out. Yet\u2026\n. Replace line https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L102 with:\ncoffeescript\n    @fire 'click', idx, @data[idx]\nYou can remove line 101.\nThe \"unused variable\" in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/commit/5d9bf447c517531542a9d294f99d01d963892a8b was used actually there. Also, replacing idx with index broke the above line.\nI will prepare a PR in a sec.\n. @oesmith ping\n. Can you please add some specs to make sure everything works as it should?\nAnd why are you displaying a regular date (if it's correct, probably the first day of given week) in fmt? Shouldn't it we something like \"2013 W5\"?\n. Commit the changes and push to your branch.\nIf it goes to writing specs, take a look in spec folder to see all tests\nfor Morris.\n12 kwi 2013 15:37, \"t3chn0r\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\nAny idea where I have to go to edit the PR?

To update your PR just push changes to your repository's branch.\n\nbash\n$ git commit -m 'some additional updates'\n$ git push origin patch-1\nAll new commits for this branch will automatically update this PR.\n. It's not a good idea to add behaviour to existing objects/classes that you don't own. I think that fmt function should calculate the week number itself.\n. Yes, events are for vertical lines, and goals are for horizontal lines.\n. It means that even if you provide dates as xkeys, Morris won't re-order the data like it does for Line and Area charts. It will treat xkeys like categories.\nYou probably misunderstood the note.\n. Because you did not use an array in eventLineColors option. See code below.\njavascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  xkey: 'time',\n  xLabelMargin: 1,\n  data: graph_data,\n  ykeys: ['a','b'],\n  labels: ['aa','bb'],\n  events: ['2013-02-01','2013-02-02','2013-02-05'],\n  eventLineColors:[\"#999\"]\n});\n. You can try to use formatter for Y Axis. So provide inversed values (1/y) to data and format it properly (once again use 1/y).\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/641/\n. You have to also change the data set you're passing to Morris.\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/650/\n. Please look into the code next time. You can re-use Morris.commas in your formatted (in fact it is used in default formatting callback).\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/654/\n. Not possible in oesmith/master. Somehow standarized in my fork but also not able to change the styling on-the-fly.\nThere was an idea of providing hovers built with HTML (like line charts) so users could style them and even display in the donut's hole. But it's not (and probably won't be) implemented.\n. Can you put the example on jsbin.com or something similar?\n. @oesmith I may find some time and develop xLabels rotation.\n. Though about it too, but wasn't sure if it should be introduced right now. :+1: \n. 1. Add const to bar values.\n2. Use yLabelFormat to show the value without the consts.\nExample: http://jsbin.com/ufenus/1/ - assumes that data is already modified with const of value 40.\n. You need a server-side tool for conversion. You can use node.js with PhantomJS for this, for example. SVG can be converted to high-res PNG.\n. I would go with different values for axes instead of separate options, like:\n- true or both for both enabled\n- false for both disabled\n- x for X enabled, Y disabled\n- y for X disabled, Y enabled\nThe advantage of the proposed solution is that we're not introducing BCB (you don't do so either but this don't add additional options).\n. Their y-position should be rounded to the nearest pixel and shifted by 0.5px. Prepare a PR if you want to fix this.\n. Due to fact that right now values are taken by their position in Array, it's not easy to fork it. The whole hover rendering (and generating) method needs to be replaced to achieve this. I tried and have come to these conclusions.\nPersonal opinion: I think that Morris.Hover could be separated same way the Morris.Grid is, and using multiple inheritance drawing hovers can be more flexible then. After that, the sorting method could be implemented easily with perspectives for future changes.\n. :+1: on that!\n. When you want to show a trend. For example, you have a line graph that shows you the trend of your site's visits for example. And this is a polyline. You want to compare this value to the whole segment (e.g. other sites within the same network). You can show the segment's average value as a smooth path.\nThis is one use case for it.\nAs another enhancement I would recommend adding styling to the chart so I can modify the font of categories/y-labels and other things. It would be nice to have a map that would be extended with default values, just like Highcharts allows me. Right now the chart itself is not easily customizable. But these are things I may be working on later due to things I am going to use Morris.js with.\n. Cool, thanks! I am thinking about one more (or two) addons/fixes. The grid. I think that it would be useful to have no horizontal lines (right now, as far as I remember, you can't have it configured) or have vertical lines (grid) in chosen configuration (interval or per category).\nSome can find useful to draw grid behind the graph. If we could achieve it, it would be awesome.\n. I think that because Morris.Grid has been introduced, this is now easier than before. Goals and Events could be implemented to Morris.Grid class to allow, respectively, mark value goals and date events.\nThe question that probably needs an answer is whether grid lines should respect set goals/events in a context of including them in grid drawing cycle.\nOther feature that can be implemented are series-related events that would display a flag at chosen position on series' path.\n. PR #103 adds this functionality. I keep my fingers crossed for accepting this feature :-)\n. ##### How to boost user experience?\nDisable dateFormat for drawing x-axis labels and allow Morris to put raw x-values :-)\nHow to define gradient in barFillColors?\nTo setup gradient used for filling a particular series' bars, you have to provide colors, separated by space, for each series. You can provide either two or three colors (for creating 2-color or 3-color gradient, respectively), for example:\njavascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'graph',\n  data: [\n    {x: '2011 Q1', y: 3, z: 2, a: 3},\n    {x: '2011 Q2', y: 2, z: 1, a: 1},\n    {x: '2011 Q3', y: 0, z: 2, a: 4},\n    {x: '2011 Q4', y: 4, z: 4, a: 3}\n  ],\n  xkey: 'x',\n  ykeys: ['y', 'z', 'a'],\n  labels: ['Y', 'Z', 'A'],\n  barFillColors: [\n    '#aaa #555',      // from light gray to dark gray (top to bottom)\n    '#555 #aaa black' // from dark day, through light gray, to black\n  ]\n});\nHint: All color strings valid for Raphael.color() can be used with Morris.Bar. Just don't use space when using rgb, hsb, or hsl color description.\n. Waiting for your changes :+1:\n. Sweet!\nAnyway, I will still need to fork Morris.Bar because I do need gradient support for fill attribute. I will work on it and try to give you more solid method for defining bar colors/gradients.\n. Set option: hideHover to false. This will prevent the popup from being constantly displayed on the graph. It will appear only when you hover the bar/group of bars.\n. Morris.Bar extends Morris.Line and utilizes this parameter. Setting it to false should be enough and I assure you it is.\n. Set this parameter to true. I can't explain why I was saying it's false.\n. That's always a solution. I thought about gradients because the designer which I am working currently with is putting gradient almost everywhere if the design style requires it :grinning: I am fine with the callback solution. To be honest, I am in a need of either callback or built-in support for gradients :smiley:\n. :+1:\nCoffeescript's reduce is also better than for or $.each in some cases. I used it in Morris.Pie :grinning:\n. Forgot to mention that there is also a sortData option with true|false|\"asc\"|\"desc\" values (true implies \"asc\"). This allows you to sort data by value before creating and rendering segments.\n. I thought the same after writing it (I intentionally was mocking function names and behaviour from Morris.Donut). Looking forward for the updated version.\nCode extraction, IMO, can be done also on hovering (line, area, bar, maybe scatter can be added as an additional plot type, or just as an option to Morris.Line). But these require other requests/issues to be created.\n. I will prepare a fix in couple of hours.\n. Tyler, I recommend waiting some time. Olly is going to rewrite hover to use HTML popups and customizing it will be much more simpler.\n. This will be difficult as Morris.Grid does not support replacing axis.\n. I suppose you both are talking about HTML-ifing hover popups. This is a subject of Olly's current scope on Morris, as far as I know. We have to wait some time until refactorization of popups is done and fully handled by HTML.\n. This is difficult. We have two cases:\n1. Both data collections contain same xkey values (same categories).\n2. Each collection has it's own set of categories (different xkey values).\nOf course case number 1 is easier to implement. Also, we will need to handle grid drawing in such way that right axis is properly scaled using left axis' grid lines. Please also remember that hovering is per category not per series' point.\n. I think this is out of the scope for the functionality that should be provided with Morris. Probably you will need to prepare a hack for yourself thus I haven't seen anything that would work as you want it to work. What's the purpose of hiding axis labels?\n. Please wait some time until Morris.Hover is derived for handling popups and co-work with hilights. It's options list will for sure provide an ability to disable popups.\n. They could but I prefer loose coupling between library's elements and picked the multiple inheritance as they way of handling hovering. Anyway, the decision is yours - if you prefer to combine the Morris.Hover with Morris.Grid - you're free to do so. I will be happy with any kind of merge of the functionality.\nI am currently thinking of providing same functionality to Morris.Donut and Morris.Pie of mine (which I am looking forward to be merged into master, after some refactoring and combining done with donut, maybe single class?). Having HTML hovering there would handle current labeling for Donut while allowing users to decide how they want to show the popup.\nAlso, when I proposed alerts and goals I was waiting for HTML hover to provide functionality also to these two new elements of Line/Area charts.\nPreferably, for each hover event a callback (using on for Morris.EventEmitter) for more user action would be triggered. This will for sure allow customizing the position, content, and styling of the popup - if the case requires it.\n. LGTM. Please prepare a separete example file and revert bar.html to the original one. This will allow Olly to merge changes with one click :-)\n. Please disable time parsing for first chart. This may be the issue.\n. This is not a scope of functionality that Morris.js provides. To display the gauge directly please use Raphael.\nFortunately I was working on such functionality because I needed it too. It's here: https://gist.github.com/4139118\nI may prepare a PR for this but I am not sure if such functionality is needed.\n. This is for sure a good thing to have. When Olly merges my HTML popup replacement I will work on providing same functionality for events/goals. Right now it isn't easy to implement labels for events/goals. Please remember that the label shouldn't be covered by a series popup.\n. Each segment has it's own path. What does that mean? It means that we can use Element.click() on it (http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.click).\nI am currently going to rewrite Pie and Donut as I need them both in my cases and see the usefullness of this feature. Please hold few days until the push request is presented.\n. My PR for Pie and Donut charts include these callbacks. Line/Area/Bar chart do not support it. Yet.\n. https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/133 Support for click event in current master branch.\n. In my opinion (and Google's), not at all. The whole point of donut is to show multiple series. And this is something I am currently working on - multiple series per one donut chart (that's why I presented the class with @options.width).\nAnyway, when we switch the labelling to HTML (please consider my other PR) it will be possible to customize it so it can be drawn inside the hole.\nTherefore I have multiple cases where I need donut chart and don't find it useful to have something inside the hole.\n. So you can merge the PR as it is now or wait few days (maybe just 48hrs) until a commit with multiple series support is added :)\n. Sure, I will provide as much tests as I can for such functionality.\nIf it goes to pre-saving existing behaviour. Having fully functioning donut chart (with multiple series) won't work well with label inside the hole. I recommend dropping such functionality. Having current way of displaying the label is sufficient in my opinion. When you decide to include HTML hovers, I can work on Pie and Donut to support it.\n. Olly, can you merge this PR please?\n. Hilight does not utilize css only. So this won't work at all. Also, Morris is using some internal events to show the popup and so on.\nThe only solution is to provide a public api inside Morris that will be available for users, e.g. hilighting specific data row (but this, I suppose, works now).\n.

The encapsulation you proposed breaks at least one (Single Responsibility) of the principles from SOLID and other good practices.

C: I'd rather see pull requests with a single feature - it makes it easier to merge quickly and focus discussion.\nA: Are you really lurking for a bunch of small PRs? This is not so big...\nC: I'm not sure I see the point of customising the hover CSS prefix. (...)\nA: I agree.\nC: I like the idea of changing the gravity of the hover box, but I'm not sold on being able to overflow the container.\nA: If there is a way of defining gravity, there should be a way to enable overflowing.\n. Have you included the generated css file? Since few weeks morris.js is using HTML labels which require some styling. The screen you're showing tells me that you did not include the css file.\n. Include CSS file for tooltip.\n12 sty 2013 16:43, \"Ritvvij Parrikh\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\nHi, I am using Bar Chart. All is well except that the hover over text is\nnot being displayed on the bar but instead on left bottom side. For image,\nplease see\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/14294900/morris-js-bar-chart-not-rendering-hover-over-text\nCan someone please advice what am I doing wrong?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/156.\n. You can use a callback function as lineColors property. Please refer to the source code and you will find which (and in what order) parameters/variables will be available to you.\n. Right now you have to provide a callback function for lineColors options parameter and not rely on the array.\n\nPlease wait until tomorrow and I will provide you with a working example on jsfiddle.com.\n. Here you go mate: http://jsfiddle.net/ZnzbB/\nI decided to drop the idea of callback function (the implementation gets longer than it's necessary) so I came up with additional method for Morris.Line (injected using prototype-inheritance). This seems to look nicer.\n. Please find my bug fix in issues list that refer this problem.\n24 sty 2013 11:32, \"adampope\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\nThe new HTML only hover info windows from #134https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/134don't obey the hideHover option so they don't disappear when you move your\nmouse out of a graph\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/169.\n. https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/153\n\nThere is no true/false anymore. Please take a look into the source code and see available options.\n. Available in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/149. Waiting until @oesmith merges it.\n. First of all, what kind of conflict do you experience? Morris.js requires jQuery and Raphael.js. If there is a conflict between MooTools and jQuery, you can try to load jQuery in non-conflict mode.\nSecondly, there is no problem with loading chart data from json file or even a web service. Make a GET request for the data using jQuery's or MooTool's AJAX utilities and create instance of chosen Morris chart type using the data you received from AJAX request.\n. Escape quote characters inside the tag, because console.log($('#genders_chart').data('emp_spec_views')) probably will yeld nothing more that just [{.\n. I meant the spot where you display content_tag. I suspect that you are displaying something like this (with errors):\nhtml\n<div data-emp_spec_views=\"[{\"a\": \"b\"}]\"></div>\n. Three solutions:\n1. Update your content_tag in ERB to use html_safe string with json code (google it).\n2. Don't use data attribute for storing such data - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution1-erb\n3. Don't duplicate data that you already have in the table - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution2-erb\n. In Morris.Bar pass data variable as data key in options, like:\njavascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'genders_chart',\n  data: data,\n  xkey: 'specialization_name',\n  ykeys: ['number_of_employees'],\n  labels: ['Number Of Employees'],\n  hideHover: 'true',\n  barColors: function (row, series, type) {\n    if (type === 'bar') {\n      var blue = Math.floor(255 * row.y / this.ymax);\n      return 'rgb(' + blue + ',0,0)';\n    }\n    else {\n      return '#000';\n    }\n  }\n});\n. Use Morris.Donut instead of Morris.Bar to display it in donut chart. There is no pie chart in Morris' master branch. You will have to use my fork with new pie/donut charts.\n. setData()? This will automatically call redraw if second parameter is omitted.\n. ``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Pie({ ... });\nvar asyncCallback = function(newData) {\n  chart.setData(newData); // this will redraw the chart\n};\n``\n. Perhaps. Why are you replacing the data when you receive a single element? When received, append it to the array (graph_data) and callsetData` with the appended array.\n``` javascript\nvar graph_data = [{time:\"2013-04-03\", value: \"4\"}];\nvar shoreham_g = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  data: graph_data,\n  xkey: 'time',\n  ykeys: ['value'],\n  labels: ['wind'],\n  gridEnabled: false\n});\nvar pusher = new Pusher('xxxx');\nvar channel_weather = pusher.subscribe('weather-channel');\nchannel_weather.bind('new_shoreham_event', function(data){\n  graph_data.push({\n    time: data.observation_time,\n    value: data.windspeedMiles\n  });\nshoreham_g.setData(graph_data);\n});\n```\n. Can you provide a code that you are using? Put it in jsbin.com or similiar. No idea what you're doing wrong without taking a look at the code.\n. Which version of Morris are you using? Can you reproduce the error using jsbin.com or similiar?\n. Edit: I've managed to disable the auto select by commenting out line 1430 in morris.js, but is there a way to deselect the segment after mouse out?\nImpossible in master. Possible in my version of dunut/pie.\nEdit2: Also, is there a callback when entering, leaving a segment? I'd like to create a inner circle div that get's faded in when a user hovers on a segment, and have it faded out when the users leaves it.\nAlso not possible. In my version, I support hover action, but no separation on over/out. Yet\u2026\n. Replace line https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L102 with:\ncoffeescript\n    @fire 'click', idx, @data[idx]\nYou can remove line 101.\nThe \"unused variable\" in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/commit/5d9bf447c517531542a9d294f99d01d963892a8b was used actually there. Also, replacing idx with index broke the above line.\nI will prepare a PR in a sec.\n. @oesmith ping\n. Can you please add some specs to make sure everything works as it should?\nAnd why are you displaying a regular date (if it's correct, probably the first day of given week) in fmt? Shouldn't it we something like \"2013 W5\"?\n. Commit the changes and push to your branch.\nIf it goes to writing specs, take a look in spec folder to see all tests\nfor Morris.\n12 kwi 2013 15:37, \"t3chn0r\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\nAny idea where I have to go to edit the PR? I'm new to Github...\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/219#issuecomment-16293147\n.\n. To update your PR just push changes to your repository's branch.\n\nbash\n$ git commit -m 'some additional updates'\n$ git push origin patch-1\nAll new commits for this branch will automatically update this PR.\n. It's not a good idea to add behaviour to existing objects/classes that you don't own. I think that fmt function should calculate the week number itself.\n. Yes, events are for vertical lines, and goals are for horizontal lines.\n. It means that even if you provide dates as xkeys, Morris won't re-order the data like it does for Line and Area charts. It will treat xkeys like categories.\nYou probably misunderstood the note.\n. Because you did not use an array in eventLineColors option. See code below.\njavascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  xkey: 'time',\n  xLabelMargin: 1,\n  data: graph_data,\n  ykeys: ['a','b'],\n  labels: ['aa','bb'],\n  events: ['2013-02-01','2013-02-02','2013-02-05'],\n  eventLineColors:[\"#999\"]\n});\n. You can try to use formatter for Y Axis. So provide inversed values (1/y) to data and format it properly (once again use 1/y).\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/641/\n. You have to also change the data set you're passing to Morris.\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/650/\n. Please look into the code next time. You can re-use Morris.commas in your formatted (in fact it is used in default formatting callback).\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/654/\n. Not possible in oesmith/master. Somehow standarized in my fork but also not able to change the styling on-the-fly.\nThere was an idea of providing hovers built with HTML (like line charts) so users could style them and even display in the donut's hole. But it's not (and probably won't be) implemented.\n. Can you put the example on jsbin.com or something similar?\n. @oesmith I may find some time and develop xLabels rotation.\n. Though about it too, but wasn't sure if it should be introduced right now. :+1: \n. 1. Add const to bar values.\n2. Use yLabelFormat to show the value without the consts.\nExample: http://jsbin.com/ufenus/1/ - assumes that data is already modified with const of value 40.\n. You need a server-side tool for conversion. You can use node.js with PhantomJS for this, for example. SVG can be converted to high-res PNG.\n. I would go with different values for axes instead of separate options, like:\n- true or both for both enabled\n- false for both disabled\n- x for X enabled, Y disabled\n- y for X disabled, Y enabled\nThe advantage of the proposed solution is that we're not introducing BCB (you don't do so either but this don't add additional options).\n. Their y-position should be rounded to the nearest pixel and shifted by 0.5px. Prepare a PR if you want to fix this.\n. ",

    "sudodoki": "Just deregister handler with $.fn.off for given selector, maybe?\n. Coming back to this PR have few questions:\n1) @oesmith , are you objecting including this Pie-Componennt into core library at all?\n2) @tiraeth, since Morris is rather straightforward, why not implement this as a plugin/component? I did it like this for my build and with few patches it works like a charm.\nOn this matter, too: we should have just a set of common methods, like setData/render etc (this should be laid out somewhere) and anybody will be able to contribute his/her plugin for Morris. I would love to be able to use heatmaps, if needed, without need to switch to some other library.\n. So, there're several implementation PRs for Pie Charts in this repo, namely https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/92, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/149, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/128.\nI did use #149, though it had some issues (I commented on PR) and the main flaw is - single label visible at the time, which kind of spoils whole point of pie chart, IMO.\nShould we kick off this discussion? Maybe, this should not be included as part of v0.5 release.\n. > ember charts - pie seems promising.\n@mkramchandra are you talking about this one? \n. If I understand correctly, this question is outdated. See main page for example.\n. It's in. It was implemented via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/b192a00d685ebe4275ba6c00c1c98aa13a0975e2\n. Guys, be sure to see #340. There might be no updates if you don't contribute back. :crying_cat_face: \n. The X label is kinda trivial, because you can append it and position at your chart element with regualr css. \nPure css Y-axis is a bit trickier. Need to test out this approach which should work in IE above version 7. Some additional logic should be applied for label truncating though.\nThe svg Y-label is rather straightforward and PR for that is https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/299.\n. Looks neat and might be really useful. As well might lay ground for vertical bar charts.\n. Hey, @R-osey, is it still reproducible?\n. There're some projects that're working towards this goal.\nI tried canvg on view of morris examples and it worked quite decent, so might want to use that if you need client side turning into canvas -> img and cannot use server side rendering.\n. There's also https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/321, which shows how to add AMD support on top of browserify, also. @oesmith do you want wrapper to be added as part of build step, or for it to be present in actual source code?\n. Hey, @wojons, thanks for feedback. \nThe issue is, that svgs are generally slower than canvases. Take a look at this SO answer. So we might in the future try to make Morris faster, but that's not an issue for most part at current moment.\n. I assume newer issue should be opened or #346 used. Nevertheless, PRs are welcome in case you still want to contribute :smile_cat: \n. You can use setData() method to change data for element & force redraw.\n. Okay, so main culprit here is probably, this line\nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.grid.coffee#L182\nThe question arise: should callback arity be changed or should we modify options.data as well as data?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/221\n. Consider consulting related issue https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/349.\n. There's no such thing yet,\nThough, you can add\nlast = @options.startPoint || 0 instead of this line\nAnd in your options for chart set\nstartPoint: - Math.PI so that it will start at 12 am.\n. Try using toUTCString()\nnew Date('2013-06-03T22:27:48Z').toUTCString()  // -> \"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 22:27:48 GMT\"\nThe issue here new Date uses your time zone when formatting date, thus the issue. Other possible solution - manually constructing date string, usting getDay(), getFullYear(), getMonth(), getUTCHours(), getUTCMinutes().\n. Please provide plunker or data you set to achieve such result.\n. Hello Daniel, \nit seems to be an issue of rescaling your grid after data update. New scale forces bottom grid line to be not visible.\nAs a temporary solution, you can set padding for your chart.\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/2145/\n. I assume @heruan vocalized this more clearly at https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/322 so will be closing this one for time being.\n. On the failing CI thing: it should install grunt-cli globally now, should I hook it into npm preinstall?\n. There's no bootstrap 3 specific examples in this repo, but there're some in the wild.\n. You can do it like this.\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. For cdn.oesmith.co.uk to serve library when used with https:// a proper SSL certificate is needed, which needs some financing. Why don't use one from cdnjs?\nIt can be found here: //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.4.2/morris.min.js\n. For this purpose I'm using plain \n$(window).on('resize', function() { redoTheChartFunction();});\nWorks like a charm, since Morris is all about percentage and calculating sizes dynamically.\nAnd you might consider using something like (underscore's debounce)[http://underscorejs.org/#debounce] so that you aren't repainting in vain.\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. Sorry, but you edited the resulting js and not the source coffee code. Would also love to see plnkr/jsbin with functionality demo.\n. Will work on this as soon as I get some time on my hands. Thanks for feedback. Should I also add example page?\n. Update PR. Will be doing an example for this one as separate PR.\n. In fact. @oesmith, I would love to become a contributor, even if my only help will be with sorting/labeling issues, reviewing PRs, etc. I do understand your position on keeping Morris clean and simple so I wouldn't be pushy around new feature (like #149) though I'd really like to see that and I do value efforts you and others spent to make Morris what it is.\n. Updated PR. Please review.\n. Pull#300 :bowtie: (even if it's not accepted, it's still number Three-Ouh-Ouh)\n. There came to be couple of issues:\n1) fixed labels to be separated for series, never update PR\n2) Issue with two thin bars side by side - their labels would overlap (same is true for highcharts, btw).\n. I will probably update this, when I figure out how to write some tests. Any ideas on that how to approach that?\n. Same probably goes for label calback, it should be properly executed along the color change.\n. Assume duplicate of #111 \n. Please specify type of chart and the part of chart you're talkign about. Plnkr/jsbin would be perfect.\n. I consider this one good to have and not very hard to implement. :+1: \n. > I would be interested in having the possibility to specify the colors of some dots in my line chart.  \nWhy not use lineColors callback to have something along the lines of\n...\nlineColors: function(row, sidx, type) {\n return row.src.color;\n}\n...\nin your options after you've added colors to data rows?\nP.S. messing with resulting js instead of recompiling from source probably - rather bad idea, imho.\n. It's probably should be request for 'pointFillColors to be callback' feature, just like lineColors is right now.\n. Okay, so to ran that, you have phantomjs binary in your path. I managed to do that by running npm install -g phantomjs.\n. No, there's no such thing at the moment. You can suggest a PR to do that. I would assume that would be done over here: https://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/blob/e8d84dca099f2428fcbebcb96f7de60135f717fa/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L113.\n.

Can you please provide options/data to reproduce?\n. @kzar, you did good :smile_cat: . I'm closing this issue for now, but if anyone has a steps to reproduce, we'll reopen it.\n. Can you check whether response is a valid JSON object and being treated as such? Try switching  data: data to data: JSON.parse(data) or accessing single field of data you're getting. \n. Would assume @crollioac answer to be sufficient.\n. Tested and setData() changes the label for Bar, Area, Donut, Line.\nPlease provide steps to reproduce. Otherwise I would assume the issue outdated and close after some time.\n. No it didn't/isn't. But it does need our support to continue working on project, since @oesmith recently called to arms. See Readme.md#contributors-wanted or #291 \n. There were some changes and now there're some people who will be helping out with this project. Stay tuned & remember to help if you can and want this project to thrive.\n. > Not sure how to edit a PR  \nJust add commits to the same branch, it will update PR. Or, in case you want to do single commit, you can use rebase + squash though be sure to squash only your commits, so that you're not trying to rewrite history in original repo.\n. @t3chn0r , only issue is you're trying to update build file, instead of editing source coffee files. Sorry for not telling you earilier, did not see it the first time.\n. I did little search and it seems your changes should go around grid.coffee#L223. In case you're not familiar with coffee script, there's awesome Little book of coffee script. It's nothing hard and be sure to ping me in case you need any help with that.\n. Thanks for pointing that out @thadin. Proof that it works.\n. To be more sure that everything works fine, try creating few testcases in \nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/tree/master/spec/lib/grid and maybe adding an example page for clearer visual result. I'm not an authority here, but these steps will make it more probable and easier to integrate into library.\nNo need to check x is true for boolean variable, but that really depends on your code style.\n. Is it still reproducible or did you just used some workaround?\n. Hello. What kind of legend do you want to have? You can use regular css & html stuff to display legend.\n. Since you didn't specify, what exactly you need, I just put up a bacis sample.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/e97YJ/1/\n. We might consider introducing some sort of callback with color & label being passed as arguments to make it easier to draw legend. @oesmith, what's your opinion on this?\n. Possible reasoning for callback:\n1. When using default colors and thus not having your own reference for the colors being used.\n2. Incapsulation (not relying on options property being available as a property of your chart instance - what if we change the implementation and make options part of a closure?).\n3. Unified API across chart types (right now colors are set through barColors. colors [Donut], lineColors ).\n. Can you please provide a plnkr/jsbin with example of both Area & Line behavior with designated dataset?\n. Thanks for the plunks and explanation.\n\ncontinuousLine is supposed to be false by default \n\nHm, according to source code, its default value is true\nResolution:\n- [ ] Fix the doc\n- [x] Decide whether we want Area to be abrupt and play along with continuousLine option and implement fix.\n- [ ] Have area chart non-contiguous on null values\n. Okay, that's how far I got\nhttp://embed.plnkr.co/uVkyfNWA2kp2mB3lVfYZ/\nChanges to code to achieve above plnkr result are \nhttps://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/commit/47ddf33fa6872b697ce30904ace60b8af445b9d4\n@oesmith I would appreciate your judgement on how to handle this area smooth best.\n.

Please provide a example in any js sandbox, for instance, http://plnkr.co/edit/.\nFrom the way you're describing this, it might be the case of events not being handled correctly (either not propagating or not passing to div needed because of the overlay) - needs a (not)working example.\n. There's currently no built-in solution in Morris, and by what @oesmith  says I'm not sure there will be. \nThese issues are for bug reports, pull requests & feature requests.\nI would consider going to stackoverflow and stating your problem, as it seems to be independent of Morris. You have text file, you need to form JS Object (read: 'parsed JSON') and pass it into Morris chart constructor. Answer @msam1300 gave is a bit flawed, you can check the more proper way to do things in https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/427.\n. Closing as duplicate of #424.\n. (Just for future references: it much more handy to give such examples using Plunker, jsfiddle, jsbin, codepen)\nHere's somehow modified example you provided that kinda works.\nMain points: .on('click') returns not the chart that has setData method. Also, if I recall correctly, Morris 0.4.3 didn't have setData method, it was added later.\n\n@oesmith there came up to be a possible issue: if you init your donut with no data, it would not set @raphael for donut and, as result, will fail at #redraw which is called whenever #setData is called. \nPossible solutions:\n1) Call redraw only if any data was there to start with\n2) Still create @raphael when there's no data\n3) wrap it in try .. catch\n. You can do that using css. That's pretty much what morris.css serves.\n. I would suggest using css pointer-events for this.\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n14.06.2014 3:59 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"osushil\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\nLet's say, on clicking any label on Donut Chart, it will display data on\nDataTable, But if there are many records, the \"Progress Bar\" is displayed\nuntil they are displayed in the DataTable.\nTill the time Progress Bar is showing up, \"Hovering or Clicking\" on the\nDonut Chart should not happen.

You actually modified the output js file. Change should go into Morris.Donut source. \nFor anyone interested I created fiddle with proposed changes, you can play with it over here.\nIn my project, when I needed similar functionality, I implemented startAngle, to be able to set point from which donut would start drawing, don't know, whether it would make sense to make it 0-1 mapping to 0-2\u03c0.\nBTW, if you don't really care about inner labels being straight, you can use css transform.\n. I would object to that, given both coffeescript & Raphael has it as goal to support IE8 and I myself had this as a factor when sticking with Morris for my project.\n. Please, be sure to check out development section of readme to come up with awesome pull requests :sun_with_face: \n. Please, provide plnkr/jsbin with code, that seems not to work\n. Please, use http://plnkr.co/edit/ and provide an example of yours, that wouldn't work in chrome, but would work in firefox.\n. Please, see https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvwa for sample usage. Only issue is that hidden divs don't have width, so any time you open tab you should redraw chart in it. \n. Sorry, there was a typo, here's the correct link: https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvw. There was a jsbin with another solution in related issue (search for bootstrap over issues in this repos), but it's 404d me just now.\n. Please, provide a (un)working example using some online sandbox, like plnkr or jsbin/jsfiddle/codepen. Code speaks better than words :smile_cat: \n. Good call! Will be taking a look at this.\n. It's in this repo in gh-pages branch. Probably, here.\n. Can you please link to jsbin with compiled version of updated library? Just wanted to take a quick peek.\n. The issue with build was due to bower failure. Fixed via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/72596faa6f5b59031084b90b0f69232f31a97d55\n. Great work on this one! Can you please rebase against current master? There's an issue with bower https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1403 -> updated the version, let's see what Travis thinks about these.\n. Can you please provide a sandbox demo of this one? I would love to merge all of PRs as soon as I get some time on my hands. \n. There seem to be an issue with hover tests https://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js/jobs/29845066#L1210-L1299 :worried: \n. > What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning?\nI think @oesmith could clarify this for us.\nDemo looks good to me, maybe, should just account for new values in the test.\n. :clap: awesome\n. :+1: Did the same for my working project.\n. You can use use barColors callback to do return some special color for negative values and something else for other colors. See  https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L190-L195 for implementation details.\n. yep\n. Can you please edit the source coffee file instead of resulting js one?\n. I can tell there's odd change in gruntfile. As to API I would suggest adding classFor callback\n. There's none, just a suggestion to what this feature might look like: classFor callback in  your options.\n. :+1:  Good job! Thank you for putting your time & efforts into this library.\n. Just deregister handler with $.fn.off for given selector, maybe?\n. Coming back to this PR have few questions:\n1) @oesmith , are you objecting including this Pie-Componennt into core library at all?\n2) @tiraeth, since Morris is rather straightforward, why not implement this as a plugin/component? I did it like this for my build and with few patches it works like a charm.\nOn this matter, too: we should have just a set of common methods, like setData/render etc (this should be laid out somewhere) and anybody will be able to contribute his/her plugin for Morris. I would love to be able to use heatmaps, if needed, without need to switch to some other library.\n. So, there're several implementation PRs for Pie Charts in this repo, namely https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/92, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/149, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/128.\nI did use #149, though it had some issues (I commented on PR) and the main flaw is - single label visible at the time, which kind of spoils whole point of pie chart, IMO.\nShould we kick off this discussion? Maybe, this should not be included as part of v0.5 release.\n. > ember charts - pie seems promising.\n\n@mkramchandra are you talking about this one? \n. If I understand correctly, this question is outdated. See main page for example.\n. It's in. It was implemented via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/b192a00d685ebe4275ba6c00c1c98aa13a0975e2\n. Guys, be sure to see #340. There might be no updates if you don't contribute back. :crying_cat_face: \n. The X label is kinda trivial, because you can append it and position at your chart element with regualr css. \nPure css Y-axis is a bit trickier. Need to test out this approach which should work in IE above version 7. Some additional logic should be applied for label truncating though.\nThe svg Y-label is rather straightforward and PR for that is https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/299.\n. Looks neat and might be really useful. As well might lay ground for vertical bar charts.\n. Hey, @R-osey, is it still reproducible?\n. There're some projects that're working towards this goal.\nI tried canvg on view of morris examples and it worked quite decent, so might want to use that if you need client side turning into canvas -> img and cannot use server side rendering.\n. There's also https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/321, which shows how to add AMD support on top of browserify, also. @oesmith do you want wrapper to be added as part of build step, or for it to be present in actual source code?\n. Hey, @wojons, thanks for feedback. \nThe issue is, that svgs are generally slower than canvases. Take a look at this SO answer. So we might in the future try to make Morris faster, but that's not an issue for most part at current moment.\n. I assume newer issue should be opened or #346 used. Nevertheless, PRs are welcome in case you still want to contribute :smile_cat: \n. You can use setData() method to change data for element & force redraw.\n. Okay, so main culprit here is probably, this line\nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.grid.coffee#L182\nThe question arise: should callback arity be changed or should we modify options.data as well as data?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/221\n. Consider consulting related issue https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/349.\n. There's no such thing yet,\nThough, you can add\nlast = @options.startPoint || 0 instead of this line\nAnd in your options for chart set\nstartPoint: - Math.PI so that it will start at 12 am.\n. Try using toUTCString()\nnew Date('2013-06-03T22:27:48Z').toUTCString()  // -> \"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 22:27:48 GMT\"\nThe issue here new Date uses your time zone when formatting date, thus the issue. Other possible solution - manually constructing date string, usting getDay(), getFullYear(), getMonth(), getUTCHours(), getUTCMinutes().\n. Please provide plunker or data you set to achieve such result.\n. Hello Daniel, \nit seems to be an issue of rescaling your grid after data update. New scale forces bottom grid line to be not visible.\nAs a temporary solution, you can set padding for your chart.\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/2145/\n. I assume @heruan vocalized this more clearly at https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/322 so will be closing this one for time being.\n. On the failing CI thing: it should install grunt-cli globally now, should I hook it into npm preinstall?\n. There's no bootstrap 3 specific examples in this repo, but there're some in the wild.\n. You can do it like this.\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. For cdn.oesmith.co.uk to serve library when used with https:// a proper SSL certificate is needed, which needs some financing. Why don't use one from cdnjs?\nIt can be found here: //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.4.2/morris.min.js\n. For this purpose I'm using plain \n$(window).on('resize', function() { redoTheChartFunction();});\nWorks like a charm, since Morris is all about percentage and calculating sizes dynamically.\nAnd you might consider using something like (underscore's debounce)[http://underscorejs.org/#debounce] so that you aren't repainting in vain.\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. Sorry, but you edited the resulting js and not the source coffee code. Would also love to see plnkr/jsbin with functionality demo.\n. Will work on this as soon as I get some time on my hands. Thanks for feedback. Should I also add example page?\n. Update PR. Will be doing an example for this one as separate PR.\n. In fact. @oesmith, I would love to become a contributor, even if my only help will be with sorting/labeling issues, reviewing PRs, etc. I do understand your position on keeping Morris clean and simple so I wouldn't be pushy around new feature (like #149) though I'd really like to see that and I do value efforts you and others spent to make Morris what it is.\n. Updated PR. Please review.\n. Pull#300 :bowtie: (even if it's not accepted, it's still number Three-Ouh-Ouh)\n. There came to be couple of issues:\n1) fixed labels to be separated for series, never update PR\n2) Issue with two thin bars side by side - their labels would overlap (same is true for highcharts, btw).\n. I will probably update this, when I figure out how to write some tests. Any ideas on that how to approach that?\n. Same probably goes for label calback, it should be properly executed along the color change.\n. Assume duplicate of #111 \n. Please specify type of chart and the part of chart you're talkign about. Plnkr/jsbin would be perfect.\n. I consider this one good to have and not very hard to implement. :+1: \n. > I would be interested in having the possibility to specify the colors of some dots in my line chart.  \nWhy not use lineColors callback to have something along the lines of\n...\nlineColors: function(row, sidx, type) {\n return row.src.color;\n}\n...\nin your options after you've added colors to data rows?\nP.S. messing with resulting js instead of recompiling from source probably - rather bad idea, imho.\n. It's probably should be request for 'pointFillColors to be callback' feature, just like lineColors is right now.\n. Okay, so to ran that, you have phantomjs binary in your path. I managed to do that by running npm install -g phantomjs.\n. No, there's no such thing at the moment. You can suggest a PR to do that. I would assume that would be done over here: https://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/blob/e8d84dca099f2428fcbebcb96f7de60135f717fa/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L113.\n. Nice one.\nTravis CI failing is odd, tests run smoothly on localhost. \nIt somehow managed to run task in wrong order, might do something with grunt & grunt-cli versioning, which isn't hard-set.\nRunning \"concat:wrap\" (concat) task\nFile \"morris.js\" created.\nRunning \"coffee:lib\" (coffee) task\nFile morris-bare.js created.\nI'd personally, for the naming, would prefer regular morris.js & morris-amd.js, probably.\n. Can you please provide options/data to reproduce?\n. @kzar, you did good :smile_cat: . I'm closing this issue for now, but if anyone has a steps to reproduce, we'll reopen it.\n. Can you check whether response is a valid JSON object and being treated as such? Try switching  data: data to data: JSON.parse(data) or accessing single field of data you're getting. \n. Would assume @crollioac answer to be sufficient.\n. Tested and setData() changes the label for Bar, Area, Donut, Line.\nPlease provide steps to reproduce. Otherwise I would assume the issue outdated and close after some time.\n. No it didn't/isn't. But it does need our support to continue working on project, since @oesmith recently called to arms. See Readme.md#contributors-wanted or #291 \n. There were some changes and now there're some people who will be helping out with this project. Stay tuned & remember to help if you can and want this project to thrive.\n. > Not sure how to edit a PR  \nJust add commits to the same branch, it will update PR. Or, in case you want to do single commit, you can use rebase + squash though be sure to squash only your commits, so that you're not trying to rewrite history in original repo.\n. @t3chn0r , only issue is you're trying to update build file, instead of editing source coffee files. Sorry for not telling you earilier, did not see it the first time.\n. I did little search and it seems your changes should go around grid.coffee#L223. In case you're not familiar with coffee script, there's awesome Little book of coffee script. It's nothing hard and be sure to ping me in case you need any help with that.\n. Thanks for pointing that out @thadin. Proof that it works.\n. To be more sure that everything works fine, try creating few testcases in \nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/tree/master/spec/lib/grid and maybe adding an example page for clearer visual result. I'm not an authority here, but these steps will make it more probable and easier to integrate into library.\nNo need to check x is true for boolean variable, but that really depends on your code style.\n. Is it still reproducible or did you just used some workaround?\n. Hello. What kind of legend do you want to have? You can use regular css & html stuff to display legend.\n. Since you didn't specify, what exactly you need, I just put up a bacis sample.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/e97YJ/1/\n. We might consider introducing some sort of callback with color & label being passed as arguments to make it easier to draw legend. @oesmith, what's your opinion on this?\n. Possible reasoning for callback:\n1. When using default colors and thus not having your own reference for the colors being used.\n2. Incapsulation (not relying on options property being available as a property of your chart instance - what if we change the implementation and make options part of a closure?).\n3. Unified API across chart types (right now colors are set through barColors. colors [Donut], lineColors ).\n. Can you please provide a plnkr/jsbin with example of both Area & Line behavior with designated dataset?\n. Thanks for the plunks and explanation.\n\ncontinuousLine is supposed to be false by default \n\nHm, according to source code, its default value is true\nResolution:\n- [ ] Fix the doc\n- [x] Decide whether we want Area to be abrupt and play along with continuousLine option and implement fix.\n- [ ] Have area chart non-contiguous on null values\n. Okay, that's how far I got\nhttp://embed.plnkr.co/uVkyfNWA2kp2mB3lVfYZ/\nChanges to code to achieve above plnkr result are \nhttps://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/commit/47ddf33fa6872b697ce30904ace60b8af445b9d4\n@oesmith I would appreciate your judgement on how to handle this area smooth best.\n. Can you pleas provide jsbin/plnkr or at least dataset you're using? That will safe some time to reproduce the issue.\n.

You can trigger resize or call redraw\nmethod, to force that behavior, whenever your layout changes.\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n16.05.2014 1:55 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"gudh\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\nFirst of all, thanks for building this beautiful charts.\nCharts do redraw themselves when window width changes. But nothing happens\nwhen I just change the container width (window width stay the same)\nE.g. when user click to hide the vertical sidebar on left, then the width\nenlarges, but morris charts fail to redraw themselves.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/411\n.\n. Can you provide an sample with behaviour you're seeing on plnkr/jsfiddle/jsbin?\n. Would close this in favor of #366 \n. There's no such thing at the time being. :crying_cat_face: \n. Please provide a example in any js sandbox, for instance, http://plnkr.co/edit/.\nFrom the way you're describing this, it might be the case of events not being handled correctly (either not propagating or not passing to div needed because of the overlay) - needs a (not)working example.\n. There's currently no built-in solution in Morris, and by what @oesmith  says I'm not sure there will be. \nThese issues are for bug reports, pull requests & feature requests.\nI would consider going to stackoverflow and stating your problem, as it seems to be independent of Morris. You have text file, you need to form JS Object (read: 'parsed JSON') and pass it into Morris chart constructor. Answer @msam1300 gave is a bit flawed, you can check the more proper way to do things in https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/427.\n. Closing as duplicate of #424.\n. (Just for future references: it much more handy to give such examples using Plunker, jsfiddle, jsbin, codepen)\nHere's somehow modified example you provided that kinda works.\nMain points: .on('click') returns not the chart that has setData method. Also, if I recall correctly, Morris 0.4.3 didn't have setData method, it was added later.\n\n@oesmith there came up to be a possible issue: if you init your donut with no data, it would not set @raphael for donut and, as result, will fail at #redraw which is called whenever #setData is called. \nPossible solutions:\n1) Call redraw only if any data was there to start with\n2) Still create @raphael when there's no data\n3) wrap it in try .. catch\n. You can do that using css. That's pretty much what morris.css serves.\n. I would suggest using css pointer-events for this.\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n14.06.2014 3:59 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"osushil\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\nLet's say, on clicking any label on Donut Chart, it will display data on\nDataTable, But if there are many records, the \"Progress Bar\" is displayed\nuntil they are displayed in the DataTable.\nTill the time Progress Bar is showing up, \"Hovering or Clicking\" on the\nDonut Chart should not happen. Thus, till that time, I want to disable\nMouse Movements on the Chart\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/429#issuecomment-46074085.\n. You actually modified the output js file. Change should go into Morris.Donut source. \nFor anyone interested I created fiddle with proposed changes, you can play with it over here.\nIn my project, when I needed similar functionality, I implemented startAngle, to be able to set point from which donut would start drawing, don't know, whether it would make sense to make it 0-1 mapping to 0-2\u03c0.\nBTW, if you don't really care about inner labels being straight, you can use css transform.\n. I would object to that, given both coffeescript & Raphael has it as goal to support IE8 and I myself had this as a factor when sticking with Morris for my project.\n. Please, be sure to check out development section of readme to come up with awesome pull requests :sun_with_face: \n. Please, provide plnkr/jsbin with code, that seems not to work\n. Please, use http://plnkr.co/edit/ and provide an example of yours, that wouldn't work in chrome, but would work in firefox.\n. Please, see https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvwa for sample usage. Only issue is that hidden divs don't have width, so any time you open tab you should redraw chart in it. \n. Sorry, there was a typo, here's the correct link: https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvw. There was a jsbin with another solution in related issue (search for bootstrap over issues in this repos), but it's 404d me just now.\n. Please, provide a (un)working example using some online sandbox, like plnkr or jsbin/jsfiddle/codepen. Code speaks better than words :smile_cat: \n. Good call! Will be taking a look at this.\n. It's in this repo in gh-pages branch. Probably, here.\n. Can you please link to jsbin with compiled version of updated library? Just wanted to take a quick peek.\n. The issue with build was due to bower failure. Fixed via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/72596faa6f5b59031084b90b0f69232f31a97d55\n. Great work on this one! Can you please rebase against current master? There's an issue with bower https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1403 -> updated the version, let's see what Travis thinks about these.\n. Can you please provide a sandbox demo of this one? I would love to merge all of PRs as soon as I get some time on my hands. \n. There seem to be an issue with hover tests https://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js/jobs/29845066#L1210-L1299 :worried: \n. > What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning?\nI think @oesmith could clarify this for us.\nDemo looks good to me, maybe, should just account for new values in the test.\n. :clap: awesome\n. :+1: Did the same for my working project.\n. You can use use barColors callback to do return some special color for negative values and something else for other colors. See  https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L190-L195 for implementation details.\n. yep\n. Can you please edit the source coffee file instead of resulting js one?\n. I can tell there's odd change in gruntfile. As to API I would suggest adding classFor callback\n. There's none, just a suggestion to what this feature might look like: classFor callback in  your options.\n. :+1:  Good job! Thank you for putting your time & efforts into this library.\n. \n",

I did the following, I don't know Coffee script so if you are OK with the changes maybe you or someone else can add the changes to the script:\nFirst of all I created a new parameter named \"onlyIntegers\" defaulting to \"false\" to maintain compatibility, so the list of variables now look something like this:\n...\nnumLines: 5,\nonlyIntegers: false,\npadding: 25,\n...\nThen around line 257 after the ymax value is calculated I added the following lines:\n```\n...\nif ( this.options.onlyIntegers ) {\n    this.options.numLines = Math.min( this.ymax + 1, this.options.numLines );\n}\nif (this.options.axes === true || this.options.grid === true) {\n...\n```\nThat small piece of code adjust the number of lines in the grid according to the max value of Y. I have tested these changes with all my graphs and everything is working perfectly now.\nNot sure if that change might break something else or not (in the case ymax is not set to auto maybe), I guess you will have a better idea.\nRegards,\nt3chn0r\n. Something like this perhaps?\njavascript\nyLabelFormat: function (y) {\n    var parts = y.toString().split(\".\");\n    parts[0] = parts[0].replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \".\");\n    return parts.join(\",\");\n}\n. I left displaying of a normal date as adding 2013 W5 would apply only to English... I'll see if I can change it to that...\nNot sure what you mean with specs...\n. Any idea where I have to go to edit the PR? I'm new to Github...\n. I really have no idea what I need to do... I'm trying to find an option to edit these changes without creating a new PR but I can't find any option. I guess I will close this one and create a new one.\n. By the way, this is the code I'm using now to display \"2013 W5\", although I don't know Coffee script so I have no idea how to translate it to create a new PR:\n```\n        \"week\": {\n            span: 604800000,\n            start: function(d) {\n                return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate());\n            },\n            fmt: function(d) {\n                var thisWeek = new Date( d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate() );\n                var thisWeekStarts = thisWeek.getTime() + ( 1 - thisWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n                var firstWeek = new Date( d.getFullYear(), 0, 1 );\n                var firstWeekStarts = firstWeek.getTime() + ( 1 - firstWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n                var weekNumber = Math.ceil( ( ( ( thisWeekStarts - firstWeekStarts ) / 86400000 ) ) / 7 );\n            return \"\" + ( d.getFullYear() ) + \" W\" + weekNumber;\n        },\n        incr: function(d) {\n            return d.setDate(d.getDate() + 7);\n        }\n    },\n\n```\n. After doing some more extensive tests I did the following:\nI added getWeek() to Date.prototype:\n```\nDate.prototype.getWeek = function() {\n    var thisWeek = new Date( this.getFullYear(), this.getMonth(), this.getDate(), 0, 0, 0 );\n    var thisWeekStarts = thisWeek.getTime() + ( thisWeek.getDay() == 0 ? -6 : 1 - thisWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n    var firstWeek = new Date( this.getFullYear(), 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 );\n    var firstWeekStarts = firstWeek.getTime() + ( firstWeek.getDay() == 0 ? -6 : 1 - firstWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n    var weekNumber = Math.ceil( ( ( ( thisWeekStarts - firstWeekStarts ) / 86400000 ) ) / 7 );\nreturn ( weekNumber ) ? weekNumber : 52;\n\n}\n```\nThe format function for week in Morris should look like this:\nfmt: function(d) {\n                var week = d.getWeek();\n                var year = ( week == 52 && d.getMonth() == 0 ) ? d.getFullYear() - 1 : d.getFullYear();\n                return \"\" + year + \" W\" + week;\n            },\nLike I said before I don't know Coffee script so I can't create a PR to implement this... Sorry about that.\n. Yeah, that's why I don't think this PR makes any sense... It's something that I needed for my project and I just wanted to share it but probably there's a better and clearner way to implement it in Morris.\n. Check the examples, there's one named \"events.html\" that shows what you are looking for if I understood correctly.\n. :+1: \n. Hello @oesmith, any update on this one? Regards\n. Hello @sudodoki, I will take a shot at implementing this then and see how it goes... I will take a look at it tomorrow and ask people to test it.\n. Please have a look at PR #341...

Was having the same issue, thanks for the workaround, at least it's working now until a more definitive solution is implemented. :+1: \n. Not sure how to edit a PR...

I thought you'd ask that!\nI just tried to and WAS able to get chrome to hang.\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/3/\nI haven't used jsbin before- but it seems that if you edit anything it re-renders the iframe.\nI was able to get chrome to hang very easily by modifying the \"width\" of the \"chart\" div in the html pane.\n. Try this link - you need to be in edit mode;\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/4/edit\nWatch the console while it renders the iframe.  It should print \"finished\" after drawing the chart.\nEventually for me, it hangs and never reaches that point.  Then I have to kill the whole tab in chrome.\n. Hm - like I said in earlier comment - sometimes during the \"freeze\" the console was actually spewing errors from within the Raphael js code - stuck in an infinite loop of some kind...  \nI think the line in the morris code was this:\nline 384 i believe\n          _results.push(this.drawGridLine(\"M\" + this.left + \",\" + y + \"H\" + (this.left + this.width)));\nI think thats where the H1810 came from in the \"Error parsing\" exception / stacktrace.\nIf this were a Chrome rendering issue, I don't think I would have gotten the \"looping\" symptom.\nAlso in my experience Chrome usually DOES kill the tab with \"Aw, Snap\".\n. Doing some debugging:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/18/edit\nGot it to hang after \"debug 11\" - seems to be triggered by reducing the width of the chart div (eg: 33px).\nSo the freeze is occuring in:\nthis.drawXAxis();  (Line.prototype)\n. Found the stuck loop!\ntry this: http://jsbin.com/ugavuz/24/edit\nReduce the width to 33px (instead of 331px).\nMy console is spewing:  debug dx-loop:\nIn normal / successful completion, this loop should only be 17 iterations.\n. Looks like labelSeries is returning 1.5 million labels instead of 17.  Must be triggered by a width too small.\n---debug dx6b: 1533601 \n. So in labelSeries:\nconsole.log(\"==ls: \"+dmin+\" \"+dmax+\" \"+pxwidth);\noutput:\n==ls: 1366434000000 1367967600000 -1\nLooks like it is getting a negative value for pxwidth - probably due to the narrow width (33px) and my declared padding of 10px.\nThis results in the endless loop in labelSeries.\nNow I'm not sure this is the cause of the issue in my app, since I am NOT using a narrow width - my width is more like 1800px.  So I will play around with some debugging there and report back.\n. Also here is the latest jsbin showing the 1.5 million labels returned:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/25/edit\nThis one actually wont hang the browser because I added a safety break out in the next loop.\n. The hang in my app is occurring in labelSeries but NOT due to negative pxwidth!\nAnalyzing now...\n. Thanks - so here is output from my app in the labelSeries loop, building the ret array.\nFirst value is \"t\" and second value is size of ret[].\nThe length SHOULD be 61 on successful loop.\nNotice that on iteration #59, t has NOT increased!

Also - i was previously using v 0.3.3 but I just upgraded to 0.4.1 to see if the issue would go away.\nUsing raphael v 2.1.0\n. I thought you'd ask that!\nI just tried to and WAS able to get chrome to hang.\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/3/\nI haven't used jsbin before- but it seems that if you edit anything it re-renders the iframe.\nI was able to get chrome to hang very easily by modifying the \"width\" of the \"chart\" div in the html pane.\n. Try this link - you need to be in edit mode;\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/4/edit\nWatch the console while it renders the iframe.  It should print \"finished\" after drawing the chart.\nEventually for me, it hangs and never reaches that point.  Then I have to kill the whole tab in chrome.\n. Hm - like I said in earlier comment - sometimes during the \"freeze\" the console was actually spewing errors from within the Raphael js code - stuck in an infinite loop of some kind...  \nI think the line in the morris code was this:\nline 384 i believe\n          _results.push(this.drawGridLine(\"M\" + this.left + \",\" + y + \"H\" + (this.left + this.width)));\nI think thats where the H1810 came from in the \"Error parsing\" exception / stacktrace.\nIf this were a Chrome rendering issue, I don't think I would have gotten the \"looping\" symptom.\nAlso in my experience Chrome usually DOES kill the tab with \"Aw, Snap\".\n. Doing some debugging:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/18/edit\nGot it to hang after \"debug 11\" - seems to be triggered by reducing the width of the chart div (eg: 33px).\nSo the freeze is occuring in:\nthis.drawXAxis();  (Line.prototype)\n. Found the stuck loop!\ntry this: http://jsbin.com/ugavuz/24/edit\nReduce the width to 33px (instead of 331px).\nMy console is spewing:  debug dx-loop:\nIn normal / successful completion, this loop should only be 17 iterations.\n. Looks like labelSeries is returning 1.5 million labels instead of 17.  Must be triggered by a width too small.\n---debug dx6b: 1533601 \n. So in labelSeries:\nconsole.log(\"==ls: \"+dmin+\" \"+dmax+\" \"+pxwidth);\noutput:\n==ls: 1366434000000 1367967600000 -1\nLooks like it is getting a negative value for pxwidth - probably due to the narrow width (33px) and my declared padding of 10px.\nThis results in the endless loop in labelSeries.\nNow I'm not sure this is the cause of the issue in my app, since I am NOT using a narrow width - my width is more like 1800px.  So I will play around with some debugging there and report back.\n. Also here is the latest jsbin showing the 1.5 million labels returned:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/25/edit\nThis one actually wont hang the browser because I added a safety break out in the next loop.\n. The hang in my app is occurring in labelSeries but NOT due to negative pxwidth!\nAnalyzing now...\n. Thanks - so here is output from my app in the labelSeries loop, building the ret array.\nFirst value is \"t\" and second value is size of ret[].\nThe length SHOULD be 61 on successful loop.\nNotice that on iteration #59, t has NOT increased!  So I guess some issue in the \"incrementer\" ?\n===ls loop: 1362870000000 51 \n===ls loop: 1362873600000 52\n===ls loop: 1362877200000 53 \n===ls loop: 1362880800000 54 \n===ls loop: 1362884400000 55 \n===ls loop: 1362888000000 56 \n===ls loop: 1362891600000 57 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 58 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 59 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 60 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 61 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 62 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 63\n. OK guess what...\nthe incrementer breaks down when crossing day light savings time!\nd.setMinutes(d.getMinutes()+60)  - winds up with SAME value\n```\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 55 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 56 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 57 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 58 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 59 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 60 \n```\n. Should probably change to getTime() / setTime() using actual milliseconds for interval.\n. So to summarize - \n1) endless loop due to \"negative\" pxwidth\n2) endless loop due to incrementer failing to cross into DST\n(Both issues occur in labelSeries fn)\n.

I use this for \"Februar 2016\" for example as legend (mouse over popup) so you get an idea....\njavascript\ndateFormat: function (x) {\n            var IndexToMonth = [ \"Januar\", \"Februar\", \"M\u00e4rz\", \"April\", \"Mai\", \"Juni\", \"Juli\", \"August\", \"September\", \"Oktober\", \"November\", \"Dezember\" ];\n            var month = IndexToMonth[ new Date(x).getMonth() ];\n            var year = new Date(x).getFullYear();\n            return month + ' ' + year;\n        },\n.

For each yKeys there are two child path element in SVG element.\nEach path element have fill and stroke attribute and in first path element fill have color value and stroke have none value and in second path element fill have none value and stroke have color value and there are same number of label div with class \".morris-hover-point\" and on each hover the value of these div element will change,  And the color of that label and the graph path element(2nd element) are same.\nSo first I add click event listener to the path element as we have two path element for a single yKeys on first path element click event get triggered and the next path element have the similar color value as the label color value so I retrieve the next path element on click and store the stroke attribute value and then loop through the \".morris-hover-point\" class div and again store the style color value if the label and path stroke value are same then i have log the value of that series(y/z).\n```\n    Morris.Area({\n          element: 'third',\n          data: [\n            {x: '2010 Q4', y: 3, z: 7},\n            {x: '2011 Q1', y: 3, z: 4},\n            {x: '2011 Q2', y: null, z: 1},\n            {x: '2011 Q3', y: 2, z: 5},\n            {x: '2011 Q4', y: 8, z: 2},\n            {x: '2012 Q1', y: 4, z: 4}\n          ],\n          xkey: 'x',\n          ykeys: ['y', 'z'],\n          labels: ['Y', 'Z']\n          }).on('click', function(i, row){\n          // console.log(i, row);\n    });\nfunction getClickedValue(event) {\n    var pathCol  = this.nextSibling.getAttribute(\"stroke\");     \n    $(\".morris-hover-point\").each(function() {       \n        var labStyle = this.getAttribute(\"style\");\n        var labCol = labStyle.slice(labStyle.indexOf(\":\")+1);           \n        if(pathCol.trim().toLowerCase() === labCol.trim().toLowerCase()) {\n            console.log(\"You have Clicked On: \"+this.textContent);\n        }           \n    });     \n}\n$(document).on('click', 'path', getClickedValue);\n\n```\nExplanation - \n`$(document).on('click', 'path', getClickedValue);   `\nI have set click event listener for path element and call the getClickedValue method. \nfunction getClickedValue(event) {\n        var pathCol  = this.nextSibling.getAttribute(\"stroke\");     \n        $(\".morris-hover-point\").each(function() {       \n            var labStyle = this.getAttribute(\"style\");\n            var labCol = labStyle.slice(labStyle.indexOf(\":\")+1);           \n            if(pathCol.trim().toLowerCase() === labCol.trim().toLowerCase()) {\n                console.log(\"You have Clicked On: \"+this.textContent);\n            }           \n        });     \n         }\nTo get the color value of the path element\nvar pathCol  = this.nextSibling.getAttribute(\"stroke\");\nHere this refer to the current path element and this.nextSibling is used to refer the next path element and after that access the stroke attribute.\nNow I process the label div with class \".morris-hover-point\"\n$(\".morris-hover-point\").each(function() {       \n    var labStyle = this.getAttribute(\"style\");\n        var labCol = labStyle.slice(labStyle.indexOf(\":\")+1);           \n        if(pathCol.trim().toLowerCase() === labCol.trim().toLowerCase()) {\n            console.log(\"You have Clicked On: \"+this.textContent);\n        }           \n});\nHere - \nvar labStyle = this.getAttribute(\"style\");\nreturn something like -    color:#2577b5\nBut I need only #2577b5 value to match with the stroke value for that i use - \nvar labCol = labStyle.slice(labStyle.indexOf(\":\")+1);\nand after that finally match the stroke value and the label div color value - \n```\n if(pathCol.trim().toLowerCase() === labCol.trim().toLowerCase()) {\n    console.log(\"You have Clicked On: \"+this.textContent);\n }\n```\nNote - It works well but make sure you have set different colors for the every yKeys.\n\n.
