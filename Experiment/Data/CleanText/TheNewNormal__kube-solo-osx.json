    "rimusz": "fixed in v0.1.4\n. fixed in v0.1.4\n. what exactly happened there?\n. fixed in v0.1.4\n. @stevesloka yes vagrant sucks without network, this is why I made xhyve based one Apps.\nI'm thinking to convert my https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui-kubernetes-cluster one to xhyve too, but xhyve is not so easy dealing with getting IPs. Will start working on it at some time as next week I'm going to San Francisco DevOps days and KubeCon, the Barcelona DockerCon and Distributed Matters. Need to find time for it :)\n. @stevesloka also take a look to https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui which is great to build docker/rkt images and has built in docker registry, so you can use docker images for this App k8s cluster\n. @brendandburns it gets annoying to type the password twice:\n1) to get mac address via uuid\n2) to start VM with xhyve\nas both need sudo\nI'm looking for other solutions to get rid of asking/saving user's password to be used for sudo\n. @brendandburns maybe for the start I can ask at the install part to save or not to save the password and work from there with two different options\n. @brendandburns cool, I got keychain working fine, but a bit stuck on replacing python web server to go based\ngo based web server works fine for my other App, so the strange problem with this App :)\n. @brendandburns fixed with v0.1.8\n. @v1k0d3n  I need more details the steps you did.\nApp uses xhyve which comes with it.\nWhat do you mean about unclear instructions?\n. btw I will a new version soon, which does not save Mac user's password to the disk but saves to Keychain instead\n. Just under \"Setup\" you need to type your Mac user password, maybe that step was not right?\nas \"sudo\" needs to be used twice in the App, get macaddress to uuid and start xhyve\n. @ben I never had issues with DNS before, as I use xhyve for my two Apps. xhyve creates a network bridge on 192.168.64.1so DNS should resolve at no problem there. It might be your Mac network then, try to reboot it.\n. I use xhyve based Apps since xhyve came out, never had issues with DNS, try to stop dnsmasq and see what happens.\nBut I never use docker-machine, maybe the problem is there?\n. @ben told ya :)\n. @interstateone nice one, thanks\n. @gedw99 this is purely done for local kubernetes manifests as rc, services and etc testing.\nYou can point your kubectl to GCE cluster when you have tested locally and create kubernetes services in the cloud then.\n. oh my ..., big refactoring is done there :)\nI do not want to merge to the master yet, as I have travel a lot for the next few weeks, so do not want to break the App which I want to use for demos :) But would be nice to get merged at some point next month and reuse for my other Apps too :)\nNoticed a few errors in \n\n. also, are you good in converting to swift? that help also would be good :)\n. I tried to compile your repo master brach and got that error.\nAwesome regarding the Swift :)\nI have two Apps based on xhyve, both I would love to both to get refactored :) and convert them to Swift later. Then I can take one as a base and move my other Apps to xhyve & Swift :)\n. phew, finished with my conferences\nI have made some good improvements to the App, can you please rebase your changes against the latest master branch.\n. awesome job, thanks man\nI will merge it, then I need to do some refactoring of shells scripts :)\nWould you mind to do the same refactoring for my other xhyve based App https://github.com/TheNewNormal/coreos-osx please.\nThen we can move on to swift.\nWhen we have kube-solo ported to swift I can start working on https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-cluster-osx, xhyve based k8s cluster with master+ 2 nodes\n. @interstateone sure, not a big deal, you already have done an outstanding job :)\nI will use as a base kube-solo App for my future Apps, and will try to find some time to convert the coreos-osx one myself.\n. v0.2.2 will have this functionality \ncc/@v1k0d3n\n. selected stable and beta versions now can be installed \n. @v1k0d3n latest v0.2.6 fully supports of any kubernetes version install\n. sure, I will take a look, it should be possible to implement\n. @rroopreddy does not look that `kube-up.sh' creates any service account, it depends on the examples\nyou are trying to run needs. You need to create some service account e.g.:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: somename\n. Can you please provide an example you are trying to run?\n. right, I do use 10.11.2 myself, need to so how to reproduce it.\nWhat kind of Mac do you have?\n. Also can you check if the root.img is in the ~/kube-solo folder?\n. try to reboot your Mac, as sometimes xhyve cannot start properly \n. xhyve is baked in to corectl tool, try- corectl ps\n. the binary of corectl is in ~/kube-solo/bin folder\ntry to clone corectl repo and run an example from there, might help us to find out why it is the VM is booting for you \n. @julienmarie thanks for your debug information, need to check why it is causing problems on stable channel. \n@AntonioMeireles you use 10.10.xxx, can you try to reproduce the problem?\n. @julienmarie I'm not able to reproduce the VM not booting (VM boots to format the disk and then restarts with another config, which saves on installing mke2fs tools) on stable on 10.11\n. @julienmarie can you the test for me, create and format root.img with mke2fs and label it with ROOT label then try to boot onto stable channel, thanks\n. @julienmarie please try the latest kube-solo v0.4.1, thanks \n. Root disk is not used anymore, so it's formatting should not be a problem \n. interesting issue, as it looks like the ~//kube-solo/kube/kube.tgz file (k8s binaries) does not get copied to VM when it was provisioned.\n@jchauncey can you show me the output when you the provision the fresh VM?\nYou should see there like this:\nInstalling Kubernetes files on to VM...\n[corectl] uploading 'kube.tgz' to 'k8solo-01:/home/core/kube.tgz'\n40.49 MB / 40.49 MB [======================================================================] 100.00 %\nDone with k8solo-01\n. it does upload, get the latest v0.4.2 with the fixed upload progress, and can you try beta/stable CoreOS?\n. even using the alpha?\n. sweet, thanks for testing \n. @jchauncey weird one, will try to reproduce it. Can you in mean time try to use another coreos channel e.g. stable and see if it works for you, thanks \n. I have tried all three channels on both Apps kube-solo and coreos-osx, both can ping outside \n. @olalonde which OS X 10.10 or 10.11 you have ?\n. yes, both projects are mine. the kube-solo is based on corect/xhyve so this why it got moved to the new thenewnormal github org, which is for corectltool and Apps based on it. I'm porting coreos-osx-kubernetes-cluster to corect/xhyve as well, so that project in future will removed to thenewnormal github org\n. no, it looks like you are having a problem with settings file and this is why the VM does not boot for you.\nCan you post the ~/kube-solo/settings/k8solo-01.toml content, please. thanks \n. @drcamp hmm, in your settings file there should be only one sshkey =..., as having more gives the error. Which App version are you using?\n. @zeroem you settings file looks fine, for some reason VM does not boot.\nWhich App version are you using?\n. @drcamp can you try new v0.4.7 version, please?\n. sudo is not needed there if you follow the right install procedure.\n@AntonioMeireles can we get your input here?\n. cool, can we close this then?\n. awesome \n. @jtblin kube-solo does not use the kubelet which comes with coreos.\nall files required by kubernetes get copied to VM when install is done\nand the ~/kube-solo/kube/kubeconfig has not server IP because the VM was not able to start \n. @esbenp ssh to kube-solo VM and check that the internet is accessible from there\n. @esbenp you have failed docker.service unit there, check it's logs\nand post it here\n. @esbenp can you journalctl -u docker.service -las the messages are cut\n. this is our problem lstat /var/lib/docker/volumes/65a7aad8ad1b612babb001d8cbdbe45775697d3ba5a73942e8740810aa70ef68: input/output error\nThe docker did not get mounted properly, I use ext4 there, will try to switch to btrfs in the next release.\nHeading to the KubeCon today, so will cut a new version next week\n@AntonioMeireles any advice on this problem?\n. guys can you try the latest https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases/tag/v0.6.0 to see if the problem still exists, thanks\n. Latest v0.6.3 addresses those issues\n. I will introduce in the next version of the App more checks and more detailed error messages to know what the problem is.\n. @chrislovecnm already tried to introduce nfsd restart and nfsd update without a luck :(\nwe hope with Antonio to have new version of corectl soon, which will have optional nfs as in most cases it is not needed on kube apps \n. the latest v0.8.0 should fix all these problems\n. I need to think how to use tmux, as I do not want to break App's work for everybody else who do not use tmux\n. this one https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/blob/master/src/up.command gets called the you do Up\n. @wstrange sudo password is needed for corectl/xhyve to boot VMs \n. @AntonioMeireles such message would be really nice to have and then the VM's boot should continue\n. @AntonioMeireles is working on some solution :)\n. @piepkrak NFS is disabled, so should not be the issue anymore\n. @jchauncey there is an option to change the password in Setup\n. @whitlockjc docker registry in CoreOS OSX App is configured to work without https, do not see any point of it for the private local registry.\nI do not include private registry in kube-solo as there is kube-cluster app too, which needs to access to docker registry.\ncoreos app is used to build docker containers and has the private registry docker images to be pushed to, then images can be reused by kube apps.\nIf there is a demand to have a separate docker registry App, I can make it up, but for now nobody else have asked for it.\n. I was thinking how to make better use of private docker registry. One more small I think will be too much to have.\nWhat I'm going to do is separate the coreos VM boot and docker registry start.\nI will add an extra menu options to coreos VM App to start/stop docker registry,\nthat will allow build docker images and push to registry, then stop coreos VM and\nstill able to reuse docker registry from kube Apps\n. docker registry works on CoreOS VM just fine, but just does not use the https, so use http and you will be fine.\nAs mentioned before I do not see any point use https for the local docker registry setup, no needs to complicate things\n. I use registry on CoreOS VM e.g. like this:\n```\n$ docker pull alpine\nUsing default tag: latest\nlatest: Pulling from library/alpine\n2314ad3eeb90: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:d7201bdfa765bebed9a79c385db4378f55593e50dc8d002b9713810320ad93b9\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest\n$ docker tag alpine 192.168.64.1:5000/alpine\n$ docker push 192.168.64.1:5000/alpine\nThe push refers to a repository [192.168.64.1:5000/alpine] (len: 1)\n2314ad3eeb90: Image successfully pushed\nlatest: digest: sha256:dded5fb5deaf6f7b186a84841e76d2340391a202618dd9697688ef4d9a1b2f21 size: 1369\n```\nAs you see it works just fine \n. ah, docker-machine again, this is why I do not use it as I like my default shell to be clean.\nI will release a new version next week with DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY= DOCKER_CERT_PATH= in preset shell.\n. @whitlockjc https://github.com/TheNewNormal/coreos-osx/releases/tag/v1.2.2 automatically presets: \nDOCKER_TLS_VERIFY= \nDOCKER_CERT_PATH=\nPlease check it out and let me know if any issues you have encountered \n. related only for CoreOS VM App\n. yup, it does do that to ignore your ~/.kube/config and then kubectl can connect to kube-solo master correctly \n. @whitlockjc as I have mentioned above kube-solo does not touch your /.kube/config, when you open Preset OS Shell via App then $HOME/kube-solo/kube/kubeconfig is used. If you open another shell window not via App then your kubectl will look to /.kube/config. As in that way you can work with two k8s clusters at once.\n. @mbrevoort first able the Virtual Box is not needed for this App to function.\nAnd you cannot run the App directly from the dmg file, you  need to drag the App to your Desktop or Applications folder and run from there.\n. @mbrevoort latest App version v0.5.3 does not allow to start the from the DMG, it should be fix your problem \n. @mbrevoort your network setup just was messed up, maybe by virtualbox, rebooting should sort you out.\n@AntonioMeireles is any way why we can check with corectl it and reset the network ?\n. @puja108 yup, that's really annoying, but as my use case does not need any vbox/vagrant based setups\nI do not encounter such problems. I hope docker opens their Docker for Mac code, so we can reuse their fixes they have done for the xhyve.\n. @puja108 I do not want pure @AntonioMeireles to spend time fixing that problem :)\n. @puja108 we already saw that announcement and @AntonioMeireles is going to look more deeply to the fixes done there tomorrow \n. the latest version v0.8.0 should fix all these problems\n.  might be still in downloading of containers process\ncheck with kubectl --namespace=kube-system get po for pod kubernetes-dashboard-v1.0.0\n. @markTward Deis Apps usually are accessed in the case of Kube-Solo via router IP, as there is no LoadBalancer.\ne.g. app_name.kube-solo_ip.xip.io \n. it looks like the coreos image by corectl tool was not properly downloaded, try to delete the iso image in ~/.coreos folder, delete the VM's ~/kube-solofolder and run Up\n. @BrunoBonacci can you report that issue on https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl please, as the problem is related with corectl tool, thanks\n. this problem should be fixed with corectl v0.5.5 which is now included in kube-solo v0.5.9 release\n. @AntonioMeireles ping\n. @BrunoBonacci released https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases/tag/v0.6.0\n. @rodcloutier I see you are using pot 8888 in kubectl run hello --image=192.168.64.1:5000/hello-node:v1 --port 8888 but hello world example uses 8080\n. @AntonioMeireles ping\n. @chrislovecnm NFS is disabled, too many issues with it\n. @chrislovecnm it does have master services and node ones as well\n. I see, any prebuilt version from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases can be installed via 'Updates->Change Kubernetes version'\nSo basically you want to use locally built binaries, hmm it should be possible to automate, just need to find a time for that.\nAs a work around for now you can built binaries, copy OS X kubectl to /kube-solo/kube and update /kube-solo/kube/kube.tgz with your freshly built linux binaries, then via Setup->Destroy Kube-Solo VM and on next  Up the new VM will be created with kubernetes version in kube.tgz file\n. that hack/build-go.sh takes ages on my mac mini to run \n. @chrislovecnm take a look to https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/blob/master/src/functions.sh#L270-L338 and if you have time to hack a new function to build form source the git gist will be very welcome, I will do the rest to include it to the App\n. fixed by #61 \n. @chrislovecnm use $HOME/ instead of ~/\nWhat about the placing the file to ~/kube-solo/tmp/kubernetes.tar.gz and install from there?\n. @chrislovecnm I have changed that you have to copy the file to ~/kube-solo/tmp and it will be installed from there, no option to type the file's path\n. @kvacquier do you have local docker registry running?\n. nope, kube-solo does not have it. but you can use my other app CoreOS VM, with it you can build docker images and it has the local docker registry which is accessible for the kube-solo\n. this not the issue, so I'm closing it\n. need to test it out, to see that it does not break App's functionality \n. @whitlockjc no worries, thanks for the PR, and I'm happy you find the Kube-solo App useful \n. @mboersma can you provide the exact steps, so I can try to reproduce it. thanks\n. @AntonioMeireles ping, any ideas why the corectl could crash after running for 30 min, I'm not able to reproduce it yet.\n. @mboersma please try the latest v0.8.0 it is based on the latest corectl v0.7.x with a separate server daemon and client.\n. awesome\n. @theganyo did your VM start normally? \nYou should not be asked for the password.\n. @theganyo can you do the fresh VM install, something must be went wrong there\n. that's weird one, try to delete the whole app folder, I will look and try to find what could cause this problem\n. @theganyo can you confirm that this problem is still in the latest App version for you. thanks\nopen the issue if the problem persist.\n. @dmcnaught ssh to VM and check that the Internet is reachable from there\n. so you need to check what's wrong with you Mac networking then, try just simple reboot first\n. so something is still not right there, as the App uses xhyve based setup and network there is just a bridge.\n. no, it comes with the App as corectl tool, which is a wrapper around xhyve and made to control CoreOS VMs on Mac.\n. check https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl tool and the user-data is in ~/kube-solo/cloud-init\n. Internet check is in place in the lasted App version, the error message will pop up if internet is not accessible.\nI'm closing this one, as this issue is not really related to the App\n. @the-destro can you elaborate your problem?\n. try to use nip.io e.g. 192.168.64.2.nip.io on your phone\n. ping @AntonioMeireles \n. @AntonioMeireles any ideas on this one?\n. I'm not really a man in this case, @AntonioMeireles is, but was too busy recently to look to it.\nin TheNewNormal org all projects are our side/free time projects and we do not get much community help there, so sometimes it is hard to keep up.\n. ah, nice, keep me posted how it goes\n. @huggsboson we are going to make NFS as an optional very soon, that should make easier to use corectl based apps then\nhttps://github.com/TheNewNormal/coreos-osx/issues/76\n. dupe of #30 \n. currently k8s starts via fleet units which allows easily make changes redeploy the changed unit.\nwe can try option 1).\nnever used authn/authz  before, can you provide the kube master settings needed for the change, so i will look how to implement it\nthanks\n. @whitlockjc fleet might be gone from the next version, just do the systemd unit and add it to cloud-init file\n. @whitlockjc the latest version v0.8.7 has no fleet anymore, so update user-data file\n. @whitlockjc update the kube-apiserver.service in fleet folder, then it that folder run ' fleetctl destroy kube-apiserver.service && fleetctl start kube-apiserver.serrvice' and the kube-apiserver will redeployed\n. @whitlockjc corectl.app v0.2.1 works on macOS 10.10, so you can use it with the latest kube-solo v0.8.7. So update the cloud-init there to check authn/authz\n. no worries @whitlockjc \njust edit the kube-solo/cloud-init/user-data file and then halt and up, that's it.\nCan authn/authz stuff be enabled all the time and not used?\n. ok, then just drop your updated user-data file and instructions how to use to me by email, so if there are such needs I have it. :)\nthanks\n. awesome, thanks\n. too much hassle to implement as testing needs to be done for add-ons \n. implemented in v0.8.3\n. fixed\n. @cobrowserAlex kube-ui was replaced by kubernetes-dashboard a while ago already\n. yes, that's is correct, we had way too many problems with NFS.\nI'm going to make it optional in the next release.\n. here we go:\n```\n$ corectl ssh -h\nAttach to or run commands inside a running CoreOS instance\nUsage:\n    corectl ssh VMid [\"command1;...\"] [flags]\nAliases:\nssh, attach\nExamples:\n  corectl ssh VMid                 // logins into VMid\n  corectl ssh VMid \"some commands\" // runs 'some commands' inside VMid and exits\n``\n. the VM's name isk8solo-01. @cobrowserAlex here we go\n![NFS option](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215395/16741037/7b72e82e-4799-11e6-8ca5-ed6e2b4e71db.png)\n. @cobrowserAlex I just ported the code from coreos-vm app :)\nIt was in my plans anyway\nSo I think we can close this one\n. known issue it should be fix in the new Deis Workflow v2.2 release https://github.com/deis/builder/pull/382\n. let's keep it open, so other users can notice the issue\n. the new Deis Workflow v2.2.0 works fine now, so closing the issue\n. @kloudstudio can you explain your steps how got the error in more details, so I can reproduce the problem?\nthanks\n. @kloudstudio ok, I see that, thanks\nBy intentioncorectlfiles are put to/usr/local/sbinso that does not interfere  withcorectlfiles installed in other folders.\nbtw kube apps should only be used withcorectl.app` allow users (not hacky ones) to simplify Apps use.\nIf you want to use in your way, that's fine too, but I do not see this as the issue, so closing this one.\n. @kloudstudio I think I know what happened corectl.app \nAt the start it check that is the first install and opened a new terminal window to save your sudo and continued to start all processes but as the sudo password was not available yet, so corectl files had no chance to be copied to inexistent folder.\nWorking on that corner case.\n. @Tpbrown could you please update first-init.command and up.command as well?\nand test that the change works everywhere as I do not use fish stuff myself :)\n. Closing this one, as it was conflicting with my changes, but I have cherry picked your changes and implemented. Thanks for it :)\n. The corectl.app was made intentionally to avoid brew install corectl stuff. As there are three Apps depending on corectld having a dedicated corectl.app makes more sense.\nPlus we do not want people to force and install brew as not everybody is using it.\nAlso corectl.app has the option via menu Check for corectld updates which downloads the latest version of corectl tools so you do not have visit releases page and downloading and installing manually. \nThe visit releases page and downloading and installing only applies for corectl.app itself.\n. Sorry cannot accept this PR, as that will conflict will corectl.app features and our future plans to merge corectl.app and corectl into one project when we are ready to do delta updates.\nBut anyway thanks for your effort :)\n. you just can sym link /usr/local/bin/corectl to /usr/local/sbin/corectl and use brew installed corectl then\n. this is more question to @AntonioMeireles who is the wizard behind corectl tool used for the apps virtualisation \n. just use nfs volume /Users/my_user:/Users/my_user\n. those f..k Gremlins are always the problem :) \n. hmm, this is something todo with corectl.app, as it copies it's files to ~/bin folder.\nkube-solo app does not have those files by itself anymore\n. phew\n. sure, have that in my plans already, will do it next week\n. v0.9.3 got the cancel option\n. loadbalancer/external IP is cloud provider feature, it will only work with GCP, AWS and Azure. \n. it is nothing to do with the Kubernetes or this VM :)\n. yes, after app install you can use cli to control VM, as per readme:\nAfter successful install you can control kube-solo VM via ksolo cli as well. Cli resides in ~/kube-solo/bin and ~/bin foldersand has simple commands: ksolo start|stop|status|ip|ssh, just add ~/bin to your pre-set path.\n. we usually hang out at kubernetes slack\n. we can close this one, as it answered your question :)\n. sorry it is not me who does homebrew formula or nether anybody from our team. must be some other person does it time by time. so i'm closing this one\n. I used to have the iTerm as a requirement, but guys always forgot to install it and always there an issue opened that app does not work, so I included it with the app, so no needs to install by yourself. Most of user and myself found iTerm more user friendly comparing to Terminal.\nSure I will update docs that iTerm is needed, if not found it will be installed for you.\nPR is welcome to support both :)\n. readme updated \n. ups, forgot that all rcs were moved to deployments. \nI will update the install script with that\n. fixed in https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases/tag/v0.9.7\n. fixed in https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases/tag/v0.9.7\n. @AntonioMeireles ^^^\n. hey @seanknox this problem has nothing to do with kube-solo or kube-cluster apps, the problem is with kubectl which is compiled with go v1.6.x, on Sierra go binaries compiled with that go version spit those errors. Only go binaries compiled with go v1.7.x work fine there.\nhttps://medium.com/@gerred/kubectl-1-3-7-for-macos-sierra-ee2c483e283d#.2x4fuh2sj\n. @seanknox yes, that should solve the kubectl problem till we get k8s binaries built with go v1.7.\nI was not able to compile kubectl with go v1.7, as always so many go dependencies there, not really go expert.\n. also I need to update deis_install there (minio), to support latest workflow move from rc to deployments\n. @AntonioMeireles is it possible to add kube-dns Service IP address to /etc/resolve.conf?\nWhat I mean is it possible to add it via cloud config?\n. interesting issue, why the k8solo-01.toml is not there, need to add a check for that file, if not found, copy it from app's bundle.\nCan you try to delete /Users/mike/kube-solo folder and try again, please. thanks\n. interesting, as there is a shell command to create that folder.\nare you using bash, zsh, or other shell?\n. docker for Mac does not make any difference for kube-solo app,\nas corectl tool is based on Docker HypertKit too.\nBooth are using the same native macOS Hypervisor.\nIt looks like something really weird is going on on your mac.\nUsually I try the reboot and see what happens\n. still strange that happens for you only, will try to recheck the k8s initial install part, which was solid for months \n. phew, cool. yes I see that for corectl too, @AntonioMeireles is aware of it (he is corectl maintainer)\n. @mkarliner the kube-solo should not hang on waiting for Kubernetes cluster to be ready , fixed it in #146 \n. also looking to that corectl still doesn't start correctly on boot https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl.app/issues/39\n. sorry, have not updated helm install part yet, as it got changed again in upstream :)\n. fixed in https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases/tag/v0.9.7\n. @olalonde I can you explain the steps you did there, so I can try to reproduce it, thanks\n. added @viglesiasce comments from k8s helm channel:\nin order to work around that could you implement a static route at the OS level to point the service IPs to the vm ip?\nroute -n add 10.212.0.0/24 192.168.64.3\nwhere service ip range is 10.212.0.0/24 \ncould also be done for pod ips\n. @AntonioMeireles ^^^\n. we are already looking to it. this one is blocked by getting host networking vodooo more resilient (all working when vpn tunnels in use). ideal solution would be to consume docker\u2019s vpnkit - mess is that it isn\u2019t clear that it would be multiVM out of the box (as we are a bit more evolved than them)\n. The default Terminal would be easier to be used instead of tmux\nThe required terminal app could be stored in some settings file and used opening shell scripts\n. ok, cool\n. thanks for the PR, this only work for first initialisation, up.command will not use tmux as obj-c calls up.command shell script via iTerm.\n. thanks for spoting it, and for the PR, will cut a new release tomorrow\n. thanks for the PR \ud83d\udc4d \nbtw is the latest app version working fine for, specially VM's UP, as there is issue opened #151 whcih I cannot reproduce\n. sleep I know was the issue before for sure. @AntonioMeireles can you confirm/explain about sleep?\n. hmm, strange one, will make a new app dmg soon\n. @iamShantanu101 can you please download k8solo v0.9.9 again, I uploaded rebuilt version, thanks\n. can you provide some more detailed setup on your side\n. maybe so macos glitch\n. Loadbalancer is cloud provider feature, e.g.GCP, AWS, it will not work on any kube app or any vagrant based setup\n. yup\n. sure, was going to delete the old versions anyway\n. thanks for reporting, yes I get the same problem with the Dashboard after VMs reboot.\nHmm nothing works in kube-system namespace.\nNeed to investigate it why.\n. fixed in v1.0.0\n. it is not in panic mode, it is just encoded text :)\n. I will keep it open till we sort out qcow-tool dependencies in corectl\n. we hope to handle that with qcow-tool soon\n. thanks for PR. could you please remove macOS changes to OS X, as it is now called macOS\n. cool thanks, will review and merge later one, doing house duties right now :)\n. thanks, all good, I have merged it :)\n. thanks a lot @martinhoefling for this one, that missing docker binary was on my ASAP list.\ni will test PR tomorrow and cut new version then.\n. @martinhoefling could you replace curl -o ~/kube-solo/bin/docker https://get.docker.com/builds/Darwin/x86_64/docker-$DOCKER_VERSION.tgz to curl -O https://get.docker.com/builds/Darwin/x86_64/docker-$DOCKER_VERSION.tgz?\nas there is no .tgz downloaded.\nthanks\n. no worries, fixed it myself\n. could you try to delete SecurityContextDeny  https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/blob/master/src/cloud-init/user-data#L168 in ~/kube-solo/cloud-init/user-data and check if that fixes for you. if it does I will cut a new app version.\nthanks\n. i'm off this week, will do it when i'm  back. fixed in https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases/tag/v1.0.1. hey there, there are many different local k8s solutions. it is not up to me to tell users to use kube-solo app instead of minikube.. added a short text about kube-solo and minikube difference. it could be your network borked, VirtualBox loves to do that, just try to reboot your mac, thanks. sudo systemctl stop docker and sudo systemctl start docker is the way, strange it did not work for you. I do not see that as a big deal as usually I reboot VM for such needs.. @AntonioMeireles any idea what could be wrong with Openpgp there?\nWithout looking to logs I cannot tell why your iTerm2 crashes.. the crash report that popup when Iterm2 starts ones, please\ncan you try to install Openpgp and see if that helps?. ok, that's the iTerm crash log, no idea why that app crashes.\nwhich version of iTerm you have there?. /Applications/Kube-Solo.app/Contents/Resources/kube-solo-install.command is the script app starts, but it will not work from terminal on it's own.. try to reboot your Mac.\nAlso how did you install kube-solo and corectl? \nkube-solo needs corectl.app) which takes care of corectl install.\nWhat did you install with brew ?. ok, I see, the brew stuff is not mine, so I cannot comment what is wrong with the install.\nUninstall them and install from releases:\nhttps://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl.app/releases\nhttps://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/releases\nthen let me know, thanks . uninstall openpgp and try https://gpgtools.org/. GPGTools work just fine for me.\nmust something specific with your Mac setup. kube-solo menu has an option Preset OS shell which has all kubectl and docker settings set.\nThe file is:\nhttps://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/blob/master/src/os_shell.command. please open an issue at corectl as kube-solo is just a wrapper around it.. do not think so @AntonioMeireles had a chance to get it working yet. yes, seen that a few times, not really easy to reproduce.\njust delete the data.img file and run Up from menu, in my case it works the second time.. hey there, you are using the wrong host path, which point to in memory folder.\nyou need to use /data one, so your data can persist.. you need to change your mongodb deployment to:\n...\n        hostPath:\n          path: /data/var/mongo\n...\n. really weird one, but wasn't able to reproduce it. sorry for the late delay, you can add the --insecure-bind-address or --basic-auth-file in this part https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/blob/master/src/cloud-init/user-data#L164-L179. where are you adding --basic-auth-file=/Users/weisburd/kube-solo/cloud-init/basicauth to?. you cannot point to file that way, copy that file to VM first. here is the part where you can add files https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-solo-osx/blob/master/src/cloud-init/user-data#L270 them use that path --basic-auth. thanks, merging it. \ud83d\udc4d . kube-solo only supports etcd v2 for now (needs work on it), kubernetes v 1.6 and v1.7 only work with etcd v3 . not sure that is really related to kube-solo, but apps they do behave differently on local and cloud deployment. we are going to cut a new https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl version hopefully tomorrow, to fix that issue\n. I'm waiting for @AntonioMeireles to release a new version of https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl . ",

    "AntonioMeireles": "@olalonde hi, thanks for reporting! \nwhat did you had/have in /etc/exports before ? could you paste it here please ?. (also, you're running latest version of kube-solo-osx, right ?)\n. @olalonde i guess that if you comment the 1st line things would work. Can you confirm please ?(the issue here is that parent dir is already exported when we're trying to export just your $homedir). will try to figure a way to handle this smoothly. \n. @piepkrak \nHi! could you please paste here your existing /etc/exports ?. For some reason it isn't passing our smoke tests... And many thanks!\n. @piepkrak \nthe issue here is that corectl expects to be able to export via NFS ${HOME} and that fails because a subdir (actually in your case, quite a few ones) of it is already set as exported (via Vagrant). Unless there is a way,in OS X, that i'm unware of, of exporting at same time both a dir  and a subdir of it, i think that the best i can do here is just print a more meaningfull failure message telling that we're unable to export ${HOME} because some dir inside it is already exported.\n. @rimusz, \nlong(er) story short - having a warning/check is a good thing to have, OTOH allowing VMs to boot without ${HOME} being properly exported on host tricky as a lot of functionality ends depending on just that ... Will need a carefull deep look. \n. @rimusz commenting on https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl/issues/71 \n. fixed in https://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl/releases/tag/v0.5.6\n. @BrunoBonacci can you plz paste here you existing /etc/exports ? thanks!\n. humm. just remove the file plz and try again.\n. df -k output please. (sorry lag - on the road this weekend)\n. ah! your homedir is under /home which is itself a mountpoint so it looks that nfsd is failing to export the homedir. will do some research and come back to you early monday. \n. yes, sorta... soon one will be able to define the mountpoint locations a la carte which workarounds this in some way... after that we plan to stop relying in NFS which will end this issue once and for all. \n. it is. the issue is how to do that in a simple/reliable way (i.e via some sort of machinery we provide). \nto do it manually one just need to have it available on host and on VMs side pass via custom cloud-config   a specific systems service set to mount it at boot (similar to the one that mounts inside the VM the host's homedir. \n. humm. this doesn't seem a deterministic issue here too. \n@mboersma - for context and to try to scope this issue - OS X version/RAM & hw version ?(not an hackintosh, right ?) . do you get anything in the system logs (command-space > console > search for corectl)  ? thanks!\n. @dmcnaught,  are you by chance behind a firewall ? (trying to isolate root issue)\n. brew install corectl\nsudo corectl run\ngist plz output of ifconfig, and systemctl list-units of the VM. (and THANKS for your patience) \n(to exit the VM run sudo halt)\n. @dmcnaught what Mac (model) are you running this ?\n. interesting as that definitivelly supports Vt-x/EPT. dmesg output plz.\n. doubt it as also use it :-) \n. better. for the 1st error  coreos pull -f would do the trick. \nfor the second ... paste your /etc/exports plz \n. strange. lack of image shouldn 't give us trap errors. will try to reproduce.\n. corectl version gives you what ? you are running 0.5.10 right ?\n. explained... too old. brew update && brew upgrade --all should set you right ... (/me crosses fingers) \n. about to go afk. what timezone are you in ? will reach you tomorrow to sort this out\n. ok. i'm in GMT-0. ping me on your morning. will be around. \n. @dmcnaught i'm n another live debug session atm .. will ping you here after that one :-) \n. @dmcnaught can you ping me in kubernetes' slack please ?\n. @dmcnaught fwiw the issue isn't VM's /etc/resolv.confbeing populated with nameserver 192.168.64.1 (where 192.168.64.1 is the address of vmnet's interface), that's macOS' default behaviour. The particular issue in your specific env is that somehow albeit traffic was getting to the outter world from inside the VM the mac wasn 't fwarding back to the vm the DNS queries it was receiving from it, so name resolutions wasn 't working out of the box breaing everything that depended on it. You ended workarounding it by pointing the the VM to a DNS server other than hosts one.\n. @cobrowserAlex try this...\ncorectl q k8solo-01 -j | jq -r \".[] | .InternalSSHprivate \"  >  ./foo\nrsync -ave \"ssh -i ./foo core@$(corectl q k8solo-01 -i)\" ./secret/ k8solo-01:/mnt/secret\nshould work ... \n. a) THANK YOU! \nb) try plz\ncorectl q k8solo-01 -j | jq -r \".[] | .InternalSSHprivate \"  >  ./foo ; chmod 700;\nrsync -ave \"ssh -i ./foo core@$(corectl q k8solo-01 -i)\" ./secret/ k8solo-01:/mnt/secret\n.

Tried again from scratch and couldn't reproduce!\n. Indeed. Trying to make it work with tmux seems like a bit of a PITA. Another option would be to see if a flag can be passed to open -a iTerm.app \"$1\"/first-init.command to tell iTerm to ignore the \"send text at start\" setting. That would probably be ideal. What do you think? (asked here https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5288)\n. Looks like another way would be to chose a profile called \"kube-solo\" if it exists and otherwise use the default profile: https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html. That way, I could create a \"kube-solo\" profile which doesn't send text at start.\n. Oh, looks like there will be a new option in iTerm to \"disabled text at start when opening a script\" https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5288. \ud83d\udc4d \n. ",

    "whitlockjc": "I think I just found out you already do this: \"Kube-Solo App can be used together with CoreOS VM App which allows to build Docker containers and has a private local Docker registry v2 which is accessible from Kube-Solo App.\"  Feel free to close this once you confirm.\n. I'm an idiot.  I see that this VM along with the CoreOS VM App gives me what I need.  Sorry about the noise.\n. I'm going to reopen this because things still aren't working and I'd like to see if we can get this figured out.  When I run the CoreOS VM App, I do indeed have a Docker Registry.  But when I try to docker push, I get the following:\nThe push refers to a repository [192.168.64.1:5000/testing] (len: 1)\nunable to ping registry endpoint https://192.168.64.1:5000/v0/\nv2 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://192.168.64.1:5000/v2/: tls: oversized record received with length 20527\n v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://192.168.64.1:5000/v1/_ping: tls: oversized record received with length 20527\nIf I use http to access the Docker Registry API, it works fine.  (This test was performed via the browser.)\nAlso, the more I think about this the more I realize that the initial request is still somewhat valid.  It would be slick of kube-solo-osx had a private Docker Registry running in it and the Kubernetes configured to use it.\n. I get you.  There's no need to bulk up the kube-solo but I'm still wondering why my attempt to docker push results in errors and it appears to be because the Docker Registry isn't running via https.  I say \"appears\" because of the error and because I have no expertise in the area to confirm one way or another.\nI'm all for keeping two VMs for the reasons you stated but I do think we'll need to sort out the reason that docker push does not work with the Docker Registry running on the CoreOS VM.  Thoughts?\n. So what do I need to do for things to work?  I just run docker push right now and docker is the one forcing, or assuming, https.  I'll keep googling.  Thanks again.\n. Cool.  Maybe since I never used docker pull, something wasn't setup properly.  I just built an image locally and then tried to push it.  I'll try your approach and if you don't hear from me, things are working fine.\n. The fix was to unset DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY and DOCKER_CERT_PATH.  This could use some documentation and I'd be happy to add it if you want.  Here is a working example: DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.64.3:2375 DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY= DOCKER_CERT_PATH= ~/coreos-osx/bin/docker ps  Of course, if I just run DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.64.3:2375 ~/coreos-osx/bin/docker ps, that's when I get the error related to oversized record received with length 20527.  Every person on my team ran into this so I'm sure it's somewhat common, especially if you already run docker-machine as it's the tool that is setting these DOCKER_* environment variables.\n. I think that would help, or even documenting something to the effect of \"Coexisting with docker-machine\" or \"Migrating from docker-machine\".  Regardless, thanks for all of your help and I'm glad I was able to figure it out.\n. Is this still up for debate?  I just ran into this situation as well when attempting to update ~/.kube/config to connect to another k8s environment.  I updated the file as expected, tried to kubectl config use-context my-new-context only to have it fail.  I remembered setting my environment to use the kubectl from kube-solo and when I looked into it, it's a shell script that sets --kubeconfig to always use $HOME/kube-solo/kube/kubeconfig.  I'd really love to avoid having one k8s configuration file for kube-solo and another for the rest of my k8s environments but I defer to your judgement.\n. I tested everything locally but extra testing is a great idea.  Let me know if there is more I can do.\n. Thanks @rimusz.  This will make my life much easier.  :)  I have a ~/.kube/config that is configured for multiple clusters, including my kube-solo cluster, and being able to bounce contexts using kubectl config use-context ... was a pain before this.  Much appreciated.\n. Here are the pertinent links to the Kubernetes docs (this isn't an RTFM but since they've got documentation, it seemed simpler):\n- Authentication: http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authentication/\n- Authorization: http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/\nThe problem I'm trying to solve first is I want to provide the necessary --oidc-* options to the apiserver upon startup so that I can enable token-based OpenID Connect authentication.\nI realize that this might not be something you want to support within kube-solo but if we can work together on an approach, I don't mind writing the documentation so that others could do this.  Being the optimist I am, I do bet there is some way we can make kube-solo pick up some configuration (environment variable, config file, ...) from the host system on an opt-in basis.\n. @rimusz If I've got kube-solo already running, how should I go about changing the fleet unit and getting it deployed?  I've not used fleet directly so I'm not even sure how to start.  I'm hoping I can use a kube-solo distribution and that I don't have to build/run a custom one.  If that is the case, do you mind pointing me in the right direction on getting started?\n. I just realized kube-solo ships with a fleet UI so I will start there.\n. So as things stand now, I could update ~/kube-solo/fleet/kube-apiserver.service and restart the VM to alter how the k8s apiserver is started.  But if fleet goes away, I'd instead update ~/kube-solo/cloud-init/user-data to do this by creating a systemd unit.  Is this correct?  I'm just trying to make sure I understand things correctly.\n. I've had trouble updating to v0.8.7 for now so until that is fixed, what is the appropriate flow to doing this?  I've tried altering ~/kube-solo/fleet/kube-apiserver.service and bouncing the VM but it doesn't seem to pick those changes up.  I've tried the reload/update fleet unit menubar item and it just overwrites my changes.  What is the suggested approach to do this with fleet since it's the only way to do it locally for me right now?\n. Thanks a lot @rimusz.  I did finally figure out the fleetctl process to get this working.  Now that I'm switching to the cloud-init approach, how do I follow the same flow to update the apiserver and redeploy it after changes?\n. I think it's possible to keep it enabled all the time but it would likely not make sense.  I wanted to test the OIDC support for authentication and now that I've done that, I want to switch back to the default kube-solo approach using a certificate.  I do think that if you want a simple kube-solo, you don't want extra authn/authz.  But if you find the need to test or use authn/authz, knowing how to enable it would be pretty useful.\n. You got it.  I'll go through the process to make sure the halt, up process just works and then we could easily document this as a So You Need a Custom API Server section or something.  ;)\n. Enabling authn/authz is the same.  You update your ~/kube-solo/cloud-init/user-data to provide the necessary enablement flags to the kube-apiserver.service.  Have you tried this?\n. That will work just fine, I forgot you were mounting this.  Thanks a lot.\n. I'm not sure this is working and it could be my own issue.  Whenever my service tries to start, I get this: /Users/notyou/workspaces/go/src/github.com/coreos/dex/bin/dex-worker: No such file or directory  I'm not saying there is a kube-solo issue but I'm not having luck.

I think my corectl.app was borked.  I updated it too and when it started, it never prompted me for my password so I assume it just wasn't running.\n.

And if so, should I do the same with https://github.com/TheNewNormal/kube-cluster-osx?\n. Sweet, I did just that and all is working now. For posterity the process was:\n1. Remove all versions of go via homebrew\n2. Install go v1.7.1 via homebrew\n3. Compile kubectl according to https://medium.com/@gerred/kubectl-1-3-7-for-macos-sierra-ee2c483e283d#.l9sop4jje\n4. Stop kube-solo and rm -rf ~/kube-solo to prepare for a fresh install\n5. Start kube-solo and start the initial setup\n6. At the first prompt asking for CoreOS version, copy the newly compiled kubectl to ~/kube-solo/bin`\n7. Resume kube-solo install\nThanks for your help!\n. ",

When I press the Iterm crashes so I can't see anything else. The version I have is Build 3.0.15\nIt seems that for MacOSX there is no openpgp available. I have already installed gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.30 with libgcrypt 1.7.0\nThere is no way to launch the 'initial-setup of the kube-solo VM' manually and see what is going on?. So? What do you recommend? should I pass some parameter to that shell script in order to try it? or may be I should reinstall `kube-solo` + corectl? I think I did it, at least with the 1st using `brew uninstall` without success. Hi.\nI've installed both using `brew` with:\nbrew cask install corectl-app\nbrew cask install kube-solo\nAfter that, it seems that something is broken with corectl-app because no core-OS VM is running and also is impossible to download it -`iTerm2` crashes again :-(- \nAny recommendation?\n. I verified that the versions of the applications that brew are installed are exactly the same as you have released.\nI found that I get the same problem after trying to download the stable image from CoreOS application: (`/Applications/corectl.app/Contents/Resources/fetch_latest_iso_stable.command`):\nFetching lastest CoreOS stable channel ISO\u2026\n[WARN] /Users/.../.coreos/images/stable/1298.6.0/coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz missing - stable/1298.6.0 ignored\n---> downloading and verifying stable/1298.6.0\n[ERROR] openpgp: invalid data: user ID packet not followed by self-signature\nYou already have the latest CoreOS ISO.\nPlease press [Enter] to continue.\n```\nAgain the problem with openpgp. As I said before, I don't have openpgp installed I have already have GPGTools installed. oh! It seems that finally I found the problem!\nDon't know why but the command ./fetch_latest_iso_stable.command tries to download and verify the sum of the file was incorrect. May be a corrupted/broken file? Then the problem (I suppose) is that the verification of the downloaded file it was impossible and that's the reason of the failed message. Here you have it:\n```\nFetching lastest CoreOS stable channel ISO\u2026\n[WARN] /Users/.../.coreos/images/stable/1298.6.0/coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz missing - stable/1298.6.0 ignored\n---> downloading and verifying stable/1298.6.0\n33.47 MB / 33.47 MB [=====================================================================================================================================================] 100.00 %\n---> SHA512 hash for coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz OK\n235.47 MB / 235.47 MB [===================================================================================================================================================] 100.00 %\n---> SHA512 hash for coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz OK\n---> stable/1298.6.0 ready\nYou already have the latest CoreOS ISO.\nPlease press [Enter] to continue.\n```\nSo, I supose that happens exactly the same problem with the ./kube-solo-install.command. Because after removing those coreosfiles it seems that the command and the VM with the cluster booted up successfully. \nBtw, finally, what kind of variables (and path) do we need in order to use kubectl from any other shell? And docker? I asking this that because Iterm2 still crashes when I try to SSH to the machine.\nBest,. ",
