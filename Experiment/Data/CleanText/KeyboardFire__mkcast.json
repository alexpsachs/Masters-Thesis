Done! newcast now finishes recording when the terminal it spawns exits. Thanks for the idea!\n. Are you sure you have a window open with the title \"Terminal\"?\n. It's saved as out.gif in the directory from which you run it.\n. Sorry, the example was outdated (-c no longer exists). Try:\n$ mkcast Terminal 10\nor\n$ newcast\n. gnome-terminal is not a hard requirement. It works perfectly fine for casting, say, a web browser as long as you feed it the right title.\n. That file can easily be changed. Or you can just use mkcast instead of the convenience askcast script.\n. Ugh... I wanted this to be GIF-only, but fine. New syntax:\n$ newcast -o out.webm  # also supports ogg/ogv\n. Thanks, this is fixed now.\n. Thanks, not sure how I missed that.\n. OS X support is not currently planned.\n. Fixed via your own pull request (thanks!).\n. So don't run it twice? That's why it's called a \"setup.\"\n. No worries, my fault for not checking over the pull request closely enough ;) Thanks!\n. ",

Once we compare we can change the regex to get the right info.\n. @tdlm @nickdesaulniers could you test this line works on your machine echo '    dimensions:    1440x877 pixels (381x232 millimeters)' | awk '{print $2}' if so I'll submit a pull request\n. lol this'll never work on osx due to the dependency on gnome-terminal. It was fun diving into xquartz anyway. @tdlm I got output from wmctrl but you need to run it within a terminal that's launched by xquartz \n\n. yeah not sure how this software works but my guess is it finds the window and targets some screen capturing software. Then translates the video to a gif.\nWould be cool to make gifs from the output of http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?script Not sure if it's possible.\nupdate: uses Byzanz-record so it's screen to gif directly.\n.
