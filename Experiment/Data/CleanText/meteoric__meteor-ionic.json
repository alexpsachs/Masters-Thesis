    "mrn3": "+1\nI noticed this problem too\n. +1\n. I would love this feature too - is anyone working on it?\n. ",
    "nickw": "Yep, agreed.\n. Yeah that looks great.\n. @dennisharrison Cool - what's the thinking behind storing the history in a collection rather than just using the browser API? Have you done anything around actually swiping to go back? If so, does it actually slide the page at all? Or just immediately go back?\n. @dennisharrison any help we can get would be much appreciated! I'm definitely open to trying GSAP.\n. @dennisharrison sounds good. For some background:\nI haven't done any 'scientific' testing around frame rates or anything, but in my experience most of the animations are pretty smooth using CSS animations, the problem seems to be mostly with transitioning between routes using _uihooks - especially when a route relies on data from the server to be rendered. \nFor instance, the routes in https://github.com/meteoric/demo seem to slide back and forth pretty smoothly, but the templates are all static content. \nMost of the complaints seem to come from https://github.com/meteoric/meteorhunt and https://github.com/meteoric/contacts where the routes are dynamic and the transitions can get pretty laggy. My assumption is that it is caused by Meteor and/or iron:router loading data at the same time the routes are being animated.\n. ionNavView is responsible for sliding the \"pages\": https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionNavView/ionNavView.js#L29\nionNavBar handles animating/fading the titles and buttons: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionNavBar/ionNavBar.js#L27\nBoth of these just add/remove CSS classes from the elements, the CSS framework does the heavy lifting: https://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass/blob/master/stylesheets/_transitions.scss\n. This post might have some good info for us:\nAnimating the Mobile Web\n. @dennisharrison awesome - looking forward to it!\n. I think we can narrow this down to three issues:\n1. Flickering\nA known issue: http://nathanhoad.net/how-to-stop-css-animation-flicker-in-webkit. Adding this CSS seems to fix it, but I'd like to get a second pair of eyes on it:\n.view {\n  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\n  -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;\n  backface-visibility: hidden;\n  transform-style: preserve-3d;\n}\n2. Jittery / staggered transitions\nI've been able to confirm that the occasional choppy or staggering transitions are definitely caused by Iron Router's waitOn and data. If the data property loads immediately, the transition is seamless, but if there's any delay at all, the initial view will transition out, then there will be a noticeable delay before the new view transitions in.\nI'm looking into implementing template-level subscriptions, which appears to fix the issue, but this technique doesn't play well with block helpers. We may have to wait for the official template-level subscriptions or this PR to be released.\n3. Low frame rate\nI think this is primarily on Android. Not sure what the solution is yet.\n. @dennisharrison re: # 3 it's my understanding that CSS animations are almost always going to be more performant (especially on mobile platforms) than JS-based animations, so while I'm skeptical, I'm certainly open to give it a try (I also don't have any better ideas at the moment). \nSo if either GSAP or Velocity fix the animation issues definitively I don't have a problem including them with this package.\n. > Can you merge the PR from Digilord to fix up the data binding for the position of header buttons if it hasn't been fixed in 1.13?\nI'm not sure which PR that is - can you link to it?\n\nAlso I notice someone saying that 1.13 is not working them on iOS and Android? Is that reproducible on your side?\n\nNope, working fine for me - you have a link?\n. > Can you merge the PR from Digilord to fix up the data binding for the position of header buttons if it hasn't been fixed in 1.13?\nAh I see it now, that issue was fixed a while back.\n\nAlso I notice someone saying that 1.13 is not working them on iOS and Android? Is that reproducible on your side?\n\nOk yeah that's #78, I've heard it's an issue for several users but I can't reproduce. For some reason it isn't finding the Cordova plugin com.ionic.keyboard/1.0.3 - which definitely existed at one point. Upgrading the dependency to 1.0.4 should fix it.\n\nWe also added in hammer.js for gesture control (went through 6 methods before finding something simple and worthwhile), but I want your input on that before trying to package up for meteoric.\n\nLet's move that discussion to #2 \nLet me know when you think you'll have a chance to create a PR for animations. If it's not going to be today I'd like to go ahead and push a new release to Atmosphere to fix some of these other issues.\nThanks!\n. Potential 3rd party component to utilize: http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/\n. Ended up using https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/\n. Yeah it's as close as I think I can get it in Meteor. The basic API is:\n{{#ionSlideBox}}\n  {{#ionSlide}}Slide 1{{/ionSlide}}\n  {{#ionSlide}}Slide 2{{/ionSlide}}\n  {{#ionSlide}}Slide 3{{/ionSlide}}\n{{/ionSlideBox}}\nThe available options you can pass to ionSlideBox are:\n- doesContinue\n- autoPlay\n- slideInterval\n- showPager\nThere's also an onSlideChanged event that you can listen to in your parent template:\nTemplate.tutorial.events({\n  'onSlideChanged': function(event, template) {\n    Session.set('currentSlideIndex', event.index);\n  }\n});\n. Well I think we want to mimic Ionic's native-inspired design, which we get for free by including their CSS framework, so I'm not sure sweetalert really buys us anything. But thanks for the suggestion.\nIf anyone's interested in implementing this component themselves, take a look at the action sheet component to see how a similar component is implemented.\n. Ah right, it's in 0.1.17 on Atmosphere. Closing this.\n. It should be pretty straightforward unless something is broken. What isn't working for you specifically?\n. Ah right, contacts comes from the route: https://github.com/meteoric/contacts/blob/master/both/router.js#L10\n. Correct. The current ionList and ionItem components are just HTML wrappers right now.\n. Awesome work @koolaid1551 - really excited to see this get implemented.\n\nusing slip.js\n\nWell we're already using snap.js and slick.js, so slip.js seems like a good choice :)\n\nI am currently relying on a few classes to be apart of each list '.list' and list items '.item-content'. I am hoping to find a cleaner way of accomplishing this(potentially create a few more components)\n\nHmm yeah that does seem less than ideal. Maybe take a look at how Ionic is doing it, I think they are automatically detecting and adding those classes.\n\nTo show hidden options I believe I am going to have to modify slip.js to reveal options beneath a list item.\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by \"hidden options\"?\n\nhttps://github.com/koolaid1551/contacts\n\nOne small bug I noticed here is that when I drop an item after reordering my click registers and navigates to the item's routes.\nBut yeah, this seems like a great start. Let me know when you think it's ready for a PR and take a closer look at it.\n. @jorjordandan sounds good - go for it!\n. Initial implementation in: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/commit/015341d0192408578708dccf80dc86345d1d1e61\n. @ccorcos do the example apps help in the meantime? If not, I'll try to write something up tonight or tomorrow:\nhttps://github.com/meteoric/contacts\nhttps://github.com/meteoric/meteorhunt\n. Ok guys, here's something quick I whipped up: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/GUIDE.md\nLet me know if it's helpful at all, and what else you'd like to see.\n. @rjakobsson can you add a new issue for this? I'm not sure how it's happening since we're grabbing the backUrl directly from the template options, and falling back to history.back() see the code here. If you can post some code in that issue that would be awesome.\n. @benstr wow looks great\n. Thanks @Slava \n. Possibly, but it might make things harder to maintain / understand. I'm fine with leaving it as-is for now, but feel free to suggest some solutions.\n. Hmm that's strange, no idea what that would be. What does the --debug option do exactly? What version of the package is getting installed on Modulus?\n. @maabed any luck with this? I deployed my first meteor-ionic app to Modulus last night and didn't experience this.\n. Hmm, what version is specified in your .meteor/versions file?\n. Update: I was able to get a Nexus 4 running Lollipop for testing. Here's what I've found:\nThe Contacts example and Meteor Hunt are both pretty laggy when it comes to navigation transitions and modal transitions.\nThe Demo App seems pretty good.\nI think the difference is that the Demo app has mostly static templates/data, while the other two examples are using real data.\n. I pushed some minor improvements related to Android animations earlier this week (but haven't released a new version on atmosphere yet). Also @dennisharrison is working on some general animation-related performance issues in: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/4.\nI'm not sure exactly why it's so much slower on Android (although I've noticed everything on Android is pretty clunky compared to iOS), but I'm confident we'll be able to get it fixed.\n. @dennisharrison ok great, thanks for the update. \nIf I get time I'm going to experiment with using -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d; to get rid of the flicker. \nIn general, I'd love to be able to solve these issues with standard HTML/JS techniques like requestAnimationFrame as opposed to adding a large dependencies like GSAP, but at this point whatever works is good enough for me.\n. Did some digging on my own this weekend and updated here: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/4#issuecomment-73446896\n. Here's a graphic that explains why we can't rely on URLs to set the current tab but instead have to use a Session variable. Notice the active tab for each of the routes:\n\n. I'm not sure I understand the question, you should be able to put a menu on only one side like this:\n{{#ionBody}}\n  {{#ionSideMenuContainer}}\n    {{#ionSideMenus}}\n      {{#ionSideMenu}}\n        side menu content\n      {{/ionSideMenu}}\n    {{/ionSideMenus}}\n    {{#ionSideMenuContent}}\n      // your apps content, tabs, headers, etc:\n      {{> yield}}\n    {{/ionSideMenuContent}}\n  {{/ionSideMenuContainer}}\n{{/ionBody}}\nLet me know if that doesn't work.\n. Can you explain what you mean by \"having two side menus\"?\n. Ah I see what you mean. We're using Snap.js under the hood, so I'm not sure if that's just the way it works, or if we have to set a configuration variable, or what. Feel free to take a look at their docs, otherwise I'll take a look in the next few days.\n. Hey guys,\nI just added this commit which allows you to pass a side option to the ionSideMenuContainer component like so:\n{{#ionSideMenuContainer side=\"left\"}}\nor\n{{#ionSideMenuContainer side=\"right\"}}\nor\n{{#ionSideMenuContainer side=\"both\"}}\nand it will take care of disabling the correct side for you.\n. Hmm yeah I haven't tried to do this yet. I think because of the way iron:router works, you'll have to configure a loading template, and then perhaps do your IonLoading calls in the rendered and destroyed callbacks of that template.\n\nAlso, can you guys refactor so that we don't have to send an object into the show method? That way we can just do IonLoading.show(). Currently, doing that will throw an error because the delay property is not found.\n\nYeah, good call. Can you open a second issue for that?\n. I've realized that using iron:router's waitOn and data features don't fit well with the way mobile routes are supposed to animate. iron:router takes a very traditional, server-side approach to rendering templates (wait until all the data is loaded, then render), whereas mobile apps and modern web apps take a more fine-grained approach and render pieces as needed (see Sacha's blog post on template-level subscriptions).\nI've implemented a pattern in the meteoric example apps (see this commit in the contacts app) that works much better by allowing the template to be rendered an animated to immediately (no choppiness) while showing a loading spinner and loading the data on demand. \nOnce template-level subscriptions are supported in the Meteor core, I can remove a lot of the boilerplate from this pattern, but in the meantime I wouldn't recommend using waitOn with meteor-ionic.\n. Thanks Robin!\nYes, you should get that functionality \"out of the box\" with no extra work in the latest version of meteor-ionic. Let me know if that is not the case.\n. Hmm, I'd be open to a PR for this, but I personally don't have a use for this functionality. One of my primary motivations for building meteoric was to be able to build \"cross platform UIs\" that look appropriate on Android as well as iOS.\n. > If a title is always left-aligned, it assumes that Androids don't ever have a top-left button? Or if they do, then there's no title? How would you advise?\nFor now the left button will just show up to the left of the title (like the back buttons do).\n\nFacebook pushes all buttons to the right. Interesting.\n\nYeah, I haven't tackled the \"all buttons on the right\" feature for Android yet. It's on my todo list.\n. Yeah that's what we're doing now actually, but it seems like it's more common for Android apps to have all the buttons on the right (except for back buttons and hamburger menus).\nHere's an app I'm working on right now:\n\nAnd here's the Meteor Hunt app on Android:\n\nI think in the Meteor Hunt case, it would be better if the search icon was on the right.\n. Yeah that would be amazing!\n. Yeah I think that looks good! Have you tested this new version?\n. We are currently using the SASS versions of the Ionic framework that can be customized using SASS variables, as opposed to the static/minified CSS versions which would require you to manually overwrite CSS rules. It looks like your suggestion is using static CSS?\n. The advantage to using the SASS version is that you can customize the output of the SASS using variables rather than overriding / duplicating CSS. e.g. with one line of code $positive: #2196F3; you can change the color of dozens of UI elements.\n. Do you have an ionHeaderBar or ionNavBar in your layout?\n. Ah that's not currently possible. Personally I prefer to allow the platform to determine the tab location (Android on top, iOS on bottom), but I'm open to a PR that allows more flexibility.\n. Ah interesting. We could create an ionButton component pretty easily. Or, I've been putting all global event handlers on the ionBody element, so we could add your listener there. Are there any downsides you can think of to either approach?\n. Works for, feel free to create a PR for this. I may not get to it until this weekend.\n. Ah I see you added it with the multi-modal PR. Looking at that now\u2026\n. Closed in https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/pull/38\n. Hmm that's a bummer. The only thing I can think of would be to make myCustomHelper into its own template and move myCustomProperty there. Hopefully someone with more knowledge can chime in with a more Meteor-like approach.\n. @benstr @spencercarli can you guys take a quick look and see if this was one of your PRs? \n. @dancering I just published 0.1.11, let me know if you are still experiencing this after updating.\n. Ah good question, haven't had that usecase myself yet.\nWe are currently skipping transitions when using tab navigation, we just set IonNavigation.skipTransitions = true; in a click handler:\nhttps://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionTab/ionTab.js#L25\nI think you could do the same in your sidemenu.\n. Yeah I think we'd just need a resize listener (probably attached to ionBody) that manually opens the side menu once the viewport reaches a certain width.\n. Yeah, I'd love to see someone create a PR for this as I can definitely see how it would be useful. I don't have the time/need to do it myself right now, but may be able to in a few weeks. Here are some thoughts I have:\n- It should definitely hide the corresponding \"hamburger\" button when the window is wide enough to expose the sidemenu.\n- I think this could be implemented in either ionBody or ionSidemenuContainer\n- It would be great if it could work on both the left and the right side\n- Maybe it should disable snap.js altogether when wide enough and override the CSS, rather than trying to fight with snap.js\n. Yeah I think ionSidemenuContainer is best if possible. I'd prefer not to pollute ionBody more than necessary.\n. I don't think so. I probably won't work on it until I need it for an app.\n. Yeah, that's actually a really good example of a simple component that can easily be re-created in meteor - so I went ahead and did it :) Let me know if this works out for you: http://cl.ly/0W2P0A3l3o2U. I think the code is actually a lot cleaner and more flexible than the Angular code, too.\n. The way ionic works is that the ionContent component has to know about which components are above or below it. If you use the built-in ionTabs, ionHeaderBar, ionFooterBar, etc components, the ionContent component will automatically have the necessary has-tabs, has-header, etc classes.\nSo in your case, you can either use the ionTabs component, or just add the necessary class to your ionContent like so:\n{{#ionContent class=\"has-tabs-top\"}}\n. Nope not really. I just try to mimic the Ionic APIs as close as possible and ideally not add any custom CSS. You can look at the way I implemented ionActionSheet to see how ionPopup might be implemented. For the slidebox I was probably just going to look for a good 3rd party plugin to include the way I did for the side menu stuff.\n. @dcsan have you seen #5? Or is this statement in reaction to #5?\n. @dcsan sorry I was confusing snap.js with slick.js :)\nTo get around snap.js dragging, you can also add a data-snap-ignore attribute to any element or container.\n. No, it's not the desired behavior. We are constantly fighting with meteor over the this.data property inside templates. I'll just need to sit down and figure out a global fix for this in all the components. However it's very strange that I haven't yet experienced this issue once in any of my apps or demos.\n. Thanks for the reproduction:) I just pushed something that should fix it - let me know!\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jan 31, 2015, at 12:51 PM, Encontrando a Meteor notifications@github.com wrote:\nThanks for the reply @nickw\nI'm using Meteor 1.0.3.1 and I tested this on Chrome 40.0.2214.94 (64-bit) and Firefox 37.0a2 (2015-01-21)\nI created this repo to reproduce the issue: https://github.com/findingmeteor/minimal-meteroic\nI hope it helps\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Yeah, this is an issue with fourseven:scss https://github.com/fourseven/meteor-scss/issues/60\n. @dcsan I'm not sure what stylus has to do with it? We need to stick to whatever preprocessor Ionic is using so we don't have to convert the files. I think there are other, possibly better, SCSS solutions for Meteor. Feel free to investigate. I haven't hit this issue yet, so I haven't tried to fix it yet myself. Alternatively you could just manually put all the scss files in your app for the time being.\n. > it's a smooth sailing alternative to using the hot mess of sass compilers\nWell, so is Less ;) Which is why I was wondering why Stylus kept entering the discussion. But yes, I absolutely agree that we need to figure out better, cleaner SCSS support.\n\nso how do you avoid these issues?\n\nSince I haven't experienced them myself, I'm not sure yet.\n. @dcsan yeah the demo app has an example, I think you're just missing ionSideMenuContainer.\n. #31 and #27 seem to be related to this, but I'm totally stumped on what's causing it and am unable to reproduce.\n. Yeah I haven't published a new version yet, will do ASAP.\n. There's a few things going on here:\n1. has-badge is a CSS class, not a style option:\n   {{#ionTabs style=\"ios has-badge\"}} should be {{#ionTabs style=\"ios\" class=\"has-badge\"}}\n2. I think badge=\"{{badgeCountHelper}}\" should be badgeNumber=\"{{badgeCountHelper}}\"\n3. badge-style=\"badge-assertive\" hasn't been implemented yet, but probably needs to be.\n. Yes, the entire Ionic CSS framework is bundled up into the meteoric:ionic-sass package:\nmeteor add fourseven:scss\nmeteor add meteoric:ionic-sass\n. Hi Chris,\nCan you give me some background on this? Is drag-content something from Ionic? What is the expected behavior?\nThanks,\nNick\n. Ok guys, you can now pass a dragContent option to ionSideMenuContainer like so:\n{{#ionSideMenuContainer dragContent=false}}\n. Yeah I noticed that too in one of my projects, I had to add this CSS:\n.tab-item {\n  // Ionic bug, needed to position badges:\n  position: relative;\n}\nHowever I just looked and Ionic has this CSS rule:\n.tab-item.has-badge {\n  position: relative;\n}\nSo I think we should automatically add the has-badge class in meteor-ionic if you pass a badgeCount option.\n. I'm very curious to why this is happening in the first place. My understanding was that this.data in a template callback referred to the options passed to the template (e.g. {{> myTemplate option=\"value\"}}) - and it appears it is most of the time - but sometimes this.data also refers to iron:router's data property?\n. Nah I gotcha - and will most likely merge this - I just felt like there was an underlying issue we are missing and this is just a temporary fix. Hoping somebody with deeper meteor knowledge can weigh in. I may post an issue on the meteor and iron router repos. \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jan 27, 2015, at 5:22 PM, D.

You would probably do it the way you would a normal checkbox, just use a template helper to save the state and toggle the checked attribute.\n. Yeah, that should work. \n\n@benstr any thoughts on this?\n. The entire purpose of ionNavBar is to dynamically display titles and buttons based on routes. If you want a static bar you will want to use a ionHeaderBar.\n. Closing this in lieu of #60 \n. Ah yeah I haven't come across that use case myself, so haven't implemented it. For now I would probably just throw something in the rendered callback of that template that hides the header:\nTemplate.myTemplate.rendered = function () {\n  $('.bar-header').hide();\n  $('.content').removeClass('has-header');\n}\nThen you might have to reset them when you leave:\nTemplate.myTemplate.destroyed = function () {\n  $('.bar-header').show();\n  $('.content').addClass('has-header');\n}\nI'll see if it's easy enough to add this to the core.\n. No, we're not using Ionic's scrollView.js functionality, we're just using -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; for now.\n. Yeah I've noticed this particularly in modals. I believe it's something to do with native keyboards, and Ionic has a Cordova plugin that will probably fix it: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard.\n. I don't think this has anything to do with Meteor 1.0.3.1, it sounds like 2.0 version of fourseven:scss has possibly changed the way it handles import paths. For now we only support the 1.x version of fourseven:scss.\n. I'm not sure this will be possible to do dynamically since we can't currently read the current status bar style in order to revert to it.\nInstead, I think it might be better to just provide callbacks for IonModal.show() and IonModal.hide() and allow devs to change the status bar style themselves.\n. This was fixed over the weekend but I haven't pushed a new version to Atmosphere yet. I'll plan on doing that today, but in the meantime you can symlink the repo into your packages directory if you want.\n. Yeah, it is a dependency in meteoric:ionic-sass, I have an issue open to remove the dependency: https://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass/issues/1\n. Here ya go: https://github.com/meteoric/demo\n. :)\n. Check the version of meteoric:ionic in the .meteor/versions file. It sounds like they have an old version.\n. Yes, we do that so you can customize the framework using scss variables as intended.\n. Looks like we can use document.addEventListener('backbutton', function(event){});\n. Yep, thanks @maersu !\n. Hmm that's strange, I haven't encountered that yet myself. Does this happen in the Contacts app as well? Or in Ionic's docs?\n. Hmm, I'm not sure why it's not finding 1.0.3 of this plugin: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard\n. @maersu no, others are experiencing the issue too. It looks like v1.0.3 got removed for some reason. I'll be pushing 0.1.14 today that will depend on ionic-keyboard 1.0.4\n. Ok guys, v 0.1.14 has been published.\n. We're currently achieving this same functionality in an app by just changing/animation the scrollTop property of the relevant content area.\n. Hey @dcsan - thanks for the PR. However, I like to stay away from ids as there are too many possibilities of conflicts. You could accomplish the same thing by passing a class like messages-container - that's what we're doing in our app. Either way, I plan on implementing a feature to allow you to pass any attributes (id's, data- attributes, etc) to all meteor-ionic components (https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/60) that would accomplish the same thing. If it's ok with you I will close this and defer to #60.\n. Ok cool, closing for now\u2026\n. Ah no I haven't. For now I just manually pass a text attribute to ionNavBackButton and set the back text manually. This seems to work fine 90% of the time.\nI think the component we'd want to replicate is the ionicHistory service. It looks like @dennisharrison may have started something here: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/3#issuecomment-74607917\n. We (Differential) are using it on a large client project right now and haven't run into any issues with it yet. The client is very happy with how \"native\" it feels and is now converting another app from Bootstrap to Meteor-Ionic.\n. You can do that, you'll just want to use a standard Meteor event handler and toggle it there:\n'click .hide-footer': function (event, template) {\n  $('.footer-bar').hide();\n  Session.set('hasFooterBar', false);\n},\n'click .show-footer': function (event, template) {\n  $('.footer-bar').show();\n  Session.set('hasFooterBar', true);\n}\n. Swipe cards won't be a part of meteor-ionic unless they become a part of official Ionic. My recommendation would be to use https://github.com/gajus/swing - it should integrate with Meteor just fine.\n. Oops, yeah it looks like PR #73 from @fpoirier1 forgot to allow passing a custom barClass. @fpoirier1 would you be available to add that as a new PR?\n@rizkysyazuli in the meantime you can do something like this:\n{{#ionModal customTemplate=true}}\n  <div class=\"bar bar-header bar-energized\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\">Products</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"content has-header overflow-scroll\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n{{/ionModal}}\nAlso I believe focusFirstInput is now true by default, so you can save a few keystrokes on that.\n. Hmm are you running the latest version (0.1.14)?\n. Can you post your template code?\n. Yeah, that's very strange, I'd definitely be interested in seeing your code. My bitbucket username is nickwientge.\n. > Hmm are you running the latest version (0.1.14)?\n\nyep. just updated. still the same. if you need me to provide any other info. just let me know.\n\nYour app is showing 0.1.12 in .meteor/versions - I updated it and it works fine.\n\n. Nice looking app btw :)\n. Yeah, I'm not sure why Ionic uses a custom attribute on the parent element like that, you can just add title-left, title-center, or title-right classes directly to the <h1> element itself.\n. Which version of meteor-ionic are you running? Can you post a screenshot or some template code?\n. Hmm, is that in Chrome's emulator? The content area is supposed to shrink to make room for the keyboard, that is expected. However I'm not sure why you aren't seeing a keyboard?\n. > It's like the whole app is resized for the keyboard to appear under it's container.\nCorrect, that's the intended behavior. Without that the entire web view gets pushed up off the screen, pushing your fixed headers and other content out of view. This technique keeps everything in place, but shrinks the size of the viewport. This is the way Ionic and native apps work as well.\nHowever I've only recently implemented this feature, and have only tested it on forms inside of modals - and only on iOS, so perhaps you've discovered a bug that I haven't.\nI'm still not 100% clear on the issue you are experiencing. In the second screenshot why is the device smaller? Where is the keyboard?\n. Hmm, can you break these out into 2 separate issues - since they appear to be unrelated?\nHere's how I'm understanding it:\nIssue # 1: iOS inputs don't scroll into view if they are below the keyboard\nThis seems like a quick fix using setTimeout\nIssue # 2: Android keyboard pushes the entire UI out of view\nThis seems like an issue of just getting the Cordova settings right or something. Have you looked to make sure it's not an issues with the Ionic Cordova Keyboard plugin? There seems to be several open issues related to Android there.\n. @elGusto @lispur I was just testing Android and experienced this myself. I disabled all the keyboard detection stuff on Android and it seems to work fine, so maybe it was only necessary on iOS.\n. Yeah, that Hackpad is the way to go. I haven't tried it yet myself though.\n. Interesting, we're having a similar issue with Chrome not repainting our UI when using HTML5 video elements and WebRTC calls. Seems like they might be related. We'll dig into it this week.\n. You should be able to do something similar to #83 \n. Right, that's what the Session variable is responsible for. In your case I think you would need to toggle Session.set('hasTabs', false); and Session.set('hasTabs', true);\n. Wow great work! I'll do some testing and get it merged in ASAP. Thanks!\n. Yeah, my thinking was that this way users could bring their own version of Ionic - or use a different preprocessor - if they wanted. Might revisit this later based on user feedback.\n. @wrannaman No, I haven't seen that yet. Will try to test soon.\n. Yeah we don't necessarily have a 1:1 mapping between Ionic components due to various differences between Meteor and Angular. You'll want to check the list of components before attempting to implement one: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/tree/master/components\nFor what you're trying to do you can just use iron:router regions inside your templates: https://github.com/meteoric/meteorhunt/blob/master/client/templates/products/productsShow.html#L3-L15\n. Yes, just add data-keyboard-attach to the element: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionKeyboard/ionKeyboard.js#L50\n. Unfortunately not until I get around to implementing #60. In the meantime here's what I'm doing in my app:\n<div class=\"bar bar-footer bar-stable\" data-keyboard-attach>\n  <form class=\"item-input-wrapper form-send-message\">\n    <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter Message\u2026\" name=\"message\">\n    <button class=\"button button-positive button-clear\" type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n  </form>\n</div>\n. Ive seen that on Android from time to time, not sure what is causing it yet though. Here's a good place to look: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionHeaderBar/ionHeaderBar.js#L20\n. @dcsan see the note under Installation in the ionic-sass README: https://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass#installation. This is a limitation of fourseven:scss and Meteor in general.\n. Good question. I think you can call Session.set('ionNavDirection', 'back'); before calling Router.go() and that should work. Let me know if not.\n. I realize this is ugly, but did you try:\nSession.set('ionNavDirection', 'back');\nMeteor.setTimeout(function() {\n  Router.go('wherever');\n}, 100);\n. @PolGuixe so does that work?\n. Obviously we need a real solution here, but in the meantime can't you just manually do what's being done in the event handler?\nhttps://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/c190e8cd67d6180a44357eed871bd115ea008a85/components/ionBody/ionBody.js#L61\n$('[data-nav-container]').addClass('nav-view-direction-back');\n$('[data-navbar-container]').addClass('nav-bar-direction-back');\n. Yeah, creating a meteor-specific version of this is definitely on my TODO list. In the meantime you might want to check out: https://github.com/ccorcos/meteor-icon-splash-maker\n. I'm not going to try to tackle it right now, and it's probably out of the scope of this specific repo.\n. This is more of a general Meteor/Iron Router question that should probably be posted to Stack Overflow or forums.meteor.com\n. @bastiRe I was experiencing that exact problem until I implemented https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/commit/55085b3800912542b41992326bd51ac468068acd. But I don't think that commit is on Atmosphere yet. Can you try cloning this repo into your packages directly and let me know if you still experience the problem?\n. Thanks @dcsan. I actually started using this pattern in other components: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionModal/ionModal.js#L66 - perhaps we should stick with that?\n. Yeah I guess I didn't consider that when porting it over. I think we can just remove this conditional: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionPopover/ionPopover.js#L74.\n. @MFQ that looks correct. Have you tried running meteor update to make sure you have the latest versions of all the meteoric packages?\n. Hmm yeah I think those are included in the Meteor core, not sure there's much we can do about that. You might want to ask on https://forums.meteor.com/\n. Are you experiencing any specific issues?\n. Yeah CSS seems like the way to go. I'm thinking you could override the bottom value of this:\nhttps://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass/blob/master/stylesheets/_scaffolding.scss#L29\nto be the height of the ad. That way any footers or tabs you add will be positioned above the ad automatically by Ionic.\n. _appId:this.appId should be _appId=this.appId\n. This seems like an iron:router issue, not a meteoric issue. But to confirm, have you tried not using an ionItem and instead just doing an <a class=\"item\" href=\"{{pathFor 'module.show' _id=this._id  _appId=this.appId}}\">{{name}}</a>.\n. @benstr any thoughts on this?\n. Looks great, thanks!\n. You can also add data-ion-menu-close to links: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/c190e8cd67d6180a44357eed871bd115ea008a85/components/ionBody/ionBody.js#L87\n. Oh, so does Ionic always close the side menu when you click links? If so I think we should definitely mimic that behavior.\n. PR in the works: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/pull/291/\n. This is definitely something I want to figure out, but I haven't looked at it enough to even know where to start. I think the basic idea is that we need to be able to tell iron router to render routes into different regions.\n. I haven't had that issue, but it seems like it's an issue with Ionic's CSS, not our Meteor implementation. I would probably post this on the Ionic repo.\n. This is more of a general Meteor discussion / suggestion, I don't think it's  related to meteor-ionic.\n\nOn Mar 22, 2015, at 2:20 PM, evc notifications@github.com wrote:\nwhy this closed without reply\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. That's just a limitation in the way Meteor/iron:router route animations work. I don't know of any workaround yet.\n. Guys, I don't have time to look at this right now, but it should be pretty easy to troubleshoot / diagnose:\n\n1- Clone the repo into your app's packages directory:\n$ cd yourApp/packages\n$ git clone https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic.git meteoric:meteor-ionic\n2- Try removing the com.ionic.keyboard dependency (https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/package.js#L8-L10). What happens?\n3- Add com.ionic.keyboard back in, and try removing these lines: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionKeyboard/ionKeyboard.js#L47-L49. What happens?\n. Well, removing com.ionic.keyboard is only a temporary fix. com.ionic.keyboard is necessary for the UI and keyboard to interact the way users are accustomed to native apps behaving (specifically retaining fixed headers and footer when the keyboard is open as opposed to pushing the entire UI offscreen).\nI probably won't have time to fix this until I work on an Android app that experiences this issue. In the meantime hopefully someone can step up and figure out why com.ionic.keyboard isn't playing nicely with Android.\n. You probably just need to override this line: https://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass/blob/master/stylesheets/_scaffolding.scss#L25\n. @bastiRe do you have any thoughts on this?\n@perusopersonale does myTemplate exist when you are calling IonPopup.show()?\n. @sircharleswatson nope, doesn't look like that's currently possible, but maybe @bastiRe can confirm?\n. @sircharleswatson absolutely!\n. If it's just CSS then you'd just need to add their CSS to your project. Did you try it and run into issues?\n. Hi @txs, we're just using https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/ for side menus. You'll want to check their docs to see if they support this.\n. Here's where snap.js gets initialized: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionSideMenuContainer/ionSideMenuContainer.js#L14-L36\nYou can't currently pass any other options to it, but that should be pretty trivial to implement if you'd like to submit a PR. Alternatively you might be able to grab the element out of the DOM and apply options retroactively - not sure if snap.js supports that or not though.\n. Yes, it is possible, but neither Ionic or Meteoric offer anything in the way of help. You'll just have to write your own custom component with your own custom JS and CSS.\n. I think you can just pass a custom class to the ionTab:\n{{> ionTab class=\"my-tab\"}}\nAnd then attach an event handler in your template like normal:\n'click .my-custom-tab': function(event, template) {\n}\n. You will want to open the modal using this method: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionModal/ionModal.js#L11\n. @ecuanaso I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to accomplish, but I'm pretty sure you don't need any of this code:\n```\nthis.template = Template[profile];\n    var view = Blaze.renderWithData(this.template, data, $('.ionic-body').get(0));\nif (!this.view[profile]) {\n  this.view[profile] = [view];\n} else {\n  this.view[profile].push(view);\n}\n\nthis.views.push(profile);\n\nvar $modalBackdrop = $(view.firstNode());\n\nif (this.views.length === 1) {\n  $modalBackdrop.addClass('active');\n}\n\nvar $modalEl = $modalBackdrop.find('.modal').eq(0);\n$modalEl.addClass(this.enterClasses.join(' '));\n\n$modalEl.on(this.transitionEndEvent, function () {\n  $('body').addClass('modal-open');\n  $modalEl.removeClass(this.enterClasses.join(' ')).removeClass(this.enterActiveClass).off('webkitAnimationEnd');\n}.bind(this));\n\nMeteor.setTimeout(function () {\n  $modalEl.addClass(this.enterActiveClass);\n}.bind(this), 10);\n\n```\nIt should be as simple as:\nTemplate.ionTabs.events({\n  'click .profile-modal' : function(profile, data){\n    IonModal.open('nameOfExistingTemplate');\n  }\n});\n. ion-refresher hasn't been implemented. You can either open a PR to implement it, or use an existing pull to refresh plugin:\nhttps://github.com/jordansinger/hook.js/\nhttps://github.com/visiongeist/pull-to-refresh-js\nhttps://github.com/apeatling/web-pull-to-refresh/\n. > Is the way is works is that you have imported all the css for the ionic framework. And then you are using Blaze templates and helper files to add and remove classes from the elements to correspond to the correct function? So basically it is just about dropping in the native ionic css, and then just adding and removing classes at appropriate times?\nTypically, yes. But I believe ion-refresher relies on Ionic's ion-scroll component, which is a customized version of Zynga Scroller. This allows Ionic to perform custom scrolling functionality - such as pull to refresh, among others.\nSo for this component we will probably need to find an off-the-shelf pull to refresh component, and then figure out how to get it to work with Ionic's CSS. This is what we did for the ionSideMenu and ionSlideBox.\nHere's the relevant CSS we'll want to try to use: https://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass/blob/master/stylesheets/_scaffolding.scss#L181-L259\n. @sferoze I would definitely be open to us implementing both ion-scroll and ion-refresher, but I assume that will be quite involved. If you have the bandwidth then definitely feel free to tackle this. Otherwise I was thinking an off-the-shelf plugin would be quicker.\n. It has rubber band scrolling when running on the device, it's not needed or desirable on the desktop.\n. @aaronthorp Have you tested this on an iOS device yet? When I originally implemented this there was a bug in iOS where if you animated the scroll right after focusing an input, the keyboard cursor wouldn't update its position and would be displayed outside of the form field.\n. The scrolling is handled using this CSS on an .overflow-scroll element. There's no special scrolling functionality, so you should be able to listen to the even normally.\n. Hmm maybe we don't. Maybe there could be memory leaks though if we keep re-initializing the plugin?\n. Sounds good, PRs are always welcome!\n. > But is still ugly see the images being in a list in the transition.\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by this, but I assume it's a FOUC type situation? In that case maybe you just need to add a preloader to that route?\n. Nice, very helpful.\n. I assume you mean while testing on the device or simulator? If so, there are remote debugging options for both iOS and Android\n. Yes, you can pass href instead of path: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionTab/ionTab.js#L26\n. The style=\"android\" is what is putting them on the top. I don't think it's currently possible to put android style tabs on the bottom in meteor-ionic, I think from a design/UX perspective that would be potentially confusing to Android users anyway.\n. It may just a CSS/display issue, I've used that plugin in a meteoric project with no issues.\n. Only a few of the ionContent options have been implemented at this time. You can see all of them in the source code: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionContent/ionContent.js.\nAs for why your viewport is too large, I'm not sure, I've never experienced that myself. Perhaps something inside the viewport has a large fixed width?\n. Unfortunately it's heavily dependent on iron:router - or more specifically iron:layout. We make heavy use of contentFor regions. I would like to remove this dependency, so I'm open to a PR.\n. Yes, this is a known issue with Meteor that will be solved in an upcoming update.\n. This is a known issue with Meteor that will be solved in an upcoming update.\n. Actually I think you just need to use an HTML5 number input: <input type=\"number\">\n. Probably because the headerButtonRight region is rendered outside of your template? Try adding the event handler in your layout.\n. Sorry, I think this is outside the scope of meteoric.\n. I believe this is the same issue: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/50\n. You shouldn't have to add or change anything. IS it possible you have some other CSS rules causing the gap?\n. Hmm, there's something wrong there. The header should be behind the status bar, not under it. You might be missing a wrapper div or something, can you post your template and layout code somewhere?\n. What is framing? I'm pretty sure ionBody has to be the root element: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/GUIDE.md#ionbody\n. We're using Slick.js, you might want to take a look at their docs: https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/\n. This is great - thanks!\n. I think you can just set this to false: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionTab/ionTab.js#L9\n. There shouldn't be any issues with Meteoric+jQuery, Meteoric makes extensive use of jQuery internally.\n. Not sure, I would need to see some docs on how Ionic View works internally.\n. I'm assuming this feature requires bundling an angular-ionic app to Ionic's servers - so probably not possible with Meteor.\n. You should be able to pass an animation name to your ionNavView as you can see in the source. The animations you can use are in the sass: _animations.scss.\n{{#ionNavView animation=\"slide-in-up\"}}\n{{/ionNavView}}\n. Yes this requires a bit of custom CSS. Here's what I've done in the past:\n```\n.bar-footer {\n  .item-input-wrapper {\n    background: none;\n    padding: 0;\n  }\n.button-clear {\n    width: 60px;\n  }\n.button-block {\n    margin: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n<div class=\"bar bar-footer bar-stable has-tabs\" data-keyboard-attach>\n      <form class=\"item-input-wrapper form-send-message\">\n        <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter Message\u2026\" name=\"message\">\n        <button class=\"button button-positive button-clear\" type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n. This is most likely related to one of the outstanding Android keyboard bugs e.g. https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/130\n. I don't have any plans to attempt a 1.0 upgrade right now. \"Swipe to go back\" in particular will be quite difficult to implement and will probably require a custom router (or a heavily modified version of an existing router). I'm also much more interested in React and React Native right now, but if my interest returns to Ionic I will definitely look at upgrading.\n. Unfortunately this needs to rely on Session since tabs aren't necessarily tied to routes. e.g. take a look at the behavior of the tabs in http://meteorhunt.meteor.com/ (especially the profile tab).\n. In a mobile app the tab bar represents overall sections of the app, not individual screens. So in the Meteor Hunt example when I click on the \"profile\" tab I am in the \"profile section\" of the app and that tab should stay highlighted until I choose another tab. From a user's profile I can navigate to individual posts that a user has voted on. If the tabs were tied to routes, the highlighted tab would change when I navigated to the post detail route.\n. I think we just need to implement the hardware back button: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/issues/71\n. Well technically the back button shouldn't change the tabs. Each tab should have it's own navigation stack. At least that's the way it works on iOS.\n. You don't need the ion- part when specifying the icon like this.\n. @train860 this would require some way of caching the data and the template which is currently outside the scope of this project.\n. @maxzzznz Tabs are working fine here: http://meteorhunt.meteor.com/ - which is using the latest versions of all the packages.\n. App.icons are for specifying the icon(s) that shows up on a device's homescreen - not the icons within your app's UI. To add addition UI icons you would just need to use CSS as usual.\n. @elGusto I'm open to refactoring to allow multiple routers, but I don't have any time right now to contribute unfortunately. Also, if there are clear advantages to Flow Router over Iron Router I'm open to just switching them out as well.\n. It's probably something to do with the way iron:router generates routes. What are the listItems objects exactly? Check out: https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router/blob/devel/Guide.md#path-and-link-template-helpers\n. That's right, anything inside of {{#contentFor \"headerButtonRight\"}} will be pulled out of your template and injected into the layout, so you'll need to attach events on the layout.\n. @elie222 can you fix the conflicts on this? Once you do I'll merge this in and release the latest version. Thanks!\n. @elie222 it looks like the Popups section of the docs has some issues (maybe caused by a previous merge):\n\n. Actually it looks like the last paragraph and code block should be a part of the Modals section above.\n. @yokas this is a general Meteor question and isn't specifically related to meteoric. A simple Google search for \"meteor local storage\" returns several useful results, including: https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-mobile-app-local-storage/2646\n. For now you should be able to manually set Session.set('ionTab.current').\n. On a device <input type=\"date\"> will trigger the native datepicker, which is I believe is why Ionic doesn't include their own. I also don't think we want to include any components in meteoric that aren't in Ionic.\n. We'd also need to figure out how to handle rendering into regions:\nhttps://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionNavBar/ionNavBar.html#L3-L5\n. From the README:\n\nIt aims to be a complete port of Ionic\u2019s Angular directives to Meteor Blaze templates.\n\nIonic components are Angular directives. Meteoric attempts to replicate Ionic's Angular directives using Blaze templates.\nSo instead of:\n<ion-content>\n  <p>Your content here</p>\n</ion-content>\nYou would write:\n{{#ionContent}}\n  <p>Your content here</p>\n{{/ionContent}}\n. Hi @mervynteo this seems like something specific to your CSS, but feel free to reopen if you are still experiencing this.\n. Unfortunately there isn't, but I hope to add some in the future. However most of the components are pretty small and you can usually take a peak in them to see what methods are available to you.\n. Well that blank space is supposed to be underneath the status bar (clock, battery, etc). I can't remember for sure, but I thought that was just a Cordova setting that was on by default in Meteor.\n. Hmm I've never had to explicitly set that option in any of my apps - it always just worked.\n. Ah, actually it appears I have these settings in my default mobile-config.js\n. None of the components in the http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/ list require any Meteoric integration - they are just static CSS components and are all already included along with the https://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass package.\n. Unfortunately there's no built-in way, it has to be done manually.\n. Yeah that shouldn't be checked, I wasn't aware Ionic had that functionality.\n. This is a known issue with Meteor that will be solved in an upcoming update.\n. I haven't tried yet. I'm wondering if the upgraded Cordova in Meteor 1.2 (meteor update --release METEOR@1.2-rc.7) will fix this?\n. I think this is the appropriate behavior. Switching tabs should also set up a new \"navigation stack\". There shouldn't be anything to \"go back\" to after switching tabs.\n. Published!\n. I haven't looked that them closely yet, but as long as they are just CSS themes I don't see any reason why they wouldn't.\n. Hi @jorjordandan, is there any reason we couldn't call the attribute just id?\n. @jorjordandan maybe we should also bump the ionic-sass dependency in this package so users don't end up with an old version of the CSS?\n. Oh you're right, I think I deliberately didn't specify a dependency on ionic-sass so that users could bring their own version if they wished (compiled CSS, a LESS version, etc). So maybe it's OK as is.\n. Ah good call.\n. @jorjordandan this is looking good, but I noticed in my testing (https://github.com/meteoric/demo/blob/master/client/templates/spinner/spinner.html) that the Android spinner doesn't animate. Any ideas?\n. Not sure if the below error is related:\nReferenceError: $element is not defined\n    at start (ionSpinner.js:445)\n    at init (ionSpinner.js:440)\n    at Template.ionSpinner.rendered (ionSpinner.js:422)\n    at template.js:116\n    at Function.Template._withTemplateInstanceFunc (template.js:437)\n    at fireCallbacks (template.js:112)\n    at null.<anonymous> (template.js:205)\n    at view.js:104\n    at Object.Blaze._withCurrentView (view.js:523)\n    at view.js:103\n. In Ionic the body doesn't scroll. There's a dedicated div for scrolling content that has the classes .content.overflow-scroll. You'll want to monitor the scroll event on that div.\n. Looks great @jorjordandan! Would you be able to update the README and check off these components? Also if you have time, it'd be great to add this to the demo.\n. It doesn't require any JavaScript, just HTML and CSS:\nhttp://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#toggle\n. > Having a navigation view pull up from the bottom like a modal is a key need for 'popping up' an item to work with. The standard modal can't be used because we need more customizability over the content, header buttons and transitions.\nYou'll still want to use a \"modal\" as opposed to a navigation transition. \"nav transitions and directions for up/down\" aren't really a valid use case on mobile - transitions are always left to right - so those won't ever be added. \nInstead I would suggest you either:\n1. Use the existing modal component with the customTemplate options like so:\n{{#ionModal customTemplate=true}}\n// Any HTML you want goes here\n{{/ionModal}}\n1. Create your own component and just copy over the pieces of https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionModal/ionModal.js and https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionModal/ionModal.html that you need.\n. > I'm wondering if it's possible to have a modal that can then have navigation left/right transitions within it.\nThat would be a great feature to have, but I don't think that's something that can easily be done with iron:router. We'd need some kind of nested routing functionality. You could create multiple screens within a modal that just get swapped out independent of routes - just using a Session var or something to track the current screen - basically like tabs.\n. We are including the fastclick dependency as part of meteor-ionic: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/package.js#L17\nI would try to confirm that the package is indeed part of your project and that the necessary JavaScript is being loaded.\n. Hmm yeah that shouldn't be happening. It's possible something isn't set up correctly. Is there any code you can post? Have you followed the basic structure of the example apps like Meteor Hunt?\n. I don't think it would be a trivial migration, and I personally don't have plans tackling it now that Meteor has good support for Angular.\n. I'm not officially abandoning this project (yet), but I'm not using it personally, and wouldn't recommend it for anything more \"serious\" than a prototype or MVP. For users that don't want to use Angular, there are React alternatives such as http://reapp.io/.\n. @pors No, I haven't seen anything else for Blaze. Personally I haven't found Blaze to scale well with an app's complexity, and it doesn't seem to be a priority for MDG, so I think React or Angular are the way to go moving forward.\n. Meteoric is great for rapid prototyping and simple apps, but I'm no longer maintaining this package and am recommending official Angular Ionic for serious, production apps.\n. It is possible to use Bootstrap and Ionic together, but not recommended. They are both trying to do similar things so you will probably get lots of conflicts.\n. Sorry about that, I just updated the README.\n. @danlg you can probably just fork the project and remove these lines: https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/package.js#L8-L10\nThen install the package from your fork.\n. Thanks for adding docs! The only thing bugging me is the urlFor option. Maybe instead we have both path and url options, an we can infer which IR method to use based on that?\n. Probably don't want to leave these in.\n. Well I think it's the \"option\" concept that is bothering me, and I'm hoping we can choose the correct \"option\" for the user rather than forcing them to:\npath='item.detail' -> use pathFor\nor:\nurl='item.detail' -> use urlFor\nDoes that make sense?\n. Can you explain what this is doing?\n. Should we be committing this file?\n. Should this inline CSS be here?\n. Gotcha, let's remove that then. I'll try to get all the packages updated and synced up ASAP.\n. @jorjordandan It looks like data[k][x] is undefined here - any thoughts? I assume this component can just be used like {{> ionSpinner}}? Or does it need extra params?\n. @jorjordandan Ah I see now you have to pass an icon attribute. There's a few issues with this PR I'd like to see fixed before we release a new version:\n1. We should default to ios if no icon attribute is passed.\n2. There is too much \"state in the DOM\". We shouldn't be setting id attributes on the element and then using that to determine the type. The type should be stored internally on the component. In general id attributes are a bad idea since they have to be unique.\n3.

Please use 2 spaces instead of tabs for indentation.\n. This still seems really fragile to me. Is it not possible to get this.icon or this.data.icon here?\n. Yeah, we're doing that in other components as well (e.g. https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionModal/ionModal.js#L83-L90 https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/blob/master/components/ionModal/ionModal.js#L83-L90) so I think it'd make sense to keep following that pattern here.\n\nOn Aug 27, 2015, at 2:53 PM, jorjordandan notifications@github.com wrote:\nIn components/ionSpinner/ionSpinner.js https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic/pull/293#discussion_r38150926:\n\n\nrc: 'repeatCount',\nsw: 'stroke-width',\nt: 'transform',\nv: 'values'\n};\n  +\nvar SPIN_ANIMATION = {\nv: '0,32,32;360,32,32',\nan: 'transform',\ntype: 'rotate',\nrc: INDEFINITE,\ndur: DURATION\n};\n  +\n//get icon name and element from blaze template\nvar iconName = this.firstNode.className.split(' ').pop();\n  it is, but if no icon is passed, the this.data.icon doesn't exist, and you can't set the default value in the helper because the data is read only .... aaaand as I was typing this I realized I could just set the default in the rendered callback... doh!\n\n\nThe icon name still has to go into the class list for the css to be applied though.

    "rclai": "+1\n. Wouldn't this Meteor integration of Hammer.js be good for this?\n. Regarding number 2, these functions from this package might be able to help with getting the template instance from inside a content block. As a matter of fact, I just realized how incredibly useful that entire package is.\n. @dennisharrison, are you going to use this package as mentioned in #2 to implement the hammer.js stuff?\n. Would it be a long way off if I suggested using Sweet Alert?\nhttps://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert\n. No problem.\n. Yes, I had a feeling it was performance-related.\n. The loading template using rendered and destroyed to do the show and hide worked great.\n. In subscriptions function, aren't you supposed to do this.subscribe()?\n. If a title is always left-aligned, it assumes that Androids don't ever have a top-left button? Or if they do, then there's no title? How would you advise?\n. Oh wait, I guess according to your article here:\nhttps://medium.com/space-camp/cross-platform-uis-for-mobile-meteor-apps-6f12b583b205\nFacebook pushes all buttons to the right. Interesting.\n. Oh you know what I noticed. So when I looked at the android Gmail and maps app, I noticed they have a left aligned menu button and the title is actually aligned left too but right next to the menu button. Check it out. \n. Performance-wise, putting the event handler on ionBody is better since we get to leverage the efficiency of event delegation and it's easier on the memory.\nAlso, I found out that the .activated class is an alias to the .active class. There's like 140 occurrences of it on the Ionic style sheet. What a waste of file size, what were they thinking?\n. I should've created a new branch so I could've submitted it separately.\n. Sweet, thanks.\n. Turns out this is a meteor bug: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/3540\nYou're off the hook hehe. \n. Perhaps making it router agnostic is more palatable?\n. @nickw, let me know what you think of this idea and whether I should keep going at it when you have the time :smile: \n. Thanks for the feedback guys.\n. @arunoda, that sounds like a great idea, but I can't envision how to do that since there is router logic in different components. Can you show me a small example?\n. Ah okay, sounds good. I'll give that a try.\n. Oh wow, router-layer might just be the answer. I'll check it out later.\n. @nicolaslopezj, are we able to use the Layout template to render things into regions to tackle the issue that @nickw mentioned for this?\nGiven that it is {{> yield \"regionName\"}}, how does that translate in Router Layer.\n. If you have multiple modals open, and you press Escape, all modals are going to close because the keyup is going to be triggered on all modals. By adding that line of code, you're able to close one modal at a time when pressing Escape.\n. Yeah, that is going to change, thanks.\n. ",

    "dennisharrison": "@nickw We have history working as long as routes are hit via userHistory.goToUrl(\"/your/url/here\").  Just added this today and we have more work on documentation and and option for event snagging on  tags wherever they are if the domain is the same.  But, now this way at least goBack() is much more sane than window.history.back().\nSample implementation:\nhttps://github.com/dennisharrison/mapp-skeletor/blob/master/app/packages/user-history/client/history.coffee\nInterested?  Only been using it for a few hours but we're happy with the results so far.\n. I would suggest GSAP for this - more than willing to help!\n. @nickw \nOK, let's do this first for the side menu animation since we'll be touching that this week anyway.  Then you can comment and we can figure the best refactor methodology.\n. @nikw \nInteresting.  Can you link the line that kicks off the animation you see the choppiness with?  I'll do a quick test with GSAP there first to see if there is any real gain.\n. After some profiling it looks like the css 3d translation of the parent element of a container full of 3d translated (to get them hardware accelerated) causes the blinking I'm seeing.  If we take that class off the child elements before doing the translate of the parent element (say sliding) then I don't see the 'jitter'.  Working on making the toggle work without autoform and then can submit a pull request showing the difference for you to test. \n. 1. Great - this fixes it without re-classing anything.  I'll toss that helper method out and use this instead!\n2. This is an interesting problem, https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/3546 looks like the solution for it though.\n3. I don't want to stray from your goals for this project, and create wasted time where we implement two separate solutions to this.  Let's pick a method you want to go for and I'll concentrate there.\n. @nickw You're correct.  Except on Android (which is pretty odd!), which handles redraw very poorly.  GSAP and Velocity have performance parity with CSS transitions now in almost every case, but the performance on Android is better.  I wish I understood why, since that shouldn't be the case.  \nLet's try and fix it without anything else first.  On the road today but I'll finally be able to give this a day tomorrow.\nHave you run into this one?\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10014461/why-does-enabling-hardware-acceleration-in-css3-slow-down-performance\n. @nickw \nI've spent the last two days with this.  We can do it with CSS, pull request coming - but I'm doing all this with 1.11 and Android still isn't as smooth as iOS, but I think that's just going to be the case.\nCan you merge the PR from Digilord to fix up the data binding for the position of header buttons if it hasn't been fixed in 1.13?\nAlso I notice someone saying that 1.13 is not working them on iOS and Android?  Is that reproducible on your side?\nThanks again for such an awesome package! :)\nI'll try to update and then merge all changes and see where we are.  We also added in hammer.js for gesture control (went through 6 methods before finding something simple and worthwhile), but I want your input on that before trying to package up for meteoric.  It requires a little bit of manual setup in the template.  I'm not sure of the overhead of doing it on 'everything' so I think we should figure out a way of conditionally turning it on an element or not, but it seems like events are getting gobbled up by being in the helpers inside of the templates.  I'll start an issue with a link to example code once we get the css and layout changes in.\nAlso - just for anyone who runs across this issue in the future:\nRead this first:\nhttp://greensock.com/css-performance\nCheck this out to see a method for alleviating the majority of the issues the author mentions with CSS draw times:\nhttp://codepen.io/paulirish/full/9712e8fb6a451e0ee7393d01e7f59f53/\nTL;DR version:\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/look-and-feel/animations/css-vs-javascript?hl=en\n. I just saw the issue about 1.13 and mobile when browsing for this one on the laptop.  Looks like it's likely a non-issue.\nI can't find the PR off-hand.  Hey @digilord do you have that available?\nIn the meantime here is the change that mattered.\nhttps://github.com/digilord/meteor-ionic/commit/dd3248035b0dd1d5469c3386cd32cf499c19a4fd\n. @nickw Go ahead and push release today, headed into Valentines Day territory here :)\n. Coming soon, promise.\nI'm going to update meteor-ionic after implementing more hammerjs gestures and refactoring some stuff on the sample project I'm using to learn all this - and then send along the PR for the css changes to animations.\nI've been playing with hammerjs and gsap to handle the menu slide animation based on finger placement and rewind the animation, etc.  Feels more native that way.  I still think the package should stay default css though to not bring in that dependency.\n. @rclai No I manually included hammer and the jquery plugin. Like this\nLatest updates on everything has me see'ing much better Android performance.  Also - Meteor Template based subscriptions is a huge help here.  Display a spinner until template subscriptions are ready. Template subscription and Template conditional\nOverall, I'm very happy with performance since this change.\n. @guilhermedecampo haha, thanks :)\nGood question, and I wish I was good enough to give you a less anecdotal answer than \"everything works better and faster with template based subscriptions.\"  It's hugely helped the Android animation performance, among other issues - such as extra items in collections for short amounts of time due to subscriptions not being explicit enough before render.\n. @nickw \nChecking in on this issue - letting you know the flickering is pretty trivial to fix a number of ways.  The Android animation performance can be solved with using GSAP or the like.  I've been sidetracked from this with implementing file upload management and Froala inside a sample meteor-ionic project.\nhttps://github.com/dennisharrison/mapp-skeletor\nThis isn't ready for public consumption by a long shot, but I'll be putting the performance css and js animation tweaks in here first - have meteor-ionic as a local package currently.  I'm aiming to get you the pull request to make the flickering stop and smooth the animations this week coming up.\n. @nickw \nI agree with you on not adding dependencies: I think in this case the positives outweigh the negatives of dragging along that extra dep.\nYou could use requestAnimationFrame but there are GSAP & Velocity packages which shave off a lot of the rough edges, there is a lot of work done here.  If you wanted to pick one over the other and use their jQuery animate() compatible plugin then a user of meteor-ionic could swap them out on a whim as they both feature API parity for jQuery animate().\nI need GSAP for other things in the mobile projects that velocity won't handle - so this would be a boon to me personally :)\nMoving rest of this to #4 \n. @digilord & @dancering\nWould also love to see this implemented. In Ionic when using this it renders the menu differently than the 'slide out' method in that it doesn't push the content over and the toggle no longer functions. For tablets and desktop this would be a great help. It's actually rendered to the left or right of the content instead of starting in the same space as the slide animation. \nI haven't spent enough time to understand how @nickw would really want to implement this in meteoric, but am willing to help. \n. @nikw I think it should disable snap.js of the element when this happens (and re-enable on resize) and then override the CSS.  I'll dig into this in particular when I'm working on visual stuff this week.\nionSidemenuContainer makes the most sense - right?\n. This should help anyone looking to get started on this:\nThis on your template .rendered() method.\njavascript\nTracker.autorun(function() {\n  if (Session.get('width') >= 768) {\n    IonSideMenu.snapper.disable();\n    return Session.set('_showWhenSideMenuOpen', true);\n  } else {\n    IonSideMenu.snapper.enable();\n    return Session.set('_showWhenSideMenuOpen', false);\n  }\n});\nWith similar CSS to this.\n``` css\n@media (min-width: 770px) {\n  .ionic-body {\n    position: absolute;\n    overflow: visible;\n    max-width: 768px;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n  }\n.snap-content {\n    margin-left: 266px;\n    max-width: 502px;\n  }\n  .snap-content .menu-toggle-icon {\n    display: none;\n  }\n.snap-drawer-left {\n    position: absolute;\n  }\n  .snap-drawer-left .bar {\n    width: 266px;\n    right: auto;\n    left: auto;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 1026px) {\n  .ionic-body {\n    max-width: 1024px;\n  }\n.snap-content {\n    max-width: 758px;\n  }\n}\n``\n. We have.menu-toggle-icon` class on the menu button and hide it when the css swaps everything around to keep the menu open.\n. This is still happening w/ 0.1.12\n. @nickw I agree on passing that around explicitly.\n. ",

The screen that you see is a mirror of my phone's.\nIt's like the whole app is resized for the keyboard to appear under it's container. The blank space that you see, is the bottom offset and my content div's height is reduced to 0px\n. I am out for the moment, but I will research the issue and come back with more explanations asap.\nThanks a lot for the support, it's really appreciated.\n. There is a lot of problems with the current implementation of the keyboard (like re attaching the focusin listeners on each keyboard.show - remove them on hide?)\nI have been trying to port the ionic keyboard.js but it's taking a lot of time...\nHere are the problems I have right now with a really simple app:\nOn the IOS simulator:\nIf the input that is clicked on is already correctly positioned (above the zone where the keyboard appears), then everything is fine: the input is focused, keyboard appears and I can type and see what I type.\nIf the input is positioned where the keyboard appears:\nThe input is not focused (typing won't write anything inside it), therefore it is not scrolled back into view and clicking in the content of the app doesn't make the keyboard disappear (possibly a bug of the simulator, it was fine at some point).\nOn my android device\nAlready, there will be differences on the adjustment of the viewport depending if the cordova \"Fullscreen\" preference is set to true. By default, setting \"Fullscreen\" to true will cause the viewport not to resize when the softKeyboard appears, it will overlay the app container. Setting it to false will make the app container resize. I didn't find any solution to check for supporting both possibilities.\nThen having the \"Fullscreen\" preference set to false (it is the default value when building if not set), this happens:\n\n\nThe content div is squeezed up because the bottom offset of the size of the keyboard height like I tried to explain in the previous comments.\nReading through the ionic code, I noticed that they were delaying some operations because of this viewport change delay, but all in all, it is pretty confusing because the behaviour of the app changes depending on things out of my reach (sometimes all is good with ios).\nBut my biggest concern is that no one else seems to be experiencing the problems listed above. So I created a simple app repo with the exact code I have problems with: https://github.com/elGusto/kbtest\n. I have started to do that in this branch https://github.com/elGusto/meteor-ionic/tree/flow-integration\nI am at the point where I don't have any more errors with my app, but I am not using all of the templates meteoric is offering, so there is some work to do still.\nI then defined my layout like so:\n``` html\n\n  {{#ionBody}}\n    {{#ionSideMenuContainer side=\"right\"}}\n      {{#ionSideMenus}}\n        {{> sideMenuMobile}}\n      {{/ionSideMenus}}\n      {{#ionSideMenuContent}}\n        {{> ionNavBar}}\n    {{#ionNavView}}\n      {{> Template.dynamic template=main}}\n    {{/ionNavView}}\n  {{/ionSideMenuContent}}\n{{/ionSideMenuContainer}}\n\n{{/ionBody}}\n\n```\nAnd then you can do some stuff like this in the router:\njavascript\nappRoutes.route('/', {\n  name: 'home',\n  action: function() {\n    FlowLayout.render(layout, {\n      headerTitle: 'homeTitle',\n      headerButtonRight: 'menuButtonMobile',\n      headerButtonLeft: '',\n      main: 'homeMobile'\n    });\n  }\n});\n. This is really not something that can be merged like that. \nI don't think @nickw would like to let go of the iron router integration just to replace it by flow (and then the next popular router). We should restructure the package, either to make two seperate packages, one for IR, the other for FR, either we redesign to have a core package with pluggable router integretion packages (which would be the best imo in the case of new (or from MDG) router).\n. @nickw what do you think ?\nI'm happy to help with the refactoring, if you have some specific ideas let me know. I'll start working on this soon.\n. Just saw this today https://github.com/nicolaslopezj/meteor-router-layer.\nPrepare for Meteoric with router-layer on the way.\n. Do you have a fix for this ?

You can preview what I have so far on http://meteoric-contacts-list.meteor.com/\nFor reordering:\n-I added an order attribute in the database, this will require you to sort your collections\n-You'll have to pass the collection as a parameter in the ionList component \n-I am currently relying on a few classes to be apart of each list '.list' and list items '.item-content'.  I am hoping to find a cleaner way of accomplishing this(potentially  create a few more components)\nhttps://github.com/koolaid1551/contacts/commit/02e5d39ff07ddaf82183efed2a30083665cdb554#diff-70eb3c2b2e74bea5660d5b941ef44fa8\nHere's my modified repositories:\nhttps://github.com/MacNCheeze/meteor-ionic\nhttps://github.com/MacNCheeze/contacts\nLet me know if you have some other ideas how to better accomplish this.  To show hidden options I believe I am going to have to modify slip.js to reveal options beneath a list item. \n. @nickw by hidden options I mean when you swipe left you can reveal additional actions underneath each item.  For example if you check out the ionic lists(http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionList/) you can swipe left and Edit and Share buttons appear.\n. @guilhermedecampo @gregheth \nI originally built these for a prototype I was building, ultimately we decided to use angular with meteor, solely because there were a few angular libraries that we wanted to use.  This has caused me to use the Ionic framework directly and has caused my work on the list feature stop for the time being.\nOn the other hand reordering should still be working, as well as the toggling of actions on the left and right side.

    "jorjordandan": "@nickw Hey Nick, I want to try to see if I can get this sortable-deletable functionality into a state where I could submit a PR. My plan is to add an additional template called ionListButton? I was thinking I'd like the syntax to look like (inside the ionItem):\n```\n  {{#ionListButton action=\"delete\" side=\"left\"}}\n      {{>ionIcon icon=\"close-circled\"}} \n   {{/ionListButton}}\n{{#ionListButton action=\"reorder\" side=\"right\"}}\n      {{>ionIcon icon=\"drag\"}}\n    {{/ionListButton}} \n```\nThis would also allow for a single button to do both actions, e.g. \n{{#ionListButton action=\"reorder delete\" side=\"left\"}} //etc.\nthe side argument specifies which side you are toggling.\nThis is pretty well in line with how the ionic framework does it. I was planning on keeping the data-ion-list toggle on the buttons to trigger the delete/reorder states:\n<button class=\"button button-clear\" data-ion-list-toggle=\"left\">{{> ionIcon icon='ios-trash-outline'}}   \n </button>\nNo need for classes on the list item, etc... Do you think that would be a good way to do this? \nI've created a fresh fork of meteor-ionic and pulled all @MacNCheeze's code in. I'll even test it before I submit a PR this time... haha\n. @richagoel You need to be using a meteor-ionic package that supports deleting first. If you are using the latest version of the package from github, then you can follow the guide here. If you aren't using the latest version, you should clone the latest version into your package folder in your project, and add it from there. \n. You can't just use the latest version of the meteoric package - you have to use the actual package from github. The changes to add sort and delete have been added recently and the changes haven't been published to the meteor package system yet. That's why you need to use the package from git hub, and use it locally in your project.\n. Just needs to be wrapped in an afterFlush likely.\nTemplate.slideBox.rendered = function() {\n   Tracker.afterFlush(function(){\n      IonSideMenu.snapper.disable();\n  }\n};\n. Should be fixed by #269, can't replicate with the console anymore.\n. I had this twice, meteor update fixed both times.\n. I think the issue probably comes from the fact that you're using a meteor wrapper for the telerik plugin instead of regular cordova. I can't wait to be able to use WKWebviews for meteoric either, but there are probably a few wrinkles to be ironed out in both those repos. I even tried to write my own WKWebview wrapper, but got stuck at some authentication issues.... Good luck!\n. It works fine, but it's not css only.. a bit of javascript is needed to add the has-input class ... this works:\n$('.item-floating-label>input').on('keyup', function(){\n  $(this).val() ? $(this).prev().addClass('has-input') : $(this).prev().removeClass('has-input'); \n});\n. After I'm signed in the sliding works fine - probably has something to do with the useraccounts:ionic package.. I'll keep exploring....\n. for those who hit this issue I used useraccounts:ionic@=1.12.0 and that fixed it right up. I'll file an issue in their repo, but leave this open for a bit in case anyone else has the same problem.\nEDIT: 1.12.1 also works fine.\n. I thought there might be confusion with the id that's used for the path helper ( _id) .... wanted to be more explicit about which id we were talking about. But it's not really intuitive is it? I tried passing the id through an id attribute before I checked the docs, so I guess it would have been nice if that had just worked. \n. I'm going to revert that readme, I wasn't thinking about the fact that meteoric-sass is it's own package\n. Probably a good idea, since without css the spinners take up the whole page. There was no dependency listed for meteoric:ionic-sass in the package.js or versions.json - the only place I found a reference was in the guide. Did you just mean I should specify the version in the guide? Or are you adding the dependency some way that I'm not familiar with? \n. Okay I'll take care of those issues as soon as possible, thanks for the feedback!\n. Changed <div> to <i> element which fixed display issue, and matches the ionIcon tags anyways.\n. The android spinner was set up differently. All set now!\n. added the ability to pass \"both\" to the [data-ion-list-toggle] in a button, which will show the hidden buttons on both sides of the list, so that you can sort and delete at the same time.\n. Demo repo at http://reorderable_contacts.meteor.com/\n. Absolutely, thanks! I'll do both asap.\n. Hmm good question. The question actually probably belongs at the meteoric:ionic-sass github repo since that's where the scss files come from. This repo doesn't include the actual scss files. Maybe repost the question there...\n. Yeah, I think I noticed that as well. I'll submit a PR to fix it.\n. It's a bit more complicated that I thought. The issue is caused by the commit you mentioned, but when there is data from the router, then there are two contentFor blocks: one in the template, and one in the ionView. \nThe second contentFor (which turns out to be the one from the ionView template) cancels out the first, and that's why the data always overrides the parameter. To fix this, I need to figure out how to tell if a contentFor block already has any content, so I can create a condition in the ionView template. I don't know how to do that. but I'm working on it...\n. The easiest way to set up the example applications is just to clone their repos or download the zip files from their repositories, for instance the contacts repo is here. Then just run meteor. You may have to run meteor update if you get an error when you try to start them.\n. @judsonbsilva this is a pretty common problem - in my experience, just running meteor update fixes the issue. \n. No - just is there because I needed it for testing. Thought I would leave it in until the new ionic stylesheets were merged into ionic-sass, so you (or anyone) could easily verify that it's working correctly, without downloading an extra package etc.\n. it is, but if no icon is passed, the this.data.icon doesn't exist, and you can't set the default value in the helper because the data is read only .... aaaand as I was typing this I realized I could just set the default in the rendered callback... doh!\nThe icon name still has to go into the class list for the css to be applied though. I'll do that now..\n. ",

I find it to be quite a problem that I keep experiencing over and over. The item is exactly there, but is not rendered anymore, when I focus the \"invisible\" input then it will show up again. It looks like Uiwebview limitation in regards to CSS, but I fail to see any consistent pattern with this happening. Seems like padding on elements will cause it most often. Is it a common issue?

I have given Meteor 1.3 beta a spin and WkWebView eliminated these rendering problems for me. Have you tried it yet? \n.

This is because I don't see iscroll having .off for events, and I don't want that kind of memory leak even though the chance of changing events is small. I have forked iscroll and have begun \"gulpifying\" it. It is ancient and needs massive re-engineering.\n. @timbrandin Ill push a fix. This just a single param to iscroll lib.\n. @timbrandin This is actually a feature in ionic, which is called \"locking\". It defaults to true. Set it to false,\nhandlebars\n{{#ionScroll direction=\"xy\" zooming=true locking=false}}\n  <img src=\"map.png\">\n{{/ionScroll}}\nAgain, all parameters except event parameters (onscroll, onzoom) are not implemented atm.\n. ionInfiniteScroll is now implemented in my fork in my fork.

For once, this.data is read-only and shouldn't be written on:\n\nThis property provides access to the data context at the top level of the template. It is updated each time the >template is re-rendered.

Thanks man. Really appreciate it.\n. @aesmon I have created meteoric mobile website that utilized the use of keyboard heavily, but have not come across this problem. We have yet to release it to android/apple appstore though, just mobile browser.\n. @aesmon Nope. TBH, I'm only interested with the \"better testing integration\" or just testing in general. Which are external packages/modules like chimp.js, velocity, etc. Last time I checked, chimp.js have a primitive implementation of multi browser testing (hardcoded to 2). I'm just hoping that this can be truly variable next time.\n. This is solved in my fork jandres:ionic v0.1.41. See my demo.

Hello, \nI need some help in reactively adding/removing slides in ionSlideBox.\nThe functionality I'm trying to get at is something like this:\nUser can add one or more 'products'. Each product-entry is a slide. Once all these slides(products) are added, the data is finally saved. \nSo to start with, there's only 1 slide in ionSlideBox. User clicks 'plus' button and one more slide is added. \n```\n{{#ionView}}\n    {{#ionContent}}\n      {{#ionSlideBox}}\n          {{#each dynamicSlides}}\n            {{#ionSlide}}\n               Product #{{count}}\n               {{! form to accept productInfo }}\n            {{/ionSlide}}\n          {{/each}}\n      {{/ionSlideBox}}\n    {{/ionContent}}\n  {{/ionView}}  \nSession.setDefault('slideCounter', 1);\nTemplate.addProductList.helpers({\n  dynamicSlides: function() {\n    var counter = Session.get('slideCounter');\n    TempData.insert({\"count\": counter, \"productInfo\": {} });\n    return TempData.find();\n  }\n});\nTemplate.plusButton.events({\n  'click button#add-one-more': function() {\n    Session.set('slideCounter', Session.get('slideCounter') + 1);\n    TempData.insert({\"count\": Session.get('slideCounter'), \"productInfo\": {} });\n  }\n})\n```\nBut the extra slides are NOT added reactively to ionSlideBox. The view simply shows the default - \"Product #1\", although more slides (products) are getting added.\nI know something's wrong here, but I'm unable to figure it out what. Any help/pointers would be really appreciated. \nAlso, how does one use the $ionicSlideBoxDelegate equivalent methods in Meteor?\nSpecifically how/where can we use the previous(), next(), stop() etc in Meteor?\nThanks.\n. OK. after further reading into ionic-angular docs, looks like this is the answer whenever the scope changes - \n$ionicSlideBoxDelegate.update()\nWhat is the Meteor equivalent of $ionicSlideBoxDelegate.update() ?\nThank you.\n. Did anyone figure out a fix for this please? \nI realized, if you run with meteor run ios-device --production, the iOS statusbar works perfectly i.e., has the same color as the app header bar.\nBut the real problem still, is that the entire header section disappears over the top whenever the keyboard is in focus. Even the input gets pushed too far high and an empty white area is seen above the keyboard.\n. Hey @danlg \nWith Meteor 1.3, it works fine. The last version of meteoric:ionic 0.2.0 seems to fix the header going out of screen issue. The keyboard has become a lot more composed and predictable with WKWebview in 1.3.\nBut there are minor issues with the keyboard, I don't have a concrete fix, but here's what I'm doing:\nWhen keyboard shows up, and if its messing up elements above it, or creating extra space above it:\nMake sure the view is scrollable. Add 'overflow-scroll' class to ionContent if necessary. \nWhen keyboard hides but leaves behind empty space:\nJust doing $(\".content.overflow-scroll\").css(\"bottom\", \"0px\") is messing up selection picker views somewhere else in the app, so had to handle it only when the Keyboard is visible - \n```\nwindow.addEventListener('native.keyboardhide', keyboardShowHandler);\nfunction keyboardShowHandler(e){\n    Meteor.setTimeout(function(){\n         if (!cordova.plugins.Keyboard.isVisible) {\n            $(\".content.overflow-scroll\").css(\"bottom\", \"0px\")\n        }\n    }, 300)\n}\n```\nNative keyboard Left-Right Arrows on iOS - moving from field to field using these arrows sometimes makes a weird jump. I realised <form></form> around the input fields is necessary to ensure these arrows behave properly.\n. Hello @woniesong92, were you able to get this working? \n. Any info on this please? \nUsing {{> ionSpinner icon=\"ios\"}} as a template works. \nBut you can't obviously do something like \nIonSpinner.show() and IonSpinner.hide() with it. \nIs there some way of making IonModal use any of the spinners available? Thanks.\n. ",

Maybe by passing an attribute to the #ionView block helper included in those routes templates. Thoughts?\n. See here.\n. You can pass whatever data your want to modals through [data] attributes.

It is a hard issue to reproduce, but it happens once in a while. (I believe it has to do with hotcode push and cordova plugins), and so I added some validation with setTimeout on input blur to double check and remove the attribute if the keyboard is not present (not pretty but seems to be working).\nAnother issue is that sometimes when the keyboard shows up the input focus event is not fired, maybe not related but it might help some people that might be looking for this.

Is the way is works is that you have imported all the css for the ionic framework. And then you are using Blaze templates and helper files to add and remove classes from the elements to correspond to the correct function?\nSo basically it is just about dropping in the native ionic css, and then just adding and removing classes at appropriate times? \nIf not can you give me the general idea of how this package works to allow the ionic framework shown here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic to be converted to this package?\n. If you help me understand how this framework works, I will help with other components on the TODO list.\n. I took a look at Zynga Scroller. Do we want to integrate this package? Should I integrate ion-scroll and then ion-refresher? since one depends on the other?\nOr do you recommend finding another package?\n. Ah this is true, rubber band scrolling works on the device. thank you. \n. I got it to work with slightly different syntax. \nHere is what worked:\n{{#contentFor \"headerButtonRight\"}}\n    <button class=\"button button-clear\" data-ion-modal=\"_contactsNew\">{{> ionIcon icon=\"ios-loop-strong\"}}</button>\n{{/contentFor}}\n. actually sorry i need to test on the device.

Ok I figured this out.\nIn order to add a callback to the slideBox slides do the following:\n```\n Template.slideBox.onRendered(function () {\n  $('.ion-slide-box').on('swipe', function(event, slick, direction){\n    console.log(direction);\n  });\n$('.ion-slide-box').on('beforeChange', function(event, slick, currentSlide, nextSlide){\n    console.log(nextSlide);\n   });\n }) \n```\nYou can also call:\n$('.ion-slide-box').slick('slickCurrentSlide') //current slide index, great for showing and hiding links\nand\n$('.ion-slide-box').slick('slickPrev') // previous slide\n  $('.ion-slide-box').slick('slickNext') //next slide\nCan we update to documentation and add this to it?\nThanks for pointing me in the right direction.\n.

    "jon-grangien": "Hi. I don't know if there's a better solution, but I was able to do it for my scenario by calling IonSideMenu.snapper.disable(). Disabling the snapper only actually disables the drag functionality for the side bar, but if you do it as you're routing to a page that doesn't have the header button for it, it's inaccessible.\nSo I'm making an app where a logged out user only has access to a login page and a signup page. I don't want a sidebar available here. The layout template is called appLayout, and in its js file:\njavascript\nTemplate.appLayout.rendered = function () {\n  if ((Router.current().route.getName() === 'signup') ||\n     (Router.current().route.getName() === 'login')) {\n    // console.log(\"turning off side menu\");\n    IonSideMenu.snapper.disable();\n  }\n};\nsignup and login are the templates and route names for the two pages a logged out user gets.\nAlso where I'm handling the logout functionality:\njavascript\nMeteor.logout(function(error) {\n  if(error) {\n      //display error\n      console.log(\"logout error: \" + error);\n  } else {\n      IonSideMenu.snapper.disable(); //disable side bar\n      Router.go('/login');\n  }\n});\nThis disables the side bar as the login and signup pages are loaded.\nAnd then, because the page the router routes to as a user is logged in (and should start being able to access the side bar) is called tasks, I enable it again for this page. It's now enabled for any other page the user would go to except when logging back out to the login/signup pages. The if-statement isn't necessary here\njavascript\nTemplate.tasks.rendered = function () {\n  if (Router.current().route.getName() === 'tasks') {\n    // console.log(\"turning on side menu\");\n    IonSideMenu.snapper.enable();\n  }\n};\nI should probably add an if-statement that checks if it's disabled first before enabling it there.\nThat works, anyway.

When I add the package locally, I had to hard-code _id = \"123456\" instead of _id=teamId + template helpers, otherwise _id is null (similar for path and title). With the previous release version (0.1.17), template helpers worked. So I thought it might be a file loading order problem. Please correct me and/or show me the right way to do this if I'm wrong.\n. Embarrassing but I found it was a local function in the same .js file prevent the file to be properly loaded. After removing that function, everything works just fine now. \nAgain, thanks a lot for the fix! \n. hmm... I was using currentData() in Line 46 when I said \"everything works just fine\". After I switched back to parentData(1), one click on the tab only does the routing, and a 2nd click on the same tab is needed to switch it to active. Refreshing the page would also remove active from the tab. So I think Line 46 might still need a fix. \nThis is tested with chrome dev tool in both ios and android devices, not with emulators though. And you said you didn't have similar issue?\n. I added some console logs in ionTabs.js Line 38 and Line 45 if blocks and found the following:\nIn my case, with just 1 click on the tab, the if check in Line 38 always fails and the Line 45 if is relied upon to set the tab to active, and then I'm facing the parentData() issue. This happened with both 'non-complex' paths like '/post' and 'complex' ones like '/post/:_id'.\nTo be more detailed, say I have \njavascript\n// parentData() in Line 46\n// {{> ionTab title='Post' path='post'}}\n// Route 'post': {path: 'post/:_id'}\n- 1st click on the Post tab: this.data is 'post', and ionTabCurrent is /post/123456, the Line 38 iffails and Line 46 doesn't work, so the tab is not active at this time.\n- 2nd click on the Post tab: both this.data and ionTabCurrent is 'post' and Line 38 passes. Tab is then set to active. \nSo in my case, the Line 46 fix is necessary to allow 1-click switching-on. Maybe in your case Line 38 passes with 1 click and it never goes to Line 45?\n. Thanks!\n. ",

Hi @nickw, does that mean that there is no maintainer for this package anymore? My guess is that most Meteor users don't want to go the Angular way (Blaze and React seem the most popular).\n. OK, that's good to know. We are using meteoric for an MVP now, but will have to plan for something else later on then.\nWhat are you using personally for mobile (cordova powered) apps based on Meteor? Is there anything for Blaze that you know?\n. @nickw cool thanks, time to learn React :)\n. I have the same situation, and I played a bit around with reapp. My conclusion is that it is still far from ready for production. It would be cool if there would be a react-ionic library, but what I found so far is very basic.\n\nWhat we are doing now is porting our app slowly to react, but keeping ionic. So step by step we port one of the components in meteor-ionic to a react version of it. All the stuff we don't need we won't implement (yet).\nIt's not that difficult and the meteor-ionic package is a great starting point for implementing a react-ionic version of it.\n. For anyone who is interested (and prefers React over Blaze), I created a port of Meteoric for React, see https://github.com/pors/reactionic/. It should be quite easy to port your apps as I tried to keep it as much as possible in line with Meteoric. Let me know if I can help!\nDemo is here: http://pors.github.io/reactionic/#demo\n. ",

It's definitely a problem with meteoric-ionic.\n. Figured out the source of the issue on my end. In components/ionKeyboard.js, there's a function call that actually disables keyboard scrolling on startup.\nMeteor.startup(function () {\n  if (Meteor.isCordova) {\n    IonKeyboard.disableScroll();\n  }\n});\nI wrote a custom implementation of meteoric-ionic that simply comments out this line, and it fixed the issue for me. The IonKeyboard object is attached to the window object, so if you want to save yourself the trouble of creating your own custom package, you can probably just call \"this.IonKeyboard.enableScroll()\" in a Meteor.onRendered call or something similar. \nI'm curious as to why this is here in the first place - is the intended behavior for us to enable scrolling in our own startup function?

That's what I figured.  We're just using a regular route to get to a view that looks like a modal and then going from there.  The direction that things sweep in/out, up/down is something we may try to tweak further down the road.\n. Things are very basic right now.  I haven't looked at Meteor Hunt, but have been following the Guide and code for the demo of all components.\nHere are a few files that I'm working with -- https://gist.github.com/gbhatnag/15892feb6004ad6b6eeb\nHope there's something simple I'm missing that'll get the navigation transitions working as expected.

    "1seck": "Hello,\nWe are tracking down the error right now.\nBut since we found out that the demo app of meteoric is running correctly\nin 9.1 it is probably a bug on our side.\nSeems like one has to be very precise about the structure of ionView,\nionNavview, ionContent and such and also it would be advisable to deploy to\nthe iPhone during the development process and not only to test on\nemulator/browser.\nAm Donnerstag, 10.
