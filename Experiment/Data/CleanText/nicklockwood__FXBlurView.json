    "nicklockwood": "Whoops! Thanks :-)\n. It's probably because it uses [layer renderInContext:] which doesn't work with opengl content, instead of the equivalent iOS7 [view <redacted>] method which should work with anything.\nBut to be honest, if you're just targeting iOS7 and above, you'd be better off using the UIToolbar layer trick to do your blurring instead (google it).\nFor SpriteKit content, there may be an approach using shaders or CIFilters that would be more efficient (not 100% sure as I've not read much of the SpriteKit docs yet).\n. I can't see that they'd have a problem with it. It doesn't use any private APIs.\n. Failing that though, if you modify the library to use the aforementioned new iOS 7 method (should be obvious - it's a one-line change) then it should solve your issue.\n. I tried to implement the new iOS 7 layer drawing method conditionally in the latest release, but it doesn't seem to work. Did you have any luck with it?\n. Given that this is the standard behaviour for all views anyway, is there any particular reason why BlurView should change the default? It's easily overridden either in code or within the nib, and it's not obvious to me that blurViews are more likely to be non-interactive than interactive (if anything I'd guess the opposite).\n. Ah, sorry. I should probably check my pull requests more often.\nI've implemented tintColor in the latest release 1.3. It's not nearly as flexible as your implementation, but I was trying to avoid too much in the way of configuration surface area.\nI believe the effect when setting tintColor to [UIColor whiteColor] is pretty close to what you have in your screenshot.  I'm aware that tintColor is now a standard property iOS7, but I kind of consider this a feature rather than an unintended side effect (I've handled support for setting it in IB).\nWould be insterested in further discussion though - it looks like I might want to cherry-pick some of the stuff in this pull request, but I'll need to wrap my head around exactly what it all does :-)\n. In theory I should just be able to use drawViewHeirarchyInRect: on iOS7 although it didn't work when I tried it.\n. That should have been fixed in the latest point release. If not, can you tell me what settings you are using?\n. I think the problem may be iPad-specific. I'll investigate further.\n. Btw, a tint of [UIColor whiteColor] works just as well ;-)\n. Fixed in 1.4.4\n. FXBlurView works by taking a snaphot of the superview contents. Even if I were to capture the whole window, I'm not aware of any public API that would let you capture the desktop, so I don't think there's any way to make this work.\n. I think this is out of scope for what the library is trying to achieve.\nAre you aware of the layer.mask property? That can be used to mask and view using the contents of another view with only a few lines of code and without needing explicit support to be built into the library.\nFor example, you could just assign the star image as the contents of an image view, then use it as the mask, e.g.\nUIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:starImage];\nblurView.layer.mask = imageView.layer;\n. I think it happens when your view has a size of zero. I thought I'd fixed it, but apparently not.\nTry ensuring that your FXBlurView frame is set before you add it to the screen.\n. Hmm. Okay, I'll investigate further. If you can reproduce it with a simple project then that would be a big help.\n. I've fixed this in 1.3.3.\n. oh, that's odd. OK, I'll try again.\n. The documentation for CGRectIsEmpty says that it should return YES if the width OR height are zero. Is it possible that something else is going wrong?\n. OK, I can't reproduce this in 1.4. If you're still seeing it, please send me a sample project.\n. The short answer is no.\nIt's a limitation of the renderInContext: method used to capture the view contents. iOS7 has a new method for capturing view contents that would also work with AVPlayer, but it's too slow for realtime use.\n. It is possible to capture the contents of an AVPlayer as an image, although I don't recall the mechanism off the top of my head. If you feel like figuring out that part, I can show you how to integrate it with FXBlurView.\n. It is mentioned in the README, under FAQs:\nQ. My SpriteKit/OpenGL/Video/3D transformed content isn't showing up properly when placed underneath an FXBlurView, why not?\nA. This is a limitation of a the CALayer renderInContext: method used to capture the view contents. There is no workaround for this on iOS 6 and earlier. On iOS 7 you can make use of the UIView drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates: method to capture an view and apply the blur effect yourself, but this it too slow for realtime use, so FXBlurView does not use this method by default.\n. It may do. I included AVPlayerLayer in the list of special cases, but in practice you may find the performance is too bad to be usable.\n. FXBlurView only works with views inside your app, not with the iOS homescreen parallax effect. This is a limitation imposed by iOS.\nYou can blur the homescreen using a UIToolbar instead on iOS7.\n. This seems like a neat approach. Would be good to have support for other view types such as movie players though. I probably won't merge this exactly as implemented, but I'll look at providing something similar in the next version.\n. Ah, yeah I know why that's happening. I think a fix may be possible. I'll see what I can do.\n. Unfortunately the fix I had it mind doesn't seem to work. All I can suggest is that you animate the text position using an NSTimer or CADisplayLink instead of Core Animation.\n. I don't see any easy way to do this with good performance. You do a trick by generating the blurView for the whole superview area and then shifting it around inside a container when you animate (as in the modal example) but I don't see a good way to generalise this technique.\n. That does sound pretty neat. It's a little bit out if scope for what I'm trying to do with FXBlurview, but I'll think about it.\n. Ha ha, all good points. I'll fix it in the next update.\n. Fixed in 1.4.2\n. Thanks. What are the exact dimensions of the white view and blurview instance you are using? And can you describe the view hierarchy? Is the blurView a child of the white view or its sibling?\n. Never mind, I was able to reproduce it. Fixed in version 1.4.2.\n. I overwrote previous tag. Naughty, but I'm pretty sure nobody but you would've updated yet ;-)\n. Probably. Sorry, I haven't had a chance to fully review it yet (many libs to maintain).\n. I've included this fix in the 1.5 release.\n. BlurViews probably don't work right inside a scrollview. You should be able to fix it by placing them inside a subview within the scrollview.\n. Well basically it works by capturing a snapshot of the visible area of the containing view. When you scroll a scroll view, the visible area changes but the blurview won't get redrawn unless it is operating in dynamic mode.\nYou could just tell the blurview to update whenever the scroll view scrolls, but that will probably perform worse than if the blur view is dynamic.\nAnother option might be to set dynamic=true on the blurviews when the scroll view starts moving and then toggle it off again when the scrollview has come to a stop.\nShould be ok on a tableView, but you may need to update the blurview whenever you recycle the cell.\n. you need to set self.clipsToBounds = YES or self.layer.masksToBounds = YES. Also, it would be a good idea to call  [super awakeFromNib] in case FXBlurView overrides that method in future.\n. Umm no. Implicit property synthesis is a great, and long awaited feature of Objective C. Turning on a compiler warning for it is just creating Shit Work for yourself, and suppressing that warning is self-defeating.\nIf I did want to disable auto-synthesis, the correct approach would be to add explicit @synthesize statements for those properties. But I don't want to.\nIf you must use this warning, I suggest you use a static compiled version of FXBlurView, or something like Cocoapods.\n. This isn't needed - it can already be compiled using the iOS 6 SDK just fine.\n. It works fine if you compile using Xcode 4.6.3 - I guess it's due to the stricter compiler in Xcode 5. OK, I'll take a look.\n. OK, fixed.\n. Can you provide an example project demonstrating the problem? I'm unclear what you mean, as FXBlurView should not care about the screen orientation, and I'm concerned your fix might be specific to a particular use-case.\n. Wow, that is interesting (and deeply disturbing). Is there a workaround?\n. Btw, @alfiehanssen, if you're just targeting iOS7, why not use a regular UIToolbar instead of FXBlurView?\n. Try using the global [FXBlurView setBlurEnabled:] methods to disable the blur during animation, rather than toggling the dynamic property.\nWhen using scrollView delegate methods to update the blur view, make sure you use the async option.\n. I've included this fix in the 1.5 release.\n. Try disabling dynamic mode, and instead call update on the blur view from the scrollviewDidScroll delegate method.\n. FXBlurView doesn't blur it's subviews, it only blurs the contents of its superview.\n. Sorry, I think I misunderstood you. You just need to move FXBlurView to the front of your view hierarchy. Right now it's behind all the views you want it to blur. If you move it in front of them (which means moving it down in the list in interface builder) it should work.\n. What is the purpose of the displayIfNeeded code?\nI would guess this is why it isn't working as it is causing the blurview to draw itself before the view hierarchy has finished drawing (and then it won't be updated once it finishes because dynamic is set to NO).\n. It looks like that code may have been copied from the modal example. If you are trying to create a sliding overlay effect then it may be needed, but you need to be careful that you delay triggering it until after the view has fully appeared on screen.\nIf you are not trying to create a sliding overlay, you don't need that code.\n. Interesting. I guess I could add that fix to the snapshot logic itself (I already hide other blur views, etc). But maybe it's worth waiting to see what happens with iOS 7.1, as you say.\n. Unfortunately it's not possible to use FXBlurView with animations in this way. It will work if you scroll the scrollView by setting the animated: argument to YES, but not using UIView animation. This has to do with the way that iOS updates views when animating.\n. It's not possible to fix this due to the way Core Animation works. The animations happens in a separate process, so I can't get snapshots of the intermediate frames. If you need this, you'll have to implement your animation using a timer.\n. Ha ha, fair enough. This actually increases the total LOC if course, which was my reason for not doing it originally, but I suppose that it is better despite that.\nNice catch on the missing completion call too - dunno how I missed that!\n. To fix the corner radius, you just need to enable clipsToBounds on your blurview.\nThe incompatibility with NGAParallaxMotion probably relates to how that library works. If it uses core animation, FXBlurView can't capture the animation unfortunately.\n. Disable blur and then set blurview.layer.contents = nil. That will hide the blurred contents temporarily, and it will come back when you re-enable blur.\n. not a bug, just the way that the tint colour is applied. I use additive instead of subtractive blending, so any colour + zero (black) == original colour.\nIf you overlay a black subview with partial transparency on top or inside the blur view, you should get the effect you wanted.\n. I'm unclear what the point of this is?\n. Did you read the section about ARC in the README.md file? Here it is:\nARC Compatibility\nAs of version 1.3, FXBlurView requires ARC. If you wish to use FXBlurView in a non-ARC project, just add the -fobjc-arc compiler flag to the FXBlurView.m class. To do this, go to the Build Phases tab in your target settings, open the Compile Sources group, double-click FXBlurView.m in the list and type -fobjc-arc into the popover.\nIf you wish to convert your whole project to ARC, comment out the #error line in FXBlurView.m, then run the Edit > Refactor > Convert to Objective-C ARC... tool in Xcode and make sure all files that you wish to use ARC for (including FXBlurView.m) are checked.\n. These should now be fixed in version 1.6. If you are still seeing them, please let me know.\n. Yep, rookie error on my part - thanks!\n. I already did - v 1.5.5 includes this fix.\n. You can blur an image using the UIImage category included with the library.\n. Oh, I see. The simplest option would just be to put your button or imageview inside an FXBlurView, with a transparent background for your button.\nFXBlurView doesn't work with camera input. For that you'll need to try something like GPUImage.\n. Hi, can you check if version 1.6 solves this problem for you? I made some changes to the capture offset logic.\n. Yeah, that's quite possible.There are various steps you can take to reduce this:\n- If the content behind the blur view doesn't change, set dynamic = NO\n- If the content changes only infrequently, increase the updateInterval to something like 0.1 (10 frames per second)\n- Try reducing the number of blue iterations and see if the quality is still acceptable\n- If the content behind is a scrollview, set dynamic = NO and use the scrollView delegate's didScroll method to update the blurView instead\n. Did you close this because you found a workaround, or because the problem wasn't related to blur view?\n. It doesn't improve performance. There is no fast path from screenshots -> OpenGL texture, so converting the image for use with GPUImage actually takes long than the blur function.\n. That seems likely. FXBlurView doesn't capture the presentationLayer, only the modelLayer, so any animations happening behind it are not correctly included.\nI have yet to find a workaround for this unfortunately. Trying to capture the presentationLayer leads to other bugs, such as content in front of the blurView appearing in the blurred image.\n. FXBurView is constantly creating images and releasing them. There's not really any way to avoid that, except by disabling dynamic mode.\nFor best performance, disable dynamic mode and only update the blur effect when the content behind it changes. If the content scrolls, the best way to do that is to update the blur from the scrollViewDidScroll delegate method.\n. You can achieve this by just adding a subview inside your blurview with a translucent background.\n. I would be surprised if you can detect any performance impact from adding that subview, and the rendering should actually be more efficient, since view background colours are composited on the GPU instead of using software drawing.\n. I'm going to need a little more information. Can you provide a stack trace from the crash? And also, if possible try to find out what the dimensions of the blurView were at the time to crashed.\n. Those should be the same, except when animating (which doesn't work in dynamic mode).\n. Yes, that's expected behaviour. FXBlurView only captures the contents of the view itself, not any colours showing through from the view behind.\nIf you set the underlyingView property of the FXBlurView to the view that contains your partially transparent view, it should solve the problem.\n. No. The FXBlurView has a property called \"underlyingView\". If this is nil, it defaults to the view containing the FXBlurView, however you can set this to a view of your choosing, including views that are not in the same hierarchy as the blur view.\n. It's just a property of the FXBlurView class. If you have an outlet to your blurView in your view controller, you'd just write:\nself.myBlurView.underlyingView = someOtherView;\n. You've most likely declared the outlet as being of type UIView * instead of FXBlurView . Either change the outlet declaration to FXBlurView , or cast the call, like this:\n((FXBlurView *)self.Genres).underlyingView = _main_view;\n. Maybe change the backgroundColor of _main_view to white?\n. FXBlurView doesn't work over camera output, or certain other cases (e.g. OpenGL views, SpriteKit, etc). This is an iOS limitation.\n. When you say it doesn't work, what is it doing, and what did you expect it to do?\n. I'm pretty sure that adding an observer creates a weak reference to the object, and doesn't prevent it from being deallocated.\nI'd be interested if you have any evidence to the contrary.\n. The trace doesn't mention NSNotificationCenter anywhere - also, that seems to be the trace for the allocations tab, not the leaks tab - are you sure it's FXBlurView that's leaking? (I'm not saying it isn't - just that that output doesn't seem to prove it).\n. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n. I already tried it. The performance is much worse when using the new snapshot APIs.\n. It's because you are calling the animation immediately after inserting the subview. This is a known bug/feature in Core Animation that animations don't work if they are applied to a view before it has appeared on screen.\nThe workaround is to delay your animation by a single frame, which you can do like this:\n_blurEffectView = [[FXBlurView alloc] initWithFrame:self.superview.bounds];\n_blurEffectView.tintColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.1 green:0.1 blue:0.1 alpha:1];\n[self.superview insertSubview:_blurEffectView belowSubview:self];\ndispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.5 animations:^{\n        _blurEffectView.blurRadius = 30;\n    }];\n})\nYeah, it's a bit hacky, but hey, Objective-C ;-)\n. Fixed in 1.6.4\n. The performance will be horrible if you are trying to make each cell in your table into a separate blur view. The right way to do this is to make the cells transparent and put the blur view behind the table.\n. This is a known (documented) issue. The solution you've found will work, but the performance is slower for live updates.\n. It should be faster, but when I tried it I found that the performance with drawViewHierarchy was disastrously slow. I haven't tested it on iOS8 though, so it may have improved.\n. FXBlurView blurs its parent and siblings, not its child views.\n. This is hugely expensive. You're basically always capturing the full screen every time even if your blurview is only a few pixels in size.\n. Try capturing the screenshot using -[UIView drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:] instead.\n. \ud83d\udc4d. I think the problem is that FXBlurView hides subviews automatically when snapshotting, then re-shows them. I guess it should kee track of which ones were already hidden.\n. Whoops! Thanks :-)\n. It's probably because it uses [layer renderInContext:] which doesn't work with opengl content, instead of the equivalent iOS7 [view <redacted>] method which should work with anything.\nBut to be honest, if you're just targeting iOS7 and above, you'd be better off using the UIToolbar layer trick to do your blurring instead (google it).\nFor SpriteKit content, there may be an approach using shaders or CIFilters that would be more efficient (not 100% sure as I've not read much of the SpriteKit docs yet).\n.

Yeah, that's quite possible.There are various steps you can take to reduce this:\n- If the content behind the blur view doesn't change, set dynamic = NO\n- If the content changes only infrequently, increase the updateInterval to something like 0.1 (10 frames per second)\n- Try reducing the number of blue iterations and see if the quality is still acceptable\n- If the content behind is a scrollview, set dynamic = NO and use the scrollView delegate's didScroll method to update the blurView instead\n. Did you close this because you found a workaround, or because the problem wasn't related to blur view?\n. It doesn't improve performance. There is no fast path from screenshots -> OpenGL texture, so converting the image for use with GPUImage actually takes long than the blur function.\n. That seems likely. FXBlurView doesn't capture the presentationLayer, only the modelLayer, so any animations happening behind it are not correctly included.\nI have yet to find a workaround for this unfortunately. Trying to capture the presentationLayer leads to other bugs, such as content in front of the blurView appearing in the blurred image.\n. FXBurView is constantly creating images and releasing them. There's not really any way to avoid that, except by disabling dynamic mode.\nFor best performance, disable dynamic mode and only update the blur effect when the content behind it changes. If the content scrolls, the best way to do that is to update the blur from the scrollViewDidScroll delegate method.\n. You can achieve this by just adding a subview inside your blurview with a translucent background.\n. I would be surprised if you can detect any performance impact from adding that subview, and the rendering should actually be more efficient, since view background colours are composited on the GPU instead of using software drawing.\n. I'm going to need a little more information. Can you provide a stack trace from the crash? And also, if possible try to find out what the dimensions of the blurView were at the time to crashed.\n. Those should be the same, except when animating (which doesn't work in dynamic mode).\n. Yes, that's expected behaviour. FXBlurView only captures the contents of the view itself, not any colours showing through from the view behind.\nIf you set the underlyingView property of the FXBlurView to the view that contains your partially transparent view, it should solve the problem.\n. No. The FXBlurView has a property called \"underlyingView\". If this is nil, it defaults to the view containing the FXBlurView, however you can set this to a view of your choosing, including views that are not in the same hierarchy as the blur view.\n. It's just a property of the FXBlurView class. If you have an outlet to your blurView in your view controller, you'd just write:\nself.myBlurView.underlyingView = someOtherView;\n. You've most likely declared the outlet as being of type UIView * instead of FXBlurView . Either change the outlet declaration to FXBlurView , or cast the call, like this:\n((FXBlurView *)self.Genres).underlyingView = _main_view;\n. Maybe change the backgroundColor of _main_view to white?\n. FXBlurView doesn't work over camera output, or certain other cases (e.g. OpenGL views, SpriteKit, etc). This is an iOS limitation.\n. When you say it doesn't work, what is it doing, and what did you expect it to do?\n. I'm pretty sure that adding an observer creates a weak reference to the object, and doesn't prevent it from being deallocated.\nI'd be interested if you have any evidence to the contrary.\n. The trace doesn't mention NSNotificationCenter anywhere - also, that seems to be the trace for the allocations tab, not the leaks tab - are you sure it's FXBlurView that's leaking? (I'm not saying it isn't - just that that output doesn't seem to prove it).\n. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n. I already tried it. The performance is much worse when using the new snapshot APIs.\n. It's because you are calling the animation immediately after inserting the subview. This is a known bug/feature in Core Animation that animations don't work if they are applied to a view before it has appeared on screen.\nThe workaround is to delay your animation by a single frame, which you can do like this:\n_blurEffectView = [[FXBlurView alloc] initWithFrame:self.superview.bounds];\n_blurEffectView.tintColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.1 green:0.1 blue:0.1 alpha:1];\n[self.superview insertSubview:_blurEffectView belowSubview:self];\ndispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.5 animations:^{\n        _blurEffectView.blurRadius = 30;\n    }];\n})\nYeah, it's a bit hacky, but hey, Objective-C ;-)\n. Fixed in 1.6.4\n. The performance will be horrible if you are trying to make each cell in your table into a separate blur view. The right way to do this is to make the cells transparent and put the blur view behind the table.\n. This is a known (documented) issue. The solution you've found will work, but the performance is slower for live updates.\n. It should be faster, but when I tried it I found that the performance with drawViewHierarchy was disastrously slow. I haven't tested it on iOS8 though, so it may have improved.\n. FXBlurView blurs its parent and siblings, not its child views.\n. This is hugely expensive. You're basically always capturing the full screen every time even if your blurview is only a few pixels in size.\n. Try capturing the screenshot using -[UIView drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:] instead.\n. \ud83d\udc4d. I think the problem is that FXBlurView hides subviews automatically when snapshotting, then re-shows them. I guess it should kee track of which ones were already hidden.\n. ",
