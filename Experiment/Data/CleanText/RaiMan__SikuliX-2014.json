    "RaiMan": "Thanks for your contribution.\nYou might notice, that I made some adaptions though (docs and sources optional)\n. thanks for the fix.\nSince I moved the optional libVisionProxy build to the Libs module now, I will integrate it there.\n. I had to revert the fix in the JythonScriptRunner:\nit MUST be \n\"from sikuli import *\",\nsince we import a Python module folder (Lib/sikuli) and not only Sikuli.py\nBTW: your import is in init.py and executed as the first import\n. I am on the way, to get it working again.\nI will give you a note from here, when it makes sense to fork/download again.\n-r: I noticed already\nlibs folder: fixed already.\nimport sikuli: ok thanks.\n. I think I have fixed the most obvious problems (but only tested on Mac ;-)\nYou should carefully read through the main README, where I have changed and added some information.\nThe module Libs has an option to build a libVisionProxy.so, that will be used when running in the Maven context if successfully built.\n. ... Maybe it's not any use to do anything to the c++ bits\n... not really:\n- the Tesseract part is not touched yet \n. Thanks for this contribution.\nI will add a SikuliX Maven repo here too.\n. Thanks again.\nI will now start to test/develop on Windows 8.\nDo you have any suggestions, how to run the native builds from command line (having installed the freely available MS Visual Studio tools and other stuff needed) using the project files like the one you have provided for WinUtil.dll?\n. Thanks - exactly what I need.\n. Wooow, that's really great. Many thanks for the PATH improvement. I will adapt it, so that the libs path finally taken is added (not necessary home folder, preferably the location of the running Sikuli jar).\nThe WinUtil change is not necessary: At startup (no matter what environment or run setup) on Mac and Windows the libs xxxUtil are loaded at the time, when the ResourceLoader checks the availability of a suitable libs folder. I will reduce your fix to an explaining comment.\nYou input is really*3 appreciated: I do not have the time and not the general experience to dive down to the last possible improvement, so I am very happy with every input ... and yours rocks ;-) \n. Sorry, but since the pull #8 cannot be auto-merged, I added the dependency exclusion manually in my local repo.\nSo I leave the resynch to you ;-)\n. ok, thanks. worked.\n. Thanks, I will check and fix it.\n. using USERPROFILE now.\nthanks\n. just delete the libs folder, so it can be recreated including jawt.dll at next run.\nfixed in version 1.1.0\n. will be available with version 1.1.0.\nThanks.\n. Thanks for pointing out. Did not realize that until now, but it only happens, if you are not using the provided command files and not adding the respective path yourself after setup and before using Sikuli the first time (e.g. directly using the jar files\nI will report an according bug on launchpad.\nVersion 1.1.0 will not do that anymore, but dynamically add the path to the environment at runtime and not touch the registry anymore.\n. Hi Roman,\nI again added the fixes manually, supposing that your merge \"merged from upstream\" synchronised with my master.\nI am sure now being on the level of your commit 4db6783bbd (the fixes in Sikuli-IDE.jar I have integrated, but somewhat modified, since I worked in that area in parallel) \nTo get out of this \"bad loop\" I suggest, to \n- delete your current fork\n- make a new fork of my master\n- from then on work in the master branch (do not create branches with the intention to get them merged with my master - this will not work. You would first have to merge into your master, so it makes no sense) \n- this will allow you to create pull requests from one or more commits in the future.\n. Thanks, I will have a look at it later.\nAs you might have noticed: the IDE support is ready and tested on Mac and Windows.\nI totally revised the build/pack/setup process based on the SikuliX Repo:\nTo get a folder SikuliX-Setup in the parent folder of the repo, you now have to simply run\ncollectjars(.bat)\nin the root level of the repo.\nThis already works with a freshly downloaded repo. (tested on Mac and Windows).\nSikuliX-Repo is exactly the same as when having prepared for an offline setup.\n. Thanks - looks good.\nI will add an option to select the scripting language if more than one is setup, otherwise take the one that is installed.\n. For with usage the region must be created on the script level (which is not the case for the App class).\nJust use casting: \nwith Region(app.window()):\n. @topher200 \nThanks. Done.. Thanks.\n. Sorry, simply forgot it.\n. To the decoding of the given color value I will add toUppercase (allows \"Blue\" also) and #XXXXXX (HTML hex RGB colours) and #nnnnnnnnn (3 int values to form RGB color value)\nThanks for contribution.\n. This is currently implemented as a Python script\nin this repo: Jython/src/main/resources/scripts/sikuli2html.py\nJust run this script on commandline using Jython/Python and take care, that the absolute filename of the respective .sikuli folder is in sys.argv.\nSince currently sys.argv handling in the above script is commented out (switched off), you have to use a copy, that has the lines 200 and 201 uncommented, so they execute and accept sys.argv.\n. if you downloaded the latest sikuli-setup.jar from launchpad, then this should not reclaim any Dropbox connections.\nAbout how to use offline setup:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli/+faq/2363\n. since the current build of libVisionProxy is dynamic, on other machines you need the dependencies at least compatible at the level of the dynamic calls (OpenCV, Tesseract, image support modules, C-libs).\nThat is exactly, what is done for the Windows and Mac packages: they contain all native libs needed.\nI am on the way, to do the same for Linux starting with Ubuntu.\nIf you know how to do, you might try, to build a static version of libVisionProxy, that contains all dependencies. I will try this concept too during the next weeks.\n. will be better supported with 1.1.0\n. The SikuliX Settings/Preferences handling is a (inherited ;-) mess.\nTo completely revise this and offer more options in a consistent way is on the list for version 1.2\nThe tessdata folder location is evaluated at startup of SikuliX (e.g. at the first use of new Screen(), when using the Java API).\nThis includes the export of the tessdata folder (if available) to libs/tessdata from the sikulixapi.jar.\nThe folder location (absolute path) is then stored in org.sikuli.basics.Settings.OcrDataPath for later use at OCR initialization (first use of a Region.text()).\nSo as a workaround, you might do this:\nScreen s = new Screen(); // Sikuli initialization\norg.sikuli.basics.Settings.OcrDataPath = \"your path from ENV variable\"\n\u2026.\n// first use of text find/read function: your tessdata folder path will be used\n. no longer relevant currently. will be available in version 1.2.\n. thanks.\n. Thanks for finding, but this patch only corrects the symptom.\nI have fixed the fact, that the running script did not have ending .py, but ending .null, which finally led to the problem in findErrorSource (the location of your fix).\nplease check again with my fix\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/commit/d772bbf75b162c51503324e62e9ddbdafa6ee60b\nThe assumption \"forIDE has 2 elements\" should be correct now with this fix.\n. Fixed the problem more generally.\nThanks for finding.\n. ok, thanks.\n. Thanks.\n. Region.findText() is not finally tested yet.\nWhat happens if you use Region.find() instead?\n. There seem to be problems on Windows XP/7 with the native libs WinUtil.dll and VisionProxy.dll.\nSo this might be the cause here.\nSo you either find out about the problem or you stop using findText() ;-)\n. should be ok now with latest 1.1.0\n. I am sorry, but on Windows 7 and XP there seem to be generally some problems with the native libraries I produced on Windows 8.\nI did not fix the problem yet.\n. Was the fine one running with some 64-Bit Java? \n. Did not realize, that something like that is missing ;-)\nThanks.\n. rubocop: interesting\n. fantastic \ufffc: -) \ufffc\ufffc\nWhere did you get the correct link name? What tool did you use?\n. ok, dependencywalker is what I use. Might be a problem with the Windows 8.1 I am using to build the stuff.\nI will check it the next days. Thanks.\n. You are here with SikuliX version 1.1.0-Beta1.\nThis is not yet on Maven (and no version of it has ever been before).\nOn Maven you have Sikuli Java API, which is to some extent feature compatible, but is a totally different package and available on Maven.\nProject homepage: https://code.google.com/p/sikuli-api/\n. Thanks, good idea not to crash the IDE in this case ;-)\n. sorry - lost out of focus ;-)\n. Totally understood.\nI have to check. Thanks\n. could you please on a command line run either\nrunsikulix(.cmd) -d 3 -c\nor\njava -jar sikulix.jar -Dsikuli.Debug=3 -Dsikuli.console=false\nand run your test again\nand send me the command line output silently to my mail (see my page https://github.com/RaiMan)\n. Should be fixed with nightly build: 1.1.0-Beta3 2014-07-14_01:00nightly (European time)\nthanks for cooperation.\n. Since I said 1.1.0-Beta3 2014-07-14_01:00nightly  (European time) I confirm, that you should still have the same issue with 1.1.0-Beta3 2014-07-13_01:00nightly. \nImplemented the fixes only a few hours ago.\n... so you still have to wait a few hours. \n. see my private answer. all the best.\n. Download and setup from http://nightly.sikuli.de (Beta3)\nand run the script from command line using \n-d 3 -r your-script.sikuli\nthis might reveal more debug information.\nsend the relevant part of the log to my mail at https://github.com/RaiMan\nSince this is only happening with this one test (as I understand):\nWhat is different against the others? \nAny parallel actions/processes, that might influence the mouse handling?\n. Ok, you do not need to switch to Beta3 now, if things are working for you with Beta2.\nYes a debug from Beta2 would be sufficient for now.\nAt first glance, this seems to be a Java Robot problem. What Java is running?\n. Ok, I made some research in the net.\nI have removed a Robot.waitforidle() after the mouseDown in the SikuliX DesktopRobot.\nThis will be available to test with the nightly build \n1.1.0-Beta3 2014-07-15_01:00nightly (European time)\nSo you might tomorrow switch one VM to Beta3 and run your test to see what happens.\n. I just started to schedule some some long running click tests (not yet in my Win7-32 VM).\nThe information wether a click is successful or not, is currently not available to Sikuli anyway. So if a click fails somehow, only gets obvious, because the subsequent workflow fails at some point (usually a successive FindFailed).\nI suggest, that you currently simply wait, wether my tests reveal something.\nBeta3: nothing speaks against an upgrade. So it is your decision, whether and when to do this.\n. With 1.1.0-Beta3 2014-07-14_01:00nightly (does not contain the waitForIdle patch):\nI made tests of different length (15, 30 60+ minutes) with a click per second at alternating points on a Windows XP running Java 7 latest in a VirtualBox on a Windows 8.1-64. The box window was minimized, but in the small preview one could see the script running (every second click is a rightClick and leads to a menu popup). I did not observe any problems.\nTomorrow I will repeat the tests with the patched version.\nBTW: During your tests does anything or anyone work on the guest machine in parallel?\n. ok, thanks for now.\nI will come back on that tomorrow about this time.\nBTW: what is doesImageExist(image) for?\n. Can I close this issue?\nDid you check with the latest nightly from today (1.1.0 preversion)?\n. no more feedback\n. uuups, forgot to update the Python stuff.\nI will do now and run a new upload later.\nThanks.\n. new version online\n. Warm welcome to the team of contributors.\nOf course I am highly interested.\nHow is your work available? You might contact me privately with my mail at the front.\n. Is this still valid?\n. no hurry, only wanted a \"still alive\".\nThanks for your efforts. RaiMan\n. @rstormsf: ok, fine.\nWith the latest 1.1.0 you should use the load() command to add a .jar to the Jython environment.\nyour example including the needs for SikuliX using an external Jython having sikulixapi.jar on class path:\n```\nimport org.sikuli.basics.SikulixForJython\nfrom sikuli import *\nsys, os and time are already imported now\nload(\"mongo-java-driver-3.0.0-rc1.jar\")\nfrom com.mongodb import *\nm = MongoClient(\"localhost\")\ndb = m.getDB(\"test\")\ncoll = db.getCollection(\"accounts\")\na = coll.findOne()\nprint a\n```\nload() adds the given jar to sys.path as the first entry thus avoiding any conflicts as for example when using the zxJDBC driver to access databases with any compatible JDBC-Driver like ojdbc7.jar from Oracle.\nJars to be used with load() can be in the bundle .sikuli or in the Extensions or Lib folder in the SikulixAppData folder. for other places you must use an absolute path.\nThe zxJDBC.jar now is bundled with SikuliX and can be simply used at runtime:\nload(\"zxJDBC.jar\")\nAfter that you have to also load() a suitable driver like ojdbc7.jar and issue the respective imports before connecting to a database.\nthe same run from the SikuliX IDE or as a script from command line:\nload(\"mongo-java-driver-3.0.0-rc1.jar\")\nfrom com.mongodb import *\nm = MongoClient(\"localhost\")\ndb = m.getDB(\"test\")\ncoll = db.getCollection(\"accounts\")\na = coll.findOne()\nprint a\n. to just make it available for everyone reading this:\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/issues/118#issuecomment-86857236\n. no activity\n. one of the oldest issues with Sikuli and still not solved:\nsee faq https://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli/+faq/933\nif paste() is not suitable for any reason: at least on Windows you might simulate the ALT-NNN to type any character.\nBTW: # -- coding: utf-8 --\nnot needed - auto inserted by Sikuli script run \n. pls. have a look at the docs some time in the future ;-)\nimported .sikuli need at the beginning:\nfrom sikuli import * \n. \u2026 and for such basic usage questions we have launchpad\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli\nwhich might reveal the one or other solution including the faq's section.\nEven the bugs might contain some valuable information, if there is a workaround.\n. Uuups, I have to sincerely apologize for having used some wording and hints, that could be misunderstood or were redundant. Sorry for that.\nAny contribution in any form or at any place is always welcome. So pls, keep on running.\nYou are right:\nIf an imported .sikuli contains any non-ASCII characters, then you have to add the Python coding hint at the beginning. This is not needed only in the main script, where it is inserted automatically by the script runner. \nBTW: you might face other Non-Ascii problems at the interface down to Java (e.g. with popup()).\nOnly with the current 1.1.0 which contains Jython 2.7 it might be possible to finally fix the Non-Ascii-problems down to Java.\nThere are helpers available in Sikuli scripts to deal with UTF-8 content (e.g. coming from files).\n```\nuse instead of print if string variables contain unicode content\nusage: uprint(s1, u1, u2, u3, s3, ...)\ndef uprint(*args):\nto make an utf8-encoded string from a str object\ndef ucode(s):\n```\n. the type problem has nothing to do with UTF-8/unicode, it is simply the fact, that only the US-PC-keyboardlayout is supported and only a subset of the keys. the alternative is to use paste().\n. great ;-)\n. you seem to have some java installation/settings mix-up:\n[debug (14-7-28 5:19:09)] ResourceLoader: check: we are running on arch: x86\n[debug (14-7-28 5:19:09)] ResourceLoader: check: using Java at: C:/Program Files/Java/jre7/\nthe running setup reports a 32-Bit Java in use, but the used java is reported to be in C:/Program Files/Java/jre7/, which in the standard contains the 64-Bit versions.\n. Ok, it does not work.\nI will stop the build for tonight and fix it tomorrow.\nthanks for finding.\n. can I close this issue?\nchecked with the latest nightly 1.1.0 from today?\n. is surely solved\n. Thanks for finding.\nIn my local repo it is ok: the folder name is Libslux. I changed this already.\nBut it was not changed on GitHub, because I had in my global git settings ignore case = true.\nNow I changed it to false and replaced the folders, so it should work now.\n. Thanks for pointing me on that.\nI have just fixed it.\n. Sorry for the inconveniences: I am currently revising the setup procedures.\nNow it is possible, to directly run a setup in the project (I needed that to be able to debug).\nThis is like a complete offline setup (do not allow, to download anything!).\nNo log file is written: everything is shown on stdout.\nI just added the possibility to run it from command line with mvn exec:exec being in folder APIFat (or directly from NetBeans (or Eclipse ???)). Be sure to have run mvn clean install before, if anything has changed.\nThe setup folder used in this case is Setup/target (hardcoded).\nBefore the setup dialog starts internally the needed jars for the offline setup are gathered from the project.\nIf you cancel the setup at the config dialog, you already have a useable sikulixapi\u2026jar in Setup/target that contains the libs for all systems.\n. just checked in my local project (synched using SourceTree) on Mac and Windows:\nworks.\nSure you have the latest git content?\n. I have to admit, that I never tried mvn on some Ubuntu systems.\nBut I think I should have a git/maven environment on Linux too (but I will take Ubuntu 14.04).\nSince the exec plugin simply executes the created command, just check, wether it works on command line directly:\njava -jar target/sikulixapi-complete-1.1.0-Beta4-plain.jar\n. please generally run until stable with the additional java parameter -Dsikuli.Debug=3 to get valuable additional debug information.\nWhen using runsikulix.cmd the parameter is -d 3 to switch on verbose debugging.\nHow did you get your sikulix.jar?\n. ok, sorry, that was too simple:\nversion 1.1.0 contains Jython 2.7 which in turn needs Java 7 or later.\nDo you need an option, to run on Java 6?\nI could add the possibility to setup with Jython 2.5.4, which accepts Java 6.\nBut currently the 1.1.0 sikulix.jar does not work on Java 6.\nI will add it to the docs.\n. ok, thanks for kind feedback, but sometimes I have to apologize for little but annoying carelessness as in this case. I forgot to delete 2 lines, that in all case lead to NPE's, when trying to run scripts from command line.\nSince currently I am revising a major feature, the stuff is unstable and I cannot upload new builds before late tomorrow.\nThe only available workarounds are to run the stuff from inside the IDE or make a Java app, that has a main simply so:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n  org.sikuli.basics.SikuliScript.runscript(args);\n}\nhaving sikulix.jar on class path.\n. The easiest way currently:\nclone this repo to your machine or download the zipped repo.\nHave a working Maven 3+\nat the root of the project run\nmvn clean install (if this is your first time Maven usage: might be lengthy).\ngo to folder APIFat and run \nmvn exec:exec\nthis should build useable stuff in the folder Setup/target.\nthe contained sikulixapi\u2026jar is useable directly, but contains the prebuilt VisionProxy.\nIf you do not want that (means provide your own) run setup and answer the VisionProxy question accordingly. When using sikulixapi.jar, have a libs folder in the same directory. And take care that it contains the marker files 1.1-MadeForSikuliX64L.txt/1.1-MadeForSikuliX32L.txt accordingly.\nTo get the IDE, you have to run the sikulixsetup\u2026jar.\nSetup final testing: If this does not run - simply ignore it.\nRunning Setup: TAKE CARE: do NOT allow to download anything, this is an offline setup (simply say yes to all related questions). Everything needed is already in the Downloads folder.\n. When running \nmvn exec:exec in APIFat\nyou might cancel the setup, to first inspect the produced stuff in Setup/target\n. About the focus and click() problems I cannot help you currently, since I will be on vacation the next 2 weeks and start testing again towards beginning of September.\n. Since I have to admit, that Linux is my weakest area, I am happy for every working solution.\nNever heard about rpath, so I am keen on learning about it: you find my mail on my personal page.\nThanks a lot for your contribution. \n. thanks for wishes and stuff ;-)\n. Hi Dave,\nThanks for feedback. Vacation was ok, thanks.\nI will keep an eye on wmctrl in the future too.\nAs well as on the Linux scene in general (still working a bit focused on Mac and Windows).\nall the best.\nRaimund\nOn 08 Sep 2014, at 20:25, Dave Inman notifications@github.com wrote:\nRaimund,\nIt turns out part of my problem was due to compiling wmctrl for \n64-bits. ( Please recall that\nwmctrl would not change focus to certain windows.) This problem, in my \nopinion a bug in\nwmctrl, causes window ids to be incorrrect. Once I re-built wmctrl for \n32-bits it worked.\nThis is good news. I'm not sure, however, it solves the problems caused \nby the window\nmanager settings commonly used by Linux developers where the window of \nfocus does\nnot have to be the top window on the display.\nWmctrl was not present on my Linux systems so I had to compile it.

Great. Thanks.\n. did you fill in the IP and the port of the proxy into the setup dialog at the bottom?\n. It seems, that the download using a proxy does not work.\nIn fact I never had a chance to test it and will not do it in the near future (little time and no resources)\nSo for now you should run an offline setup after having manually downloaded from the nightly build page:\n- sikulixlibslux\n- 1.1.0-1\n- Jython\ninto the Downloads folder in the setup folder.\nIf you have any idea, how I can simply debug this problem (have and use a proxy) on OS X or Windows, this would help.\n. Thanks for the confirmation of the offline setup working.\nAnd thanks for the proxy hint. I guess I will get it tested with that now.\n. Thanks.\n. Hi Anthony, welcome back again.\nI recommend, to use the version 1.1.0 if possible.\nThis is short before being published on Launchpad, but is currently available already as nightly build.\nThe project homepage now is http://sikulix.com.\n1.1.0 has a silent setup:\nsee #69\nPlease come back with any questions or suggestions.\n. should be solved\n. Thanks for pointing out and the fix.\n... but I will not use it because I want to be as system independent as possible and hence minimize the code in the command scripts.\nversion 1.1.0 (should work in 1.0.1) internally already has a quoted string mechanism, that keeps such a parameter as one. \nIf you use\njava -jar sikulix.jar -r somescript.sikuli -- -t \"Hello World\"\nit works (debug output):\n[debug] --- Sikuli parameters ---\n[debug] 1: -d\n[debug] 2: 3\n[debug] 3: -c\n[debug] --- User parameters ---\n[debug] 1: -t\n[debug] 2: Hello World\nTo get the same result with runsikulix on Mac:\nrunsikulix -r somescript.sikuli -- -t '\"Hello World\"'\nor \nrunsikulix -r somescript.sikuli -- -t \"\\\"Hello World\\\"\"\nwhich preserves the quoting for the internal command line processor.\n. I will add a hint to the docs.\n. I will add a hint to the nightly page:\nBe sure you have read and understood the recommendations at\nhttp://www.sikulix.com/quickstart.html\nin your case especially the section 3. Setup\nhttp://www.sikulix.com/quickstart.html#qs3\n... but I will add checking the path for violations against the recommendations and present an appropriate error message.\n. Thanks for your great work and tips provided.\nI will work through it during the next days.\nI started to work with Ubuntu 14.04 and have a successful build for libVisionProxy.so.\nI want to somehow integrate this into setup (at least create and export fitting build scripts and making suggestions about missing prereqs).\n--- prevent setup from overwriting these libs\nI will fix this (the current approach is nonsense ;-) for tomorrow's build.\n. @Dennis\nYes, but they will terminate with headless exception. Ignore it for now.\nI will check for headless, when running unattended, and run a test, that does not access the screen.\nWill fix it the next days.\n. --- prevent setup from overwriting these libs\nis available since build 2014-12-09\nthe provided libs are packed to the created sikulixapi.jar and sikulix.jar, which might now be safely distributed to other systems having the same characteristics and prerequisites\nobvious ... when using silent setup, the libs folder must be there before starting setup ;-)\n. Thanks Sergey.\n... but we are already a step further:\nwith the latest nightly\n- at the beginning it reports about some prereqs missing (just ignore it and click yes)\n- after downloading you get a question about providing your own libs (latest at this moment before clicking yes, you have to move your own libs to setupfolder/libs)\n- after clicking yes, the provided libs are packed with the created jars, so they simply can be used later without any additional effort\nI will fix some minor problems until tomorrow's build.\nWith silent setup, you have to take care, that your own libs are in place before starting setup.\nI will add an option later for lib provisioning, to add more flexibility.\nlater this week, there will be a version, that\n- detects the linux version\n- evaluate the bundled libs compatibility using ldd and use it if possible\n- otherwise offer 2 options: provide your own libs or let them be built on the fly if possible\nbuild on the fly\n- search for the opencv and tesseract libs\n- check wether a build of libvisionproxy.so is possible (JDK available?)\n- if all prereqs are available (might be made available before with apt-get/yum/...)\n- run a tailored build script\n- check the created libVisionProxy.so with ldd\n- use it for setup if ok\nI already have a pre-version working on Ubuntu 14.04\n@Dennis \nI tested the latest build on Ubuntu with a SikuliX folder in /usr/local/sikulix (as you have):\nif the folder is writeable at runtime (I think, I should check this and have a more precise error message about that), then it works: the bundled libs are exported correctly.\nWith this latest build, there should always be 3 files exported at runtime. Since there are 2 files only in your case, I suppose, you are not using the latest build.\n. @Roman\nthanks for your note.\n... but the JDK is still needed (even with the prepared swig generated java files (which are packed already with the supplemental, so no need to run swig)) for the native compile, since the includes are needed (awt references and JNI usage).\n. @rssdev10 \n- awt dependency: you are right, libVisionProxy does not have any. this is only on Mac and Windows for the App.window() support in the SysUtil libs.\n- thanks for the suggestion. I will implement this in the new approach.\nI hope, that one version of jni.h and jni_md.h is sufficient for all Linux flavours.\nDo you think, that different sets are needed for 32-Bit and 64-Bit? \n. @rssdev10 \nok, thanks\n. @dhoer \nthe latest setup version (2014-12-14+) packs given libs to the created jar (e.g. sikulix.jar), so in any case the jar internal libs folder contains 3 files (the marker file, libVisionProxy.so and libJXGrabKey.so) which are exported at runtime if needed.\nYou might run the created jar after setup and after having deleted the folder libs. It should be recreated with 3 files and should work. \n. sorry for the late answer, but I wanted to try to fix this first.\nwith the setup jar from nightly today (2015-01-06) it should work now.\nsee my comment at\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1407822\none caveat: I removed the remote server from setup. So just use a jar you already have.\nI will provide a download option again later.\nDo you need it as setup option?\n. --- Debug output\nsetup generally runs with debug level 3 (interactive and silent) and the most details are always in the setup log file.\n--- new setup with inline build (2015-01-06+)\nif you have provided a libs folder in the setup folder before running setup, the contained libs will be recognised and tested and finally bundled with the target artefact (sikulix.jar and/or sikulixapi.jar).\nDetails about what happened and was done is in the log file.\nthat you get this log\n[debug (1/6/15 6:01:03 PM)] ResourceLoader: extractLibs: from: /usr/local/sikulix/sikulixapi.jar\n[debug (1/6/15 6:01:03 PM)] ResourceLoader: extractLibs: Found 1 Files in META-INF/libs/linux/libs64/\nmeans, that the setup did not work as it should.\nTo clarify: send me the setup log file to the mail found on https://github.com/RaiMan\n. --- the remote stuff\nremoterobot \n(the former remoteserver) is simply a Java Robot implementation, that accepts capture requests, mouse and keyboard actions via a socket  based communication.\nThe client side is started with a RemoteScreen().\nIt only works in non-headless environments and is useable.\nI will keep this as the \"poor man's remote solution\", since it works right out of the box.\nI will somehow bring back the possibility to download it separately. \nremoteserver \nis a http server, that accepts REST requests currently with a small feature subset.\nThe client is in RESTClient.\nIt is a contribution and in a very early stage. I have moved it to version 2.\nFor SikuliX it is vital, to have such a server, that processes SikuliX requests, since with this SikuliX features can be used from \"everywhere\".\nOnly runs non-headless.\nVNC-Client\nThis is integrated into version 1.1.0, principally available and should work.\nIt is also a contribution, poorly documented and has nearly no exception handling (simply crashes, if something is as it should not be).\nSince it only needs access to a suitable VNC-server, headless or not does not matter.\nThis will be a major topic with version 2.\nheadless / non-headless\nSince the current implementation of SikuliX is based on the Java Robot feature, it only works, if Java in the GraphicsEnvironment has a real monitor or thinks it has one.\nSo if you run on a system, that does not have a real monitor, you have to setup your system in a way, that Java thinks it has a monitor (e.g. using the respective X11 features or whatever).\n. the name given with the onAppear must be the name of the handler def\nonAppear(\"1417656637670.png\", self.onCreateProjectError)\nobserve(FOREVER, background = True)\ndef onCreateProjectError(event):\nraise Exception(\"An error occured creating the project\"\n... and since it seems you have it in a Class definition:\ndef onCreateProjectError(self, event):\n. ok, reproducible.\nreason: App.window() returns a \"Java level\" Region object, that does not fit for the script level.\nI will fix this in version 1.2.\nFor now the workaround (in any such situations):\ncast the complaining Region object to a script level Region object.\nIn your case:\nrd = Region(App(\"Internet Explorer\").window())\n. for version 1.1.0:\nif D:\\sikulix is your setup folder containing sikulixapi.jar and the libs folder and you have run setup with option 3, then you don't need to do anything., since libs/tessdata is the standard location assumed.\nNevertheless: I will evaluate your situation the next days.\n. fixed in 1.1.0 final\n. ...

Sorry, no.\nPostponed to version 2.\n. Hi Roman,\nall the best for you and Ivan for 2015.\nDid you test the VNC Controller successfully against some VNC server? I did not have a chance until now. If yes, what was your setup?\n. This is by intention (at least currently for version 1.1.0):\nthe folder containing the SikuliX stuff () MUST be exclusive for SikuliX.\nFor unattended setup only the folder \\Downloads (may contain pre-downloaded artefacts) and on Linux the folder libs is protected against this clean-up.\nIt is up to you to move the created stuff (mainly skulixapi.jar and/or sikulix.jar) to wherever you want afterwards.\nBTW: the next nightly build will no longer export the native libs (folder libs) to the folder containing the sikulix artefact, but to the temp folder area. And the folder recreation is no longer bound to the setup time, but to the build version.\nOne more thing: there is another options option notest, that skips the final tests, which might be useful on headless systems.\n. sorry for the inconvenience:\nI am currently doing some major changes, so not everything might work.\nIf you need valid jars, you have to use the latest nightly build.\nThe project will be ready again when the next nightly build is available (a few days).\n. no activity\n. the information is on the home page of SikuliX:\nhttp://www.sikulix.com/quickstart.html\nYou have to install Tesseract 3, sin\bce the dependent stuff (OpenCV, Tesseract, ...) has to be provided by you on Linux in a any case.\nWhat Linux?\n. You have to go to\n/opt/Sikuli/1.1.0.2/Build\nand repair the /opt/Sikuli/1.1.0.2/Build/runBuild script .\nIf it works you will get a libsVisionProxy.sh, that you put into the setup-folder/libs and start the setup again, now taking the provided lib.\nMore I cannot do for you in the moment, since I will publish the next nightly only next week.\n. no activity\n. known restriction: the image to be searched for must be the same in width and height (pixels) in the image to search in (usually the screen).\nIf this is not the case you need different image sets.\n. ok, thanks. fixed in next nightly.\neven though it is only some fall back, looking for java.exe is better.\nThe suggested solution in such unclear situations is to set JAVA_HOME before running SikuliX.\n. Though id might be anything (I could name it blabla ;-) I changed to com.sikuli to avoid any confusion.\nrelevant for finding sikulixapi.jar are only groupId and artifactId in the dependency settings.\n. since you are posting here:\nwhere did you get the setup.jar?\n. 1.0.1 does not work on OSX 10.10.\ntry with the nightly build 1.1.0 from http://sikulix.com\n. \u2026 started and got this:\nwhat did you get?\n. please send me the setup log to my mail at https://github.com/RaiMan\n. In a terminal session issue the command:\n/usr/libexec/java_home -V\nand post the output here.\n. no problem. have fun.\n\u2026 and come back with whatever question.\n. what is the issue?\n. ok, understood.\nI will fix that.\n. The above pointer to the nixes issue gave me the way to the github location.\nBut I could not find the Sikuli package at the place the pull request patches point to.\ngenerally:\nwhen you use the nightly stuff for an offline setup (what you seem to do in your packaging), then always all downloaded artefacts must belong to the same nightly build.\nthis affects\nsikulixsetup\n1.1.0-1\n1.1.0-2\nand in your case\nlibslinux\nBTW: the final 1.1.0 (partly already in the next nightly) will not export anymore to the folder holding the active artefact (libs, Lib, tessdata), but to standard places in the user home directory (or other places by option).\nAnd the lib exports will be tagged with the build timestamp.\nSo it is now possible to freely move/copy the artefacts (sikulix.jar, sikulixapi.jar) wherever you want.\n. Hope, that this is not a general misunderstanding:\n-- 1: to get a running IDE, from the latest nightly build, you have to take the respective setup jar and download the respective jars needed (see above). the downloaded jars on it's own are not useable, but have to be run through setup (in your case the silent setup inside the package installation).\n-- 2: to get a useable sikulixapi.jar, you might go the same path or get the snapshots from sikulixapi.jar and sikulixlibslinux from OSSRH (pre MavenCentral) (repo pointer see homepage)\n... and on linux you currently still have the problem, that depending on the prerequisites the provided libVisionProxy.so might not work and has to be built from the sources on this system.\nCurrently (nightly mid January) the \"build on the fly\" is only supported in setup, but not in the Maven artefact (this is what I am currently working on for one of the next nightlies/snapshots and the final 1.1.0).\nThis is why I want to know, how you currently tackle this challenge: libVisionProxy.so does not work.\n. Mid of January I decided, to revise some vital areas (startup, script run support, linux \"libVisionProxy-build-onthefly\", ...). The nightlies are paused since then. The next nightly will be available during coming weekend. The final 1.1.0 will be available mid of March.\nWhat parts of Sikuli are you packaging with nixos?\nHow did you solve the OpeneCV/Tesseract dependency challenge?\nHow did you solve the libVisionProxy.so build?\nI would be interested in this dependency control and the libVisionProxy.so build you are using, to check it against my \"build-on-the-fly\" workflow.\n. I fully agree with all your points and suggestions, but I have to admit, that supporting any repackaging is not my main focus.\nOn Mac and Windows, this challenge does not exist anyways and on Linux I think I am short before supporting the main distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, CentOs and Fedora) from setup.\nFor the others I want to make life as easy for them as possible: spit out a build script, that has to be adapted to their situation and works.\nI will not invest in any of these native support stuff like auto tools and make and whatever. If anyone comes up with a good solution for that: welcome.\nAnother reason to not invest here: I will cut off any native coding with version 2 anyways. Everything will be on the Java level, accessing the OpenCV, Tesseract and system specific things via available bridging/binding libraries. I have already started with this (switched off in the distribution) for OpenCV features.\nwhat I will do:\n- concentrate all the linux library stuff into sikulixlibslinux and make it runnable about the checking and building (additionally to the usage with setup)\n- document the options to use, that hinder setup from doing anything with the native stuff (neither export nor build)\n- make the nightly files versioned\napart from that I will not do any major changes in version 1.1.x\n. BTW: Of course I highly appreciate your input and will accept any contributions that are intended to make YOUR life easier.\n. ok, fine.\nthen how would a versioning of the nightly artefacts be suitable for you?\nsomething like the maven snapshot numbering with a timestamp?\nor some number (e.g. year + number of day?)\nI do not need it anyways, since I internally have my build timestamp.\n. I already expected this kind of request, but I will definitely not retain more than one nightly set, which is the latest one.\nThe number I will add can thus only be used, to decide, wether it makes sense to download a newer version than that already built.\n. hydra.nixos.org: No problem, tell me what you need from my side.\n. static build: \nI already thought about that, but since I am not that expert in building native stuff, I left it aside.\nCan you do that with your nixos packager?\n. see https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/commit/6d4b50d47f6898457bc35d3ed35720070984e808\n. Not really sure what you mean with \"exported as\"\nWith SikuliX you have to options with scripting:\n-- 1: use the SikuliX IDE. Then you can use either Python or Ruby language for scripting, since these 2 interpreters (Jython and/or JRuby) can be bundled with the IDE (sikulix.jar with 1.1.0)\n-- 2: use any IDE environment with any scripting language that either directly or indirectly (via some bridging/binding libraries) allow to use compiled Java classes usually packaged in jars (with version 1.1.0 you would use sikulixapi.jar). The runtime support for scripting in this case has to be setup by yourself.\nAs far as I understand the Selenium IDE, then it uses some DSL, that can be exported to different scripting languages or even Java code.\nSo final question: what do you mean with: machine parsable format?\n. Feel free to do what you want in your fork. Even if together with a pull request it will be switched on again, I can live with this inconvenience ;-)\nIt is not blowing my infrastructure, but it is my time during testing, that is wasted.\nThe Maven/OSSRH upload sikulixapi.jar is with docs and sources anyway and I think, this is what finally counts.\n. Would be possible on Windows only currently anyways, so meanwhile issue a start command to get what you want.\nThe App class will only be revised in version 2.\n. sorry, I have overseen this post.\nI will check it. thanks.\n. only ImagePath.addHTTP() can be used to add a pointer to the net.\nsetBundlePath() can only be used with Filesystem path's, which is due to the fact, that the bundle path is also the pointer for the IDE to store captured images.\nAll this will only be revised in version 2, where the 1.1.x-bundle will be a subset of a project, that contains everything needed (code, images and options) - something like a Maven project with a pom-file.\nI have fixed the problem with the above toURI()-usage, in a way, so it is consistent with the other implementations around path handling (so not simply going back to the artier version as you did ;-)\nanyway: thanks for finding.\n. with the current 1.1.0 pre-final you at least can add a location in the net to the image path.\nThis lets you access images at runtime.\nYou are responsible yourself to get the images uploaded somehow.\nsee the javadocs http://nightly.sikuli.de/docs/\nespecially: http://nightly.sikuli.de/docs/org/sikuli/script/ImagePath.html#addHTTP-java.lang.String-\n. The right nightly is always the one available (there are no historic versions - only one at time)\nIf yo can wait a few days: after 5 weeks there will be a recent nightly.\nBut nothing speaks against just starting with the Jan-16 (the currently latest) version to get familiar with everything.\nWith usage patterns and API it is stable.\n. definitely 3 others (testing specific things) and myself on Mac, Windows and Linux.\nthere are about 100 forks on GiHub, where I do not know, what they are doing.\nBut again: start with the available nightly TODAY or do not do it at all.\nThe next nightly will not be more stable than the current one.\nRunning on Mac and Window is rather safe, other Linux than current Ubuntu (and other Debian derivates) are risky anyways.\nBTW: looking from the standpoint of a professional developer or tester SikuliX is risky anyways, since it is still not tested seriously and completely.\nSo if you use it for very important projects and/or projects with a strict timeline, you should be very careful, though the core features have a short learning curve. \nIf you tell me a bit more about your project, may be I can give you a better suggestion (system(s), web app or not, strict GUI, ....)\nRaimund\n\nOn 25 Feb 2015, at 23:22, tmairegasnighto notifications@github.com wrote:\nWhat's going to be in this next nightly?

Yes, confirmed.\nwill not be fixed in 1.1.0.\nIn version 2 I will find a better solution for doing runtime annotations.\n. --1. sorry for not being consistent in the java docs: all classes Image\u2026. except ImagePath are not for public use currently and even not later with any 1.1.x. for that you have to wait for version 2.\nI will add respective warnings to the classes, that should not be used currently in user programs.\n--2. the correct usage of the Finder class (see docs) is:\nFinder f = new Finder(baseImage);\nf.find(targetImage); // a return value of null signals, that the image file could not be loaded\nMatch m = null;\nif (f.hasNext()) {\n   m = f.next();\n}\nif (m != null): // now we can continue with the match\n--3. your sikulixapi version\nin standard Maven manner the intended use is:\n```\n\n\n OSSRH: com.sikulix \ncom.sikulix\ncom.sikulix\nhttps://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public\ndefault\n\ntrue\nalways\n\n\ntrue\nalways\n\n\n\n\n\ncom.sikulix\nsikulixapi\n1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n\n```\nIf you use it this way, the sikulixlibslux.jar should be automatically downloaded and be on class path at runtime, when running with Maven.\nNevertheless I have to check, why not the latest sikulixapi from this morning is on OSSRH, but still the version from mid january.\nYou should try again tomorrow.\n. You might try already now. new version is online (snapshot version: 20150325.143910-76)\n. Guess you did not read the http://sikulix.com/quickstart\n. Thanks for feedback.\n. As mentioned on the nightly page:\nThe manually downloaded stuff (sikulixapi-1.1.0-20150325.143910-76.jar and sikulixlibsmac-1.1.0-20150325.143602-89.jar in your case) is not useable as such.\nIt MUST be processed by sikulixsetup to get a useable sikulixapi.jar, which on top has the advantage to be a stable name to reference.\n\u2026 and it is also stated:\n-- run in a way, that your current installation and your work is safe or can be restored\nSo if you backup the last running version of sikulixapi.jar, you can always restore it, if needed.\nSo do me a favor and run setup in the intended way and use sikulixapi.jar instead of you 2-classpath-entry-hack.\nOn Mac, the session persistence store is in\n~/Library/Preferences/org.sikuli\u2026\u2026plist\nPurging this file and the respective .lockfile will reset the session store. \n. load('sikulixapi.jar')\nimport org.sikuli.basics.SikulixForJython\nfrom sikuli import *\n... does not make sense, since load() is only available after from sikuli import *, since it is a SikuliX feature.\nsikulixapi.jar ALWAYS must be on Java class path. How to add it there depends on the way you start Jython. usually one adds CLASSPATH=.... to the system environment some how (static or dynamic).\nso according to\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/wiki/Usage-in-Java-programming\nthis is valid:\n- take care, that sikulixapi.jar is on the Java class path before starting Jython\n- in your script at the beginning before using any SikuliX features add\nimport org.sikuli.basics.SikulixForJython\nfrom sikuli import *\nThe first import checks the environment for some aspects important for SikuliX and adds sikulixapi.jar/Lib to the python path (sys.path).\nThe second import adds many SikuliX methods and classes (Java and Python) to the global namespace and does some initialization for the Jython environment.\n. Thanks for confirmation. all the best.\n--- I thought I could just add jar dynamically\nYep, that is the story of the still open question:\nWhat was first: the chicken or the egg???\n. --- must i use jdk:1.7\nno, I want to stay Java 6 compatible with 1.1.x\nJust fixed the above problem.\nI will run a nightly build now. \nShould be available latest in one hour.\n. Yep, confirmed. Will fix it until tomorrow's nightly.\nworkaround:\nadd a valid \nJAVA_HOME=....\nto environement.\n. no activity\n. what exactly means\n--- this script will hang on at #3. ???\nsymptoms, error messages?\n. ok, found out my self: loops endlessly.\nwill fix it as soon as possible.\n. fixed with tomorrow's nightly.\nthanks for finding.\n. available now\n. What version of SikuliX are you talking about?\nCould you be a bit more specific with the problems you have?\nany examples?\n. Did you show it on your own machine or any other machine?\npossible to get a screenshot of the failing case and the Image you use.\nat least paste the relevant code here, to see how you are using the feature.\n. r.click(iterator.next()); // click on drop-down\nI guess after this the dropdown opens. this usually take some time or is somehow animated, which in turn takes time.\nSince you are using the same region r for the button search, the following might happen:\n- the first search starts some milliseconds after the click\n- the dropdown is not yet (fully) open\n- the search finds something similar to \"button image path\" in the region r and finishes (still the dropdown might not be fully open)\nwhat can you do?\n- use Pattern and raise minimum similarity to avoid false positives\n- restrict the region to the smaller area, where you expect the dropdown to appear (not shown here)\n- add r.wait(0.5) after the click to open dropdown\nTo have more options for debugging and optimisations:\n//Debug.on(3) // uncomment to switch on verbose debug output\nmatches Iterator <Match> = r.findAll(\"drop-down image path\"); // r is region \nPattern pButton = new Pattern(\"button image path\").similar(0.9);\nMatch mButton;\nwhile (matches.hasNext()) {\n    Match m = matches.next(); // m now could be inspected with debugging\n    r.click(m); // click on drop-down\n    if ((mButton = r.exists(pButton))!=null) { // checks for button image and saves the match\n        r.click(mButton); // just click the match, do not search again\n        break;\n    }\n}\n//Debug.off() // uncomment to switch off debug\n. ok, the 0.98 might be a similarity, that is too high, so depending on the quality of your image (amount of background towards the edges), it just splits between found and failed around 0.98.\nSo test e.g. with 0.9.\nsince everything with Sikuli is about RGB-pixels contained in a rectangular screen area and on the other hand it is based on the matchTemplate feature of OpenCV, there are many possible reasons for the fact, that Sikuli finds something else, than expected.\nSo if Sikuli finds something, but that is not what you expect, then it does not fail and you have to sort out the reason for this not expected behaviour.\nSo you either send me some images privately, that I can check or you use the above mentioned debugging option. \nThat is all I can do for you.\n. will only be addressed in version 2\n. possible? of course ;-) \n.... but ;-)\nThe setup with the final 1.1.x will be a bit easier to handle than the current nightly builds, but there will always be a setup with this version:\n- there are 3 system variants (Windows, Mac and Linux)\n- there are 2 usage variants (IDE and API)\n- for the mostly used Jython scripting, there are 2 variants (Java 6 and Java 7+)\n- then we have the Ruby option\n- then we have the bundled Tesseract option\nI have already stripped down the variants and needed packages and the setup now runs rather reliably (online or offline). for offline setup it is clearly stated, what you have to download for what.\nSince the setup is needed anyway to build these \"unpack and run\" packages, the difference currently is, that only the build and upload of the base packs runs on my private Jenkins server and the user has to do the rest. But I do not really see the problem.\nLater this year with a 1.1.x we will probably have an \"unpack and run\" for the IDE for Windows (.exe) and Mac (.app) and probably an option to let these packages spit out a ready-to-use sikulixapi.jar.\nFor Linux the situation will always be different, since there we need some prerequisites, that cannot be bundled, since they are linux flavour specific.\nBut feel free, to make any suggestions, that would make it possible, to get what you want in a way, that works fully automatic and can be run on my Jenkins server or on any \"build-and-deploy\" service available in the net.\n. Thanks. Good point.\nadded to runsikulix.cmd - available 2015-04-20+\n. maybe next week the final 1.1.0.\nLaunchpad: yes.\n. see docs:\nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/keys.html#key-constants\n. A key is called a modifier key, when it is used in conjunction with other keys by pressing and holding it while typing the other keys.\nThe keys used most commonly as modifier keys are SHIFT, ALT (left alt key, CTRL (might be strg on Windows) and the CMD key (Apple key on OS X).\nOn Windows you additionally have the Windows key and the alt key on the right.\nthe plain type command has 2 parameters:\nparameter 1: the keys, that should be pressed/released one after the other\nparameter 2: the modifier keys, that alltogether should be pressed and held during the typing and released at the end.\nFor parameter 2 there are 2 options:\nold version (kept for upwards compatibility): KeyModifier.XXX\nnew version: (a key is a key ;-): Key.XXX\nSo in your case, it does not matter, what the key presses are used for (SikuliX does not know anything about the GUI anyway).\nAlt-<Key> simply is\ntype(<Key>, Key.ALT)\nin any case.\n. ok, you are right ;-)\nI will adjust the docs. thanks.\n. please check the changes i made. thanks.\n. thanks for feedback.\ngood points.\n. I think, now it should be sufficient.\n. Might be, but this is far beyond, what the SikuliX IDE will ever support.\nIf you need to have such things, then you have to structure your scripts into modules, classes and/or functions. This is the \"cell\" concept of Python and other comparable scripting languages.\nIf you need some kind of debugging and this is not sufficient, then you have to use an IDE, that supports debugging like Eclipse/PyDev or others.\n. I could add such an option, but this only works in situations, where the script does not have any \"history\" up to this point (like assigning  values to variables or other things done before that line, that are needed after that line).\nI still think, that dividing a script into portions packed in  def()s, that are then called as needed, is sufficient and helps to have your workflow clearly structured.\n. the usual Python way, to solve that:\n```\ndef setup():\n     # some code\ndef step1():\n     # some code\ndef step2():\n    # some code\ndef step3():\n     # some code\ndef step4():\n     # some code\ndef teardown():\n     # some code\nsetup()\nstep1()\nstep2()\nstep3()\nstep4()\nteardown()\n```\nif you would use functions with parameters, you could even fine tune, what is done in each step.\nNow you can simply comment/uncomment the single lines as needed.\nwith the latest 1.1.0 you could even do this with your files from one script:\nrunScript(\"firstOne\")\nrunScript(\"secondOne\")\nrunScript(\"thirdOne\")\nrunScript(\"lastOne\")\n. Thanks for the info, but what happened? Error messages?\nFor use with Sikuli it is sufficient to use the standalone jar (no installation needed):\njython-standalone-2.7-b4.jar\nThis is also the one, that currently is bundled with Sikulix (sikulix.jar).\n. That is interesting, because the error should have nothing to do with the used Jython version (an early startup problem using Sikuli features).\nSo it would be helpful, to get information of your setup (class path, shell script, ...)\n. I made some tests.\nyour code can be stripped down so:\n```\nsys and os are already imported by sikuli import *\nimport subprocess\nimport org.sikuli.script.SikulixForJython # with 1.1.0+\nfrom sikuli import *\nload('sikulixapi.jar') # this is already loaded and on class and python path\nload(\"mongo-java-driver-3.0.0-rc1.jar\")\nImagePath.add(\"C:\\sikulix\\test.sikuli\\.\")\nfrom com.mongodb import \nfrom com.mongodb.client.model import \nfrom org.bson import *\n```\nI was not able to import anything from the mongodb.jar, since with every variant some Java classes where missing.\ne.g. with from com.mongodb import *\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/mongodb/ReadPreference\n(I looked into the jar: a class ReadPreference in fact does not exists)\nI another test variant it got obvious, that the complete connection.* branch is missing.\nwhen running this in the IDE, this internal import error is wrapped and finally reported as ImportError-module-not-found (which indeed is irritating - I put it on the list, to change the behaviour)\nI tested the import with my own jar and this worked in all situations.\nAnyway: be sure to use the same latest version in all these different scenarios.\n. no more activities\n. Why do you want to run a setup from inside the sources?\nThere is a setup jar downloadable from the nightly page.\n... or did you make any changes, that you want to test?\nNevertheless: just revised the runsetup script. it now works when run in the root of the project.\nIn all cases you have to run a clean install at the root level before.\nIf not: just double click on the Setup/target/setup-1.1.0-forsetup.jar\n or run the setup module from inside Netbeans/Eclipse.\nOn Mac, the setup results when running this way are stored in \n~/Library/Application Support/Sikulix/SikulixSetup\n. no more activity\n. I currently bundle Jython 2.7-rc3 with IDE 1.1.0, which apparently has some problems with unicode characters in different situations (especially with items in the system environment, which leads to that the interpreter cannot be started internally).\nI will go back to version 2.5.4-rc1 (tomorrow's nightly build), since it does not look like these problems will be fixed in Jython the next days.\n. @techtonik \nthis is already on the list there:\nhttp://bugs.jython.org/issue2340\n. Sorry, overseen.\n... but should be fixed now.\n. confirmed.\nmade it a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1451326\n. Sorry, not a feature available in SikuliX.\nThe only method, that could yield some results:\nIn an image viewer take care that the images are shown one after the other in the same size and in the same region and then use the observe/onChange with a suitable scan rate.\nOnly an idea, not tested in any aspect, but onChange delivers the parts of an image that changes form one observe step to the next.\nInstead of an image viewer you might as well script/program the image display accordingly.\n. Will be a feature in version 2\n. Since I can only test that on Monday:\nDoes this happen with the latest build from today or even with a fork of the current repo?\n. ok, thanks.\nI am already on track to fix the problem.\n. should be fixed now (2015-05-15+)\n. Thanks for the pointer.\nArrrg, stupid, careless mistake.\nIs fixed now. I will trigger a build, so it will be available in about one hour.\n. Yep, this might happen in the IDE when repeating scripts, where the image (like your img1) was already found before (wrong, but with a score of say 0,77).\nNow you start to raise the min similarity, to get correct matches, but it still finds the image in a wrong place.\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1461533 and the related question for more information and workarounds until fixed.\nAnother workaround is to put \nImage.reset()\nat the beginning of the script until this is fixed and you are repeating the same script with modified Pattern settings.\n. - restarting the SikuliX IDE is enough (no need to restart OS X)\n--- 2. Open the img2_WrongTarget.png.\nI do not understand what you mean by \"open\" and what image is it?\n--- 4. Run click(img2Path) [just this one line in IDE]\nwhat image is img2Path?\n. You cannot use the img2.png as such, you have to use a Pattern with a high similarity.\ntry: click(Pattern(\"img2.png\").similar(0.95))\n. --- Why I have to use a Pattern for img2.png?\n... because the pixel pattern apparently matches other places on the screen as well with a similarity >0.7, which is the default, when not using Pattern().similar().\nusing Pattern().similar() besides restricting the search region is the only way, to match what you expect.\nmight be helpful to understand: \nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basicinfo.html#sikulix-how-does-it-find-images-on-the-screen\n. In SikuliX the Java Robot class is used to take screenshots and the result is an in-memory representation of the image pixels (Java BufferedImage class).\nThis action (screen taking) takes some milliseconds depending on the image size. \nWhat you mean by \"screen processing\" can only be the find op done on this screenshot.\nIf you have a screenshot of WS x HS pixels and an image of WI x HI pixels then the cost of processing roughly is:\n(WS*HS - WI*HI) * WI*HI * BASEOP\nwhere BASEOP is the evaluation of the differences of 2 images of size WI*HI (which results in the score value at that pixel in the screenshot)\nThe timing can be described roughly as:\na find op is faster\n- the smaller the screenshot is\n- the more equal the sizes of shot and image are\nWhich leads to the general recommendation, to restrict the search region as often as possible to the smallest possible area.\nAbout VNC and Sikuli, you have to scan the Internet (even StackOverflow has some questions/answers about that).\n. Generally this Java Robot feature createScreenCapture will only capture what currently is visible on the screen (hence only the pixels in the screen buffer). It knows nothing about windows and other GUI elements. So hidden or minimized does not mean anything in this context.\n. @techtonik asked: embed some benchmarks into Sikuli to measure all this stuff\nthis is already available now.\nm = find(someImage)\nprint m\nprints something like:\nM[14,44 106x35]@S(S(0)[0,0 1440x900]) S:1.00 C:67,61 [303/302 msec]\nwhere \nM is the match region\nS( the screen where it is on\nS: the similarity score\nC: the center of the match\n[n/m msec] search time: n over all, m of the last search repetition\nIf the image is still in the same place when run again you get much shorter times due to the CheckLastSeen feature:\nM[14,44 106x35]@S(S(0)[0,0 1440x900]) S:1.00 C:67,61 [31/31 msec]\n. I do not understand what you need????\nJust setup a script and run it from command line.\n. loops = 100\nstart = time.time()\nfor n in range(loops):\n    find(someImage) # see **comment\nelapsed = time.time() - start\noneFind = int(elapsed/loops)\nprint \"one find: %d msec\" % (oneFind)\n**comment\nin this line you might call some function, that does special things\n--- It is also interesting to know what takes more time - taking screenshot, converting it to OpenCV format or pattern matching?\nNot clear what you mean:\npattern matching is exactly, what SikuliX does: searching one image in another image. \nIf you search on the screen, another image must be a screenshot.\n. I added some more detailed timing information, that produces output like this for one find op:\n[FindProfiling] Screen.capture [1440 x 900]: 27 msec\n[FindProfiling] createCVMat [1440 x 900]: 156 msec\n[FindProfiling] createCVMat [105 x 32]: 1 msec\n[FindProfiling] Region.doFind final: 208 msec\nin this case the image is found on first try.\nif it is not found on first try (waiting for), you get something like this:\n[FindProfiling] Screen.capture [1440 x 900]: 20 msec\n[FindProfiling] createCVMat [1440 x 900]: 119 msec\n[FindProfiling] createCVMat [105 x 32]: 1 msec\n[FindProfiling] Region.doFind repeat: 396 msec\n[FindProfiling] Screen.capture [1440 x 900]: 24 msec\n[FindProfiling] createCVMat [1440 x 900]: 118 msec\n[FindProfiling] Region.doFind repeat: 397 msec\n[FindProfiling] Screen.capture [1440 x 900]: 21 msec\n[FindProfiling] createCVMat [1440 x 900]: 107 msec\n[FindProfiling] Region.doFind repeat: 433 msec\n[FindProfiling] Region.doFind final: 17 msec\nThe information is not really separated according to your mentioned steps and has to be read like this:\n- when found on first try \n  - [FindProfiling] Screen.capture: capture the given screen region to a BufferedImage (inMemory)\n  - [FindProfiling] createCVMat: convert this BufferedImage into the internal OpenCV format (CVMat)\n  - [FindProfiling] Region.doFind final: the complete find op including the above steps, which means that the time for OpenCV matchTemplate() search op is the rest after subtracting the steps before (in the example: 208 - 27 - 156 - 1 = 124 msecs)\n- when found after repetitions (waiting)\n  - the final time does not seem to be comparable to the first try situation (still under evaluation)\nThe challenge:\ncurrently the timing cannot be taken consistently (different places and classes in the code, not thread safe). It only gives some hint about the different steps and might allow to compare the same situation on different systems or different setups.\nIt is not possible anyway to do anything about that timing currently, without changing the SikuliX code.\n... and this will be done with version 2 anyway.\nBTW: to switch the above output on and off:\nSettings.FindProfiling = True/False\n. sorry, from tomorrows build only ;-)\n. You might play around with it a little. I will not do anything else with it in the moment.\nOnly with version 2 I will go into that again (including CVMat caching instead of BufferedImages and a faster way to get from screenshot to CVMat)\n. What system environment on the test clients?\nWhat Java?\nAny parallel SikuliX processing on the freezing machine (e.g. with sub processing or observe in background)?\nDoes it really freeze (stop doing anything, just waiting) or are there excessive pauses during clicks?\nDoes it happen after a longer time (some 10 minutes or even hours) or randomly also after a short time?\nDoes it happen on all clients or only some? if only some: what are the common characteristics?\n. @soto1231 \nThanks for the evaluation and input.\nOnce again I have to realize, that it seems to hang with the Robot.waitForIdle() (which, looking at the docs, waits until all queued Robot actions are processed)\nSo the interesting question on top is: is this last double click in your example done or not? Any chance, to check that? \n. --- Regarding the double click, it does happen ...\n... thanks for confirming that\n--- There is a link here regarding what I think might be happening ...\n... not relevant for this problem, since when a script runs (even from the IDE) there is no EDT, that might be blocked and not any mouse listener is used. Thanks anyway.\n--- Settings.MoveMouseDelay = 2\n... if this actually works, then also your observation \"problems on faster machines\" makes sense. This simply means, that at least between clicks on different points in a row there is at least a delay of 2 seconds. On the other hand: using Settings.MoveMouseDelay = 0 should run into problems even after a short time.\nThanks for your cooperation.\n. --- but the other implementation of IRobot.class, which is RobotRemote.class, uses an empty waitForIdle() method\nVNCRobot and RemoteRobot are implementations, that use some Robot feature on the remote machine and hence have to implement an empty waitForIdle(). \n... but as far as I understood: we are talking about a situation on a desktop and not about any remote situation??\n--- What would happen if there is effectively no waitForIdle()\n... I have no idea. In the next nightly build of 1.1.1 I will add a switch, to run without waitForIdle(), so you might test again then. I will give you a note.\n... and I will setup a long running click test on a Windows machine. \nBTW: what kind of application is automated by your SikuliX scripts? (Java/JVM based or not?)\n. could you please try with the latest build\n. runsikulix: a command script (usually to be used with parameters to run scripts from command line)\nsikulix.jar: the java jar file to be run with Java (can usually be double clicked to start the IDE)\n.

Thanks for the pointer.\nI did not use your approach (is more a workaround), but added a getApp() stub implementation.\nAvailable with tomorrow's build\n. --- note they are the same images!\n... this means, you have copied the images file.png and save.png form the .sikuli testcase to C:\\Users\\Anto\\IdeaProjects\\sikuli\\imgs\\ ?\n--- its bit confusing though.\nyes;-)\nthe only possible reasons (since the file.png was found)\n- the save button took more than 3 seconds to appear\n- the save button seen on the screen does not match with a score of at least 0.7\n--- could you run your script example in the IDE and add \nDebug.setDebugLevel(3)\nas the first line and compare the output.\nA hint:\nIf you already have a .sikuli, that contains the images, then you can use in your Java code:\nImagePath.add(\"<absolule path to your .sikuli\")\nand then simply\nregion.click(\"file.png\");\nWhen not running in the IDE, it is good practice, to have a images.sikuli somewhere, that you use to manage your images and then add it to the image path.\nOne more thing:\nIf you are still in the phase of \"beginning with Sikuli\" you should check out version 1.1.0 pre final (http://sikulix.com)\n. ---  what resolution does IDE takes the screenshots\njust the RGB pixels as they are sent to the screen.\nlook for some explanations here:\nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basicinfo.html#sikulix-how-does-it-find-images-on-the-screen\ncome back with questions then. \n--- 1.0.1 is deprecated?\nyes, in the sense, that there will not be any fixes or new features. It is simply frozen.\n1.1.0 has many enhancements (not everything documented yet) and is much more robust in setup and usage.\nJust have a look and decide.\n. Thanks for the evaluation.\n... but this is no longer relevant with 1.1.0:\n- at runtime, the dll set, fitting the used Java version's bitness, is exported to a central SikuliX repository on that system\n- the path to the libs folder is added on the fly to system path only for this run (Win32 API via bridj)\n- the actual awt.dll is copied to the libs folder\nWith 1.1.0 you do not need anything anymore in system environment for Sikulix to work (either as GUI, from command line or with API usage) \nAll necessary prerequisites are checked and/or setup on startup before any SikuliX feature is used.\n. Sorry, did not want to correct you: with respect to 1.0.1 you are absolutely right.\nI only wanted to point out, that things have changed a bit in 1.1.0\n. Confirmed. Messed something up.

Yes, I have seen it.\nmissunderstanding, sorry: I meant, that the use of ../TestQR.sikuli/ on the commandline might lead internally to a wrong entry in sys.path, that is added by SikuliX automatically.\nI will check that.. @JoelJoy58 \nit seems that openpyxl is not coded only in Python language, but contains or depends on C-based stuff. If this is true, it cannot be used with Jython (Java based).. ok, I will check that next week, when I am back from vacation.\n. works in 1.1.0 final\n```\nbrings Safari to front\nApp.focus(\"Safari\")\nhighlights Safari's window\nApp.focusedWindow().highlight(2)\n```\n. do you have more than one monitor attached?\n. ok, thanks. I have to check that.\n. I am sorry, but apparently using Maven from command line does not work currently (I do not use it, since I do my development and the runs from inside Netbeans, where it works fine).\nI have to revise this the next days.\n. I did not succeed in making the IDE run with mvn exec:... from command line (classpath problems in any variant).\nSo currently the only possibility (and this will be the only one for 1.1.0):\n- run mvn -pl Setup\nThis will make a silent offline setup with the stuff from the project. The results are found in SikulixAppData/SikulixSetup.\nI will change the docs/information accordingly. \n. type() only excepts characters found on a US-keyboard. (see docs)\ntry paste() instead.\n. Sorry, but the source code for 1.0.1 is not available.\nYou have to use it as is.\nIf you want to work with the sources too, you have to switch to version 1.1.0\n. very well documented. thanks. I will check it asap\n. Thanks. Got your script.\n. Thanks. I will check that.\n. Thanks for finding: you were right.\n. I cannot reproduce this behavior with version 1.1.0:\nfrom a test in the IDE:\nstart = time.time()\nimg1 = capture(SCREEN)\nimg2 = capture(SCREEN)\nprint \"capture and save 2 images\", time.time()-start\nstart = time.time()\nf = Finder(img1)\nf.find(img2)\nif f.hasNext():\n  print \"compare 2 images\", time.time()-start\n  print f.next()\nelse:\n  print \"no match\"\nit gives this result (time values are seconds):\ncapture and save 2 images 0.532999992371\ncompare 2 images 0.490000009537\nM[0,0 1280x800]@S(?) S:1,00 C:640,400\nBTW: the comparable durations in version 2 will be (same size):\ncapture and save 2 images: 0.170\ncompare 2 images both loaded from filesystem: 0.033\ncompare 2 images already loaded (cached): 0.008\namazing ;-)\n. yes\n. Thanks for the fixes/additions and also for the commons-exec hint (I will have a look at it). \n. Thanks for kind feedback. Motivating :-)\n. I had to revise your fix, since I had not realized, that you removed the loading of the native libraries xxxUtil, which are needed on Windows and Mac.\nI should have done some regression testing ;-)\n. answered on launchpad:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli/+question/271642\n. I am sure, that SikuliX does not actively do that.\nMust have something to do with the used Java Robot class.\nSupposing it is Win 7-64: what Java do you use?\n. Of course I will check that ;-)\n. Confirmed.\nI can reproduce this on Windows 7 and even 10.\nThe problem is due to some buggy interaction between Java Robot and Windows (not sure who is responsible ;-) \nI could not find any hint, that this is reported as a bug neither in Java nor in Windows.\nNevertheless I accept this as a bug.\nA possible solution might be to reset the mouse speed to the value before using Java Robot the first time, after a script is run or latest when the JVM running SikuliX shuts down.  \nSince this might take a while, you have to live with it currently.\nInteresting links:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9986423/java-awt-robot-changes-windows-mouse-speed\nhttp://manjeetdahiya.com/2011/06/08/control-mouse-speed-from-command-line/\n. not really clear, what you are doing.\nI suppose we are talking about 1.1.0.\npack 1 means, you have run setup with option 1 and selected only the JRuby option. This allows you to run Ruby scripts from inside the IDE or from command line using runsikulix.cmd -r ...\nIn both cases require 'sikulix'; include Sikulix is not needed, since it is done internally at script run.\nNo extra JRuby is needed here, since it is bundled with sikulix.jar. \npack 2 means you have run setup with option 2, which gives you a sikulixapi.jar. To run Ruby scripts, you need an extra JRuby (e.g. version 1.7.22 or the new version 9). A pointer to sikulixapi.jar must be on Java class path at runtime (e.g. with CLASSPATH=<path-to>\\sikulixapi.jar) and a script must have  require 'sikulix'; include Sikulix before any SikuliX feature is used.\n. I just started with some tests in JRuby and realized, that in the IDE the \"auto-require-include\" is like this:\nrequire 'Lib/sikulix'\ninclude Sikulix\njust try it this way.\n. should not happen with final version 1.1.0\n. I principally agree, but I do not think, that runsikulix.cmd is the right way, to integrate running of scripts into whatever platforms.\nrunsikulix.cmd is only some easy to use command file for non-professionals.\nIntegration should be done using the respective java command, which gives you full control over the use of the sikulix.jar to run your scripts.\nNevertheless I will check your suggestion, especially about your deletion of the local aspect and the effect of the exit command.\n. Tracked the problem down:\n- only happens with capture actions from the IDE\n- the basic feature Screen.userCapture() works\n- inside IDE the capture works, if the IDE is started from within NetBeans (run project sikulix, is run with mvn exec:exec)\nconclusion: no idea currently. Has something to do with the fact, that the IDE is started as a real Mac App and hence the state of th IDE main window (JFrame).\n. Thanks for the evaluation.\nYou are partly right: The TextRecognizer must be newly instantiated, to hand over parameters to Tesseract, that where set using OCR.setParameter().\n... but this is the recommended approach (valid for final 1.1.0):\n```\nSettings.OcrTextRead = True\nSettings.OcrLanguage = \"eng\"\nimport org.sikuli.natives.OCR as OCR\nnow set the parameters for Tesseract\nOCR.setParameter(\"classify_bln_numeric_mode\", \"T\")\nOCR.setParameter(\"chs_leading_punct\", \"\")\nOCR.setParameter(\"chs_trailing_punct1\", \"\")\nOCR.setParameter(\"chs_trailing_punct2\", \"\")\nOCR.setParameter(\"numeric_punctuation\", \"-,.\")\nOCR.setParameter(\"unrecognised_char\", \"@\")\nOCR.setParameter(\"tessedit_char_whitelist\", \"0123456789\")\nnow read some text\nnumber = someImage.text()\n```\n... meaning that Tesseract parameters (excluding language and datapath) issued using \nOCR.setParameter()\nare recognized with the next Region.text() calls, until changed again.\nBE AWARE: when running scripts in the IDE, on rerun (even with another script), the last settings are still in effect\nI will put this to the docs.\n. ok, after having tested again:\n``` OCR.setParameter()\nseems to be in effect simply for the next following Region.text() without any additional measures.\nTR.reset() indeed does not have any additional effect for the Tesseract parameters.\nI think it is only needed, if you want to change the language and/or the tessdata folder location.\nThis makes sense, because \nTR.getInstance()\nsimply does nothing, if TR is already instantiated (TR is a singleton class).\nI have changed my above comment accordingly.\n`````\n. ... and now I have found the secret behind TR.reset():TR.reset()can be used to unset all parameters.\nBut to allowOCR.setParameter()` to work at all, TR must be instantiated.\nSo this will reset the TextRecognizer and then accept OCR.setParameter() as expected:\n```\nSettings.OcrTextRead = True\nSettings.OcrLanguage = \"eng\"\nimport org.sikuli.natives.OCR as OCR\nimport org.sikuli.script.TextRecognizer as TR\nreset the TextRecognizer\nTR.reset()\ninstantiate it\nTR.getInstance()\nthis will work with an empty whitelist even on rerun in IDE\nreg.text()\nswitch OCR to numbers only\nOCR.setParameter(\"tessedit_char_whitelist\", \"0123456789-.\")\nreg.text()\n```\n. Have a look at the setup log file: everything ok?\n- looks like a not correctly assembled sikulix.jar\n- debug level 3 is sufficient\n. Just accidentally got the same error:\nIt seems to happen when debug level is set to 4 using\n-d 4\nSo use \n-d 3\nand it should work.\n. Sorry, you seem to not have seen my above comment.\n. just try this\n-jar /home/andy/zzapps/sikuli11/sikulix.jar -d 3 -r /home/andy/z_Shift_Report.sikuli\n. This is a well known and documented behavior since beginning.\nsee https://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli/+faq/933\nIn your case, you simply should have used paste() instead of type()\nNevertheless it is on the list for version 2, to enhance the type() feature (as feature write() )\n. Sorry for that, but with current version 1.1.0 the mentioned solutions are the only that are available.\nPossible improvements will only get available during the next months with pre-versions of version 2.\nYou might try to make your own experiences with the Java Robot class or other Java based solutions, that might be available in the net.\nIf you do that and have questions, then you are welcome, to come back.\n. wow, looks like some work.\nIs it tested sufficiently, so I can just merge it without having a bad conscience ;-) ?\nI want to release the 1.1.1 before end of 2015.\n. ok, thanks. have some overload currently ;-)\n. Makes sense.\nUntil now people had to use\nkeyDown(modKeys)\ntype(something) // no modifiers \nkeyUp()\n... but for me, your patch has too many lines ;-)\nthe relevant change is the move of the modifier handling out of the loop.\nI will add it.\nThanks\n. Thanks for the pointer.\nI accept this as a doc-bug, in the sense, that I should mention, that in both cases there are possible solutions. But I will not add any pointers to anywhere - I will just say: scan the net for more information.\nIf this is not enough for you, feel free, to prepare appropriate information and post it here, so it might be available to others.\n. Thanks.\n... coming right back from the future ;-)\n. After having looked into your modifications to allow unicode input, I decided to not put it into version 1.1.1\nI do not have the time to test it in all aspects on all system variants.\n... and I do not have the time to document it accordingly, so it can be used seamlessly and from scripting too.\nI will incorporate it into version 2 while completely revising the Key/Keyboard implementation.\nGreat thanks anyway for your contribution.\n. agreed.\n. I have to check\n. Thanks for finding.\nI have to admit, that I never did nor had a chance, to test this helper feature on a system having your environment.\nDo you get a resulting build commandfile?\nIf yes, just modify and run it to success. Then tell the setup, that you have a working libVisionProxy.so.\nIf not, come back.\n. please give an example\n. --1. use exists(img, 0) instead of find ...\n... especially when looping with samples to find the match on the current screen. this avoids the standard waiting time of 3 seconds, if the current sample is not the match.\n--2. restrict the region ...\n... which is the most effective way, to reduce searching time.\nin your case you might once search for the match region containing the constant label text (Identity: SSH Arguments: Terminal Profile:) and then define relative region above, where you expect to find your samples.\n\n--3. as little background as possible\nyour sample has to much of black background.\na better sample:\n\n--4. use a high similarity\nEspecially for these situation it is vital, to use a similarity as high as possible (even exact()) might be suitable.\nTo understand what happens:\nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basicinfo.html#sikulix-how-does-it-find-images-on-the-screen\nanother option might be to try with text search.\n. thanks.\nhighly appreciated.\n. [error] Can't initialize global Robot for Mouse: headless environment\ndo you really run in a headless environment?\nNOT possible !!!\n. That might be, but you might run into other problems, when using SikuliX features, that need a real screen attached.\n. thanks for the confirmation. all the best,\n. > A cool feature for SikuliX2\n... you will get it ;-)\n. This usually means, that some code junks are too large for Jython to parse (should be 64 KB max).\nI cannot tell you, why that only happens with Jython 2.7 (might be due to unicode support).\nSolution: find out, which part is too large and divide into smaller parts (might be modules)\n. with version 1.1.0 ??\n. passing lists of images to exists() is not defined and not checked at the API level.\n... but the error message should be enough for now:\n[error] Region: doFind: invalid parameter: ['hire.png']\nin version 2, I will do it better ;-)\n. -- I mean it really takes a lot of time to debug this error.\nok, understood and agreed: SikuliX should not silently crash, but show some reasonable error behavior.\nI will fix it in 1.1.1\n-- feature to check multiple images at once\nThis feature will completely be available only in version 2.\nCurrently there is an experimental base implementation, to search for multiple targets in parallel (faster only with more than 3 targets compared to a serious of exists).\nRegion.findBest(img1, img2, img3, ...)\nand returns the match with the highest score.\nIf you urgently need such a feature with 1.1.x at the scripting level, then I recommend, to implement your own threaded solution, that can handle a bunch of targets in parallel using exists(img, 0)\n. > API to reach for external services (like neural network service)\nDo you have an example for me of such a service.\nSupposing it is used by issuing some RESTful http requests: I added a feature in 1.1.1, to issue http requests based on Apache org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient.\nThe API will be in App class. \n. > Issuing requests is not a problem for Python. \nI know of course ;-)\nYou might implement the complete SikuliX in Python - no problem at all.\nBut with SikuliX features I have to think at the Java level due to history and intended availability.\n. > but http://demo.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/ is the showcase of technology that could be exposed.\nok, understood and interesting.\n... but this currently is surely not one of my priorities.\nVersion 2 will have easier possibilities to add \"plugins\". So something like this might be a candidate.\n. I do not want such information in the README.\nPlease post as issues (as you did with version 2), so it can be discussed and tracked.\n. your mail (your github) does not work:\nDelivery to the following recipients failed: shantonu_oxxford@yahoo.com\n----- content\nHi,\nI have switched your README pull request to an issue.\nI would appreciate, if you would comment some of your statements a bit \nmore in detail, to get them clearer about the intention.\nSee my comments. \nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/issues/202\nRaimund\n. ok. thanks\n. I could reproduce your problem on my MacBookPro same OSX.\nIn about 7 of 10 types one character was out of sequence.\nApparently the behavior of the search field has changed.\nAs always in such situations inserting short wait()s make things more robust.\ntype(\"f\", KeyModifier.CMD + KeyModifier.ALT); wait(0.5)\ntype(shortidentifier)\nthis raised the number of correct types to 100%.\nAs long as the Java AWT Robot internally is used, to type to the GUI, such situations can always happen, since internally there is no feedback possible about what really happens in the GUI.\n... but since the beginning of Sikuli inserting short wait()s in problematic sections in most cases have made the workflows more robust.\n. what is\n\nexporting a p12.\n. ok, but that does not look special in any way.\n\n... and \n\nIt seems it also doesn't always work\n\nis not very specific about the symptoms and the point where it does not work anymore.\n... and if it has something to do with the above mentioned quirk, then you cannot do anything with SikuliX anyway.\n. Talking about SikuliX IDE?\nnot planned to do anything in this direction.\nVersion 2 will use JEdit as bundled scripteditor, that has all these features.\nIf you need such aspects, you should use real IDE's like Eclipse and PyCharm. In parallel you can stick with the SikuliX IDE to manage your images.\n. please try again, made some fixes.\n. thanks for feedback. I will check the JRuby problem.\n. working on it\n. I think I finally fixed it now (being on the VNCScreen was not propagated to the resulting matches, hence the DeskTopRobot was still used).\nSince I cannot test it live (no VNC setup available), I would highly appreciate for some testing and feedback from your side. thanks.\nBe aware:\n- findAll() matches might still not work\n- use VNCScreen.newRegion()/newLocation(), to force the resulting objects to the remote screen.\n- the features, that create new Regions/Locations from existing Regions/Locations should propagate the \"remote knowledge\" (like Region.above(), Location.offset(), ...)\n- using Region/Location.isOtherScreen() shows true for elements on the remote screen\n- in doubt use print/toString() on an object, the screen now shows VNC for a remote\nvnc.toString(); // VNC(0)[0,0 1024x768]\nvnc.find(img).toString() // M[11,64 130x28]@S(VNC(0)[0,0 1024x768]) S:1,00 C:76,78 [177 msec]\n// a match on the desktop: M[11,64 130x28]@S(S(0)[0,0 1024x768]) S:1,00 C:76,78 [177 msec]\nexample:\nIterator<Match> matches = vnc.findAll(someImage);\nwhile (matches.hasNext()) {\n    Match m = matches.next();\n    m.hover(); // might still be on desktop\n    vnc.newRegion(m).hover(); // should definitely happen on the remote\n}\nI will trigger a new nightly build later. \n. Does the mouse move to the location on the VNC screen?\n. ... and now the desktop mouse should not move anymore in this case. Correct?\n. ok, then this is some problem in the VNCScreen/VNCRobot area or with VNC itself.\nI do not have the time currently and no ressources (no VNC setup) to test this in depth.\nFor now I have to leave you alone with it.\nBut if you have any new information or suggestions: welcome.\n. ok, thanks for your cooperation.\n. For now the VNC handling has got some convenience wrapper (scripting: vncStart(), Java: VNCScreen.start()) to start one ore more VNCScreen sessions. At end of scriptrun or JVM exit all running VNC sessions are auto-stopped. This is tested from Mac towards Windows TightVNC server and as loopback on Windows.\nsee: \nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screen.html#connecting-to-a-vnc-server-vncscreen \n. should work now.\nsee: http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screen.html#connecting-to-a-vnc-server-vncscreen\n. I understand your request.\n... but the 1.1.x series is not in a shape to be built easily from sources.\nThis is mainly due to the pre-built native code, that cannot be simply built on the fly.\nBut if you want to give it a try, there is a target 1.1.0:\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/releases\nBut be aware: even if you \"build from sources\", the generated jars are not useable without having run a setup (you might do this within the project context) or using it in a Maven project setup, that produces uber-jars. \nVersion 2 will be more \"normal\" in this sense.\n. ... nevertheless, when I decide the next days, that the 1.1.1 is final, then I will start the 1.1.2 bug fix release in a new branch.\n. May be I am dreaming, but I thought, that I already signaled to be happy to take over (see Twitter).\n. ???\nWhere do I have to look?\n. ok, now I understand, what you did.\n... but I cannot find any notification, that allows me to take over.\n. as a fallback:\nI have downloaded the zip of the repo, so I can setup my own from that.\nSo if it is not possible/suitable for you to recover the transfer, just purge the repo.\nI wait for your decision.\n. I think I am now able to fly on my own:\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1-Chocolaty\nI will give you a note, when I need some help.\nthanks for now.\n. @AnthonyMastrean \n... also thanks for you efforts.\nseems to be a chance for me, to learn more about using Powershell ;-)\n. Highly appreciated.\nA template for the principal approach can be taken from the VNC implementation in the contributed package module API::edu/unh/iol/dlc.\nThe relevant classes are\n- VNCScreen (screen as region, capture, ...)\n- VNCRobot (mouse and keyboard)\nFor both there are Interface classes (IScreen, IRobot) that define the methods to be implemented.\nRecently I added some docs and conveniences, which might help too having a look at (http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screen.html#connecting-to-a-vnc-server-vncscreen)\nIf you give me some more detailed information about what you already have, I can give more precise instructions what to do and how.\nAs a start, just make a fork of this repo to work with. So I can have a look and suggest or even create pull requests.\n. Thanks. I will have a look the next days.\n--- The IDE has screen capture functions to vnc?\nno.\nyou have to write your own capture script or program.\n. In fact I am a bit short on time currently due to other private priorities, so you have to wait for another few days. \nI hope, this is acceptable. Thank you.\n. @tg44 \nI would highly appreciate if you tell me the steps, to get an environment to check your work either on Mac or on Windows:\n- what packages to install\n- what IDE to use (currently I prefer InteliJ IDEA CE)\n- any configuration hints\n- I have a Nexus7, if this is of any use for that \nBE AWARE: I do not have any Android dev knowledge.\nThank you\n. thanks, will try ;-)\n\nso I have no idea if I could integrate it properly to sikulix or it has bugs.\n\nI accept that is to some extent my job.\nBut I still need some days.\n. @tg44, @jivank \nI just started to look at the work of @tg44 \n- I am currently on Mac 10.11\n- successfully installed the ADB package with Homebrew (my standard package installer)\n- made my Nexus 7 accessible (switch on developer mode)\n- added the org.sikuli.adroid package to this project\n- made some basic tests: works :-))\nThen I started to completely revise the classes and added a class ADBDevice where all the device features are handled. The ADBClient is reduced to a singleton class, with only static features (handling the connection to the adb server and managing the list of attached devices).\nADBScreen initializes to represent a device and ADBRobot delegates to the device, that is representing the related screen.\nThe major revision goal is to take care, that a screen-device-relation can internally be handled as a singleton, to allow to make it thread safe later, in the sense, that on one device at any time only one action can be done (which is vital for the observe feature).\nCurrently saying:\nADBScreen adbScreen = new ADBScreen();\ngives a Region/IScreen object, that is backed by an attached device at position 0 in the devicelist (if any).\nWhen I finish my revision tomorrow, the basic Screen and Region features will work.\nfor the usage in the IDE as default screen, my idea is to add a menu entry \"Android\" in the Tools menu, that allows to make this switch:\n- list attached devices\n- select one as default screen\n- ...??\n. I just pushed my revision of the package org.sikuli.android.\nThere is an ADBTest class, that can be run.\n- adb must be installed and useable\n- a device must be attached to USB\n- the device is waked up if needed and unlocked by a swipe up\n- a swipe left and a swipe right is done (only makes sense if the menu screen is visible)\n- you get a chance to capture something on the device's screen shown on your workstation's screen\n- the capture is then searched on the device's screen capture\n- if found, the target is tapped on the device\neverything is very experimental and based on my Nexus 7 (Android 6.0.1) running on Mac OSX 10.11.\nThe capture is rather slow (average 5 seconds) using capture -p. Using capture (returns the raw pixel bytes) cuts down to 2 seconds and less, leaving the image conversion to the host (some 10 milliseconds): see https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/commit/016977586ca92ae3cbe4f9e81beca7487d337353. Nevertheless it seems to be needed, to insert many waits, to not sending requests faster, than the device changes the screen content or has finished with the last request.\nI take this state as some \"proof of concept\" and stop the development for now, since I want to make the 1.1.1 final now.\nThen I will add a development branch with version 1.1.2., where we could go further.\nThen maybe I will come back to the idea of adding a feature branch for the Android stuff.\n. Yep, this solution is surely not for game automation (as it is used frequently on workstations).\n... but it is rather acceptable for some basic workflows and even some testing, that is allowed to run for some minutes or hours ...\n... and that it runs out of the box (only adb must be available) is a big advantage.\nAbout WiFi: I know and will probably try it out the next days.\nBTW: I added the internal use of dumpsys to get some state and config information (display on/off, screen size), but I am aware, that this might be version dependent to some extent.\nI decided to add the device specific actions (tap, swipe, ...) to the ADBScreen and directly delegate to the ADBDevice, so the ADBRobot is only needed if you use the workstation specific actions like click.\nIn the IDE this works for now:\nimport org.sikuli.android.ADBScreen as AS\nuse(AS()) # set as default screen \nwakeUp(2)\nswipeLeft()\nswipeRight()\n. @jivank Exactly ;-) I added a menu entry in the tool menu, \n- where you can see, wether a device is accessible via adb(currently only the first one in the device list)\n- where you can run a test against the device including capture/find/tap\n- where you can switch the image capture to address the device screen\nIf you want to run a script against the attached device: see the comment above.\nThe next days I will write something about usage, restrictions and next steps somewhere.\nBe aware:The current device capture, using the png-capture command (capture -p), is rather slow (see above). This then is the main duration influence for the find ops. I started to experiment with the so called raw capture, that promises more speed (up to 10 times faster capture), since it allows, to move the post processing of the raw pixel bytes to the host machine (where we talk about milliseconds and not seconds).\nAll this currently happens on Mac OSX 10.11 with my Nexus 7 (Android 6). I have no idea (and no chance to get any) how all this looks and feels on newer devices.\nThe stuff is available in the next nightly build 2016-07-15 (package org.sikuli.android).\nAny feedback and ideas are welcome.\n. @jivank\n... and yes, this will be implemented for the VNCScreen too later.\n. Capture now uses raw capture on the device, which makes it a lot faster: \nsee commit: https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/commit/016977586ca92ae3cbe4f9e81beca7487d337353\n. Just checked a device connection over WiFi:\nAt least in my test environment the capture is unacceptable slow (30 seconds).\nUntil someone tells me a solution for that, I will not test any further with WiFi connections.\n. Finalized the Android support for now in this experimental state as some proof of concept:\n- IDE tool menu to run a short test on an attached device and to switch to an Android device for image capture and back to the default local screen again\n- running scripts towards an attached device with the possibility, to restrict the search region to smaller parts of the device's screen\n- on my Nexus 7 (1200 x 1920) a search on the whole screen runs less than 2 seconds, on only portions of a screen 1 second and below down to 200 milliseconds \n- click is converted to a tap and the ADBScreen already knows tap and swipe (no timing yet)\n- adb must be available on the host and must be executable from command line using adb\nThis is a sample script:\n```\nfrom org.sikuli.android import ADBScreen\nDebug.on(3)\nascr = ADBScreen.start() # get the one attached device\nif not ascr:\n  exit(1)\nuse(ascr) # set as the default region\nascr.needsUnLock = False # see comment\nwakeUp(2) # take care that the display is on, wait max 2 seconds\ngsearch = \"gsearch.png\" # to detect home screen\nimg = \"img.png\" # an icon to tap\ntop = newRegion(Location(0, 0), 300, 300) # top left corner\niconRow = newRegion(Location(0, 600), 1200, 300) # an icon band\nfor i in range(3): # just do it 3 times \n  key(ADBScreen.HOME) # tap the home button\n  top.wait(gsearch, 10) # wait for home screen\n  iconRow.click(img) # click icon\n  wait(5) # to give time to the triggered action to process\n```\nThe images are captured from the device using the capture button after having switched the default screen to the device in the tool menu.\nascr.needsUnLock = False: if set to true (the default), after waking up the display a swipe up is done to let a lock screen vanish. \n. @tg44  and @jchoover \nI understand, that you might have problems: be aware: it is developed on Mac and not yet tested on Windows nor on Linux.\nThe next nightly should make less problems.\nIf you give me more information, what you are doing in what environment, I might get things fixed faster.\n. @tg44 and @jchoover:ok, a comment, what I have done/fixed so far:\n- OpenCV problem: fixed\n- ADBScreen.wakeUp() now tries different patterns for version < 5 and > 4, does nothing if not possible to detect screen state (which might lead to black captures, if device sleeps)\n@tg44:I will now track down the click() problem (... and yes: tap should work)\nBTW: this is very inefficient and risky:\nwait(\"asd.png\", FOREVER) # if it does not appear, you have to kill the IDE\nclick(\"asd.png\") # does a costly additional search\n... better:\ntap(wait(\"asd.png\", 20)) # gives up after 20 seconds or taps the found match\n@tg44 I will fix the rotated problem of course ;-)\n@jchoover ADBDevice/ADBRobot: as mentioned already before: IMHO it makes more sense to implement the device specific actions in ADBDevice. I will check, what else should be delegated from Robot to Device. \n. watch out for the next nightly build 2016-07-18\n. @tg44 \njust checked the situation \"device rotated to landscape\":\nas long as you take care, that it is in landscape before starting the script, everything works fine for me.\nI did not check yet, what happens, if you rotate the device during a scriptrun.\nuse ADBScreen.reset() at the beginning of a script, so that you always start with a new device connection.\n. revised/added:\n- device start/init/wakeup\n- input (input text) and delegation of Region(type)\n- click() did not target the device\n. you should update getting the fixes from yesterday including the implementation of type and the alternative input() in ADBScreen.\nI do not have any problems with capturing smaller parts of a screen.\n. @jivank \non linux systems you have to care for the prerequisites like OpenCV yourself.\nsee: http://sikulix.com/quickstart/#qs3\n. @jivank \nOk, I did not know, that you are using the experimental Android support.\nThis was never tested on Linux yet.\nThe problem here is, that one needs a library file called something like libopencv_java248.so, which bridges via JNI between the OpenCV Java API and the native OpenCV libraries.\nSince you seem to know what you are doing:\nFind out, wether you can get this library via apt or otherwise\nSince I am currently on vacation, I have no chance to check this on my Ubuntu before beginning of September.\n. You might also try to add a link libopencv_java248.so pointing to libopencv_java249.so\n. ok, I will check after beginning of September (still one week on vacation ;-)\n. @jchoover thanks for your evaluations and suggestions.\nAs mentioned: I will check and surely repair somewhen next week.\n. @kainecy \nsorry, just an experiment - not complete at all and not documented.\nIn doubt you have to look into the code.. @Umriyaev \ngreat thanks.\nI will add the fix.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1662784. @Umriyaev \n... misspelled: copy & paste is still not intelligent enough ;-)\nAgain thanks: corrected and added the tap fix.. @kainecy \nHope I get it managed today. So watch the nightly page wether a new build is available.\nHaving setup your Maven correctly, the new snapshot should be pulled automatically on the next clean install.. very productive ;-) thanks again.\n. The ADB feature is experimental and there are currently no plans for more features.\nFeel free to overwrite and extend the respective classes meanwhile.. @pepijnve \nGreat thanks for coming up with that.\nOf course is any PR welcome, that enhances SikuliX features or even adds new ones.\nSince the current implementation in 1.1.x does not and will not have any regression tests, I usually take the risk of merging even larger changes after some basic evaluation (just eyes on ;-).\nGPL-2.0 license as far as I understand, fits to the MIT license of SikuliX.\nSince I guess that only the viewer jar (500+ MB) is needed, it would be the easiest to just add it to the SikuliX sources, like I already did with other stuff. \nSo I just suggest, you first make a PR for your code changes and then lets decide further, after I have understood your solution.. @mitec \nI do not use any vnc server on Android nor do I know anything about it. It is up to you, to test the SikuliX vnc client against whatever vnc server wherever.\nThe device access via adb is experimental.. @mitec \nios?????????????????????\nsee: http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screen.html#connecting-to-a-vnc-server-vncscreen. @mitec \nas mentioned: SikuliX only offers a vnc-client based on the TigerVNC sources. \nSetup the server and connecting correctly is completely up to the user of SikuliX.\nMy tests of the client run against a free version of RealVNC's VNC Server on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 64-Bit.. Thanks for the Info - highly appreciated.\nI will have a look at the \"minor issue\".\n. UNC path something like this?\n\\server-access-token\\folder\\folder ...\n. I just looked into the code and decided to not fix this in version 1.1.x\nAs a workaround you have to assign a drive letter.\nI have it on the list now for version 2, to generally support this kind of file path specification too.\n. Sorry, no. The only framework, I will have a little more specific docs in the future is for RobotFramework and later about Selenium, since I want to support both better out of the box.\nYou have to consult the web. \n. If you are talking about the test cases feature in the IDE: yes, purged, since it was only some toy, that could not satisfy people in most aspects. It was a very specific implementation and hard to enrich with new features.\nsee: https://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli/+faq/1804 \n. which versions? SikuliX, Windows\nrun with option -d 3 and look into the degug output.\n. @brandy \nI would also be interested in your fix solution. thanks\n. @CarolCiola \nSupposing it is version 1.1.1 (http://sikulix.com)\nAs mentioned above: check your Java installation and environment/path settings. In doubt remove all existing Javas and install only one 64-bit version.. @CarolCiola \nok, thanks for coming back with your information.\nI will check wether the bundled stuff is different and fix it.. when importing a xxx.sikuli script, the folder xxx.sikuli is also added to the imagepath. \nSo to check your imagepath add this after the print \"import done\"\nfor entry in getImagePath():\n    print entry\nIn your case, you seem to have an imagefile with the same name in a different .sikuli folder.\nThe search on the imagepath stops with the first matching filename.

Hence it MUST be contained in the IDE jar.\nIf you want to use SikuliX features in a Java aware scripting environment (Jython, JRuby, Scala, Groovy, Clojure, ...) with your own setup, you need a valid sikulixapi.jar, that has to be appropriately setup in your environment (classpath, import, ...). \ntypical professional usages for P(J)ython scripting\n- Jython installation\n- Eclipse with PyDev or PyCharm\nFor the other Java aware scripting situations there are similar setups depending on the used IDE.\n. ... comment on your setup options used (supposing setup runs on Linux/Unix):\nthis is appropriate if you want to setup your own scripting environment (according to the comment before):\noptions 2 3 buildv not\n... which would finally result in a working sikulixapi.jar\n. @UnitedMarsupials \n\nWhy would not it make sense to use an external jruby.jar, for example?\n\nThis was meant with respect to sikulix.jar: a package to be ready to use for non-programmers to edit and run more or less complex scripts with an IDE, which usually does not fulfill the requirements of a professional.\nFeel free, to do whatever you want with the building blocks of SikuliX (packaged or not).\nJust run a Maven \"clean install\" at the project root and assemble your own packages or use the \"naked\" jars as you like.\nI admit, that the support for linux/unix systems is poor, which is the the base for your problems.\nIf the packages created by setup would have run out of the box on your system, you would not have had anything to complain.\n. @toschneck \nCongratulations - looks good :-)\nI would highly appreciate if you change the link for Sikuli(X) in your Readme to\nhttp://sikulix.com, since you seem to be based on the latest SikuliX (1.1.x).\nall the best.\n. ok, thanks.\n... but I will not change any C++ source code in version 1.1.x any more.\nVersion 2 will not have any C++ code any more --- Java only.\n. When Sikuli was started in 2009 by the former developers, they decided to use OpenCV matchTemplate() as base for the image search. At that time the official OpenCV API was only available for C and C++. So they decided to implement the features around image search in C++. But since Sikuli itself from the beginning was implemented in Java, they had to add some bridge and decided to use JNI.\nA bit later, the approaches were changed and the basic text features (Tesseract) were also added. Altogether this is some chaos, where nearly every day I am thankful, that it still works.\n... and believe me: this code is not worth to be \"ported\" and would lead to \"crazy\" Java code if one would do so.\nWhen I took over some years ago, I decided, to not invest in C++ coding. So I restricted myself to adopt the stuff to newer versions of OpenCV and Tesseract and get it built for Windows, Mac and Ubuntu, so it is possible to provide packages, that run out of the box after setup.\nSince 3 years OpenCV provides a Java wrapper, that offers the OpenCV API at the Java level (Java classes using a mix of JNI and JNA internally, to access the native libraries).\nFor the implementation of the text features there is also a Java wrapper available (Tess4J).\nUsing these wrappers will make it possible to completely get rid of any proprietary C++ code in version 2 and hopefully get a much cleaner implementation of the SikuliX API, that is more open for contributions.\nNevertheless: I will check your suggestions and repair the mentioned source code problem.\n. fixed see above.\n. yes, possible.\nthanks for the hint.\n... done\n. Thanks\n. Currently a regression test suite is under development, which besides helping testing after bug fixing in version 1.1.x will also be the base for making sure, that version 2 will be backwards compatible.\nVersion 2 will have basic function tests available from the beginning. \n. https://github.com/RaiMan/sikuli-regression-tests\nI added a ReadMe.\n. ok thanks.\nI trust your apparent professionality ;-)\n. > Although it is delightfully innocent of any bash-isms.\nI love this remark :-) having German as mother tongue\nGreat thanks. Much appreciated.\nI will have a look and try to understand ;-)\nAnything wrong with putting it into the bundle?\n. > BTW, are there any other useful main-classes\nThe only \"real\" main-class in fact is org.sikuli.ide.Sikulix.\norg.sikuli.script.Sikulix can be used with option -s to start an experimental runserver (not yet in the docs and not complete). You should ignore it ;-)\n. what version of SikuliX?\n. So the shown dialog comes from your script I suppose.\nplease paste the relevant part\n. at 1: just checked on my OSX 10.11.5: IDE 1.1.0 works. So you should check your Java setup.\n... but use of 1.1.0 is not recommended on Capitan anyways.\nat 2: Retina? do the used images come from a non-Retina display? You have to track that down somehow.\n. Ok, you should purge everything belonging to SikuliX package (the app, the installation folder and the app data folder).\nDownload the 1.1.1 setup and run it, to get a surely clean 1.1.1\nIn case of problems run from command line using\nrunsikulix -d 3 -c\n. use 1.1.1\n. looks like some mixup of versions.\nYou should delete the folder:\nC:\\Users\\Rakesh\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sikulix\nand start allover new, putting the the downloaded setup jar into a folder like c:\\SikuliX as recommended and run it again.\nTake care, that in the environment nothing points to stuff from previous Sikuli versions.\n. Could you tell me more about why and what you fixed - just interested about ;-)\n\nbuild the equivalent version for Windows\n\nFor this I would have to dig down into my dark past (never did this again since 2013 ;-) with the risk, that I do not find anything about that anymore :-(\nMy approach in 2013:\n- a setup with msys to compile and link everything including basic dependencies from the sources (today I would use msys2, which might make it a bit easier, because more ready-to-use packages might be available)\nAs I remember, especially the Tesseract sources did not compile without errors, that needed some minor adjustments - but this might be not the case today.\nWith version 1.1.x I will not touch the native C++ code anymore.\nWith version 2 it is obsolete anyways, since I will use only ready-to-use packages on the Java level (OpenCV and Tess4J).\nSo simply: I cannot really help you in the details, since I cannot afford the effort to start allover again with this currently and until towards end of this year.\nIn the case, I find something helpful the next days, I will tell you.\n. App.open on Mac currently apparently only works, if the app-name.app is stored at the root level of /Applications.\n... and only app-name can then be used \n... but even this does not work in all cases (for me IntelliJ IDEA CE.app does not work e.g.)\nSo I am afraid, that it will not work for you.\nIf you are familiar with AppleScript, you might run AS-snippets inline in your script this way:\nan = \"IntelliJ IDEA CE\"\ncmd = \"\"\"\napplescript\ntell application \"%s\" to activate\n\"\"\"\ncmd = cmd % an\nreturnCode = runScript(cmd)\n... which would open the given app or bring it to front if it is already running.\nThen you might use App.focusedWindow(), to get the region of the app's frontmost window.. If you did not do any changes in the sources, then you should go to the nightly build page.\nOtherwise I need the complete setup log-file, to see what happens \n(mail to sikulix--at--outlook--dot--com)\nI will check later today, what might go wrong.\n. Thanks for the info.\nI will check.\n. I have fixed it.\nThanks again for finding.\nNew nightly available in about 2 hours.\n. @ubershy \nWas obvious and easy to fix. The rest is semi-automatic workflow ;-)\nall the best\n. Thanks\n. in the docs (what you name wiki above) there is a note on java usage, which should work.\nA given observer callback is only reassigned in case the call is coming from Jython or Ruby.\nBut anyways: the code snippet you mention above is not relevant, since the feature is implemented in class Region.\n. @cschlisner \nthanks for not giving up and finding a solution (which needs ugly redundancies), that finally convinced me of having to do some revision of code and docs ;-)\nNow it is possible to simply use new ObserveCallBack() and override the respective method, as mentioned in the docs.\nOn top I now mention in the docs the possibility to define global handlers for all newly created regions .\n. --1. be sure to use the latest nightly build 1.1.1.\n--2. the mentioned field need not be atomic, since it is a Region object value, that assures that one region can only run one observer at one time.\nSo as long as you do not try to start an observer for the same region object in different threads, there should not be a problem. \nTo make it robust for such situations, just making the field atomic is not enough. I would have to make the start of an observer thread safe together with appropriate error messages and may be additional options, that define how to react in such situations (e.g. integrate the additional events into the already running observation).\n... but this is something for version 2\nThanks for your input anyway.\n. Fine, that you did it on your own.\n\nif would have been wrote in the documentation !\n\nhere you get the hint, that something special is on Linux:\nhttp://www.sikulix.com/quickstart/#qs3\n... and later this link:\nhttp://www.sikulix.com/specials/files/linux-setup-prerequisites.html\n. this still works:\n<dependency>\n      <groupId>com.github.vidstige</groupId>\n      <artifactId>jadb</artifactId>\n      <version>-v1.0-g94ebf38-23</version>\n    </dependency>\n. - That the current SikuliX POM does not work with Gradle is a known problem and will only be fixed in version 2\n- the correct repo definition (as mentioned behind the link in your above first message) is:\n<repository>\n      <id>jitpack.io</id>\n      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>\n    </repository>\n... as mentioned: works for me.\n. https://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1410072\n. Thanks.\n... but the observe feature is not implemented in class ImageFinder (and will not be in 1.1.x).\nThis was some prework for version 2. . use version 1.1.1 and follow the instructions on\nhttp://sikulix.com. > as the first letter of type function, e.g. type(\"cmd\") is being omitted.\nUsually timing problems: add a short wait(0.3) before the type().\n\nIs there a way to debug on our own?\n\nDebugging SikuliX scripts is a challenge. usually it is the best way to use the highlight feature, which visualizes the matches. \n\nWhere are advanced examples\n\nIn the net especially on youtube there are many examples. \nGenerally there is no special situation with any kind of software, since everything is based on the pixels of images, that are shown on the screen by an application, then searched for by SikuliX and in most cases acted on with mouse and/or keyboard.\nThe challenge is to create a robust visual workflow, that drives the application exactly according to your intention.. Code compacted a little bit. Supposing, that resultRgn is a global, constant Region object, the reason for the slowdown seems not to be inside the shown functions.\nAn alternative solution without observe would be something like this:\n```\ndef validate(reg, img1, img2, waitTime):\n    isImg1 = False\n    isImg2 = False\n    end = time.time() + waitTime\n    while time.time() < end:\n        isImg1 = reg.exists(img1,0)\n        isImg2 = reg.exists(img2,0)\n        if isImg1 or isImg2:\n            break\n    return (isImg1, isImg2)\nresultRgn.wait(validatingPattern, TIMEOUT+5)\n(WINNING, LOOSING) = validate(resultRgn, winImage, lossImage, 10)\n ```\nThe function validate() could be used generally, to wait for 2 images in a region.\n. Has nothing to do with SikuliX.\nA usage problem of urllib or a bug, that might be caused by the fact, that the interpreter session is not closed at script run end and that we use Jython based on Java.\nRun your script from commandline, so you get a clean environment at each run.\n... or look for the error situation in forums like stackoverflow (urllib jython). cannot reproduce this problem with version 1.1.1 final.. great. thanks.. enhancements merged. will be in tomorrows nightly.. Uuups, looks strange and not like the intended use of observe.\nsee docs - to make observe() do anything at all, you have to define at least one expected event:\nappeared = false;\ndef handler():\n    global appeared\n    appeared = True\nsomeRegion.onAppear(someImage, handler)\nobserve(10)\nif not appeared: exit(1)\nwhich is the same as:\nend = time.time() + 10\nwhile time.time() < end:\n    appeared = True\n    if someRegion.exists(someImage): break\n    appeared = False\nif not appeared: exit(1). In 1.1.1 the observe feature is very much refurbished and free of oddities to a high degree.\nPlease read the docs, to be sure what you are doing.\nyour example above as I understand and would have implemented it using 1.1.1:\n```\nsupposing Chrome is running and frontmost app\nstrURL = \"https://www.google.com.br/\"\nscreenshotsPasta = r\"C:\\Users\\cciola\\Desktop\\Sikuli IDE\\Screenshots_Sikuli\"\nnumPrint = 0\npaste(strURL)\ntype(Key.ENTER)\nwhile not exists(\"Image.png\"): wait(0.5)\nnumprint += 1\ncapture(SCREEN).getFile(screenshotsPasta, \"Chrome_%d\"%numprint)\n```\n... no need to use observe\nIf you are sure about appearance and maximum waiting time: \n```\nonly the last part\npaste(strURL)\ntype(Key.ENTER)\nexists(\"Image.png\", 30)\nnumprint += 1\ncapture(SCREEN). getFile(screenshotsPasta, \"Chrome_%d\"%numprint)\n```\n. running 1.1.0 or 1.1.1 ???. ok, I will check it.. checked - not reproducible with latest 1.1.1\nespecially I did not find any situation with the debug output of\n[debug] capture!\nSo please make sure to use the latest 1.1.1 and in case it persists, please give more details, what exactly you are doing to get the error situation.. @pepijnve \n\nIn the original code I could not understand what the intended usage of the VNC connection pooling \n\nLOL, then we are already 2 ;-)\nWhen I made my experiments with ADBScreen, I did not find the time to get more into the details of the VNC solution. I only added the convenience start-up. So glad you did :-)\n. Licensing:\nIn parallel with looking into your solution, I will check about switching to GPLv2 or even dual licensing as suggested.\nJava 8:\nI want the version 1.1.x to be satisfied with Java 7.\nVersion 2 will need Java 8 in the long run.\nSo TigerVNC is the right solution for 1.1.x.\nLater this year I might come back to you, when I implement the non-local-screen support in version 2.. Conclusion:\nGreat thanks for now.\nIn a few days I will come back with my findings and possible comments. . Ok, I made some tests: \n - client script always on macOS 10.12\n - server on Windows 10-64 (TightVNC) or on macOS 10.12 (RealVNC)\n - Java 8 in all cases\nI made my tests in the IntelliJ IDEA project environment and with a packed jar as it is distributed as SikuliX.\nTo get the TigerVNC classes available in the packed jar, I put the jar content unpacked into the resources, so that at jar runtime the com.... tree with the class files is at root.\nBTW: the tigerVNC jar does not contain any information about licensing, so I decided to take the risk of packing the class files into the distribution until someone complains about it.\nSome findings:\n- (to be fixed) the capture() in all cases gives black images and hence any find op does not work\n- mouse actions seem to work\n- password feature works \n- (to be fixed) sessions started in the IDE keep open and in the next rerun a new session is started (possible memory leak, sessions should be reused or all stopped when script ends (cleanup))\nHope you have some ideas. Until then I will not do any debugging, but adapt your solution into version 2. . Take care: I made minor changes on top of your PR.. ok, tested with the old version: black capture images too. So might be some other reason. I will try to find out next week.. simply: vncScreen.capture() and then save the image. \nsince find also does not work in all situations (old and new version) when running the client on macOS 10.12 against Windows or Mac it looks like a more generic problem.\nI will come back, when I have tested other combinations and done some debugging.\nThanks for taking care. . Ok, thanks for the hint. Makes sense. I will play around with it the next days a little bit to get nearer to a solution.. ok, I will check.. ok, made some further tests with SikuliX version 2 (which gives me much more options for experimenting).\n- the frame buffer fill delay seems only to be a startup problem of the VNCClient\n- after the first capture successive captures show the correct content even with changes and no black areas immediately (even with screen sizes beyond 1600 x 1000)\nIn all cases I use the refreshFramebuffer with incremental false. Setting it to true does not change anything.\nIn SikuliX version 2 I do no longer work with buffered images internally, but with OpenCV Mat objects everywhere. So in the next weeks, I will check, wether it is possible, to use OpenCV Mat objects instead of buffered images in the VNCClient too, to access the FB content, which would make conversions from buffer data to buffered images and then to Mat obsolete (some 10 milliseconds saved ;-) \nI will now check, wether my findings are true with SikuliX 1.1.1 and your VNC implementation. If yes, then the startup delay should be solved internally with some waiting/repeating based on a user setting.\nVersion 2 will have an automatic detection of the frame buffer filling based on OpenCV features to detect content changes (which I already used for my testing now).. I now finalized the stuff. Will be available tomorrow.\nI added a feature, so that open connections are closed on script run end in IDE and revised the start methods to be more backwards compatible.\nI will not add the F5 patch, but instead put a note in the docs, about possible problems with the first access to the frame buffer (capture, userCapture and find ops), to add an appropriate wait() after the vncStart() in this case ( here in my local net it was 3 seconds before userCapture and 2 seconds before the first find op).\nThanks for your comment on OpenCV usage.\n... and again great thanks for this valuable contribution. I learned a lot and got some new ideas about how to add such features in version 2 as extensions (which will also make the license problem obsolete).. thanks.. thanks. This might look odd for version 1.1.x, but is so by design and will not be changed.. Yes, it is a Retina only problem (I am working on a Mac Book Pro Retina myself ;-).\nBe sure to at least use the latest SikuliX version 1.1.1 and run at least Java 7.\nBased on the explanation in your other question: You have to live with it.\nA general workaround is to only use the SikuliX IDE to manage the images in modules and use e.g. PyCharmCE for scripting (with tons of additional features of a mature IDE) and import the image modules or use the image path feature. Of course then you will not see the images anymore inline in your code, but a good naming convention could help.. Years ago I started with NetBeans (I never liked Eclipse ;-). Last year I switched to IntelliJ and I am very satisfied with my decision.\nPyCharm is really a good IDE for Python especially when you are used to the IntelliJ stuff.\nSince I am currently busy with the basic implementation of script running in version 2, I will take the chance to write down the steps, to get PyCharm working with SikuliX.\nFor you and now the initial steps (assuming you are familiar with the IntelliJ basics):\n - install jython, so it can be run from command line (on Mac I recommend to use homebrew to get it: simply: brew install jython), but you might also use the installer from the jython homepage.\n - check on a command line that it works: jython\n - in PyCharms in the default settings (Preferences) in the Project Interpreter section activate Jython as interpreter (add local and navigate to /usr/local/bin/jython)\nthe following steps are needed for every project:\n - create a new project and take care, that jython is selected as interpreter\n - add at least one .py file (here test.py with one line print \"hello\")\n - goto EditConfigurations and add a new Python config, again take care that Jython is the Interpreter\n - (for the first project ever, you should now run this config and should get the printout hello)\n - in the config edit the environment variables and add an entry as\nCLASSPATH <path-to-sikulixapi.jar>\n - save the config with OK\n - in your test script add the lines\nimport org.sikuli.script.SikulixForJython\nfrom sikuli import *\npopup(\"Hello from SikuliX\")\n - again run your config - you should get the popup \nThese are only the basics: to get rid off the errors about not found SikuliX features some more has to be done (but it is the same as with Eclipse PyDev).\nI simply switched these error messages off ;-)\n. Since the Sikuli IDE is a nearly 8 years old artefact on the Java Swing/AWT level 1.6 created from base by the former developers, that is not really prepared to get enhancements easily, I decided, to freeze the features in the version 1 line 3 years ago: to much effort.\nSo no, there will not be any enhancements in this direction.\nIf you have problems with huge scripts, then best practice is to divide it into smaller peaces (modules) and use the import feature based on classes/functions (see: http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripting.html#importing-other-sikuli-scripts-reuse-code-and-images) and/or use the run feature to run a module from another one (see: http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripting.html#running-scripts-and-snippets-from-within-other-scripts-and-run-scripts-one-after-the-other)\nVersion 2 will support different existing mature editors together with an external image tool. A few of these editors (e.g. jEdit) will get the \"show the images in the script\" as a plugin. . Thanks for finding:\nmade a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1687263\n... and will fix it in version 1.1.2. fixed per today: see\nhttps://raiman.github.io/SikuliX-2014/nightly.html. Thanks for the pointer. Licensing in general is surely a problem in SikuliX. I will fix it in version 1.1.2 and already started to fix it in version 2.\nFor now I fixed the concrete \"missing artefact\" problem in version 1.1.2 by referencing the tigervnc-viewer-jar-wrapper from version 2, which is under GPLv2.\nAppreciate testing.\n. Thanks for finding.\nFixed in 1.1.2-SNAPSHOT after 2017-05-08. Thanks for finding.\nfixed 1.1.2 (2017-05-09, Travis build 37). I am not sure, wether I understand the question:\nI cannot see any import in this scenario.\nOn the other hand: import is not the recommended way, to run other scripts (import is a means to make classes, methods and names available in more than one environment: write once - use multiple times).\nThe feature to be used in your case is:\nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripting.html#running-scripts-and-snippets-from-within-other-scripts-and-run-scripts-one-after-the-other \nBack to your RFW question:\nMight be a misunderstanding, but it is a basic decision, wether to use SikuliX Python scripting for your tests OR use RobotFramework for your tests. In the latter case the top level element is a .robot and the keywords might be implemented using Python scripting, where you now might use import for already implemented keywords.\nSo please rethink your situation and come back with an example, of what you are missing.. see:\nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basicinfo.html#sikulix-how-does-it-find-images-on-the-screen. Sorry, but the text feature is unchanged since 5 years and is very weak.\nNo chance to do anything.\n... take it or leave it ;-). Version 2 will be based on Tess4J which wraps Tesseract 3 as a Java API. All possibilities as with the Tesseract command usage will be available for OCR. But I will touch that area only later this year. \nAll this has nothing to do with OpenCV. And no one else, than the developer(s) of Sikuli(X) can be addressed about this \"issue\", since it is how the Tesseract feature usage is implemented deep down in the Sikuli C++ djungle (I will never touch that ;-). . already tried:\nhover(image)\nwait(someShortTime)\nclick(). @glitchassassin \nThanks for the comment ;-) Too fast 4 me ;-). @kenorb \n\nSo what's point of click(some_img) syntax (having image to find as argument), when you need to still hover on the image and click it.\n\nThis is only to test possible timing problems with your GUI.\nHover moves the mouse pointer to the location (your image in this case).\nThis \"mouse over\" might be registered by your GUI.\nthe region.click() just clicks the last match in region.\nAnother option instead of region.click() would be to use\nclick(Mouse.at())\nwhich would simply click at the current position of the mouse pointer.. Full screen is  not supported, sorry.. Surely not intended ;-)\nthanks. fixed. There are some commercial products.\n... but I do not know any other free projects. Only those, that wrap SikuliX somehow.. I have to check.\nApp should interpret the given string or even list/array of strings as Python's subprocess.Popen does it. . expired. Since in the sources of SikuliX do not contain any reference to a class \n\norg.sikuli.script.Keys\n\nthe problem must be in your sources\nBefore stepping into more complex scenarios, just make a basic functional test.. expired. This is due to the internal image caching. (As long as you use SikuliX features to change image content, this is reflected)\nIn your case SikuliX is not aware of the rename, so you have to actively reset the cache:\nImage.reset();\nAfter that the used images are again loaded from the file.. workaround:\nunwrap the click(Pattern) to a \nif exists(Pattern): click(). In fact this is a bug ;-). Be sure to use the latest SikuliX 1.1.1 and have a valid Java 7 or Java 8 installation.. In this environment/usage one has to use a class based imagepath, which is still valid, when running as standalone jar.. Explanation: all these features are not yet implemented for Linux.\nSo this is simply a bug ;-). Apparently, the class-reference-imagePath does not work in a spring application.\n\nImagePath.add(new ClassPathResource(\"images\").getURL());\n\nIs ClassPathResource Spring specific or Java standard?. SikuliX 1.1.x cannot be used with OpenCV 3+, it needs a 2.4 lib version.. Thanks for the pointer.\nI will check and fix what is necessary in your sense with 1.1.2 nightly the next days.. Thanks for the pointer.\nI will check and fix what is needed in 1.1.2 nightly the next days.. Delete everything related to SikuliX setup and start all over new.. confirmed, but no solution currently.\nNot happening on ALL systems (mine works), so it might be a problem of some special software/grafics system mix.\nsee: https://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1730645. The warning about the prefs can be ignored.. Thanks again . please be more specific:\n- how do you produce an .exe and what are the contents?\n- do you have any Sikuli(X) specific settings in your dev environment?\n- what do you use for development?\n- does the .exe work on your system from a command line with a basic environment (no special settings for SikuliX)?\n- before touching any SikuliX feature in your java code, take care that a Java system property sikuli.Debug with a value of \"3\" exists (you might make it settable from outside). gives detailed log.\n- you should step up to 1.1.1 which is on Maven Central (I do not support 1.1.0 any more) . ok, understood.\nMy guess for the reasons:\nBefore packing the .exe, I suppose you are testing from inside Eclipse.\nIf yes, then at SikuliX init, to the SikuliX eco-system some stuff (e.g. the native libraries) is exported from the sikulix.jar.\nIf you then run the .exe on that system, it will see the already existing eco-system and not try to export again.\nSo it has everything at hand and works.\nThen trying to run this exe on a system never touched by normal SikuliX before, does not work, because the needed stuff cannot be exported from the sikulixapi.jar embedded inside the .exe.\nThis was my experience with launch4j 2 years ago and because I did not find an immediate solution, I stopped playing around with launch4j.\nYou might test that on your system, where the .exe works:\nRemove the SikuliX stuff before running the .exe and it should fail.\n(running some un-wrapped SikuliX features will restore the stuff from the .jar)\nIf you know, how to get something out of the .exe, I will try to help you to get on the road.. With removing \"SikuliX stuff\" I meant the folder in your application store according to \nhttp://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basicinfo.html#sikulix-system-specifics\nIf you delete at least the folder\nSikulixLibs_TIMESTAMP (the place for the exported native libraries)\nthen I guess the .exe will not work (reason see above).\nA quick solution can only be, to have the sikulixapi.jar on the system running the .exe somewhere and take care, that she place is on the java class path at runtime. In this case, sikulixapi.jar need not be in the .exe.\nMight be, that launch4j has some support for that. . Please give me a short description of your concrete solution. Thanks.. ok, thanks.\nHoped, you had a solution based on some special launch4J setup :-(\n... I have it now on the list again.\nlast question:\nwhat did you do to secure your code in the .exe?\nIn my opinion it is not safe, if you did nothing: \n- crack the .exe back to its contents\n- decompile the Java class files. > Kindly suggest how we can secure our code.\nI have no idea currently, sorry. I only wanted you to be aware of that.\nUsually people ask for the .exe variant with SikuliX scripts or programs, because they think their code would be safe against copyright violation. But principally it is not safer, as when you publish your product as a simple runnable jar file.\n. Sorry, but you have to live with that problem or fix it yourself.\nI will not touch the IDE anymore in version 1.1.x\nVersion 2 will have another solution.. 1.1.x needs OpenCV version 2.4.x libs.\nThis will remain so, since I do not touch the C++ code in 1.1.x anymore.\nFeel free, to build the SikuliX libs with OpenCV 3 after having fixed the SikuliX C++ sources.\nIf you have the solution, I will make it available with 1.1.2.. capture as little background as possible!\n... just the max rectangle inside the blue circle. Those situations are a bit tricky, but this is a possible solution:\nafter having found the base image as suggested, just check wether the heart is there in an appropriate region at the top right of the match:\nmatch = exists(baseImage)\nif match:\n    regHeart = match.getTopRight().grow(100)\n    if regHeart exists(heartImage):\n       # do what is needed\n    else:\n       # do something else. Thanks for finding, evaluation and feedback.\nThe problem is caused by the fix \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/sikuli/+bug/1742389\nwhich introduces a set() function for class Screen() and hence for the default global SCREEN object at the Python level.\nI changed this now in a way, so that an undotted set() function is no longer seen at the Python level.. fixed with 1.1.2 build 94 today. Thanks.. the final image path is not correct!\n\n.../windows10//selectlanguage ...\n\nBTW: sikuli core 1.2.0 has nothing to do with SikuliX.. If you are talking about unit testing, you have to use assert to control failed/passed of a test.. Since you catch the FindFailed without any action, the information is lost for the rest of your code.\nScreenshots of code are not very helpful, since it is not possible to copy&paste for suggestions.\nso only some meta-code:\ntry {\n    click(...)\n    return new Mainpage(sikulix)\n} catch (...)\n    return null\n}\n... and then in the test:\nassert null != selectLanguage....\n. In the future please post questions like this on the launchpad page (larger community):\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli\nYour solution looks odd to me.\n... but I am glad you are happy.. What system?\nPlease try latest 1.1.2 nightly.. as already answered to your direct mail:\nsorry, but I have nothing to do with Pyjnius ;-)\nI guess the problem is, that something like Key.SHIFT is a static constant and does not have an accessor function.\nSo autoclass does not implement the access.\nregion.click() as you use it has this signature:\nclick(String, Integer)\nthe shift-modifier according to the Java docs is an int 1.\nso try:\nclick(image, 1)\nTo verify the values in the SikuliX IDE simply use\nprint KeyModifier.SHIFT\nBut you might as well use one of the more sophisticated reflection features of Pyjnius.\nHope it helps.\n . please ask such usage questions on launchpad.. Thanks, I will check.. On Linux systems at startup the usability of the command wmctrl is tested. It is later used with the features of The App class. Apparently you have a problem with wmctrl in this xvfb-run situation (it is run in subprocess). So to check, you should run wmctrl with xvfb-run. If the problem persists, the you cannot use the App class features.\nYou might try with 1.1.2 nightly, that handles the mwctrl problem a bit more graceful.\n... but this has nothing to do with the core features of Sikuli.\nRun as\nrunsikulix -d 3 ....\nto get more debug output especially about the screen as it is seen by SikuliX\n. Thanks for your feedback.\nSorry no, I do not have any experiences with this Linux related stuff. Especially not about usage scenarios of xvfb.\nI only use it with version 2 on Travis:CI to run tests ... and it simply works ;-)\nBut may be you should more look for \"xvfb java headless\".. thanks for the pointer.\nshould be fixed with build 110. Sorry, you have to live with that.\nIn doubt you have to have a different image set for each specific environment.\nTo avoid that, a base requirement is the same resolution on each system (the image must be there with the same width and height in pixels).\nAnother recommendation is, to concentrate the images on the key aspects, that make them findable, meaning to have as little background as possible towards the edges. This makes the search more robust against theme differences.\nThe rest is dealing with the match score.\nCurrently, there are no features in SikuliX, to adjust images in any way.. Are you using the shortcuts in the lefthand bar?\nif yes, \n - try with an empty tab\n - write click()\n - position the cursor between ()\n - click the \"Take Screenshot\" button in the top bar\nWhat Windows is it?. If you want to have that, you have to script with a mature IDE like PyCharm, Eclipse PyDev, ...\nFor image management you can still use the SikuliX IDE in parallel.\nI am sorry, I will not incorporate any new features into this more than 5 years old horrible;-) bunch of code, inherited from the original developers. It is hard enough to keep this stuff running with Java 9+\nHope you understand.. This is done at the time of the final setup test now and hence only once, since if the libs folder is recreated for some reason, the tessdata folder is left untouched.\nBut I admit: the situation when running directly from the Maven stuff is not covered yet. I will finally check and decide it.\n. Not really clear, why that is needed. Currently, the text feature is completely switched of in the standard setup. The TextRecognizer should be initialised correctly, when it is used the first time, after having switched on the options (Settings).\n. Might be null, when text search is used? Correct?\n. ok, I will check this. TextRecognizer should be initialised correctly in any case \n. ",

I think it would be very useful to remove dependency for JDK in a libvisionproxy.so building. You can prepare swig-generated file and distribute it without requirements of local JDK.\n\n\n\n\nAlso take a notice that production servers are mostly RHEL/Centos and SUSE.\n. @RaiMan \nSorry, I forgot about jni.h.... Linking is possible with JRE only by full library name. But jni.h is really problem. So it is required either JDK or local copy of java headers, or minimized jni.h for swig wrapper compiling only.\nBTW, I checked both runBuildVisionProxy.sh and libVisionProxy.so. There is no awt dependency.\n. @RaiMan \nI copied files from /usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0/include to Libsvision/src/main/java/native/Vision/java. And slightly modified runBuildNatives.sh. Now it does not require JDK but use it if exists.\n``` diff\nindex 86ab966..37b725a 100755\n--- a/Libsvision/src/main/resources/runBuildNatives.sh\n+++ b/Libsvision/src/main/resources/runBuildNatives.sh\n@@ -47,12 +47,15 @@ fi\nif [ -e $JDK/include/jni.h ]; then\n   # folder(s) containing the header files\n-  includeParm=\"-I$JDK/include -I$JDK/include/linux -I/usr/include -I/usr/local/include\"\n+  includeParm=\"-I$JDK/include -I$JDK/include/linux\"\n   echo --- The active JDK seems to be in $JDK\n else\n+  includeParm=\"-I./java -I./java/linux\"\n   echo --- JDK could not be found - please set the \\\"JDK\\\" environment variable\n fi\n+includeParm=\"$includeParm -I/usr/include -I/usr/local/include\"\n+\n if pkg-config opencv; then\n   echo --- OpenCV version $(pkg-config --modversion opencv) found\n else\n```\n. @RaiMan \nI think jni.h and jni_md.h are the same for 32-Bit and 64-Bit. And there is no difference between Linuxes at least for openJDK 1.7.\n. sikulix.gem on rubygems.org has not updated. Version 1.1.0.3 does not correspond to current code of sikulix-api.jar\nEither replace ~/.rbenv/versions/jruby-1.7.18/lib/ruby/gems/shared/gems/sikulix-1.1.0.3/lib/sikulix/sikulix.rb by https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/blob/master/JRubyGem/lib/sikulix/sikulix.rb manually or wait updated gem.\n@RaiMan I guess it is required a check of sikulix_api.jar version (by data, by major version or other) in https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/blob/master/JRubyGem/lib/sikulix/platform.rb and an appropriate message in case of incompatibility.\n. SIKULIXAPI_JAR must contain filename with path.

If you have installed it please replace sikulix-related files directly in installed path by new version https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/tree/master/JRubyGem/lib I guess at nearest time the sikulix.gem will updated.\n.

This did not build the \nlibJXGrabKey.so file in the same manner, which I believe should be done.  (When one\nuses a custom g++, the grabkey library must have an rpath pointing to it.)\n. I sent the script to rmhdevelop@me.com\nHappy vacation!\n. A little research shows a problem setting focus to a firefox or konqueror window.  These windows do not appear in such a way that wmctrl can find them.    For example, we run this:\n...\napp = App.open('Firefox');\nregion = app.window(0);\napp.focus();\nand we get:\nException in thread \"Thread-4\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0\n    at org.sikuli.natives.LinuxUtil.switchApp(LinuxUtil.java:229)\n    at org.sikuli.script.App.focus(App.java:138)\n    at org.sikuli.script.App.focus(App.java:126)\nfrom LinuxUtil.java:\n...\npublic int switchApp(int pid, int num) {\nString winLine[] = findWindow(\"\" + pid, num, SearchType.PID);\nif (winLine == null) {                                                                            #### LOOK ####\n  return -1;\n}\n...\nso findWindow() does not find 'Firefox' and the result is that winLine is an empty array (not the same as null).   This begs the question, 'Why does findWindow() fail?'\nFrom findWindow() in LinuxUtil.java we have:\nprivate String[] findWindow(String appName, int winNum, SearchType type) {\n    //Debug.log(\"findWindow: \" + appName + \" \" + winNum + \" \" + type);\n    String[] found = {};\n    int numFound = 0;\n    try {\n      String cmd[] = {\"wmctrl\", \"-lpGx\"};\n      Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);\n    ...\nNow let's see what Linux returns from the shell when running wmtrl version 1.07 with\nFirefox running:\n% wmctrl -lpGx | grep -i 'Firefox'\n%\nSo you see it does not find 'Firefox'.  Why?  Let's ask xwininfo this way:\n%  xwininfo -root -tree -children\n...\n 0x6558e2 (has no name): ()  1161x1173+723+0  +723+0\n    1 child:\n    0x17000a6 \"wmctrl missing windows - Google Search - Mozilla Firefox\": (\"Navigator\" \"Firefox\")  1151x1145+5+23  +728+23\n       1 child:\n       0x17000a7 (has no name): ()  1x1+-1+-1  +727+22\n...\n(The title of my Firefox window changes with each google search but always retains the 'Mozilla Firefox' string and hence should be found by wmctrl.)   So we note a few things from the above.  First, a 'Firefox' window is present.  Second, it has been given a new parent window.  The Gnome environment, like many under XWindows, uses a reparenting window manager.  So maybe wmctrl needs to be smarter to find the 'Firefox' window.  Well, if you hand wmctrl the id of the window we want this way:\n% wmctrl -ai 0x17000a6\nIt focuses/raises a window, but not 'Firefox'.  Instead it raises my 'Thunderbird' window. The same thing happens if I use 'wmctrl -ai' to focus on the child or parent of the 'Firefox' window. So I'm of the opinion that 'wmctrl' is pretty broken for this purpose.\nWhat then do we do?   I ran this test:\n% xdotool windowactivate --sync 0x17000a6\nand this successfully makes the 'Firefox' window raised to the top of the desktop window stack and makes it the window with the focus.  Combining what we know, we can first figure out the window number and then make it have the focus this way:\n% mywin=`xwininfo -root -tree | awk '/- Mozilla Firefox/ { printf $1; exit}'`\n% xdotool windowactivate --sync $mywin mousemove --window $mywin 0 0\nThis does what we had hoped wmctrl would do.  Note the 'mousemove' command.  Its job is to help Linux users whose settings do not require a mouse click to give a window the keyboard focus. The only real trick for a user of the above command is the '- Mozilla Firefox' string.  Since 'xwininfo' is returning many windows with 'Firefox' in their names, the user has to use a name that will only find the proper window.  It turns out that 'konqueror' has the same issue and can be found with this string: '- Konqueror'\nI propose that for Linux systems that LinuxUtils.java could be modified to do the above steps.  This adds one significant dependency: xdotool.  My tests were run with version 2.20110530.1.  The 'xwininfo' command is ever-present in XWindows-based systems (later Ubuntu may not have this), and 'awk' is present in all Linux systems I have seen though its function here could easily be done in Java.\nIf you know that Ubuntu systems are performing using the 'wmctrl' method, then modifying LinuxUtil.java so that it uses my proposal when 'wmctrl' fails to return a window, might be a good approach.\n. Raimund,\nIt turns out part of my problem was due to compiling wmctrl for \n64-bits.  ( Please recall that\nwmctrl would not change focus to certain windows.) This problem, in my \nopinion a bug in\nwmctrl, causes window ids to be incorrrect.   Once I re-built wmctrl for \n32-bits it worked.\nThis is good news.  I'm not sure, however, it solves the problems caused \nby the window\nmanager settings commonly used by Linux developers where the window of \nfocus does\nnot have to be the top window on the display.\nWmctrl was not present on my Linux systems so I had to compile it. It's \nlikely others will\ncompile their own too, so don't be surprised if this problem happens to \nothers.\nHope your vacation was good.\nDave Inman\nOn 08/08/2014 10:53 AM, Raimund Hocke wrote:\n\nAbout the focus and click() problems I cannot help you currently, \nsince I will be on vacation the next 2 weeks and start testing again \ntowards beginning of September.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/issues/58#issuecomment-51635590.\n\n\nDavid M.

FYI: I released version 1.0.0 of SikuliX cookbook to Chef's Supermarket: https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/sikulix. \nI had to add jvm_args attribute to SikuliX Setup and default it to '-Xmx128m' to prevent the following issue during a setup of remoteserver: \nUnable to allocate 64064KB bitmaps for parallel garbage collection for the requested 2050048KB heap.\nThis error was on an AWS Windows 2012 R2 m3.large with Java 1.7 u67.\n.

It should be valid still.\nI don't see it as an option in the gui screenshot: http://www.sikulix.com/quickstart.html#qs3\n. I'm not sure if this is related to: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23946036\nI also found this post on Facebook that was interesting:\n``` java\npublic class JavaMemory {\n    private final int dataSize = (int) (Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory() * 0.6);\npublic void f() {\n    {\n        System.out.println(dataSize);\n        byte[] data = new byte[dataSize];\n    }\n    // Gives an error if you comment this loop\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        System.out.println(\"Please be so kind and release memory\");\n    }\n    System.out.println(dataSize);\n    byte[] data2 = new byte[dataSize];\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    JavaMemory jmp = new JavaMemory();\n    jmp.f();\n}\n\n}\n```\nThe above program gives an error when you comment out the loop\njava\n/*for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){\n    System.out.println(\"Please be so kind and release memory\");\n}*/\nMost of the people believe that the compiler gets times to clear the memory when the loop executes and the program gives the result.\nActual Reason:\nActually \"int i = 0;\" is the reason for clean execution of the code(not the for loop. Try giving just int i = 0; instead of for loop and execute). If you declare any local variable immediately after the code block, you break the strong reference to the byte[] held in the stack frame 1 before you invoke the new byte[] the second time.\nHope you liked this post.\nThank You!\n. No problem, I hope the link and post will help.  Thanks for all of your hard work.\n. This is no longer an issue with GUI removed from silent setup. Thanks for the fix.\n. @RaiMan I know you are extremely busy, but I thought I would mention test-kitchen and see you if you are interested in trying it out.  If you have virtualbox or equivalent, then sikulix setup can be easily repeated on multiple Linux platforms with test-kitchen. Let me know if you want to have a working session in setting this up.  \nChef test-kitchen setup\nInstall vagrant-berkshelf plugin following instructions: \nhttps://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf\nThen do the following:\nsh\ngit clone https://github.com/dhoer/chef-sikulix.git\ncd chef-sikulix\nchef exec kitchen converge # creates virtual box and runs setup (this can be run multiple times)\nchef exec kitchen verify # runs the serverspec tests that only test if files or directories exist at this time\nchef exec kitchen destroy # throws away virtual box\nTo change SikuliX Setup behavior, edit the attributes section in .kitchen.yml https://github.com/dhoer/chef-sikulix/blob/master/.kitchen.yml#L22\n. @RaiMan I'm able to compile libVisionProxy easy enough, the problem is I don't know how to inject it during setup.  If I place it under the libs folder, then setup will just overwrite it.  \nIs there a quick and dirty way around this?  For example; if not windows or mac, download libVisionProxy.zip, unjar, make, and copy libVisionProxy.so from dist to libs.\n. @RaiMan The chef cookbook now compiles both libraries and puts them under libs folder. I have checked this code in.  Ubuntu 12.04 compiling works great.  14.04 is another matter for jxgrabkey.  Usleep is deprecated. I will try to figure out a work around for this. I still will need some kind of work around to prevent setup from overwriting these libs if that is possible. Any ideas?\n. The libJXGrabKey is now compiling on Ubuntu 14.  Adding #include <unistd.h> did the trick: https://github.com/dhoer/chef-sikulix/blob/master/recipes/__libjxgrabkey.rb#L17\nThanks for the upcoming change. I do think libJXGrabKey should be forked to GitHub.  It has deprecation warnings  that might cause a problem with Ubuntu future releases.  Publishing it to Maven Central would also be sweet.  Then Nexus API is available to grab the RELEASE version.\nFYI; If setup on Ubuntu works, then I plan to add CentOS 6.5 and 7 to the Chef recipe.   Eventually, Mac will also be included in the mix. \n. @RaiMan do the functional tests in setup require Display on Ubuntu? \n.

The library issue I originally reported was due to libopencv-dev package not installed when I thought it was.\nI added -d 3 flag hoping the output would be more verbose, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. Is -d 3 flag on by default for silent install?\nAs for the remote server;  I could install that as a separate action if that is your future direction in 2.0.0.  Please let me how you see remote server and remote robot playing out in the future.  Will these two be combined?  \nOne more question about setup and remote server, do they require headless display to run?  For remote server service, I have xvfb with display :0 but I'm not sure that is needed for setup or remote server.  Is that assumption correct?\nThanks in advance for your help.\n. We mainly test in the cloud on AWS.  While SikuliX will work for windows by running it in the foreground via auto-login, linux doesn't seem to be a viable option without headless support.  If Ubuntu support is a distraction to completing 1.1.0 release, then I can drop it from the Chef cookbook.  Otherwise; I am more than happy to continue working out the issues.\nI will drop support for remote server until 2.0.0 release.\n. ",

But code is like this:\nCode is very basic \nimport org.sikuli.script.Region;\n....\n..\n..\nIterator iterator;\niterator = r.findAll(\"drop-down image path\"); // r is region \nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n     r.click(iterator.next());   // click on drop-down\n     if (r.exists(\"button image path\")!=null) {  // checks whether the button image present in drop-down\n          r.click(\"button image path\");\n          break;\n     }\n}\npom.xml\n   \ncom.sikulix\nsikulixapi\n1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nThis code runs sometimes perfectly. click on the drop-down correctly, but many times it fails. instead of   clicking on drop-down it click on somewhere else in unpredictable manner.\n. It fails in detecting the Drop-down image. As I said earlier problem in find-all. instead of clicking on drop-down image it clicks on somewhere else. Same code when run multiple times on same UI. Sometimes it clicks on drop-down. and many times it clicks somewhere else, instead of drop-down. Behavior is unpredictable. Findall feature sometimes returns correct Match iterator of drop-down but many times false, clicks somewhere else. \nIn actual application I used pattern with .similar(0.98). In actual application I used this:::\n r.findAll(DataObj.methodThatReturnPattern.similar(0.98));\n. ",
    "techtonik": "Cool. Do you have a release plan to know when new binaries with can be downloaded from https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/releases ?\nThis https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/milestones can be a handy.\n. Unfortunately, this doesn't describe how to select/click menu items in scripts. The info there is for already experienced users. There is no intro and no usage example for ALT modifier key (which is not the same as KeyModifier.ALT, which is confusing).\n. This info is better read from tutorial rather than from Github issue.\n\nAlt- simply is\ntype(, Key.ALT)\n\nThe docs here - https://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/keys.html#special-keys - say that Key.ALT can not by used with type. \n. That would be useful. =)\n. Good. I'd remove KeyModifier from example, because people like me often just copy code from examples without reading anything at all. It feels like the type() function reference should be linkified.\nAnd type() docs should backlink to modifier keys description. https://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/region.html#Region.type\n. no problem ;)\n. Why not to add \"run from this line\"? Is there a technical limitation?\n. Yes, but that means I have to comment and uncomment the stuff all the time, which is not convenient. I ended up splitting the script into several small files and run each other separately.\n. I don't have time, expertise and environment for a test case to fill a bug report at http://bugs.jython.org/, but if somebody finds it, it will help to make next Jython 2.7 version Sikuli-compatible.\n. There are some Python libs for that:\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/imgdiff/1.6.0\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/dfrnt/0.2\n. Nice. Any nighties or a plan for https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX2 ?\n. Thanks. Do you have plans to embed some benchmarks into Sikuli to measure all this stuff?\n. The Robot procedure is here - https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/blob/b869c87f8437c2eff31ff0bdd9cbb8678bebff4a/API/src/main/java/org/sikuli/script/RobotDesktop.java and the docs are here https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html#createScreenCapture(java.awt.Rectangle)\nIt seems that this API is unable to capture hidden and minimized windows.\n. I was thinking about some command line mode that runs some colorful patterns, tries to find them and then outputs log in some specific format. So that it could be run on different systems for comparison.\n. The previous post if about a benchmark. Benchmark should be run several dozen times to get reliable results. And the output should be easy to compare. It is also interesting to know what takes more time - taking screenshot, converting it to OpenCV format or pattern matching?\n. The whole processing loop is:\n- take screenshot (time between Robot call and returned image)\n- convert to OpenCV format used for matching (the image data is converted in memory, right?)\n- match image (time between call to OpenCV and return)\n. It is interesting to evaluate performance of all three phases.\n. So, this is for one find(someImage) call. Very nice. =)\n1. Looks like createCVMat [105 x 32]: 1 msec is for someImage - it might be possible to convert it to CMat before of screen capture cycle and cache it. Kind of 'screen literal' that can be 'compiled' statically. Interesting if CVMats can be serialized for caching and/or processing outside of SikuliX process?\n2. For comparison Is it possible to store this profiling data for finf in some structured data format, that can be compared between platforms and preserve last few (~100) in memory queue, and export if requested? Like this YAML-like format:\nfind:\n  init:\n    createCVMat: [105 x 32] 1 msec\n  repeat:\n    Screen.capture: [1440 x 900] 20 msec\n    createCVMat: [1440 x 900] 119 msec\n    Region.doFind: 396 msec\n  repeat:\n    Screen.capture: [1440 x 900] 24 msec\n    createCVMat: [1440 x 900] 118 msec\n    Region.doFind: 397 msec\n  repeat:\n    Screen.capture: [1440 x 900] 21 msec\n    createCVMat: [1440 x 900] 107 msec\n    Region.doFind: 433 msec\n  complete:\n    sum: 17 msec\n. Those repeats above can then be visualized with Box plot\n. Thanks for the feedback. I will get back to it one day.\n.

You may test this claim with https://usabilityhub.com/\n. I am not surprised.\n. @RaiMan is it possible to check it (or add as a feature to check multiple images at once)? There is a feeling that we've discussed this earlier, didn't we?\n. I mean it really takes a lot of time to debug this error. This error is not shown in IDE pane - SikuliX crashes and the error is shown in Windows console and only if debug flag is specified.\n. > ok, understood and agreed: SikuliX should not silently crash, but show some reasonable error behavior.\n\nI will fix it in 1.1.1\n\nTHanks. =)\n\nCurrently there is an experimental base implementation, to search for multiple targets in parallel \n\nI also think that SikuliX needs API to reach for external services (like neural network service) for that task, although it seems that Python can already make this possible. Only picture object needs to be serialized somehow.\n. No unified or public API that I dealt with, but http://demo.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/ is the showcase of technology that could be exposed.\n. Issuing requests is not a problem for Python. The problem is how to pass image data for matching.\n. Running visual tests are not hard, and I remember there was specific support in Sikuli for it. Was it stripped out?\n. ",
    "tg44": "This is still a bug with usernames containing non ascii characters.\n. @vyau I tried to build the project from source (with Users/username/.m2/ dependencies) with a username which contains \"\u00f6\". The IDE start is hanging on the Init scripts, and the jython's sysconfig.py l154 drops an asiic error. (I will use only jruby in the future, just mentioned this is still a bug.)\n. I just started this:\nhttps://github.com/tg44/SikuliX-2014/tree/master/API/src/main/java/org/sikuli/android\nThe IDE has screen capture functions to vnc?\nI will working on this slowly, I think I can produce a PR in this week with a limited but working functionality.\n. So I implemented a screen viewer function for ADB.\nMy only task left for a working solution is making a new button to the ide to run a macro on adb instead of screen.\nCan you help me how can I tell the scriptruner to run my IRobot or IScreen instead of the build in? Where I need to modify things? (I searched where the IRobot interface is used, and didn't find in the IDE which can be a problem... )\n. @jivank if you check out my work I added \"adb screen\" feature where you can see your device screen in a window and make subimages as patterns with the build in screen capture tool (yes, this is a little bit tricky).\nIn the future it would be nice if we can select adb devices, and not just get the default one. And it would be nice too if the adb screen would be rotateable and resizeable and the sample in the window would transformed when we use the ide. But, I just want a working solution first :D\nRoot not needed, only problem could be, that we can show only 2 frames/sec with this method. BUT you will need a properly installed adb (or at least the driver) and maybe a working adb console if you want to use my build (in theory you dont need to start a deamon by hand, but now this feature is untested :) ).\nMy problems now:\nThe ide crashes when I try to capture from the screen .\nI have no idea how can I start the script from the ide on my implementation...\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2588979 - this installs adb + drivers (to win)\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31374085/installing-adb-on-mac-os-x - adb to mac\nI'm using IntelliJ.\nIf adb is on your path adb devices will show your device (in a console). After that everything needs to be working.\nStill I only could test the adb api so I have no idea if I could integrate it properly to sikulix or it has bugs.\n. LoL 5 sec is so slow :) My best performance with this screen capture method was 2 FPS with my Xiaomi Mi2S (Android 5.0).\nThe frame rate can't be higher with this method, I will consult with the android team for more ideas but this need nearly 0 config, we are using built in features with built in tools, and its totally undetectable from appcontext.\nThanks for your work, I will check it later today.\n(BTW if you allow wifi debugging and connect your phone to the adb daemon with hand, you can use it without usb connection. )\n. Raw capture is a good idea. I think the framerate is highly depends on the device screen resolution, lower res -> higher frame rate...\nI had so much issues because of a lower version adb-server, I solved it but take me lot of time to find out that this is the actual problem. The sysdump is really ugly, my device is printing things to a console more than 1minute long.\nNow I have issues with the ADBScreen.userCapture, I have no idea why it's not working, and currently I have no time to dig more deeper to the code. (Your exception handling and logging is killing me, you are caches exceptions and logging them to \"I have no idea where\". And there is no error on the console, but the app is hanging and I know that there is an exception somewhere, but I cant find it :D )\nHow this is working (when its working)? It's give you a new window? Or how you can capture imges from the android screen?\n. I found this on ADBDevice 145:\nif (byte2int(imagePrefix, 0, 4) != devW || byte2int(imagePrefix, 4, 4) != devH) {\ndevW is 1280, devH is 720 b2i0,4 is 720, b2i4,4 is 1280 so the if is not ideal :( some device is rotated by 90\u00b0\n!((byte2int(imagePrefix, 0, 4) == devW && byte2int(imagePrefix, 4, 4) == devH) || ((byte2int(imagePrefix, 0, 4) == devH && byte2int(imagePrefix, 4, 4) == devW))) is nearly working.\nMy main problem is that my device is rotated by 90\u00b0 so I need to change W and H in some code, and because I dont have big enought screen the half of the mobile screen is never showed. Thats why I tryed to use scrollPanel instead of onscreen render :)\n. The click on the ide is not working yet as expected:\nimport org.sikuli.android.ADBScreen as AS\nuse(AS()) # set as default screen \nwait(\"asd.png\", FOREVER)\nclick(\"asd.png\")\nWait is waiting for the picture appearence on the device, but click is moving the PC cursore.\n.

Older desktops and laptops are not experiencing this issue.\nAttached is a Java thread dump of a doubleClick(Match) that hung.

Regarding the double click, it does happen, but unfortunately, the method does not complete and exit.  There is a link here regarding what I think might be happening, after looking at the source code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10766863/mouse-event-wait-freezes-when-called-from-button\nWe have a potential work around which involves using \"Settings.MoveMouseDelay = 2\" in all of our Python scripts.  Only time will tell if this work around works all the time, or only a percentage of the time. So far, it has not failed.\nThank you for looking at this RaiMan.\n. It seems like it might be a either an issue with VNCRobot.class or Robot.class not properly initializing certain objects.  The while loop on line 1265 of EventQueue.class is locking up.  Perhaps VNCRobot.class is not correctly initializing or instantiating the Robot class. It is simply doing \"new Robot().waitForIdle();\"  I am not very familiar with the Robot class, but the other implementation of IRobot.class, which is RobotRemote.class, uses an empty waitForIdle() method.  What would happen if there is effectively no waitForIdle(), where it is just empty?\nThank you.\n. Thank you for doing that, we really appreciate it.

Also does adb require root to view the screen?\n. @tg44 \nTake a look at VNCScreen:\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/blob/5f64ab2602e2550357a2569713cbbc52b6b93e70/API/src/main/java/edu/unh/iol/dlc/VNCScreen.java\nHere is how I was able to use it in the IDE:\nhttps://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/issues/193#issuecomment-216389186\nSo I suppose you can create an ADBScreen class using VNCScreen as an example. It won't work as the default screen, but at least it would be usable (and you can see if there is any bugs).\n. This is great news! I suppose the last step would menu integration with the IDE, where you can select a device from ADB and a window will popup of the live screen (so you can create images from the android screen).

    "pepijnve": "@RaiMan I had a need for authentication support in the VNC client, so I started adding that in https://github.com/pepijnve/SikuliX-2014/tree/vncauth\nAfter running into more and more limitations of the VNC client implementation, I ended up replacing the entire VNCScreen implementation with one based on the TigerVNC Java client. Would you be interested in these changes? If so I'll make a PR for this.\nSince TigerVNC is GPL licensed and not readily available on maven central, I've been thinking about replacing it with https://github.com/comtel2000/jfxvnc which is ASL2 licensed. If the license and package availability is an issue I'm happy to do that before making the PR.. Created #247 for the VNC changes.. In the original code I could not understand what the intended usage of the VNC connection pooling (ConnectionController class) was. I removed all the code related to that and replaced it with something closer to how the ADBScreen class works. The idea is that you either use VNCScreen instances in a try/finally or try-with-resources block, or alternatively in Python you can use useVnc to make a VNC screen the default one.\nI can restore the original connection pool code if necessary, but I'll need some help in understanding what it's intended purpose is.. In which situation are you getting black images? FWIW, I've been using this code in production already to connect to the console of VMs running on an ESXi server. We're using the image capture functionality to detect prompts in an installation wizard.. The issue here is that the constructor of VNCScreen returns before the initial framebuffer contents have been loaded. It sends a full frame buffer refresh request and then returns right away.\nI played around with the code a bit to see if I could somehow wait for that request to finish, but there's no clear point where you know 100% sure that it's done.\nIt would probably be better to make OverlayCapturePrompt reload the screen contents periodically (or maybe manually).. Here's a quick patch I put together to test my hypothesis. Hitting F5 on the prompt screen will grab a new screen capture. With this in place I can see the screen loading part by part on my Mac.\nrefresh.patch.txt. It's indeed an initialisation issue. On creation the VNCClient requests a full (incremental = false) frame buffer refresh from the server. This queries the initial frame buffer contents from the server.\nAfter that, each frame buffer update triggers an incremental update of the entire frame buffer.\nThe first, non-incremental request forces the server to send the entire screen contents. The subsequent incremental requests ask the server to send any updates. Setting incremental to true gives the server the freedom to only send back the changed areas of the frame buffer. Whether it does that or just sends everything over the wire again depends on the server implementation.\nDetails are in section 7.5.3 of the RFB RFC.\nUsing OpenCV Mat objects should be feasible. Client-side framebuffer updates are processed in VNCFrameBuffer. Since those writes are performed on a background thread and the reads are done on the AWT event thread, access to the back buffer is guarded by a mutex. VNCFrameBuffer#getImage makes a copy of the requested region from the back buffer so that the requesting code is free to do whatever it wants with that. That seems like a good place to copy pixel data from the back buffer to an OpenCV Mat object.. ",

    "audus": "well this is actually not a bug or error in sikuli but just a faulty error message as it didnt find the picture in our .sikuli files and for some reason gave the error with the latest imported modules path. The real problem we did find tough was that when saving a script sikulis image removal stopped reading the code at one point and therefore removed all the pictures I had implemented after that point. We dont know why this happened but it have happened 2 times but we have solved it by finding the point were it stops reading and recoding from that point(by copy and pasting between Sikuli and Word). So the first time it happened we had a code like this\n33 click(\"a.png\")\n34 click(\"b.png\")\n35 wait(\"c.png\")\n36 doubleClick(\"d.png\")\n37 click(\"a.png\")\nand when we saved it c.png and d.png was removed since sikuli removes pictures not used in the code. So we think the bug here is that sikuli reads the code wrong when saving and removing all non-duplicate files(a.png wasn't removed as it was found before line 35). we have recorded this bug in a logfile with debugging level 3.\nwe also use and print the imagepath in the code becasue the test saves the failing image in a folder if it fails but left that part out since it was just gonna be irrelavent nonsens as it all triggers after the error we came across.\n. we have found the real source of the problem and that is that we were missing a \". that made it offset all the strings and make sikuli not recognize them(or that's my guess).  But i think there should be a pop-up for syntax errors or auto-removing files with sikuli so this doesn't happen as easily for a clumsy keyboard user like me. Sorry for wasting your time Raiman but could you take this suggestion into account when making 1.1.1 or should i make this a new post for this to get considered being put in.\n. i thought of an idea where sikuli could search for \".png\" instead of strings making it recognize images even if there's a missing \" in the code. something like this\nimport re\n    p = re.compile(\"FindFailed: can not find (..png) .*\") # parentheses for capture groups\n    filename = p.match(str(exception)).group(1) # 1st match (there is only one)\nbut maybe you have already tried and considered this deeming it slow or unusable.\n. I checked out the nightly build by downloading it from the link on http://nightly.sikuli.de/#dailynews .\nBut when testing it by writing the code\nclick(\"a.png\")\nprint \"hey\"\nclick(\"b.png\")\nand then saving it making sure all images are saved and the code is runnable I then looked if the change was implemented by changing it to.\nclick(\"a.png\")\nprint \"hey\nclick(\"b.png\")\nthe problem with b.png being removed and/or being removed without a warning or abort is still there.\ni don't know if we misunderstood each other, if the build just hadn't come yet(download time was 07-05 08:55 and what i got the release was 07-05 1:00) or if its just my environment being different from yours. Anyhow i ask you again to look into this and do the same test yourself so we can implement something to help here.\n. ok then i ran into the trap and i will retry\n. Thanks so much for helping me and solving the issue!\nsidenote in pop-up you say comment when it really is a string so clarify with \"comment or string\"\n. ",
    "UnitedMarsupials": "\ndo not use the option ext\n\nThanks, I figured this much by now :) But that brings another point -- does my selecting the options at setup-time (whether through the GUI or through the command-line) merely provides for the necessary files' download, or does it somehow else \"enable\" them?\nThat is, say I do not include JRuby and Jython at setup-time... Can I still use them later by explicitly including their respective JARs on Java command-line? Something like:\nsh\njava -cp /usr/share/java/jruby.jar:${SIKULIX_HOME}/sikulix.jar org.sikuli.ide.Sikulix\nOr is it too late by then because something buried inside sikulix.jar already says \"jRuby = false\"?\nAlso, whatever options I tried with setup, the sikulixapi.jar is buried inside sikulix.jar. Given that the former is much smaller and may be useable directly (via org.sikuli.script.Sikulix), would not it make sense to keep the two separate? So that the use-cases, where only the smaller API JAR is needed, could use the smaller JAR?\nAm I wrong and the sikulixapi.jar is not actually useful for anything by itself? If it is, how do I prevent it from being included into sikulix.jar?\n. > It should never be used with an external Jython or JRuby and it does not make sense anyways.\nWhy would not it make sense to use an external jruby.jar, for example?\n\nsikulixapi.jar is the heart of SikuliX, where the features are implemented. Hence it MUST be contained in the IDE jar.\n\nSorry, I don't see, how one follows from the other. Yes, sikulixapi.jar must be known to Java VM for Sikuli to run, but that does not mean, it has to be inside the same jar. One can run, for example:\njava -cp /some/where/JXGrabKey.jar:/else/where/jruby.jar:/opt/sikuli/sikulixapi.jar:/opt/sikuli/sikulixide.jar org.sikuli.ide.Sikulix\nwhy do you insist on sticking all of the components (required and optional alike) into sikulix.jar? It may be neater to bundle them all into one file, but, if some of the components may be usable separately (jruby.jar certainly may be, for example), such bundling causes the user's machine to waste memory for no good reason...\n. > Just run a Maven \"clean install\" at the project root and assemble your own packages or use the \"naked\" jars as you like.\nOk, thanks for the pointer... I was worried, the bundling process makes some other changes inside the resulting JAR -- like setting \"jRuby = false\" somewhere. If the availability of features is determined purely by the availability of relevant JARs at run-time, then, yes, I can do whatever I want to.\n\nI admit, that the support for linux/unix systems is poor\n\nThere is nothing to admit -- you are an application programmer, stick to Sikuli. The OS-specific packagers like myself will take care of OS, well, OS-specific packaging.\n\nIf the packages created by setup would have run out of the box on your system\n\nI, probably, would have found something anyway :-) Thanks!\n. >  ... but I will not change any C++ source code in version 1.1.x any more.\nThat's not entirely fair. As long as 1.1.0 is the only available release and 1.1.1 -- the still upcoming next one, the branch should be getting fixes. Although this particular one does not seem too important -- the code obviously compiles despite the bug -- the fix is also quite trivial...\n\nVersion 2 will not have any C++ code any more --- Java only.\n\nCould you share the expected timeline and/or \"roadmap\" for version 2.0? Is it coming this year, for example?\nThat said, the decision to go \"pure Java\" seems like a forced one :) While porting SikuliX to FreeBSD and CentOS, I got the distinct impression, that C++ code is sort of a pariah and that SikuliX developers do not consider themselves C++ programmers.\nThe two \"native\" libraries used by 1.1.x are JXGrabKey and VisionProxy. Because the former is a separate project, why not simply list it as a requirement (on Unix/X11 systems)? People like myself, who do software-porting and packaging for a living (and/or as a hobby), would find it much easier to provide it separately -- and you will not have to struggle providing it yourself (and gratuitously limiting the number of supported OS as a result)? For example, as part of my work porting SikuliX to FreeBSD, I've already created a separate port for JXGrabKey.\nAs for VisionProxy, it does not seem useful to anything other than SikuliX, so I simply compile it as part of the SikuliX build -- but not through Maven. I also patch SikuliX code to use System.loadLibrary() instead of System.load() -- this allows the locations of the shared objects to be specified via the standard means (like LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix) and removes the guessing names of the library-files (like does it end with .dll or .so or .dylib?).\nSo, if your decision to go pure Java was driven -- at least partially -- by the problem of porting C++ code, a better solution may be to leave that porting to others. Concentrate on your own code and simply list that of the numerous third-parties (C++ or Java) as a requirement.\n. > fixed see above\nIf you have control over the web-server, may I suggest adding a redirect from the old (wrong) URL to the new one? For the benefit of those still using the unpatched version of SikuliX?\n. Is the current test suit already usable -- even if it does not offer full coverage? (If such full coverage is even possible in principle, that is.)\nEven if it provides merely a \"smoke test\" at this time, it is much better than nothing at all. How would I use it?\n. Err, sorry, the second commit is unrelated and was meant for a separate pull-request. Now you may as well review it here, I suppose...\n. > Anything wrong with putting it into the bundle?\nNothing whatsoever. But it needs to be adjusted for the paths inside. Also, as you can see, I use a separately-installed JXGrabKey.jar (and wish, I could refer to other non-Sikili JARs the same way).\n. ",

Tested also with Screen Sharing app by sharing screen locally (so it's different app), but it is the same issue with click(). Mouse is on the right spot, but click doesn't do anything.

Is Sikuli running as root?. Try using os.chdir() to set the current directory before calling the executable.

You could run Sikuli locally, on the VNC server, so that the client's image manipulation doesn't affect the script. As long as the host resolution itself doesn't change, client-side scaling wouldn't have any effect.\nThe other option would be to disable client-side scaling in the VNC client. If the VNC host's resolution is larger than the client's screen, you might have scroll bars, but this could be an option depending how much of the screen you need to access.. Looks like you have an extra space before wait(10). Is that just a copy-paste issue?. Does this work?\nApp('\"C:/Program Files (x86)/Cisco/Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client/vpnui.exe\"').

What could be the possible solutions?\nThanks and Regards,\nPrinci Verma\n.
