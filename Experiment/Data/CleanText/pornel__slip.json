It does seem hide the error rather than fix the root cause. If there's no target, then the library shouldn't be in state of dragging a target.\n. Sorry for late response.\n- Instead of detecting prefix by checking for ActiveXObject you can detect it by checking for the prefix, like it's done for WebKit.\n- I'm not sure if it's worth supporting IE, given that the library is meant for mobile, and doesn't support IE's PointerEvents.\n. There's no option for it out of the box. If you swap x/y width/height in the source it might work.\n. Try user-select:none. Thanks for sharing your solutions.\n. Yeah, sorry. It's likely an iOS issue.\n. This is a very bad idea \u2014 it will disable hardware acceleration (when too many elements are layers browsers give up and fall back to CPU rendering).\n. Add event listener for slip:beforeswipe event and call preventDefault()\n. Done 94f48f954ed9c5a29b41e5f882e63a9cbc7e1f6a\n. This was implemented in #12. If it's not complete, then it'd be great if you could fix it :)\n. This line is supposed to animate move of the element back to its original position.\n. when you reorder, call preventDefault to prevent that animation.\n. Cool! Thanks.\n. No. I hope it's simple enough that somebody else can wrap/adapt it if necessary.\n. Sorry, I don't have Windows, so I won't do it. See #2 \n. OK, I've created a tag\n. That's because IE9 and IE10 are not supported at all. IE11 only on mobile, but I haven't tested it. Please don't use this library if you need IE support.\n. Is there a solution that does not involve detecting a particular browser? Is that a timing issue? Can it be solved by setting a flag or deferring actions with setTimeout? \n. Listening for selection change event (and preventDefault on it) is to prevent mouse movement during reordering from being interpreted as text selection gesture. Without it drag may still work, but browsers will be selecting all text along the way, which is ugly and confusing.\nThe second problem is that on iOS you can't prevent selection this way (you can with CSS only), but you can at least react to it happening, so Slip tries to cooperate with iOS in that case, and aborts the drag.\nDoes this line run in your case? (i.e. if you delete that line, does it work for you?) https://github.com/pornel/slip/blob/4fa9d23063e5b88e31850ae57dc5303daa48ba65/slip.js#L583\nif so, it'd be better to add browser sniffing to this condition https://github.com/pornel/slip/blob/master/slip.js#L577\n. >  Do you have a reliable way to detect iOS?\nNo, unfortunately. Test for iPhone|iPad|iPod and not Android|Windows (to eliminate some everything-goes user-agents).\n. Thanks\n. Setting willChange informs the browser that the element will animate soon, so it should be using an accelerated layer. Without it you would have a delay/jerky animation when it starts moving.\nSetting transformProperty to an empty string like that would completely break all animations in all browsers that don't emulate WebKit.\n. the names of variables are not clear though, transformPrefix should be JSTransformPropertyName and transformProperty should be CSSTransformPropertyName.\n. Firefox has unprefixed transform in 2012 in v16. I don't think there's a need to support versions that old.\n. That's weird. I've checked, and FF (v47) emulates webkit properties, so the unprefixed empty-string transformProperty is not even used. \nI've switched the logic around to prefer unprefixed now. \nPerhaps willChange exposes a browser bug. Promoting element to a layer could mess with z-index. However, checkboxes and select elements work on my demo page, so I can't reproduce the problem you're reporting. \n. Sorry, I don't understand. Are you saying you're using something like <span onclick> instead of <input type=checkbox>?\n. In that case, try disabling swipe-drag on the span:\nol.addEventListener('slip:beforeswipe', function(e){\n// change that to detect your <span>\n        if (e.target.nodeName == 'INPUT' || /demo-no-swipe/.test(e.target.className)) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n        }\n    }, false);\n. preventDefault is for the custom event, not the click.\nYou may also want to prevent slip:beforereorder to stop span from being used for dragging up/down.\n. If I remember correctly I was assuming that insertBefore(\u2026, null) is the same as appendChild(\u2026)\n. That's great. Thank you.\n. Makes sense. Thanks.\n. OK, let's try that.\nWhat do other libraries, like jQuery, do in such case?\n. Thank you very much. This is quite solid work!\n. Thank you. That's very useful indeed.\n. You're taking better care of this library than I do, so I've added you to project collaborators :)\n. OK\n. There's a detach method. Alternatively, you could use preventDefault() on slip's events to prevent it from taking actions.\n. LGTM\n. I agree, it is problematic. It probably should keep updating continuously. Updating on mousemove makes scrolling dependent also on the rate browser sends updates, so it can't be relied upon.\nCurrently there's no solution for this proposed.\n. I don't understand what do you mean.. I'm assuming your items are originally stored in some array.\njs\nvar originalIndex = event.detail.originalIndex;\nvar spliceIndex = event.detail.spliceIndex\nvar movedItem = yourArray[originalIndex];\nyourArray.splice(originalIndex, 1); // Remove item from the previous position\nyourArray.splice(spliceIndex, 0, movedItem); // Insert item in the new position. substitute it for the array you use to store the items you're reordering.. This library doesn't work the way you think. It doesn't manage any data at all. You use it to display your data. You're supposed to have the data in the first place.. The library does not hold the data. There is no data in slip. The example I've shown you was for your array of your data, that is never given to or taken from the library.. Yes, a fix is welcome.. contains doesn't return -1, so the >= 0 check is inappropriate. Thank you. I've used array notation deliberately as it's a hint for the Closure Compiler to preserve the global name.. There's no function for this. You could try to copy code of reorder state's onEnd().. I can't reproduce it.\nWhich version of Firefox? Do you get a JS error in the console?. This is because you have <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\". You should never use this for anything, ever.. will-change is needed, and it doesn't throw JS errors, so I don't want to remove it.\nThat might be a Firefox CSS bug. Removing position: absolute; from .fli .btn-icon .pri fixes the issue for me. Try using flexbox instead maybe?\n. You need to figure out CSS layout for this on your own. This library doesn't have any support for columns or anything like that.. You can prevent some elements from being moved by calling preventDefault() on all operations (see how the example page does it).\nThe library doesn't have a concept of empty space between elements, so if an element is removed, it has no choice but move other elements to fill the gap.. Ah, I see. That makes sense.\nThere's reordering state:\nhttps://github.com/pornel/slip/blob/master/slip.js#L371\nand other elements are visually moved here:\nhttps://github.com/pornel/slip/blob/master/slip.js#L416\nand final order is decided here:\nhttps://github.com/pornel/slip/blob/master/slip.js#L468\nSo in these places you'd have to figure out how to skip fixed-position elements.. The change seems simple enough. I'd recommend keeping elements movable by default (with no class) and using class only to make them unmovable.\nPerhaps the class could be slip-fixed-header or slip-fixed-edge, so that it's clear it won't work in the middle..

FWIW, jQuery UI implements this via a css selector that you pass as an option to the constructor.\nOne of the trickiest part is that slip takes the position and size of the moving node into consideration to position sibling nodes while reordering\u2026 but in a cross list reorder, the target list doesn't have that original node space, so it has to be created in some other way.\n. > (for example reordering within a single list should keep behavior of \"locking\" element horizontally and only moving vertically).\nI used a treshold of 20 (I think) pixels before unlocking the horizontal movement, so the behavior is still the same with a single list.\n\nCan you describe your use-cases in more detail?\n\nIn my case it was clearly connecting 2 Slip instances together \u2014 the moved node is dropped into another list at a certain position, not into a generic dropping area.\n.
