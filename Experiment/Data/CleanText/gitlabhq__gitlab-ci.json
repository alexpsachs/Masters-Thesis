Reasons why this was declined for community: \nTravis.yml file\nWe are moving in different direction than Travis. We have difference in architecture that we find simpler.  \nRunner: clone repo, run tests & send output to coordinator\nCoordinator: get output from runners and show it to user.\nThats why all build scripts should be configured via UI. Its more user friendly and matches current architecture when coordinator does not know anything about repository. \nRunners changes\nWe should not change runner code until we have a really good reason. No need to add any complexity in runner code. It should be simple lib that run process and submit output via API.\n. Thank you\n. @williamherry can you please update CHANGELOG too?\n. Sorry but we dont support sqlite: \n\nSQLite shouldn't be used in production (because of mulit-user/multi-process access to DB)\nStrange race conditions with SQL\nProblems with locking\n\nSee discussion for GitLab - https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/2093\n. Old one is expected behaviour. So this looks like a feature/improvement. It makes sense for me if your project requires super-specific ENV so you cant allow other runners to serve your build. So feature looks reasonable. \nBut If we want to change behaviour in this way we need next: \n- CHANGELOG entry\n- Place in UI where I can see that my project wont be served by shared runners\n- Runner UI should say that specific runners lock project from shared runners\n- tests for your change\n. We introduced specific runners so people can add own laptop/server/vps as runner for own projects only. Ex. I used this to extend build capacity for my fork in one instance. But advantages of specific runners are there to limit where projects can be run are bigger. Still this can be a breaking change for someone. So it should be properly described in UI and has CHANGELOG item\n. @ayufan I left some feedback. Also fix houndci comment please\n. @ayufan thank you\n. @vsizov can you review this please?\n.

So it cant be Build duration because single build can take 20-30% of total all builds in one commit\n. I have feeling Cumulative build duration will be even more confusing. Maybe something like Summary builds duration or Builds duration?\n. @nejctrdin we removed Jobs in 7.12.0.pre :)  Maybe Builds duration will be a good choice so far\n. thank you\n.

I'm also thinking about introducing jobs which will take part of builds role. Job will identify one build variant which will be sent to runner. Build take a role to group all jobs for specific commit. However, this is a big change, so I will have to wait for while. We can later think about chaining jobs: waiting before some of the jobs finish.\n. @robodude666 I made it yesterday. However, it's not top notch.

We may do it even better by using current build scripts, but by extending runner to use docker environment (or any environment at all).\n. @yarikdot maybe it would be nice to also specify ref for which project should be built?\n. Wouldn't it be better to have VOLUME directive for sqlite DB and Logs in Dockerfile?\n. Great :)\nOne note there is some guy out there which did docker image for GitLab (https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab). He also has one for GitLab CI (https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci) maybe you could add sqlite support for his image?\n. It's easily get blocked with any insert on larger databases. I agree that is unusable in production environment, but maybe it would be wise to have it as option during :development?\n. Ok\n. It seems reasonable.\n. I thought that specific runners are there to limit where projects can be run. I would expect project to run only on selected runner. It maybe useful in cases where server can deploy application to production servers.\nMaybe we can even extend it to support specific runners per-branch basis. For example master is always executed on the selected one. I think that I saw somewhere PR for that.\n. @randx it's updated.

I think that it's better to have WebHook URL configured on per-project basis. Different teams use different projects and want to have notifications to their's channels. Also it will generate separate notifications for each build executed in parallel. For me it would be better to get summary of all builds instead of each one separately. It reduces noise.\n. Thats why in our fork our Slack summary message contains only information about failed ones as attachments. It looks pretty nice. If all jobs succeeded you will get only one line short notice message.\n. I'm not entirely convinced about grouping of notify_all_broken_builds. You may want one channel to be more verbose than the other.\n. It's part of bigger change and it needs to be reworked before it can be send. There are my proposals: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/issues/63\nIt's good time to think how it should behave and how we can enhance it.\n. @robodude666 we are looking into best possible way to implement this feature, will keep you update when we decide about the way it will be implemented\n. This needs to be updated.\n. Please check this: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/pull/462 as it includes all changes that later I will split into smaller chunks of code.\n. @Wachiwi it's agreed with @dosire to push this as one large change for now, we will later work on splitting PR into chunks\n. I'm also thinking about introducing jobs which will take part of builds role. Job will identify one build variant which will be sent to runner. Build take a role to group all jobs for specific commit. However, this is a big change, so I will have to wait for while. We can later think about chaining jobs: waiting before some of the jobs finish.\n. @robodude666 I made it yesterday. However, it's not top notch. I think that ansi2html should be rewritten to javascript. https://github.com/ayufan/gitlab-ci/commits/topic/build_trace_folding\nTravis-CI License allows it:\nhttps://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/blob/master/LICENSE\nhttps://github.com/travis-ci/travis-yaml/blob/master/LICENSE\n. As you can see there's pretty long list of commits here. This needs to be split into smaller PR.\n. I agree with you. We may do it even better by using current build scripts, but by extending runner to use docker environment (or any environment at all).\n. @yarikdot maybe it would be nice to also specify ref for which project should be built?\n. Wouldn't it be better to have VOLUME directive for sqlite DB and Logs in Dockerfile?\n. Great :)\nOne note there is some guy out there which did docker image for GitLab (https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab). He also has one for GitLab CI (https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci) maybe you could add sqlite support for his image?\n. It's easily get blocked with any insert on larger databases. I agree that is unusable in production environment, but maybe it would be wise to have it as option during :development?\n. Ok\n. It seems reasonable.\n. I thought that specific runners are there to limit where projects can be run. I would expect project to run only on selected runner. It maybe useful in cases where server can deploy application to production servers.\nMaybe we can even extend it to support specific runners per-branch basis. For example master is always executed on the selected one. I think that I saw somewhere PR for that.\n. @randx it's updated. What do you think?\n. @randx I addressed all the comments.\n. @randx @vsizov any update?\n. @dblessing Thanks. Fixed.\n. Fixed once again :)\n. @vsizov updated\n. @vsizov ?\n. Ok. I see it's in right bottom of the screen. Thanks :)\n. @randx I'm working currently on incremental updates of build trace window. Is it worth? \n. @randx What do you think? Should I finish it?\n.
