There is no need to worry about overhauling, it is one of the reasons the Pod is still 0.1.1. I think it is a really good idea as we should be able to mimic the twitter animation exactly.\nI am happy for you to go ahead with either of these approaches. \n. A couple of other features to consider as well:\n- adding a background image/pattern behind\n- not masking the icon\nwhat is your opinion here?\n. I am also going to have a look at creating some new unique transition styles the user can then select from. \n. This looks good to me, although I imagine the iconColor is also not working either now as it is only assigned in the init method as well. Ill have a look and if all good will merge this and update. \nthank aldrincb\n. Yep good spot akiroom, ill merge this in, thanks\n. Ill update this asap, although I will be quite busy until this evening (GMT) thanks\n. Thanks for raising this, something that slipped under the radar. will get this patched asap,\nthank you\n. thanks for your implementation rvirin, ill review your changes later and let you know.\nit's a good idea to allow the user to change the size of the scaling.. \n. awesome thanks for this, i will sort this out when i get some time.\n. Hi Alex, I think the cocoapod is currently not the latest.. I do mean to update this but I haven't had the time recently, the files in the Classes/ directory are up to date.. you could create a PR that would be great, but if not, ill try and update this soon. cheers\n. Sorry have been away guys, also very busy at work atm.. thank you very much for doing that @Mazyod . I think it should be fine. \n.

    "Mazyod": "So, the first issue I came across is: How to handle the current implementation?\nI think the current implementation is useful by itself, and could be used, so I won't be replacing it. I am, however, seeing two possible approaches:\n1) Add a new init method that takes a UIBezierPath, and save the bezier path.\nThe issue here is, everywhere in the code, we have to add if statements. Check if we are using the bezier path, then do this, otherwise do nothing. Same thing for the image.\nHere is an example:\n``` objc\n- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n  / Only override draw rect for vectorized splash screen /\n  if (!self.bezierPath) {\n    return [super drawRect:rect];\n  }\nCGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n  CGContextAddRect(context, self.bounds);\n  CGContextAddPath(context, self.bezierPath.CGPath);\n[self.backgroundViewColor setFill];\n  CGContextEOFillPath(context);\n}\n```\n2) Provide an abstract superclass interface, and have different implementations in two subclasses.\nI think this is a better approach, since it modularly separates the two functionalities. We should also hide those classes from the user, and provide a convenient \"factory\" method, since the user doesn't need to worry about the exact subclass he is using.\nFrom this, I realized there will be some major overhauls to the component, but it will be hidden within the component.\nMaz\n. I love the transitions idea! Maybe you can create a new issue for each feature/bug?\n. Thanks for the PR. Yup, totally missed that issue. The vector counterpart needs the same fix, but we can create a separate issue for that.\nWill wait for @callumboddy to review this.\n. Arigato gozaimasu, kansha shimasu :)\nYeah, I think @callumboddy can merge this one :+1: \n. Related to #15, you may want to follow that PR instead.\n. Hey guys, I'm late to the party as usual, but I have some time on my hands now. I'll try to update the cocoapods today if that works for you\n. in case you are interested, he is alive and well :) You may not be reaching him, or he's probably just too busy to look into this repo for the time being https://twitter.com/callumboddy/status/606405392873193473\n. @pjebs As it says, I am a collaborator on this repo, callumboddy agreed to add me when I contributed the bezier path approach.\n. Well, I tried to make a new cocoapods release, just to be safe, but that didn't work because apparently I don't have permissions to make a new cocoapods release. I updated the 1.0.0 tag reference, but that is sub optimal, because some cache may exist somewhere, and also might break stuff for existing users of the 1.0.0 version...\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. Anytime @callumboddy~! I'll try to help out, feel free to assign me to stuff if you find an urgent issue.\n@pjebs Yes, I created it, then removed it since I didn't have permission to bump the project version.
