This is a problem mentioned in issue #72 \n. @ajans I have tried this, it did fix the problem when you press the back button, but when you activate/populate the search box, and then press the back-arrow button, the problem would happen again.\nI think the best solution now is to actually create separate classes for each type of the search boxes, one for reveal-from-button, one for persistent. Are you going to work on this? Cuz I won't be able to start until all my finals end.\n. Hi, I've posted in the issued mentioned (#88).\n. Hi, sorry for taking so long, the bug goes like this:\nClick on the edit text area while the search results are not shown, then click on the arrow to hide/fold the results, there will be a double collapsing.\n. Sorry, that didn't help\n. This seems a lot like change made in #76, I'll check again\n. ",

I don't think it would be elegant or necessary to create a separate class for the extra use case as that would likely introduce a ton of duplicated code (which is hard to maintain and error prone).\n.
