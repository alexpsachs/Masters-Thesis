If you look above it says\n-   [node.JS]: http://nodejs.org\n-     [Redis-server]: http://redis.io\nThose are the two tools being referred to.\n. I'm working on the fix for avatars.\nAs for the other part of this issue, it looks like a connect-auth issue. Not a Balloons.IO issue.\n. Would 127.0.0.1 work instead?\n. A quick Google suggests that 127.0.0.1 is a workaround to localhost not being accepted by Twitter. Haven't been able to test though.\nThe reason why I'm avoiding leaving it as local.host is because I think it's an error, then other people might too.\n. @cristiandouce any input?\n. I don't think this is related to Redis?\nAnyway, I will install Fedora this afternoon so I should be able to test.\n. I have Added my Cert and Key into the config and i get this error: \nurl.js:110\n    throw new TypeError(\"Parameter 'url' must be a string, not \" + typeof url)\n          ^\nTypeError: Parameter 'url' must be a string, not undefined\n    at Url.parse (url.js:110:11)\n    at Object.urlParse as parse\n    at Config (/root/Balloons.IO/config/index.js:56:25)\n    at Object.

Do you have a version >= 0.5.0 of node?\n. You're welcome\nOn Jun 13, 2012 7:12 PM, \"Jeffrey Lo\" \nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nSorry about the late response, fellows!\nYes, I updated to the latest node.js version and it's working peachy.\nThanks.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/gravityonmars/Balloons.IO/issues/31#issuecomment-6315239\n. I think Heroku free account doesn't allow websockets. We are going to open a demo very soon.\n. We support non-websockets systems because of socket.io but we want to allow the best possible experience.\n. Closed until next version\n. Yep. Private messages are contemplated fro next versions. Tab completion would be cool for \"mentions\" inside messages. \n\nThank you for all the help.\n. Can you explain better the issue? thanks\n. We changed to passportjs, can you update and test it again?\n. http://cl.ly/0Q2u1Q1k1x2T2m3i2f2F\nThis is because we don't refresh the room list when you are inside a room. (in the first tab I don't have room 29 monos)\n. We can use socket.io to autoupdate the list...\n. It's a problem with the 'easy-oauth' module. They need to replace 'sys' with 'util'. I just asked the owner of the module to fix this (there is a pull request for that https://github.com/robrighter/easy-oauth/pull/3). I suggest to wait a couple of days :)\nSorry for the inconvenients.\n. easy-oauth owner is going to change his module this weekend, then I can update our project.\n. Fixed in easy-oauth. I updated the package.json, so if you run npm install now it will be ok.\nThank you for the feedback.\n. Yes. Are you sure you have the right keys for twitter?\nAt the same time I'm noticing that connect 2 only works with node < 0.7.x\nI really want Balloons.IO to work with node 0.8 so I'm going to updgrade the whole library. \nAt the moment, if your keys are right, please back to 0.6 and i'll notice you when we can be compatibles with 0.8. It should be very soon.\n. Changed to passportjs and working with node 0.8.x Please test it :)\n. We are using \"easy-oauth\". It would be very easy to implement for instance facebook. Now using only twitter is very easy to identify nicknames and fetch the pictures.\nWe are not planning to add other services but you are welcome to fork and add others. If we like the changes you introduce, we can merge a pull request.\n. @kylescottmcgill  If you want, take a look at passport.js. Pretty cool stuff.\n. Can you tell us which node.js version are you using?\nthanks\n. We have to rearrange the project to support 0.8.x.\nNow working on that. We will updated this ticket when fixes.\nSorry and thanks.\n. Now working with node 0.8 please test again\n. Not even a smile, a stupid face.\n. Fixed in fbauth branch. Really hoping to merge soon.\n. Also take care of the new avatars. Maybe we can use avatars.io service...\n. @ricardorauch done. Need to review it if we want to add new providers...\n. You need to fill in the file \"config.sample.json\" and rename it to \"config.json\"\n. Why not? Are you using node >= 0.6.0? Since node 0.6 you can require a json module and it automatically parse it.\n. Thanks\n. yes it is. I'll fix it now. Thanks\n. We got back to the redis module version 0.7.2\n. Since we are using passportjs it should be easy to implement other kind of login. Pull requests are welcome :)\n. Almost the same as #80, About the user preferences editing we can build something.\n. I like this, thanks.\nI'd like more to make a lua script that runs inside redis. If I don't have the time in the following days we can still merge this. @cristiandouce what do you think?\n. We can add an option like \nhttps : {\n//credentials\n}\ninto config.json\n. Added the https option via a credentials option in the config.\n\"credentials\": {\n  \"key\": \"yourkey\",\n  \"cert\": \"yourcert\"\n}\n. @gravityonmars I fixed it but can't push. Can you get my permissions back? thanks.\n. you need to run npm install and restart your server.\n. If you are in UNIX you can redirect the stdout and stderr http://www.mathinfo.u-picardie.fr/asch/f/MeCS/courseware/users/help/general/unix/redirection.html\n. thanks!\n. Hi, you can add your login strategy on this file https://github.com/gravityonmars/Balloons.IO/blob/master/strategy.js (on your fork, we have no plans to add this kind of authentication strategy on the official project).\nUsing https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local should be easy.\n. If you are using a web server (like nginx or apache) in front of node.js you can configure it to do the work. Otherwise you can create an http server (not https) and redirect all traffic to the https server.\nI found this question that can be useful for you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7450940/automatic-https-connection-redirect-with-node-js-express\n. @Tyvain Did you create a facebook app for this? And if you did, using that Callback URL?\n. @Tyvain It seems the request was stopped by your firewall https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6820\n. Not out of the box but you can add a new anonymous login strategy and will do the magic.\n. ",

We are currently working on 'redisRemake' branch.

Will be available in couple of weeks. =)\n. Solved since last update!\n. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/users/profile_image/%3Ascreen_name\n. @danzajdband \nCould you clarify this with an example? I just don't get it.\n. Already online!\n. Have you tried avoiding nginx? (maybe at a localhost installation - with 127.0.0.1 for twitter app)\nAlso, could you share nodejs log?\nIs socket.io being started? (nodejs log would tell...)\n. Thanks! I'll run it myself and merge as soon as I can! Great work! \n. @themgt & @jwietelmann Have you tried and successfully run BalloonsIO with those changes?\nI wasn\u00b4t able to run any... It just doesn\u00b4t work when I merge this changes locally. Could you review this?\n. @themgt With twitter it throws me this: http://d.pr/n/PSlR\nI \"successfully\" connected with facebook login... but on the browser throws me this: http://d.pr/i/kmnS\nI guess websockets are not allowed in pogoapp.\nThe fact is that I ran a merge locally and was not able to connect with twitter. Is there any config option missing on \"config/sample.json\"? @jwietelmann the same with your merge into Balloons.IO/master.\n. @jwietelmann I copied my old \"config.json\" to \"config/development.json\" if that's what you are asking. And that's the point of my question: Is there some \"sample\" config key missing on \"config/sample.json\"? (for local configuration... maybe that wasn't implicit...)\nBut never mind. I cloned your repo and made it work, which leads me to worry about why doesn't it work when I perform a merge with current master branch. Will check out soon.\n. Thanks!\n. I believe that is a question for elephant.io. How are you using this with Balloons.IO?\n. The original idea of Balloons.IO was to login with facebook or twitter. Don't see it changing in a while.\n. We do .join and .leave. But also we keep track of every user by an internal id and try to handle this issue.\n@laffster Could you give detailed picture of your particular issue? \n. @sncer is right. It's a WIP. Closing for now.\n. @Hexatise you have something wrong with your configs.\nConfig parser is missing redisUrl at line 56 of config/index.js according to the log you shared.\n. @imnpandey @nik0202 \nPlease check in case I'm wrong, but I think github urls like component/type are supported from npm@1.1.64.\nAnd there was a fix at npm@1.2.20.\nWould you mind check which version you have?\nI'll update the engines path at package.json as soon as you can confirm that this solves the issue.\nThanks!\n. @imnpandey Ok, that's odd! :facepunch: \nI will try it myself. Thanks for the information!\n. We are not fetching that module from npmjs.org but from github instead.\nThat's the reason of the odd sintax. It's how npm fetches from github.\nSince the npmjs.org version of component-type is not up to date, we were force to fetch it from github.\nI'm having no troubles with node@0.10.2 and npm@1.2.15\nSo far, this error seems to appear randomly.\n. @odsail Which node and npm version do you have?\nHave you tried deleting node_modules folder and try again?\nIf that doesn't work, try:\nnpm install --save component-type@component/type\nAnd run again.\n. @kerberoS Thanks! :+1: \n. So... for what I'm seeing seems to be an error with jQuery. Odd.\nA little more about the log would be awesome!\nQ: do you have access to IE9 or IE10, in order to have a \"console\" tab that logs javascript ouptputs and errors? Any of those can be set to Browser mode: IE8 and still have IE9 and IE10 tools that could help us debugging this.\nThanks!\n. Awesome!\nI'd try first updating some of the libs used. jQuery@1.7.1 is way out of date. Also ICanHaz, but starting with jQuery should throw different, IMO.\nThanks!\n. :+1: \n. bash\n$ npm install component-type@component/type\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/component-type\nnpm http 404 https://registry.npmjs.org/component-type\ncomponent-type@1.0.0 node_modules/component-type\n$ npm version\n  node: '0.10.21',\n  npm: '1.3.11'\nAre you having trouble installing this module for Balloos.IO?\nCan you be more descriptive at the troubleshoot?\n. @scollett It's cool!\nThanks!\n.
