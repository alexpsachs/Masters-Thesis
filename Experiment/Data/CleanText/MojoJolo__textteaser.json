    "MojoJolo": "Thanks @cdshines. I also encountered this issue. Will check it out later and merge it.\n. Sorry about the encoding issues. Some clumsy issues right there. Anyways. @cdshines fixed it and I merged it already. Thanks. Will close this issue.\n. Thanks for the improvements you made. Sorry for the delay, I didn't get any notifications from Github via email. Will review this as I said in the other comments and will merge it. :)\n. @melpomene is right. @timforgach any updates after installing mongodb? Then input the necessary settings here in the Config.scala file: https://github.com/MojoJolo/textteaser/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/textteaser/summarizer/Config.scala\n. I think this is an issue in authentication. I removed the database authentication so username and password is not required now.\n. I just saw this now. Sorry for the delay. Will review this later and will merge it. Thanks! :)\n. The corpus files are used by OpenNLP to split sentences. You can see corpus for other languages here: http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/\nAnd if you want to create a model for yourself, here's the instructions from OpenNLP: http://opennlp.apache.org/documentation/1.5.3/manual/opennlp.html#tools.sentdetect.training\n. @jasons-novaleaf NLP experience is not required. :) You can contribute by gathering articles of the language you choose. Split those articles into sentences via new line. It can then be used as a corpus. The instruction into building a corpus is easy, just follow the link I posted above.\n. Yes. This will be the next issue I planned to open. I don't have that experience with testing but I think I tried ScalaTest.\n. I saw it. Didn't manage to reply though. Sorry about it.\nI'm aware that the results might be different with those two implementations.\nI first implemented the commented code for the algorithm. It's not in Scala as you see. When I'm implementing it to Scala, I saw some errors in the code. I corrected it in Scala but didn't manage to change it from the commented code. That's why there is some inconsistency.\nFor added reference, here's the formula I used for DBS: http://imgur.com/8ZjKPbK. You might want to take a look at it. There might still wrong implementation in the code.\nBy the way, you're awesome and will review your pull request tomorrow.\n. Here:\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.222.6530&rep=rep1&type=pdf\nAs you can see in 4.3 which is in page 3, the paper mentioned two algorithms for sentence selection. These are Summation-Based Selection and Density-Based Selection. Which is SBS and DBS respectively.\n. The code here in Github only accepts the text and the title. The API in Mashape has another layer to extract the text from the webpage. It was using Python Goose for it.\n. Yes. Those are the numbers I obtain in my research.\n. TextTeaser.com is running continuously and all the articles it summarized are saved in the database. Previous articles are used to determine the keywords and might affect the result.\n. Didn't manage to check it right now. Sorry about it. @cdshines. I just saw your pull request. Weird because Github never alerts me.\n. I'm sorry that merging took a while.\n. I created a news reader for Philippine news called Readborg (http://ph.readborg.com/). The word Philippines and Manila will appears very frequently that I just decided to just add them to the stop words. Never managed to remove it though.\n. Can you replaced this line (https://github.com/MojoJolo/textteaser/blob/master/project/plugins.sbt#L7) with this:\naddSbtPlugin(\"com.github.mpeltonen\" % \"sbt-idea\" % \"1.6.0\")\nI think the previous dependency doesn't exist anymore thus needs to be replaced. If it works, can you pull request your changes and I'll merge it.\n. ",
