    "ryanxcharles": "Awesome.\n. Awesome, reviewing now.\n. Looks great so far.\n. Why is foundation better than bootstrap?\n. OK cool. So long as the integration with Angular is sufficiently mature, it sounds good to me.\n. Awesome. Reviewing now.\n. Great job. Looks like the making an individual connection works - I'm able to connect to one peer. I guess the next step is to make it so that when I connect to a peer, I also connect to that peer's peers, so that everybody ends up being connected to everybody else.\n. Looks great.\n. Looks nice. I assume you're planning on not using the home icon for every button in a separate pull request soon?\n. Looks good to me.\nCouple of things I notice with the p2p stuff right now:\n- Hitting refresh on the peer pages seems to cause me to lose my connection.\n- If I use browser B to connect to browser A, browser B shows two peers, but browser A still shows only one.\n. @colkito Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Save the IDs locally so you can reconnect on refresh. Because I'm sure people are going to hit \"refresh\" often, like I do, and it will be annoying to be disconnected.\n. Looks awesome.\n. Woops, thanks for noticing that. I didn't notice the tabs vs. spaces this time.\n. Woops there's a conflict - I just merged in @bechi's change a few seconds ago... the conflict is probably there. Can you fix the conflict and then update the PR?\n. Tested. Great work. This upgrades the behavior to this:\n- If B connects to A, A also connects to B.\n- If C connects to A, A also connects to C, and B also connects to C, and C connects to B.\n...which is great, but I still see a problem:\n- If C connects to B, then C does not connect to A, and A does not connect to C.\nSo this is an update over the previous situation, but it is still not the case that all peers connect to all other peers in every case. Also, somehow we need to come up with a unique ID for the wallet that is different than the IDs for the peers.\n. Great.\n. Awesome. Looks good to me. Some comments:\n- \"Signout\" doesn't seem to clear the list of peers. There should be a way to clear local storage and not necessarily reconnect to the same peers.\n- The count of how many copayers there were seemed to be inaccurate if I connect and disconnect a few times. Right now one of my browsers says \"6/5\" copayers.\n- We should consider encrypting everything in local storage for security sake (or maybe not - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17280390/can-local-storage-ever-be-considered-secure )\n- We will also be using local storage for the wallet, so we may want to come up with a good general interface for local storage.\n- Along those lines, we will also want a command-line tool that does the same things old cosign did, and this will involve saving files to disk. Probably the file storage interface here could have some overlap with the HTML local storage.\n. A few more comments after playing with it some more:\n- If I click \"sign out\" and then \"create wallet\" again and again, it keeps adding peers even though I am only one peer. When I create a new wallet, there should be no one connected to it.\n- Somehow we need to figure out how to use an ID for the wallet, so that you copy+paste the ID for the wallet and \"connect\" to that, and not one of the peers.\n. Looks great.\n. Great work. Pulling this in so we can start using it right away, but please see the comments I made - especially the one about this.getCopayersPubKeys(index, isChange).\n. Great job. For the record there are still some issues, but I think these may actually be related to Web RTC in Firefox and/or Chrome and have nothing to do with your code. On my phone connection through a VPN, I seem to not be able to connect from Chrome to Firefox, but can connect from Firefox to Chrome.\n. Agreed with @martindale. We should have at least brief descriptions of each PR so that people can understand at a glance what's going on without having to read the source code and test it out.\n. This conflicts with Gustavo's PR that I just merged. Can you fix and update the PR?\n.

Updated with basic integration with Wallet.js and tests and interface improvements.\n. Updated to include @maraoz's suggestions.\n. The best place to ask questions for now is the #bitcore channel on Freenode. We're there every day.\nSince Copay is a brand new project, we're making huge, breaking changes to it every day. At the moment it doesn't make sense to create documentation for it which would rapidly become obsolete. If you're interested in contributing, you can ask questions in #bitcore or look at the issues on Github.\nYou don't necessarily need access to a bitcoind server.

Like sharing public keys for ssh, if you don't already have secure channel to share the public keys, then the connection cannot be regarded as being secure.

Maybe it should have a \"close\" button so that it only disappears after you close it?\n. If we have the option, I prefer \"test.\" to \"test-\", because that is what we already do for \"test.bitpay.com\". i.e., prefix the \"real\" domain with \"test.\"\n. I will eventually do this if no one else does. If someone else wants to beat me to it, I can give you the bitpay.com source code which already has the merchant side of the code implemented. You could use it as a reference to write the core payment protocol code for bitcore, which would then be used by copay.\n.

A is connect to B, and B to C, but A is not connected to C, then C cannot receive updated meta data from A or vice versa. e.g., if A wants to reject a tx proposal, that will not be seen by C.\nAnother way to solve this is for the peers to relay messages from other peers, but each message should be cryptographically signed by the author of that message. That way peers cannot fake messages from other peers. In order to prevent replay attacks, each message should have a nonce that is incremented with each new message.\nAnyway, we can worry about that next. I'm working on the signing code right now.\nACK.

All the tests pass.\nI created a test page to test the URI handling, and it did indeed handle the fact that I clicked the bitcoin: URI by opening up a new copay tab. I tried to log in to my 1-of-1 test wallet, but then I got a PeerJS error. Should this have worked? It seems there is a problem somewhere with 1-of-1 wallets, since PeerJS should have nothing to do with those. That probably has nothing to do with this PR, though.\n. That was in Firefox, I tried the same thing in Chrome, this time with a 2-of-2 wallet. Again, it did handle the bitcoin: URI click, and then it asked me to login. I got a PeerJS error. I figured that was probably because I still had my other tab open, so I closed that tab and clicked the linked again. After one more PeerJS error, I tried again, and got in this time. Nothing happened with the bitcoin: URI. I clicked the \"send\" page and did not see any values filled in.\n. Now that I know I can't have the wallet open when I click the link, I tried again, and this time it worked. I don't mean to block progress on this issue, but IMO it is not very useful in this form. Perhaps we can pull this in, since it does actually work and all the tests pass, but we can't advertise that \"copay handles bitcoin: URIs\" until they can open in an existing tab.\nAlso, it would be valuable to be able to copy+paste a bitcoin: URI into the send form. Bitcoin-QT allows this and it is the primary way I pay with bitcoin when a bitcoin URI is available. I don't rely on clicking the link - only copy+pasting.\n. It's useful because the event catching thing is often problematic, like we see here. And copy+pasting a single bitcoin URI is easier than copy+pasting both the address and the amount (which doesn't even work by default in Copay, since we default to bits). Also, once we have payment protocol, you pretty much have to be able to copy+paste the bitcoin: URI anytime handling it doesn't work, otherwise you can't pay with payment protocol.\n. mocha browser tests fail for me with this because the \"http\" module does not exist. I would recommend stubbing out whatever else from that module you need, since http shouldn't be necessary for running this test anyway.\n. Don't pull this in yet, there might be a problem with the way signatures are being created. I have problems broadcasting transactions.\n. I get errors that look like this in the browser console:\nRaw transaction:  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 copayBundle.js:1966\nPOST https://test-insight.bitpay.com/api/tx/send 400 (Bad Request) copayBundle.js:685\nINSIGHT ERROR: undefined copayBundle.js:675\nBITCOIND txid: undefined\nWhen I try to broadcast the transaction by hand in bitcoin-qt using the sendrawtransaction rpc command, I get a -22 error, which may mean the transaction is invalid for some reason. Maybe the signatures are invalid.\n. Fixed. Info: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/pull/440\n. Is \"sign in\" the same thing as the \"create new wallet\" page? Because I don't think there's going to be anything quite like a normal sign in page... just a way to input the master private key and authenticate.\n. This is fine for now, but we'll probably want to change this to whatever the new convention is before launch, described here:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32148600/\n. IMO, since multisig transactions are always described as \"M of N\", we could shorten this to just M instead of neededCosigners, and N instead of totalCosigners.\n. We might want to consider calling this PublicWallet or Treasure, since \"Wallet\" has a conventional meaning which is very different from a standard wallet.\n. This seems fine to me, but we should remember (I think it was Gustavo who noticed this?) the problem of how Coinpunk exposes its private keys to the console ... we should make sure to use closures properly to hide any private keys or public keys unless they need to be exposed. Of course we will still need the decrypt and encrypt functions you have here... maybe the wallet itself is whats hidden in a closure.\n. Shouldn't this either be getExtendedMasterPrivKey, or allow for an index? e.g., getExtendedMasterPrivKey(i), where i = 0, 1, 2, ... , n. Since there are many private keys. Same thing with the public key below.\nAlso, it seems your idea of a multisig wallet is different than my own ... yours seems to have the private keys contained inside. I presume only one person's master private key in this wallet, and each person has a different version of the wallet, since other people will have their own master private key inside?\n. That seems like a good idea to hedge against the (remote) possibility that there is some kind of crypto problem with BIP 32, but seems like the sort of feature we should add only after we have the minimally viable product available.\nAnother related idea is the ability to sweep funds in case someone's keys are compromised.\n. Seems like you have an index here... that's good, but also the extended public and private keys do also need indexes. In order to build one public key from another, you have to have the chain code, which is in the extended public key, but not the regular public key.\n. I don't see any sorting here ... we need to use the same sorting method I used in Treasure:\nhttps://github.com/ryanxcharles/treasure/blob/master/treasure.js\n. We should probably break this function up into getAddress, getPubKeys, getSortedPubkeys, and getRedeemScript, like I did in Treasure. That makes it easier to test and makes for more readable code.\n. OK, that's fine.\n. I tried communicating with people to figure out what the standard method was. As best I can tell this is the standard. I just forwarded some correspondence I shared with Alan Reiner of Armory and my email to the bitcoin-development mailing list.\n. The sorting is most important when generating the p2sh address. The obvious thing to do to me is to sort the public keys for every new address. That way, when given the same set of public keys, the same p2sh address is always generated. Using the sort order of the original extended public keys would not allow one to find the correct address from just the public keys for that address.\n. Users of the wallet need to have access to the chain code at every step. The chain code is necessary for deriving further extended public keys (and regular public keys).\n. Your tabs are a different size than what's already in main.css. I say we stick with 2 spaces for tabs in css files to keep things consistent.\n. \"This follows the Electrum convention, as described in\"\n. \"We should probably adopt the next standard once it's ready, as discussed in:\"\n. generateNonce is not cryptographically secure since it relies on Math.random, which is not sufficiently random. We should be using crypto.randomBytes. Or better yet, we should implement our own cross-platform method that uses all the best randomization on node, the browser (with special cases for every browser), and WinJS.\n. I've added an issue for this: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/issues/211\n. Shouldn't this be this.getCopayersPubKeys(index, isChange) ?\n. If this function doesn't have any parameters, then where is index defined? In a line that follows:\nvar path = (isChange ? CHANGE_BRANCH : PUBLIC_BRANCH) + index;\nSeems to me a function named \"getCopayersPubKeys\" should be clear about which index it is for which we intend to get the public keys. Maybe it should be this.index?\n. Ha, woops. find/replace gone wrong.\n. Does this also work in node? Note that bitcore already has sha512 hmac - maybe we can use that instead of including another dependency?\n. I think should actually be 0x80000000 - 1, not 0x8000000 - 1; (you need to add one more zero ... there are only 7 digits in yours, but there should be 8). This number should be equal to the maximum value for a non-hardened index, which is 2^31 - 1;\nvar MAX_NON_HARDENED = 0x80000000 - 1;\nor\nvar MAX_NON_HARDENED == Math.pow(2,31) - 1;\nI would probably set it equal to 0x80000000 - 1 and then write a test that ensures that it is equal to Math.pow(2,31) - 1.\n. retworkName? This is what a regression looks like.\n. Must be a merge error. I'll add it back in.\n. Also a merge error. I actually fixed this in one of my commits already.\n. I'm open to that but I don't actually think this require should be moved to a separate file, that would just make things more confusing. Really the correct way to solve it is to figure out how to use the same require('../copay') everywhere, but I couldn't figure out how to make that work in both node and browserify at the same time.\n. Preconditions looks pretty cool... it does a better job of what I was trying to accomplish with the API a couple of months ago. This will be handy for when we actually finish implementing the API.\n. I don't think this is necessarily correct. What if there are many outputs, and the size of the tx is greater than 1kb? Then you need to subtract two of the FEE_PER_1000B_SAT, not just one.\n. This should really be wrapped inside of another describe that says describe('#getNumber', ... If we can keep tests for each function in their on describe, it is easier to see which functions have tests and which don't.\n. Agreed.\n. It's going to be a little annoying to test for development if we default to livenet. What happened to the config.default.js? The point of that file was so that you could keep your own local config.js file that was .gitignored and so you wouldn't constantly be bothered with whether you wanted to commit your local config to the repo.\n. IMO, this type of logic needs to be in Copay core, not a controller. Putting this in a controller is going to make it painful to incude this in the future API.\n. The API should be able to process a bitcoin URI. It won't \"handle\" it the way a web app might receive an event that such a URI has been clicked, but you give it a bitcoin URI and it will ask you to sign a transaction to that address of that amount, and, if the bitcoin URI is a BIP70 URI, it retrieves the request.\n. The code for splitting a URI into address and amount should be in Copay core, not in a controller.\n. ",

I didn't find any problem to work with angular.\n. About your points:\n- Yes, it 's a problem with angularjs. When you refresh, the connection close (peerjs). But i think that you never need to refresh, it will do automatically.\n- @colkito fixed that problem. I didn't touch that file for avoid conflict.\n. No problem. It was a mistake of @bechi. I didn't see that difference on my Vim. thanks for correcting\n. um... there are some tabs instead spaces in that file. @bechi didn't have well configure his editor. no problem, we will fix that in the next PR by @colkito\n. I investigate about use bower for socket.io, but it works as server-side request, instead including a static file. I didn't find a different solution yet.\n. It happen only one time, when you enter to menu address several times. Then, never again.\nAnyway it is a warning but it doesn't prevent creating more addresses.\n.

It is because the \"Available to Spend\" value wasn't updated. The conditional only check that $rootScope variable:\nif ($rootScope.availableBalance <= form.amount.$modelValue) {\n  $rootScope.flashMessage = { message: 'You have not enough amount to send', type: 'error'};\n  return;\n}\nThat 's all. I think It doesn't work because we are not refreshing the $rootScope variable.\nWith 2) I am agree. I tried to do this disappear then a couple of seconds, but I couldn't. It will take me more time.\n. It is because the \"Available to Spend\" value wasn't updated.

Yes it is a formatting issue of \"number\" Angularjs filter. If it changes to \"number:4\" it show correctly, but always has 4 decimals (whether zero).\n. Related #934\n. Closes #959 \n. Yes, it could be confusing, but it only a filter, we can use it anywhere. With or without decimal fixed. \nAnyway, If we remove the decimal fixed, it shows rounded numbers in some cases like '0.04' (the correct number was '0.0367').\nI will rebase this. \nPlease, review it with different units and let me know if remove the fixed decimal or not. Maybe could be setting if config has only BTC as unit.\n. Updated. \nNow the param of \"noFractionNumber\" filter is optional. This value depends of the unit in config file. Also you can pass a custom number. \nAlso, removed the \"toFixed\" function from controllerUtils used for totalBalance and availableBalance, and replaced for \"noFractionNumber:8\" in html file.\n. IMO if you find an error (text/wording) related with your current work, you should fix it. \nI think this issue isn't necessary to maintain opened.\n. Already fixed.

I am reviewing it again.\n. JJ I found one UI issue. See the screenshot (maybe it appeared with rebase.):\n\n. I have a question: I sent a transactions proposal, but the other copayer did not receive this (in a 2-2 wallet). Is it normal in this type of payment? Or Is it a bug?\n. I was reviewing your angular issues, and I have some tips:\njavascript\nvar address = angular.element(document.querySelector('input#address'));\nThis is the same that\njavascript\nvar address = elem;\nIt is the only way to access to an outside element (amount) from the current element (address).\njavascript\nvar amount = angular.element(document.querySelector('input#amount'));\nBut, you could use scope variable in angular to change modelValue, e.g.\njavascript\nvar amount = scope.sendForm.amount;\nAfter that, you could set and view the current value and validate field.\njavascript\namount.$setViewValue(total); // set total value to model amount\namount.$isValid = true; // set field to valid.\naddress.$modelValue; // return value\naddress.$viewValue; // same above.\nI did some test with this changes and everything seem to work. \nAnyway, I think the only problem with this code is that it is not an elegant solution, but it is valid.

Sorry, we are having problems with insight-testnet, the messages are growing up too fast, so the service is currently offline. We are trying to solve this problem as soon as possible. This issue only affects TESTNET. So you can't join or receive any transaction proposals. \n. insight-testnet is up and running.\nThanks!\n. insight-testnet is up and running.\nThanks!\n. Hi, this error seems to be a problem with the internet connection at the moment to send the transaction to the blockchain. We 'll add a button to re-send the transaction soon #2332.\nThinking little more about the problem, I can see you created the proposal 2 months ago (maybe you already spent the outputs). Anyway, you can try to \"purge\" the pending transaction proposals from all 5 users and create it again. This option is for advanced users (go to Settings -> Show advanced options -> purge) and should do all the users at the same time.\n. Hi @marvin8, I 'm glad to hear you like Copay! I think we will implement this functionality as soon as possible, but we are discussing some details (#2342). I will let you know when we do it.\nThanks!\n. Hi @marvin8, I 'm glad to hear you like Copay! I think we will implement this functionality as soon as possible, but we are discussing some details (#2342). I will let you know when we do it.\nThanks!\n. I know. The idea is to avoid rendering the whole page if you are just browsing your wallet. After click in the button display the QR code or enable the option to input the amount to receive inside the QR code using BIP-21\n. Agree, I don't like to do extra click, but I 'm just thinking in performance improvements for mobile (less elements, best performance at startup). Anyway it 's an idea, all feedback are welcome. We will not implement any issues labeled as \"Idea\".\n. test-insight is currently working well. Days ago we had problem with memory consumption, so we disabled a plugin that handles messages between copayers. \nBy the way, keep in mind that you can have your own insight server in your network (https://github.com/bitpay/insight).\n. LGTM\n. ack. all test passed.\n. I think you were trying to import a local profile using the default configuration (remote store in the cloud). I mean, if you uninstall Copay and install it again, the default configuration uses insight storage (remote). \nSo if you want to import your local profile, you need to change the configuration to use localStorage instead insightStorage\nSettings -> \n     1-.In the cloud \n     2-.In this device\nIf you create the profile \"ON THIS DEVICE\", Copay will use local storage. Check if you see this message bellow the SIGN IN button: \"* Using this device storage. Change to cloud storage on 'settings'.\" \nWell, I think this is the reason that you could import the profile after create a new local profile.\n. Good idea.

You should enter to your profile and -> \"Add wallet\" -> \"Import\".\n. I had the same issue. To reproduce the problem easily I followed this steps (2-2 wallet):\n- Comment line before to send the transaction (It returns 404 error from insight). We verify that the tx was already sent, checking the existence on the blockchain (line 1650 js/models/Wallet.js).\njavascript\nthis.blockchain.broadcast(txHex, function(err, txid) {});\n- Create transaction proposal.\n- Sign the txp.\n- Error\n- Signout, uncomment the lines above.\n- In both copayers you should see the transaction proposal. \n- Broadcast the transaction.\n- Transaction was send to the blockchain and disappear from list of pending for the current copayer.\n  - The other copayer has the transaction with all signatures but without the sentTs. As if it had never sent.\nThe only solution to remove this orphan transactions proposal is to purge them (from settings-> advanced-> purge).\n. ACK, all tests passed. \nManual test with complicated wallets 2-3 and 2-2 OK\n. ACK\n. LGTM. Tested with wp8.1, iphone4s and 6plus.\n. Needs rebase.\n. Duplicated #2423 \n. It 's not a Copay issue, it depends your Chrome configuration.\n\n. It seems to be a problem with a global variable of AngularJS. If you logging out and back, the variables are reloaded. We will check it.\nThanks! \n. This PR (#2429) should solve the problem.\nThanks for report.\n. Could you give us more details how did you do that? Remember that the creator of the wallet needs to be connected while the other copayers are trying to join.\n. Thank you!\n. Was it a 2-2 wallet? If your signature is the latest required to approve the transaction and you reject it, the proposals will disappear from all copayers.\n. There is no way to reverse this operation. You have to create a new proposal.\n. Hello @Kirvx! \nThat\u2019s OK! You have to Open a new file with Poedit selecting New from POT/PO file from file menu (select es.po), then enter a file name (and save it as po/fr.po) and translate.

Anyway if you want, you can make the changes and send your own  pull request. It would be awesome to see an active community of Copay users!\nThank you!\n. Good solution to have Copay in the majority of languages as posible! \nRegarding your work in the ja.po, note that the new template.pot has less words than old Copay. Only a few words are repeated. Open the ja.po file and Update from template POT file.\nAnyway, we are planning to include the translation again when having all words inside the template.pot (right now, only have the words from the html, not javascript files). This issue is related to enable again the automatic translation of Copay: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/2575\nThanks for your suggestion!\n. closes #2901\n. thanks a lot for the contribution!\n.

Manual test: OK\n. Good catch! :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I see your point, but I think it 's not a bug. I mean, in your example \"Bob\" is the real name of your Wallet. So, if you create an alias for Bob (john, richard, or whatever), always you are going to change the alias for the real wallet called \"Bob\" (not for john, richard or whatever). \nPerhaps we could put both names like the previous screen: Alias for John [Bob]. What do you think?\nRegarding the Copay logo, I think this is an issue on Windows systems.\n. I have installed the chrome app in a Windows virtual machine from the store (v1.0.1) and it works (Copay logo on sidebar). It also happened in previous versions?\n. There was an error in \"Add Wallet\". \"W\" should be in lowercase. That 's the reason it wasn't translated. (fixed on #2811)\nYou can't add string to templates.pot manually, because it will be overwritten by the command \"grunt translate\".\nRegarding this issue (too long strings), I agree that the list is too long for another languages. I think we are repeating \"wallet\" many times.\n. Which phrase?\n. In spanish, google translates that phrase to: \"Asegure bitcoin en sus propios t\u00e9rminos con una, carpeta multisignature abierto desde BitPay\". Completely incoherent\n. There was an error when uploading the zip.sig file. It 's OK now. Please try again and let us know if the problem persist.\nThanks!\n. It works great! Thanks!\n. I have an update of this file on my PR (https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/2846), and I also renamed the PO file to do it fully compatible with our schema. For now, we are using generic translation (I mean, not country specific). Could you update your po file (pt.po) since my PR (#2846) be merged?\nThanks a lot for your contribution!\n. Hi @pmichelazzo, I think this PR is not necessary any more, because on it (#2846) we are already including the option to select PT language. I will close it for that reason. Please, feel free to open another PR with your corrections.\nThanks!\n. I am on it. \nThere is an syntax error in file importLegacy.html. Please, check it and update your PR (or let me send the corrections to your PR).\n[$parse:syntax] Syntax Error: Token '{' invalid key at column 27 of the expression [importLegacy.fromCloud ...\n. This LGTM! Nice job!\n. Why not? This is a standard: BIP-21 (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021)\n. I will check\n. ACK. Manual test: OK!\n. Updated.\n. Hi @saschad, thanks a lot!! We are very pleased to receive this type of contributions to Copay\n. One comment regarding this PR: To standardize the translation process, we use (for now) generic languages (not country specific), for example for french, we use fr instead fr_FR. \nCould you change the file property from de_DE to only de. Also to rename the file de_DE.po to de.po?\nThanks!\n. No problem. LGTM.\n. Awesome regarding 'Create new wallet'. Good catch. Thanks!\nLGTM\n. It is strange, it isn't working on Lumia 630 (WP8.1). I will check it again.

Let me update the readme with more info about this.\n. Great job! \nThe code look good to me, but let me try it manually before merge.\n. Everything is OK, but I think we should try to solve another issue before merge this PR.\nThe issue is related with iso-code we are using in Copay right now and the impossibility to modify the header information inside *.po files. For example, in es.po we have:\n\"Project-Id-Version: Copay\\n\"\n\"POT-Creation-Date: \\n\"\n\"PO-Revision-Date: \\n\"\n\"Last-Translator: \\n\"\n\"Language-Team: \\n\"\n\"Language: es\\n\"\n...\nCrowdin generates a .po file with more headers and the most important with Language value different. It 's not wrong to use that format, for example es_ES (or xx_XX). The problem is that in Copay we are handling only the first two letters (making a global translation for each supported languages).\nFor example, if your device is configured to es_AR, you will see Copay in english, because we are matching with es_ES. For current Copay, the language es_AR doesn't exist.\nSo, we should do some changes in the code to support that denomination. I sent an email to Crowdin team asking about to modify the header of .po file, and they answered that it 's not possible for now.\nWhat do you think? Do you have any idea how to solve it?\n. This is awesome!\n. This is awesome!\n. Change language isn't working, but it 's very simple to fix. Maybe you forgot to do that:\nGruntfile.js line 129:\nfiles: {\n          'src/js/translations.js': ['po/*.po']\n        }\nAdd the right path:\nfiles: {\n          'src/js/translations.js': ['i18n/po/*.po']\n        }\n.

Hi @dan-da , thank you for reporting and help us to improve Copay.\nRegarding your issue on Firefox, you are right, we are not supporting Firefox. The function to download a file to your computer is very different in almost all browsers and platforms.\nWith Copay ChromeApp, you can download the CSV file. But if your browser is configured to download automatically to some folder, you will not see anything, but the file will be in the selected folder.\nI think we could show a message or something to notify that the file was already generated and downloaded.\n. LGTM\n. Need rebase\n. ACK\n. I found an issue in this PR using bitcoin: URI. \n- When Copay is opened by a bitcoin URI, and after choosing the folder, it finally goes to Home (instead Send).\n- Also if you are testing in a browser, refresh the page in, for example, Preferences. After page was loaded, it returns to Home.\n@troggy: let me know if you have the same trouble. \n. Hello @jlopp, thanks a lot for your contribution! \nRespect your code, you shouldn't modify the .PO files. The only files you have to commit are template.pot and walletHome.js. After that, we have to upload the pot file to Crowdin and each translator will have to update their language.\n. LGTM\n. Need rebase\n. ACK\n. ACK\n. Updated\n. LGTM. But I think you should:\n- Remove multiples transaction because it 's not supported by the UI yet.\n- Add Russian :)\n. Another thing I see about Crowdin is that We should mark the options to export only translations approved. \n```\nSkip untranslated strings\nIf checked, untranslated strings will be absent from the exported file.\nThis option is not applied to text documents: .docx, .pptx, *.xlsx, etc., since missing texts may cause the resulting files to be unreadable.\nExport only approved translations\nIncludes only texts that are both translated and approved. \nThis will require additional efforts from your translators to approve all suggestions.\n```\nWhat do you think? It 's possible using the API to download only approved files?\n. Ok, I agree with maintain approved and non-approved as same thing and also remove untranslated files.\nWe have more changes in strings on another PR. I will got to update it and then we can to upload the template to crowdin.\n. LGTM\n. ACK\n. ACK\n. Will do ASAP\n. ACK.\nThanks a lot!\n. No, in published version it is ok. This issue appears only in my dev environment.\nMaybe this is due that I did an installation from scratch (foundation css was updated or something else).\n. So, it 's a Chrome issue, because on iOS is fine. \nAnyway it is already fixed on #3105. We will release a patch soon.\nThanks for confirm this problem.\n. closes #3105\n. closes #3105\n. closes #3104\n. closes #3104\n. ACK. Just one comment (see above). Thanks!\n. ACK. Thanks!\n. Android has 4 screen size (portrait): small, normal, large and extra-large. \nThen you have density for each screen: low, medium, hight and extra-hight.\nFor example, normal screen size, you could have these values for each density: \n- LDPI (120): 200x320px\n- MDPI (160): 320x480px\n- HDPI (240): 480x800px\n- XHDPI (320): 720px1280px\nSo, I think the idea is maintain the same resolution of images and improve the quality (dpi). Take a look this: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10574363/android-splash-screen-image-sizes-to-fit-all-devices\n. The images have now more quality, but the logo Copay is still blurred. I don't know what was the original issue, the bad quality of Copay logo or the weird bands.\n. I see. So we have to add the follow new images/folders: \n- XXHDPI: Portrait: 960 X 1600px.\n- XXXHDPI: Portrait: 1280 X 1920px.\nBTW, I figured it out that the xhdpi has bad resolution: (it has 640px X 960px instead 720px X 1280px). Also the ldpi should have 200 X 320px.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Fixes #3137\n. Fixes #3137\n. Thanks! Now it works.\n. Thanks! Now it works.\n.

Hi @Kirvx ,\nI could reproduce the issue, indeed this is a bug that you found!\nThe previous code was OK. The problem appeared when we separate the disclaimerController to an external file. For example, you can see this async function in the file src/js/controller/disclaimer.js:\njavascript\nstorageService.getCopayDisclaimerFlag(function(err, val) {\n      $scope.agreed = val;\n      $timeout(function() {\n        $scope.$digest();\n      }, 1);\n    });\nThis code runs at the beginning, when storageService didn't finish to read the flag (Disclaimer). So the variable $scope.agreed is empty always.\nThe solution is to put this into a function and call it from template:\nsrc/js/controller/disclaimer.js\njavascript\n$scope.init = function() {\n      storageService.getCopayDisclaimerFlag(function(err, val) {\n        $scope.agreed = val;\n        $timeout(function() {\n          $scope.$digest();\n        }, 1);\n      });\n    };\npublic/view/disclaimer.html\n``` html\n\n<div\n  ng-if=\"agreed && index.hasProfile\"\n  class=\"topbar-container\"\n  ng-include=\"'views/includes/topbar.html'\"\n  ng-init=\"titleSection='Terms of Use';  goBackToState = 'about'; noColor = true\"\n\n\n\n\n. . . \n\n\n```\nI think this is a more clear solution because you don't have to remove a variable that is defined in controller. Please, check if it works for you.\nThank you for your contribution!\n. Hi @Kirvx ,\nI could reproduce the issue, indeed this is a bug that you found!\nThe previous code was OK.

We can't add the ionic-history condition for each page that we think could fail.. Ready for review. Updated. Hi @acars999 , regarding 2FA, Copay doesn't have 2FA. Not sure what do you mean. That phrase is all you need to recover your wallet, it 's important to write down.\nRegarding the Two-step verification error, could you provide us some more information like your device and if you received an email from Coinbase that you are trying to link the account with Copay? \nThanks.. Hi @FilipeOS ,\n1.- If you don't see any payment method, you probably don't have a valid payment method. Check in your Coinbase account if your payment methods were validated to buy bitcoin.\n2.- Since Copay release the Coinbase integration, it only shows USD because an API limitation. But in the next release it will be updated.\n3.- You can see the tax fee, total and subtotal of your purchase in the next screen, before confirm. You can also cancel the operation at any time.\nThank you for use Copay!. Closes #5950. Closes #5950. It works for me: (iOS and macOS).\nBut in the mobile I can see that after turning on the light, this remains active after changing tab.. Do you have any validated payment method in your account from Coinbase website? Check if you are able to buy/sell bitcoin. Also, there are payment methods that can't to be used to buy or sell.\nThanks.. Closed in favor of #5472. Updated. Thanks!. It 's probably an UI issue. The first installation of BitPay have Coinbase disabled. This release enable Coinbase, but we think that only for first installations. We suspect that the option in settings -> advanced you must have Coinbase disabled. Please, check it 's off and let us know if it solves the issue.\nThanks!. The app only receive an array of items from Coinbase asking for your available payment methods. If any of them has allow_buy = true, the apps will show in the form.  I think that Coinbase doesn't allow to buy with debit card using third party apps, but not sure. You should ask to Coinbase if there is any limitation there.\nThanks a lot for reporting.. The native balance of you Coinbase 's account doesn't matter in selling process. In your case, seems to not have enough funds in the app (4usd + bitcoin fee). The BitPay app doesn't use funds deposited (from USD or EUR wallets) to sell bitcoin directly. The app sends bitcoin to Coinbase, then wait for confirmation, and finally sells exactly the same amount sent previously.\nPlease, let us know if it 's your case.\nRegarding the first issue, I think that it 's an issue with the connection. We recommend to wait until it finished, not cancel manually. But we need more details to confirm this error.\nThanks.. Fixed.. > Why has that been moved? So uncomfortable! I need to create every day multiple addresses for different wallets.\nJFYI: If the current address receives bitcoin, the wallet creates a new address automatically. So, I think that in normal use, it 's not necessary to create addresses manually. . Hi, I 'm sorry you are having trouble with Copay. Could you provide us more information?\n\n\nDid you download Copay from this link: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/releases/download/v3.2.0/Copay.exe\n\n\nWhat version of Windows do you have installed? 32 or 64 bits?\n\n\nProblem happens before or after install the app?\n\n\nThanks for your patience.\n. Did you already receive the email from Coinbase that the account has been connected?\nWhat version of Copay do you have installed? Platform (iOS, Android or desktop)? \nThanks.. This 's a known issue and we don't have a fix yet.\nSome Android devices have an old or incompatible browser in order to handle custom URL's. Please, take a look at this thread to get more information and try to connect to Coinbase manually. https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5891#issuecomment-297076251. I don't know if you already saw the screen when asking for email. I think that text is clear. Email is optional for any case, but probably could be more useful on desktop (mobile already has push notification).\n\n. Updated.. Needs rebase.. Could you try to close and restart the app? If it doesn't work, try to connect to coinbase again (as you did the first time). Probably it 's an issue from Coinbase while trying to get token twice.. Could you try to \"Log out\" from Settings -> Wallets & Integrations - Coinbase -> Log out and reconnect again?. Closes #6145. Hi @sdobz , thanks a lot for your contributions. We 'll review your PR.. If your Coinbase Wallet shows the transaction as confirmed, the bitcoins you bought are there in Coinbase. Please, confirm if your Coinbase wallet have the bitcoins that you bought.\nThen in Copay side, could you check if there is an error in the transaction inside the \"Coinbase\" section? Some times Coinbase could have trouble while trying to send bitcoin to Copay (it 's a Coinbase issue, not Copay).\nThanks.. It 's a known issue, please upgrade to v3.5.\n@anoain88 go to Play Store and update the app. @stephane-rolland Hi, first that nothing, try npm run apply:copay. It will copy the complete package.json\nThen: npm start\nI hope to be helpful.. Updated. thanks.. 32 or 64 bits?. Updated. Ready for review. Updated.. Missing coinbase.html. Ok. Agree. Updated. Updated and ready for code review.. Seems to be an issue from some Android devices. Could not reproduce the error in our test lab. Please, check this thread to find out a manual solution: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5891. Sorry about that, but we need more information in order to reproduce and fix it. We don't have the same phone, all our Android devices for testing purpose are working.\nJust for rule out possible errors. Please, check if your mobile browser open this follow link:\ncopay:glidera?code=xx\nIf the previous link is not clickeable, copy it to your browser. It should try to open Copay in your phone (check the screen):\n\nIf it doesn't work, the main issue is related with some specific phones and the plugin that Copay uses to handle custom URLs: https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme. Don't need to enter 2FA code in our app. Coinbase needs to validate the new device by email after enter 2FA code in their website.. Fixes #6366. I think this functionality should be placed on tab-settings -> Wallets & integrations. Like screen below, doing click to re-order, drag as you want, finally doing click to save changes. On tab-home, the new order should be updated.\n\n. New feature for v4.. Updated.. Fixed #6376\nThanks for report.. Try\nnpm run apply:copay ; npm run start:windows\nThen open the project file with VS inside cordova/platform/windows/. Closed in favor of #6576. Hi,\nCoinbase integration doesn't support another currency. Only USD.. Hi, \nUnfortunately, you can't replay the request automatically. To get your bitcoin on Copay, you should send it manually from Coinbase app/website.\nCopay doesn't support buy/sell throught Coinbase with 2FA enabled. So, the next time make sure to have 2FA disabled before to purchase bitcoin.\nRegarding the transaction fee, only to take into account, if you buy bitcoin from Copay integration, also you have to pay fee for the transaction. For example, if your purchase is for 10usd, the total amount to pay could be a little more (Fee from Coinbase purchase, if it applies. And the bitcoin transaction fee from Coinbase to Copay).. > So I'll have to pay the \"transaction fee\" from coinbase to copay this time?\nYes, if you create a transaction from Coinbase, you have to pay the transaction fee (as every bitcoin transactions).\n\nIf I disable the 2fa, will the transaction only be 1 fee? There is currently a small purchase fee will that be the only fee if I don't have to resend the funs?\nOr is your last comment saying there are two fees.\n\nI don't know if Coinbase charges a fee for purchase with bank account/debit/credit, but I think so. Check this site: https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees\nAs well as you paid fee for purchase, you have to paid the network fee for the transaction (if you want to withdraw your bitcoins from Coinbase). Doing that from Copay, should be automatically, but in your case (2FA enabled and error), you should pay only the bank fee. Otherwise, all users should pay for network fee.\nPlease, check this site: https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/815435-does-coinbase-pay-bitcoin-miner-fees-\n\nCoinbase does not pay the network mining fee on behalf of customers for outgoing digital currency transactions.\n\nBefore March 21st, 2017, users didn't pay fee for withdraw bitcoin. Today it 's mandatory.\nIn summary, using our Coinbase integration does the process to buy/sell faster. \n. Hi @Kirvx , \nYes, it 's a known issue for INTL cards. We 're working on a fix.\nThanks for report.. Hi, it 's a known issue for some android versions/devices. Could you provide us more info of your device? Android version? Thanks.. Updated.. Hi @yhindy , I 'm sorry you are having issue with our Coinbase integration. Could you confirm that your bitcoins are in your Coinbase account thought their website? It happens because Copay can't create a bitcoin transaction using the Coinbase API without the correct permissions. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.. Transactions that already got an error, have to be completed manually creating a normal transaction from your Coinbase account (website) to your Copay wallet.\nAfter the update you should logout and re-connect Coinbase from Copay. This is due to a change in token permissions from Coinbase that solves the 2FA issue. Please, stay tuned to any update of Copay and sorry again for problems caused . Needs rebase. Are you trying with a bitcoin cash address that start with 1xx...x? If it 's your case, try to convert it to the new address format for bitcoin cash with this online tool: https://bitpay.github.io/address-translator/\n. I 'm just talking about to change address format. I mean, your address \"12Q....\" to the new format valid for copay that start with C... for 1-1 wallets or H... for multisig.\nFor example (my own experience), I sent BCH from Copay to mi wallet Bitcoin-ABC that doesn't support the new address format. So, I had to convert an address from Bitcoin-ABC to the new format using our online tool and paste the new address in Copay. After some seconds, my funds were in my wallet Bicoin-ABC.. Due to use this wallet during development version. It has been solved deleting wallet from BWS.. Updated. Title deleted in some cases. Thanks.. The main difference is that Copay needs to send the bitcoin back to your wallet. So, this additional operation (send the purchased bitcoin from Coinbase to Copay) requires a transaction fee, that is different that Coinbase fee to purchase (maybe it 's a bank fee, not sure). In order to send your bitcoin back, after the purchase, Copay creates a new transaction (with the previous charged transaction fee), to send bitcoin from Coinbase to your Copay wallet.. Some time ago, this transaction fee was paid by Coinbase. Make a transaction from Coinbase to Copay using our integration was free for fee. Today the history is a little different :(. Hi @miguelmorales85 , I 'm sorry about that. Coinbase limit us to 1,000 USD per day to send money from the user's account. We can't change it because it 's a limit that Coinbase applies for all third part applications.\nJust to understand a little more about this bug. Your initial purchase from Copay (2000USD) has been completed on Coinbase.com? I mean, do you have your BTC on Coinbase.com?\nThanks for report.. Try: \nnpm run clean-all; npm run apply:copay; npm start; open http://localhost:8100\nIf it doesn't work, please open an issue with the error.\nThanks.. Node v8.7.0\nnpm v5.5.1\ngrunt-cli v1-2-0. Could you confirm if you have the latest version of Copay (v3.6.8)? When have you linked your Coinbase account? We need to know these details to assist you further.\nBTW, If you are planning to buy again, try to \"Log out\" from Coinbase in the app: \"Settings\" -> \"Integrations\" -> \"Coinbase\" -> \"Log out\". Then, re-connect your Coinbase Account again. It will force to use the 2FA Token. \nYour previous purchases can't sent automatically. You should do it manually from Coinbase website.\nThanks.. Hi @TheHCA , \nThat 's correct, Copay and Coinbase are different wallets.\nCoinbase integration only supports buy/sell from US bank account. If you have an US bank account, this error could be related to some types of payment that Coinbase doesn't support from third party applications (API). We are working to provide more information from Coinbase in Copay side in order to understand why it fails.\nHope that helps. Thanks.. I am afraid that you have no other option that send manually from Coinbase to Copay. \nWe have plans to add \"EUR\" in the near future, but I don't know about UK. \nThanks for report.. Are your BTC available/confirmed on Coinbase.com website? Could you provide screenshots or more details of the Coinbase Integration View (go to Home->Coinbase)?\nThanks.. Updated. Do not create bch wallet on fresh installations. Thanks for report. Will be fixed in the next release.. Hola, el mensaje dice que el monto que quieres enviar, no deja fondos disponibles para la comisi\u00f3n (fee). Hay que ver la cantidad de inputs que tiene tu wallet: ve a \"Settings\" -> [ Wallet ] -> \"More Options\" -> \"Wallet Addresses\". Ah\u00ed deber\u00edas ver el total de \"inputs\" que tiene esa wallet, y cu\u00e1nto ser\u00eda el aproximado de fee que tendr\u00edas que pagar para mover los fondos.. Thanks @magmahindenburg , it will be fixed in the next release.. Hi @Begemot2500 , just to clarify. We need to understand your situation In order to assist you further.\nBTC wallet has been created on Wed Aug 02 2017 12:35:40 GMT-0300,and the app only scan BCH on wallets created before 1 Aug 2017. That 's the reason you saw no wallets eligible for bitcoin cash support\nSo, if sent BCH to a BTC wallet by error, the only way to recovery the funds is using the Recovery Tool (https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/). \nThe recovery tool works for BTC and BCH. To do that select carefully the coin you want to recover. \nHope that helps.\nThanks.. What device are you using? Please check this link and let us know if it 's your same issue: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5891. Hi @Dutchie86 , thanks for reporting your issue as well detailed. Unfortunately, it 's a known issue for some Android version and devices, that could not handle a custom URL scheme (like copay://coinbase) as expected. After Coinbase authorize to Copay to access your account, the website (coinbase.com) tries to redirect to Copay with this URL: copay://coinbase?code=xxx where code is the OAuth Code required by Copay in order to establish the connection.\nPlease, check this workaround that I hope it helps: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6396#issuecomment-330036165\nor \nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5891#issuecomment-297076251. Do you have BTC or BCH wallet? Buying gift card is only available with BTC wallets. BitPay no maneja el tr\u00e1fico en la red de bitcoin. Tu transacci\u00f3n depende de la red (no de la billetera que utilizaste, sea Copay o cualquier otra), y si el fee es bajo, no se va a confirmar en corto tiempo. Y con respecto a eso, si pasado una semana la transacci\u00f3n no se confirma, los fondos vuelven a estar disponibles (se revierte la transacci\u00f3n).. Are you trying with USD or BTC values?. It 's not an address issue, it fails for verify paypro because you are using testnet (test.bitpay.com).

Please, upgrade to latest version 3.15.2 and try again.\nThanks for report.. Please, upgrade to latest version 3.15.2 and try again (if it doesn't work, remove payment proposal and try again).. Please, check that your funds are in your Coinbase Account and sell it manually through Coinbase if you still want to sell. The message \"price falls over the selected percentage.\" means that the pricing of Bitcoin get over your selected percentage before selling. It 's a preventive action to avoid that price raising more than you expected (that could happen if the transaction takes long time to confirm).. Try to remove the pending proposal in order to unlock the inputs.. Also upgrade to Copay v3.15.2 before to try again. Which platform are you using? If you have:\n\nLinux: download Copay/BitPay-linux.zip\nWindows: Copay/BitPay.exe\nMacOS: Copay/BitPay.dmg\n\nThe other files (.sig) are used to verify the downloaded file is correct. https://github.com/bitpay/copay#how-to-verify-copay-signatures. Sorry for delayed reply. What operation are you trying to do? Sending bitcoin, top up the card or another?. The App now prevents to receive bitcoin until backup is completed. If you have an old wallet with funds (and also have the words to restore), try to remove it and restore again with your words and remember to set a spending password at import time.. BitPay includes the BitPay Debit Card (Visa) integration for top up dollars with bitcoin.. Needs rebase. Updated.. Sorry MyBitcoinZ is not an App supported by BitPay. Hi @pressDUCK , that's because payment on some QR code that requires a new version of payment protocol has changed and Copay for Windows Phone 10 won't be updated any more. If that 's possible, ask for the bitcoin address only in order to donate. Thanks.. Sorry for delayed reply, the transaction has been confirmed? Maybe it was a networking issue or something that we need to verify if problem persist. \nThanks.. It has been fixed. Thanks for reporting.. Please, upgrade your phone to iOS 11.3. \n. Thanks @gustawdaniel , will check.. Fixed: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/CSP.md .

If this PR (https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2607) is merged, this fix won't be necessary.. IMO, this feature should be transparent. If users have a new bitcoin URI or paypro URL in their clipboard, ask for continue to process the payment (or join, or import) or ignore it.

It isn't necessary if you use: {{'Passwords must match'|translate}}\n. please remove the attribute \"translate\" inside \"p\". It isn't necessary if you use: {{'Passwords must match'|translate}}\n. This line is very important for small devices. I will add again.\n. typo: debub -> debug\n. You should list only wallets ready\n. Yes it is ok. This width is in pixels by default.\n. Not set focus to first wallet. I think you should redirect to the last wallet selected. Even you already have the last wallet (when loggin you have the latest wallet), the easy mode to do that is with $location(\u2018/\u2018).\n. Yes, we can. But we should do that in another PR to maintain compatibility.\n. Good idea. I just copied from the old updateTx() function of controllerUtils service.\n. Because if I delete a wallet from \"manage wallets\" I don't want it returns to the last focused wallets and homepage. Just delete and return a callback.\n. It 's not ok. You have to import the object \"identity\" and bind this with \nvar firstWallet = iden.getLastFocusedWallet();\ncontrollerUtils.bindProfile(scope, iden, firstWallet);\n. I think it isn't necessary to add another class. Just change all tables. We have only two tables: this and the addressbooks.\n. \"px\" is not allowed here.\nbtw, width attribute is not supported in HTML5 anymore.\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_th_width.asp\n. \"row\" class duplicated. \"small-12 columns\" is important for mobile\n. Add this class (input) to \"i\" element.\n. Create Transaction Proposal? What happen in a 1-1 wallet? It should be \"Send\".\n. Don't worry, I added the text gray to all class logo-setup. This is applied to all text below logo.\n. agree, will do\n. Sure\n. It is not good put an \"a\" element that encloses lot of elements. You can to use a \"div\" with ng-click and the service \"go\"\n. You are forgetting class for \"import-profile\" and \"settings\". These sections also use the button-setup\n. Just a comment there, you can use the service \"isCordova\" that returns true or false.\n. Note that we are using a different file with *:hover attributes, not used by mobile.\n. please, remove this!\n. Please, do not change this value. It breaks mobile layout.\n. Please, remove the console.log\n. Updated. Thanks for your suggestion.\n. The same function is called twice\n. Yes. The template.pot files is out-of-date. I think we 're going to add more words in the following of days and updating the pot file. I know, it 's a hard work to maintenance, but we are currently changing words almost every days to do that all users understand Copay better.\n. When you make a payment using BIP72 (Payment Protocol URI), Copay try to get information from the URL. So, this message will show to the user while Copay downloads information about the payment (address, amount, merchant, etc...).\n. There is a typo! Please, let me fix it and push again.\n. Missing translate attribute. \n. Missing translate attributes. \n. Could you use generic language ISO-639-1? I mean, not country specific, just the language. \nIn your case, just Language: ja. We are not supporting localized languages yet.\n. It 's not working to me :( We should check it in another PR.\n. No problem. I sent you a PR with these changes. Ignore it if you already fixed it.\n. That is exactly what does. If wallet is focused, display an error. If don't, not. \nFor example (with the previous code), if we are trying to scan a wallet (not focused) that doesn't exist on the new BWS, it displays the message to recreate in the focused wallet.\n. Good idea!\n. You could add pointer class to do more user friendly for desktop versions. And the translate attribute.\n. \"Tap events...\" don't use events. This is called from view to the function: index.openWallet(); index.updateTxHistory()\n. This is wrong. translate attribute should be in span element.\n. Please, add translate attribute here.\n. Oh, you are right. I forgot to fix that. Thanks!\n. I thought the same situation, so I did some transactions with large comments with commas and another symbols, and it still works.\n. Why do you need this $emit here? It 's no longer used in this file.\n. OK. But to do a code more clean I \u2018d like to add a comment before like this:\n```\n// Used for external plugin or something\n$rootScope.$emit('Local/BalanceUpdated', walletStatus.balance);\n// Status Shortcuts\n... \n```\nThat's all. Everything LGTM.\n. Updated. Thanks!\n. I think it should be: (it.action == 'sent' || it.action == 'moved') ? '-' : '')\n. The source returns theses words in lower case. So, to avoid modify in the html, the best way is to translate as it comes.\n. I did it before to add right class :) \nRemoved.\n. +1\n. I agree\n. Please, remove translate attribute here. If you want to index.updateError to be translated, add the follow: {{index.updateError|translate}}\n. Yes, that 's the idea, because right now we haven't any common service of utilities. Maybe we need it later.\n. The logo element has to be closed by </logo>. If it 's not closed, the element below is replaced. I figured it out because the version below logo disappeared.\n. It should be:\nng-class=\u201c{\u2018enable_text_select\u2019: index.network == \u2019testnet\u2019}\u201d\n. showWaitingSign or showWaitingSync ?\n. It should be: \n$log.err(err); \nreturn;\n. It 's not an UX event\n. $log.err doesn't exist. https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$log\n. Thanks.\n. Agree. \n. Agree.\n. Why \"the wallet name\" ?\n. It 's just a label\n. It 's necessary for small screen devices\n. I think that Wallet Service shouldn't be translated\n. Double attribute translate detected\n. Same as above\n. Please, remove unused modules.\n. This action will restart Copay while I just want to view the disclaimer from Settings->About->Disclaimer.\n. I think that the attribute translate is not longer necessary.\n. I think that some platforms don't have $OSTYPE, so using $CURRENT_OS is more secure because it is passed from the command line\n. Right. Thanks!\n. Just a comment there. I think that we should enable the switch only if isCordova and (isMobile.Android() or isMobile.iOS). Not for WP.  \nAlso take a look at: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/src/js/controllers/walletHome.js#L23\nThese lines have the right way to define the variable mobile (using this)\n. What happen if err doesn't exist?\n. If you already did check that err exists, the variable name is enough.\n. Duplicated?\n. hideMenuBar should be in walletHome.html where this file is included.\n. Duplicated. This variable could be get by getShortNetworkName()\n. The style of button should be different than the above.\n. Add filter translate, please.\n. - 0 shouldn't have unit.\n- Is important required?\n. Please, use self only wherever necessary. Take a look at this example: https://discourse.codecombat.com/t/javascript-this-vs-self/3143\n. Same as above.\n. Use only the string Payment expires to translate.\n. Should return null, not $log.\n. Bad position of the translate attribute\n. Move ng-show to the row div and avoid nested div's\n. ng-disabled is not available for a elements\n. The value that receives formFocus isn't boolean. It 's an string with the names of the input.\n. Is this function used outside of self.filter?. If not, I think it should be inside self.filter.\n. It 's not necessary. The code outside the condition will complete the required info (toAddress, amountStr, AlternativeAmountStr, feeStr).\n. You are right. It 's not always defined for old tx proposals. Fixing it right now.\n. I 'm not sure that it 's useful, because search doesn't exist in the controller. What 's the idea to do ng-focus?\n. openWallet() will be opened before the other async functions. I 'm not sure it 's a good practice. openWallet() should be inside these async functions\n. Amount should be formatted before setForm\n. What about WP? If the plugin doesn't support WP, we should check it before\n. isMobile is not defined.\n. The function deleteWallet() should set the flag isDeletingWallet = true, not ng-click.\n. isMobile.iOS() is for web-browsers. Use isCordova instead.\n. Use fc defined above.\n. For iOS you set the latest version of the plugin, but for Android your are using an specific version (1.2.3). Is that ok too?\n. Please, remove console.loc\n. Tip: add class class=\"db\" to convert span in block\n. Updated #4312\nThanks!!\n. Fixed. Thanks!!\n. German duplicated.\n. +1\n. I 'm not sure if it 's the best way to block some function in the controller walletHome, like a loading action or something. I just wanted to prevent this line: \n-    if (form.address.$invalid && !ongoingProcess.get('fetchingPayPro')) {\n +    if (form.address.$invalid && !ongoingProcess.isProcessing) {\nIf this don't like it, I agree to leave it as it was until we find another solution.\n. Should be <a href ui-sfref...>, not button.\n. Wording error: Walelt\n. Close </li> if there is a translate attribute before\n. Keep $log\n. missing columns\n. It doesn't work on iOS\n. overflow-scroll is mandatory when using infinite scroll.\n. I think that it should be ng-disabled (read-only mode)\n. Variable $scope.dataFromQR is not used.\n. What about if pendingAmount is null? It happens when config.spendUnconfirmed is true.\n. Warning: cache.pendingAmount could be 0 (zero) from balance.totalAmount - balance.totalConfirmedAmount;\n. I suggest to leave as it was. null or 0 are both false\n. Agree, but it 's not working at first launch (after clicking on a bitcoin: URI). We should tweak that function in another PR.\n. Yes, you are right. Thanks!\n. I could see that error. Fixed. Thanks!\n. I think that $scope is not necessary here. Just use a local function.\n. Class ng-hide\nAttribute ng-show=\"true\"\nBoth should be removed.\n. Maybe these strings should be in configService\n. Remove translate attribute.\n. Remove \u00b4translate\u00b4.\n. This line is duplicated. The back button is working as expected.\nAnyway, we could remove the nav-bar\n. 5 stars, click on \"Not now\", the \"Share BitPay\" page is broken (it has 2 close button (X) and the nav-bar).\n. The share button should appears only for mobile.\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'socialsharing' of undefined. The share button should appears only for mobile.\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'socialsharing' of undefined. getFeeLevels function doesn't return err. Please, check the file feeServices.js. Ignore. I didn't see the file updated.. Use walletId global variable, please.. If that function is not used any more, I think that it should be removed from controller. What does the number 10 means?. Class add-address doesn't exist. Remove it and keep the id add-address. n is number of copayers. m is the number of required signature.\nI think that it should be m.. Why don't use goBack() instead?. If it is not used any more, please remove it.. Updated. Thanks!. Fixed. Thanks!. It 's not clear for translators. Should use interpolation instead: https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/api/angular-gettext/. Should be livenet. Should be livenet. Should it be $scope.status also?. Try to use angular functions like: $window or $document.. Because some mobile user that were trying to do \"swipe to pay\" and it goes back to previous view.. Got it. Thanks!. Nice!. Not necessary translate here.. The translate attribute should be inside \"span\". Updated. Thanks.. Good idea. Thanks. There are two translate attributes inside.. Thanks!. Thanks!\n. Duplicate translate.. Good idea. Thanks. Fixed. Thanks for review.. Updated. Thanks. Updated. Thanks.. Leave this as RamStorage please.. 6.2 ?. Attributes inside the Ionic elements don't work.. configProvider.get() return a typed object. Not necessary to use ['xx'].. +1. wallet param should be replaced by a single element, not an object. Ej, walletId. Same as above. Only receive walletId, then this.profileProvider.getWallet(id). Ok, I agree.. Updated. Thanks!. double ;. Remove comment.. spinner-crescent is for Android only. Using * will work on iOS also.. Typo: Marchant fee too high. Thanks! I did change that.. This prevention is set on variables.scss as: $button-md-text-transform: none. The default color is different for Copay and BitPay. We should define it as constant and select by appName (from this.appInfo). For me it 's ok, but we should add it after merge.\nEdited: I 'll check. I don't remember.. Why not just Email?. wallet.status has values in satoshi. Please, use that instead an string.. Use Coin.BTC or Coin.BCH instead a string.. This function shouldn't be called before finish(), because there is a zone.run inside. The variable expression could be unpredictable. Avoid to use pipe to get alternative amount. It doesn't work as expected sometimes.. Isn't this function useful to split amount and symbol and show them in different sizes?. I got a warning that these packages aren't necessary if I have a updated cli. I think that it 's safe to remove them.\n```\n[WARN] Detected @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova in your package.json.\n   As of CLI 3.8, it is no longer needed.

Same as above: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText. It doesn't need translation. Same as above. This action should clear the input, isn't it?. Why we should keep in that page? If users back to the app, they 'll see feedback page again. I 'm not sure if it 's a good UX.. Error could be `insufficient funds` or any other. So it could cause that the app enters in an infinite loop. Conditional should be inside `button` element, since it could be empty.. Same as above. I agree. What happen if `errorId` is not 'revoked_token'?. It 's incorrect. ShapeShift handles errors a bit different. Same as above . It doesn't work since ShapeShift uses custom url to open the app.. ShapeShift doesn't return an array of errors.. Logout should implement correct ShapeShift POST to revoke token. This method only remove token from the storage but we need to revoke the token from ShapeShift in order to avoid someone to reuse it.. ShapeShift returns an object as error: { error: 'code', error_description: 'description' }\nWe should simplify this method.. This method is not necessary for now. `message` is not defined on object `data.error`. Remove unused function for now.. Why we need accountId? `_getMainAccountId` should be used to verify that token is valid with `oauth/token/details`. `GetAccount` should be used separated for another purpose.. `refresh_token` is not used in this scope.. I 'd replace this by \"Access Token Detail\" instead. It 's not necessary here.. Missing `bitcoincash:` and `bchtest`?. No, the value is \" \" (empty). Description for FaceId is optional for `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` in plist file.. Yes. It 's necessary since Android doesn't use WKWebView. CSP doesn't work in that case, so we need to add `access origin` only for this platform.. I agree. Let me check for security changes and back to original version if it doesn't update any security issue. `cordova-plugin-qrscanner` requires `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support`, but it 's not fixed version. Check this line:``. . Install a fixed version ofcordova-plugin-add-swift-support` in our side, would avoid to install any update of this.. qr-scanner is ok. Version number on package.json was 2.6.0 for long time (maybe we forget to change it on config.xml). Previous version may break the building process with cordova 8: https://github.com/bitpay/cordova-plugin-qrscanner/issues/144#issuecomment-389976578\n.

The URL could be a deterministic output of a DHT (Kademlia?) datastore, and even exposed as a new \"protocol\", wallet://[hash] \u2013 there's no reason it needs to be an HTTP URI.\n. +1.\n. Wait, isn't this a feature, not a bug?  I'd like to be able to bookmark specific URIs and access different components of the application.\n. There is probably a list of \"Activities\" that should be accessible by editing the URL (such as /settings, /open, or /wallets, for example), while local states (modals, prompts, etc.) should not be navigable as they require context \u2013 anything that requires context should be local (e.g., after the #) \u2013 but I can't currently think of any part of the application that shouldn't be navigable.\nAre there some examples of resources that shouldn't be accessible via a direct link?\n.

Looking forward to seeing this land!  +1\n. Can you link the issue where this is duplicated?  The above is just a link back to this issue.\n. Hrm.  I don't think these are the same \u2013 #2415 is about changing the name of the wallet completely, while #2418 would be a client-side alias that overrides the real name of the wallet.  Maybe for simplicity's sake, we treat them as the same case, but I'd want both cases to be possible.\nFor example, if I'm a trusted third party in a transaction, imagine if the originator named the new wallet \"Escrow\", but I have three or four other \"Escrow\" wallets.  I'd want to \"nickname\" each of them (or provide annotations \u2013 just notes) without changing the name for all parties.\n. This is an interesting proposal.  Can you please provide a more detailed description of what this is intended to accomplish?\n. After review, I am disinclined to allow this into Copay as it depends on an outside web service.  This will cause information leakage for Copay users, as an API call is made for addresses they are viewing or using.  This is not an acceptable behavior for our intended audience.\nCan an alternative be provided that is decentralized, and/or can be derived from a local blockchain?  OpenAlias seems like a reasonable approach that deserves further investigation.\n. Hey @wdawg33, we're going to keep this one open for now \u2013 addressing the above feedback will be needed before we consider merging it.\nThis would be a great opportunity to implement a plugin system where these types of integrations become opt-in for the user.  Discussion open.\n. +1!\n. +1\n. +1\n. This would be awesome.  Huge +1 from me.  We should also publish the signed APK file to the website as part of the deploy process, so those not running any marketplace can also download and verify updates (so we should included a signed hash, too).\n. This is important to me, so I've committed a $25 USD bounty to make this happen.  While I wish they'd denominate the bounty in Bitcoin, that'll have to do for now.\n. Please re-open this thread; Bitcoin users are much more likely to be privacy-conscious, and thus more likely to be using F-Droid.  It would follow that listing Copay in the F-Droid marketplace might gain the project more users, and since submitting Copay can be automated it makes sense to re-open this issue and just get it done.\n. @matiu ping on this, I'd love to finally close this issue.  Copay is inaccessible to many of my clients as they do not use Google services.  cc: @bitjson and @gasteve, in case either of you read notifications.. This may be a duplicate of or related to #2418.\n. +1 on this as well.  I always move through this stage really quickly when showing people how Copay works, because it's where people get stuck.\nMaybe there's also an opportunity here to do local discovery on a LAN, or something \u2013 other Copayers can turn on \"discovery mode\", and when creating a wallet, you can see a list of these people and add them directly.\n. I'm going to toss in a +1 for this as well; I'm running into an issue where I now need to switch between several different BWS servers (one personal, one BitPay), which is inconvenient on mobile.  When a user joins a wallet created by someone, the address of the \"organizing service\", or the BWS server, should be supplied as part of the secret data.\nThis also has seriously interesting implications if we can turn all the BWS nodes into a mesh network, using something like @gordonwritescode's Muttr project \u2013 only the \"source\" servers store the proposals, and only the intended recipients can retrieve the messages.  See also bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service#216.\n. That's a great proposal, @dabura667.  I really like that approach.\nMy only point of contention is allowing non-encrypted transport (HTTP) at all.  Node modules like pem allow for easy automatic creation of certificates, so perhaps we could just automatically create a certificate for every BWS instance.  If we can't achieve accurate authentication just yet (need to replace the PKI), we should at least offer encryption.  See also bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service#217.\n. +1 on this issue.  I thought it was previously reported, but all I could find was #2883.\n. +1 for the background check and notification method.\n. +1 for making this a significantly higher priority.  For a consumer wallet, privacy should certainly be a leading priority (and so too should convenience and experience).\n. Yep, works in my mobile browser at least.\n.

Thanks!  In the future, you may want to keep the original requests intact and simply re-name the issue (i.e., groom the backlog) in a way that makes sense in the context of the project.

Are there any plans to support other Elements, such as Confidential Transactions or Schnorr Signatures?\n. It's been 2.5 years \u2014 what's taking so long? :thinking: . Would this use the \"mailbox\" feature of BWS to move the data?  This could set an interesting precedent for using BWS as a general-purpose messaging solution.\n. \"Archive\" is a great way to explain this.  Then have a separate list of \"archived\" wallets.  Most importantly, always be able to unarchive!\n. Can confirm this also happens on Google's flagship Nexus line, as well.  Nexus 6P here.\n. Does this prevent older Copay users who might've used Cloud Sync from recovering their wallets in any way?\n. I am aware of several non-trivial wallets with co-signers that have not migrated away from Cloud Sync as of yet, as they haven't even launched Copay in over a year.  What is the process that should be recommended to them for recovering their keys, if they are unable to access their personal backups?\n. It's possible #3158 was caused by this as well.\n.

If we are encrypting the all wallets with the same password (something that I agree, in sake of usage simplicity), it seems natural that all wallets are related to the same seed. This could have the extra benefit that all wallets could be backup'ed with just one single string / QR, the extended master private key. \n\nBacking services / Settings\n\nI think the easier way to resolve this is that settings should be:\n  [ Insight server host] \n  [ Insight server port]\n  [ ] Use ssl\n  Advanced options\n  [ Insight Tesnet server host] \n  [ Insight Tesnet server port]\n  [ ] Use ssl\nThen, the user always have configured the testnet and the livenet insight server, so he can have wallets in both.\n\nBackwards compatibility it's an issue open to discussion. One option is to break compatibility and allow importing old wallet backups to a profile.\n\nI agree on this option.

Test pass, well done.\nI am still getting:\n\nfollowing exactly the 2nd test case @maraoz reported (1-1 wallet, using test.bitpay.com).\nIt seems the problem is: test.bitpay.com takes some seconds to broadcast the TX. When hitting 'send' PP does not broadcast the TX, but check it on insight. Since the TX was not broadcasted yet, the error is shown. Afterwards, going to the Transaction proposal list, and hiting 'broadcast TX' works. (it fails to broadcast the TX, but check the blockchain with insight, that the TXID is there).\n. I deleted the branch, checked out master, pulled master, created a new branch, pulled your changes, went to test.bitpay.com, generated an invoice, copied the link; created a new wallet, sent testnet bitcoins, pasted the payment URL, tried to pay, and get the same result. \nCan you confirm you follow the step-by-step procedure described my @maraoz and you did not get the error?\n.

Hi,\nThis need to be better explained on the UX as partially described in https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/1776. \n1) You can use Copay without providing an email address. Go to setting (before creating a profile), choose Localstorage, and then create a profile. The email field on  the form should be nickname. That info, nor you encrypted wallet will never leave your device.\n2) We found that most users needed to be able to move thru devices: access the same wallet in a desktop, mobile, table, etc. So we decided add a plugin to Insight to store encrypted wallets. In order to prevent abuse, we ask for email confirmation to store that data. Once the email is confirmed, only the hash of the email is stored on the system, and copay client only sends the hash for authentication. If not confirmation is received in 2 days, both the wallet, and the email info are deleted (this is currently disabled now, since it is not explained on the UX). This is the default setting: Store encrypted profiles and wallets in the Insight server.\nAlso note that, even in the (maximum) 2 days window that Insight stores the user's emails, Insight do not link addresses to emails, and only the encrypted wallet is stored. \nClosing this one because of 1). Please reopen if this does not satisfy the request.\n. obsolted by https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/2502\n. ACK with the code, but joining a wallet, and importing a wallet to a profile should also turn on the backupNeeded flag.\n. when this PR is rebased, 4 mocha test fail. please fix.\n```\n  1) Identity model #createWallet \"before each\" hook:\n     TypeError: Attempted to wrap store which is already wrapped\n      at Object.wrapMethod (/Users/ematiu/devel/copay/node_modules/sinon/lib/sinon.js:77:25)\n      at Object.stub (/Users/ematiu/devel/copay/node_modules/sinon/lib/sinon/stub.js:56:22)\n      at Context.

Interesting idea.

The wallet had 0 transactions, but I had imported it to 2 separate devices (the same exact 1 of 1 wallet) and each one of the devices had a different address...\nSorry, my mistake. When a wallet is imported it always generate a new address.\nOK we will got to the view xpriv since that can be used  for others things also.\n. for copayers, I guess you are looking for something like\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet/blob/master/bin/wallet-confirm\nWhat you mean by tampered in transit? The wallet backup (that contains the xpubs) is encrypted and signed by the password you entered when doing the backup, so no tampering possible there.\nAlso, bitcore-wallet-service client does check signatures on copayer's requests so if the server tried to tamper or create a message it will be detected.\n. in the current version of copay, settings -> advanced -> wallet info will show the wallet's pub keys.\n.

Where we're going, we don't need roads!\n. ACK\n. The problem with this type of method is it relies on the server holding\n\neveryone's xpubs and never going down... so it's not really decentralized\nand in actuality the backup relying on the server means it's not truly a\nbackup in the sense that it would be all the info needed to recover.\n\nAgree. The backup should not relay on the server. IMO, having m backups (in\na m-n wallet) should ALWAYS give you access to the funds.\n\nAnother point to consider is maybe having each member of a wallet have a\nflag showing whether or not they created a backup. (Whether that be phrase\n- fingerprint or an encrypted full-backup) so you can know whether or not\n  the other members are responsibly backing up their wallets too. (vital for\n  x of x wallets where one key lost means loss of all funds)\n\nWe had that on Copay ~v0.3 :) Exactly as you mentioned, but it added to\nmuch friction to wallet creation. Specially in n>=3 wallets.

Hi @EricLarch,\nAn update on this: We are given a lot of thought to the recovery process. It would be great if  the wallet could be recovered only with the ledger device (or, in general, with the xPrivKey alone), using a given BWS server. To support this we need to implement a way for the client to sign and submit a new reqPubKey to the server, so he can be granted access. We are working on that now, and we expect to have ir ready by next week. We will submit a PR to your PR to update on this. This will allow users to recover their funds only with the ledger device.\n. closed in favor of https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/3143\n. updated.\n. updated.\n. - In multisig, the user needs to open a tx proposal, and then check on accept / reject / delete. It is a 2 step process, so we thought that no confirmation was needed, we didn't wont to add friction to the process.\n- In non-multisig, creating the transaction (filling the form) is a multistep process, so there is not risk of an accidental click.\nThat is why we decided not to add a confirmation popup. Users could add a passphrase for the priv key if they think you need an extra step (which of course is not the same you are proposing) .\n. Intersting. Could you explain a little more the use case?\nOn Fri, Jul 17, 2015 at 11:47 PM, dabura667 notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI have created an issue on BWS as well.\nSimilar to no-privkey backups, a blind signatory would only be able to\nobtain the following information\n1.

Payments cannot broadcasted with one of the following 2 reasons:\n- There is a network problem connecting the wallet service\n- There is a problem with the payment itself (for example its inputs have been already spent)\nThe upcoming version of Copay (1.1.3) differentiates these 2 states and will give a more accurate error message. \nWhat platform are you using? If you are sure network is fine, so there is a problem with the payment you can delete it and start over.  The creator of the payment can delete it at any time. The other participants can delete it after 24 hrs it was created.\n. If broadcast fail (which mean that bitcoind rejected the transaction), the payment proposal can be deleted with the restriction mentioned above. I was able to reproduce the state you are in. Please see the following screenshot (be sure to be using the latest Copay version available at the app store, to see the delete option).\n\n. in the screenshot it says '13 hours ago' +8h since you write. you need to wait 24 hours or ask the creator to delete the TX.

Adaptive fees, using bitcoin-core's estimatefee RPC call are far superior than fixed fees, since they use the actual status of the network, and mitigate the problem of transactions been broadcasted but not mined.  We dont see a strong case supporting fixed fees, not sure it will add any value to users if we support them.\n. We have some good news for you.\nWith the current architecture,  setting a fixed fee is simple not possible.\nThe transaction is crafted (the inputs are selected) at the wallet-service.\nCurrently the fee for the TX is specified in satoshis per KB. Since the\nsize of the resulting transaction is not know in advance by the client, it\nis not possible to specify a fixed fee. There is nothing it can be done in\nCopay to fix that now.\nWe are changing that a little so it will be possible, but it will take a\nlittle time since changes need to be make in the service, the\nservice-client and Copay. That it is on the current path. I personally dont\nthink is a great idea to specify fixed fees but I am not against of given\nthe possibility of doing it for advanced users. This change will also allow\nus to show to transaction, with the final fee, in a confirmation dialog.\nRegarding your OT, note that it depends on the money your are trying to\nsend, AND your available balance (and the size of the transaction and the\ncurrent network status).  You can have 11BTC, but if you are trying to send\n10.9999999BTC you wont be able to do it.

The user has no way of knowing how big their TX will result, or the status of the mempool. \nSetting are arbitrary total fee will almost always result on: Paying more that is needed, and therefore waisting money; or Paying less that is needed, and then the user will have to wait (even indefinitely) many blocks until the TX is confirmed.\n. > Maybe I'm just DIM but please explain to me WHY you guys think this is really a better design choice? To force the user to have to always accept ONLY the fee value that the wallet code says, and never ever any other way to accomodate different needs...? Srsly?\nThe user does not have elements to set a fixed absolute fee.  The user does not know the size of the resulting transaction, the current size of the mempool, and the fee per kb of the pending transactions on  the mempool. Setting an absolutely fee  was a first approach in wallet software, but since that we have evolve to better approach. \n\nIf the user -- for whatever reason -- just WANTS to put a twenty cent fee onto his transaction by choice\n\nIMO this does not make sense. If you make, for example, an app to buy movie tickets, you will not allow the user to pay \"whatever he wants\", even if it is his money. The ticket has a price. He can buy it or not.  Bitcoin network fees have a market price, determined by the network. The user decides how fast he want his tx to be confirmed, and the software makes the best effort to select the appropriate fee, given the transaction size.  And there is a final confirmation that the user has to accept (this was added in later Copay versions).\n\nAnd furthermore, WHAT IF this clusterfuck of a situation with the block-size limit devolves into some kind of out-of-control, exponentially increasing \"fee market competition\"...??\n\nIf that is the case, Bitcoin itself become useless (al least for the general public Copay use cases).\n. > Your analogy for a movie ticket isn't quite correct because in the movie ticket case you're not getting anything more for your money.\nThat is exactly the case.  If you have set your fees to 1 block confirmations (priority), and you \"decide\" to pay more. You get nothing.  If you decide to pay \"a little\" less, you have not idea how \"a little\" will impact on the confirmation time. If may delay the confirmation 1 block, it may turn the transaction to be never confirmed. There is a complex, non deterministic, path from absolute fee to confirmation times.\n. > NOT allowing even advanced users to have CONTROL here... is a BAD DESIGN FLAW.\nno it is not. In your car, you are not allowed to set the RPMs of the electro fan. It is your car, your battery, and your engine. But you cann't set it, because it makes no sense. A computer will set the RPMs depending on variables you don't know at all times.\nI am afraid that if this feature is so import to you, you will need to use al other wallet.  We see the option to set an absolute fee in a TX as a step back up wallet design. \nYou have  mentioned  previously  that your objective for this was to have  non-decimal numbers on you wallet's balance. I can't  question the usefulness of that, it is your money, but I do think it is not a strong enough argument to implement this feature for all Copay users.\n. FWIW, https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3888 is already implemented in BWS / Copay and will be included on the next release.\n.

Currently 'delete wallet' means 'delete from the device'\nDeleting the meta data from the server is not trivial:\n- For nonmultisig wallets, the use could have multiple instances of the wallet, in many devices. Deleting the wallet would delete his (encrypted) transaction metadata (notes), which could be undesirable.  In 1-1 wallets  or (1-of-N) maybe this could be fixed with a  checkbox at delete:\n        [ ] ALSO DELETE WALLET FROM THE WALLET SERVICE\n  what you thinkg?\n- For multisig wallets, it is more complex, since we should implement some kind of voting mechanism for deletion...\n        [ ] ALSO VOTE TO DELETE WALLET FROM THE WALLET SERVICE\n  and once the quorum of copayers have vote for deletion...BWS can delete it. Make sense?\nEDIT: Formating\n. > That makes sense.

Have I permanently ruined that possibility when I accidentally created the 1-of-1 wallet? Why can't I use the same seed for both wallets?\n\nThe seeds are also use to derive a 'copayerId' and copayerId map 1-1 to wallet.

Sure, just go to the side menu on the left -> Create Wallet.\nOnce you have the new wallet, go to receive, backup the wallet (write down the 12 words), and then transfer the funds from the old wallet to the new one.\nIf you are planning to store a significant amount of Bitcoin, consider to create a multisignature wallet, storing, for example, one key on your cel, and one key on your PC. To do that you need to go to Create Wallet and then select the 'shared wallet', and choose 2 required keys, 2 total keys.\n. Thanks for the report. We were able to reproduce it.

That transaction is eventually mined and written on the blockchain. When you log to your Copay wallet and check your balance, you are just querying the blockchain for the balance of the address in your wallet (not \"downloading\" the bitcoins). So, been online or offline does not make a difference in where the 'bitcoins are'. The transaction that transfer the bitcoins to your is at the blockchain.\nHope this answer helps to clarifies it. :)\n. > Can specify seed for Testnet wallet.\nSince recovering a testnet wallet from seed is a very special use case, we moved to the derivation path:\nInstead of using:\nm/44'/0'/0'\nmodify it to:\nm/44'/1'/0'\nthe 1 means testnet bitcoins, as specified in BIP44.\n\nSpecified seed generated wallets retain their seed until the user explicitly deletes it.\nWe were not sure about this.

I am sorry you are having problems with Copay.\nBecause some users reported DeviceID problems on Android, we disabled DeviceID encryption in v1.5. If you are using v1.5.x, Copay will migrate your storage, but to do that, it needs the right device ID. So, answering your question, for new users, this will not longer be an issue.\nFor you wallets, the simplest approach would be to recover your livenet wallet from backup. For what you need to uninstall Copay, reinstall it, and then import the backup. As mentioned above, DeviceID will no longer be used (is you install v.1.5).\n.

Thanks for the follow up. I think I find the problem here: The invitation code is not deterministic and if the wallet is deleted, it cannot be restored. Given this is a very special case, and the wallet was never completed, so it cannot have associated address or funds, I think the situation should be handle with a appropriate error message, OR,   deleting the wallet on BWS when the use 'cancels' BUT only if he is the creator of the wallet.\n\nI will edit the title to better reflect problem.\n. We should probably enhance the message in case this happen, to inform the use the invitation code is not present.\n.

In general, everytime you send a TX there are 2 outputs, the external address, the one you are sending funds, and a change address, that is from your wallet. The excess funds are 'transfered back' to your change address. Note that your wallet can have multiple addresses. And everytime you send money, a new change address if generated.\nYour wallet balance should reflect the balance of ALL the addresses of your wallet.\n. For the moment, only BIP44 paths are supported.\n. Breadwallet does not use BIP44 address derivation standard, but uses a custom schema (https://github.com/voisine/breadwallet/issues/131), therefore you can not directly import your Breadwallet seed into Copay. You will need to create a new wallet and move your funds there.\n. > Is it possible to use SPV mode similar to Bread Wallet? \n\nNo\nWhy Copay doesn't use it?\n\nThere are several reasons, some that I can think now are:\n- Because Copay is a  multisignature wallet, it already needs a coordination server to handle the transactions proposals. \n- Wallets that relies on a block explorer API can be faster to use / sync, and can use less network traffic. This is more notable in mobile devices and in places with network speed is not great.\n- Extra services can be provided by the server (like having an encrypted backup of the addressbook)\n- Notifications (like emails) can be send when incoming transactions are detected.\nWe tried to mitigate the 'centralized dependency' problem with:\n- The wallet service does not hold, not even encrypted, the copayer's private keys \n- The wallet service is open source, and anyone can be setup one, and use it from Copay, not relaying on Bitpay\n- Migrating a wallet from a server to other is just a one-click procedure in copay.\n. Tested OK. LGTM.\n. > Are there any plans to support/port copay for platforms like Sailfish OS or Ubuntu\nno plans for now. Copay relies on multiple components (like cordova, and some cordova pluggins, that will need to support those OSs first). PRs are always welcomed.\n. Could you please detail (step-by-step) you how are trying to import the backup?\nPlease use the latest copay version (1.5.3).  Also, in order you check you backup and password, please go to https://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/ enter your backup text in 'ciphertext' and entre the password and check if the password is ok.\n. ok, no problem.\nI have removed your backup text from your comment from security.\n. done\n. Could you try importing the backup in other platform and check if the problem persist?\n. thanks for the details. we will try to recreate the issue. Please let us know if you see it again.\n. New address are generated when you use then or when you manually generate a new one. Your wallet can have multiple address. You are still in control of old addresses.\nYou can see all the addresses at settings -> advanced -> wallet information\n. check in a block explorer (like insight.bitpay.com or https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC) the address. Check if the transaction is there and if it is confirmed.\n. If the transaction is not on the block exporers, it wont show on Copay. Check with the payor that the transaction was really sent.\n.

To add to @dabura667 reponse, note that the seed (12 mnemonic words) and the actual private key are different entities.  The private key can be derived from the seed, but NOT the other way around. \nThe option to remove the seed is to prevent someone to see the (relatively easy to copy) mnemonics on Copay. But the private key is still there. And can be exported.\nTo create the wallet without the seed and without the private key, you need to export it without the private key, as @dabura667 explained.\nPlease let us know any doubt.\n. > 1- So if I delete the seed, how copay generates new addresses?\nIt still has the private key stored ( when I say private key, I mean the Extended Master Private Key, in the BIP32 sense).\n\n2- If I Export the wallet, then I delete the seed, then I create many new addresses.

Version 1.9.4 will be there soon.\n. @gehlm thanks for the update\n@chrisrico When you recreate a wallet in a BWS, the metadata of the transactions (like the notes) are lost. See https://github.com/bitpay/copay#copay-backups-and-recovery\nAlso, if you are using a new BWS, and importing the wallet from the TREZOR alone (ie, not from a 'Export Wallet' file) the shared key used to encrypt messages (so BWS cannot access them) is not available (because is derived from the initial shared wallet invitation). So it is not possible to create TX with messages in that case.  The message field should be disabled in that case (I have spawn a new ticket for that one: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3984).  The case you are using (new BWS, and importing only from mnemonics or only from public key (Trezor in this case) in multisig wallets is the most difficult one, and should only be used to recover the funds and move them to a new wallet.  Please try to create a TX without notes, if the problem persist, let us know we will try to solve https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3984 ASAP.\n. @chrisrico definitely yes. You need to call addWalletPrivateKey in the corresponding credential item in the profile.  (each credential is for a wallet). \n.

Where we're going, we don't need roads!\n. \nWe support Bitcoin, and most of the work we do (by FAR) is related to Bitcoin. \nWe are now in the process of developing a new UI (Copay V4) and that is our main priority.  We think segwit support is not as critical as to interrupt our current developments.   On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of users had BCH in Copay and enabling them to access to them, easily, (given the financial implications) was critical.\nWe are now testing a new version of Insight-api that will have better support for segwit and we expect to release it soon (it is a complete rewrite of insight-api), so some progress is been made in that front.\nI understand your frustration, but we have tons of things to work and we try to prioritize them the way we think are more relevant to our users.\n. @coty-crg Copay already support BCH\n@martindale segwit support will happen in Copay, but there are plenty of features to be developed. If you need faster support we are happy to receive PRs.\n@gustawdaniel bitcore-lib already support segwit. More testing is needed. Then, Bitcore-Wallet-Server  need to be updated.\n@Schknheit No, it is not.. Do not merge this, until https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4007 is resolved.\n. Closing this one, see  https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4007#issuecomment-206469275 for reference. We can revisit this PR lated.\n. For security (in order to prevent malicious app to grab the seed) copy is disabled for wallet seeds. You will need to copy it by typing it, if you want to store it online.\n. When xPrivKeyEncrypted is present, means  that the wallet as a 'password' set (\"Request password\" option in security settings in current versions).  In order to decrypt the xPrivKey, you need that password.\n. No, ATM we only support ledger thru the Ledger Chrome App, which (AFAIK) does not support Ledger Unplugged.\n. Copay does not use iCloud to prevent the private key leaving the device. Previous versions of Copay used to use it, but we disabled it for security reasons. I am afraid that if the there are not backups, it is not possible to recover the wallet.\nRegarding the UX: Copay forces the user to make the backup before showing the address of the wallet. Current versions even test the backup before showing the address.\n. Thanks a lot for your comments.\n\nIt's very easy for a user to just skip the backup step.\nIn order to prevent that, the current version of Copay forces the user to demonstrate that she have copied it. \n. I still don't completely understand how the private key could have been removed from the original device\n\nYou mentioned that the user migrated to a new device. Since Copay does not use iCloud for security reasons, the migration of Copay's wallet need to be done manually.\n\nWhere was this data being stored if not on the device hard drive or in the application data on iCloud? \nLocally in the device.\n\nthanks.\n. > So the private key would still be on the original device if it wasn't wiped, correct? \nYes that is corret.\n\nI had the user turn the original device back on and enable wifi but CoPay on that device still shows zero bits. They claim that they had not yet wiped the device, however they did have to redownload CoPay on that device  from iCloud for some reason.\n\nIf Copay was uninstalled, its related data is erased. But if it was not uninstalled, the Private key should be there.\n\nSo my final question is: is there a way to reconnect a redownload CoPay wallet to a private key that is already on that device from when the wallet was originally installed?\n\nCopay use iOS's file system. As long as the file system was not deleted, and Copay not uninstalled, the priv key should be there.\n. this is fixed in 2.1\nand in Trezor /2.1 with https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/4491\n. dup: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3739\n. fixed on 2.0\n. fixed on 2.0\n. ACK, good job!\n. What version of Copay are you using? (you can see the version on the left sidebar).\n. BTW, you should NOT use Chome browser windows for a real wallet, it is only meant for development.\n. no problem. thanks for the update.\n. @gabrielbazan7 Could you confirm is working for you?\n. @gabrielbazan7 Could you confirm is working for you?\n.

Given that is an advanced feature, I like that is self explanatory. @Kirvx what about we put \"Password for the recovery phrase\" when possible, and just \"password\" when it does not fit. For example we can leave \"password\" here:\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/4109/files#diff-8d05805f74f9ce3f1a53ae0c3ffd4acbR92\nand and places like:\n<label for=\"createPassphrase\"  ><span translate>Add a Passphrase</span>  <small translate>Add an optional passphrase to secure the recovery phrase</small>\nwe could say:\n<label for=\"createPassphrase\"  ><span translate>Add a Password</span>  <small translate>Add an optional password to secure the recovery phrase</small>\nAnd for the last one:\nPassword => I think the best is \"Spending password\" so there is no confusion.  Regarding PIN, it is not possible to just enter the PIN since this password is to encrypt the private key, so a 4 or 6 PIN number won't be enough. \n. What Copay version are you using?

We tried on an Android 6 device (Nexus 5), with new wallets, and with wallet from testnet and livenet from users that reported the error, importing from mnemonic and export. So far no luck.\nWhat we know?\n\nThe error seems to be present only on Android 6 devices. On some Android 6 devices. On the devices which shows the error, Copay is sending EMPTY signatures to the server, so the signatures are rejected. We are sure it is not a problem with the wallet (wallet corruption) and it is not server side (Wallet can be exported and imported to other devices and it will work there).\n\nWork arounds:\n\nRecover your funds from Copay's recovery tool: https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/\nOR install Copay and import your wallet in other device: We support desktop platforms, Chrome apps, IOS and WP also. See https://copay.io\nOR Downgrade to Copay 1.10.x (reported by @chaosgrid )\n\nHow can I help to fix this bug?\nWe are working hard to find the source of the error, but until we are able to reproduce it, we need your help. We have been releasing Copay BETA versions with incremented logs so you can try to sign a transactions and then send us the log.\nWe just release Copay BETA Version 1.12.3 (version code 928)  https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.bitpay.copay\nThat will show details of the signing error on the messages show at the Send tab (in the red box).\nPlease try to sign a TX with that version and send us the contents of the error.\nWe really appreciate your help and patience.\n. Thanks @TravellingGuy  / @chaosgrid @lclc for the screenshots.\nSo it seems that the derived extended private keys is not the required one to sign the proposals. The initial derivation ( usually m/44'/0'/0') seems to fail and deliver a different result in these devices.\nWe just upload a new version of the BETA (1.12.6) that derives the xpriv in a slightly different manner and adds more log. We think this could be a small different in the Javascript implementations.\nPlease try 1.12.6 (code 958) at BETA at\nhttps://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.bitpay.copay\nand let us know. In case of failure, the xpriv will be printed on the screen. If that happends, and your are working on a Livenet important wallet, DO NOT share the screenshot here.\nthanks a lot.\n. @eleuteromaniaco \n\nBut importing his seed on my iOS Copay or OS X Copay didn't work, it said that the server was not authorizing it. \n\nWas that a testnet wallet?\n. @eleuteromaniaco\n\nBut importing his seed on my iOS Copay or OS X Copay didn't work, it said that the server was not \nauthorizing it.

Please follow the discussion here:\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4133\n. @Matiasfx that android version are you using?\n. This will be probably fixed in Copay 2.0, releasing today.\n. I am not familiar with bitsquare, but if you import from mnemonic be sure they support BIP44.\n. This seems to be related to a bug we have in certain android 6 devices. Please see \"Workarounds\" at #4133 (comment)\nClosing this ticket. Please continue the thread in the link.\n. You backup is the key. The 12 words are the seed to generated the private key. \nYou can access the funds on any BIP44 compatible wallet. There is also the Copay Recovery Tool:  https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/.\nFinally Copay and its backend server are open source you can even host it yourself.\n. Copay shows a receiving address in the 'Receive' Tab.\nYou can see you wallet's addresses in Settings -> Advanced > Wallet information.\n.

ACK\n. Newer versions of Copay / BWS encrypt wallet names and copayer names so BWS do not know that information.\nPush notification are send by BWS so that information is not available any more (old push use to show the Wallet Name).\nMaybe we can do that optional so users can decide whether or not to encrypt their wallet name? Other option will be to add color or similar to the notification.\nFinally, note that taping on the notification will take you to the right wallet. The notification has a hash of the walletId.\nClosing this issue since this is the intended behavior, but please let us know that you think about the above ideas.\n. depends on bwc 2.4.0 (https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-client/pull/259)\n. Thanks for your interest in Copay. For the moment we dont plan to support Solarcoin, but since Copay is opensource it is possible to fork it and adapt it. Some  alt coins have done that already.\n. utACK\nthanks!\n. Nice! We will bundle it soon!\n. All outgoing transactions are shown on your wallet transaction history (Activity on the main Copay page). Check if the transaction is there.  Note that the bitcoins are never sent to Bitpay. \n. Great work!\n. no, it does not. ATM we have no plans to integrate with KeepKey.\n. it is 0.00012740 BTC\nwitch is equivalent to 127 bit (1,000,000 bits = 1BTC).\n. Great Idea,\nI this a FAQ will be a great start:\n- Why my address changes?\n- Do I still own old addresses?\n- Do I need to backup my wallet many times?\n- etc.\nThanks.

Hi!\nYou need to buy Bitcoins using your currency on a exchange.  There are several exchanges around the world, look for one in your country.  When buying, you will need to provide you Copay bitcoin address (on the receive tab) so  the  buycoins can be sent to you.\nNote that you dont have  \"an account at copay.io\".  Copay is just a tool for handling your bitcoins keys, and the keys are only hold by your device, so be sure to backup them by writing the 12 words on a safe place.\nmat\u00edas\n.

Handling wallets with many transactions is one of the key objective of Copay. Currently there are many active wallets with tens of thousand transactions. Copay and BWS have some optimizations to reduce the impact of inactive wallet address in the UX and in the refresh procedures.\n.

Could you please explain the issue on more detail? Adding a screenshot could help.\n. Could you tell us the address? we can check is that belongs to a Copay wallet, and when it was created.\n. That address belongs to a Copay wallet. It was created on Jul 15, and the corresponding walletId ends with be87eb6f6c93.  It is the FIRST address of the wallet, so no scanning should be needed to access the funds.\nIt must be that the wallet you are recovering is not the one that own that address. Check in Copay: Settings > Advanced > Wallet Info for the walletId. Check if  it ends with be87eb6f6c93.\n. I am afraid you need to recover the wallet ending in be87eb6f6c93 in order to recover access to your funds. having access to the other wallets wont help. Check if you have the recover phrase written somewhere.\n. It could be an issue related to Cloudfare. Check that you can access \nhttps://bws.bitpay.com/bws/api/v1/version\nfrom that device. It could be that Cloudfare is banning your IP.\nWe did not change anything on BWS / BWS's servers in the last 2-3 days.\nBTW, it is a VERY bad idea to use a version that old. We do not support it by any means and it literally has dozens of (already discovered and fixed) errors on it. Your bitcoins are in high risk, please upgrade.\n. (sorry, I closed this one by mistake)\n. We did not had reports from other users or our monitoring system so I guess must be some local networking problem.\n. Can't you copy the address into the To field in the Send tab of your wallet?\n\n. xPrivKey must be there, please recheck.\nAs @dabura667 suggested,  you can generate m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 from it (using https://bitcore.io/playground/#/hdkeys) , of from the 12 word seed (using something like https://dcpos.github.io/bip39/)\n. You can decrypt the backup using something like:\nhttps://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/\nThen you will see keys like xPrivKey and xPubKey.\nAlso you can get you keys from the 12 word recovery phrase, using tools like:\nhttps://dcpos.github.io/bip39/\n. \ud83d\udc4d a very long standing feature request!\n. could not reproduce it on OSX. Usage goes to <1% when the app is not been used.\n. Hello,\nfor the moment there are plans to integrate with Keykeeper.  You may also want to consider a 3-3 wallet, using 1 software key (like a cel phone) and 2 hardware keys. Or a 2-2 with on software key (cel phone) and 1 hardware wallet.  \nNote that compromising the funds on the mentioned 2-2 wallet would mean that the attacker hack the hardware key (something that AFAIK has never been done before) and also hack the key at the phone (which at least for Copay we never had reports before), so IMO it will be very secure while convenient  to use.\nYou may also want to explore our Air-Gapped operation flow (https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet#airgapped-operation) using a CLI client called 'bitcore-wallet'. You can have something like a  hardware wallet + air gapped copay signer.\n. I meant to say there are no plans to integrate with keykeeper.\n. As you mention, because the multisig nature of Copay,  it will be tricky to let the users edit a transaction description.

Obsolete.. To display an error we should use:\nerrorString = bwcError.msg(err, gettextCatalog.getString('BWS Error'));\nWhile not ideal, is the way it is used on somewhere of the code already, and it gives more flexibility. I am sending a PR to update some parts we should be using it.. This is for the QR for the mnemonic, right?. Hi @mr-j0nes \n\nThere is an error on the text of the app, that leads to this issue.\nThe passphrase that is optionally set at the moment you create the wallet is an optional salt to the \"words to private key\" derivation. (See https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#from-mnemonic-to-seed ). It does not encrypt the wallet.  This passphrase is only useful to protect the WORDS: if you store the 12 words somewhere and an attacked grabs them, he will need the passphrase to derive your wallet. But it does NOT protect the wallet once it is installed on the device. For that you need the \"spending password\", that encrypts the private key, and it is asked everytime you need to use it.\nWe will fix this text error (that only happens in Bitpay App, not in Copay) today, and release a new version with the fix.\nThanks a lot for the detailed report.\n.

Thanks!. Great job!. It should said WB instead of WD, sorry about that. I Just sent a PR to fix it.. > When exporting a wallet backup, there is the option to include or omit the private key. Am I correct in assuming that if you exported the WB without a private key, but still had 4 wallet seeds elsewhere (of a 4 of 6) that you'd be able to recover the wallet? Or does the WB need to be exported with a private key included?\nYes, that would be ok. WB has the extended public keys of all copayers (so it can derive addresses independently).  Note that having the 4 seeds + the same BWS you used when the wallet was created, also is enough to access the wallet (since BWS has all the extended public keys also).\nIn case you are planning this for a enterprise or long-term storage, I recommend you test the schema before actually using it, to be sure you understand it right.   . updated..

I appreciate we can all\ninspect the (open source) code, of, both, BWS and client software. We can\neven run your own BWS; I understand all that. Yet, many (most) of us will\nuse Bitpay's own BWS, do not compile binaries of client apps from source,\nand are using online systems/devices (and networks) that could be\ncompromised in one way or another. Too me, it seems, there's too much\ntrust, needed, in all these aspects, when generating a brand new wallet,\nthat could, in the future, hold significant assets. I would ask the\nfollowing questions, which lead to the enhancements that I'd propose:\n1.\nWhile some software won't even allow one to create unencrypted\n   wallets, none of the Copay clients even allows for encryption passwords\n   AHEAD of generating the brand new seed, keys and files. I don't like that\n   this was saved unencrypted on my device, even for a minute.\n   2.\nBitcoin, HD, etc. all has been designed, from the bottom up, to work\n   completely off line. I understand the need to connect to other copayers,\n   and retrieving transaction labels. Yet, there's a first-things-first, here.\n   I feel deeply uncomfortable that I have to stay online to generate my seed,\n   back it up on paper, delete it and encrypt my wallet. In fact, i should be\n   able to do all that on a different (off line / air gaped / smartphone\n   flight mode / unplug / clean boot image) device. I know this is possible,\n   technically, today. Yet I'd have to construct an encrypted JSON from\n   scratch all manually, by myself, as none of the tools and clients offer any\n   support.\nIn summary, I think one should be able to generate Copay (single/multi\nsig) wallets, offline. And there should be no need to go online until after\nseed has been deleted and wallet is thoroughly encrypted. I should be able\nto to everything that requires my wallet encryption password (create\ntransaction, export, etc.) offline. An already signed / pending proposal or\ntransaction can then be submitted, when back online, without further\nrequesting this spending password.\nI think Bitpay/Copay's got a great future, ahead, yet there's still some\nthings to learn from the likes of Electrum, I believe, in terms of security\nThanks\nDaniel\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5367, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAGCHKglF9aob4meKly65sjaJIiJUTGXks5rM08GgaJpZM4LXX00\n.\n\n\n-- \nBitPay.com\n.

Copay targets general users. IMO, if\nwallets would need to ask the users to disconnect their phone from the\nnetwork to sign a tx or create a wallet, bitcoin will die the next day.\nIf you are really sensitive about this, I recommend you use the airgapped\nmode of bitcore-wallet (https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet), a CLI\nwallet made also by us, which is compatible with Copay.

If you received the 0.083BTC in thousands of small transaction, your TX will have to have thousands of signatures, therefore it will be big. The fee depends on how big is the transaction in kbytes.\nIs 0.083 all you have on the wallet? If  that is the case, you can try \"send max\" which will optimice the output amount to move only worthy inputs.. You can get an idea of you \"usable\" balance by trying to send all funds to other wallet.\n\ncreate a new wallet in bitpay app\n\"send all\" from your current wallet to your new wallet. This will let you know how much money is really usable. Be sure you have your fee see to super economical.\n\n. > Again how can i connect coinbase again? again i accidently removed my coinbase Third-Party Applications from coinbase settings.\nSorry for the inconveniences.

Hi, can you explain exactly when are you getting that error? (after what action). Also, which is the approximate amount of the transaction and which Fee level policy you have set?\nthanks. The problem is the amount is too small, so the fees are bigger or similar\nto the amount, and as a safeguard, the tx is rejected.

Furthermore, documentation should exist to\nimport a multisig wallet managed by Copay to another major client.

Your OP is misleading, there is no indication Copay is generating wrong or 'hacked' address. The fact you were able to recover your funds with the seed alone is a proof of that.  \nIn the last 24 hours the bitcoin network was very congested and fees keep going up, so TX had a lot of problems to get confirmed and many of then where dropped from the pool.\nClosing the issue since you mention you fix it be importing the fee on mycelium.. FWIW, @Derrick- is not part of Bitpay Team. Anyone can respond this conversation.\nCopay and most wallets for cryptocurrency wallets that way, you need to take care of the backups. If you prefer a more \"bank\" approach, in which a company manage your keys, I suggest you try Xapo or Coinbase.\nmat\u00edas. > No, the funds are kept on Copays servers and Copay is responsible for\nhelping the client recover any funds that are on Copays servers.\nThat is incorrect. The only way to move your bitcoins is to sign a transaction that only the client has. The key is stored client side, and the is a forced backup procedure when a wallet is created. With that backup you can derive the key again and move the funds. But the key never is send outside the device.\n.

Copay servers do not store your bitcoins, it has been explained to you multiple times,and  copay itself explain this when it force you to do a backup. I suggest you to expend sometime trying to understand how bitcoin works before wasting your time, and ours, here.\n. This error was fixed on Copay 3.5.1.\nThe problem happened when importing Hardware multisig wallets with Account >1. The account number was not been set correctly, so the signatures where rejected.\nTo solve, please delete and reimport your wallet.\nthanks.. Sorry  the delay:\n\n1- regarding the setting of fees in copay, why did I do wrong? I don't understand the discrepancy between what is indicated in the app and the actual result.\n\nWe use bitcoin-core fee estimation. This algorithm reset itself if the server restart. I could had happen that you sent the TX while that was happening, we had made some changes on our backend to prevent this from happening again (i.e. to \"warm up\" the server after it restarts).\n\n2- regarding my stuck transaction, what can I do? The app does not allow to increase the fees, right?\n\nYou can wait until it is dropped from the mempool (~3 days) or chain a TX will higher fee. We are working on a feature within copay to do the second option from the app, in a friendly manner.\nThanks\n. To understand this issue better:\n\nIs this a 2-2 wallet?\nWas the wallet a ledger + a software copayer?\nDo you have the full backup seed (words) from both the software and the ledger?\n\nYou dont need to recreate the wallet,the wallet is at BWS, you just need to import it on a new device.  Start with the backup of the software copayer and let us know. . Given that the wallet is rather complex I think it will be better that we handle the problem by email. We will need some private info from the wallet (like the walletId), are you ok with that? My email is matias@bitpay.com. This problem was fixed on 3.5.0\nEvery single request Copay does to BWS is signed using a key derived from the wallet. In normal software wallet, we use a hardened (1'/0) private key to sign, in a HW wallet, we cannot ask the  device to sign each request ... so we derive the \"request signing key\" using some entropy provided by the HW device. Because of that, \"import from the seed\" need a special proceeding if the seed is from a HW wallet. We add a toggle so the user can specify if the key is coming from a HW device. \nWe have successfully test importing multisig HW wallets from seeds using the new interface. Thanks for the report.\n. Ask the send for transaction ID and check it on a block explorer. If it shows on a block explorer and the TX is confirmed let us know an we will check it. Please reopen is that is the case.. > I already am using Bither for as my non-HD wallet. It would have been better if Copay could do too!\nAs @dabura667 suggested,  copay is focused on HD wallets. Adding individual private keys will break our backup procedures, so it is not something we plan to do.\n\nBtw, is Copay considering implementing signing/verifying messages? It has become a need for signed messages for some sites and also for other purposes. It will be great if it is added! \n\nYes, we will add this soon. \n. It this is a multisig wallet? We only support Ledger multisig.. Sorry, we only support English and spanish.. Where exactly you clicked? Could you send a screenshot and include the URL in the shot?. Hello, have you sent bitcoin before from you wallet? \nIs this is a multisig wallet? Could you send us a screenshot? Thanks.. Hi, we were able to reproduce this problem. It happens for certain amounts. We will send a fix ASAP, version 3.7.1.   As a work around, you can try the topup with a slightly different amount. Thanks.. ACK. Hello,\nHere is a procedure you can use now, for non-multisig wallets (personal wallets):\n1- Move all your bitcoins to from your current Copay/Bitpay wallet to a new Copay/Bitpay wallet\n\n(add a new wallet, back it up in a safe place, then go to send, select the new wallet, and then select \"send max\" and select the wallet you want to claim for BCC).\n\nBecause BCC implements transaction replay protection, moving your funds after the fork to a new \nwallet will generate a transaction that is invalid on the BCC chain. so, you BTC will move to your new wallet, and your BCC will stay on the old one.\n2-  Import your old wallet seed (balance should be 0 in Copay) to a BCC compatible wallet (see wallets at https://www.bitcoincash.org/). \nSo, your BTC will stay on your new wallet in Copay/Bitpay App, and your BCC will be on the BCC compatible wallet.\n===\nWe are working to adapt our recovery tool https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/ to support BCC. When that work is finished, you will be able to move your BCC balance with it, even for multisig wallets. Please follow the issue progress at: \nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery/issues/49. Copay/Bitpay app  recovery tool supporting Bitcoin & Bitcoin cash has been deployed. You can use it at https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/  source at  https://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery.\nYou can check and recover you BCH balance using that tool, for single or multi signature wallets.\nI am opening a new ticket regarding Bitcoin Cash support on Copay itself at:  https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6557. @vinicius03 That was because the resulting TX had more that 1KB. Could you please try again, we just updated to a new version.. done.. \nActually, the meaning of the message is that the amount you are receiving is to low, and redeeming it (i.e. adding that incoming UTXO to a transaction) will probably cost you more that the value it self, due to the miner fees.\nWhen you send a transaction, you compose the funds  you are sending from one or more incoming transactions  you have received in the past. For each incoming transaction you have received on the past, the cost of the miner fees increase. If the amount of the incoming transaction is \"too low\", it could not make economical sense to use it.\n. what is Helix?\nOn Tue, Aug 15, 2017 at 3:23 PM, mvalenti34 notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nOn Tue, Aug 15, 2017 at 2:13 PM Javier Donad\u00edo notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi, can you explain your scenario because I cannot understand what\nhappens\nto you.\nWhat app, device are you using ?\nDo you have any screenshot or something so I can assist you better?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6572#issuecomment-322545154,\nor mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-\nauth/Adm1cPlH0AlrKFmi6MjQTL9c-uB2dMWXks5sYd_egaJpZM4O35kB\n.\nHi!

I want to send 0.5 BTC to address 124. Copay will send 0.5 to 124 and 0.5 to 125, with the latter being an address under that same wallet. One input, two outputs.\nWanted behaviour:\nWhen the \"do not send all balance\" (or something similar) is on, Copay will just create a transaction to 124 with 0.5 and 123 will keep the remaining 123. One input, one output.\n\nHola Pablo!\nThat is no possible. In Bitcoin, each UTXO (unspent output) must be used in full in a transaction. That is why a \"change\" address have to be specified in the transaction.\nCopay offers \"single address wallets\" (set a wallet creation time) in which a single address will be over an over.

Hi, for the moment, Bitcoin Cash wallets always used \"normal\" policy fee (fixed in the code). Given the Bitcoin Cash network status, there is no value difference for the different policies (and we except to be always like that ;-) )  We need to adjust the UI to better reflect that.. We are working on this this week, please see https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6645. Thanks for the bounty offer @pmethod !\nI think this is an important feature. I commit to reviewing the code if someone sends a PR. . [ Removing comments not related to OP]\n@bektar Please let us know any of the addresses holding the funds so we can check the wallet.. Hi, sorry you are having problems. Yes please, if possible send us one of the addresses that used to had funds and the walletId (my email es matias@bitpay.com). so we can check it on detail. The wallet's transactions should be listed. . Ping @cmgustavo . You should talk to the exchange to claim the bitcoin you sent to them by mistake.. In order to implement CASH support for HW wallets, HW providers must provide cash signature APIs. Please talk to your hardware wallet provider to implement Copay support for BCH. . add cash signature to:\nhttps://github.com/trezor/connect#sign-transaction\n. thanks!

Please see https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6803 to follow this issue.. @axenter please wait a bit, v3.8.5 is been deployed gradually in the store.. Hello, thanks for the information. Do you know that wallet software are already using the 145' path?. Path 145' is not supported by Bitpay Wallet, while it is an easy fix, it will break old wallet's compatibility.  We would need to support both, and scan both after wallet import, we plan to do it someday, but it is not in our immediate priority task list. We are not changing the name. Copay supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Testnet. \"Bitcoin Wallet\" is an appropriate description.\n. > Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin specifically made to attack Bitcoin.\nWe appreciate all points of view, but we will not have that discussion here. \nWe see Bitcoin Cash as a legit cryptocurrency, providing alternative ways to scale Bitcoin.  In the future, it may disappear, or overtake Bitcoin core; or they could both coexist. We think that now, the best service to our users is to support both in our wallet. \n. We are not changing the name. Copay supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Testnet. \"Bitcoin Wallet\" is an appropriate description.. Thanks for the info @runn1ng . So there is no need to make any change in our side ?. fixed on Trezor side..

Please try a 'scan address for funds' in Settings > Wallet > More Options > Wallet addressess.\nSometimes, on new multisig bch wallet, the automatic scan is not properly triggered. we will fix that soon.. @DesWurstes definitely yes. If there is a new standard for Cash, we will adopt it.\nHere is a small description of the address conventions we use:\nhttps://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004671663-BitPay-s-Adopted-Conventions-for-Bitcoin-Cash-Addresses-URIs-and-Payment-Requests\nIn order to move forward we needed to differentiate bitcoin and bitcoin cash addresses, otherwise our users will be extremely confused.\n@monsterbitar p2sh addresses (for multisig wallets, in case of Copay) for cash start with \"H\", p2pkh, with \"C\". \nYou can translate the addresses to the other version using https://bitpay.github.io/address-translator/\n. As with all forks, it will depend on the market acceptance for Bitcoin Gold.\nATM there are no plans to support it. Of course you will be able to access your Bitcoin Gold tokens, because in Copay you control the private keys. . In version v3.9 it is possible to access the extended private keys of Copay's wallets from Settings > [wallet] > more options  > extended private key.\nPlease be very careful where you use that key since it could be used to access your coins (your bitcoins AND bitcoin gold).

Now wallets appear in different cards, and in the wallet selector, in other tabs, appear in different sections also.\nBesides that, Copay is the only Bitcoin Cash wallet that enforces different address versions for Bitcoin Cash, to avoid confusion, and there is no way inside the app to bypass that format.. ack. Your transaction has a conflict, probably a double spent.\nThe raw transaction is:\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\nMaybe on of the inputs of your tx was used or dropped before your TX was confirmed.

In the original ticket we asked for any information to identify the wallet so we can investigate further. That information was not provided. . @Cr250cra1 it depends on how big is the transaction. It is impossible to know only with the amount. if you have multiple inputs, the transactions get bigger, therefore a bigger amount is needed to pay the fee.. Thanks a lot for the report (specially @travoc !). \nThe issue is related to the journaling file of Chromium, used be NW.JS and Copay desktop versions. Last changes are stored there temporarily as a way to restore the data in case of a crash, I think we can fix this using https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/save-persistent-data-in-app (Saving a plain text file directly to disk, instead of ChromeStorage). But since we are migrating to Electron https://electronjs.org/ we will check this issue in the next version, and obsolete the current one.\nWe will update this issue if we figure a way to disable the Chrome data log's or when the new version is released.. This is fixed by:\n1. The wallet now asks the encrypting password BEFORE storing the wallet, so the wallet's seed never gets into the storage unencrypted.\n2. We have migrated to electrum, we no longer use Chrome Apps with maintains a log/journal of the storage.. @carlosgfranco this has nothing to do with Copay. If you put a fee lower that is recommended by a bitcoin network, you can end up with this situation. Your TX will be unconfirmed up to 3 weeks, some nodes will have it on the mempool, others no.\n.

The fee estimation itself, is provided by the bitcoin client (bitcoin core) thru the RPC call estimatefee.

Hi Mark,\nI understand you point but I dont think that is the case.\nBitpay only assures the exchange rate for 15 min. That is a risk way beyond\nmost exchanges. Supporting transactions that confirm in 4/6 blocks would\nmean Bitpay will only be able to exchange the coins for the merchant in\n40-60 minutes after issuing the exchange rate, which is unacceptable.\nI am.only telling you my version of it.

Hi,\n\nWhile the feature is quite interesting for the advanced users, the recovery phrase password turned out to be too complicated for normal users, because it was easily confused with the recovery words and the storage-encrypting password. That is why we decided to remove it, even from \"advanced\" settings.\nThere are no plans to remove it from importing, to support old users. Also, our recovery tool  (https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/) supports it.\n. Thanks a lot for the detailed help.\nthankfully the code with the malicious package was not deployed in any platform. We will remove the dependency now.\nWe are contacting copay-dash, which is a fork of this proyect, to let them know.\n==\nFurther examination of the code was relieved we did release some platforms with the affected code. We still investigating and communicate ASAP.. Our team is investigating this issue and the extent of the vulnerability. Currently we have only confirmed that the malicious code was deployed on versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 of our Copay and BitPay apps. However, the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code. If you are using any version from 5.0.2 to 5.1.0, you should not run or open the Copay app. We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users.\nA security update version (5.2.0) has been released and will be available for all Copay and BitPay wallet users in the app stores. If users do not see the updated version, please try again momentarily.\nAs this affects private keys, we recommend users immediately update the affected wallet and send all funds from any affected wallets to a brand new wallet on version 5.2.0 by using the Send Max feature to initiate a transaction and not by restoring using the wallet's twelve word phrase.\n. @mshanx Copay have been submitted already, there should be available soon. There are available already in some platforms. You can import your seed on Bitpay Wallet app & access your wallet there.\nAlso, we have reported and taken down the endpoints where the malicious code post the data, so they are not working now.\n@atomantic Thanks for your comments and suggestions.\nWe will be taking multiple measures to mitigate future issues like this one. The dependencies problem on node.js is a huge problem and many projects are facing issues like this. Almost 4000 projects were \"infected\" just to access Copay. On the other hand, trying to build a competitive app, GUI-wise, multiplatform not using JS seems impossible.\nSome of the measures we are doing:\n\nFreeze dependencies and add them to the repo, so we can see diff when upgrading deps. This will be practical sometimes, be definitely not always.\nRestrict network access within the app.\nCreate a new app, with very few dependencies, to sign TXs. This is already working in our CLI app and air-gapped signer.\nFreeze critical classes to prevent function over-write. \nRefactor storage, to only allow access from certain code parts.\nOther measures are been considered.\n\nthanks, mat\u00edas\n. JFYI,\nCopay v5.2.2 is already available on Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.copay&hl=en), iOs and all platforms.. @lassikin regarding 2),  in the just released 5.3.0 we will be using CSP to restrict network access to whitelisted sites (bitpay backend and a couple of affiliates). CSP should be a secure method to prevent network access to all JS code in the app,  do you have any commment on that?  thanks.. 6) we will be also locking package-lock during each major version. We will only update security patches, but any update will only happen when a new major version is released.\n. We are checking them now, and also restricting network access from the app. thanks.. I don't think that is possible.\nI sugest you move you coins to a new bitcoin-cli wallet.. Hi,\nIn order to help you with this issue, we will need to check the affected addresses in particular.\n Could you please contact us directly:  support@bitpay.com?\nthanks!\nmat\u00edas\n. LGTM. Hi, atm, only account 0 if supported. We plan to support bip44 accounts in\nthe near future, but it wont work now.\nOn Fri, Dec 21, 2018, 2:09 PM BGalliotti <notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAssigned #9371 https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/9371 to @matiu\nhttps://github.com/matiu.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/9371#event-2041264505, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAGCHNKzryefaxNerLcIvbobuSGBU6_Cks5u7RXJgaJpZM4Y54oH\n.\n.

Hi, the address 19Sp4BjW3p6Dsmgg6wZzcpjPf74UDGymm is not associated with any address hosted by Bitpay Wallets/  Copay. Can you share your wallet id?. externalServices is only for  Bitpay's integrations. You should not need it for building copay. Let us know any problem.. @ryanxcharles Right. Master seems adequate here.\n. will add a comment regarding that.\n. no sure about that, I much prefer descriptive names for variables. Maybe requiredCosigners/totalCosigners are not accurate enoght but i would rather\nprefer to change to better names than to N/M.\n. Yes. I think the whole wallet will be on a closure. No sure how we will export the keys, thought, but it should be possible. @colkito is the one that notice that, and he has experience with this because of his work at simplelogin.co.\n. right. will fix that.   \n\n//sort lexicographically, i.e. as strings, i.e. alphabetically\nthis is a standard? Or just a way to do it? I would prefer to keep cosignerWallets sorted, to avoid sorting each address generation, therefore, we could sort on lexicographically on the extended master public key. (which could lead that keys(n) will not be sorted by themselves).\n. no sure I understand the commend here. The extended master public key is stored on this, and this function just generate regular pubkeys (the index'th derivative) based on that one. isChange choose between m/0 and m/1 branch. The users of this module (wallet) wont have access to extended keys (nor  the chain code).\n. but why someone will need to derive keys outside the wallet module? That could lead to an out-of-sync wallet (addressIndex and changeAddressIndex outdated).\n. done\n. Maybe we should use here the (master) publickey alone, to not provide any hints on the extension bits.\n. not this line, right?\n. yes, we are including cryto-js for node already..but it we have it on\nbitcore... it will be better to\nchange it, will do.\nOn Thu, Apr 24, 2014 at 8:36 AM, Ryan X.

A peer could have sent a 'rejectedBy' message, but if his signature is in scriptSig, the later fact will have preference\nover the first one. scriptSig's contents is the authoritative entity regarding the transaction status.\nThis just a fact that can not be changed by Copay, e.g: In a 2-3 wallet a TXP could have 1 signature, and 2  rejections. Later, if the unspent outputs are still available, a peer could sign the TX and broadcast it.\nThe only workaround I thought about that is moving the funds to other address once a TX rejected, but the elegant way to do that is to send always 2, competing TX proposals at the sametime, and the peer reject the outgoing TXP by signing the TX sending the same inputs to an address in the same wallet. It is actually pretty cool :)  I will spawn a ticket for that, for later evaluation. (https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/1056)\n. thanks, I will update that in a next PR.

Love the new function and variable names! Thanks.. To match the rest of Copay's code, this would probably be either: getNetwork\nor getEnvironment and return { network: \"livenet\" }.\n. Probably lines 10 to 12 should be inside getAppIdentity. Could you explain this more? We cannot merge this to master, if this is a requirement.. I think it would be safer that when we upgrade a key, we ALWAYS use a new key for the upgraded data,\nas it is done for bitpayCardCredentials and setBitpayDebitCards.\nCould you change the new of the key of the upgraded value of bitpayAccounts ?. thanks!. IMO, this doesn't scale. We need a general parameter, like \"hideAlternativeAmount\". same as above.. This probably should not be on amount.js\nAmount should only ask for an amount + calculator. Could this logic be on an other view?. Should be: 'Error connecting to Coinbase'. Should be: 'Error connecting to Coinbase'. updated, thanks.. Maybe we should add + token to the debug message.. please add:\nif (!isIOS || !isAndroid) => exit/warn\nthen:\n+      platform: isIOS ? 'ios' :  'android' ,\n. For the record, this is temporary until:   https://github.com/bitpay/bitauth/pull/63   is merged.. OK. approx amount. typo. use ATTEMPT_LIMIT constant?. I think it will be better to remove this contant, just use 'pin' on the code.. use ATTEMPT_LOCK_OUT_TIME for  5*60. name should be something like:\nsetMethodSelector\nor\nconfigureMethodSelect\n. It dont follow how after transitioning to tab.pin, the new  (null) selectedMethod will be saved.\nAlso, disabling fingerprint should also ask for the fingerprint.. verifyByThirdPartyService. txDetails should not know about 3th party BC names.. should be 'verifyByThirdParties'. see comment above.. looking good!. \ud83d\udc4d \n. we need to separate the err from 404 and others errors.\n404 is a critical error: The TX is not at the explorer.\nother error (like network error) is not critical\n. We should separate the err here:\nif (err ... = 404) then return cb(null, { notFound: true})\nelse return(err).. get Reduced Amount By Fee\nor \ngetAmountLessFee. or getNetAmount. There is way to much code in tx-details. js regarding this feature. it should be only a couple of lines.. this loop should be inside the service.\n. The service api should be something like:\nthirdPartyExplorers.verify(tx, function(err, result) {\n   if (err) return ...;\n$scope.verifiedOK = result.ok;\n   $scope.verifiedNOK = result.nok;\n   $scope.verifiedNA = result.na;\n});. inside the service.\nPlease do not use params. Parameters are a function input.  It is a generic name. . please dont use params name  as a response.. why parameter serviceName here?. the service listing  suggest that adding a service is just adding a new item in the config, and it is not.. here there shoudl be all the info about the services:\nname,\nurl,\nparser: function(response) {\n  return normalizedJason;\n}\n. maybe a better name would be \"toFiat\". Maybe this function should be calculateAmount...\nif (useSendMax)  {\n  ...\n} else \n  return cb(null, amount);\nand on the result of the function use txFormatService.parseAmount. Block Explorers. maybe better to refacto and send coin ==null  or send  the whole tx. +1 . I think it would be better to have a fiunciton in walletService:\nfunction getProtocolHandler(wallet) {\n  if wallet.coin== 'bch' return 'bitcoincash';\n  if wallet.coin=='btc' return 'bitcoin';\n  \n}\nand pass that info to the view, and do not put 'bitcoincash' in any other place.. don't use val as a variable name. maybe isLocked. lockApp => maybe: isLocked ?. then, +    return this.storage.set('isLocked', isLocked);\n. getLockApp => . getLockStatus. reset => unlock. break in 2 functions:\n1.- showLocktimer\n2.- setLockRelease. reset should not receive any .params..      clearInterval(countDown);\nshould be called here.. if the user change \"userprofile\" variable, the will no be able to find his wallets, right?. can't we use a homedir() thing? if not, add this to the README or something. shouldn't the event 'did-finish-load' be the right timing to send 'open-url-event' ? Why the extra 1000 ms?. lets use something different than the tile to identify the window here. Maybe add some metadata or an extra attribute.. Can we test that Electron support >1MB data per app?. lets simplify this:\nif (!window.localStorage)\n  throw new Error('...');\nls = window.localStorage;. Shoiuld be \"Storage Key <> removed\" (not file). please rename processingData(v) to processValue(v);. there is no need to change BALANCE_CACHE to BALANCE.\nadd BALANCE_CACHE_OLD. should we add an id here?. why we need this?. lets not upgrade plugin ins unless there is a security issue.\nx-socialsharing // x-toast // qr-scanner. do we need this even we use CSP?. + inappbrowser. ack. ack. ack. ok. function name:\nsetOldConfig? . beautiful!. should return null or undefined?. add: \nBCHTEST: mg6PLV5yyUS6Gy55fJ7f994dQ7RpfJNYC9. add\nbitcoincash: CHUwf57Maceqk5jhMX6NJkuLEbHEfqqgwx. maybe it would be easy to defined the test vectors:\ntestVectors:\n[\n[,,],\n[,,],\n...\n];\nand then iterate\ntestVectors.forEach( (v)=> {\nexpect(addressProvider.getNetwork(v[0])).toEqual(v[2]);\nexpect(addressProvider.getCoin(v[0])).toEqual(v[1]);\n});. it is difficult to understand the function like it is written:\nin extractAddress(address) is not obvious what is happending. Why extracting an address from something that is already address?. maybe removePrefix?. see above regarding this fn name. isValid's argument's name should be 'str' or similar. not address, to avoid confusion.\n.

After @ryanxcharles checks it, we should talk about the need of an external audit. I'm honestly not comfortable with launching on livenet without an external security audit.

Here's an interesting logdump of what happens when you create a new address:\n\nThere seems to be many unwanted repetitions there. \n. check address generation: exchange of pubkeyring is not efficient \n. We should evaluate how to fix it (if reducing number of pbkdf2 iterations, by making it asyncronous, or just putting a \"loading\" sign), but current behavior is not acceptable IMO\n. Progressive ciphering is the right way to do it I think: \nhttps://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#Progressive_Ciphering\n. I think with current implementation of pbkdf2 not even a spinner will work, because it's synchronous, and it locks the tab. (i.e. the spinner won't show or animate). Maybe we can modify CryptoJS to make it async (I did that for hasing in proofofexistence.com)\n. I think the problems is the sjclParams part. Just changed it back to 1000 and it works\n. Hey, I think we should really stop adding new features for now. There's lot of optimization/polishing UI/design fixes to be done. If we keep adding new features we'll make polishing more difficult. Just my opinion though\n. will look into this \n. Can you give me more info on when this happened to you? I'm profiling copay and getting good results:\nWhen joining a wallet and connecting to peers:\n91.53% (idle)\n1.82% (program)\n1.24% bitcore.js:10196 divide\n0.48% (garbage collector)\nwhen generating two address in a row:\n77.25% (idle)\n4.75% bitcore.js:10196 divide\n3.35% (program)\n1.86% bitcore.js:1170 bnMultiply\n. I have 14 addresses in the wallet, one of which has a positive balance. I don't think having a balance in all addresses changes anything, as the query to insight is needed anyway, but I'll try that\n. @ryanxcharles can you try this again and post a profiler screenshot if it's still a problem? insight API access has been optimized a lot since the creation of this issue. \n. This issue is about doing this via our own UI (right click on the video is not intuitive). Moving to Not for Launch \n. Awesome!\n. Agreed :)\n. IIUC, we're only showing the ntxid, which is not useful for looking up the tx on most block explorers.\n. haha, sorry then! maybe I didn't update my master. I'll check it now \n. Just found it. I'd like to make 2 quick fixes:\n- links are always to live.insight.is. they should be to test if in testnet\n- show the txid to the user\n. Seems like you weren't able to connect to bitcore's github repo. Could you try again? if it fails, maybe it's that the git:* dependency only works for project collaborators, and we may need to switch to https:*. Let us know!\n. @tomholub for now, try going to node_modules/bitcore/browser, and running\nsh concat.sh\nWe'll need to polish the install process. We're too early in development to do this right now\n. Yes\n. Notifications that change the page layout are not good. Maybe we should explore something like http://goodybag.github.io/bootstrap-notify/ in the future.\nAnother comment on this: we should not expect the user copy-pasting from the notification, at least not as the normal use case... sounds like bad UI to me (I'm fine with this PR though). Let's think about other ways of doing that: maybe after transaction is sent, we can highlight the txid from the transaction proposal view\n.

We discussed it when creating the new BIP, and it's part of the reason we implemented a branch for each copayer. I've discussed this with Yemel and decided not to show other copayer's addresses unless they have a balance. Let me explain:\nThe idea of using a separate branch for each copayer is to prevent \"race conditions\" when receiving payments. If each copayer creates addresses in the same branch, they could give the payer the same address, and when receiving a payment, they could confuse who was the one that paid. If we generate different address for each copayer, and not show the addresses until they have balance on the other's wallet, there's no chance that two different payers pay to the same address by accident. \nFor a more detailed explanation see: https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg05156.html\n. you create your own address if you want to fund it :)\n.

I don't know who suggested this, but off the top of my head I can think:\n- autocomplete send form when you type an address book contact\n- allow to add a master public key as a contact (so you can generate multiple addresses), maybe?\n. The drawback of having address books is that we 'encourage' people to reuse\naddresses, unless we do it with master public keys only.\nOn Thu, Jul 31, 2014 at 9:38 AM, Yemel Jardi notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI would like to separate it into it's own section. When you create a\nspending proposal, you will be asked to add the address to the address book.\nI would change the name from address book to contact book. A contact\nmay have many addresses related to him and eventually a master public key\nas Manuel says.\nAt the moment, the address book also work as \"Labels\" for the wallet\naddresses. We need to separate this functionality a create a different flow\nto label wallet addresses.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/979#issuecomment-50752323.\n. @cmgustavo did this right?\n.

And this should be the case unless you used Firefox in incognito mode or manually deleted the browser's local storage. \nAgain, please tell me your Firefox version.\nOn Sat, Aug 2, 2014 at 10:35 AM, maxwcoleman notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nTo summarize all important events as accurately as I can remember, assisted with timestamps of recorded events. It's messy, but if you read through it, I think there are some valuable clues:\n1. Yesterday, at 3:26pm, I tried creating a wallet by downloading the chrome extension. I was prompted to pay for WinZip, so I pressed cancel. I never opened any wallet. I have a record of the download in my temp folder.\n2. A few minutes later, around 3:30-3:31 (based on our gchat conversation) my partner and I made wallets around the same time.  I was now using the web version, while he was using the chrome extension. We then shared secrets with each other around the same time. I used his secret, and it opened the wallet he created (WALLET 1). The other wallet I created was left alone (WALLET 2). It's important to note I had a record of 2 wallets \nThe one we are discussing is WALLET 1\n3. When I used his secret to create the wallet, I followed the instructions, and I  clicked \"open\" when I was prompted. It was around 3:46 by the time we were both logged in.\n_Before, I questioned if I had actually cancelled this download. This was not the case. The memory I had of cancelling was of WinZip, when first downloading the Firefox extension.  I now remember I did click open when first opening the wallet, because I have a distinct memory of a notepad file opening with a long string of numbers and letters.\n4. Later, when I had already closed the tab on my browser - I tried to log back in (around 4:58pm when I first messaged my partner asking how to get back in). When I went to the login screen, it gave me 2 options - the wallet I originally created, and the other that my partner created. I was not able to log into either one. There was no record of any backup file. This is important, because later on I was able to find the file to the first wallet I created (not this one we used) in my temp folder, create a copy on my desktop, and change the file to the right name. I was then able to log back into that wallet for the first time.\n5. I then tried downloading the firefox extension again to see if that would solve the problem, and then I tried the chrome extension when firefox didn't work. When I downloaded the firefox extension, I was prompted to pay for Winzip again. At that moment (5:02pm), I uninstalled WinZip This is important, because I now realize that I have a system restore point at that point\n6. After trying to download both extensions, my partner also sent me copies of his backup (5:47pm in my downloads) to see if that would work. At some point when trying to figure out how to log back in, I tried restarting Firefox and Chrome, then restarting my computer. \n7. At this point in time, I wasn't certain whether or not I pressed cancel or \"open.\" I then went on to try to create 2 new test wallets (TEST 1 + TEST 2) to confirm what would happen when I followed the instructions correctly, and clicked \"open\" as instructed. \nI ran into the same problem both times \nI created the wallet, clicked Backup, then clicked Open, and opened the wallet with no problem. But whenever I logged out and close the notepad file, I was unable to log in again - there was no record of the file.\nThis is important because it confirms that I did, in fact, open the file. The problem was that it was not saved anywhere when I closed it. The same thing happens every time I create a CoPay wallet on my computer and click \"open\" when prompted\n8. I tried making another test wallet (TEST 3) where I selected \"save as\" instead of the default \"open\" - in this case I was able to log back in. \n9. When I search my computer for any files with \"keybackup.json.aes\" I find 3 files. One is one of the files that my partner sent me when I tried to use his backup. The second is a 1.48kb file named \"backup service\" - I later confused this with another file. It seems this file was part of the chrome extension download. When I tried to open it, I got the error \"angular undefined.\" The third is the file in my downloads from the test wallet when I clicked \"save as\" (TEST 3)\n10. I searched my temp folder for all files with \"aes\" - I found 3 files of note. \nOne was the chrome extension file from 3:26pm\nOne was a notepad file for the wallet I originally created myself at 3:44pm (WALLET 2). \nThe other was a notepad file for one of the test wallets at 8:12pm(Either TEST 1 or TEST 2, not sure - again, if you read through the series of events, I originally confused this file to be the file for TEST 3. That was a mistake).\n_When I made a copy of the file for WALLET 2 onto my desktop, and renamed it \"backup_recovery-keybackup.json.aes\" I was then able to log into that wallet for the first time - It just said waiting on third party. This was just a few hours ago.\nThis also means that one of the TEST files, as well as the file for WALLET 1 was missing from my temp folder by this point. Is there a chance they were overwritten?\nThis makes me wonder - if I go back to my 5:02 restore point, is there a chance that the notepad file I need will be in my temp folder? And if I change the file name to \"backup_recovery-keybackup.json.aes\" and then try to import it - should it work?\nLet me know if I can give any more details. I will update this if I think of or find anything else.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/1012#issuecomment-50962950\n.

(maybe paypro requires the tx to be broacst by the merchant?)\n- I don't like what you did with the G object. Try writing a small module for $http replacement instead of writing to globals.\n- Good work with tests\n\nOther than that: In general, great work! I agree with how you did it, except in some small things (which you have marked in code with XXX, so you are aware).\n.

Let me remove soop and I think we'll be able to solve this\n. to clarify: my build was working because I had the bitcore bower version symlinked to my bitcore repo.\nTo fix your build for now, try checking out latest bitcore and run:\nin bitcore repo:\nbower link\nin copay repo:\nbower link bitcore\n. sorry for the spam, but:\nDon't forget to run grunt shell --target=dev in bitcore!\n. fix this please!\n. nice work with this!\n. Please remove this. I removed it in a recent PR\n. Please leave the var copay = copay || require('../copay'); version, which now works without soop\n. That's just how I created the API in insight's mailbox pluguin. In node you CAN get microsecond precision, so I guessed we should support it :)\n. That's not a problem, because the default will take the contents of config.js, which point to the insight servers.\n. Copay uses WebStorage to save wallet data.\n. I don't think typeof can return 'PublicKeyRing'.\nI think the equivalent way would be: \npreconditions.checkArgument(!(data instanceof PublicKeyRing), 'bad data format: Did you use .toObj()?');\n. nice!\n. I like that idea. Will do\n. did you add underscore.js? what is _?\n. I didn't change those lines, really. Can we change it in another PR? :3\n. Instead of failing it should import the wallet without the tx proposals!\n. what beautifyer are you using? This alignment doesn't appear when I run my own. We should all use the same one!\n. I'm not sure this is correct... the socket should be disconnected when you run this code.\nIn any case, are you sure you need to resubscribe? I remember testing it manually and I think after automatic reconnection by socket.io, all messages still worked\n. shouldn't forceOpts be required instead of optional?\nI'd change this line to \n\npreconditions.checkArgument(forceOpts);\nFor security reasons. I may be wrong though, just asking\n. why are you adding this new message without adding a handler for it? I don't think we should send a message to reject a connection. we just close it. I agree with the other changes :+1:\n. use correct logging please :)\n. Please remove this commented code\n. lol... this is so wrong in so many ways: http//localhost:30001 read it carefully:\n- default should be insight.bitpay.com\n- it's not a valid URI: lacking : before //\n- port 30001????\n  Wil fix\n. fix this please\n. two questions here: \n- shouldn't plugin config be in separate files? (the idea is that people can chose not to have/configure some plugins right?)\n- GoogleDrive.clientId is the same for all copay users? this should only be changed when deploying a custom instance of copay right?\n. I think @eordano created a logging system for copay, we shouldn't be using custom logging. \n. nice!\n. typo: unknown\n. interesting...\n. great idea! \n. shouldn't this be isMobile.Opera()?\n. we should only disable the button in browsers that don't work\n. is this fix for mobile apps or mobile browser version?\n. We need to get back to using JSHint. It detects this kinds of simple errors early.\nSee: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5893447/28802\n. ",

It's very concerning if an app with 2800+ commits and 26 releases has input selection issues, which certainly must be the most important part of crafting transactions. Where in the code should I look for this?\n. Bump. Anyone interested in trying to find the cause of this? Problems with input selection/estimation, it would seem.\n. I no longer have the proposal in my Copay. Perhaps it could be tested with sending 100 BTC from a test network?\n. I'll update as soon as I have time. I'm still a little concerned with these math problems in copay/bitcore. Are you guys using javascript's Number class? That could be very dangerous:\n\nYou need to store everything strings and use a big integer class. See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proper_Money_Handling_(JSON-RPC)\n. I also propose that an assertion is added to copay or bitcore to disallow any tx that would pay more than X in miner's fee due to improper number handling. 0.1 BTC could be a good safe guard.\n.

I've solved the issue.\nI have several m-of-n wallets with the same m, n, and signers. The account numbers I use are different for each wallet so that the xpubs do not collide. After reinstalling Copay, the order in which you import these shared wallets appears matter. In my first attempt, the incorrect wallet was imported. I assume this is a bug with either Copay, BWS or both.\n. Assuming there will be more forks (SW2MB, SW1MB, SW2MB-Schnorr, SW2MB-NoSchorr, SW1MB-Schnorr, SW1MB-NoSchnorr, possibly all the way to SW2MB-NoSchnorr-NoMAST, etc) I think it's better just to make the setting network-specific today.

Closed by https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/971\n. Here is a discussion about this issue: https://github.com/peers/peerjs/issues/116\nIf the connection is lost or page is refresh without a graceful disconnection, the ID will be invalid for the next one or two hours.\nHere are a two ideas:\n1. Make sure to have a graceful disconnection whenever is possible. This is always desirable, but won't solve the problem of a sudden disconnection.\n2. Offer a fallback ID, appending an extra number to the ConnectionID. This solution is more complex and makes the copayers lookup/connection process take longer (increases linearly based on the numbers of retries).\nI think the first option is the way to go, and after that we can reevaluate if further development is needed.\nAny ideas?

If I understand correctly, you are making more efficient the generation of the RedeemScriptMap. How ever for doing that you are braking the building pattern (chaining the methods).

Moving between wallets it's problematic as well.\nWe are taking this feedback as input for the next design iteration.\n. Regarding decentralization, the difference between STOMP and PeerJS is the\nlast one SOME TIMES doesn't need to rely messages throw a server.\nHowever they both need a central server: PeerJS needs all copayers to use\nthe same broker, STOMP as well. As an alternative we allow copayers to run\nand use their own PeerJS, the same applies to STOMP (standard protocol with\nmany implementations).\nReplacing webRTC reduces value to some users of Copay, in particular to\nthose who can connect directly between peers without the use of TURN. On\nthe other side, STOMP adds value because it's a more mature technology and\nmore easy to integrate in other contexts besides the browser.\nJust as a comment: AFAIK webRTC won't be implemented by IOS any time soon.\nLet's have a call about this.\nOn Fri, Jul 18, 2014 at 8:47 PM, Ryan X. Charles notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWe should be more precise when talking about centralization and\ndecentralization.\nCopay is decentralized if, in an M-of-N wallet, M or more people have to\nbe compromised for the group to lose or have dimished access to their funds.\nYour proposal is to make Copay more reliant on central servers, not less.\nIt is a step in the wrong direction. If the central servers are\ncompromised, Copay ceases being useful. Your money is, at best,\ninaccessible if that happens. But there is no technical reason to have such\na limitation. If we make Copay properly p2p, then it can be robust against\nattacks on your copayers or any third parties.\nEven if the user does not have access to Copay, a programmer with access\nof the source code could recover the funds of the wallet having its backup.\nTrue, but it would be extremely difficult unless that programmer was one\nof us, who understand Copay in detail. The cost of recovering such funds\nwould be higher than the funds a lot of people put in Copay.\nAll of the features we want, like support for Safari and IE and\nasynchronous transaction proposals, can be done in a decentralized way, and\nwhile eliminating the PeerJS central point of failure. There is no\ncompelling reason to do anything less than that.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/913#issuecomment-49492084.\n.

Please go to Settings/About phone/Android version.\n. Today we are releasing a new build with a minor API level restriction, please try to install it again tomorrow (version 0.4.1), hopefully we will be supporting your device this time.\n. Awesome! Closing this\n. No, that's not an option any more. I'll update the issue with a clarification.\n. Other argument it's using the a 2-of-2 by the same person in two different devices (eg. phone + pc). If I create an address from my phone I would like to see it from my PC.\nWe still are avoiding change-address race conditions and with a \"creator\" label should be enough to avoid unintended reuse.\n. Sure, before the separation of branches we had 2 shared indexes, one for \"receive\" addresses and other for \"change\" addresses.\nBased on the asynchronous nature of Copay, we had 2 race conditions:\n1) A copayer generates a new address to receive founds and share it with a third party. If other copayer does the same without syncing the shared index, he will generate the same address. After separating branches, every time a copayer generates an address, he can be 100% no body else will generate it.\n2) A copayer creates a transaction proposal, generating a change address for it. If other copayer creates other transaction proposal without syncing the share index, he will use the same change address. After separating branches, there is no way 2 copayers generates a transaction proposal with the same change address. \n. @maraoz it's working on OS X, Are you using Crosswalk 8? launch_path was replaced by start_url on newer versions of Crosswalk.\nbtw, could you remove lines 61 and 62 (pwd; echo $APPDIR)?\n.

At the moment the set up of Crosswalk+Cordova it's a PITA.\n. Related #915, #914 \n. +1\n. That's a good point, to support this we need to shrink down the backup size by only storing the private extended key and the public extended keys of the other copayers. All other information can be inferred or synced from other peers.\nWe will be missing (until peer synchronisation):\n- Transaction proposals\n- Address book\n. After talking with @maraoz, we resolved this is not a good idea. Copay needs to backup more that just one extended private key, and that amount of information is not suitable for a QR code.\nAlternative backup options will be reviews on the future.\n. I'm seeing a problem here, how do you know where the user wants to store the wallet?\nIt can be either a browser extension, a desktop version, the mobile app, etc. Moreover a Copayer should be able to run their own web version (insight server) and still compatible with this sharing scheme. The URL idea seams too centralised to me.\n. This is a behaviour to include in the new design @bechi \n. Closed by https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/969\n.

A good standard way to handle imports it's to group them in the following order:\n1. standard library imports\n2. related third party imports\n3. local application/library specific imports\n. preconditions can be chained, e.g.\n\npreconditions.checkArgument(wallet)\n    .checkArgument(wallet.getId)\n    .checkArgument(X)\n    .checkArgument(Y);\n. hasProfile is a better name and it should return true or false. If that is not enough, it should be called listProfiles and should return a list for all profiles.\n. I don't like that pluginManager. I checked the code and you are using it only to get the initial parameters for creating a Storage instance.\nThe Identity class shouldn't know which implementation of Storage it's using, it should only receive an already configured instances of the Storage Service on it's constructor.\n. Same here, we need to stop sending config parameter all around. Thats what objects are for, to encapsulate state and config. We are also walking a dangerous path between transporting config options through constructors and accessing a global config variable \nWe should be passing instances, clases and/or factories on the constructors, and only the relevant config for THAT object.\n. A Profile may store additional public and private data from the user, e.g. Full Name or Avatar. I would like to be able to set that extra info while creating a new Identity.\n. Why this method is called bindProfile but no one of it's arguments it's actually a profile?\n. Creating a wallet by default it's not responsibility of the Identity class. That is a feature of the Copay Wallet not a feature of copay core.\nNotice you had to hardcode the wallet name here. You are not missing a parameter at the constructor, the problem is this code shouldn't be here since the beginning.\nOther thing that makes me noise about the wallet creation is the signature of the following static method:\nIdentity.create(...., function onResult(err, iden, firstWallet) {\n...\n});\n. I'm testing this and the Identity.create method is blocking (synchronously) ! It's taking to long because of the new Identity(...) call. Make it async. \n. Again, having a first wallet is not responsibility of the copay library\n. Why do you need to send all this options for opening a wallet? walletDefaults ?? networkName???!\n. What is that a param??\n. what are those opts and cb params for?\n. This is duplicated: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/config.js#L16\nUse the config values!\n.

This is awesome: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/4942 \u2013 I think we need to take it a little further to make it intuitive.\nI really like simplifying all notifications into a global setting \u2013 right now it's pretty unintuitive that push notifications are global to the device, and email notifications need to be updated wallet-by-wallet.\nIt would really simplify the mental model for notifications if all \"email notification\" and \"push notification\" settings were part of global \"Notification settings\". If it's valuable at all (email filtering/labeling options are very powerful these days), I'd say the manual, per-wallet email address setup is just a kludgy way to get individualized hooks: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3458. I think we should remove it from wallet settings entirely, and move it all up to Notifications.\nThis also clears the way for us to provide much more individualized/powerful notification management options.\nSlack, Github, Facebook for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n. Huh, I never realized that. Looks like Gravatar requires converting to lowercase for the hash, so we're still doing it right in the gravatar directive \u2013 though we should probably also insure whitespace is trimmed. (Even if we trim it before saving to storage.)\nIf possible, I still think the text field should default to beginning entry with a lowercase letter (on iOS, where it currently capitalizes the first letter if the user doesn't deactivate the shift key). But good to know \u2013 the solution to this issue should not force all characters to be lowercase.\n. Merging into https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4835\n. fixed\n. @matiu \u2013 oh, didn't realize that. How do you do that? The user manually sends money from the wallet to an address copied from the receive tab?\n. Not a bug \u2013 moving to: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4937\n. fixed\n. A few things \u2013 I think generally we can expect that users who \"get\" the interface enough to have multiple wallets will be able to understand the \"tab paradigm\". Nothing you do on one tab should effect the current navigational state of other tabs. (If I navigate somewhere in Settings, tap the home tab, and navigate into a wallet, tapping the Settings tab once should show me exactly what I was seeing before.)\nOn hiding tabs \u2013 the tabs are the \"cornerstone\" of the UI, they are the one familiar element in the app, and a big part of their function is to keep users feeling like they \"know where they are\". Whenever we hide the tabs, we break that context for the user.\nThe tabs should always be visible unless the user is in a \"modal\" view. Apple's guidelines for modality are still the gold standard here IMO. The only time when it's acceptable to \"steal the user's tabs from them\" (and that's how we should think about it \ud83d\ude06 ) is when they absolutely must take an action or complete a flow. For us, I think that's onboarding, backup, and payment flows.\nAs for the core issue, I definitely agree this could be jarring (especially for users coming from the less-native experience of the old UI). I think the real issue may actually be with the Receive view \u2013 it may not be immediately clear (especially for new users) that the QR code displayed is associated with the wallet name at the bottom of the view. \nThere are probably some design changes we should make to reduce the prominence of the address itself, and make the wallet card more prominent instead.\nI think we can actually merge this into: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4891\n. We should pick this up after #4916 is merged.\n. @gabrielbazan7 \u2013 icon for this (based on the import icon):\nicon-import.svg\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\"\n     viewBox=\"0 0 24.4 23.9\" style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 24.4 23.9;\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    .st0{fill:none;stroke:#000000;}\n</style>\n<path class=\"st0\" d=\"M2.2,15.9v3c0,1.7,1.3,3,3,3h14c1.7,0,3-1.3,3-3v-3\"/>\n<path class=\"st0\" d=\"M12.2,1.9v15\"/>\n<polyline class=\"st0\" points=\"6.2,10.9 12.2,16.9 18.2,10.9 \"/>\n</svg>. @jamal-jackson \u2013 mind taking a swing at this?\n. The checkbox svgs also need to be polished (let me know when you're working on it, I clean them up).\n. The outline of the checkbox svg is slightly off:\n\n. merging here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4904\n. Waiting on https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4890\n. I think you would only need to see the wallets for networks where you have more than one. That's probably a good solution for now at least.\n(In the future we should rethink the design of this screen a bit though. Surely there's a more intuitive way of doing this.). Yep, :+1:. Maybe there's a more descriptive term for that item anyways? Need to review it, but the screenshot at #4907 seems to imply that it's a (very) separate event from the last \"Accepted\"? Any idea why that would be?\n. Merging here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4907\n. This is working as it was originally designed, but I'm marking it as a bug, since it's unexpected and potentially scary.\n. As of https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5077, we have a Developer Utilities section in Advanced Settings \u2013 that would be the perfect place for this to be implemented initially.\nWe can add a Demo Onboarding item, with a Start button.\nWhen the onboarding process creates a wallet, it should create a new wallet called Onboarding Demo, Onboarding Demo 2, etc. If the user doesn't back it up, they'll see the \"needs backup\" warnings for it (throughout the app) when they finish the demo. The user can manually delete the wallet if they don't want to keep it.\nIf the app is restarted, it should return to normal (this option shouldn't store any state that brings the user back to onboarding after a restart \u2013 in-memory demo only).\n. I think this is probably the highest priority feature to (re)implement. Particularly with a lot of users trying out the new UI with \"throwaway\" wallets. \nThe current send flow is really focused on the quick \"send money to a someone\" use case. The sequential steps seem to work really well for that, but the flow sometimes falls short when the user has wallets with both personal and non-personal funds. These users tend to be uncomfortable with providing an amount before selecting a funding source, especially with large amounts (because they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll accidentally send it from the wrong wallet).\nSo I\u2019m thinking this could be handled well with two fairly minor changes:\n1. Implement a wallet selector on the keypad view\nThis solves a lot of initial user confusion and allows for the keypad to be responsive to the state of the selected wallet. Something like this (slightly dated) mock:\n\nWhen the user taps the wallet name, we show the wallet selection menu (also used in the confirmation view) with available balances visible.\n2. Cap the amount at the selected wallet\u2019s max\nSo if the user presses 9 a few times, the amount will eventually \u201csnap\u201d to the maximum amount the selected wallet can send. After the amount maxes out, if the user taps a number again, a subtle Insufficient funds message should fade in and out (animate over ~4 seconds). If the user has other wallets (so the wallet selector is visible), the selector should also shake horizontally (~1 second animation) to make it clear that it's a tappable control.\nAside: we'll want to reuse this dynamic to inform users about any maximums and limits on the exchange and card integrations. (Which can be annoying to find out about after getting to the confirmation screen.)\nAs an added benefit, the confirm view no longer has an action the user must perform in the send flow, so it feels a little simpler to handle. Payment requests start on the confirm view, so the source wallet will still be commonly changed there, it will just feel like it's \"already done\" when the user lands on confirmation at the end of the send flow.\n. An additional idea (probably outside the scope of this feature request, but wanted to get it down) \u2013 we might also want to add a \"Transfer wallet balance\" view in the wallet settings.\nThe primary purpose of a Send Max button is to \"retire\" a wallet. There's no better place to do that then close to the \"Delete Wallet\" (or hopefully in the future, \"Archive Wallet\") button. This also gives us a lot more UI room to really explain what's happening \u2013 particularly (if applicable) why it's \"send max\" and not \"send all\".\n. @vanhue when you get a chance, could you post the new mocks here?\n. Link is updated now \ud83d\ude80 \n. I think the issue here is that the element containing the Click to accept button (only appears on \"no-touch\" platforms) should be fixed at the bottom of the view (like the slide to accept component is on touch-enabled).\n. Definitely. I think we have some ideas for how to implement this into the receive view very cleanly. We'll get some mocks posted on this issue.\n. The changes in #5020 will make this easier to do without sacrificing simplicity.\n. This should also provide us with specific control over the location of our \"data directory\": https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4988.\n. The addresses primary purpose on this view is just to help the user understand what QR code they're looking at, so I'm not sure if we want to increase it's prominence at all (maybe increase the size and decrease the contrast).\nI definitely agree that we should be using the standard font-size for the platform on this view. (Looking particularly at the wallet name and balance \u2013 definitely unnecessarily small.) I'll take this issue.\nRelated: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4836\n. Issues here:\n- Font sizes are generally too small \u2013 we should be using device-standard sizes\n- On first-impression, It's not immediately obvious that I'm looking at my \"Spending\" wallet\nThe hierarchy of importance here is probably:\n1. \"this is a bitcoin address\"\n2. \"this is the address for my 'Spending' wallet\"\n3. \"other people can scan this\"\n4. \"I can send it with the share button\"\n. merging into #5020\n. (Closing in favor of that issue)\n. Hey @drejkir \u2013 thanks for the report!\nIt looks like your transaction has not been confirmed yet by the bitcoin network: https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/12ef22dc1df214dfc49036340580f0d4a068cb8aa7413d65b569f581d505c531. Once it's confirmed, it will be available to spend from your wallet.\nWe're aware that this is not as clear as it could be in the user interface \u2013 you can watch development for the issue here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4881.\n(I'll close this individual issue since we're already working on it there.)\n. From @matiu here:\n\nOptions should be something like:\n- Every day wallet  (For every day expenses, holding small amount of bitcoins) 1 of 1\n- Saving wallet (for holding larger amount of Bitcoins, multisignature) 2 of 2\n- Enterprise wallet (for shared ownership of funds, multisignature) 2 of 3\n- Custom\nIf the user choose one of the templates, we can store that info on the wallet, and better guide the use later in:\n- the backup process (eg: you need to backup your 2 devices for 2-2 wallets)\n- the signing process (eg: please now sign this transaction in your other device, no email notifications, etc)\n- the wallet delete process\n. On this: the device names sent also need polishing\n\nTypo here: \"Unknow Device\" \u2013  https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/ab1191695b2813181a146583e222e5cc657bcfea/src/js/services/bitpayCardService.js#L139\nAnd I getting values like iPhone8,1 for my iPhone 6s, and darwin for the app paired on macOS. It would be great if we could at least reliably report the most popular iOS and Android devices, and narrow down the desktop builds to Mac Windows and Linux.\nI think this would be a valuable place to abstract the \"device name\" stuff into a smaller, reusable service.\n. This also needs to be fixed in the email template:\n\nNo need to see the BitAuth ID, only the reported device name.\n. This is looking great in master now:\n\nAnd I don't think we need to force the modal out every 24 hours, the warning bar already makes the issue very obvious. So I'm going to call this finished \ud83d\ude80 \n. Ah \u2013 that's a great point. Same would be true of \"watch-only\" wallets that are able to create proposals but not sign them.\nMaybe we should only merge the items if they happened at the same time, on the same device? The really redundant part (to the point that some users are reporting it as a bug) is the duplicated name and time for both items.\n. With that latest PR, this doesn't look like a bug anymore, but it could still be better designed.\n. From https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4878#issuecomment-256537992:\n\nMaybe there's a more descriptive term for \"Broadcasted\"? Need to review it, but the screenshot at #4907 seems to imply that it's a (very) separate event from the last \"Accepted\"? Any idea why that would be?\n. From @ajp8164:\n\"Accepted\" (I think) means \"signed\" so maybe we should use \"Signed\".\nInstead of \"Broadcast\" what about \"Complete\".  \"Broadcast\" sort of implies that something comes next.  This being a timeline should have a resolved state.\nI think the whole timeline (names) should be re-looked at.  It's really a transaction timeline, right?\nIdeas:\n\"Timeline\" > \"Transaction Timeline\" ?(header)\n\"Proposal created\" > \"Created by Jason\"\n\"Accepted\" > \"Signed by Houston\"\n\"Rejected\" should be a final state (?)\n\"Broadcasted\" > \"Complete\"\n. @ruimarinho no, this means Copay will only be available for desktop via the native desktop apps for each platform (currently nw.js).. Hi @bnkprc \u2013 is there an issue happening in Copay that you weren't expecting? There's a fairly large backlog on the Bitcoin network right now, and the linked transaction hasn't confirmed yet. The funds should be available in your wallet after the transaction has confirmed.\n\nSince this seems like a network issue rather than a bug in Copay, I'll keep this issue closed for now. If you're noticing a bug in Copay, please provide a little more info, and we'll reopen.\n. Happening in #4890 \n. This is fantastic \ud83c\udf89 \nStill reviewing, but I haven't found any issues yet.\n. ACK from me!\n@matiu @cmgustavo \u2013 it would probably be good for you guys to review too, you'll know the edge cases to look for.\n. The BitPay and Copay apps are entirely separate, and will not interfere with each other's data storage. To access your bitcoin, you can continue using the latest release of Copay.\n. Closing this issue for now since it doesn't appear to be a bug, but please let me know if I need to reopen it. \ud83d\ude80 \n. No\n. Hey @axel2078 \u2013 this is actually possible already, in both the current version of Copay, and the recently released BitPay distribution.\nYou can import the full wallet into Copay, go to the wallet's settings, tap the \"Advanced\" or \"More Options\" item, and tap \"Export Wallet\". You can enable the \"Do not include private key\" option to export a watch-only copy of the wallet. Then delete the wallet, and import only the watch-only copy.\nHere are the relevant screens:\nLatest Copay\n\nLatest BitPay\n\n. Ah \u2013 I misunderstood. I thought you were interested in a full watch-only wallet. We currently don't have a way to watch just a single bitcoin address. Updating the issue.\n. Would be solved by: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4907\n. ACK\n. Thanks for coming to the issues here first!\nYep, the next release will include the changes that do away with that functionality. We'll find a better way to prep the camera in the future.. Just want to clarify \u2013 this was corrected in: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5440\nNew versions of the app should no longer be doing this \"testing\", instead we opted to have the camera start a little bit slower on desktop.. On this issue \u2013 push notifications should also distinguish between testnet and livenet payments. Just so messages from shared testnet wallets like A payment of 20 BTC has been sent from your wallet are a little less initially-terrifying \ud83d\ude06 \n. On fiat displays (to solve for @JulianTosh's use case too), maybe we could distinguish it similarly? Something like 1 testcoin, 10,000 test bits, or $1,000.00 test USD. So any display of test \"value\" clearly says test somewhere close by.\n. Not sure if I understand the goal here \u2013 is this for setting up to work on development of Copay?\nnpm start is a very unsafe way to use this project for real money. That opens the app in the system default browser, and could be compromised by nearly any browser extension, as well as any \"XSS vulnerabilities\" which may or may not exist. This project is not \u2013 and should not be used as \u2013 a web app. (If you're storing real money on a website, you're gonna have a bad time...)\nI think we want contributors to Copay using the very simple npm install && npm start method \u2013 it's already very stable and repeatable (not to mention the start:ios, start:android, etc scripts). I don't see a lot of value in complicating that with Docker.\n. @amitkumarj441 \u2013 definitely appreciate your interest in contributing to Copay.\n\nI think we want contributors to Copay using the very simple npm install && npm start method \u2013 it's already very stable and repeatable (not to mention the start:ios, start:android, etc scripts). I don't see a lot of value in complicating that with Docker.\n\nIs there a specific use case for why a developer shouldn't clone this repo normally to contribute to Copay? In order to share their changes, they'll still need to send a pull request. This just really doesn't seem like a place for Docker.\n. Closing for now, but please let me know if this should remain open.\n. @amitkumarj441 \u2013 please take a look at my responses and last question. Packaging Copay like this is at least confusing for new developers, and possibly a serious security problem.\n. Design ACK\nAwesome work! \ud83d\ude80 \n. @JDonadio I think this needs to be code reviewed \u2013 I love that we're simplifying notifications, but there seem to be a few small issues\n. This solves the immediate problem of the app making it seem like larger-than-intended payments are being made.\nFlow:\nInitial balances\n\n100,000 bits sent from one wallet to the other\n\nNew balances on home tab\n\nuser taps testnet wallet\n\nuser taps Savings wallet\n\nI think there are a lot of design improvements that could be made to help (particularly new bitcoin users) understand the concept of \"confirming\", though this fixes the immediate issue of frightening users in certain situations.\nNote: I intentionally did not make any changes to the Receive view \u2013 I assume that if the user is \"holding up a QR code\", they're not simultaneously trying to make a transaction from one of their wallets. If someone makes a payment to the QR code, the balance won't change until it's confirmed (to avoid misleading uninformed users into believing they have received the payment already).\n\n\nSo while the transaction above was going on, this view would still only show the confirmed balance, which seems like a balance drop. The user can flip back to their wallet to see more info though:\n\nAfter confirmation, the wallets views return to normal:\n\n\nI think this solves the immediate issue, but we should review this fundamentally. Hopefully we can eliminate the imprecise \"Use Unconfirmed Funds\" Advanced setting, and always intelligently differentiating between unconfirmed funds under the user's control, and unconfirmed funds that the user can't yet rely on. (@isocolsky has solid ideas on this)\n. Hey @Kirvx \u2013 thanks for the report! It's very possible the camera is staying activated longer than it should be.\nWith the new scanner, we've somewhat disconnected the UI the scanner itself to improve performance. The scanner first turns on when you open the scan view, but it remains functional (with scanning disabled) for 10 seconds after leaving the view. This makes it extremely quick to reactivate if you switch back to the scan tab.\nAfter that 10 seconds though, scanning should stop, and resource consumption should fall to nearly zero. (After a little longer, the scanner is also \"destroyed\" completely, and no longer consumes any resources.)\nIf the scanner is still clearly active on your device, it might be a bug with the native Android implementation. I'll test on some other Android devices and see if I can figure out the issue.\n. Good to know. I should have also mentioned that we attempt to pre-initialize the scanner right after the app starts to improve the initial load time a little more.\nSo that would also point to an issue with the android implementation of cordova-plugin-qrscanner.\n. ACK \u2013 much better \ud83d\udc4d \n. @jamal-jackson \u2013 could you also go through the app and replace this in the other locations we're using the other checkbox styling? Noticing it still needs to be updated inside the \"Terms of Use\" view. (Added you here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4869)\n\n. On desktop, the wallet cards also shouldn't be pushed to the edges of the screen. The perceived spacing between the cards shouldn't change between mobile and larger screens. As the view gets wider, more wallets can become visible, with the selected always one in the center.\nThe text in the card is also visibly blurred.\n\n. More generalized (from other discussions), users tend to be confused when rates are slightly different between devices. Right now this happens because each device fetches its own rate independently on an interval.\n@isocolsky mentioned the possibility of having BWS fetch rates regularly, and having devices sync the new rates at (nearly) the same time. Maybe on a (BWS-configurable?) one minute interval globally.\n. To consider further \u2013 The description for incoming/outgoing payments should describe \"from/to where\". For paid payment requests, let's use the same iconography as transactions in the debit card (I'm writing a BIP 70 extension).\n. For now, we can leave out the BIP 70 extension / merchant category stuff. We should get the rest of the design changes implemented and polished.\nFor the incoming/outgoing payments descriptions, lets use the name from the Address Book (if available, otherwise the truncated bitcoin address). The icon for those should use the associated gravatar. If the address book entry doesn't have an email (to fetch a gravatar) \u2013 we should fetch a gravatar \"identicon\" based on the hashed bitcoin address. (also needs to be updated in the address book views)\n. Related: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5068\n. Finished here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5007\n. Thanks for the PR @homeopatchy! @matiu do you want to review?\n. Maybe @cmgustavo can review this?\n. Awesome work \ud83d\udc4d \nDesign looks great, and it's working perfectly for me. Someone else might want to review code and ACK too.\n. ACK \u2013 this is great, thanks!\n. (Also opened a related issue: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4965)\n. I think a frameless, transparent Electron window + the Electron desktopCapturer would be very promising here.\n. Could we get some info on how best to manually test this? How can I modify my local storage to retry, etc? Looking great so far!\nOn first review, the 5/5 feedback flow dropped me right into the text entry screen, when it should have taken me to the Thank you / rate view. I still need to step through the other flows.\n. @cmgustavo could you provide a little more detail on this? Do you mean the privacy light on your laptop stays active? Or the video preview is still active? (Is this still an issue with the new scanner work?)\n. Right now it should stay \"enabled\" for 10 seconds after visiting the scan tab. Though if you scan something successfully, it should go off immediately.\nLooks like there are some strange edge cases where scanning won't be properly deactivated after scanning. Definitely needs to be reviewed \ud83d\udc4d \n. dup: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4831\n. Hi @themovement919 \u2013 if you'd like to dig into the issue, take a look at the NW.js project. The desktop versions of Copay use NW.js, so that would be the place to dig for info on where data is stored.\n. Reviewing NW.js should help you get something working immediately if you'd like. Otherwise, this will hopefully be a lot simpler with the migration to Electron.\nMerging this issue into that: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4890\n. Merging to here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4997\n. Hey @frz-dev \u2013 it sounds like the apply task either didn't run or didn't complete. If you're still unsure about the issue, could you copy/paste the contents of package.json here?\nroot cause is this somewhat-messy system: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4921\n. Hey @frz-dev \u2013 sorry, I just realized the issue. Documentation is a little outdated there.\nThere's actually not currently a \"best\" way of doing development inside the NW.js build \u2013 the choices are npm start (for simply developing in a browser) or npm build:desktop to test the final app. For day-to-day development, npm start is what you'll want. Since we do want to eventually get a start:desktop working cleanly, I'm just aliasing it to npm start for now in https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/4995.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Happening on these devices:\n- Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and use Cyanogenmod 11, Android 4.4.4\n- Z3c, Android 4.4.4\nSo maybe an issue on that Android version?\n. Also happening on Firefox here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4991\nImage mirrored for GitHub:\n\n. If this is due to inconsistent implementations of flexbox, we might need this: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4965\n. @unusualbob is able to reproduce on a Z3c device. \n. Maybe reproduced \u2013 I suspect that these devices are not handling the -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%) properly. Not been able to confirm on a real device yet. Even the Android stock browser is supposed to support this properly (caniuse reports full support with the -webkit- prefix).\n\n. Related:\n- https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4705\n- https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/2892\n. Also need to ensure disabled services are not visible in any views.\n. Fantastic work! (Still reviewing)\n. This is absolutely awesome!\nLast nit: the items below should say Receiving and Sending respectively. Confirming doesn't really mean much to most users.\n\n\n. ACK \ud83d\ude80 \n. @gabrielbazan7 please let me know when this is ready for me to review. (And how to best test every case.)\n. Reviewing today\n. Yep, your wallet contains many addresses, the Receive view only shows the most recent one. You can safely use any address from the wallet, and payments will still be added to your balance. \nWe have some plans to make this clearer in the interface \u2013 I'm going to merge this issue into that one. https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5020\n. Thanks @dabura667. Looks like this issue is solved, so I'm closing for now. Please let me know if I should reopen.. Related: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4889\n. Related: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4603\n. Yes, old addresses will continue to work \u2013 all of your wallet addresses are permanently stored (and backed up by your 12 word backup). \nHopefully this will be made clearer by https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5020. I'll merge this issue into that one now. \ud83d\ude80 \n. merging to that issue (#4997)\n. #4997\n. (What is NSF?)\n. Looks great now\n. I think this is superseded by @msalcala11's work on the ionic2 branch now. Closing, but let me know if I should reopen.. Things we talked about:\n\n\n. ACK\n. Thanks!\n. ACK\n. Thanks for submitting an issue @CrispyB \u2013 as @dabura667 mentioned, the best way to secure your wallet is to prevent potential thieves from getting access to your unlocked device. Particularly with iPhones, the best security is a phone-wide pin or password lock. The iPhone's hardware security is fairly solid as far as mobile devices go.\nFundamentally, even if Copay did provide an \"app-only\" pin or password, there are a variety of other ways attackers with physical access to your unlocked device might gain access to your bitcoin. (Regardless of security features that are possible to implement on an app level.)\nWe are working on a simple app pin/passcode lock in #4555, but it's absolutely critical to understand \u2013 only unsophisticated attacks will be prevented by this security feature (part of the reason it's not been a priority). It may prevent small thefts, but it will not keep your bitcoin safe.\nFor strong security, consider creating a \"shared wallet\" which requires multiple devices to sign transactions. This protects you both from simple thefts and from potentially-unknown vulnerabilities in any single device. More devices = more security. \ud83d\udd12 \nMerging this issue into #4555 for now, but please let me know if I should re-open.\n. ACK\n. \ud83d\ude80 \n. \ud83d\ude80 \n. I think this is almost ready \u2013 final two issues:\n- complete.html \u2013 A member of the team will review your feedback as soon as possible. is not displaying when the view shows for scores 1-3\n- Settings -> Share BitPay \u2013 the back button is not displaying\n. Hey @davidlatapie \u2013 this is an issue with NW.js: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5206. It's because NW.js is a fork of Chromium, which means your local copy of NW.js could be logged into Google. (Since we never log in, this is basically just dead code.)\nIt's annoying that we can't disable this by default, but we're already migrating to Electron in this pull request, so hopefully this will be an historical issue by the next release.\nI'm going to merge this issue into https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4890 for now, please let me know if I should re-open.\n. Definitely agree. Hopefully we'll be able to get switched over to Electron soon. \ud83d\ude80 \n. Hey @davidlatapie \u2013 thanks for adding the issue. You can rename wallets in the settings tab. Settings -> choose wallet -> Name. We might need to revisit the design for this, since it seems like that wasn't intuitive.\nRelated: #4952\n. @JDonadio for the icon, you can use www/img/tab-icons/ico-receive-selected.svg in the same way addressbook.html does:\n<i class=\"icon zero-state-icon\">\n        <img src=\"img/tab-icons/ico-receive-selected.svg\"/>\n      </i>\n. ACK\n. ACK, nice work!\n. Was this broken? Issue #4866 is about adding paper wallet scanning to the scan tab. (If this is different, we can get this merged in, and finish #4866 later.)\n. LGTM\n. ACK\n. Hi @Deepakhc \u2013 do you see any other information logged before this error? There might be something about a package missing?\nAlso, could you confirm you ran npm install before running npm start?. This is only when transitioning from a wallet detail view back to the home tab, correct?\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed in https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5086\n. ACK\n. @ajp8164 I think this issue is about providing a pre-populated email for recommending the wallet to new users? (Any thoughts on what the contents should include?). (Actually, I'll submit a PR that only moves the files, then we can merge this). https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5101. \ud83d\ude80 . @msalcala11 has it working on all platforms on the latest version of Ionic. So maybe if not now, we can get it implemented everywhere during/after a migration?. NACK \u2013 design-wise, we don't think this is the direction we want to go currently. It somewhat limits our options for extending the view with other kinds of data/activity. It's ok to leave experimental, but I'd rather not enable it now just to potentially disable/replace it in a few weeks.. Hi @agustinf, we'd love to review a pull request for a SURBTC integration! \nI do want to warn you \u2013 we're actively working on a major refactor upgrading the application to Ionic 2 and Angular 2: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/tree/ionic2. So there's a good chance anything developed in the next 1-2 months will need to be refactored. That being said, we plan to continue expanding our exchange integrations, and we'd love to work with you!. Awesome work!. Waiting on: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3406. These boxes are actually download links: \nThat's good to know though \u2013 maybe we can make it clearer somehow. I'll try right now.. I imagine people are ignoring the images because they look a little like advertisements. I duplicated the grid to the bottom and made some language clearer. hopefully that solves the issue for now (until we provide a simpler option for pre-selecting OS and sending people to the proper download from https://bitpay.com/wallet)\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/releases/tag/bitpay. I'm seeing it in both places on the version downloaded from the app store: \niPhone 6s (10,1), iOS 10.2\nAre you looking at a version built for development?. Thanks for opening an issue!\nJust to note \u2013 the same problem also occurs if someone gets access to the xprivkey, which must be available to the app anyways. So usually, deleting the words doesn't really provide anything past \"UI security.\" It only inconveniences attackers with device storage access, while significantly complicating recovery for casual users.\nIf we're primarily concerned about a thief getting access to the logged-in device (like if you let someone else use your phone) do you think something like https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4555 would solve this use case? (Already on the roadmap for a near-term release.)\n(As an aside, are you using a spending password for the wallet?). Examples from Uber and Lyft:\n\n\n. I'm not sure if I understand exactly what the goal here is \u2013 looking at the feedback coming in, we're really not getting that kind of feedback on this screen. E.g. users who don't really understand that the wallet itself doesn't sell bitcoin (and that Glidera is a separate thing) aren't really sending us feedback, they're going straight to the app store and giving us 1 star there.\nGenerally, we also don't want this to feel like a support ticket system in which the user needs to \"categorize their request\". We want simple, actionable, text-message like feedback, and we can manually triage.\nIf anything, I think we'll get more valuable feedback / redirect angry users to provide constructive feedback by directing them from the views where they're having trouble (mainly the integrations).\nMost urgent is probably the Glidera integration \u2013 when the user re-enters the app after being directed to Glidera, that would be a good place to clarify the app's relationship with Glidera, and provide a way for them to contact both us and Glidera directly for support.. Thanks for reporting @zacharytamas! It's working as designed, but I think it definitely needs review. (It's not uncommon for people to assume the camera quirks on desktop are due to malicious code.)\nI was actually working on improving this today as part of a solution to #4935 and #4967. Hopefully I'll have something ready to PR soon. If it's ok with you, I'm going to close this issue in favor of those.. Just to update this issue \u2013 this was fixed here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5440. Hey there \u2013 do you have any hints as to what the remaining word is? If the words were copied down in a hurry, you may be able to compare them against the full word list (I assume you're looking for the english one?)\nIf you have no hints as to the final word, depending on the value, it might be worth it to you to attempt to search all possible wallets by trying all 2048 options. I'm not aware of any programs which have been written to do that specifically, but you'll probably need the bitcore HD key documentation.. Ah \u2013 glad you found it! No need to delete the issue. Hopefully someone else will find the info above helpful.. Just to explain this further \u2013 we've gotten a lot of support requests where it seems like the slide action is not clear enough.\nMy recommendation is that we make the slider for all bitcoin payment requests read:\nSlide to pay ->\nFor sending bitcoin (without a payment request):\nSlide to send ->\nand for multisig proposals:\nSlide to accept ->\nBitPay card, buying/selling bitcoin, amazon card:\nSlide to complete ->\nIf those words don't fit on the slider (in whatever language the user has enabled) I think they need to be reduced in size to fit (or maybe drop to a second wrapped-line). It's more important to have the language visible.. I don't have a very strong opinion on it, but I think \"Slide to pay\" and \"Slide to send\" add additional clarity that's kind of lost on the more generic statements. . @matiu this PR is only for the \"privacy light\" (little green light by the camera), and there are currently no mobile devices with privacy lights. So I think this only concerns the desktop build.\nOn what you mentioned \u2013 would you expect the flash to work differently? If you tap the scan tab again, the flash button is still highlighted, right?\nI guess we could disable the light if the user navigated away, but I think it's probably a better experience for the light to only activate/deactivate when the user taps the button. If the user is in a dark room and activated the light to scan a printed QR code, I would think the light should stay on until the user deactivates it.. I'm still reviewing on mobile devices. These are small changes, but the logic is pretty complicated, so I'd like to be very sure it's completely correct now.. This is ready for review. It would be good to test a bit more on Android, particularly. . @cmgustavo \u2013 see above - I don't think that's a bug. \n\nI guess we could disable the light if the user navigated away, but I think it's probably a better experience for the light to only activate/deactivate when the user taps the button. If the user is in a dark room and activated the light to scan a printed QR code, I would think the light should stay on until the user deactivates it.\n\nWould you expect it to work differently? I tried a bit both ways, and it seems more intuitive like this? (I don't have a strong opinion on it though, I could switch it). Without a backup, the wallet is likely lost.\nIf it's worth it, your only chance is to try recovering the deleted data from the storage medium. You should stop using the disk immediately (it may have already been overwritten if you continued using the device), find a program that works on your operating system to recover deleted files from a storage device, and run the recovery tool. If you're (extremely) lucky, you may be able to find the app's storage in the \"empty\" space on the drive. If so, the \"profile\" key has a JSON object with an \"xprivkey\" field containing a private key you should be able to import back into the app (and sweep to a wallet which you have backed up).\nHope that helps!. I'm going to close this for now, but please let me know if you think it should be re-opened.. Glad to hear you were able to recover some files, hopefully you'll be able to extract your keys.\nI'm afraid I don't know of any such services \u2013 if you find one, please post here so people can find them in the future.\nAs for the design of the backup flow, I think this has been resolved in the BitPay app and in the upcoming update to the Copay app. The backup process is significantly clearer and easier to understand, and we've put a lot of time into making sure users understand the consequences of not backing up a bitcoin wallet. (There are also more visible ongoing reminders.). Your wallet has a nearly unlimited number of bitcoin addresses which are all generated from your backup phrase. You don't need to worry about keeping track of addresses, any payments made to any of the addresses in your wallet will show up in your balance. The wallet simply tries to use a new address each time to improve your privacy and security.\nYou may want to use the BitPay app, since it really makes these things clearer. (You can see all your addresses by choosing the wallet in the 'Receive' tab.)\nUntil the next release of Copay comes out, you'll have to open the wallets advanced settings, and check the \"more info\" view for a full list of your addresses.\nHope that helps \u2013 I'll close this for now, but please let me know if I should reopen.. The new scanning is leaps and bounds better, but we might want to consider the zoom feature to improve further: https://github.com/bitpay/cordova-plugin-qrscanner/issues/59. @cmgustavo: weird \u2013 thanks for noticing. Looking at that now.. To do:\n- reproduce and fix the issue with the bitcoin icon\n- update the amazon integration landing view to match the other integrations. \nSo this is very strange ^ \u2013 icon-bitcoin.svg is just not loading in the iOS webview. Working fine in safari and chrome on desktop.. @cmgustavo \u2013 fixed those issues, and also improved the design of the Amazon integration. Mind reviewing again?. Hey @fragiledream \u2013 sorry I just saw this. GitHub issues are primarily monitored by our development team, so sometime issues that haven't been tracked down to a software bug can fall through the cracks.\nWould you mind emailing us at support@bitpay.com? Our support team's average response time there is less than an hour, and even complex issues usually get solved in less than a day. I'll keep an eye out for your email, and we'll be sure to figure out what happened.\nThanks!. I'm going to close this issue here for now (it may be a backend or service provider issue too). I'll reopen it and post technical details if we determine there was a bug with the app.\nIf anyone else experiences a similar issue, please feel free to leave a comment here, and I'll reopen too.. @ajp8164 \u2013 I made a pull request starting on integrating app.scss into the rest of our scss, and replacing it with a variables-only overrides.scss: https://github.com/ajp8164/copay/pull/11\nGenerally we want to avoid having any scss files with more than 100-200 lines or so. Keeps the styles approachable and refactor-able, and ensures we don't grow tumors of brittle, tightly-coupled overrides.. Design ACK \u2013 awesome work!\nThere are a few small color/style things we'll probably polish up, but I think those would be better to do in smaller PRs.\nThanks for refactoring. Let's get this in a beta \ud83d\ude80 . Thanks for taking the time to send us feedback @Willstar44 and @astupidmoose! \nVery sorry you've not been happy with parts of the new design \u2013 we'll definitely be reviewing this feedback, and I hope we can break this issue into some actionable improvements.. > 1. So I click on the wallet in the home screen\n\n\nThen I click on \"Receive\" at the bottom\nIt shows me an address. But this is the address for a TOTALLY DIFFERENT WALLET.\n\n\nThat seems to be a common expectation from previous Copay users \u2013 we probably need to revisit the Receive tab to make that clearer. In user testing with new users, most users noticed the cards at the bottom of the receive tab, and didn't expect the tab system to be \"stateful\" (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc. mobile apps). Since Copay has done that for a while, it's definitely throwing off Copay users. \nThank you all for the excellent feedback. We definitely see multi-wallet as the future direction for the app (lowering the barrier to using many wallets fluidly), so we'd like to avoid re-introducing the concept of a \"current\" wallet. But we will definitely look into how we can make the Receive view more intuitive. (Would love to hear ideas from anyone interested!). @toomim would you be interested in seeing the mocks/beta for improvements to the Receive tab? It sounds like you'd be able to give us some really valuable feedback.. If anyone else reading this issue would be interested in providing feedback on future designs for the Receive tab, please shoot us an email at feedback@bitpay.com, we'd love to work with you.. Awesome \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @wzup \u2013 you can find Apple's official product images and licensing info here: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#images\nHope that helps!. @mike1968mi Bitcoin wallets provide the possibility for you to completely control your money and avoid losses from companies going bankrupt or getting hacked. We have no plans to turn this software into a custodial service. \nSee the Bitcoin Wallet Comparison for alternatives that better suite your needs. You're probably looking for something in the \"Bitcoin Account Services\" section.. Thanks for the thoughtful comment @dabura667. (And for your continued contributions!). @Cassiebas what app are you using, and which version?. @Cassiebas what was the process you followed to create your wallet?. @Cassiebas \nThere are currently 133 people \"watching\" this repo on GitHub, and most of us received your backup phrase in an email. Any of these people can now spend any money you send to the wallet. Do not send funds to that wallet.\nYou should assume that the wallet is compromised, and create a new one instead. \nBefore you do anything else, take some time to learn more about Bitcoin: https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know. It's not possible to reverse a bitcoin transaction. The recipient must send the funds back to you.\nPlease note, BitPay (the company I work for) does not control your funds, and does not provide recovery services.\nYou got very lucky though \u2013 my transaction confirmed before anyone else was able to take it. Send me an email (github@bitjson.com), and I'll give it back to you.. Glad it worked out.

You can learn more about bitcoin here: https://bitcoin.org/. What do you mean by wallet authorization code?\nIf you have your 12 word backup, you should be able to import it into any version of Copay.\n(Closing, since this isn't a bug report or feature request.). @cmgustavo ready for review \ud83d\ude80 . I'll rebase this PR after https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/8014 lands.. @SonicWizard https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/8086. If you'd rather not use the desktop version, you can always clone this repo and run it in a web browser yourself. Just follow the instructions in the Readme \ud83d\udc4d. the first param for popupService.showAlert is an Optional Title \u2013 I think in this context, we're better off not showing a title here. We definitely don't want to say \"Error\", because it's not an unexpected bug \u2013 the payment request has just expired already.\nIt would be good to polish the sentence though: The payment request has expired should be: This bitcoin payment request has expired.\n. (might want to make this === null)\n. Good catch, thanks! Fixed in the latest commit.\n. I was thinking it would be a good idea to make the logic a little more explicit \u2013 reading through the code doesn't make it very obvious. (Maybe we can leave it explicit until we have unit tests for this view?)\n. Actually that's the part I removed intentionally. It's the most frightening or potentially misleading part \u2013 we can either show the pending, unconfirmed total (which makes it seem like the money is \"there\" already) or we can show status.totalBalanceAlternative which is really scary if most of the wallet is \"unconfirmed\" \u2013 for users that just created and loaded a wallet, the status.totalBalanceAlternative usually shows `$0 (which is when they start freaking out).\nI think we need to take another look at all of this design-wise (as a future feature). For now, I think removing it (like in the screencap above) avoids both issues adequately.\n. Note: without hiding in that screencap, the users \"USD balance\" would have looked like it \"dropped\" from ~$40k to ~$1... (until the TX confirmed)\n. I think we want to be determining this functionality based on device capabilities, rather than the specific platform. Maybe @msalcala11 should look at this too?\n. Can we do this as a move rather than an add? (We can delete this file from the old sass dir.) Would help to be able to track where things are coming from.. Same here, I think it would be good to delete the old one as we bring this one in to this structure.. @ajp8164 this file includes a lot of overrides where none are needed \u2013 all onboarding styles are already defined here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/src/sass/views/onboarding/onboarding.scss\nCan we just use variables to override these things? If we write everything twice, our scss will become very brittle.. This creates a somewhat-leaky abstraction of our actual variables:\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/src/sass/variables.scss\nWe're using Ionic v1's framework of variables, and only overriding things where truly necessary. (Otherwise our CSS will expand until it's unmaintainable, it will eventually become \"write-only\", and we'll ultimately have to trash it and start over.). These should probably be added to the rest of our variables: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/src/sass/variables.scss. @cmgustavo would you mind sending a PR to @ajp8164's branch to do that?. Can this have a real return type?. Can't this type be inferred?. Can this be uncommented or deleted before we merge?. should this use $app-bg-color;?. Good catch, thanks! (cc @vanhue). Why wrap this in a new Promise? It's much simpler to just return and use the observable.\n(Also, this breaks unit tests). Isn't there a less brittle way to do this than setTimeout? At the very least it makes testing messy.. Can we add some unit tests here? This is really important logic, and we need to make sure it doesn't ever break. \n. Looks like an fdescribe was left in here. Could you add the types of methods? version here is a string right? (Ideally we can get real types for everything, without using any). ",

Hi @cmgustavo . It looks like you haven't started or not properly configured API proxy (step 4). Please check you config. In my config I've added the following:\ncoloredCoins: {\n  apiHost: 'localhost:8000'\n},\nthen you have to run apiProxy.js on the server (it should work along with Copay server):\nnode bower_components/copay-colored-coins-plugin/server/apiProxy.js\n. I've just amended setup steps a bit, so it should be more straightforward now.\n. As for addon distribution, my idea is that people interested in running their own custom Copay instance may use any addons on their own risk. It would be good to have the list of addons in a single place though, albeit they don't need to be necessarily verified - just make clear that they should be used with caution.\n. resolved \nhttps://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/issues/230\n. resolved \nhttps://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/issues/230\n.

Got similar error on the third try on copay master. \nCould you please check if it's reproduced for you on the codebase before this PR ?\n. @cmgustavo As I've already written, I was able to reproduce it and even backtrace the source.\nI don't have enough time to fix qrScanner library, so I've added quick workaround for this problem: now scanner returns result only if two consecutive scans produce the same data. This fix slows scanning process a bit, but fixed the issue for me. Also this fix won't work if the QR image is not moving, because obviously in this case two consecutive scans will also produce same result and both may be incorrect.\nPlease check if this fix resolves the issue for you.\n. Hm.. nevermind. It works now. I will try to clear out what happened\n. Rebased\n. Rebased\n. Rebased\n. Rebased\n. @cmgustavo Yes, I have the same. The reason for this is that go.walletHome (which calls setTab) is being called even for Preferences - why it should?\n. Without my code it just tries to setTab several times and eventually fails. For user everything is fine, but this kind of logic is very confusing for developer\n. My reasoning is following: setTab is a function to set tab on the wallet home - it is the only view that has tabs. So in theory it should be perfectly safe to switch to Home in setTab - we shouldn't be calling setTab from other views anyway. But in reality it's flawed - go.walletHome() is being called for ANY view in Local/NewFocusedWallet event handler.\n. @cmgustavo Please take a look at https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/3153 if it resolves the issue for you?\n. Rebased\n. Fixed!\n. Correct\n. Yes, it's weird. ColoredCoins logo is displayed using CSS background property and it works fine. But, yes, Copay logo disappears\n.

I'm using default 1-of-1 livenet wallet.\n.

Using mnemonics?\nUsing json file\n. I can give you wallet id if it helps\n. Ok, found the date in logs. This wallet was created at 4th September 2015\n. Wallet has version \"1.0.0\".

Rebased\n. Rebased\n. Rebased\n. Please let me when you have time for this, so I don't rebase it every week\n. I see it's related to SJCL\n. Well, it's reported already https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/issues/316\n. I'm now unable to build my Copay fork (based on Copay 2.7.0) because of this issue. It used to run fine and now it is not. I suppose it is somehow related to the npm version. Already spent multiple hours trying to figure out how to fix it, but no success.\n\nSome observations:\nbitcore-wallet-client v2.11.0 (the one used in Copay 2.7.0) depends on bitcore-lib 0.13.5 while some of other dependencies (like bitcore-mnemonic) depend on bitcore-lib 0.14.0 and bitcore-lib 0.13.9. All this soup is being browserified into the angular-bitcore-wallet-client \u2014 I have at least two copies on bitcore-lib there. Alright, I sorted it out.\nThe solution for my particular case (I'm using old Copay 2.7.0) is to explicitly set previous stable versions on bitcore-mnemonic and bitcore-payment-protocol to be used in bitcore-wallet-client:\n\"bitcore-mnemonic\": \"1.1.1\",\n    \"bitcore-payment-protocol\": \"1.1.0\"\nThe reason? Bitpay released new \"minor\" versions of bitcore-mnemonic and bitcore-payment-protocol this March. These versions depend on bitcore-lib. So when bitcore-wallet-client is being browserified for Copay two bitcore-lib definitions slip into the result and \u2014 bam! \u2014 dreaded version guard is on duty.\nActually, this is a breaking change to me, so it should not be a minor version bump.\n. As I outlined in PR description, colored addon subscribes to this event: https://github.com/troggy/copay-colored-coins-plugin/blob/master/js/controllers/assets.js#L9\n. Fixed. Thanks for review!\n. You probably wanted to ask why I've added go.path() ? Exactly for that purpose -- to set state to walletHome when setTab is called from other state.\n. .logo and .logo-setup are not used in the code\n. ",

FYI: I just submitted a PR which adds existing tests to mocha index.html.\n. what about package.json \"test\" script?  that entry also specifies \"firefox\".\n. Thanks for the feedback. Regarding the black triangle and expanding one at a time:  the primary use case that I am designing for is a proposal with more than 100 outputs, where the copay user does not necessarily want to look at every output. The application that creates the proposal will build the list of outputs ordered by descending amount, so the largest outputs will appear first. If we expand the list of 100+ outputs with a single click, then the copay user will need to scroll down very far to reach the Accept button.\nI am open to alternative designs, as long as the experience is very good for my use case.\n. I replaced the expand-one-output-at-a-time UX with a toggle show-all / hide-all experience.\nA completely different solution might be to follow the UpdateTxHistory pattern, showing a \"MORE\" button after 5 outputs are displayed. \nI would welcome suggestions on icons and toggle-vs-more patterns. For icons, I think we have access to any of the icons shown here: http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3\n. this change worked fine in other test files, like test.TxProposals.js. it passes in mocha in the shell and in the browser. why would it cause karma to fail?\n. I replaced the old try/catch block to the file, and karma still failed.\n. not yet, let me revert everything :-(\n.

Do those tests include karma?\n. even after I revert all my changes, karma still fails. in addition, mocha now also fails! some other code change pulled after my 5853a19 (https://github.com/bitpay/copay/commit/5853a197e5414b0ec3e7bb426eb2a9500513090c)  has broken mocha. \ninstead of reverting my changes, i'm going to dig into the problems that appear in tests for storage.LocalEncrypted, Wallet, and WalletFactory.\n. This is what I did:\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout master\ngit merge upstream/master\nIs this equivalent to rebase?  If not, what are the git commands for rebase?\n. Here is what I just did:\ncd ~/dev/copay\nrm -rf node_modules\ngit checkout upstream/master -b bp-master\nnpm i\nbower i\ngrunt --target=dev shell\nnode_modules/.bin/mocha \nopen test/index.html \nnode ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start\nResults:\n- mocha from the shell was completely successful with 315 passing tests\n- mocha in the browser had 77 passes and 47 failures related to test.Wallet.js\n- karma had numerous errors related to \"cannot find module lib/PayPro\", \"uncaught error at /lib/angular/angular.min.js:20\", \"cannot read prototype of undefined at test/mocks/FakeWallet.js:80\".\nDo you see the same errors? \n. I now have 7 copies of bitcore in my ~/dev directory:\n./bitcore\n./bitpay/node_modules/bitcore\n./bputil/node_modules/bitcore\n./bputil/node_modules/bitpay-client/node_modules/bitcore\n./copay/node_modules/bitcore\n./dashboard/www/lib/bitcore\n./node_modules/bitcore\nWhich one should I use for \"bower link\" ?\n. should be \"\u00c4nderungen\"\n. \"konnte\" vs \"kann\" inconsistent translation of \"could\" across these three messages\n. if you intended all language names to be represented in the target language, then i think this should be \"portugu\u00eas\"\n. should be \"Das Einrichten\" with uppercase \"E\" ?\n. when i click on the arrow, it does not expand the list of recipients. perhaps the list is not populated? that problem only occurs in txhistory details. the txproposal details works correctly.\n. Good idea to consolidate the redundant processTx() functionality here. It makes index.js much cleaner.\nThe name of this service, 'utilService', does not indicate what kind of utility it is providing. Do you intend for it to offer a wide variety of functionality?\n. Nice UX improvement, removing the lines between list items. Much easier for the user to read the list of recipients.\n. ",

The only difference between a messaging app and Copay is transaction history management/accounting and Ux (in a multisig env).  All messages are pay as you go and guaranteed secure/provable by the blockchain.  Cool idea Eric!\n. Copay is already hard to use and is getting more difficult for the average person.  Many of the \"advanced\" features of Copay should be buried in a \"developer mode\" that is off by default.  If this feature can't be 100% transparent to \"I wan to send a payment\" then it too should be buried in a \"developer mode\".\n. After you add a recipient how does Copay know how much money to send to each recipient?\n. Recipient name [required]\nAmount [required]\nLabel/memo [optional]\n\nShould be able to toggle amount between bitcoin and wallet alternative currency.\nAll other rules (if any) are picked up from wallet config.\n. If send max is chosen then the amount for each recipient may need to be adjusted after a proposal is created.  Can you adjust a proposed tx after it's been created?\n. Thinking through this there are many \"fearures\" that can be layered here.  I suggest doing exactly what Bitcoin core does and enhance later.  Keep it simple for now.\n. I like this thread :-)  Bitcoin is not all about privacy.  Security and convenience are just as (if not more) important than security.  +1 for this.\n. Sorry, should have mentioned that I am using copay/master (v2.0.0), updated yesterday.  Just looked at outstanding commits and didn't see anything that addresses this issue.\n. Related https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/4443\n. Works good in 2.1.0.  Thanks!\n. The common Bitcoin user needs an education.  The longer we wait to make the change the more resistance their will be to make the change.\n. The user is buying confirmation time with fee.  The number of tx inputs is simply a multiplier.  However, all fee estimation vs. time is an exercise in probability. There is no answer, just a range of possible outcome. IMO, the best way to present anything this complex is to use a graphical representation.  A probability cone or normal distribution could be used to render the relationship between fee and confirmation time using the number of tx inputs as a scalar.. I'll try to take a crack at it ;-). Correct, should be able copy just a portion of the log to the clipboard.

I think that hurts UX. @bitjson needs to look at how to get better utility out of the tabs based on context (in this case the context is a selected wallet).\nKeep the tabs and when i select a wallet set a \"selected wallet\" and make the tabs do the following:\nHome - Go back to home screen (same as tapping left arrow in wallet header).\nReceive - Show receive view with selected wallet receive address chosen (qr is for selected wallet, scrolled item is selected wallet).\nScan - No change though the result of scan to pay should present the view defaulted to paying from the selected wallet.\nSend - Flow should default to sending from the selected wallet.\nSettings - Show selected wallet settings view (a child of the main settings view).\n. Really both.  The app needs to capture the device name \"Andy's iPhone\" and wallet t needs to be provided to the bitpay.com dashboard and displayed there.\n\nAndy Phillipson\nDirector of Engineering Services, BitPay, Inc.\n844A CCA5 F277 30C0 E86F  9799 0CEE 502F 2484 0854\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Oct 26, 2016, at 7:55 AM, Matias Alejo Garcia notifications@github.com wrote:\nThis is a bitpay.com ticket, no Bitpay app, isn't it?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. @bitjson?\n\n\nAndy Phillipson\nDirector of Engineering Services, BitPay, Inc.\n844A CCA5 F277 30C0 E86F  9799 0CEE 502F 2484 0854\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Oct 25, 2016, at 1:25 PM, Javier Donad\u00edo notifications@github.com wrote:\nMaybe we should hide the tab bar?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. \"Accepted\" (I think) means \"signed\" so maybe we should use \"Signed\".\n\nInstead of \"Broadcast\" what about \"Complete\".  \"Broadcast\" sort of implies that something comes next.

NSF = not sufficient funds\n. I noticed this during testing.  The problem is that bitpay.com is sending all the emails and it sends the \"device paired\" email without a confirmation from the device that the pairing actually completed.  My opinion is that the device should make a final api call to the bitpay server using the account credentials that says it completed the pairing process.  Only then should the bitpay server send the \"device paired\" email.\n. @bitjson should comment on this.. Should also refresh any balances displayed on a view when the app comes forward from the background.. Still don't understand the cancel button.\n\nWe should have a way to remove/hide a card that I know to be redeemed.  Maybe we offer an \"archive\" feature that hides the card rather than deleting it to prevent people from deleting possibly un-redeemed card accidentally. Need a way to recover the card out of the archive (hidden list).. See https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5196. It may have more logic later.  I had thought about adding a \"refresh\" button to refresh balances.  We may also want to consider providing details behind confirming and locked amounts (like lists of tx and txp's).\nBut we can remove if for now and add the t back later as we need.\n--\nAndy Phillipson\nDirector of Engineering Services, BitPay, Inc.\n844A CCA5 F277 30C0 E86F  9799 0CEE 502F 2484 0854\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Dec 12, 2016, at 1:32 PM, Javier Donad\u00edo notifications@github.com wrote:\n@JDonadio commented on this pull request.\nIn src/js/controllers/modals/walletBalance.js:\n\n@@ -0,0 +1,9 @@\n+'use strict';\n+\n+angular.module('copayApp.controllers').controller('walletBalanceController', function($scope) {\n+\n+  $scope.close = function() {\n+    $scope.walletBalanceModal.hide();\nPlease, if the controller will not have more logic just use the next line on Close button in the HTML tag\n\nng-click=\"walletBalanceModal.hide()\"\nAnd delete the controller\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Agree. Also, I think \"Error at confirm\" is not correct or informative.  It's not an error.  Should say something like \"Cannot create transaction\".  It's a \"policy\" statement, not an error condition.. I discussed with Ivan (I think, could have been Javier).  Other paths in this method return an error string and this path was previously returning an object which results in a rather ugly error on the UI (string representation of a Json object).. We may not need the new \"if\" statements in walletService.js because the errors are not changed from BWC (I think they will end up being noops).  bwcErrors should be able to work fine with the just the return cb(err) statement.. Ok, I'll have a look at it today . See https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/5414. Implemented UI.\n\n\n. Also see #5404 . @bitjson closing this. Re-open if you think it's usable... Home view with multiple cards across multiple accounts (no UX changes).\n\nAdd/pair card base view (no UX changes).\n\nAdd/pair card view after clicking \"Connect my BitPay card\" when at least one account is already paired (new account selector slides up).  No account selector if no accounts paired (launches browser as expected). Clicking \"Add account\" launches browser to pair as expected.\n\nSettings view when at least one account is paired (entry is updated).\n\nSettings view now lists each card and account separately. Can remove cards or accounts. Removing an account removes all cards attached to the account. If card removed it can be quickly re-added using new account selector seen above (no new pairing hassle since account is still paired).\n\n. Fix is replace\nif (!satoshis) return;\nwith \nif (satoshis == undefined) return;. 640 x 1136. I'll make it a private function.. The server needs to not send unactivated card data to the wallet.  No way to detect this in the wallet.  This may already be happening.. No longer needed.. Done.. Thanks!. Done.\nIncidentally, the other services (like Amazon) do use getEnvironment() to return a network string (not an object).  They should be fixed too ;-). Done.. That TODO is not a requirement; just something I thought about for the future.  I removed the comment.. Done.  New keys is of the form bitpayAccounts-v2-livenet.\nThe obsolete key is deleted after the upgrade completes (delete bitpayAccounts-livenet).\nStartup during the upgrade now looks like this:\nStarting...\nVerifying storage...\nStorage upgraded for 'bitpayCardCredentials-livenet': replaced with 'appIdentity'\nStorage upgraded for 'bitpayAccounts-livenet': upgraded to 'bitpayAccounts-v2-livenet': andyphillipson@gmail.com\nStorage OK\nInit profile....

    "chjj": "Also, rebasing onto master real quick. (Then hopefully fixing the CSS for notification windows so it can fit the server memo before the merge).\n. Alright, rebased onto master. Two issues:\n- I'm not sure if this is from the rebase, but master seems to have an undefined variable in the settings controller, fixed here: 07b9c47ef9407561911c1b57ca569da8273a6afb\n- With the new rebase onto master, the Send Proposals element is displayed even after sending a Payment (with tx) to the pay server, despite the notifications saying everything went through and has already been sent/broadcasted. It should probably be hidden even though a pay server would typically ignore a double Payment request based on the merchant data, plus there's no harm in broadcasting the same exact TX more than once.\nOther than that, the tests pass in both the browser and node, and I think we may be ready for a merge.\ncc @matiu @cmgustavo @maraoz - What do you guys think?\n. Just another thought: does anyone more in tune with angular have a better method of doing this (resetting the form which was forcefully altered through the DOM)?\nhttps://github.com/chjj/copay/blob/paypro/js/directives.js#L98-127\n. @cmgustavo, thank you.

I'm guessing it pertains the conflicts I resolved in send.html. I'll fix it.\n. Alright, fixed the rebase issue. Onto fixing the Wallet test.\n. Alright, the paypro test is fixed. The Wallet test was even failing on master with bitcore v0.1.36. Reverting to v0.1.35 seemed to fix the problem. I narrowed down the issue to this one line change in bitcore that happened between 0.1.35 and 0.1.36: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/pull/510\n. It looks like the Wallet test may be incorrect. We're sorting through it right now.\n. Alright, test.Wallet failure is fixed. All tests passing. This is ready for release.\nThe Wallet test failure had nothing to do with the paypro branch. It's related to something deep in either copay or bitcore that doesn't like null/undefuned/0 fee values. When we switched to the latest version of bitcore, this test started failing because of that one commit referenced above (it was a pull request not pertaining to payment protocol at all).\n. Manuel and I will fix bitcore tomorrow and merge this in.\n. On second thought, bitcore is secure in this slightly flawed manner, we will merge this in.\n.

I see what's causing this. The example paypro server doesn't actually broadcast transactions unless you tell it to. This means it won't run the proper code to mark a transaction as sent after \"sending\" it. Insight checks the blockchain to see if the tx was sent and sees nothing, so the code doesn't mark it as sent. When you try to open your wallet again, there's still a tx proposal that's unsent with a weird number of signers or something of that nature, so the TxProposal(s) class throws that error.\nThis should not happen in production (try enabling broadcasting of transactions in the paypro example server).\n.

This commit: 5e04d3aec5c0139bf3340e4eda8c31dcdfcb5057 seems to fix it, but broadcasting it ourselves on the blockchain defeats the purpose of having the payment protocol server broadcast it.\n.

It only returns the PaymentACK after the tx has been acknowledged by a peer and broadcasted instead of simply returning the ACK immediately without broadcasting the TX.

Having code changed which breaks the once working payment protocol code constantly, without anyone telling me or taking it into account themselves, is tiring me out.\n. I'm in the midst of fixing the tests now. Should be done soon.\n. @maraoz, I have a lot on my plate right now. I said I'm fixing the tests now. Did you pull this branch? It works properly with payment protocol. I just used it. I'm not responsible for everyone else changing code in copay and breaking my code. I end up having to clean up something that isn't my mess. Every time I rebase, something breaks. Just wait. I'll get the tests working now.\n. @maraoz, the tests should be fixed. I ran mocha tests in node, and karma is passing. Would appreciate a pull now.\nThis PR fixes:\n- The transaction error\n- The bad signature login error\n- merchant_data handling on tx proposals\n. Try deleting this branch and fetching it from scratch. That issue was fixed with https://github.com/chjj/copay/commit/66b845f7fde4ae67f16f0d84e51126160387c534\nIt was returning the txid as an error, so copay thought the tx failed. It's fixed now. I don't get that error.\n. Agreed. I intentionally made it that way to editors don't have to spend a ton of CPU wrapping the line.\n. ",

The reason is this check was done before applying fees. As fees require knowing in advance the size of the transaction, it is difficult to take it into account.

This is what gets sent to other copayers so they can in turn sign it. Once other copayers have a copy of this proposal, there is nothing that the creator can do to stop them from signing it and broadcasting it (assuming the required nb of signatures has been reached)\n. +1 We will be looking into this on future releases\n. Hi, what version of Copay are you using? There was a problem in 0.9.1 that could be causing this issue but it was fixed in 0.9.2\n. This node.js script:\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/util/swipeWallet.js\nCan be used to recover funds from lost wallets as long as you know at least the minimum number of master private keys for the wallet. One way to recover the funds from the lost wallet would be to create a new wallet (or use an existing one) and run the script sending all funds to an address in the new wallet. Please let me know if you need help setting up the environment to run the script.\n. Please make sure you have the latest version of the code. Also, make sure you list keys separated by comma and no spaces as otherwise it would take it as a separate argument.\n. It shouldn't matter. I just tried with a couple of wallets and everything went ok. When I entered keys with space or twice the same key though, I got the 0 satoshis message too. \n. Wallets are independent. To recover the 2-of-2 wallet you need to have both Master Private Keys for that wallet. Can you get both keys for that wallet? Or maybe both backup files?\n. For privacy reasons, Copay does not track user logins so it is not possible to detect inactive accounts. Another problem I see is that Copay stores your wallets encrypted with your password. If your brother was given a copy of your profile, he would still not be able to extract the private key without also having the password. \nMaybe you could give him your wallet backup now and use an external service to deliver the password by email in case you fail to show some kind of activity in a period of time?\n. I think it would work to do it that way. That being said, I also think Copay should not implement features that compromise user privacy (such as tracking login activity or keeping unencrypted email addresses).\nHave you thought about keeping the password to one of the profiles as part of your will? I think by being multi-sig, this becomes a safe option for people in your situation.\n. Great job!\nJust to try and give you some context for the missing strings:\n\nAmount in\n\nUsed to display an amount in the selected alternative currency (USD, EUR, etc). E.g. 'Amount in USD'.\n\nLogin Required\n\nThe application requires the user to login using their username and password (just a dummy string for translations so I think it's ok to skip).\n\nScaning for transactions\n\nSearching the blockchain for transactions using the list of addresses belonging to this wallet.\n\nSkipping fields: {{skipFields}}\n\nWhen importing a wallet, some fields that are present in the backup file are not imported.\n\nUsing network:\n\nWhen creating a wallet, the user is given the option to create it on the 'livenet' network or the 'testnet' network. This string refers to which network the wallet will be created on.\nThanks!\n. done!\n. Some progress has been done on this, please see https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/pull/339\n. +1\nAlso support BIP38.\nIf the sweeping is done through a TX to send funds into a Copay address, the same strategy could be used to import 12 word phrases from BIP44 wallets.\n.

Great job!\nA couple of notes:\n- I think the link \"send to my wallets\" needs a better UI design. It doesn't look like something that I can tap on.\n- After a wallet is selected from the list, the flow continues as if I had scanned an address. Do you think it would be useful to show some kind of note stating that the address belongs to the wallet I selected?\n. Thanks!\n. Super useful feature. Great job!\n. I don't know if this is related to changes in this PR.\nI recreated a testnet wallet I already had on my profile.\nI pointed Copay to the staging BWS.\nCopay asked me to recreate the wallet which I did. Balance of 0 BTC was shown (correct)\nI now change either the unit preferences or the language preferences.\nWhen I go back to the home screen, Copay asks me to recreate my wallet.\nBTW I have other non-recreated wallets on the same profile.\n.

Actually, unconfirmed transactions can be used as inputs for new transactions and Copay allows this by default.

Lots of new features, bug fixes, usability improvements, and UI polishing were added since 1.2. You are missing push notifications, payment proposal confirmation before creation (with exact fee used), tx history search, to name a few.\nAlso, did you know that during recent backlog congestion, Copay's dynamic fee raised to around 600bits/kb (priority setting) which is even higher than the old fixed 500bits emergency setting for transactions > 1k?\nI don't think setting the fee in a static way without having a ton of other information about a transaction and the state of the network is something people is supposed to do. There are way too many factors to consider. Who is going to deal with people having their transactions stuck because they chose the wrong fee? Do you know how frustrating that is for newcomers and even regular users?\nAnd on top of all these arguments, it is just not Copay's goal of being an extremely secure yet easy to use wallet.\n. There are several reasons why we decided to hide the list of addresses:\n- It discourages address reuse.\n- It allows for a simpler and cleaner UI which improves usability.\n- All addresses shown to the user have to be derived locally (to prove they actually belong to the wallet).

It should default to the historic amount in fiat and clicking on it could show how much 1 BTC was worth on that date (I think this is the current behavior).. For the time being, I think the best thing we can do is ignore RBF transactions until they get 1 confirmation (at which point the user will get notified of the incoming tx). Adding extra messages and warnings to the UI will only increase complexity for non-expert users.\nIf RBF transactions become the norm, we can review this policy. \n. Hi. BIP44 dictates that the maximum number of consecutive addresses without any activity in a wallet should not be greater than 20. The error message you are getting means the app is trying to generate that 21th address. Earlier versions of Copay did not have that check in place, maybe that is why the OSX app did work for you? Did you retry sending from the iOS app after the incident?\n. I suspect this issue is related to having the \"Use unconfirmed funds\" set to OFF (i.e. only send confirmed funds) and trying to \"Send all\" while there are unconfirmed funds in the wallet. Does this sound like something you might be running into?\n. Was that 1 btc input confirmed on the same \"session\" (meaning, you didn't close/repoen Copay) in which you performed the send all?\n. Thank you for your valuable feedback. We were able to identify the issue and we are working on a fix. Will keep you posted.\n. ACK!\n. The appropriate wallet is being selected now. Also, selecting the exact tx is not that important since it will be first on the Activity list.\n. The appropriate wallet is being selected now.

FYI in the upcoming version of Copay (v1.9) there will be a way to check the final fee of a transaction before sending. Hopefully this will help detect any potential problems. I'm closing this one for now. Please reopen if you keep having issues. Thanks.\n. Just for the record, we found an issue that could have been the culprit in this case. If Copay was unable to get fee values from the server (in most cases due to poor connectivity or network issues), a hardcoded value of 100bits/kB was being used. This worked well in the past but recent surge in transactions has made this value too low. This PR https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/3950 removes this default preventing any txs to be created with low fees. The change will be available in the upcoming version of Copay.\nThank you for your report!\n. @dabura667 is it really the case that lower value transactions can wait longer to get confirmed? In my experience, even when I am paying for something inexpensive, I want to be certain it confirms fast. It seems to me making it a per-wallet setting would still be off with respect to real use.\n. I like the idea of having a way to estimate how long it will take for a tx to confirm. I don't think showing the fee is the right approach though. Unless you also know the size of the tx, the status of the Bitcoin network, if the tx has unconfirmed parents, etc, it is going to be really hard to estimate.\nMaybe Copay could evaluate these parameters for you and assess the expected time/blocks for a  confirmation?\n.

Actually, the tx hash you are providing already has 260 confirmations. Also, looks like the 0.059 btc were already spent by this tx: https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/a76a90590846f76de7405bab3b9a0da9ea1cd7f978692df2ca72007c518a496d\n. There is a protection in place to avoid one copayer attacking other copayers by making funds impossible to withdraw. If a given nb of consecutive proposals are rejected by other copayers in the wallet, a lock time is applied and the offending copayer needs to wait 24hs before creating a new tx. This is most likely what was happening to you.\n. Glad to know it its working ok now :smile: \n. Yes, what @dan-da said is exactly true. There has been work on an improved algorithm for input selection so as to minimize the amount locked by a spending proposal (although the problem can not be completely solved).\n. LGTM\n.

It contributed nothing to your request.\n. +1. Also there is no clear way to translate the term without sounding really awkward.\n. Done! Expect this feature on the next release. Thanks.\n. ACK\n. You are right there is an inherent asymmetry in the initial creation of a multi-sig wallet. But IMO, these issues need to be addressed by off-channel communication. Either an email, IM or a phone call between copayers sharing the first 4 digits or so of the wallet ID (available at Preferences -> Advanced -> Wallet Information) should do the trick.\n. If you have access to all 4 backups (12 words or export files), I would recommend you use the Copay recovery tool to move funds to a new 1-of-1 wallet that will only require your signature.\n. Just to clarify: there is nothing that can be done server-side to help you with this. Private keys are held by copayers on their devices and are never shared with the server. If access to the devices is not possible for whatever reason, backups (which are mandatory on Copay BTW) should be used to restore access to the wallet.\nFrom your post I guess yours is a 2-of-4 wallet. If you are able to get one of the other 3 backups (either as a 12 word phrase or as an export file) you could use that to import the wallet in a separate device and that would also allow you to transfer the funds.\n. @dabura667 I agree!

Maybe we could make it available for translation with an annotation for translators stating that it is optional and explaining the reason? It wouldn't hurt having this translated in advance for future exchange integrations.\n. Well done but I don't think this fixes #4550. A complete solution would assume an external backup phrase is already backed up.\n. Sorry, it seems to only happen on multi-sig (from the tx proposal details view). I created a payment proposal from my PC and tried to apply the last signature on my phone. Canceling the fingerprint verification lead to this screen:\n\n. The import code expected by Copay has the format:\n<type>|<words>|<network>|<derivation_path>|<has_passphrase>\nwhere type should be 1 for mnemonics, network one of livenet/testnet, most common derivation_path should be m/44'/0'/0' for livenet & m/44'/1'/0' for testnet. has_passphrase is either true or false.\nNote: there is nothing in the import procedure that prevents 24 words mnemonics. The only constraint is the code density used in the export UI but I guess if you are generating the code, it should be ok.\nHope this helps.\n. When you first created your wallet, Copay gave you 12 words. Did you write those words down?\n. Without those 12 words there is not much you can do to recover the funds.\n. Remember to always write the phrase down and keep it safe. Preferably more than one copy, just in case. Good luck!\n. ACK!\n. Resulting amount not valid when thousands separator is used:\n\n. When typing USD 9999 and pressing 'OK'  the amount will not reflect on the send screen.\n. ACK! Great job!! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Hi! Maybe I can help. Take a look at https://gist.github.com/isocolsky/b3a73aa6b33065b6f8d8396be8ecf5cc\nThe script will go through a list of candidate mnemonics (in a 'mnemonics.txt' file) checking each one for activity on the blockchain. Try it with a wallet you know has had some activity first so you know its working.\nLet me know how it goes. Good luck!\n. Fixed by https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/pull/596. I could reproduce the issue. While it can be confusing, it is just a visualization issue. All amounts are handled internally in satoshi and are correct (if you switch to using bits you will see the expected amount).\n. A fix has been submitted here https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-client/pull/300, it will be reviewed and merged soon. Thank you for your report!\n. ACK\n. Would it make sense to preset an \"external tx fee level\" and an \"internal tx fee level\" globally in cases where there are more than one wallet on a device? Or would it be too hard to communicate?\n. It is working as expected now. Will leave this open so we can investigate.\n. can you try to open this link https://bws.bitpay.com/bws/api/v1/version on a browser?\n. Only 20 consecutive empty addresses are allowed. After that, no new addresses will be generated and the last one will be shown in the Receive tab. However, if you receive funds on any of the last 20 addresses, it restarts the process and new addresses can be generated (how many depends on which address got the funds).\nEdit: by \"empty\" I mean addresses not used in any transaction.\n. Every single address in a Copay wallet (including change addresses) is deterministically derived from a single Master Extended Private Key (which is obtained from the 12 words). So as long as you keep these words, your funds will be safe regardless of how many addresses you have generated.\nThe issue is with the discoverability of the funds. The algorithm used by Copay and described in the BIP32 will generate all addresses one by one in order querying the blockchain for activity (transactions) until 20 consecutive addresses are generated with no transactions associated. If this arbitrary limit was lifted, you could continue generating millions of addresses. So the limit is just there for practical reasons. It just works fine for 99% of the use-cases.\n. If the recovery tool indicated that there was no balance, chances are the coins are gone. To be sure, get a clean Copay install. Go to Add Wallet -> Import and enter the 12 words.\n. This is just the way Bitcoin works. The rest of your coins were sent to a change address which is part of your wallet. Once the tx confirms (which should have already happened) you should see the expected balance.\n. Glad to hear everything is ok.\nFunds in bitcoin are spent in chunks. These chunks correspond to the transactions you received but not yet spent. So if you receive a tx for 1 BTC and you want to send 0.8 BTC to someone else, you will be using that 1 BTC transaction as the input. Since partially spending is not possible you will need to specify where to receive the remaining 0.2 BTC (minus fees). So after the new transaction has been broacasted you will become the recipient of your own transaction which will be interpreted by the wallet as you having a 0.2 BTC balance.\nEdit: this article explains this in more depth http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-do-bitcoin-transactions-work/\n. The wallet handles that for you so you would experience it as a simple spending operation. The address belongs to a separate branch of addresses called \"change addresses\" but is still part of your wallet.\n. We all love Bitcoin :D\nWRT privacy, Copay does not collect personal information from the user or from the device. All sensitive data (like messages attached to txs) is locally encrypted before sent to the server. \nHaving said this, servers are able to log info and it is a good practice to always assume they do.\nIf you are concerned about your privacy, and have the technical knowledge, there is always the option of running Copay's server Bitcore Wallet Service locally.\n. One more thing\n\nAfter all crypto is supposed to be anonymous right?\n\nBitcoin is not anonymous. You could preserve your privacy while transacting but it is really hard to do so and it is usually possible to tie addresses together as belonging to the same person. This could change in the future though.\n. I do not have an opinion on that \ud83d\ude4a \ud83d\ude09 . Best thing is to do some research.\nGood luck!\n. Hi, good catch.\nWhat is happening is the QR will get generated 1. from the recovery phrase if available or 2. from the master extended private key if the recovery phrase was deleted.\nWhen importing from a QR of type 1, the recovery phrase is used to generate the master extended private key but this step requires a password (if one was set at creation time). In the case of a type 2 QR, the private key is already there so no other data is needed from the user.\nWe will look into this.\nThank you for reporting!\n. Private keys never leave your device so a compromised server would not be able to steal funds. Copay does share the Extended Public Key with the server. This means the server is able to tell your balance and all incoming and outgoing transactions associated with your wallet.\n. Well no, it goes something like this:\n\nWhere BWS is the Bitcore Wallet Service (Copay's server). And Insight is BitPay's open source block explorer which communicates directly with a bitcoind node.\n. Hi, your first request is discussed on issue #4603.\nCould you please close this issue and reopen with just your second request? It will help to keep the discussion focused and improve traceability.\nThanks!\n. Funds in bitcoin are spent in chunks. These chunks correspond to the transactions you received but not yet spent. So if you receive a tx for 1 BTC and you want to send 0.8 BTC to someone else, you will be using that 1 BTC transaction as the input. Since partially spending is not possible you will need to specify where to receive the remaining 0.2 BTC (minus fees). So after the new transaction has been broadcasted you will become the recipient of your own transaction which will be interpreted by the wallet as you having a 0.2 BTC balance. Copay handles all this for you using what is called a change address.\nIn your case, the change amount will be pending confirmation until the last transaction gets confirmed.\nThis article explains this in more depth http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-do-bitcoin-transactions-work/\n. Yes definitely. A help sign right next to the pending amount could bring up a message explaining this for people who are new to Bitcoin.\n. I agree with @dabura667 . This is confusing for new users. But I think the best solution is treating change as safe to spend. Since Copay is making the transaction we can assume it will confirm eventually. So the \"spend unconfirmed\" will only apply to external incoming txs which makes more sense IMO.\n. Copay relies on Bitcore Wallet Service to keep wallets in sync across devices. The default Copay install points to the public BWS instance at BitPay's servers but you can run your own as it is all opens source.\n. Hi! Could you please paste the address here so we can check? Thanks.\n. Hi, I'm trying to generate the extended private key from your 12 words but I get an error. I checked all words individually to make sure they belong to the BIP39 list and they actually do. So I think there is an issue with the checksum. Could it be possible the words were not written in the correct order?\n. There is no way to copy-paste the 12 words for a livenet wallet in Copay. Also, we haven't had any other report about this but will keep investigating. Thank you for reporting.\n. In many of these cases there is a way to recover at least one address of the wallet in question. In this case, it is possible that @KeyJockey can get the destination address for the transaction transferring the $1. That way, we only have to derive the m/44'/0'/0'/0/i (for 0 < i < 5 or so) path and compare with the known address.\n. An alternative flow would be to include a \"MAX\" button on the keypad view and have it write the word \"MAX\" instead of a specific amount. On the next step, the actual max amount could be displayed depending on the currently selected wallet.\n. FYI, addresses starting with m and n are testnet addresses. If your wallet is P2PKH on livenet, your addresses should start with a 1.\n. ACK\n. An alternative to BWS going down would be to also have the raw tx sent by email to your trusted recipient along with instructions to broadcast it.\n. To recreate all addresses in a m-of-n wallet you need all n extended public keys. Once you have the addresses, you can build a tx using the corresponding UTXOs. The transaction will then need to be signed by m private keys.\nIf you have all 3 recovery phrases then you have all the info you need to regain access to the funds in your 2-of-3 wallet.\nIf all you have is 2 recovery phrases (i.e. 2 extended private keys & 2 extended public keys), you need to get the 3rd xpubkey from somewhere. This is where access to the server that hosts the wallet can help as the server holds all xpubkeys.\nAn alternative method is having an export of the wallet (which also has all the xpubkeys) + 2 xpriv keys.\nAgain, if you have all 3 recovery phrases, there is no need for any external piece of data.\nHope this helps.. I'm not sure about calling it \"security password\". It could be argued that all passwords are meant for security one way or another. I think we could call it something like \"wallet password\" and state that \"this password is used to protect all sensitive information (private keys, menmonics, etc) and actions (spending, exporting, etc) associated with the wallet\".. Just to clarify:\n\nimport BIP 39 seed with m/44'/0'/0'\n\nDo you really mean creating a new wallet specifying the seed?\n\nDelete it because it was an error\n\nWhat do you mean by this? What kind of error? Were you expecting funds based on that seed+path but found 0 balance?. The xpub still exists in the server (the xpriv was removed from your device). Try Add Wallet -> Import instead.\nEdit: reading the whole thread again I realize this may not be the answer you are looking for. But as @dabura667 said, you only need to provide the path to the xpub which is m/44'/0'/0'. I don't understand why you consider this to be an error. Could you please clarify why you are trying to derive using a different path?. Hi. Does the .aes.json file belong to a different copayer than the one you have on your remaining Pc?. Hi. \nTo import on your desktop pc: go to Add Wallet -> Import wallet and enter your recovery phrase (12 words).\nTo import on your phone: from your desktop go to Settings -> (Select wallet) -> More options -> Export wallet -> Select QR Code. Then from your phone go to Add Wallet -> Import wallet and scan using the camera icon at the right side of the screen.\nYou can import on as many devices as you wish and the wallet will always be in sync.. You do own the private key. With Copay you are the only one in control of your funds. Your private key never leaves your device. As long as you keep the 12 words you are safe. . Has this been resolved? @seekr @samuelt33 @vinicius03  @sulliwane @Ahmed18 . @vinicius03 have you tried deriving m/45' and see if it matches the XPubKey?. @vinicius03 could you try with just m/45' and see if the resulting extended public key (Derived Public Key field on bip32.org) matches the XPubKey field in the decrypted Copay export?. Addresses for that version of Copay used to be P2SH IIRC, they start with a '3' as opposed to P2PKH addresses which start with a '1'. If your addresses start with a 3, please try using this tool to generate the first address: https://bitcore.io/playground/#/multisig. We are working on releasing an upgrade to the Wallet recovery tool to allow moving out all BCH from Copay & BitPay App wallets. There is no ETA yet but a beta release should be available soon. Will keep you posted.. Forget python for a second. Could you grab your notebook and identify the words 1 by 1 using this list https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt ? Tell us how many are in there.. Please note that this calculation only works if every single word part exists in the BIP39 list. You should make sure of that. Or maybe change the script so that if 0 matches are found, all 2048 words are added to the list of candidates.. ACK. Copay is open source so in the extremely unlikely event that you lose your app and the recovery tool disappears, at least someone can have access to the source code.\nAlso for your peace of mind, Copay's private keys are generated following Bitcoin standards BIP32, BIP44 and BIP39 which are all well documented and with multiple implementations available.. Not every wallet out there implements those standards. From those that do implement them, there are still some small differences. For example Breadwallet being an HD wallet (BIP32) which generates 12 words for you (BIP39) does not follow the path structure for key derivation specified in BIP44. So if you try to import your 12 words from Breadwallet into Copay, you will end up with a brand new wallet and 0 balance.. Yes, exactly.. Yes, you can generate an encrypted backup file from Settings -> [your wallet] -> More options -> Export wallet. If your password is strong enough you can even save a copy on the cloud.. I think your case is a good one for VIA BTC's transaction accelerator. It works on transactions with a minimum of 0.0001 BTC/kB. The trick would be to gain access to your funds from a wallet that allows you to set your fee manually.. Hi.\nThe first issue (wrong balance, wrong tx amount) is due to the lack of look-ahead. We do not recommend using the same keys in Copay and other software simultaneously (there could be issues with address look-ahead also form receiving addresses).\nThe second issue (correct balance, still wrong tx amount) could be due to a client-side caching of the tx. Once txs have 6+ confirmations they are cached locally to prevent unnecessary roundtrips (taking advantage of the assumption that Copay is the sole owner of the keys).\n\nBut even so, when address 0 is used, but the change address lookahead still isn't trying to look at /1/....Or am I dreaming?\n\nI'm not sure I follow. Could you please clarify what you mean by this?\nThanks!\n. 'inception' ;)\n. Will change it thanks for the tip :)\n. The idea is to call this method from updateTx (called from the Send and History tabs). The problem is that updateBalance is not always called before this method. This means I would have to cache the unspent list whenever updateBalance is called and use this cached value from within updateTx. Does this sound like an acceptable solution?\n. I think line 33 should be \n{{totalBalance || 0 |noFractionNumber}} {{$root.wallet.settings.unitName}} \ninstead.\n. It is not checking against the value. alternativeBalanceAvailable is a flag set to true when the rate service is available and it is independent of the actual amount.\n. I can confirm the _.debounce was added to avoid frequent calls to this previously expensive method.\n. Why return at this point? Are the following 3 lines not needed if a callback was passed to the deleteWallet function?\n. I think you should use Wallet#getTransactionHistory without parameters so you can bypass the pagination filter. Otherwise, it is only downloading the current page.\n. If this code is not needed it should be removed. If it is needed, it should be uncommented...\n. does chrome.storage.local support .length()?\n. shouldn't use asynchronous .getItem() ?\n. same as above with .length() method\n. please remove console.log calls and/or use proper logging\n. small typo here \"walelt\"\n. wat?\n. this should be \"should not store profile when out of sync\" or something along those lines\n. I don't think this \"proves\" wallets were opened. This array is filled by calling the #addWallet method\n. I think 'han transcurrido' would be better here\n. I think ng-minlength & ng-maxlength are used to check string length. Are you looking for ng-min & ng-max?\n. I get that this is supposed to be a rare event but maybe we can have better error communication with the user?\n. If strings such as message contain commas, the whole file would be malformed.\n. Oh I see the formatString function takes care of this. My bad.\n. I think we should assess how intuitive the concept of \"spending unconfirmed transactions\" is to the end user. Maybe we should change it to \"spend unconfirmed funds\"?\n. One last comment, could you please not capitalize every word. I think \"Use unconfirmed funds\" is easier to read.\n. Same here with \"advanced\" instead of \"Advanced\"\n. both the comment and the second condition should be removed\n. e.path also starts with m/ so you should probably get rid of that first.\n. Where is c defined?\n. duplicated code\n. just pass the cb arg to the configService.set method\n. Please, use a single numeric variable self.step and redefine the goToStepN() function to accept N as an argument.\n. it's safer to check for !_lodash.isNumber(feePerKb) as this will also take care of undefined\n. opts.excludeUnconfirmedUtxos should be a boolean variable. So doing opts.excludeUnconfirmedUtxos = !config.wallet.spendUnconfirmed should be ok.\n. should be opts.returnInputs = true;\n. Why? If amount > 0 it means there are funds to build the tx.\nAlso, here we should handle the scenario where amount > 0 && amount < total_balance. This means not all funds are transferrable. There are two possible non-exclusive causes for this:\n- There are UTXOs which cannot be included in the tx at the current fee/kb rate.\n- There are too many UTXOs for a single tx.\n  Check out these variables in the response: utxosBelowFee, amountBelowFee, utxosAboveMaxSize and amountAboveMaxSize.\n. Why is index.totalBytesToSendMax arg needed?\n. Just use the availableBalanceSat received into this function. No need to do calculations involving fee or fee per kb.\n. This line should be the first line in the callback function to avoid repetition.\n. This check can be done before calling getSendMaxInfo() and should be performed before checking resp.amount.\n. Warning is too strong. What about this:\nNote: a total of XXX were excluded. These funds come from UTXOs smaller than the network fee provided.\n. Note: a total of XXX were excluded. The maximum size allowed for a transaction was exceeded.\n. Also, will this not override the previous message in case both conditions are true?\n. you dropped an x:)\n. you should use gettext for this string instead of a translate filter in the view.\n. This is kind of error prone. It shouldn't break if tag_name does not have the form vX.X.X.\n. This should be a non-public function.\n. should be /^v?\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$/i (untested) to catch tags like v1.23.456\n. This works now because of the arbitrary restriction of single digit version numbers. It needs to contemplate version numbers as three integers not just single digits.\n. Sorry, this is not correct. What about 11.0.0 vs 1.20.0? 110 < 120... \n. What if the server returns more than 3 levels?\n. This is not right. Take a look at https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/src/js/controllers/walletHome.js#L611\nThe nb of decimal places is dependent on the selected unit.\n. > This set of words (also called \"seed\") fully contains your bitcoins by reconstructing the private key without any contact with a distant server (as specified in the BIP39 Standard)\nMaybe keep it simple and direct:\n\"These 12 words are all you will ever need to gain access to your bitcoins.\"\nIMO if you call it seed maybe you need to explain yourself but not the other way around as power users already know what we are talking about.\n. Calling the seed \"recovery phrase\" makes the term \"passphrase\" somewhat confusing... I don't see how we can improve the wordings. Also \"mnemonic\" is mentioned here out of the blue...\n. I know this inconsistency existed before but maybe we need to stick with \"recovery phrase\" and remove all references to \"recovery words\"?\n. I think \"for audit purposes\" is a better description.\n. Should be \"Single address wallet\"\n. Good catch.\n. > Before receiving funds, it is necessary backup your wallet.\nShould be \"Before receiving funds, it is necessary to backup your wallet.\"\n. Should be either \"From\" or \"In\".\n. 'Extracting wallet information...'\n. do not use else, instead do if (err) return setError(....\n. use lowercase p\n. Replace magic numbers with constants defined at the start of the controller.\n. See above.\n. replace with return regex.test(val); (untested)\n. same as above.\n. This code is repeated, it should be extracted in an internal method.\n. Does this test need to be here? It seems just slicing the last char and calling processAmount() should achieve the same result.\n. using !_.isFinite()  is cleaner.\n. Where is $scope.address defined/used?\n. Why is this done when unitName == 'bits'? Also, it seems specificAmountBtc is not used. Is this dead code?\n. In this case, $scope.globalResult should be computed based on $scope.amountResult and $scope.alternativeResult which are already formatted.\n. Shouldn't status. totalBalanceAlternative also be shown in case status.pendingAmount is > 0?\n. Why assume an error means insufficient funds?. Add a '.' at the end.. Remove '.' at the beginning.. Add '.' at the end.. Why not use setWallet(wallet)?. Watch out for rounding errors.. It is better to include the argument inside the string so translators can do a better job.. Since you already have $scope.wallet why not just use its index as the argument to setWallet() and drop the findWallet() fn?. Even better: accept a wallet object as the argument to setWallet(). What would happen if $scope.walletAddrs[$scope.wallet.id].addr was undefined? I think you should reset $scope.addr first.. This looks better but the view is still using this function passing the wallet index: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/www/views/tab-receive.html#L80. Why use a $scope var for this? Where is it needed?. All outputs should be checked, not just the first one.. This service should be called BlockExplorerService or something along those lines. Refactor as a single function for each block explorer.. Pass the txId as an argument to the getTxParams fn.. According to the following truth table (c=confirmed, f=found, m=match):\nc f m msg\n========================\n0 0 0 Warning not found\n0 0 1 -\n0 1 0 Could not be verified\n0 1 1 Ok\n1 0 0 Could not be verified\n1 0 1 -\n1 1 0 Could not be verified\n1 1 1 Ok\nThe resulting expression is:\n!confirmed && !found -> Warning\nelse \n(confirmed && !found) || !match -> Could not verify.

I've investigated this issue and tried a few hacks, unfortunately i couldn't solve it, i've found this answer on SO about MobileSafari:\n\"MobileSafari will usually not download files, even if instructed to in an HTTP header. For example, it's impossible to download an MP3 from a website in MobileSafari, it's just going to play it.

I think this pattern should be abstracted away and could be useful to, for example, get notified as soon as we have an updated balance.\nThe timeout is 1 ms because I seem to remember that firefox (or another browser, maybe IE) has an issue with setting up a callback with 0 ms. It's a pattern to avoid a deeper call stack and make the call asynchronous (in node you use process.nextTick()).\n. Roger that. It should be the responsability of the user to check for the isAvailable property or use whenAvailable, and now that I think of it, it would be better to fail with noise.\n.

Can we just use satoshis here?\n. +1, this made my planning for the afternoon obsolete\n. Why not just iterate through: tx.selectedUtxos, and extract the address from the utxo?\n. This was just because it took too long (in CPU power) to retrieve a list of the transaction proposals. As discussed with @cmgustavo, there was really no reason for this to be.\n. So, as long as I've seen, the .vanilla is populated as the object is being rebuilt, so it should be safe. I'd consider adding a new function if I see other uses for this, otherwise, I prefer to keep this change as small as possible (maybe another PR?)\n. The functionality is slightly different, as I'm being hopeful that self.publicKeyRing.addressToPath will be always up to date (it should be the case, as it's rebuilt each time an index message gets read).\n.

The computer pass would be saved in the servers but the users pass would not. Is this secure?

I see this is on the iPhone app, however I can confirm that this also happens on macOS SIerra 10.12.2 with v.1.2.0. Sorry for the slow reply. I have not been using the app lately. I just downloaded and ran the new app, and all the problems appear to be fixed. Thanks!. could it be that the bitpay api has changed? i do not get a signatures property in the /publish call. i found another issue #3991 which is the exact same but closed...but the issue is definitely still open...i could also not fix it with the suggestions in that issue. the web based client you can download...the error is in all apps i used (also the android version)\nand i guess the error would be even in an ios client...because the app is not the problem, the server is...there is no response ..\n\"when sending there are signatures wanted from the bws server...but there are no signatures sent within the process...so the issue looks to be on bws side not the client\"\nat the /signatures call i get a {\"code\":\"BAD_SIGNATURES\",\"message\":\"Bad signatures\"} response\n. no...in my opinion they robbed the coins...either by accident or on purpose...you would need access to that proprietary api they are using to search through the tables to find a corresponding key or anything like that...without that i see no chance...i would be really surprised if anyone can solve this issue with the given code alone. @matiu it is a nodejs app...you can run that anywhere where node is installed...it is clearly stated you can test the app in a browser in the readme.md. i tried to figure out what the actual problem was by running it through a webbrowser...as far as i understand i could just login from another device as long as my pw and everything is correct or not? are there no new keys generated then? anyway...we tried from the actual phone where app was used without any progress nor real help from you...the original owner of the phone opened a bugreport which got closed unresolved and every once in a while you try to make people who are still not giving up their coins feel like it is their fault that they cannot access their coins...in my opinion this app should not be used by anyone at all.... #3991 tried that numerous times...coins are in the wallet...sending them to another wallet is not possible\n4266 was the original issue ...closed without resolving.... as already stated in #3991 that there was no custom rom used...galaxy s6...original software. my guess is there was a bug with key generation or an api change.... the wallet was created on an samsung s6...android ...i just tried to get access/recover from a windows10...after we figured that it is not working on the s6...\nlook i get you want your coins back...we want them too...but as long as the copay guys don't seriously cooperate you just waste your time....

Yes, that is where the trouble lies. The people I have been dealing with at the merchant do not seem to know the name of their processing company or how to initiate a refund. This morning I am attempting to work up their chain to get to someone who has some knowledge.  \"Customer Service\" is their first priority, ha, perhaps training their help might be first.\nThank you for your response, I'll post any progress. . Ha, great information. A few minutes ago, the merchant cut and pasted information from their processor.\nI signed on to the site, Coinpayments.com, got a link for a refund, put in an address for my wallet, five min later I had my funds back.\nSimply a case of the customer service person not knowing what BTC exchange is. I am just learning myself, but am not in a \"service\" position.  THANK YOU for your time and knowledge, I'm grateful and pleased to have my funds rescued.. Where can I see the transaction ID? Thanks. Yes I have what I bought on Coinbase but not in my personal wallet on Copay. I transferred all of my bitcoins to Coinbase for now until there's a solution for it.\nThanks!. @JDonadio I've set it to GBP but all currency related information on the program is still in USD. http://i.imgur.com/MQOF5ul.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tTmxrED.png. \n\nSo I bought an 160$ gift card but screenshot is 150$ because bitcoin price dropped and as you can see the gift card is not there in the app.. https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/13271a6f6dc6cd43a4f93ec4ba6b5cc64f94b3836d46cfc64808dc85a722ca90.

Current official exchange rate is $4648 per BTC (Coinbase). When I multiply this with the BTC showing in my Copay BTC balance, the figure I get is significantly higher than the amount in my Copay dollar balance. (Copay seems to use a lower exchange rate of approx $4521 per BTC which is significantly lower than actual exchange rate). Does that make sense?. ok thanks. Also am having an issue . Why can't I spend my coins also why do u take so many coins like this when sending a transaction like why do u hold my 80$ and only leave 1$ for immediate spending??. Have scanned address for coins same thing. It says 79$ with less than 1 confirmation and still not confirming . Also the transaction i sent 12 hrs ago keeps refreshing saying I \"sent a few seconds ago\" after it say sent \"a few minutes ago\" recurringly . Wallet id 735c55fb-53a0-468a-8847-5ea064679c35. So how does copay say I have 7$ available to spend if it doesn't recognize it. Also balence appears but not spendable . [verified]. What do u mean wallet status are my funds being held after 6+ confirmations . I had my last transaction confirm over 6 times in my wallet but the funds now aren't showing up. What's wrong with this I don't see a transaction for any besides what I spent and coins just disappear makes no sense. Yet I paid a decent fee today and my transaction was never broadcasted why is thiz. I sent from a copay wallet and was given an error that I transaction was not found . my both wallet - on win desktop and on mobile android have too same problem.. ii. The app should have smart address to exchange directly to them, that way\nthere is no middle man getting the exchange fee and the withdraw fee, is\nunnecessary to have exchange websites sense wallets can directly do this.\n\nOn Fri, Jul 20, 2018, 7:18 AM BGalliotti notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello @fernysalaz https://github.com/fernysalaz\nThanks for reaching out to us.\nCould you specify what your issue is, and how can we help you?\nIs your issue related to Copay/Bitpay app?\nPlease let us know if you have any additional questions.\nKind regards.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/8894#issuecomment-406614384, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AinZSJMNIam0Tgyjwcw-PmjnRhw_ZzBLks5uIeahgaJpZM4VXr8P\n.\n. i go to Transaction history then i clear the cache then it work good\n.

Running latest version today I rarely see the lockup but the backup verification process is still broken. After selecting the words in the proper order it fails with \"Failed to verify private key\". Using the same words to import on the desktop version fails with \"Could not import: Wallet not registered at Wallet Service\" despite the wallet being created without issues on the phones.\nI've checked that both the phones and desktop verstion list the same server url and same derivation path.\nUpdating the desktop version to the latest (1.9.4) and retrying to import gives another error: \"Could not import: Not Authorized\".\n. Making a wallet from the phones and using the desktop version as a copayer creates fine as well, and the desktop version can backup and verify the backup properly but the phones fail to verify the backups.\n. @thephez, @JDonadio:\nThanks for commenting, but I'm convinced this is not a testnet wallet for many reasons. For exampe, it works just fine to import the seed words into the desktop version as well as the mobile version of copay on a different phone model.\n@matiu:\nWhile we still have two W6610 phones in my household, the money has been moved over we are no longer relying on those phones to handle our funds and I believe there is no more that can be done to solve this issue at the moment. I feel safe knowing that even if the phone cannot verify the backups, I can verify and use them on the desktop or other phone versions and the phones can still spend (the part that multisig is there for) even though they refuse to show the QR's on the recieve tab.\nThis bug can be closed as wont-fix or similar, as I will soon no longer be able to provide more defails (not using the phones). One quick idea I'll drop here is a setting for allowing it to show the recieve tab and allowing it to remove the seed words even if the phone does not have the backup status set, as that would allow me to completely 100% work around the issue.\nThanks for all the attention, and keep doing the good work, I still use copay as my primary and only wallet - it has everything I need in a convenient package :)\n.

It's a rarity that I have to worry about sending out multiple payments in rapid succession, but when it does happen, Copay make's it a chore...\nSend to multiple people on the roadmap? (Another way of remedying the situation I faced)\n. I'm guessing preparations are moving forward for an update to Android and iPhone?\nI am hoping localized appstore descriptions can be added. Thanks.\n. Yeah, no wallet stores historical USD prices... That always shocked me.\nHaving one column with value at time of send and one column with value at time of CSV output would make everyone's life soooooo much easier.\n. \\n will add a linebreak\n. ex. \"This is the first line.\\nAnd this is the second line.\"\n. https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request\n. I noticed that the Crowdin is closed on invite basis.\nI find that more translations get done if you just open it to anyone with a Crowdin account. Since each language has its own activity history, each language \"leader\" (or whatever you want to call it) will be able to see if someone is trying to change translations and sock-puppet their votes to the top or something.\nAlso, I think opening the \"Add Term\" function in the terminology should be open to anyone as well. I have never seen abuse of it, and having terms set up will allow users to notify later translators of how certain words are translated.\nSo to recap my suggestion:\n1. Open up translating to all\n2. Open up \"Add Term\" to all\n. I just made it so that:\n1. it only modifies files which are shown to have translations in them.\n2. it also removes the e-mail address of the crowdin account that crowdin adds.in Last-Translator I figure not many people want to give that out. (Though you can find it on crowdin if you look hard enough.)\n. Now we just need to make sure not to enable two regions of a single language. (I went through crowdin and made sure of this.)\n. I forgot to include - and _ in possible email, so I made the regex just be 1 space, 1 less than, at least one of any character, then @ then at least one of any character then . then one of any character then greater than.\nThis should catch any e-mail address at all.\n. Ok, I think I'm done here, but I keep wondering how much I should cover in this PR.\nCurrently merging will merge the most recent translations as well as add the new languages to the app.\nIf you think I should add something else to this PR or cleanup so that only the scripts are merged, or something like that, please let me know.\n.

Fixed the compiler and also an issue where if appstore and update info English files don't exist there is nothing to compare to remove the untranslated files, so it would fail and all locale files (including po) would remain (including untranslated)\nIf there was a way to download the source files from crowdin, I would download and compare to local copy, just in case, but there is no such api.\nBecause of this, one thing must be remembered:\n1. If you change appstore_en or updateinfo_en, please perform crowdin_update.js before doing another crowdin_download.js, otherwise all of that file will show up as \"translated.\"\n. Imagine an escrow service that would hold a third key for companies.\nThe escrow, currently, would need to be entrusted with the ability to view all finances, but wouldn't it be nice if a third party could just agree \"I will press sign only when it comes through Copay, and I will verify the hash with you over the phone to verify.\"\nIt seems a little weird, because it was not possible up until now. But I think this is a unique bitcoin use case.\n. Yes. You should also enable the \"Request a language\" feature. That way if they don't see their language but want to translate, then can ask to add it.\n. Here's an example of the best (in my opinion) setting for the project.\n\n. The problem I am trying to fix with this is that iOS app and Android app have the \"Confirm\" \"Are you sure you want to delete wallet?\" in English.\nKind of important that the user understands what this means. :-)\nI rebased and restructured to make the localization its own string variable, then just use that.\n. Hmm... well, I can't figure it out... so I will close this PR and make it an issue instead.\n. ok, I will do it in a few hours or less.\n. Or maybe use the upper right corner (in the topbar) of the language setting page as a place for a link to such a page.\n. LGTM ACK\n. #### Slightly off topic, just want to point out some falacy:\n\nSIMPLE UI DESIGN and human interface and interaction level\n\nYou realize that your entire request is to make the transaction process MORE COMPLICATED.\nLike, not a subjective opinion, you are literally asking to increase the number of things any user needs to worry about, which is the definition of complexity.\n\"I want this complex feature, but make it simple. You guys suck at simple, sheesh!\"\nYou want to make a complex app? Because that's how you make a complex app... paving the way with good intentions.\n. @XBTdev I knew it was probably a new thing in cordova, but was too lazy to actually look at cordova.\nThanks @matiu, problem solved.\n@XBTdev does this answer satisfy you?\nIt is required by the new e-mail composer plugin that is used by cordova (and since Copay uses cordova, and Copay composes e-mails (in the share button for invite code etc)).\nThis was added to cordova 3 days after 1.1.2 released of Copay, which is why it is only starting in 1.1.3.\n. > monkey patch it\nSo build > manually change permissions from built app > check to see if it breaks?\nlol, if that works then awesome.\n. Wait, lol.\nSo I just checked the plugin, and the ONLY place the accounts are used is a function to check whether you have an e-mail app installed or not.\nWorst case scenario is that someone doesn't have e-mail and Copay explodes into a supernova... (aka it will never happen :-P)\nI think monkey patching it will work well.\n. > expense of necessary functionality\nDisagreement. Ability to input custom fees and view all addresses is not necessary.\nI understand the thought process, I used to run QT when it was the only viable wallet and making periodic backups and managing addresses for tax purposes etc.. times have changed.\nYou seem technically apt. Fork Copay. It's just a UI interface to angular-bitcore-wallet-client.\nHeck, make your own UI for bwc and you can even support multiple outputs too (available in bwc) :-)\n.

    "mcelrath": "Request: in the \"Send Proposal\" screen, show the recipient's addressbook name, rather than just their BTC address.\n. Aaah it locks the UTXO, and since my wallet was funded from a single transaction, the entire balance got locked.\nThat's rather unfortunate.  But I don't see a way around it.\n. A UI Improvement is definitely in order.  It is a rather technical point however: \"Your funds of X BTC are locked because that is the size of the input transaction being spent\".  This requires some level of understanding about UTXO's that is probably beyond what can be expected of an average wallet user.\nPipe dream, but finding a way to only lock the amount being spent would be really neat.\nIn my case, I wanted to issue multiple payments.  (see #2228) So trying to do one at a time, and get my copayer to get online and sign them one at a time, was a pain in the ass.  This should have been possible in a single transaction (and a single proposal).  However, there are other use cases where a user will be confused why his entire balance is locked.\n. How are transactions broadcast to the copayer?  They're not on the blockchain so certainly I can withdraw a proposed transaction before a copayer has seen it?\n. This was using whatever you guys had running on copay.io about 3 days ago.   Good to know it's fixed!  I still have a 2-of-2 wallet with bitcoins in it that I need to recover due to this bug (have all master keys though).  If you have a few minutes, I'd appreciate a chat and some hints as to how to go about rejoining the wallet for 1 of the 2 copayers.  You can find me on skype as 'mcelrath'.  Thanks!\nI'll check and see if I can reproduce the bug with 0.9.2.\n. Thanks!  But there seems to be something wrong with this script:\nTOTAL BALANCE: 0 SATOSHIS\nBalance per address: {}\nCould not find any coins in the generated wallet\nAlso, TxProposals.js needs: var _ = require('underscore')\n. I'm using 0.9.2, and have no spaces.  Tried both orders of the keys too, in case it matters.  (does it?)\n. One of the two keys is the \"Master Private Key\" from the 1-of-1 \"my wallet\" wallet, since Insight lost the shared wallet for that account.  The second account has the 2-of-2 wallet and I just noticed that it has a different master private key than the \"my wallet\" account.\nAre the privkeys from shared wallets derived from the master privkey of the \"my wallet\"?\n. If the 2-of-2 keys are independent, then they are impossible to recover, because it seems your Insight server did not store them. :-(  The account no longer shows the wallet (which was successfully joined before).\nUnless it is present somewhere on your server...\n. We did solve it, and it seems the bug was fixed sometime with 0.9.2.\n. Using a hardened derivation for each sub-wallet for a single user does not compromise security, but substantially improves recovery options. +1\n.

Theres another issue with that error message, its defined as:\njavascript\n if (msg.match('totalNeededAmount') || msg.match('unspent not set'))\nmsg = 'Insufficient funds'\nHowever, i think you should split those errors into 2 different error messages like \n``` javascript\n      if (msg.match('unspent not set'))\n        msg = 'Unspent outputs not set, it might also be that the amount you try to transfer is too small or only Dust inputs are left in your Wallet';\n  if (msg.match('totalNeededAmount'))\n    msg = 'Insufficient funds, keep in mind you have to pay a transaction fee.';\n\n```\nThe unspent not sent can also be caused by having only dust in the wallet, i had like 100 * 0.0001 btc and couldnt send it out - it displayed only insuffienct funds but the real error was that all inputs were dust.\n.

As i said i added those directives in my local code, if i didn\u00b4t then restarting the app wouldnt have helped either ;)\nso to make it short, this does not work, only if the app gets restarted: Lock \nbut this works, without restarting the app, as it should be: {{'string'|translate}}.\n\"But there is something I don't understand, when you save your settings, the app reload all variables and functions. So, why you need to restart the app to see the strings translated?\"\nThats the reason why i opened the Issue, because i don\u00b4t understand that either. The translations work absolutely fine everywhere else in the App.\nAnd the directive and the annoted brackets are afaik not the same.\nThe translate directive will place a watcher on the passed variable. So the translation will only apply, when the passed value does actually change? \nThe brackets use a filter instead of a directive and will be dirty checked and refreshed in every $digest, even if it's not necessary. \nAnd thats the reason why i thought it might be some kind of init problem as the filter bracket version works and the strings get translated whenever i open the sidebar \"on-the-fly\".\n. definately - the same as on the pin page is ok, instead of the lock button a decimal point should work.\nI am just not sure if a comma is also needed, people here in europe and other regions use a comma instead - maybe just add both signs on the same button? \n.

Where we differ is we want to utilize technology that is deployed today such that we use the power of DNS deployment across the internet for redundancy, reliability, and scale. DNSSEC is the mechanism to ensure the chain of trust. Our belief is that lookups should be powered by the existing DNS infrastructure at large. We plan to include other established open protocols into our products to enhance user privacy and will update our open source offerings. \nWe are going to drop this pull request and resubmit as an optional Bitcore plugin so that folks who would like to use this service have that option.\n.

For now, you can tell them apart by \"copay\" vs \"Copay\". The osx app should be all lowercase.\n\n. Yes, this would apply to passphrase protected wallets. Or to a app-pin-code if that feature is added.\nHonestly, I'd much prefer the Stealth Wallet #3030 feature... but I thought for the sake of discussion I'd see what people's thoughts were on wallet self-destruct.\n. You could make it very clean and still display countervalue. At the very least, it needs to be displayed on the password prompt screen as a confirmation.\nImaging trying to send 93232334 bits and sending 932323234 instead. The USD value is never displayed so you could easily make such a mistake.\nWhat do you think of displaying the amount (in BTC & USD) on the confirmation modal?\n. Yes, I'm running Android M.

No. It says the password he remembers for his backup is incorrect. We've tried anything we can think of.\nAny way to make the app work? The wallet wasn't encrypted on the phone itself, so if the app worked we'd be able to send the funds.\n. This is the backup json format: {\"iv\":\"redacted\",\"v\":1,\"iter\":10000,\"ks\":128,\"ts\":64,\"mode\":\"ccm\",\"adata\":\"\",\"cipher\":\"aes\",\"salt\":\"redacted\",\"ct\":\"redacted\"}\nI can privately send you the entire backup json if you would like.\nBut it looks like his backup was made after your new backup format (0.10), right?\nEdit: just checked the date when he installed copay and created the backup (email timestamp) and it was July 16, 2015. Looks like v1.1.1 was the active release at the time. So way after #1519 was fixed, but the issue is the same as described in that bug report.\n. By the way, he is currently running Android 4.4.2 on an LG Volt.\n. There isn't any way to extract the wallet data file from the device with a file explorer? I know you use the device id to salt the local file, but I could access that. The wallet on the device is not encrypted with a password so it seems like the only way to access it.\nIf it can't be accessed by a file explorer, maybe we could create an apk build that just dumps a plaintext copy of the wallet data.\nWhere on the phone filesystem are the wallet keys?\n. Took a look at the code...\nIf I had an APK that would dump the results of storage.get('profile') and var getUUID to the screen or to a file.... then I could install this apk, run it, and the only thing encrypting the data would be the UUID which I have.\nThoughts?\n. I'm checking with a file explorer app and /sdcard/Android/data/com.bitpay.copay/files/ appears to be empty. Is this where I should see a data file?\nEdit: checked on my phone with working copay install and same path is empty, so I guess thats normal :)\n. > > Would be interesting if all wallets in the app had the same backup phrase and just used the accounts index of BIP44 to differentiate.\n\nyeap... thats the plan eventually :)\n\nWow! Awesome! That is great to hear. I introduced issue #3055 suggesting this.... this would be my number 1 most important feature request. If I want to create a sub-account for some unique purpose its annoying having to track a separate backup and go through the trouble of making multiple cold storage copies.\nI do think it is important that you could still create completely separate accounts. But for most purposes, I'd create a sub-account.\n\n\n. My friend had the same issue #3173 and we didn't ever figure it out. My friend has since passed away from lung cancer, and he only had 0.2 btc in his wallet which I had given him. He couldn't remember his password before he passed away, but I guess you can't take it with you anyhow.\n. Yes, there are workarounds. You can use recovery tool to extract private keys from backup file, or from seed. Then you could import those keys into Bitcoin Core, Electrum, or any other wallet that supports signing.\nJust created an issue to suggest that coinb.in add this to their browser tool: https://github.com/OutCast3k/coinbin/issues/38\nalso check this repo https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-message\nGiven that its only 4 lines of code to sign a message, I don't see much reason not to add this functionality into copay\nvar bitcore = require('bitcore-lib');\nvar Message = require('bitcore-message');\nvar privateKey = bitcore.PrivateKey.fromWIF('cPBn5A4ikZvBTQ8D7NnvHZYCAxzDZ5Z2TSGW2LkyPiLxqYaJPBW4');\nvar signature = Message('hello, world').sign(privateKey);\n. This is the recovery tool: http://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/\nYou can input your seed (for newer backups), or the backup file and password (older backup format) and it will generate the private keys for you.\nThen you can import them into Electrum or Core or some wallet that supports message signing.\n. Try exporting the wallet json again from Settings > Advanced > Export Wallet \nThe recovery tool will require two passwords. The export password, and the spending password. You'll need to enter both to decrypt your private keys.\nAlso, I would highly recommend moving all funds to a new copay wallet that uses the new backup format (a seed instead of json file).\n. Update: found this and it works well https://github.com/weex/bitcoin-signature-tool\n. I mentioned the issue in #4003, but it's good to have a separate issue for this as that issue is focused on the Android N errors\n. > Hi @XBTdev, please try to generate new addresses and check if the problems remains.\nThat worked. Thanks.\nI can close this issue if you want... or I can leave it open if you want to actually solve the issue in the code :)\n. ",

We would have to mitigate it with documentation or possibly even a verification step (like services do with ACH accounts by verifying they can receive a few cents and report how much was sent).\n. Yeah, maybe I do not understand how the multisig addresses are being generated.  Since the wallet supported importing a BIP32 key to create a wallet, I figured it would generate addresses similar to non-multisig wallets and use the scan/lookahead method for detecting payments.  If this is not the case, then it would probably require waiting until a feature that @matiu mentioned is supported.\n. @matiu See here: https://www.theprotocol.tv/bobby-lee-btc-china/  We are powering the paywall over the video.  When a user visits the page, we generate a payment address based on TheProtocol.tv's xPub on our servers that will send the payments directly to TheProtocol.tv's bitcoin wallet.  PopChest.com is powering it, but never actually is in control of the money.  Our problem is that we can't find a wallet that we can recommend to use that is A) Cross platform and B) Exposes an xPub the user can input into our site.\nYeah, I understand the problem with missing/combinations of multisig xPubs.  \nIf Copay doesn't support the lookahead feature to scan for incoming transactions for addresses itself has not generated, then this use case can't really be supported.  I see my incorrect assumptions about how the wallet works caused some confusion.  You can close this request from me, unless you think exposing the xPub for other use cases makes sense.\n.

It would be very useful for accounting purposes if the CSV download includes a column for the USD (local currency) equivalent amount at the time of the transaction.   Please consider adding this.\n. Yes, ideally the wallet would support the following workflow:\n1) non-signing user creates transaction proposals.\n2) Copayer(s) receive some type of message upon login that there are pending transactions to review.\n3) Copayer(s) can either approve or disapprove.    If not enough approve, the transaction is moved to some sort of declined state.\nI wasn't aware that this non-signing user is really an option, so was trying to shoehorn the workflow into an m of n signing model.\n. Please consider making the email notifications optional.   Not everyone wants to associate an email address with their funds and have those notifications hopping around the internet.  At the very least PGP encryption should be offered.\nFor my company's banking website with a prepare/authorize workflow, the bank does not send me (authorizer) any notification.   Rather, the preparer notifies me via internal communications channel.  Or if I happen to login to the bank's website I see a notice that there are pending transactions awaiting approval.  That is a perfectly usable workflow that maintains privacy.\n. awesome.  I'm excited to try this out as soon as I can find time -- aiming for early next week.\n. yes please!  coin control is important for users that care about privacy.\n. This is exciting guys.  If I'm not mistaken, it pretty much enables what I was asking for in issue #2971.  I will try it out at soonest opportunity.\nQuestion: is it planned (or already possible) to add a non-signing user via the UI?   Exporting a backup, sending via external channel, and then importing on the other side is a pretty klunky workflow.\n. just my $.02, fwiw.\nA popup may be ok, eg upon login or when a payment proposal first arrives.\nHowever, it should be possible to close the popup and deal with it later at one's convencience.  So the key thing is for there to be a notification link/button eg \"XX pending payments awaiting your review\" that always appears in the same location, so the user gets trained to look in that spot in case there are any.\n. yeah, that's a different thing.  makes sense to me.\n. I'm guessing that Luke is referring to this thread regarding notification addresses.\nhttp://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bitcoin.devel/11008/focus=11022\n. just a note that this is also useful for libratax, which has a \"Bulk Add Addresses\" feature in addition to CSV transaction import.\n. thanks for looking into this guys.\nI read that upcoming android M will let the user selectively disable perms and apps will just have to deal with it.  I can't wait for that.\n. This is pretty much the same as https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3109.\nThere are many use cases (needs) for this:\n1) User wishes to independently validate balance/transactions.\n2) User wishes to import addresses into a watch-only wallet, such as bitcoin-core.\n3) Importing addresses into libratax.\n4) Importing addresses into my own auditing tool  ( bitprices ) or future auditing tools.\n5) User wishes to lookup addresses on a blockchain explorer.\n6) User is writing a script or using another utility/api/service that requires wallet addresses.\n7) I'm probably not thinking of 1000 other cases.\nFundamentally though it comes down to this:  These are my addresses, representing my wealth.  Hiding them from me, the owner, is not acceptable.  It also requires that I, the user put 100% trust in the CoPay software, which I do not.   \nIn short, in your efforts to \"simplify\" and \"protect\" the user, you have effectively said \"Don't worry your pretty little head about your keys or addresses, we'll just manage them for you.  You want to see them?  too bad!\".  This disempowers the user/owner, and to my mind, is only one step away from a hosted service like coinbase that actually holds the keys.\nPresently extracting addresses out of CoPay is amongst the most laborious of any wallet I have seen.\nOne must go to history, then click on individual transaction, then click \"See it on the blockchain\" then manually determine which of the inputs/outputs correspond to our own address(es), then store those somewhere, then repeat all this for the next transaction, and so on.\nI know this because I've done it, because I've had a NEED.  It is a serious pain point.\nI am fine with it being buried under \"Advanced\" somewhere, or even as a separate utility or manually documented procedure.  But the capability needs to exist.\nThis could be easily solved with a new CSV export.\n. As stated in issue #3109, I would be satisfied with a documented process (even if only here in this issue) for how a user may manually retrieve the addresses  ( and yes, private keys also ).\nRight now, this thing feels like a car with the hood welded shut.\nok, so it's just a frontend to BWS.   Can someone PLEASE point me to documentation how to get my addresses and private keys out of BWS for wallet(s) I have created using CoPay?\nre the forking talk:  that's always a possibility.   My hope though would be that the CoPay developers realize that: \na) users of CoPay, a wallet aimed at multisig, are already going to be fairly knowledgeable about bitcoin at this stage in bitcoin's life, not necessarily complete novices.\nb) we who created and are commenting on this issue are actual users of CoPay, expressing a real need that we have, presently.\n. Oh, I was going to suggest also.  Perhaps a general way to accomodate these types of \"advanced\" requests would be to add a \"debug console\" that allows one to enter BWS queries, ala bitcoin-qt.\nI notice that the BWS API has this:\n   /v1/addresses/: Get Wallet's main addresses (does not include change addresses)\nfrom: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service\nBut I do not see any API or flag that DOES return change addresses.  Which is disappointing.  Is there really no way?\n. @matiu thanks for the readme writeup.  It is indeed tedious to extract the addresses, but at least it is a process.  I will comment again once I've actually tried it.\nAnyway, I see issue #3122 was added, so I'm happy about that.  Thanks guys!\naside:  I am on the lookout for an online tool that will accept an xPubKey and auto-generate all used addresses.  Would be an awesome addition to the bitcore playground, and would make this process bearable.\n. ",

Only the older Trezor wallet (from 1/10/2016) is experiencing an issue.\n. > Was the wallet completed in the BWS you are using before you tried to\n\nimport?\n\nYes the wallet was completed and bits were sent to a number of multi-sig addresses.  \nI tried restoring to a new machine while the other copayer had their wallet running. Trezor keys exported, and the wallet name appears. Only thing I get is the \"share this invitation with your copayers\" screen. There is no way to delete the wallet and no balance is shown.\nThe co-payer was able to share the walletID with me. Can I use that to restore?\n. The wallet was fully set up and funds were sent to it. Then I removed the copay app from my machine before upgrading to copay v1.9.4. After upgrading the wallet was gone (I assume data files were removed on uninstall). One of the cosigners still has their copy of the wallet and can see the correct balance and transactions. I cannot restore fully from the Trezor.

    "KeyJockey": "This would be okay AS LONG as there remains an option NOT to update and stick to using an older version if desired.  \nAs I've noted (extensively) elsewhere, I personally prefer to stay with the 1.1.2 version for now, until my issue https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3111 about miner fee control is improved. Seems like only on the Chrome/Win release is the updated version forced.\nOn my Macbook, in particular, I vastly prefer being able to manually update (or not) as needed.\n. OK folks, we've got IMHO a nice bounty started off on this now:\nhttps://synapsi.com/questions/manual-override-dynamic-fee-in-copay-wallet-201509252351\n \nNot sure why the badge here isn't updating: we're actually at 0.725 bitcoin so far, currently worth about $175, plus there's a little work started on it now by dabura667:  https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/3235\nSo let's hear more comments please: does anyone really believe this shouldn't be added to Copay?  Why not? IS there really any downside to allowing advanced-user manual fee setting?  I srsly can't think of anything significant enough, so really wanna see this in NEXT version, guys: all of us real-world actual users of Copay need it out here :+1: \n. Yep @vstabile -- you've seen what I said at first above, i.e. wallet leaves this annoying DUST behind, and the user can't even get it out since it's not enough for even just a new transaction's miner fee :frowning: \nI know a lot of people probably see this as a very minor issue BUT srsly for me it's annoying enough that I cannot use the (much improved, otherwise!) newest versions of Copay hardly at all.\nI'm STUCK here mostly using only version 1.1.2 which is the last release that had (IMHO) \"sensible\" fixed-fee, non-dynamic values like (industry standard) simple 0.0001 : this really needs to be a higher priority.\n. > Would you be satisfied if Copay allowed you to manually set the fee per kilobyte, even if it did not allow you to manually set the absolute fee?\nWell, that wouldn't be ideal... again, from a UI design perspective that would be making the user jump thru even more unnecessary and complicated hoops. IMHO people will just want to simply set a number, or simply adjust a number from what the wallet suggests is the \"correct\" fee value, and just click SEND, and that's what they're spending.  Bing Bang Boom, Simple Easy-Peasey, in theory LOL\nIF some fee-per-kb way is the only way to do it for advanced users, I suppose it'd be better than nothing.  But, again, really not ideal. \nThis entire issue needs to be looked at from a SIMPLE UI DESIGN and human interface and interaction level and not so much on the technicals only (which IMHO is really the real reason why you folks don't seem to GET what I'm saying about this... and why I'm having such a problem getting y'all to take this seriously here...)\n. FWIW guys... yesterday the mempool got so huge and things were all so backlogged again, and I see now there are lots of reports and complaints on the forums, reddit, etc about people's \"normal\" transactions with \"correct\" Dynamic Fee values STILL were becoming \"stuck\".\nThose may or may not have been Copay transactions, however the Dynamic Fee was determined, but point remains.  Dynamic Fee system could still get STUCK.\nPersonally, yesterday, all MY transactions sent from old version Copay with simple \"emergency\" fee setting at 0.0005 went thru okay... \"Knock On Wood\" LOL\nBUT on a day like that I'd have really liked to have been able to manually put in a deliberately \"excessive\" fee ON PURPOSE just to try and push my transaction to the front of the line, in some cases.\nSo, again, \"Wasted Money\" or not, it's still MY bitcoin to spend however I see fit.\nCopay needs to allow this.\n. OMG guys, srsly?   Is this really not fixed yet?  \"LowPrio\"...?\nIt's been, what... like two or three new version releases since I posted this?\nIt's a single character TYPO... isn't it?  How hard can this be?\nIf it IS fixed please disregard and close this issue -- I can't tell since I cannot upgrade my MAC version of Copay since I am sticking to 1.1.2 there still -- due to my  https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3111 issue about miner fee still not fixed.\n. I agree this is needed in an \"Advanced\" function... similar to my complaint about not being able to manually over-ride the new \"dynamic fee\" feature (report https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/3111 here) and I also agree with the post elsewhere (can't find it now) about needed a way to export or at least SEE the actual private keys!\nOf course it's all fine and good to have a nice simple clean UI... everyone wants software that looks nice and is \"easy to use\" -- but doing so at the expense of necessary functionality and features that users really need to have, in order to get the software to actually DO what they WANT, is totally bass-ackwards putting the cart before the horse wrong-headed thinking.\nIt's a fine line to tread, keeping the UI clean and simple but still enabling NEEDED functionality and I'm beginning to worry that Copay's design principles are heading a bit too far towards that \"hamstring the users for the sake of simple UI\" thinking.\nThis ISN'T what you guys want to be doing... believe me. Copay has a great start for a 1.0 version and is currently my favorite wallet but you guys can easily lose that if you focus too much on holding back functionality for this \"simple UI\" false justification.\nJust my 2 satoshi's opinion as a former software UI designer in a past career... FWIW\n. Hey @j32ravens  :smile_cat: good to see U here. \nVery cool that it worked, welcome to the Copay family :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n. @dabura667 hmm yeah you learn something new every day I guess.  Wasn't aware there is no such thing actually... at least not in the \"official\" bitcoin spec, huh?  Hmm.\nAnyway, FWIW it seems to me like other blockchain explorers like (ugh, yeah I know) blockchain.info manage to put in a timestamp for whenever a transaction is \"first seen\" on the network, even if it's not the official first confirmation time stamp. \nThe OP here could accomplish what he says he needs by looking at his submitted transaction via these other block explorers even if that timestamp info there isn't available directly in his Copay wallet.\nBut, IMHO anyway, would be nice to have it somehow available IN COPAY as well.\n. LOL man, well srsly what's NOT \"political\" in bitcoin these days?\nUnfortunately there is no getting around social/politics stuff, as much as we would like to avoid it.  And if SegWit isn't difficult and it's likely to be supported easily, then why NOT add Copay to this \"political list\" anyway?  NOT having our favorite wallet (and IMHO the best one) listed here on this stupid page just makes Copay look bad, somehow, compared to all the other wallets who are listing themselves.\nIt makes it look to unaware users that somehow something is \"wrong\" with Copay if it's not there.  Doesn't avoid the politics unfortunately just reflects badly on Copay :frowning: \n. Ahh, bummer.  OK well thanks for replying anyway.\n. ",

I think the text should say \"Please enter your PIN\" and \"Confirm your PIN\".  I think you should remove the nav bar. This title is not necessary. And also is wrong. Should be a title for the view, not a state.. also : btx.confirmations === 0. Ok. It's done here https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/pull/650 . This is necessary to avoid the user to go back to the previous view.. +1. $scope.tx.feeLevelStr is repeated. . Should be:  $scope.tx.feeLevelStr = feeService.feeOpts[$scope.tx.feeLevel] and remove the if. This is ok ? Fees should only show on sent transactions. +1. +1. Good catch . Maybe this array should be name as \"directives\" ? . dup. needs translate pipe. needs translate pipe. also here. this one https://github.com/bitpay/copay/pull/8485. done! thanks. Agree. I just update de PR. . item placeholder should be {{'Enter a transaction memo' | translate}} -> use npm run extract to test that the string is added to the pot file. Also here. the translate here does not work. OK ! But we have two issues in iOS, the arrow left padding and the title font weight. I will try to fix it.\n\n\n. removed.. removed. It's working in my browser version, maybe the documentation is not updated? Anyway is not necessary so I removed.. needs translation. needs translate pipe. needs translation. needs translate pipe. needs translate pipe. whole file needs translation. We need to avoid the strings to wrap, this modifies the translations strings. This translated string does not exist anymore. Yes, right. The problem here is that is not yet subscribed to the 'open-url-event' event, this takes place after the profile loaded. And we need the profile loaded and all the wallets to handle the URL correctly.. done. Thanks. I did a manual test running a script and it supports up to 5MB.. Currently, that is the easiest way to identify that the title has the auth code. But, we could plan a refactor for later.. no longer. done. removed. Done. ",

Would be nice to add L&T information there, but for now maybe a conditional to hide it will avoid the L&T users confusing or asking \"why the information is not available if I have my hardware connected\" (like me lol). Yep, security options are available for wallets which have the privkey locally not externally.

Tried using the Import shared Trezor wallet... worked like a charm!\nOne confusing thing is that with the import feature... Copay somehow remembered my modified Wallet alias... how did it do that? Does it get it from the Copay server?\n. @cmgustavo : Didn't appear when I restarted the app. In case it makes a difference, this is a wallet that I deleted and then reimported from a backup file. I am on a Windows 8.1 machine.\n@matiu : Yes, to be clear, I was not expecting addresses to be shared between copayers... this is all one one machine/copay-instance.\n. OK, I think I figured it out.\nCopay asks you to export public keys twice, but what it does the key it gets the first time is really mysterious (to the user at least). Each time it asks me to export the public key I have to enter my password, and so the first time I just type gibberish, and the second time I type my actual password.\nI THINK that Copay is using that first public key to check if I am already registered on the B?? (I always forget the acronym) server. I tried making sure that that the passphrases matched on the first public key export on both Copay instances and then it let me import my wallet on the second instance.\n. @matiu : This is still unresolved right? It's a bit unsettling! The reason I loved Copay so much was precisely because of Copay+Trezor integration... and now I'm anxious about my Bitcoin Cash!. @matiu : A step-by-step explanation of how to move BCH from a 2-of-2 Copay/Trezor wallet (even if it means importing the recovery seed) would be really really really helpful!. Could we use this? (would have to edit source code to allow 44 --> 48 for path derivation\nhttps://iancoleman.io/bip39/. My Chrome Copay \"extension\" is 3.9.9 but when I load the \"app\" and go to about it says the version is 3.9.2... also, I don't see the derivation path changing to m/48/0/0 when I click on hardware wallet in the import menu. How do I get the 3.9.9 \"app\"?. Grr, I feel like I'm close. I followed the above steps and when I hit the \"duplicate to BCH\" button... it showed my BCH balance temporarily, but now it shows a BCH balance of 0 (and no transactions). It's not possible that the txn was spent because the 2nd co-signer is still not imported (still using the trezor). Not sure what's going on.. Guys, what am I doing wrong? When Copay \"checks the balance\" of my Bitcoin Cash Wallet BEFORE I hit \"duplicate\" it shows a positive balance. AFTER I hit duplicate, it shows a zero balance and I can't spend anything. I've tried deleting the wallet and reimporting and it shows the same thing.. Sorry to spam this thread, but I feel as though my situation has become somewhat urgent... now that I've typed my recovery phrase into Copay, the funds are no longer as secure, I was hoping to send them immediately to a new secure address... but now they are stuck in a low-security situation. Please help! . OK, so, just to add a little more technical detail to what is going on, let me describe what I am doing. First of all, I am able to successfully recover BCH from a 1-of-1 wallet using the above procedure, works perfectly. For my 2-of-2 wallet, the BTC wallet shows the full transaction history, but after I click \"duplicate to BCH\" it does not show any transaction history, which is clearly a bug, because it should show all of the old transactions from before the split (there were many). So, it is somehow not duplicating to BCH correctly. \n. UPDATE!!!! - I went into the settings for the wallets and manually clicked on \"scan addresses for funds\" and finally all of the Bitcoin Cash showed up. OK, trying to sign the txn now... what a stressful today. Sorry for flooding this thread! Maybe someone else will have the same problem.. UPDATE2: Nope, still stuck. I can create a payment proposal with cosigner A, but for cosigner B I follow the exact same procedure, but when I hit the \"duplicate for BCH\" button nothing happens... a little loading animation plays for a few seconds but then disappears and the same menu is presented (i.e., I can still click on \"duplicate for BCH\" again). No Bitcoin Cash wallet is created... \nIs it a problem that both wallets use the same 24 word recovery seed but each uses a different password.?Help?. Well, the \"password\" is like a 25th word for the recovery seed. So, they each have the same first 24 words and then a different 25th word. Anyway, maybe it has caused some unintended behavior in this case. I am besides myself with anxiety right now.. Yes, both wallets are using a trezor, but they were both initialized with the same 24 word seed.\nI should point out, perhaps, that I have been using this 2-of-2 multisig copay wallet for years now for BTC transactions with no problem. Using two trezors with the same 24 word recovery seed but different password definitely works, believe me!. @johnvamo Yes, each wallet DOES have a unique private key because the private key is essentially:\nSHA256( recovery seed + password)\nSo if each wallet uses a different password, then the private keys are different. That's why the password is kind of like a 25th word for the recovery seed. Makes sense?\nI'm still stuck though for reasons I don't understand.. I don't understand how this issue can be closed. Can you please help us?. That doesn't work though, because it uses/assumes an m/44/0/0 derivation\npath, instead of the m/48-based derivation path. What am I missing?\nOn Fri, Dec 1, 2017 at 2:09 PM, Javier Donad\u00edo notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n6645 (comment)\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6645#issuecomment-346151743\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/6789#issuecomment-348586692, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACL7OyPOfVaMVr936GK56eZYacvuFbvtks5s8E7fgaJpZM4PkgQO\n.\n\n\n-- \nChris Wilmer, Ph.D.\nAsst.

After all, the keys on the HW wallet are not with the copay instance, so there is no security problem.

Thanks. Currently its not possible to use Copay. Perhaps i have to deinstall it, but then it could be that i have lost my complete wallet?\n. As i said, i wanted to create a seed backup. But precisely at this time the error occured. Since then i couldn't use the app anymore. So i decided to reinstall it. The wallets including their bitcoins where lost. Now everything is working fine, the error has not occured so far. I created new wallets incl. making a seed backup before i got coins in it.\n. ",
    "JustAHappyKid": "@dabura667 Echoing @avibrazil, this is a really excellent and concise write-up explaining how modern, HD wallets work... Would you mind if I copied, with editing, large chunks of your comment for a blog-post on our site? I'd like to keep this information handy somewhere anyway, and hopefully it will be easier for others to find if it's not hidden in a Github comment.\nAlso, am I correct in thinking that the current version of Blockchain.info's wallet uses a similar/same mechanism (BIP39 + BIP32 + BIP44), since they are now HD-based (if I understand correctly)?. FWIW, I have begun work on a proper document (blog post) making use of the content from @dabura667, explaining how modern HD wallets work and the basics of the relevant BIPs: https://spendabit.co/blog/understanding-hd-bitcoin-wallets. @westonal Take a \"chill pill\".\nFirst of all, I'm planning to edit the text to the point it only has the \"spirit\" of what @dabura667 wrote, and furthermore if he decides to take the time to respond to my question with a \"no\", then I'll rewrite the content from scratch (about half of it was already newly-written). Note also, the post is not yet public -- except here, where I posted it as an FYI/courtesy.\nNot sure I've ever seen anyone in the open-source community take so much offense to someone else copying a few paragraphs or blocks of code, especially from random comments on an issue-tracker.\n\nWell jokes on you, it's a very poor explanation.\n\nSo why didn't you chime in with a link to the better explanation (you seem to be aware of) so I didn't bother to make the above content more accessible / easier to find (as a help to others trying to understand how modern HD wallets work)?. Thanks for chiming in @dabura667. I will add an attribution. (Meant to do that in the first place.). Thanks for pointing that out @westonal. I'm linking to the original BIP documents as well (not live yet), for those that wish to dig deeper. The graphic is helpful.. Thanks for the feedback. I finally got around to putting a bow on that article. Feel free to let me know if you see any factual problems or other room for improvement; I'll try to update it appropriately. I'd love to put together some graphics as suggested, but doubt I'll find the time in the near future.. ",

But the native Linux Copay client has been broken by something in the Linux operating system, across several distros, for some time now. (It's not a copay bug per se - there was a patch deployed on several linux distros that broke Copay ability to successfully handshake ssl connections).\nBut again, you can run CoPay from the Chrome app store on a linux OS.\n. @tomtruitt You can also run your own node ( force your copay wallet to query your own Insight server for enhanced privacy). The node project is called Insight.\n.

Samsung Galaxy Note 5\n\n. \n. \n. Can confirm Google Chrome App stopped working after an upgrade. When you open the CoPay app, it just gives you a blank window.\n\n. Using Chrome Version 51.0.2704.63 (64-bit) on Fedora 23/Linux\n. Given that I had a wallet that was backed up with ~ $170 and is still not able to be recovered (#4182), your defense has no weight.\nThe likelihood of a new user depositing more than $50 their first time is not likely and an experienced user depositing more than $50 without a backup kinda needs to get what they deserve.\n. How about we meet in the middle.\nIf the wallet has not been backed up, then the receive tab will only show the \"Request a specific amount\" page where you have to enter in an amount. The interface will only allow an amount up to 50,000 bits when the wallet has not been backed up.\nThat would be a perfect compromise.\n. I generated the word lists by randomly picking my own 12 words from the wordlist. Sorry, I was not aware there was a checksum involved. So is there no way for me to pick my own 12 words from the wordlist?\n. I see there isn't a viable method for my purposes. closing. thx\n. It should be noted that XBT is only a logically derived candidate and not an official declaration from ISO 4217.\n. What about the issue where selecting the first 12 words is sufficient to continue the verification process? There should not be enough seed to pass checksum with 12 words, no?\n. #4450\nTL;DR If backup flag not set, only allow the user to specify an amount to receive that is less than a safe amount ($50?).\n. @dabura667 \nI don't know why it took me so long to realized this, but the proper solution for training a crowd of people is to use the testnet. \n1. It bypasses the backup requirement so the process of installing a usable wallet is very quick.\n2. TestNet coins are worthless so you can hand them out like candy.\n3. The network operates the same exact way and just as fast.\nHere is a testnet faucet, but if it goes down, just google 'bitcoin testnet faucet' and you'll find more.\nhttp://tpfaucet.appspot.com/\n. I imagine it to be used like a dropdown object that doesn't take up any space until pressed. then you'd see the normal fee descriptions when it expands. The default choice would be whatever is set in global preferences.\nAs for cluttering the UI, description area could be replaced with 'advanced features' expander where several other useful features could be tucked away, like description, fee selector, additional output addresses, and tx input selection.\n. @KeyJockey I'm ok with CoPay's selectable presets and do not have a need to user specified arbitrary values. I only wish to be able to have a way to override the global default.\n. More importantly, there are some concerns of a confidence game/exploit if its not readily apparent to a noob that it is a testnet wallet.\n. I think a new user would appreciate seeing an associated fiat amount. I was thinking of a non-removable watermark over the balance area that says \"TestNet Coins - no real value\" or something similar.\n. Can this be enabled for TestNet. I am unable to scan testnet private keys from bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com.\nThis will be VERY handy and educational for my CoPay wallet classes!. The testnet accounts are not even displayed when viewing these section on the screens.. Android 7, Nexus 6. \nLinux version running on Fedora 25.\nChrome web app.\nAll demonstrate the same symptoms.. The testnet accouts are not visible in the lists.. The testnet accounts are visible in the home page, but when you go to spend testnet coins, it is not possible to see the accounts to select them for use. They are not in the list.. Two, one is a single sig account with 31.5 coins. The other is a multi-sig with over 214 coins.. I'm going to chock this up to confusion with the new UI, but it is clear this issue is user error. I can only imagine the initial wallet creation for the other user did not include creating the wallet as a testnet wallet (even though I specifically went through the steps to make it so and for whatever reason, it didn't stick). And/Or, the change in the way the UI works compared to previous version: send/receive is now the first step, vs selecting the account to work with. I will be seeing this user again later this morning to verify the test wallet settings and identify where the mistakes were made.\nBut since this issue is clearly incorrect, I will close it in shame. Sorry for the lost cycles.. The current UI is very confusing and non-intuitive for new users. Users tend to want to browse their account list and select an account interact with (to send/receive), which is counter to the current requirement to select a function (receive, scan, send) first, the select the account. \nIf they select an account first, there should be a means to select an operation (receive, send) on that account.\nWhen selecting the send function, it is difficult for users to make decisions on to/from accounts because there is no balance information shown. Continuing on to the amount page, there is again no balance information. Users will have to guess/remember an amount to enter that is less than what's actually available. Further, the ability to \"Send All/Max\" is not intuitive. No new user I train can ever find this on their own.\nPerhaps simply changing the order of these screens may help: From/To first, then placing the amount screen last.\nHaving to choose the settings function to get to wallet details is annoying and non-intuitive. This should be accessible from viewing the wallet from the lists.. Using version 3.2.0 on android and linux.. They are all brain wallets too! \nBasically... sha256(\"Wallet name/description\" + \"cosigner name/ID\" + \"strong and memorable password\"), then this entropy is used to generate my own recovery phrases for any wallet/account I ever need. The password stays in my head and I keep a list of accounts out in the semi-open. It's a bit more complicated than that, but it works awesome!. Linux is missing the signature as well.. Additional passwords to the mnemonic is a part of the BIP39 standard. It should be restored.. Still not solved for me. There has to be a way to rebroadcast a TX or at least clear the TX out of my cache. This sucks.. Over two weeks and the unconfirmed transactions are still pending and locking funds in my wallet.. It's been over a month now since I created this ticket. I've re-imported the wallet to the latest version and I still get the same error: 1) The wallet immediately shows locked funds, and 2) Insight has no knowledge of the transaction when I try to \"view it on the blockchain\".\nThis is currently locking up a non-insignificant amount of BCH for me and I'd really like to get this resolved.. This problem persists across a multi-sig wallet on Android and Linux installations. \nCurrent version is 4.2.0 on all devices.\nThere are no log entries in the Session log at the Error or warning levels.\nThere is no \"error\" to screen shot. If I click the timer right below the balance information while viewing the wallet, it will show the \"Spendable Balance\" screen, which shows my locked funds as \"confirming\" since the day I created the transaction (over 30 days ago).\nThe wallet IDs are: \n6598987f-a896-49b9-\nd70cdec5-2f5d-478b-\nIf you are unable to grep out the wallet IDs from those partial wallet IDs, I'd like a means to send them to you privately. Perhaps post your pgp key?\n. @matiu \nI send my wallet details to you via email. Never got a response. Funds still stuck.\n\nOn 2018-05-02 10:58, Julian Tosh wrote:\n-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\nhQIMA8Bnn1xqoy3cAQ/+Jlb8XrjCqr7T4AIQlLOHL/IvKfXKN/yXSKpd8awShzAu\nQ6KUL7sDMyeuhD70brQA+TLkcP2PbfZm8IQFTATa0svgOCVtgEU2lNzNYtzkHlt4\nXwjmj+HUcB5m+BEkbb9tLN00GaC1hPR3ktIiqCXqtcETjT61vCxikoevm72k1dNw\nnwHViS0LWuGlh8og26PUhVdjYxC4I+RFgUZSh+GlC5gwZDfenoo791rop7bnbiSL\naSRpOdg1z1uzT2jfeiIkJVkCribSB4l/+rTbxAHnsXM3lOKDUTzbiuUIAMklN2a3\nbnkDjbETn9B+E0ENrOG/C9R0gI16aSAeOG1J2QIChYEgwwTla0LeJRKL2kW4NNDD\n5bnSziibUDD5nEjlzg+AVr8rystlwdYdCaoClEgVOq56i9uKgg7uBj8MWqfzBvbM\nI+2QdUL1P+gpucespktwifJjKP/oNKXRMQ1EBsgvUhaCCeGUHVziBEtSF0j1eWac\nv43I2OF//+nVibbsZ83b6MNrpex3Ld3uFwY1wnLdp2zojmcKTDNRVCBMZ0jkL7GG\nA/DbLbLCU5dQrDeN91D0c8ep0jNA3UaR6pzgx3JEPq6dy/ZgOc0bdZdprt77D1p2\nPk1HXv+TnIL3aEgDVetQ67rTaoz2enACnwOafcq9QcSjaIj+VTQfRzt51SDU8hLS\newEHVdUYapDpNd0SbTq+Gsauw65YlxH7oibklQu557KO8b3N8B7sSSs7TVZlQi7R\npTQAP4Bmk6VC3gfmveROcwa+6m+jOfVU+HVqqHctj1EVFSawaNOpDbobSj7GP6GP\neGWWikJorVeAegnlubALJWphyc9kFHp4QqOBkQ==\n=575U\n-----END PGP MESSAGE-----. @matiu \n\nI can now see the transaction details in Insight, but it is not visible on other BCH blockchain explorers. Transaction has been unconfirmed for 24 hours. Funds are still locked in Copay. Please advise.. How about simply providing a mechanism for users to delete unconfirmed transactions from the wallet? Or a mechanism to rebroadcast a transaction in the wallet that is not seen by the insight servers?\nThat would immediately eliminate dozens of user's (or more) open issues. #8322. >>  How about simply providing a mechanism for users to delete unconfirmed\n\ntransactions from the wallet?\n\nYes\n\nThis can happen if the fee is very low and less than some relay fees.\n\nIt is currently not possible to adjust BCH fees in the Copay client (3.15.2). I suppose that's another issue that needs fixing?\n\nThe idea is:\n\nYes, that sounds ideal. Perhaps you could simply integrate the \"delete\" option with the option to delete the account's cache, rather than create a different UI for it.. Force stop the app, then clear the app cache in the app manager. DO NOT clear the app data - only the app cache. This works for me on Android. Mileage may vary on iOS. This has been happening to me more and more as well, but the steps resolve the issue for me.. Was there a BIP39 \"optional/additional\" passphrase associated with your 12 words? Without that passphrase during recovery, you would see what you're seeing.. I am about to report a problem with the current release. There seems to be a bug in the recovery routine. I suggest you download a previous version to your desktop to recover your funds. Pick an older version of the client that matches when you created the account for best results. Go by date perhaps. Releases are here: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/releases. https://github.com/bitpay/copay/releases. Are you 100% positive you're using the same version you created the wallet with? Might not hurt to go back one or two more revisions. Also, try the \"official\" recovery tool: https://bitpay.github.io/copay-recovery/\nJust shots in the dark. I hope something works for you.. The original wallets were created with 3.7.0 or 3.7.1 in 2017-07. The current release 3.15.2 and android version 4.1.2 would not import the old wallets that had the BIP39 extended passphrase. My brother had to go back to 3.9.0 release to successfully reimport the wallets with the BIP39 extended passphrase.. Some bitcoin cash services have not yet started using the new BCH address format. You will need to convert the legacy BCH address to the new format. You can use this bitpay tool for the conversion.\nhttps://bitpay.github.io/address-translator/\nedit: That address above should translate to bitcoincash:pr94ws3erzc3elkae57dk675amhfvze735rqd4jy2g.

I upgraded to the latest in the android app store. After it finished upgrading, I opened the app and it stuck on the splash screen.\nI tried force quitting the app, then deleting the apps' cache (not data). Same result: freezes at the splash screen.. To clarify, this device was running an older version of Copay (don't remember the version). I don't use it very often so it was out of date. I let the play store update the app to the latest version of Copay available.\nI have not ever used the BitPay app.. ",

Thank you guys very helpful\n. did you do all updates to system? sounds like updates broke it from what they were saying\n. @matiu i do believe we need api.. using the bitcore-wallet or bitcore-wallet-client it would need to connect to bitcore-wallet-service connected to a bitcore-node correct? so we would need to run our own full node? or are their bitpay full-nodes we can utilize? looks like cost of running a full node on digital ocean will be $160 a month... not trying to spend that right now for a wallet api\n. @JulianTosh right but that is essenitally the same thing as running bitcore-node full bitcoin node which i started out saying will cost $160 month on digital ocean... unless i'm missunderstanding you\n. unless you are suggesting that i can also run insight locally but i'd still be tied to someone else node\n.

    "peanut-brittle": "Is there perhaps some kind of workaround for this? The idea I had is to export the address(es) into another wallet program that can do the signing function. I tried this but it seems other programs don't want to use the .aes.json file. Suggestions?\n. XBTdev, thanks for your helpful input. What exactly is \"recovery tool\" and how does one use it to extract private keys from a backup file or seed?\n. Strange, it's telling me it can't decrypt the private key even I just went and reset the password for it in Copay. Using the .aes.json file generated from the \"export wallet\" option in Copay should work fine for this recovery tool, right?\n. I tried the recovery tool again with a new backup file and it worked this time (instead of saying it couldn't decrypt the private key like before). But all it did was give me the ability to transfer funds from the wallet to a new address. So it must be getting the private keys from the backup to be able to transfer funds, but it gives me no easy way of getting the private keys, so I'm not any closer to being able to sign a message.\n.

The transaction (with normal fee setting) took more than an hour and half to receive its first confirmation (unconfirmed transactions in the network were at the time above 10k).\nFrom user experience perspective, a bit distressing was when the transaction disappeared from the \"Activity\" feed and the wallet balance printed 0 BTC.

As already stated in my question, my question is not how to do it, or how I create a read only wallet from a copay wallet. I know about the wallet client I have actually linked the wrapper in the link description. It might be also my fault for being not clear enough, so next try:\nWhat I ask for is the interoperability between copay and the wallet client. Are there plans to support in copay to just drop in the xpub instead of using the seed or import a file backup? Or is this nothing from interest and I will have to grab the source part from copay to create the file backup together with the bw-client?\n.

If the payment request is failing verification when it should, we could use more test cases in: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-payment-protocol\nSounds like it could be useful to diplay a note that payment protocol was not used when using a backwards compatible BIP72 URI, and give an error in the a case that non-backwards compatible BIP72 URI.

I see, thanks for adding the test case. \n. @lclc I've seen this issue before, and it was because of trying to spend an unconfirmed transaction that the receiving backend bitcoind didn't have yet.

A simple \"+\" to add additional recipients I don't think would cause confusion (in the case that the features isn't needed).

You'll need to create a backup of your wallet to use the latter. Hope this helps.\n. Be careful which BWS you end up using, as if you use the wrong one they can steal your bitcoin...\n.

I had 2 recent double payments go out - same fee, same destination - and I'm absolutely certain I didn't confirm these twice.\nBoth of them were to Coinbase's web merchant dialog where I had sent a payment with a normal (non multisig) wallet after having scanned the address via a QR code.  So, some exacerbating factor could be present there.\nIn my case, the addresses from the two instances where duplicate payments happened are as follows:\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1KCCtQpVchK9wfNcYNK5yb7kNXLMSpNMNN\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/15hQYSoxsq7buyWUtKmC4o5rxXTaLHpnco\nI'm also using the iOS version.\nUnlike the OP, the app didn't crash on me.  It gave me no warning I had sent two payments.  They went out so close in time (judging by blockchain.info timestamp) there's no way I could have done them somehow forgotten having done so.  I just discovered it today as I was going through my transaction history within the app and noticing the duplicates after wondering why my wallet balance was lower than expected.\n. Just to follow up for testing purposes (to test the hypothesis that this only happens when you scan a QR code meeting some sort of criteria) I went to the same Coinbase merchant and did the same workflow to get a QR code, the same way I got QR code for the two previous transactions that got duplicated.  Then instead of making a payment, I just used a normal QR reader to decode the following plain text:\nbitcoin:19BX7y7hEvjB81jR5c1MCKz4jiEBUJLxRS?amount=0.153306&r=https://www.coinbase.com/r/57f934ed5de12c7194184d80\n(and here's the QR image, if this worked properly)\n\n.

    "toomim": "Wow, the new UI has big problems, I'm about to switch away from copay! It just led me to send a huge amount of money to the WRONG ADDRESS. I might have lost this money!\nTask: I wanted to get a receive address for one of my wallets to send money to.\n  1. So I click on the wallet in the home screen\n  2. Then I click on \"Receive\" at the bottom\n  3. It shows me an address. But this is the address for a TOTALLY DIFFERENT WALLET.\nJesus this is such an obvious bug! Wallets need to support sending and receiving money!. Here's another bug:\nTask part 2: Copy the address to clipboard so you can paste it somewhere and pay to it\n  1. On the receive screen, it only shows me PART of the address. So I can't even read it. Or select it.\n  2. There's no way to copy the address from here\n  3. If you click on the address, it takes you to a new screen. Nothing at the top of the screen shows you the address. You actually have to SCROLL down into a list of addresses, and try to identify which one in the list you want to use, and then click on it, and cross your fingers and hope that you chose the right one.\nWhat the heck guys? The primary feature of a wallet is being able to PUT MONEY into it!\nAnd here's another bug: once I reached that \"advanced wallet addresses\" screen, the back button disappeared! I had no way to return to the home screen. I had to force quit the app. Just because I wanted to get a receive-money address!. Here's another problem:\nOn that advanced \"wallet addresses\" screen, it doesn't tell you which wallet you're looking at the addresses for! If I'm about to send a bunch of money, I want to be sure that I'm using the right address! How can I be sure that these are the right addresses? I have to click back (if the back button is there) and read the wallet, and then go back and read the address on a different page?. Here's another bug: the confirm page UI is flat out failing to show the amount I'm sending!\n\nWhat's happened? Is the company alright? Are you still supporting this software? Should I switch to something else?. That design just caused me to send $10,000 to a wallet that isn't even in use anymore, and almost lost $10,000. Two of the copayers has since deleted the app, because we weren't using the wallet. I barely got 3 other copayers to find their private keys and recover the money.\nIf Computer Science PhDs are losing $10,000 due to the confusing UI in your app, then there's a problem in the UI.\nI've been promoting Copay for the last year. But now I am telling everyone I know to transfer money out of it. I have been raging mad for the last 60 minutes trying to correct the loss of this money.\n@gasteve . @bitjson This is not just because the old Copay behaved like that. It's because it's the only sane way for any bitcoin wallet to work.\nIf I click on a wallet, and then click on receive, it is insane for it to give me the receive address for a different wallet. Why would I want a RANDOM wallet's receive address? Is this a casino?\nThere's no use case for choosing a random wallet. That's just wrong.. @bitjson Feel free to facetime me: toomim@gmail.com. You can also imessage or sms me at 510-282-4312. I am happy to give design feedback.. The \"cards\" at the bottom do not look like cards. You can only see one at a time. That means that it's not clear that you can select a different one.\nThis icon:\n\n...is vague. I could not tell what it meant. I could not tell that I could choose a different wallet by clicking on it.\nIt is not clear that the address shown above is coming from the wallet shown below. There is a very subtle grey triangle inlay that might suggest that, but that's not clear.\nThe wallet is shown AFTER the address, but it comes BEFORE for the user's task. The user's task in receiving money is (1) specify which wallet they want money from, and then (2) copy the QR code or bitcoin address. But with this design, the user has to go from bottom to top. That's bad. Humans process screens from top to bottom, left to right.\nI could list more problems.. Hey guys, do you do any user testing on desktop?\nThe \"swiping a card\" at the bottom for accounts is not intuitive on desktop, and displays the wrong cursor.\nIn order to change accounts, you have to drag and drop a card with the mouse. But drag and drop is not an easy operation with a mouse. And if you DO need drag and drop, you should use a \"grab\" cursor  or a \"pointer\"  but right now it's using a default arrow cursor: . That gives no suggestion to the user that you can even drag and drop, and thus that you can change accounts.\nIf you didn't run into the problem selecting a wallet in your user testing, it sounds a lot like you didn't test with any desktop users. I recommend you give it a shot.\nAlso, ask them to try copying the bitcoin receive address to the clipboard. I bet they will find it confusing. You are making them click on the QR code right now! That doesn't make sense when you have a mouse cursor.. Also, when something is clickable you should use the pointer icon: \nBut none of the cards are showing up as clickable. It displays no pointer icon. So changing accounts is not discoverable on desktop. \nFinally, it would be way better if you reversed the order and put the account selection on TOP. Users need to select their account before they grab its bitcoin address, and actions in a user-interface should proceed top-to-bottom, left-to-right, in the same order that western people read.\nThanks for reading! I hope the UI gets better.. Also, consider that there are two different UIs for selecting wallets in the new version of copay:\n\nOn the home screen, there's a vertical menu of wallets, with left-set typography, non-bold, displaying the k-of-n multisig type, and a \">\" arrow at the right, that you select by tapping on to scroll the menu to the right.\nOn the receive screen, there's a horizontal list of \"cards\", each of which have a bold name and do not list their multisig type, and you move amongst with drag and drop from left to right.\n\nThis breaks the principle of consistency in UI design. The user interface should use a consistent UI mechanism for selecting wallets in all parts of the UI.\nFurthermore, this is a strong indicator that there should not be two separate places to select your wallet in the first place. It's likely that the tab bar at the bottom was a mistake. If you just have people choose a wallet first, and THEN show them all the things they can do with the wallet, you don't need two different UIs \u2014 you don't even need two different places to choose a wallet! You just choose the wallet once, in one place, and then work with it. This fundamental change simplifies the entire UI design and eliminates these inconsistencies.\nIf you didn't choose to design two different UIs for selecting a wallet, you would also save design time. You wouldn't have to polish and perfect the UI in both places. You wouldn't have introduced the UI bug with the cursor pointer type. I recommend simplifying the app. It'll save you development time, give you more time to polish the elements you have left, result in fewer UI bugs and less user confusion, and also save users time because there will be fewer screens to click through to accomplish their tasks.. Does someone have a screenshot handy of the new UI? Without running this code, I'm guessing that it makes this change:\n\nFrom the home screen, if you click on a wallet\nThere will no longer be tabs available at the bottom of the screen\n\nIf so, this is certainly an improvement to prevent the most egregious part of the error. I'm looking forward to any help I can give for the deeper redesign.. Great, thanks! I think this is an insightful quick fix, and look forward to deeper redesign.. I recommend trying a transaction accelerator. You should be able to get this transaction in for far less than $350.. Yes, this affected me too. See https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/5808. It should be called \"Close.\"\n\nOn May 4, 2017, at 10:23 AM, Gabriel Edgardo Baz\u00e1n notifications@github.com wrote:\nAny suggestion ?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. \n",

    "dmo580": "Hi @cmgustavo I noticed the recent update does address this however it's not 100% perfect. When I switch back into Copay from recent apps in Android, the screen still initially shows the previous state of the app before bringing me back into the splash screen.\nI compared this with LastPass which I have set to always require password/fingerprint, and regardless of my previous screen in LastPass, it will relaunch in a splash screen/protected page to hide the previous contents. In fact LastPass appears as a blank screen even in the recents menu so it protects all content.\nI feel like you guys are almost there! But let's just make it fully secure.\n\n. I've noticed this too. The backup method is not clearly explained that it is your system's unlock password/pin. I think this is a UI/UX issue.. I mean that's fine if you want to use the Device Password, but it needs to be clear what \"Use Backup\" means. I have seen no other app use the device password as a backup--Authy (iOS), Bank of America, Chase, LastPass, PayPal all fall back to their standard password/PIN login for their service.\nI guess what I'm getting at is most apps including the OS basically make you set a password before setting up the Fingerprint as an alternative. I feel like that's the most sensible too for Copay--so basically let someone lock via PIN or Password and then allow Fingerprint to unlock in place of PIN/Password.\nWhat I'm getting at with regards to a security tab is that there's too many password options right now and its buried in different places.\nBy the way why are you removing the password to secure the recovery phrase? How do you protect the backup then?. Similarly, the \"Cancel\" button just puts you in an infinite loop of a fingerprint prompt. I would think if you want to cancel, you are taken back to the main screen where you are told to enter a seed manually or you are booted out of the app (exit).\nI'm basically pushing for a more friendly UI/UX.. @gabrielbazan7 Have you had a chance to look into this?\nAt the very minimum I feel that the Use Backup button should not take me into an endless loop. To me that button is at least broken.\nThen there are the UI/UX improvements I talked about such as clarifying all the different passwords that one can use in Copay.. @JDonadio it does not work.\nEntering password brings me to a screen that says \"Scan Again.\" The only way past this is to scan your fingerprint.\nAlso as I mentioned before, no other app out there ties backup password with the device password. This login should be entirely separate from my device encryption password.. I also would argue the same issue occurs on the iOS side where there is no backup method to login once you lock the app via fingerprint.\nThis comes down to a UI/UX issue where the app should be protected by a PIN/Password that's separate from the device password so that someone can have a fallback from fingerprint lock. I invite the developers to take a look at apps that allow TouchID/Pixel or Nexus Imprint like LastPass, Chase/Bank of America/PayPal, etc.. Yes, any password registration field IMO deserves a confirmation prompt.. ",

I'm happy to try and help as well although I'd have to get myself familiar with the application. Without Trezor sharing the xpubs though, can Copay do anything until they support it?. @jwebbstevens, @matiu It looks like this is supported in v4 of the trezorconnect lib, see here.\nThis lists the new Segwit accounts but for some reason copay can't recover it from the XPUB that is  produced, not sure why this is yet but it looks like copay just needs to update the trezorconnect dependency to v4 to get started on the implementation of this:\n\"trezor-connect\": \"https://github.com/trezor/connect.git#541c57beac7e2707453ef416eb7fcceed1141981\",\nHere is a screenshot that shows it using account discovery:\n\n. @jwebbstevens, this is disappointing... I'm almost wondering if Copay just needs to update bitcore to support Segwit though and update to v4 of the trezorconnect SDK. I can at least get my Segwit xPub out of trezor, it just doens't satisfy Copay because it's not using the right derivation. I'll see what I can figure out with bitcore but I think you're right -- DOA until trezor and copay work together on this. \nJust FYI, I have found a wallet that works as watch only for Trezor at least on iOS called bitWallet -- not sure which mobile device you prefer.\nGo here and export the xPub for the Segwit account -- this is v4 trezor connect.\nIn bitWallet, go to Add a new wallet, specify HD Wallet -> Restore a Wallet -> Enter the xPub in the Extended Key or Mnemonic and choose Segwit on the account type.\nMakes me sad I got a Trezor, should've went for the Ledger Nano...

Without this feature, it seems a user has to securely redistribute (i.e., offline with SSS) a new recovery phrase every time there is a compromised wallet or chain split.\nDon't you think deprecating this feature makes secure backup and recovery extremely difficult? Is there another method that is a suitable replacement for this removed feature?. Thanks for recognizing the value of the feature and assigning the ticket. However, the ticket is \"closed\", so I worry it won't be noticed. Would you please reopen it?\nThanks!. Hi @BGalliotti, it seems that @MrsMasternode hijacked this ticket to make an unrelated complaint.\nYour answer does not address my original question, which was not about Windows 10. Would you please remove \"Windows 10\" from the title and remove the \"Answered\" flair?\nThanks!. > check that the version and commit match\nHi @cmgustavo, I meant to ask how we can verify that the released code matches the open source. Obviously, any bad actor could release some compromised software that puts anything in the \"About\" screen. And, it seems important that verification should not depend on running the app!\nThe attack that I am concerned about is a bad copay employee, someone with copay's Apple's login credentials, Apple, or anyone else down the distribution chain makes a small modification to the code that sends private keys to the bad actor, thereby giving the bad actor control over all funds held in all Copay wallets..

    "lassikin": "\nOSS should be treated with a no trust mentality when dealing with sensitive data. Strict Content Security Policies can prevent hacks that steal data and thorough E2E/unit tests can prevent hacks that mess with UX.\n\nThe problem will remain if those tests are public and the project has dependencies on 3rd party submitters - automatic testing cannot be trusted. The offending code can be made to not activate under the tests and rather easily at that if the tests are public. The core of the problem is trusting hundreds of 3rd party maintainers to stay straight. The only reasonable action would be to work to remove the dependencies(possibly fork known good versions of them).\nFor me the 1) and 3) are the reasonable things to do. When any of the dependencies change, go through the changes manually, if they are not relevant/necessary not include the updates.\nIn addition to just go through the dependencies to remove any that are so small as to just include in the main project, just to lower the amount of people that need to be trustworthy.\nRestricting network access within the dependencies of the app is very hard to do practically as is only allowing access to storage from certain code parts(in a fashion that you could trust it)..

    "Gamboster": "Fixed, ty. Ok. I prefer to have this type of functions in the controller, to not dirty the html. I removed it, thanks. Why is this change necessary?. It isn't used at the moment. I will remove it. Got it. Thanks. If this variable is not used in the view, it should be private. I think the '_' is unnecessary due to typing. The styles should be in the css file, to avoid dirtying the html. The same with the following lines. I think wallet info should have its own CSS file. You forgot to delete this console.log. Hi @bitjson , Could you check this PR? We need to merge it to be able to send desktop. The home page tests are already being done in a separate PR.. In a future PR, which is almost ready, we will merge a fix that will allow us to eliminate the timeout, but it needs to be tested yet.. duplicated code. duplicated. It is used in receive, confirm, tx-details and txp.. I think we can move it to app.scss, to prevent duplicate code. string ?. I think we can remove these dividers from: wallet information, export wallet and wallet service URL pages. Remove this. I think you could use something like this:\n[ngClass]=\"{'class1 class2' : expression1}\">. We could change the name of that function in another pull request. Fixed. You could add *ngIf=\"!isCordova\" here.. The getNetwork function currently returns undefined. That test works correctly. I will update the description. we have to update BWS with bitcore-lib-cash version 0.18.1 to get correct values for BCHTEST prefix. That function also removes suffixes from uris, for example: \n'bitcoin:1CVuVALD6Zo7ms24n3iUXv162kvUzsHr69?amount=0.00090000'\nThe function returns: 1CVuVALD6Zo7ms24n3iUXv162kvUzsHr69\nMaybe I can use cleanAddress ?. Done! Thanks. Done. Done. Great idea! Done. Done. ^_^. It should be const instead let. Please, in alphabetical order. Do not commit the package-lock file. Use the same version that we are using for other plugins, please (4.14.0). Try to center the image and text when print in mobile. I think this line is not necessary. You could remove it. If you delete showBalanceButton, probably you have to remove that variable from the controller file also. Is this class still necessary?. We have repeated 3 times the code to list wallets in the same view:\nWe should optimize that in some way. For the moment, adding a 'TODO' would be enough, and we leave it for another PR. It is rare that the option to import a vault, removes one of the options above (Select coin). The user may get confused. This case already exists. ",

    "msalcala11": "It seems like the description for this test is no longer accurate, since the code being tested no longer seems to reset to the default config on a load error.. Although not visible in this diff, it's a good idea to also remove the imported pages in this file.. It looks like this code block is duplicated 3 times in this PR, which violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. A more concise approach would be to define the switch statement on the AppComponent and to fire events from the incomingDataService to the AppComponent. The AppComponent would then perform the navCtrl.push action.. It seems like this line is unnecessary if the androidFingerprintAuth Promise were directly returned instead of wrapped in a new Promise. Also this approach will not pass the rejection error to the .catch block.. same here. same here. Because this catch block isn't doing any logic (such as logging), this catch block can be removed. Instead, the caller of verifyIOSFingerprint should define a catch handler.. unnecessary catch block. unnecessary catch block. unnecessary catch block. unnecessary catch block. This looks like it can work for android, but not for iOS because the error codes on iOS are different: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/touch-id/\nFrom the link above, here are the two possible \"User Canceled\" error codes:\n-2 or -128 - User tapped the 'Cancel' button.\nIt might be worth consolidating the different iOS and Android messages in the check method of the touchid provider and then returning a consistent error message to all callers of the method when a user cancels touchid.. It looks like this css was copied and pasted from another file, which makes code very hard to maintain. Is there a way we can reuse the pre-existing css without having to copy and paste it into a new file?. Text should be Backup Needed. icon should be <img src=\"assets/img/onboarding-success.svg\">. Still the wrong icon here. . The fact that there's no animation here feels a bit weird on iOS. Simplifying to this.navCtrl.push(LockPage); will make the page transition feel more native on iOS.. We now have a mixin called center for these 3 lines in mixins.scss. It can be used via @include center;. It is best to avoid using !important whenever possible.. seems like the option input is not necessary since the primary button can always emit true and the secondary button can always emit false.. can be simplified to this.actionSheetProvider.createInfoSheet('sensitive-info');. Same for all other info sheets in this diff.. I wouldn't move this css out of the wide-header-page file. This was rather hacky css that should really only be necessary for wide header pages because Ionic's navbar css does not get applied if the navbar is nested inside of a custom component (such as wide-header-page). The other navbars in the app should continue using Ionic's normal css.. The arrow padding and font-weight can be made global. The rest of the wide-header-styles should stay in this file.. I don't think this is necessary (Use higher fees setting to faster delivery) We use payment protocol for gift card purchases and the fee is locked . The expired state should not be necessary, since it indicates that the invoice itself expired, and in that case, we just remove the card from storage (so it won't even show up). Because updatePendingGiftCards causes a new observable subscription to be created every time it is called, repeated pull to refresh actions will add more and more subscriptions. To ensure each subscription is closed after a response is received you can use .pipe(take(1)): this.giftCardProvider.updatePendingGiftCards([this.card]).pipe(take(1)).subscribe(card => (this.card = card));. This is where commonly-used, generic functions will go.. The first function I've added (promiseSerial) executes a lists of async tasks in series.. probably also want to delete public emailHash on line 8.. ",
