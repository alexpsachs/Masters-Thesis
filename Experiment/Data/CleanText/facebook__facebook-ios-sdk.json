One of the two offending delegates is addressed by changes from the recent 3.0 update. However, the other one still stands, and we will include a fix to it in the next update. Thanks for the improvement to the SDK!\n. Thanks for the pull request! We recognize that JSON libraries are a pain point in the SDK and have been for a while. Unfortunately the recent 3.0 update did not improve this. In fact, now that we are packaging the SDK as a framework (implying linking, rather than compiling the SDK into your app), there is a new wrinkle in the problem. The solutions available to us appear to be:\nA) A fix along the lines of this diff -- where for projects where you compile the code it is easy to swap-out the JSON bits\nB) A fix that allows \"binary\" swapping of the JSON parser, via some abstraction -- so that users of the framework also get the flexibility to swap out the parser\nB') Same as B, but with an included version of SBJSON for the users that doesn't care to swap out -- but renaming classes to avoid collisions.\nC) Wait until 5.0 is the lowest supported level, and move the implementation to NSJSONSerialization.\nOn the surface, B or B' seem like the most useful solution, however B has the negative side effect of making everyone include a JSON library on their own even if their needs are very simple, and B' has a bloat problem -- though maybe that doesn't matter much?\nWould love to hear your opinions :)\n. Thanks @stig for the thoughts. I think the dependencies instructions approach is certainly the most \"correct\" in the sense that that approach scales to any number of dependency codebases, etc.\n.

This is the right fix, for apps that need to force the inline dialog. Of course we strongly favor single-sign-on, when possible. That said, we are currently evaluating support for login scenarios that aren't easy to do with the SDK as it presently is; and so we can roll this use case into that discussion -- and see if we want to support the down-level login more directly. Thanks for taking the time to publish the diff!\n. @deyton thanks for the fix! I have pushed it along with a handful of other with 5077944.

Hi @Fogh and @romaonthego, Christine pushed a change similar to the one suggested here, but integrated with the existing script. Please let us know if it does not address the problem for your configuration. Thanks!\n. Thanks alverezm50 for the fix, making the lib linkable!\n. @naan, thanks for the diff! We also want to support NSJSONSerialization in the SDK. We are currently working on changes close to this area that will impact how/when we can roll support into master, though. Thanks!\n. @davidbitton, OSX support is on our radar, and your work here will be helpful to us when we are prepared to take on the effort. At this time we are not ready for the support impact of full OSX capability.\nMeanwhile, this is great to see and may be helpful to others in the community right now. Have you considered introducing a fork?\n. Its a good suggestion. It may take us a while to break-out the UX code a bit more cleanly, but we have changes planned where that would naturally fit. It may be a bit, however, before we get to those changes. Is that work a blocker for getting to a fork, or more of an additional improvement for the fork?\n. Yes -- agree completely. Thinking about this some more, if the work involved in tightening it up is significant at all, you may want to wait to do the work until after our next major feature checkin -- which shouldn't be too far out.  This way you won't have to churn again after putting in the effort. We will do our best to break things out a bit more, per your suggestions. For now we should close the pull request -- though I look forward to seeing the code resurface down the road. Thanks!!\n. Hi @adamvduke, 5077944 rolls up your diff with a few others. Thanks very much for the contribution!\n. @adamvduke, yup you are absolutely right about this. I have rolled your change in with a few other pull requests. Thanks again for the contribution!\n. Hi @SevaUA, 5077944 rolls in a change motivated by your pull request, but isolated to requests initiated by the Facebook class. Let me know if this does not address the problems that you were running into. Thanks very much for the diff!\n. Hi Josh,\nThere are two ways to accomplish what you are shooting for here, with the existing SDK:\n1) Create an FBRequest object with a nil session, and set the access_token parameter directly\n2) Create an FBSession object, and pass in a custom TokenCachingStrategy object that lets you set the token explicitly for the session object (You can find an internal implementation of TokenCachingStrategy named ManualTokenCachingStrategy used by the Facebook class that does just this.)\nTwo feels a bit \"design heavy\" to me for simple needs, but if your app does a lot of page posting, it may be useful to have an FBSession object at the ready with the token in place. Unfortunately, there are a handful of reasons that accessToken is readonly.\nTo make this simpler in the SDK, we should probably just create a post helper (similar to [FBRequest requestForPostStatusUpdate]) which makes it easy to put together a request for posting to a page. What do you think?\n. Thanks for the pull request. This is fixed in the latest update. Thanks again!!\n. Thanks for the pull request. This is fixed in the latest update. Appreciate it!!\n. Thanks for the pull request, this should be fixed in the latest update. Thanks!\n. Hi @tylerberry, thanks for the pull request. We are also eager to reduce the number of libraries that we depend on in the SDK. Our plan is to eventually move to NSJSONSerialization, on the merits of being built into the OS. However, as long as we continue to support iOS 4.3, we are not able to move to the built in library.\nI do understand the benchmark argument -- though we have not independently verified the performance difference. Between now and the point where we deprecate 4.3, I can see adding #define support for swapping out the SBJSON bits for anyone willing to build the SDK themselves, this would give an easy way to swap-out whatever library they want. I don't  believe we would try and make swapping an option for the lib, nor do we have plans to ship another library given that soon we should be able to use the OS. Do you think the #define interim solution adds enough value to consider?\n. That's great feedback, thanks!\n. Per the preceding discussion, standardize on the API in the OS when we deprecate support for 4.3. Until then, status quo, though per @tylerberry's observation we may be able to make simple use of the already existing macros to make this a little nicer. \n. Hi @rhaining, thanks for the pull request. Can you help me understand the behavior that you are seeing? (I tried to repro this a moment ago on the simulator -- do I need to use a device?) Anyhow, the authorizeUsingSystemAccountStore method should already only be called when running in iOS 6. So I am thinking that if it is crashing for you in this method in iOS 5.0, then there is some other bug higher-up on the call stack. \nFinally, one last question, just to make sure we are working from the same baseline, are you building from 4.5? The SDK can no longer be built using 4.0.\n. Hi, thanks for bringing this to our attention. Yes, we will be updating to fix this one in the near term. -- Jason\n. Hi @zeevvax, today's update addresses this. Thanks!!\n. Yup, that's the one!\n. Hi @arifken thanks for the fix, this should be fixed in the latest update. Thanks!!\n. @michaelmior, no, you should be able to use the accounts framework for Twitter, while logging on with Facebook using the fast app switch.\n. Hmm. Sorry, then I think I am misunderstanding the question. Either way, use of Twitter functionality in the accounts framework is independent of use of the Facebook API. Then can be mixed and matched freely in a single application, and use of Twitter has no impact on the Facebook SDK and vice-versa. Hope this answers the question.\n. :) Yes, always good to try it out. Still, to answer your question, as I currently understand it -- the Facebook SDK doesn't care whether the accounts framework is required or optional. Both work fine. However, if you make it required, then your app will not run on OS's prior to 5. \n. ",
    "PEZ": "Forgot to mention that I needed to make some changes to Facebook.m too to be able to create an FBRequest without also connecting the request at the same time. This is an example of usage within a Three20 datamodel:\nFBRequest* fbRequest = [fb getRequestWithGraphPath:@\"me/home\" andDelegate:nil];\nTTURLRequest* request = [TTURLRequest\n                         requestWithURL: [fbRequest getConnectURL]\n                         delegate: self];\n...\n[request send];\n. Wonderful! FBConnect + Three20 is a match made in heaven. =)\n. Using Three20's connections mechanism is much less work if your project is using Three20. That's if you want to use three20's TTTableViewController which makes it really smooth to consume an API and render it using the TTURLRequestModel, TTDataSource, TTItemCell, TTTableItem etcetera framework.\nThere's a (somewhat confused) discussion on the challenges involved here: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/three20/Yyj-FhUoZUI/discussion\nNote that this feature request is not only about three20. People use all kinds of frameworks where it is easier to follow the Tao if just FBConnect is ready to serve as \"factory\" for constructing the URLs for the API calls.\nBTW, I use FBConnect directly for many calls. It's great. It's when it needs to coexist within the framework I'm using that it helps having this make-this-fbrequest-url-for-me-please interface.\n. TTTableViewController works with TTModel subclasses. It's definitely possible to make a subclass and wrap FBConnect in it. Just that it did not look trivial to me when I took a look at it. TTURLRequestModel is there and ready for use if you just know what URLs to feed to it. For me it was much less work and much easier to add an interface to FBConnect like I did.\nSo, this feature request isn't sprung out of necessity. Rather convenience. Then again, that's how I see FBConnect, as a convenience library.\nOf course, I'm really a newbie when it comes to three20. It's entirely possible that I have missed something. (Even if that groups discussion didn't unearth any immediate solution either.)\n. Closed as in won't happen?\n. Rasputin, someone told me it has happened. Haven't gotten around to confirm. Please do.\n. Well, now I have checked it out, finally. =) I understand why it looked like the idea behind this pull request where implemented. But instead the master has moved in the other direction making my changes much harder to implement. Now, I don't know if I have the time to do it all over again, only to find that my work won't get pulled this time either. Then again, I really need the changes my self and even expand them to the legacy REST API too. Doing it in my outdated fork is not too much work, but doing it on the latest upstream master gives me a headache, just thinking about it.\n.  Glad to know someone else will have use for it too. I'll do it then. Look here tomorrow, shouldn't be that hard...\n. =) But I'm not a git cowboy for sure. I have messed up my repository now. It's FUBAR as far as I can tell. The source is updated but the commit history does not reflect it. I have no clue how to fix it. Maybe what I will have to do is remove my fork and fork anew and then apply my changes. No time for that right now though. But what you can do, Rasputin, is copy paste the relevant code from my FUBAR fork; that's Request.[hm] and Facebook.[hm], and give it a try. Works in my app... Sorry for the mess, I'll try to fix it later today.\n. This particular commit can't be pulled at the current stage. Will resubmit when I have fixed it.\n. Rasputin, now I've fixed the repository. You might have to do a new checkout. And you will have to update your app where it uses my changes. See this pull request for a quick \"howto\": https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/pull/345 \n. ",

This is just a pull request, the code in question is not in the official Facebook SDK yet.\n. The official SDK lives right here, where we are discussing. There are many forks of the official SDK that contain various new features. These forks are not official, but some of their features might eventually end up in the official SDK. There is no branch that would contain all the features. You might want to take a look at distributed Git workflow tutorial to get a better idea how the thing works. The multitasking detection code lives in a branch on my fork. If you want to try it, either check out that branch or wait until the code gets in the official SDK (if it does).\n.

As noted in the header comments, this only seems to work with the old-style authentication using the pop-up dialog. Still I find it much better than having no video upload at all, especially for those who need a migration path from the old SDK.\n. Fixed in what sense of the word?

In this methoud\n- (void)authorize:(NSString )application_id\n    permissions:(NSArray )permissions\n       delegate:(id)delegate {\n  [_appId release];\n  _appId = [application_id copy];\n[_permissions release];\n  _permissions = [permissions retain];\n_sessionDelegate = delegate;\n[self authorizeWithFBAppAuth:YES safariAuth:NO nativeLogin:self.forceNativeLogin];\n  }\n  I made change in last line of code. I changed  safariAuth:YES to safariAuth:NO.\n  Now it looks much better - but this is not a way to solw this problem.\n. But even now I do not have collback to dekegate methoud - (void)fbDidLogin{} \nAfter I closed modelView this collback works -(void)fbDidNotLogin:(BOOL)cancelled{}\n. Hi. Look. Just go through SDK code.\nWhen I using FBLoginDialog we load data from server to fill UIWebView.\nMaybe there is some problems on the server side. I made few test and I did not see that in \n- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView )webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest )request \n[url.scheme isEqualToString:@\"fbconnect\"] and so app dose not get any commands from UIWebView via HTTP requests.\n. I treid main first\n. so maybe my problem in URL Scheme. YOu mean to let Safary call tast app back to run?\n. Ok. I'l try to check it once more time. Thanks for help.\n. Thank man for your help. Just added correct appID to pList file and to the static NSString* kAppId =@\"MY APP ID\". Now all works fine. After I've made logIn test app comsBAck.\n. ",
    "sebastienbrault": "Hi,\nIn the simulator there is no Facebook application installed. The natural behavior of the SDK is to call Safari if the Facebook application is not installed. This behavior is not a modified by my patch. \nYou say you do not return back to the test app : What is the content of the Safari page loaded ? Is it a Facebook login page or a Facebook confirmation page ? Can you tap on a \"confirm\" or \"ok\" button, and if yes, what happens ? \nRegards.\nS\u00e9bastien. \n. Have you added the appropriate URL Schemes in the DemoApp-Info.list ? \n. If you set  safariAuth:NO in the simulator, I think you are going to have the old authentication method (with and UIWebView). \nWhy did you start with my fork instead of the main repository ?\n. Yes, you should add something like that in your DemoApp-Info.list, where [app-id] is your facebook app id. \n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n        <string></string>\n        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>fb[app-id]</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n.

    "WilliamDenniss": "Looks like an important fix.\n. +1 I encountered some severe bugs in SBJSON this year, JSONKit seems faster & more reliable (not to mention a smaller code footprint with just 2 files to include).\n. @stig by the time I noticed the bug, it was already fixed in a later version, so no need to file a report, but since you ask: I was losing precision on floats. Specifically my floats were only having 6 digits stored. e.g. 12.23456789 became 12.3456 and 123.456789 became 123.456, etc. This was quite bad and I lost precision on a whole bunch of data before I realised this issue. Sufficed to say I wasn't so keen on using SBJSON after that experience, even if that particular bug was addressed.\n. +1\n. ",

It's quite likely the same error would occur in the inline as well as the single sign on dialog. The service_disabled error code was created explicitly for errors that affect SSO but not the inline dialog. When the app encounters other errors it should just display an error message.\n. ",

Unless i got the basic understanding of delegates wrong i think this should be merged..\nHowever, wouldn't this cause a retain loop in certain cases?\nEdit 3: Even though i like the simplicity of removing bugs the above way, i think the root cause of the crash is the delegate being released while there is an outstanding request and the crash should be fixed by either not making the original delegate not go away, or cancel all outstanding requests before it does. Second solution can be implemented by keeping all your requests in an array and running through it on dealloc sending each request the cancel message. This will prevent a callback to a released delegate AND any retain loops which could be caused by the change from assign to retain. Im no expert though, just my 5 cents, correct me if im wrong.\n. ",

If you can, please include additional information (such as the stack trace or public API you were invoking).  Thanks.\n. My mistake, I only saw the initial change in FBDataDiskCache.m. You're right about nil'ing the delegate pointers, we'll fix that in our next release.\n. Thanks for submitting a pull request to the Facebook SDK.

We will start taking pull requests against our dev branch (which will be merged to master when we ship releases) so if you'd like to follow @bkelley-fb 's suggestion, feel free to cut a new request again dev. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the pull request. This is fixed now. Going forward, we will take pull requests against our dev branch so feel free to submit future requests there. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the feedback - we'll keep this badge integration in mind but have no immediate plans to incorporate it.\n. Thanks for the pull request, can you re-submit as against the dev branch? We'll start accepting requests there and merge them back into master with the next release.\n. Thanks for the PR - can you sign our CLA https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/cla and resubmit the pull request to our /dev branch (it'll get merged in the next release).\n. We have already merged that commit into the dev branch, thanks. It will get merged into master as part of our next release.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, we'll look into this. If you can file a report to developers.facebook.com/bugs with more details (such as if you're using FBLoginView or manually constructing FBSession instances, and if you're doing any explicit AppEvent logging), that would be very helpful (you can also submit confidential code in the report).\n. Thanks for the PR, we just shipped v4.0 of the SDK which includes significant code changes so that this should no longer be an issue.\n. Can you submit a pull request to the dev branch? Thanks.\n. Thanks. Cool fix - ./src was supposed to only have public headers so we'll move the offending files in the next release (or consider the other directory approach for simplicity)\n. Hey, this should be corrected now in 3.22 - let me know if there's any other issues. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the feedback. We'll definitely consider this design in the future but making a change now can affect developers who are explicitly managing FBRequest* instances on secondary threads with their own runloops.\n. Thanks for the PR. We just shipped v4.0 of the SDK and added setDelegateQueue to allow you to describe an operation queue to receive callbacks on which will resolve this issue.\n. Thanks for the PR. We just release v4.0 of the SDK which no longer has this issue.\n. Thanks for the pull request, but we currently require the latest Xcode (6.x) to build the SDK.\n. Thanks for the feedback; we'll keep it in consideration in case we decide to make the caching more extensible. To avoid incorrect implementations, v4 does not make this an extensibility point. Developers can observe the token changes and react accordingly (such as copying the token elsewhere).\n. As discussed in the issue thread, the approach going forward will be the new podspec per kit, so I'm going to close the PR, but thanks for the suggestion.\n. Great, thanks - can you submit a PR to the :dev branch instead? We'll merge into our master and push it to pods trunk in our next release. And to be clear, this is the default value of the attribute already so it shouldn't be a problem unless you're doing something unusual?\n. Thanks for the PR; we use xcconfig files so build settings changes should occur there. In this case, this change shouldn't be necessary (will discuss further on the issue you opened). Also for future reference, we take PRs to our :dev branch.\n. Thanks for the suggestion but this is not an extensibility point we'd like to add this point (nor the change to advertising id). \n. Thanks, can you submit the pull request against our :dev branch instead? You can also combine this with your other pull request if you'd like.\n. Thanks, can you submit the pull request against our :dev branch instead? You can also combine this with your other pull request if you'd like.\n. Please submit pull requests against the :dev branch. Thanks.\n. Can you provide a concrete example of your use case? What purpose does the nested \"apple\" dictionary serve? The namespace requirement is intentional. If you have complex open graph objects, their namespace should be \"flattened\". See the headerdoc of FBSDKShareOpenGraphObject for an example.\n. Closing due to lack of additional information - feel free to reopen/comment.\n. Thanks for the submission! That's a good point that the app's UIApplication delegate should default to returning YES. The original intention of our implementation is to return YES only if the URL was recognized and handled by the FBSDK. So it seems like our real problem is that our docs and samples prescribe return [FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:] when instead they should be\n[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:];\n  return YES;\nin the general case.\nThen advanced cases could be like\nif ([FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]) { \n         //FB Handled, can short-circuit\n        return YES;\n    }\n    // else do any other custom logic with URLs\n    return YES.\nDoes that make sense or am I overlooking something else?\n. > If the URL is recognized by FBSDK and handled in -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: (as it is now), then it's appropriate to return NO\nI don't think that's correct. Apple docs say \n\nReturn Value\nNO if the app cannot handle the URL resource or continue a user activity, otherwise return YES\n\nSo if the SDK did handle the URL, we definitely should return YES. As mentioned I think the problem is our samples and docs saying to return the FBSDKApplicationDelegate result, when it should not in cases where developers do custom logic. \nYour workaround of passing nil will prevent the SDK from completing a login flow from a cold start case (i.e., app is killed while user is in Facebook app completing Login Dialog). Instead, you should  just always return YES unless there are specific URLs your app should not handle.\n. > If the app returns YES from didFinishLaunching and it was launched via a URL (e.g. install, kill, and enter launchtest://foo in Safari) then openURL: will be called. If it returns NO, then openURL: won't be called.\nRight, that's documented under the application:openURL:options: docs,\n\nThe return values of those methods can be used to prevent this method from being called. (If the app is already running, only this method is called.)\n\nSo we're still correct in that we should definitely return YES in didFinishLaunching if the SDK handled it. I'll work on updating our samples and docs so that developers should not return the [FBSDKApplicationDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:] result directly.\n. FBSDKApplicationDelegate can only report if the URL was handled by FBSDK. It should not be the final return value for the app delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: - hence my point that we need to update our samples/docs to stop this bad behavior.\nTechnically you're right that in the FB login case, the URL would not need to be passed again to the openURL: (technically an implementation detail that could change) but other apps may want to still do some work in openURL:. The FBSDK url handling logic should be idempotent so it should not matter if it was processed already in the didFinishLaunch. \nAnd returning NO if the URL was handled is opposite of the aforementioned documentation and would probably lead to more confusion.\nSo to be clear, our samples/docs will be updated to read\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n{\n    [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application\n                             didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];\n    return YES;\n}\nwhich would have also helped you avoid this problem in the first place.\n. All the docs and samples should be updated now. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.\n. Cool, can you submit to the :dev branch? That's where we accept pull requests.\n. hey jmah@ - thanks, we accepted this and pushed it in the release today but forgot to accept the actual pull request on the dev branch.\n. cool, can you submit this pull request to the :dev branch? That's where we land pull requests.\n. Thanks for the feedback, I know it's a bit confusing but we updated the comment on the enumeration to describe the new logic - https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/blob/3f844053f6ee50be2d40eb75effac13e1439f9ec/FBSDKLoginKit/FBSDKLoginKit/FBSDKLoginManager.h#L69-L70\nSpecifically the enumeration now describes what options are available to the SDK, rather than the one that is used. It would be nice to rename the enumeration at this point but we cannot for backwards compatibility.\n. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem sufficient. I'm not able to build FBSDKShareKit or FBSDKLoginKit. Both these libs use internal APIs of FBSDKCoreKit by directly importing the FBSDKCoreKit+Internal.h (and we left the .h membership as \"project\" instead of \"private\"). Since ShareKit and LoginKit don't have additional header search paths set, they will fail without the pathing. \nAssuming there's nothing to be done on the BUCK side, we could fix this by either adding a HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) $(SRCROOT)/../FBSDKCoreKit/FBSDKCoreKit/Internal/** to the FacebookSDK-Library.xcconfig or set all the headers to an appropriate \"private\" membership and update the imports to package imports. \n. Thanks, can you submit this against the :dev branch? That's where we accept pull requests. We can probably generalize the fix to all Graph API requests generated by the SDK but this is a great start.\n. Thanks!\n\nfor apps that don't necessary support the current locale of the device\n\nCan you give an example of this?\n. We just released 4.9 which will send the locale for all graph requests. We didn't expose a locale override because you should be able to do so in your app's main.m like\nNSUserDefaults *d = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];\n[d setObject:[NSArray arrayWithObject:@\"fr_CA\"] forKey:@\"AppleLanguages\"];\n[d synchronize];\nreturn UIApplicationMain(argc, argv...\nThanks for bringing this to our attention!\n. Thanks for bringing this to our attention, we've updated the strings with official Hebrew translations. Also, for future reference, please submit requests to our :dev branch. Thanks!\n. Can you submit this against our :dev branch? Thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi, can you describe what Xcode version you're using, if you have specific compiler flags or other settings? Normally the deprecation warnings are emitted when messaging deprecated APIs, not just for declarations and I do not reproduce the warning with Xcode 7.2 (either for SDK compilation, or with an app integrated via Cocoapods 1.0.0-beta2). Also, we accept pull requests against our :dev branch, so if you can provide additional details and still want to submit a request, please submit against the dev branch.\n. Thanks - my tests were targeting iOS 8+ and the warning appears when targeting iOS 9+.\n. Thanks!\n. Can you provide a sample and Podfile you are using? I'm not able to reproduce using Cocoapods 0.39.0 or 1.0.0-beta2. Also, if you do still see the problem, can you submit a pull request to our :dev branch instead? That's where we can accept pull requests. Thanks in advance.\n. Thanks, can you submit against the :dev branch? That's where we accept pull requests.\n. Is there a bug or specific use case that this addresses?\n. Feel free to reopen if you can elaborate more on the purpose on this change. Thanks.\n. Hi, what's the motivation behind this change?\n. I see. Well, the LICENSE file is comprehensive and I'd prefer to keep it all in one place (for example, it would be problematic if we update some language there and forget to do it to the README). That said, I'm glad you're interested in the community and hope you can find some other areas to contribute to. Thanks!\n. Thanks! We actually just fixed this in release-3.24.4 which just got pushed.\n. This is a good idea, and I've made some suggestions inline\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry for the delay, we were a bit busy getting things ready for F8 - this looks good so if you can fix the bug you found I'll be happy to merge it.\n. Thanks for the request. The proposed fix would result in losing all the persisted data; instead, we can generate the sessionID when it's missing. We'll fix it for our next release but I'll leave this open in case others run into the issue in the meantime.\n. We generally have a release once a month so v4.12 will likely be released in mid May but we sometimes issue patches for high priority bugs like crashes. My understanding was that this crash should be avoidable as long as activateApp is called as usual (from the application delegate didBecomeActive) - are you seeing repeated crashes despite that?\n. @lennartstolz - sorry I forgot to follow up, we just released 4.12 the other day with the fix for this issue.\n@geoffmacd - yes, we implemented the fix in 4.12 and I forgot to close this pull request.\nIf anyone else still sees an issue, please feel fee to also file reports to developers.facebook.com/bugs . Thanks!\n. Thanks for submitting - these are good changes but we use xcconfig files instead of inline project settings; I've commented inline on the change.\nAlso, we accept pull requests to our :dev branch. Please resubmit updated changes there.\n. Thanks, this PR is no longer needed as we removed the functions in 4.14. Thanks and good catch.  Can you submit this against our :dev branch instead? It'll get merged back into master afterwards as part of the next release.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, this looks fine (though we generally expect developers to use the latest version of Xcode to build the SDK).\n. We generally require the latest released Xcode to build the SDK, so you should use Xcode 8.\nThat said, can you describe what error occurs in Xcode 7.3 with the existing code?\n. any particular reason for the spaces after each period?\n. Can you surround the statement with #pragma clang diagnostic push and #pragma clang diagnostic pop so that it doesn't suppress other code?\n. Can you surround the statement with #pragma clang diagnostic push and #pragma clang diagnostic pop so that it doesn't suppress other code?\n. great catch, we should actually be checking if the .count != 0\n. Let's just call this accessToken and document that it will default to [FBSDKAccessToken currentAccessToken]\n. let's declare _accessToken as an ivar, and have the property lazily set it to [FBSDKAccessToken currentAccessToken]. That way, we can consistently use the accessToken property (i.e., prevent accidental usage of accessTokenOverride internally)\n. we use xcconfig files, can you move this to FBSDKMessengerShareKit/Configurations/FacebookSDK-Project.xcconfig\n. see above comment\n. similarly, move this to FBSDKMessengerShareKit/Configurations/FacebookSDK-Project-Debug.xcconfig\n. this could go to FBSDKMessengerShareKit/Configurations/FacebookSDK-Project.xcconfig since it'll be used in both Debug and Release configurations\n. Also can be moved to FBSDKMessengerShareKit/Configurations/FacebookSDK-Project.xcconfig\n. ",

Perhaps if you explicitly give an access_token in the request parameters, it should use that over the one of the session you pass?\nBut yeah, the second method seems a bit too much.\nTo make it simpler in the SDK, perhaps some helped methods like [FBRequest postPhotoToPage] or something would be useful as you hinted at. However, perhaps we could just also do something like [FBRequest startWithGraphPath:parameters:HTTPMethod:completionHandler:accessToken:] (note the addition of the last parameter). Perhaps it could even be pageAccessToken: just to immediately alert the dev that it works well for use with Pages?\nEither way, perhaps just added some documentation to the effect of what you said in number one would be good, too?

For me personally, my app doesn't support iOS <5. But if you need a robust solution for iOS 4+, I'd personally strongly recommend cutting SBJSON anyway for this reason and integrating JSONKit as the fallback (or as the only option, given that JSONKit slightly outperforms NSJSONSerialization) instead. You could start with this pull, add fallbacks similar to the previously mentioned pull request, and for bonus points rename JSONKit in a similar fashion to this commit.\nI might try to make a pull request for that, but I don't need the feature myself so it's not a high priority thing for me. :)\n.

(i.e. pre-iOS 6)\n. @onebit  My point is that it seems like the Facebook SDK will break if the accounts framework is specified as required for iOS 5 apps. This was my experience as our app is currently still build for iOS 5. If the accounts framework was specified as required in order to use Twitter accounts, it seems like this would break the Facebook SDK based on the conversation here. But rather than continuing to discuss it, would be just easier if I make at test app and see what happens :)\n. @onebit That's my concern.

    "jmah": "If the URL is recognized by FBSDK and handled in -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: (as it is now), then it's appropriate to return NO. An alternative is to not handle the URL in didFinishLaunching, return YES, and handle it when the app delegate passes through -application:openURL:\u2026. However the URL handling logic on launch and after launch look superficially quite different, so I'm not sure that's equivalent.\nMy workaround for the moment has been to pass nil options to application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: and always return YES, and hope that any Facebook stuff would be handled in the openURL: callback. (That approach should work both before and after this patch.) But I'm doubtful now if FBSDKLoginManager gets correctly invoked by doing this. Can you provide any insight?\nIn your \"advanced cases\" snippet, the delegate should actually be returning NO in both of those instances \u2014\u00a0if the app delegate can handle the URL on launch, then it doesn't also need to receive the -application:openURL:\u2026 delegate callback.\n. The docs are poorly written and I think incorrect in this case. I made a sample project (linked) to verify the behavior. If the app returns YES from didFinishLaunching and it was launched via a URL (e.g. install, kill, and enter launchtest://foo in Safari) then openURL: will be called. If it returns NO, then openURL: won't be called.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bzd1gbb0hpcujpt/launchtest.zip?dl=0\n. If the app is launched via a login callback URL, that appears to be handled by code in [FBSDKApplicationDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:] and there's no need to receive that URL again via -application:openURL:options: \u2014\u00a0so the former should return NO. Am I missing something?\n. Ok agreed! It would be a bit weird to have the return value of the method mean something different than the actual delegate method, so perhaps it could get a different name or be changed to return void but that may be uglier overall.\n.

    "mangofever": "Sorry, I've been off for long time.\nI think it's great!\nNice work, @NicholasTD07.\nI hope this pr is merged ASAP.. Oh, just one little thing.\nIn my thought,\nit seems safer to return early when \"targetURL = nil\".. @NicholasTD07 Yeah, I understood that from your pervious comment about that. And also I agree with that. So I don't strongly suggest that code should be changed but... from early-return code already written above it, it might be okay, I think. Just a small thought.. Hi, @NicholasTD07 \nI'm experiencing this crash, currently.\nIn my opinion, it would be better if code is like below:\nNSString * targetURLString = applinkData[@\"target_url\"];\nif (![targetURLString isKindOfClass: [NSString class]]) {\n     return;\n}\nNSURL *targetURL = [NSURL URLWithString:targetURLString];. ",
    "NicholasTD07": "@mangofever Thanks!. @mangofever If early returning there, there's a bunch of unrelated logging that will be skipped and they are not affected by an nil targetURL.. @mangofever The early returns above this part make sense because all the following logging need appLinkData. If there is no appLinkData then there's nothing to log. But targetURL is only a subset of appLinkData. Even if it is nil, there are other parts of data can be logged.. @chrisp-fb \nHi Chris,\nI am seeing some crashes in our app caused by the bug that's fixed in this PR and I would like this fix merged ASAP.\nI am wondering\n\nWhat's the general process for PRs to get merged in this repo?\nWhat needs to be done to get this PR merged?\n\nPS.\nIt seems to me that you have been merging PRs in this repo. So I pinged you. Let me know who to talk to if I pinged the wrong person. :)\nThanks\nNicholas. Thanks everyone for your help. . Thanks for the comment. I definitely see the reason behind your suggestion. We can avoid early exiting this method by being a bit cleverer. :) \nWith the snippet above, there's a possible situation that targetURL is initialized with an nil. \nYou can write [NSURL URLWithString: nil]; and it compiles, but Xcode will give you this warning Null passed to a callee that requires a non-null argument. Xcode is telling us we should not pass an nil value into that method and I do like to keep the warnings in a codebase as few as possible and to call methods properly.\nI think I might have an solution to avoid that situation (initializing NSURL with nil).\nWhat do you think of the following?\n```objective-c\n  NSURL *targetURL;\n  NSString * targetURLString = applinkData[@\"target_url\"];\nif (targetURLString == nil || ![targetURLString isKindOfClass: [NSString class]]) {\n     targetURL = nil;\n  } else {\n    targetURL = [NSURL URLWithString:applinkData[@\"target_url\"]];\n  }\n```\nThis way, we do not early exit this method even when targetURLString is nil or is not of type NSString and we do not crash the SDK plus the apps.. @mangofever I have updated the code to include the change proposed above. Please review again. Thanks.. ",

Is anyone of you having issues after this change?\nI tried installing pods like this but I get old versions (4.38.0) for some of the feature \npod 'FacebookSDK'\n    pod 'FBSDKCoreKit'\n    pod 'FBSDKShareKit'\n    pod 'FBSDKLoginKit'\nIf I try to install like this, I get some missing files\npod 'FacebookSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/facebook/facebook-objc-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'\n    pod 'FBSDKCoreKit', :git => 'https://github.com/facebook/facebook-objc-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'\n    pod 'FBSDKShareKit', :git => 'https://github.com/facebook/facebook-objc-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'\n    pod 'FBSDKLoginKit', :git => 'https://github.com/facebook/facebook-objc-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'\ni.e. FBSDKWebViewAppLinkResolver.h: No such file or directory\nEvery time I update pods for FBSDK, I run into one issue or another. Please guys let me know if I am doing something wrong or someone else is not testing after all the changes.\nI cleaned all my cache for pods and reinstalled everything and still face issue. Please guide if I am doing something wrong. . ",

Rather than having this, I'd prefer sticking with the default UISearchBar implementation (which disables the search button until there's some text, even if that text is a space)... If a user wants to search for just a space, that's ok, the SDK will just return things near the location..
