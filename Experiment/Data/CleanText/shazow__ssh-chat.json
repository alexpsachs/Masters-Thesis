HMM interesting, any idea how this looks like on lesser terminals?\nAlso will need to rebase this. Will merge other PRs first.\n. Cute! Thanks! :)\n. Good idea.\n. Good call, thanks!\n. Why? Doesn't ssh use md5 by default, or am I mistaken? I wanna show the same fingerprints you get when you ssh into a host.\n. Well, find out what ssh clients use, if it's sha1 then I'll merge it. :)\n. Let's do this after we complete #19 and migrate in one fell swoop.\nAlso maybe allow for specifying the full pubkey, not just fingerprint.\n. Oops forgot to close this now that the refactor branch is merged. But yea, this is done.\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/sshd/auth.go#L67\n@freewil Maybe we saw the same tweet. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Good call, thanks!\n. Hm, try again? Might have been a bad commit.\n. Btw, what version of Go? We're targeting 1.4 (or 1.3 at least) I think.\n. Yay glad it works!\n. Sick. I love it.\n. In general.\nWhen we use the name as an index in our map[string]..., we should lowercase the key before inserting/comparing.\n. Fast like :zap: \n. In fact, it was a little bit :ghost:\n. Why not put a space in front of it? I'd prefer to stick more true to traditional IRC behavior.\n. I GUESS! I'd like to support reserving names and marking admins in a similar fashion, but we can add it later.\nAlso I'd suggest supporting pubkey signatures, similar to ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Easier to fill them from github profiles and whatnot.\n. pubkeys for future PR is cool. :)\n. Done. It accepts authorized_keys-style files now.\n. @Fastidious Added a section here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#can-i-block-users-from-connecting-how-do-i-assign-admins\nBasically it's one pubkey per line, as you wrote it.\n. TY\n. Good call, thanks!\n. This way we can shove in some classy ascii art into it, like a banner.\n. Neat!\nI kinda like people not being able to control their colors. Let's keep it that way. :)\n. Or how about we just remove black colors from being chosen instead? :)\n. If we'd like to avoid having the same color as somebody else, we could make the colors cycle rather than be random, but I don't think it's worth doing that.\n. Well isn't black near the edge, couldn't you make the number smaller/make an offset? :)\n. Ooo neat chart, thanks.\nRe white terminals, turning off colors will help for now. Later adding more themes will help (dark vs light).\nWonder if there's a golang library that has some of this color stuff figured out... Wanna search? :D\n. Right you are. :) Fixing.\n. You can keep the same PR (branch) if you'd prefer; it can be easier to keep discussion context that way.\nIf you're worried about commit history, I can squash before merging (but I generally don't care).\n. Hey, thanks for this, very cool!\nI'm reluctant in merging a feature like this right now, I think there are a lot of open questions (e.g. how do you handle presence in multiple channels?) and I'm not sure it's a necessary feature just yet (1 server per channel is not too bad).\nBut you're welcome to continue developing this in your fork. I would be interested to hear how you're using this. :)\n. I appreciate the thought, it's a cool idea. :)\nOn Dec 13, 2014 7:18 PM, \"Evgeniy Vasilev\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSure, it was just proof of concept.

Looks good, thanks! :) Fix that typo and I'll hit the button.\n. Lovely, thanks! Wanna do the same in history.go? :D\n. Hm wanna rebase so I can hit the button? :D\n. Yay!\n. Now need to make a nice ascii banner.\n. Same idea as #31. Very cool, but out of scope for the project as it is right now. Maybe sometime in the future. :)\n. Could allow for specifying a theme (start with just two themes, mono and color). Either way.\n. Good call, thanks.\n. Seems like a lot of work, but it's not clear to me for what, can you explain?\n\nWe just added reading MOTD from a file, which lets you write longer intros. Does this improve anything over that?\n. > 1. Adds a /clear command which resets the screen (useful if you want to keep track of what you have read or not)\nTerminals already let you do this with ctrl+L.\n\n\nRather than only sending the last 10 lines of history when you log in, it will detect the height of your terminal and send that amount of previously received messages (up to 80 lines)\n\n\nI don't think this is necessarily better. This might overwhelm a lot of people if they see a wall of text as soon as they join.\n\n\nGives you one of the following messages whenever you log in (depending on how many other users are in the room):\n\"You are all alone in here.\"\n\"At least you have shazow to keep you company.\"\n\"There are currently 12 users chatting.\"\n\n\nThat's cute, and I'd be happy if you maintained this in your own chat server, but I rather not keep this as part of the main implementation. :) I rather keep the master branch more generic and simple.\n. You do know how many people are in the room with you,\n...\n * shazow joined. (Total connected: 41)\n-> Welcome to ssh-chat. Enter /help for more.\n. ~~I actually like the idea that it's possible but not trivial to change your color. I rather not allow people spamming color changes (we already have enough problems with people spamming renames).~~\n. Oh this turns off color, not changes it. Interesting.\n. Would probably be better to not color in the first place rather than de-color after the fact (if color is turned off).\n. > So change the default to no color at all?\nSorry, I meant that instead of applying colors to strings and then stripping colors off if people don't want them, we shouldn't be applying colors to strings in the first place if people don't want them.\nUltimately this should also allow us to apply different kinds of colors for people on demand, based on selected themes.\nThat aside, I believe colors should be on by default.\nThis improvement might be better for a separate PR though, what do you think?\n. Mmm yea I think we might need a big refactor to handle coloring on-demand. Let's go forward with this as-is for now, then.\n. Oh btw, wanna add the /theme command to the help text?\n. Thank you! :)\n. Fixed in #54.\n. Not right now, I think.\nWe still haven't chosen our storage mechanism for persisting state. Let's do this piece afterwards. :)\nI opened an issue: #47\n. Hey @JeanSebTr, that looks really nice, thank you!\nI'm actually planning on rewriting that whole section of code myself also. Do you might if I hang onto this PR as a reference? I had a different idea for how to structure the code and I'd like to give it a try. (Unfortunately this will probably have to wait until next week.)\n. This is done within the refactor branch that was merged.\n. Thank you! :)\n. sqlite is my least favorite choice right now as relational schema-enforced is not beneficial for the problem at hand and adds a fair bit of code complexity to setup, maintain, and query.\nI don't believe there is a need for a config file just yet, as long as the command-line flags remain simple enough.\nI can confidently say that we are definitely not touching XML for anything. :)\n. Decoupling makes sense when you have something to decouple, it's still too early to even know what we want to store or what we'll do with it. Further, depends which storage backend we choose will dictate how simple/complex the usage of it is and how we implement the feature.\nYou're welcome to tackle and propose an interface, but I suspect it's going to change a lot before it's put into use. :/\n. Hopefully fixed by #50, will re-open otherwise.\n. Looks like this is still a problem, we've more pprof'ing to do. /cc @empathetic-alligator \n. Hmm might not be a problem actually, garbage collector doing garbage collecty things. Will leave it running for a while longer. Note to self: run with pprof.\n. Should be much better as of v1.2\n. @empathetic-alligator You're a fantastic human being, thank you!\n\nI used pprof to find it, should it be permanently enabled? The only problem is that an http server must be running in the background. Should I add a command line arg that turns it on?\n\nYea I was thinking adding an optional --pprof <port>, what do you think? (Maybe diff PR)\n. Nice! Can you please rebase against the latest master so that I can hit the big red merge button? :D\nThank you again!\n. Wonderful, thank you!\nIf you can find a way to make travisci fail on linting errors, that'd be great. :)\n. Excellent, one nit. :)\n. Also failing our new stricter travisci lint tests: https://travis-ci.org/shazow/ssh-chat/builds/44044384\n. Excellent!\n. I like this solution, thank you. :)\n. Thank you!\n. I think that's a good idea. I want to try to do this next week too, but if you want to try and beat me to it, have at it! :)\n. Not yet.\nJust a warning, I'm going to be going offline until next week and possibly reworking this while I'm away. There's a good chance I'll do this while I'm offline, but you're welcome to try as well if you don't mind the chance of being superseded. :)\n. Done.\n. aquilax claims it's working now, yay! http://i.imgur.com/II14xR5.png\n. @empathetic-alligator Just restarted with the new version an hour ago, so give it a try again.\n@aquilax Any tips?\n. Shippin' it! Thank you.\n. @empathetic-alligator I would adore a better fix. :) This is the only workaround we could think of.\n. Clearly there are a lot of options, need to pick something sensible.\nI like the idea of being notified wherever I'm mentioned, making mentioners have to prefix with @ to know I got notified feels like an unnecessary thing to educate them on. :/\n. Regexp has been vastly improved in the new version.\n. Whitelist implies that nobody except people in the whitelist can join, so that's still fine.\nAs far as banning goes, yes it wouldn't work anymore. I have mixed feelings about implementing ip-based banning as opposed to using something like iptables.\nEither way, I'd like to support no-pubkey connections, at least optionally (might add a flag later). Thank you for this. :)\n. @songgao Oh can you send a PR that rejects no-pubkey connections if whitelist is defined?\n. Maybe something like:\ngo\nif !server.IsWhitelisted(\"\") {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"Not Whitelisted.\")\n}\nIf there is no whitelist, it should do the Right Thing I think.\n. Not yet.\nOn Dec 16, 2014 4:27 PM, \"persontwo\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHas the server been restarted since PR#62 was merged?

Thanks for reporting, that's no fun. :)\n. Done.\n. Thank you! Very important feature. :)\n. Will take a look at this later. FYI, in the future, you don't have to open a new PR just to change stuff. Feel free to force-push to overwrite commit history if you're worried about it. I'm not too worried about commit history purity, though.\n. git commit --amend to merge into the previous commit, then git push origin $branch --force.\n\nAlternatively, you can push your new branch into the old branch: git push origin $newbranch:$oldbranch --force.\n. NP. :) Will take a look at PRs tomorrow, taking a day off ssh-chat otherwise (as you can tell lol).\n. Some good ideas, but what do you think about doing something like #44 instead?\nI plan to do this kind of refactor myself soon, maybe it'd be best to leave it off until then.\n. Thanks @peterhellberg. Sorry for not giving this feedback earlier. :)\n. I've thought about this but I leaned towards not including it. The main reason to include it on-join is to alert the joining user how many people are in the room with him/her. For leaving, there's no point. If someone who is already in the room wants to know, they can always do /list. :)\nThank you though, I appreciate the effort!\n. Crafty, thanks.\n. This will still tab-complete to lowercase names rather than properly-cased names, right? Can we fix that too?\n. Thank you for pinging! :)\nLooks good, can you rebase against master, looks like there are some merge conflicts. I think we added a RWLock around iterating over clients.\n. Perfect, thank you!\n. There is no name \"registration\" yet, that will come as a feature in the future once the plumbing is done. :)\n. @empathetic-alligator Good stuff, thank you. Left some review comments. Happy to merge this after we clean up the code. :)\n. Not a problem, I appreciate you getting involved. :)\n. Please ping me when I should take a look at it again. :)\n. Looks great, thank you! :)\n. /cc @jazzychad Check this out.\n. Saw this in the logs yesterday after the server crashed.\nI don't believe the server was shutting down, except for this crash. There were many hundreds of lines of traceback from various goroutines\u2014we might also be leaking goroutines. :p\n. Should be fixed in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/b90017bfe6f96252e9db96bb972d27f2c7246a66\n. Yup this is planned, thank you for tracking it.\nCurrently blocked on #47 (feel free to join the discussion).\nThis will likely be an optional feature, possibly not enabled on public servers, or maybe users will need to ask for permission from ops to be able to register their nicks.\n. More thoughts on this as I'm starting to spec it out:\nUser registration and out-of-band notifications\nYou'll be able to type /register myemail@domain.com and it will attach your pubkey to your email (after sending off a validation email and confirming ownership through another command). The benefit of registration is you get offline presence (aka you appear as in-chat even if you disconnect) and you get instant email notifications of mentions and emails of conversation summaries of what you missed (hourly/daily maybe). Possibly do push notifications too (through pushbullet or something else).\n. When email notifications get sent, they're going to include a \"safe\" unencrypted section, and the context of the notification will be encrypted below if you want to read it without reconnecting. Something like this:\n\nYou were mentioned on chat.shazow.net.\nConnect to the server to read the notification, or run the command below to decrypt the context:\n$ openssl command to decrypt using your ssh privkey << EOF\n[[encrypted base64 blob to your ssh pubkey]]\nEOF\n. A quick update: There's some progress in the refactor branch towards design changes that are required for this, but I'd say it's still around 50% done. I'm not actively working on this right now so it might be a while.. Done.\n. Merged the giant refactor branch into master, preparing for v1.0 release. \n. Just release v1.1 with binary builds. Still lots of work to do, but tests pass and there are no detected race conditions, it doesn't crash in trivial cases anymore, and we have 46.6% coverage across modules. While not all of the TODOs are completed, I think it's in a good state and good enough to close this issue for now.\n. Sorry I just beat you to it. :)\n\nAlso I don't think we need to check for \"\", because that's a nice easy way to disable no-auth logins (banning \"\" fingerprint).\n. I'll fix that, thanks!\n. Fixed in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/8bba2e391797ad21f1dc4ae3751f6ab9a8744791 among other things.\n. @empathetic-alligator Glad you asked! I have some great news for you. I wrote precisely that piece yesterday, but I don't have the piece you're working on. :)\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-hammer\nFeel free to steal any/all of that code, or contribute back to it. Whatever makes sense.\n. Btw, in case it wasn't clear, please don't use this on the live chat.shazow.net, your IP will get blacklisted by iptables. :)\n. Take a look at https://github.com/peterhellberg/check-ssh-chat, too.\n. Tests are in a much better state now, yay.\n. Thanks!\n. Using this script with my fork of it:\n``` bash\n!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    echo \"$(date): Checking...\"\n    if check-ssh-chat -t 10s -v -h localhost -p 22 -n \"ghost-of-shazow\"; then\n        sleep 3600\n        continue\n    fi\necho \"KILLING!!\"\npkill -2 -f ssh-chat\nsleep 30\n\ndone\n```\n. Thank you, can you post which commit version you were using? Seems your fork is 20 commits behind the upstream, we might have fixed this bug. :)\n. Yes that bug happened on the latest upstream master, or yes the bug might have been fixed?\n. Ah fair enough, I think we might have fixed it then (I pursued several bugs yesterday). Can you sync to latest master and let me know if this happens again? :D\n. Did the server hang for you when you did this? Or did you write this comment in the wrong issue?\n. @vectorijk This issue is about the server hanging, please open a separate issue?\n. Hopefully fixed in master.\n. Wonderful. :)\n. You'll probably need v1.3 or newer, since we're using http timeouts for a recent feature.\n. Excellent! Also it runs far better on the latest versions. :) I ran it on 1.2 for a while and it was leaking memory and such, I think related to one of the std crypto libs we were using.\n. Pinging top contributors, in case you feel like looking around and giving some feedback. :) Open to ideas for the rewrite.\n/cc @empathetic-alligator, @Kealper, @IQAndreas, @jazzychad\n. Just added a bunch of work. Should be almost at feature parity, would love it if people tried it and let me know how it is. Things I need to add:\n- [x] Name sanitizing\n- [x] Uptime/version\nAnything else?\n. YAY IT'S MERGED!\nNot super battle tested yet, but ready for trial by combat.\n. Mmm yea, nicks get unwhitelisted characters stripped, we should do that before announcing.\n. Oops opened #92 as dupe, fixed now tho.\n. Hmm interesting, I wonder if it's related to us not handling the shell channel properly. Thanks for filing! Would appreciate any help looking into this.\n. Please give it a try on v1.1 and re-open if it's still a problem. :)\n. Fixed in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/tree/refactor with aliases. :)\n. OKAAAY. :P\n. Should be good now, lmk if it doesn't work.\n. I'm afraid it's out of scope for this particular project, but feel free to fork and implement your own version (I suggest starting from the refactor branch, which will be v1.0 soon).\nFor now, you can host multiple instances of these and call each one a channel. :)\n. FWIW, I'd avoid mixing IRC-style and Unix-style commands. Stick with IRC, it already has commands for all of this.\n. Aha, thanks for doing it for this branch, you rock. :)\n. Might be fun to add const/iota types to messages for extra annotation/filtering, will think about this...\n. Can you rebase so that I can hit the big green button? :D\n. ty. just refactored that and didn't catch all the type assertions yet. :)\n. Ah thanks for doing this!\nHmm, can you think of other cli tools that solve it this way? Not sure it's a good idea to accept a password through a cli flag as it will show up in the process list and leak the password. Stdin is fine. Environment variable possibly.\n. It would be possible, but we decided not to in this particular project. We feel the experience is more magical without timestamps.\n. Thank you!\n. You're awesome!\n. Done.\n. :custard: thank you\n. What distinguishes a human interface from a bot interface? Are we going to start presenting CAPTCHAs? :)\n. Ah, well there is /theme mono which removes all colors. No plans for JSON yet, though. Maybe someday.\n. There is no way to force bots to identify themselves as such, /mute command will come eventually to let you silence whoever you don't like. We can also add better throttling heuristics if anyone has ideas.\nMost likely implementation of a non-human interface is maybe something like TERM=bot env variable which will skip PTY handling and won't set a prompt.\n. I was thinking of exposing the TERM variable in the /whois (any objections?), so that may help further in identifying people vs bots.\n. @chexo3 This is unrelated to bash, it's your terminal (that you might run bash inside).\nNo, I don't think there should be security implications. But someone correct me if I'm wrong.\n. IMO setting a TERM variable to bot or readline something would be the cleanest thing to do.\n. That's nothing to do with ssh-chat, that's screen. You need to do ctrl+a, ctrl+d to scrawl with pgup/down.\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/scroll-up-down-look-at-data-in-gnuscreen-using-pageup-pagedown-keys/\n. Thanks. :)\n. You're welcome to fork this project and maintain a version of it that has these things, but it's out of scope for the mainline version. :)\n. Your bikeshed is lovely, thank you!\n. One thing that could be improved if you're up for it is to print the host/port based on the socket that actually gets allocated, that way it'll do the Right Thing when you specify port 0 (random available port).\n. Hmm strange, maybe try a fresh $GOPATH? I suggest something like...\n$ export GOPATH=$PWD/pkg\n$ go get github.com/shazow/ssh-chat\n. No, you don't need root unless you run ssh-chat on port 22. You definitely\ndon't need root to just build it.\nOn Jan 4, 2015 10:55 PM, \"devNET software group\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nYes, it needs root.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/110#issuecomment-68674187.\n. Let me know if this is still happening.\n. Would be cool if we had somekind of continuous builds setup, I think there are some services that do this. For now, a Docker image might suffice.\n. @smiller171 I don't think we need docker for this, but you're welcome to help. :) We need a GOARCH/GOOS build matrix and then publish the binaries somewhere (maybe github releases).\n. Thank you! Feel free to submit an in-progress PR for early feedback (just mark it as WIP in the title).\n. Not quite continuous, but I have some scripts to generate packaged binary releases. Good enough for now! https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases\n. :revolving_hearts: \n. We're just piggybacking on golang's crypto/ssh library for these things. Would need to fork it to add that support, or report the bug to them. Sorries.\n\nhttps://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#pkg-constants\n. Fixed.\n. What version of Go? Need v1.3 or newer.\n. Type go version.\n. Maybe try a fresh Go environment? Something like...\n$ export GOPATH=$HOME/Go2\n$ go get github.com/shazow/ssh-chat\n. Sorry I'm out of ideas. :/ Try building Go from source? Or ask somebody on #go-nuts on freenode IRC?\nLet me know if you figure it out.\n. When you go get ..., it builds it from source.\nAnyways, if you get a copy of the repo, you can do:\n$ go get .\n$ go build ./...\n. Make sure you're in the directory of the ssh-chat source code.\n. You'll need to do go get . to get all the dependencies first, then build.\nOn Tue, Jan 13, 2015 at 1:52 PM, chexo3 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nLast login: Tue Jan 13 16:48:36 on ttys000\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~]-04:50 PM > export GOPATH=/Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~]-04:50 PM > go build ./...\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/cmd.go:13:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/cmd.go:14:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/cmd.go:15:2: cannot find package \"github.com/jessevdk/go-flags\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/client.go:9:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/client.go:10:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOPATH)\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~]-04:51 PM > cd /Users/isaacbeckett/ssh-chat/go/src\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~/ssh-chat/go/src]-04:51 PM > go build ./...\nssh-chat/cmd.go:13:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/cmd.go:14:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/cmd.go:15:2: cannot find package \"github.com/jessevdk/go-flags\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/client.go:9:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/client.go:10:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOPATH)\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~/ssh-chat/go/src]-04:51 PM >\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/115#issuecomment-69827656.\n. ssh-chat is installed in $GOPATH/bin.\n.

I wrote a little library to handle rate limiting at the net.Conn level: https://godoc.org/github.com/shazow/rateio\n. Fixed in the latest master.\n. Eeeh, yolomerging.\n. @swecide There is socket read rate limiting. I kinda eyeballed the default values right now, but it's likely we'll need to tweak it more. Can you tell me more about your behaviour? Is the message hand-typed, or program-generated?\nThe default is here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/sshd/net.go#L31 (That's 10kb per 2 minutes, with a 3 second grace period in the beginning.)\nRegarding not being able to join again, that shouldn't happen unless you banned yourself somehow. There's no auto-ban yet.\n. @swecide Can you be more specific, like how long are the messages?\nI need to get better benchmarks on how many bytes ssh sends per character. But I figure allowing 150-200 chars/minute is fairly safe?\nIt may vary with encryption/compression types, though. Hmmm.\n. Hmm that shouldn't happen. Are you able to reproduce it?\nI just tried the same messages on my own local server and it didn't kick me. I had to paste it about 30 times before I got kicked.\n. Yea not clue what's going on here. I'll try to add some logging when somebody is kicked, stay tuned (on vacation atm, might be a while).\n. Okay, tracked down the problem. Each character is ~52 bytes when sent separately (ie. keystrokes, vs copypasta). I'll need to add a different Limiter to the RateLimited connection which does counts # reads rather than # bytes (unless it's a really big read). Will fix soon. :)\n. Thank you!\n. This is already a thing. You need to be an admin to /kick or /ban users.\nYou can add initial admins by supplying a file with their public key using the --admin flag. After that, you can /admin people.\n. No worries. :)\n. Appreciate the suggestion!\nI think a better approach to have pre-built binaries people can download. See #111.\n. Yup, I'm familiar with brew. I've been using it for years on my OSX. Unfortunately, it's only relevant to OSX.\nWhy would a .pkg work better?\nGolang can compile binaries for all platforms, not just *nix.\nI'm not going to stop you from making a Brew recipe for ssh-chat, I'm just saying it's not something I'm going to pursue. :)\n. You might be mistaking what a golang-built binary is. The tarball download you're asking for is exactly what it is. I'm not sure what difference you're drawing between a *nix binary and a prebuilt binary and a .pkg native format.\nAlso, you need git for brew to work regardless (albeit brew installs it for you). Anyways, feel free to make whatever recipe you'd like. :)\n. > I mean a nix binary is for nix systems, it is prebuilt as well, but you would need to decompile it and recompile on a mac to use it on a mac\nThat's not how it works. You don't decompile anything. Go builds binaries for target platforms. You can build one for each of Linux, Mac, Windows.\n\nWhat version is ssh-chat at?\n\nWhat do you mean? The latest commit hash is the version right now. Vaguely v1.x.\n. Good find, fixed! \n. Ban user/ip already exists.\nChannels is out of scope for this fork, but you're welcome to add it yourself. :)\n. I appreciate the thought but I don't want to introduce remote code execution to ssh-chat as that would open up a big can of vulnerabilities for us to fight against. :)\n. I forget, it might already be possible to pipe things. It'll likely trigger anti-spam throttling, though.\n. Nevermind, I think we disabled that because people were having too much fun piping in junk.\n. @chexo3 This is not something I need, but you're welcome to do that in your fork. :) You may need to implement a handler for the exec channel request type to do what @aminehmida proposed.\n. @fjarlq As you noticed, this package is a bit stale as it's not actively being worked on at the moment. I appreciate you diving in and cleaning up, very welcome improvements. :)\nThank you again!\n. Thank you!\n. Can we make this only run on the master branch after the PRs have been merged, in a separate suite?\nI still want to keep travisci tests for PRs.\n. > You need to set DOCKER_USER, DOCKER_EMAIL, and DOCKER_PASS environment variables in Travis for it to push the image to Docker Hub\nDoes it make any sense to do this? I don't want to let everyone in the world push to my docker hub account. Or can I do this privately in my travis account?\n. What version of Go are you running? What OS?\n. Yea looks like the tests are hanging, probably a deadlock. Not sure why. We should add a -timeout 10s or something to the go test command. Default is 10min which is a bit cray.\n. If you can identify how you reproduce the failures on a specific platform, please open an issue. :)\n. Removed docker releases in favour of binary releases, can be easily wrapped with any blank docker now.\n. Can't reproduce. Maybe your internet connection is blocking outbound SSH? Could try it from a different network.\n. Oh, if you're connecting but getting permission denied, it's possible your ssh key got banned. You can try a fresh key. :)\n. ssh-chat accepts an optional whitelist of public keys. chat.shazow.net does not operate with a whitelist, so all public keys are accepted unless they're invalid/banned.\n. You too, happy chatting! :)\n. Umm, you could run ssh from bash to ssh into your ssh-chat server. :) Or read the logs.\n. Start it on a different port?\n. ssh-chat is not a client, it's a server. Having users run ssh-chat is not going to do what you want. ssh is a client for ssh-chat (the server). ssh is also a client for sshd (the server).\nNormal sshd and ssh-chat can't share a port right now, you'd need to write a multiplexer of somekind.\n. Thank you!\n. Glad you like it, enjoy! :)\n. @epitron Btw you're from Toronto? I'm moving back to Toronto in a few months, we should grab a beverage.\n. Hey there, the demo server is running v0 (version before a major refactor). You're welcome to try out that branch!\nBetter yet, if you can find what's causing the bug, I'd appreciate a fix. :)\n. I believe there's a --pprof flag which starts ssh-chat with a pprof server that you should be able to inspect after it becomes unresponsive. That output should give us a hint of what's going on, maybe there's a run-away goroutine cluster or a blocked channel somewhere.\n. Glad you like it and thanks for helping out! I'm actually also working on a custom irc server that I hope to combine someday. >.>\n. Btw couple more things, might be worth making a build with the race detector enabled (-race). Also hope you're using Go 1.6, it has some improved stack output that will be easier to parse.\n. No, master should have more features but v0 might be more stable.\n\"won't run\" is just not enough information to help. :) Is there an error, maybe?\n. You're not running it in the pasta?\n. Er sorry, pasta is slang for copy-paste. :)\nYou pasted the commands you typed to build ssh-chat, but you say it won't run and you didn't include anything about running it? Is there an error? With what you're sharing, I just have no information about what is going wrong, all I have is your word telling me it's not working. :)\n. You're welcome. :) Hope you'll have the opportunity to dig into why master is failing for you.\n. --whitelist= flag, see --help\n. Should be fixed in v1.1, give it a try. :)\n. Which version did you try? Latest master has the new format iirc.\n. Well, my \"reference server\" is a bit out of date. :)\n[shazow] /uptime\n-> 11017h53m7.906117303s\n. Indeed it would, but alas keybase does not do anything with ssh pubkeys so it doesn't really fit. :( Related issue: https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/710\nAlso PM me your email address and I'll send you an invite. :)\n. Hmm so it's not bindable from 0.0.0.0:2022 locally? That's frustrating. Honestly not sure what the problem is here, would appreciate any help with debugging. :)\n. Can anyone confirm if this is still a problem with v1.1? Check the latest binary release here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases\nPlease re-open the issue if its.\n. Ah you probably want a more modern Go, 1.3 is several years old. Try to get 1.5 or newer.\n. @jbenet I like the idea but not comfortable rewriting imports to use ipfs for a non-ipfs-related project though. (Not yet at least.) :)\n. @jbenet:\n1. I don't feel the transport should be hardcoded into the import namespace. I think this is consistent with Go's decision to exclude http(s)://, git:// etc from the import statements, and adding ipfs:// or similar (even /ipfs/...) would be a regression in that direction.\n2. I don't want to require an additional non-ubiquitous service that is largely unrelated to golang dev just to build the project. If it was an optional enhancement, that'd be cool.\nReally a pinning/lock file is probably the way to go, where aware tools can fetch the dependencies from the best possible source (yay ipfs if available!) but still fall back to the normal golang vendoring/namespacing mechanics.\n. > gx works out of the box without ipfs, it uses http from the ipfs.io gateway. (think of it as our github.com or our npm), but it verifies all the content is correct, and version locks.\nFair point. My ideal dep tool degrades gracefully to not requiring any external tools but adds value when available.\nThe package mapping thing will put it at a place where it could work, though!\n. Should be fixed with https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/838f58e648b30bbf2ee2b9351fdf92bd1eb6a333\n. Which version of ssh-chat are you using? The latest master?\n. Cool cool. Any interest in helping debug? :) I'm not actively working on ssh-chat right now but I'd be happy to review PRs and point you in the right direction.\n. No worries, thanks for reporting it! I'll take a look at this if I pick up the project again, but can't promise a timeline. Maybe someone will beat me to it! :)\n. Fixed in v1.1, weee.\n. I'm going to be working on fixing some panic/crash bugs in master, and I want to add email notifications. Also binary builds releases.\n. Let's say starting around 1pm EST? Also changed the tentative date to Sat July 9th. I'll likely continue doing some work into June 10th and a bit onwards if people want to keep going remotely. :)\n. @0x004a \n\nWhen typing a line wider than terminal width, it skips a line. (not sure why)\n\nIt's a known issue in the terminal stdlib we're using unfortunately, related info here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/22\n. Hey everyone, hope you're ready to hack on ssh-chat this weekend!\nI'm super busy with moving back to Canadia but I'm making time for this. Looking forward to pushing out some fun features. :)\n. Okay it'shappening.gif, join the main ssh-chat server to participate.\nsh\n$ ssh chat.shazow.net\n. Hey everyone, thanks for those of you who came online to hack with me. :D We got some stuff done:\n- @prologic wrote keepalive code that I'm excited to merge soon (feedback pending), and some other good-spirited submissions.\n- @mcroydon cheered us on from the sidelines.\n- My buddy Ted hung out and learned Go next to me (I helped a bit!)\n- I wrote a script to package up binary releases so that people can stop complaining about having to use Go to run ssh-chat.\nThis date snuck up on me this time around but I'd like to do this again soon. I'm going to keep hacking on stuff on and off until then. Will ping this thread for the next hackathon. :heart:\n. Have you tried setting your GOPATH environment variable? :)\nSome instructions here: https://golang.org/doc/install#testing\nIdeally we'll be providing binaries so you don't need to build it from scratch, but that's not done yet. Sorry.\n. See the link I shared. It's Go's \"workspace\", it's where it will download the dependencies into, build/compile, etc.\n. Mentions with tab-complete are already supported, no @ necessary. :)\n. There is a --whitelist flag which accepts a list of public keys that are allowed to connect. I believe whitelisting can also occur by admins while the server is running with /whitelist but it's ephemeral for now.\n. Fixed.\n. Do you think we could get away with just doing something like this instead?\ngo\n// in sshd/terminal.go:NewTerminal\n...\ngo func() {\n    for range time.Tick(keepaliveInterval) {\n        _, err := channel.SendRequest(\"keepalive\", true, nil)\n        if err != nil {\n            // We'll get an err when the channel is closed, so this goroutine\n            // will clean up itself. Bonus points for catching a specific err.\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}()\nMight be a bit nicer since we avoid introducing more parameters/state to unrelated functions.\n. When the client disconnects. If the goroutine returns, it will get cleaned\nup.\nOn Jul 10, 2016 1:02 PM, \"James Mills\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMaybe :) Are we worried at all about cleaning up the goroutines on client\ndisconnect or server termination? Or do we rely on GC for that?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/pull/147#issuecomment-231599202, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AAAYlJDNLrZ_PsCY7lDrlPLJyVERadwcks5qUSWegaJpZM4JIvMa\n.\n. Merged the proposed variant in 8b9ebbdb6b27f0a00880bd72446e9cac08a4091e, thank you. :)\n. Any concrete benefits here or just your preference?\n\nAs it is, the godoc that gets generated is fairly small and easy to follow, I would prefer to avoid hiding core/required components (auth, host) into more subpackages until things get too messy (sshchat is practically unusable without them).\nSet is probably the only one that is obvious but I didn't feel making a util package was justified for just this one struct, since it's not very big and it's not being reused by any other subpackages.\nRegarding the logger, note how every subpackage has a copy of that. It wouldn't make sense to subpackage just for the sshchat package.\n. That's pretty standard for Go, the idea is you should be able to import the \"primary\" functionality of a package by importing the root repo, as in:\ngo\nimport \"github.com/shazow/ssh-chat\"\nAgain I super-appreciate this initiative. I'm going to close this for now but let's keep it in mind if things get messier. :)\n. Just realized I already did this in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/838f58e648b30bbf2ee2b9351fdf92bd1eb6a333 and forgot to close the issue, oops!\n. (I decided to skip adding Godep to avoid dependency on a specific third-party tool, the submodule pins should be sufficient for now.)\n. @anarcat ssh-chat is all about reinventing wheels, but I'm very aware of the IRC protocol (I've even implemented my own IRC server but haven't gotten around to v3 extensions yet). Thanks. :)\n. Looks great! How do you feel about using a Set rather than a list of ignored users? (Might need to move it into a shared package.)\nThen we can get rid of IgnoredNames(). Maybe even make it a public attribute on User and avoid having Ignore(...) and Unignore(...) altogether since it's all boilerplate anyways?\n. Yay thank you, that's great. I wish we could get travisci to work again, sighhh.\n. This was done a while ago, I think. (cc @sleibrock). Would you be up for writing a test, too? :)\n. Btw, I fixed travisci on the master branch, so should get proper badges if you rebase. :)\n. Going to do a new release so I made the change myself, hope you don't mind. :) Your changes still got merged, thank you!\n. @aaronwinter Excellent, thank you. Also lots more minor issues cropped off if you're feeling inspired. :)\n. There are themes, try /theme mono. I'm open to adding more themes like light, want to contribute one?\n. Basically https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/theme.go#L176-L186\nCould use a couple more themes, one for solarized, one for light backgrounds.\n. Yea basically we'd need a solarized/light background palette, the rest should be the similar. Btw this little block is handy for debugging: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/theme.go#L189-L192\n. Also the default colourscheme is not readable on iTerm2 using the solarized-dark theme. I think just the system messages, would be good to tweak it a bit (see #178).\n. We now have a hacker and solarized colorscheme, thanks to @sleibrock <3\n. It's a known bug, not sure what we can do about it right now:\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/22\n. Also on-join, chat history messages get injected before the motd.\n. Autocomplete is disabled on the chat2 server until this is fixed.\n. This can be reproduced with Autocomplete enabled by running a server, joining with at least one user, then running cat /dev/urandom | ssh ... a few times.\n. Thank you!\n. Hm fair point, thanks!\n. Also BEL emitting for mentions, bonus points for optional enable/disable.\n. Would be nice to include a few extra things while we're at it, like time since joined and client used (v0 had this).\n. Yea I think that's fine, or make it an incremental improvement later.\n. @C0FFEEC0FFEE Thanks! Is there any way to turn on verbose logging?\n. Weird, thanks for reporting it! Will look into it once the more urgent bugs are fixed, or you're welcome to dive in too. :)\n. @botto I think it might have to do with my aggressive rate limiting and the size of your key. I'll tweak that.\n. @botto @C0FFEEC0FFEE Could you both try this server and let me know if it's better? Port 2222 on chat2.shazow.net:\n$ ssh -p 2222 chat2.shazow.net\n. @botto Can you confirm also?\nOtherwise I'm closing this issue, should be resolved with the next release.\n. That's quite a few bits. :P\nCould you try with a shorter key for funsies?\n. Hmmm might be the iptables configuration I was using. Can you try now?\nAlso could you try running a local release and see if you still have problems?\n. FWIW I had iptables set to disconnect after 10 quick successive tcp flushes, bumped that up to 20.\n. /quiet should do it.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/pull/157, but thank you. :)\n. It does have /names, consider /list a secret alias. :)\n. This will be done in #74.\n. All the normal bash terminal shortcuts should work. HOME key and ctrl+a jump to the beginning of the line, just like bash.\n. Is this a problem on chat2.shazow.net? What you're saying is that the colour is too dark for your terminal?\n. Which terminal/colorscheme are you on?\n. Mmm yes, I see what you mean, thank you.\nIf you'd like to supply a PR that tweaks the colourscheme, that would be appreciated. :) Seems chat.shazow.net is a bit better than chat2.shazow.net, right?\n. Merging this into #160\n. Ah this isn't a problem, I just didn't define the escape codes properly in my test.\n. Same way as anywhere else, you just need to use an editor that will let you inject the necessary bytes into the file. For example:\nbash\n$ printf \"\\033[91mHello \\033[0m world.\\n\" > motd.txt\n. I think it's okay to leave some non-essential commands hidden. :)\nIf you feel strongly about this, feel free to add Help field to it and send a PR.\n. https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L339\nNote that there are going to be a bunch of hidden commands. I want to avoid /help turning into a massive appendix, but rather a quick-start essentials guide.\n. @shurcooL \n\nHow do you determine if a command is essential or not? \n\nBy making a judgement call. :) I feel not knowing about /version and /uptime does not prevent you from enjoying ssh-chat in the default case it's intended for. Software has had hidden commands and features since software has become a thing. That's not to make you feel cheated, but more to allow for advanced usecases without shoving every possible scenario down the throats of beginners. :)\nAs I said before, if you feel super strongly about this then please make a PR to satisfy your use case. The extra commands can be included in a manual page. Or maybe a /help commands which just exhaustively lists all registered commands without the extra info would be a good compromise? Anyways, all up to how strongly you feel about this.\n. @Fastidious I'm going to keep this closed because I don't intend to support this issue personally. As it stands, I'll consider it if someone feels super strongly about it and provides good reasoning why /help should have every command (and a PR would help too).\n. Btw I appreciate your efforts. A lot of random people open issues all the time and it's easier for me to keep track on what's actually being worked on when only open issues are ones that are actively pursued. :)\n. Thanks! This is going to change soon alas, but good to have.\n. I would not be opposed but it would be pretty hard as you'd need to fork the ssh/terminal package we're using and change the formatting mechanics. If you're interested in doing it, I would welcome a PR that does it but I'm going to close this issue for now as it's not on the roadmap for now. :)\n. Cool, I'll check it out in a bit, gotta work on another project this weekend. :)\n. Looks good. Was there anything you were worried about before I merge?\n. Excellent, thank you. :)\n. /motd is already a thing, there are no rooms yet so /topic makes no sense.\n. Make sure it builds. :) I suggest using go integration with your editor, it'll do it automagically.\n. Yes I understand that, but I still want to fix the bug rather than hiding from it. :)\n. Couple of comments, otherwise looks great. Thank you! :)\n. Perfect, thank you! :)\n. I don't understand what you mean? We ignore empty messages, but whitespace messages are not ignored intentionally.\n. Why?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/99, please search for old issues.\n. One nit, otherwise looks good!\n. We really need a theme for light backgrounds though, solar light would be more useful maybe.\n. @sleibrock Omg my internet is the worst right now. How about we just rename the solardark theme to \"solarized\" since you said it works with both light/dark and call it a day for now? :D\n. Hm doesn't look like it was causing the problem I thought it did, closing for now.\n. It's impossible to detect exactly when a user disconnects when it's not user-initiated, also ssh can try to recover the connection for lossy networks. The keep-alive ping will kick your disconnected ghost next time it rolls around, that's the best we can do until user registration is implemented.\n. Might be out of date, would you like to update it?\nAnd yes, you need to get pubkeys out of band to whitelist them. It takes a file in the same format as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n. Thanks!\n. Yea I think I took it out because there was a race condition that is now fixed, wee.\n. Yea, there's a few TODOs in that genre depending how big of a names list we want to handle. Using a trie would be one of them.\n. @sahilgoel1610 Evaluating which library to use is part of this task, make sure to look at various options. After a really quick survey, https://github.com/armon/go-radix looks like a good option.. Also this PR does a lot of the work and has some related feedback: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/pull/221 . Correct. :) The idea is to make it easier to visually match names listed to names in the chat.\n. @sahilgoel1610 Why wouldn't it work? You could colorize them in this function: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/command.go#L176. Basically something like this near here.\n. See the hints in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/207. The user needs to be able to disable BELs.\n. Feel free to re-open or make a new one if you feel like doing it later.. Thank you!\n. Which version of Go are you using? Can you try Go 1.7?\n. Looks like you have Go 1.3 installed, which is several years old. I'm guessing your distribution's package manager does not carry a recent version of Go, so you'll need to install it out of band: https://golang.org/dl/\nAlternatively, use the pre-built ssh-chat release binaries for ARM: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases\n. How did you install it?\n- If you use the binary releases, extract it and run it from the directory of where it's extracted or move the binary somewhere into your $PATH.\n- If you're compiling it, make build or go build ./cmd/ssh-chat will spit out the binary in the project root directory, so you'll need to ./ssh-chat\n- If you're using go get github.com/shazow/ssh-chat, then the binary will be in your $GOPATH/bin. Add it to your $PATH or use the absolute path.\n. Yay welcome to the ssh-party. :P\n. Some notes for myself so I don't forget everything and have to re-figure-everything-out from scratch again next time:\n\nMultiplexing connections in the client struct is not the way to go: The room skips sending messages to itself, so the clients are not kept in-sync that way. It would be better to keep separate clients but perhaps share a UserConfig.\n.. Or maybe it's fine if we do it at the terminal layer.. @rileytg Hi! Good question. I would suggest working on master. It's not certain that the v2 refactor will get merged anytime soon\u2014I'm experimenting with some big changes which might not pan out.\n\nIf you're looking for things to hack on, I suggest checking the Tiny tag which should be just a few lines of changes and a great place to start. For bigger work, Help Wanted is a good one.. @zorchenhimer Neat, would you be interested in doing a PR to swap it out?\n. @zorchenhimer Don't worry about Windows off the bat, would be good to switch regardless and we can figure out if Windows works later. :)\n. Thank you! :)\n. Thanks for the thought but we removed our Dockerfile recipe since we've started shipping pre-compiled binaries. It's trivial to run ssh-chat now with or without docker. :)\n. \ud83d\udc4f \ud83c\udf6e \u2728 \nThank you! :)\n. Some thoughts:\n1. Any reason why it makes sense to move the completion from the Host to the Room?\n2. Should a TrieSet be a separate thing from Set? The rest of our sets don't need this feature. TrieSet could embed the normal Set and wrap additional functionality onto it. (It can also live in the set package though.)\n. 1. Given that the only place Room.CompleteName is used is by the Host, I'd say that this logic belongs in the Host.\n2. I'm happy to review your trie implementation as a standalone thing if that would be interesting for you (let me know what kind of feedback you'd like), but for the purpose of this PR I would prefer to use one of the implementations here: https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures\n. Will do. :). @haikuginger Thanks for playing along before. I still look back at this occasionally. If you don't get around to it, I might use your integration points and swap out the Trie implementation. Thanks for doing most of the work for that. :). That's already a thing, ssh-chat emits a BEL character when you're mentioned so you can configure your terminal to respond accordingly.. Hi Deksar,\nWhen you're ready to start working on a feature, please open an issue for that specific feature to discuss the approach.\nFor auto-executing commands, I'd suggest waiting on #74 instead because registered users will retain their configuration state between sessions (wether you have /quiet or not) so you won't need any auto-executing commands.\n\nHow to set a specific login/nickname so that it can write ONLY to an another defined nickname (via msg?), instead of entire the \"chat channel\"?\n\nYou can /msg othernick hello if that's what you mean. If you want a user that can only write to another user, that's too narrow of a use case and out of scope for this project. I suggest forking for that.\n\nHow to set passwords? After logging in with a nickname, requesting a password.\n\nYou can whitelist users using public keys, passwords are less safe and considered out of scope for this project.\n\nAlso perhaps, someday support for RSA ssh keys generated by using -o?\n\nHmm where is it not supported? Please open a specific bug for this, I'd like to support this fully.. Verbosity of the sshd package is set by the ssh-chat when called in debug verbosity: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/cmd/ssh-chat/cmd.go#L84. I'm confused, can you expand on what's wrong?. How does it fail?. Sounds like a good PR if you're interested. :). Not with that attitude! :>. How are you installing it? Try go get -u github.com/shazow/ssh-chat?\nIf you want to use make, you need to make sure you have the latest version (git pull) and have it in your $GOPATH.\nThe master branch no longer has any mentions of the common package.. More instructions here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-build-ssh-chat\nLet me know if you're still having problems.. What version of Go are you using? Make sure to use a recent version of Go.. What version is \"the latest\"? Type go version. You're using gccgo, which is probably like 5 years old. Please use a recent version of Go from here: https://golang.org/dl/. Go 1.3 is from 2014. Please try it with a recent version of Go from https://golang.org/dl/, that means 1.8 or 1.7.. Try nuking your old GOPATH (since it was created with a really old version of Go) and try again?\nrm -rf /opt/gopkg\ngo get -u github.com/shazow/ssh-chat. Oh also those warnings you got are fine. make or go build ./cmd/ssh-chat should still work.\nThe warnings are about the vendor submodules which are optional.. Uhh which directory did you nuke? Is your $GOPATH directory inside your go installation? That'll break everything, it needs to be outside of it.. If you don't need to work with ssh-chat from source, please use the binary releases: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases/\nOtherwise, you need to setup a working Go environment first, follow these instructions: https://golang.org/doc/code.html. If you don't need to work with ssh-chat from source, please use the binary releases: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases/\nOtherwise, you need to setup a working Go environment first, follow these instructions: https://golang.org/doc/code.html\nssh-chat needs to be inside $GOPATH. $GOPATH cannot be inside of your Go installation or $GOROOT.. You're welcome, have fun. :). You'll probably want to check here if the user is still valid:\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L237\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L319\nAnd if not, reset the ReplyTo to avoid future checks and fail normally.. No clue how to reproduce this, unfortunately.. @rfyiamcool Have you reproduced this bug? Please provide constructive content in comments, use emoji reactions to +1 to things if needed.. Awesome looks good. Now why is travis upset.... Tried it locally, works, yolo.. Which version of Go is this? I can't reproduce locally on Go v1.8.1 no matter how many times I run it.. Specifically fails on Linux. Works on Darwin.. Some quick notes: This is happening because we changed our tests from binding to a hardcoded port to binding to port 0 which is supposed to allocate a random available port that we can use. This should work, no idea why it's not working on Linux. Need to reproduce with a simple example, or fix whatever is making it not work.. LGTM. Wanna figure out why travis is upset?. It's not the same error as #231. This looks like a linting thing.. I appreciate the thought but I'd prefer to avoid including trivial Dockerfiles, especially since this is the same for every Go project and we ship binaries so you don't really need it to run ssh-chat. Feel free to publish on Dockerhub, though!. Hi there, is there an existing issue for this?\nPlease make sure all changes are run through gofmt and such.. Looks good, thank you! I assume you tried it and it works? Our CI is broken right now, unfortunately. \ud83d\ude2d . Excellent, thank you!\nNo worries, it's a pretty change test so as long as it doesn't break any existing tests I'm happy.\nUnfortunately our current state of tests is not great... A bunch of things broke on Linux (still works on Mac), and haven't had a chance to fix them. :( Let me know if you're interested in helping with that! :). \ud83d\udc4f \\<standing ovation> \ud83d\udc4f \nThank you @ograff \u2764\ufe0f \u2728 \ud83c\udf6e . Excellent, thank you! :). Nice, love it! I'm happy to make it more strict.\nWant to do that, and also make the minor changes in the codebase to make it pass? :D. @shurcooL Wow thanks for all your effort writing up the situation.\nLet's just move forward with plain go fmt without the -s since it seems Everything Works with it for now and I'll investigate ignoring vendor later.. Excellent, huge thanks @shurcooL! :custard:. @za267 That's cool that you made a feature for your server. :)\nOne thing to keep in mind is that history message replay will break the time.Now() (historic messages will appear to have been sent when they're rendered).\nThis isn't how I would implement this feature for our version of ssh-chat, but I hope it's working for you! If you're interested in implementing a feature to be merged, pleased open an issue to discuss design/requirements first.. If you want a super quick-and-dirty way to add timestamps, you could prepend the current timestamp right before it gets sent to the user's screen in this function: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/user.go#L168. Messages already have a timestamp you can use, no need to make your own: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/message.go#L14. Which code? From the PR? You're definitely welcome to use it for your server but I'd want a different approach to merge it in here. :). Ah, you'll need to update the prompt every minute or somesuch: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L175. This PR doesn't pass our linting requirements: https://travis-ci.org/shazow/ssh-chat/jobs/268981527\nMake sure your editor runs the code through gofmt etc.. Thanks for helping out, btw. :). Thank you!. To recap some feedback: This is largely considered out of scope for this repo of ssh-chat, but if it's implemented in a nice unobtrusive way then we may consider it for merging. :)\n\nEasiest way to do it quick & hacky (will not be merged, but fine for your own fork): Prepend time.Now() to each line that gets sent to the user's screen: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/50001bf1727c8ec7fcfc3ae78ab66a125016d13e/chat/message/user.go#L170\nA more comprehensive way to do it (not likely to be merged, but open for debate): Use message.Message.Timestamp() as a timestamp for each message, and render it as part of a theme. Would need to add a theme.ColorTimestamp(...) function to properly colorize the message segment. Then we could add a theme option whether to render timestamps at all, this would be configured per-user. If disabled, then theme.ColorTimestamp(...) would simply return an empty string. Optional: Also change the user Prompt every minute to keep self-sent messages timestamped. Would need to rewrite where the prompt is set which might be a fair bit of work.\nA more ergonomic approach that is fairly likely to be merged: Anytime a message is sent after some amount of inactivity (e.g. 30min or 1hr), emit the current timestamp as a system message just before relaying the message. This can be done in a very unobtrusive way, and give people a general idea of when messages were sent without polluting the chat too much. It would be configured server-side.. @MaddSauer Please provide constructive content in comments. You can use emoji reactions to +1 things if there's nothing to add to the conversation.. @Atheatos Cool! Unfortunate that just doing SetPrompt is not sufficient.. Ah that is handy to know indeed!. Duplicate of #74. Indeed, it's not possible to run both OpenSSH and ssh-chat on the same port right now.. I believe dep will generate the Gopkg.tml based on the current stuff. But yea, that's the idea.\n\nI don't think much needs to change in the Makefile, just the dep target. I can make that change.\nWant to do a PR if you confirmed it works?. Thanks @sleibrock <3. /me searches, here are some random projects using go dep:\nhttps://github.com/apex/gh-polls\nhttps://github.com/davecheney/httpstat\nhttps://github.com/heptio/ark. >  By deleting the submodules and vendor folder, will this affect the go get process of cloning the code? Once it gets cloned it won't have access to the libs like rateio so it won't be able to build without having dep installed. Is this the correct way to go about this?\nI don't believe it will affect anything. go get does not require dep. dep is optional. vendor/ dir is only used if it's there. If it's not there, go get does what go get has been doing since it was first created, long before vendor/ was introduced.. Love it. Still good to merge as soon as you're ready (remove WIP).. Indeed, other clients work, not sure why JuiceSSH does not.. @tionis Have you read our FAQ? This question should be relevant: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#can-i-block-users-from-connecting-how-do-i-assign-admins. @tionis That's just how linux/bash works. In order to be able to run a binary from anywhere, it needs to be in your $PATH, such as /usr/bin/. If you want to run a binary that does not live inside a directory that is in your $PATH, then you need to specify the path to the binary.\nLet's say you put ssh-chat in /root/downloads/, then you can run it as\nbash\n$ /root/downloads/ssh-chat --help\nOr\nbash\n/ $  cd /root/downloads\n/root/downloads $  ./ssh-chat --help\nNote the ./ in front, because it still needs to be a path.\nMore on that here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6331075/why-do-you-need-dot-slash-before-script-name-to-run-it-in-bash. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Ha, very cute!\n. Did you run this? Won't it print every message twice?\n. Looks decent. What do you think, @voldyman? :) \n. Thankies!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. HMM interesting, any idea how this looks like on lesser terminals?\nAlso will need to rebase this. Will merge other PRs first.\n. Cute! Thanks! :)\n. Good idea.\n. Good call, thanks!\n. Why? Doesn't ssh use md5 by default, or am I mistaken? I wanna show the same fingerprints you get when you ssh into a host.\n. Well, find out what ssh clients use, if it's sha1 then I'll merge it. :)\n. Let's do this after we complete #19 and migrate in one fell swoop.\nAlso maybe allow for specifying the full pubkey, not just fingerprint.\n. Oops forgot to close this now that the refactor branch is merged. But yea, this is done.\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/sshd/auth.go#L67\n@freewil Maybe we saw the same tweet. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Good call, thanks!\n. Hm, try again? Might have been a bad commit.\n. Btw, what version of Go? We're targeting 1.4 (or 1.3 at least) I think.\n. Yay glad it works!\n. Sick. I love it.\n. In general.\nWhen we use the name as an index in our map[string]..., we should lowercase the key before inserting/comparing.\n. Fast like :zap: \n. In fact, it was a little bit :ghost:\n. Why not put a space in front of it? I'd prefer to stick more true to traditional IRC behavior.\n. I GUESS! I'd like to support reserving names and marking admins in a similar fashion, but we can add it later.\nAlso I'd suggest supporting pubkey signatures, similar to ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Easier to fill them from github profiles and whatnot.\n. pubkeys for future PR is cool. :)\n. Done. It accepts authorized_keys-style files now.\n. @Fastidious Added a section here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#can-i-block-users-from-connecting-how-do-i-assign-admins\nBasically it's one pubkey per line, as you wrote it.\n. TY\n. Good call, thanks!\n. This way we can shove in some classy ascii art into it, like a banner.\n. Neat!\nI kinda like people not being able to control their colors. Let's keep it that way. :)\n. Or how about we just remove black colors from being chosen instead? :)\n. If we'd like to avoid having the same color as somebody else, we could make the colors cycle rather than be random, but I don't think it's worth doing that.\n. Well isn't black near the edge, couldn't you make the number smaller/make an offset? :)\n. Ooo neat chart, thanks.\nRe white terminals, turning off colors will help for now. Later adding more themes will help (dark vs light).\nWonder if there's a golang library that has some of this color stuff figured out... Wanna search? :D\n. Right you are. :) Fixing.\n. You can keep the same PR (branch) if you'd prefer; it can be easier to keep discussion context that way.\nIf you're worried about commit history, I can squash before merging (but I generally don't care).\n. Hey, thanks for this, very cool!\nI'm reluctant in merging a feature like this right now, I think there are a lot of open questions (e.g. how do you handle presence in multiple channels?) and I'm not sure it's a necessary feature just yet (1 server per channel is not too bad).\nBut you're welcome to continue developing this in your fork. I would be interested to hear how you're using this. :)\n. I appreciate the thought, it's a cool idea. :)\nOn Dec 13, 2014 7:18 PM, \"Evgeniy Vasilev\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSure, it was just proof of concept.

You do know how many people are in the room with you,\n...\n * shazow joined. (Total connected: 41)\n-> Welcome to ssh-chat. Enter /help for more.\n. ~~I actually like the idea that it's possible but not trivial to change your color. I rather not allow people spamming color changes (we already have enough problems with people spamming renames).~~\n. Oh this turns off color, not changes it. Interesting.\n. Would probably be better to not color in the first place rather than de-color after the fact (if color is turned off).\n. > So change the default to no color at all?\nSorry, I meant that instead of applying colors to strings and then stripping colors off if people don't want them, we shouldn't be applying colors to strings in the first place if people don't want them.\nUltimately this should also allow us to apply different kinds of colors for people on demand, based on selected themes.\nThat aside, I believe colors should be on by default.\nThis improvement might be better for a separate PR though, what do you think?\n. Mmm yea I think we might need a big refactor to handle coloring on-demand. Let's go forward with this as-is for now, then.\n. Oh btw, wanna add the /theme command to the help text?\n. Thank you! :)\n. Fixed in #54.\n. Not right now, I think.\nWe still haven't chosen our storage mechanism for persisting state. Let's do this piece afterwards. :)\nI opened an issue: #47\n. Hey @JeanSebTr, that looks really nice, thank you!\nI'm actually planning on rewriting that whole section of code myself also. Do you might if I hang onto this PR as a reference? I had a different idea for how to structure the code and I'd like to give it a try. (Unfortunately this will probably have to wait until next week.)\n. This is done within the refactor branch that was merged.\n. Thank you! :)\n. sqlite is my least favorite choice right now as relational schema-enforced is not beneficial for the problem at hand and adds a fair bit of code complexity to setup, maintain, and query.\nI don't believe there is a need for a config file just yet, as long as the command-line flags remain simple enough.\nI can confidently say that we are definitely not touching XML for anything. :)\n. Decoupling makes sense when you have something to decouple, it's still too early to even know what we want to store or what we'll do with it. Further, depends which storage backend we choose will dictate how simple/complex the usage of it is and how we implement the feature.\nYou're welcome to tackle and propose an interface, but I suspect it's going to change a lot before it's put into use. :/\n. Hopefully fixed by #50, will re-open otherwise.\n. Looks like this is still a problem, we've more pprof'ing to do. /cc @empathetic-alligator \n. Hmm might not be a problem actually, garbage collector doing garbage collecty things. Will leave it running for a while longer. Note to self: run with pprof.\n. Should be much better as of v1.2\n. @empathetic-alligator You're a fantastic human being, thank you!\n\nI used pprof to find it, should it be permanently enabled? The only problem is that an http server must be running in the background. Should I add a command line arg that turns it on?\n\nYea I was thinking adding an optional --pprof <port>, what do you think? (Maybe diff PR)\n. Nice! Can you please rebase against the latest master so that I can hit the big red merge button? :D\nThank you again!\n. Wonderful, thank you!\nIf you can find a way to make travisci fail on linting errors, that'd be great. :)\n. Excellent, one nit. :)\n. Also failing our new stricter travisci lint tests: https://travis-ci.org/shazow/ssh-chat/builds/44044384\n. Excellent!\n. I like this solution, thank you. :)\n. Thank you!\n. I think that's a good idea. I want to try to do this next week too, but if you want to try and beat me to it, have at it! :)\n. Not yet.\nJust a warning, I'm going to be going offline until next week and possibly reworking this while I'm away. There's a good chance I'll do this while I'm offline, but you're welcome to try as well if you don't mind the chance of being superseded. :)\n. Done.\n. aquilax claims it's working now, yay! http://i.imgur.com/II14xR5.png\n. @empathetic-alligator Just restarted with the new version an hour ago, so give it a try again.\n@aquilax Any tips?\n. Shippin' it! Thank you.\n. @empathetic-alligator I would adore a better fix. :) This is the only workaround we could think of.\n. Clearly there are a lot of options, need to pick something sensible.\nI like the idea of being notified wherever I'm mentioned, making mentioners have to prefix with @ to know I got notified feels like an unnecessary thing to educate them on. :/\n. Regexp has been vastly improved in the new version.\n. Whitelist implies that nobody except people in the whitelist can join, so that's still fine.\nAs far as banning goes, yes it wouldn't work anymore. I have mixed feelings about implementing ip-based banning as opposed to using something like iptables.\nEither way, I'd like to support no-pubkey connections, at least optionally (might add a flag later). Thank you for this. :)\n. @songgao Oh can you send a PR that rejects no-pubkey connections if whitelist is defined?\n. Maybe something like:\ngo\nif !server.IsWhitelisted(\"\") {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"Not Whitelisted.\")\n}\nIf there is no whitelist, it should do the Right Thing I think.\n. Not yet.\nOn Dec 16, 2014 4:27 PM, \"persontwo\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHas the server been restarted since PR#62 was merged?

Thanks for reporting, that's no fun. :)\n. Done.\n. Thank you! Very important feature. :)\n. Will take a look at this later. FYI, in the future, you don't have to open a new PR just to change stuff.

NP. :) Will take a look at PRs tomorrow, taking a day off ssh-chat otherwise (as you can tell lol).\n. Some good ideas, but what do you think about doing something like #44 instead?\nI plan to do this kind of refactor myself soon, maybe it'd be best to leave it off until then.\n. Thanks @peterhellberg. Sorry for not giving this feedback earlier. :)\n. I've thought about this but I leaned towards not including it. The main reason to include it on-join is to alert the joining user how many people are in the room with him/her. For leaving, there's no point. If someone who is already in the room wants to know, they can always do /list. :)\nThank you though, I appreciate the effort!\n. Crafty, thanks.\n. This will still tab-complete to lowercase names rather than properly-cased names, right? Can we fix that too?\n. Thank you for pinging! :)\nLooks good, can you rebase against master, looks like there are some merge conflicts. I think we added a RWLock around iterating over clients.\n. Perfect, thank you!\n. There is no name \"registration\" yet, that will come as a feature in the future once the plumbing is done. :)\n. @empathetic-alligator Good stuff, thank you. Left some review comments. Happy to merge this after we clean up the code. :)\n. Not a problem, I appreciate you getting involved. :)\n. Please ping me when I should take a look at it again. :)\n. Looks great, thank you! :)\n. /cc @jazzychad Check this out.\n. Saw this in the logs yesterday after the server crashed.\nI don't believe the server was shutting down, except for this crash. There were many hundreds of lines of traceback from various goroutines\u2014we might also be leaking goroutines. :p\n. Should be fixed in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/b90017bfe6f96252e9db96bb972d27f2c7246a66\n. Yup this is planned, thank you for tracking it.\nCurrently blocked on #47 (feel free to join the discussion).\nThis will likely be an optional feature, possibly not enabled on public servers, or maybe users will need to ask for permission from ops to be able to register their nicks.\n. More thoughts on this as I'm starting to spec it out:\nUser registration and out-of-band notifications\nYou'll be able to type /register myemail@domain.com and it will attach your pubkey to your email (after sending off a validation email and confirming ownership through another command). The benefit of registration is you get offline presence (aka you appear as in-chat even if you disconnect) and you get instant email notifications of mentions and emails of conversation summaries of what you missed (hourly/daily maybe). Possibly do push notifications too (through pushbullet or something else).\n. When email notifications get sent, they're going to include a \"safe\" unencrypted section, and the context of the notification will be encrypted below if you want to read it without reconnecting. Something like this:\n\nYou were mentioned on chat.shazow.net.\nConnect to the server to read the notification, or run the command below to decrypt the context:\n$ openssl command to decrypt using your ssh privkey << EOF\n[[encrypted base64 blob to your ssh pubkey]]\nEOF\n. A quick update: There's some progress in the refactor branch towards design changes that are required for this, but I'd say it's still around 50% done. I'm not actively working on this right now so it might be a while.. Done.\n. Merged the giant refactor branch into master, preparing for v1.0 release. \n. Just release v1.1 with binary builds. Still lots of work to do, but tests pass and there are no detected race conditions, it doesn't crash in trivial cases anymore, and we have 46.6% coverage across modules. While not all of the TODOs are completed, I think it's in a good state and good enough to close this issue for now.\n. Sorry I just beat you to it. :)\n\nAlso I don't think we need to check for \"\", because that's a nice easy way to disable no-auth logins (banning \"\" fingerprint).\n. I'll fix that, thanks!\n. Fixed in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/8bba2e391797ad21f1dc4ae3751f6ab9a8744791 among other things.\n. @empathetic-alligator Glad you asked! I have some great news for you. I wrote precisely that piece yesterday, but I don't have the piece you're working on. :)\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-hammer\nFeel free to steal any/all of that code, or contribute back to it. Whatever makes sense.\n. Btw, in case it wasn't clear, please don't use this on the live chat.shazow.net, your IP will get blacklisted by iptables. :)\n. Take a look at https://github.com/peterhellberg/check-ssh-chat, too.\n. Tests are in a much better state now, yay.\n. Thanks!\n.

Thank you, can you post which commit version you were using? Seems your fork is 20 commits behind the upstream, we might have fixed this bug. :)\n. Yes that bug happened on the latest upstream master, or yes the bug might have been fixed?\n. Ah fair enough, I think we might have fixed it then (I pursued several bugs yesterday). Can you sync to latest master and let me know if this happens again? :D\n. Did the server hang for you when you did this? Or did you write this comment in the wrong issue?\n. @vectorijk This issue is about the server hanging, please open a separate issue?\n. Hopefully fixed in master.\n. Wonderful. :)\n. You'll probably need v1.3 or newer, since we're using http timeouts for a recent feature.\n. Excellent! Also it runs far better on the latest versions. :) I ran it on 1.2 for a while and it was leaking memory and such, I think related to one of the std crypto libs we were using.\n. Pinging top contributors, in case you feel like looking around and giving some feedback. :) Open to ideas for the rewrite.\n/cc @empathetic-alligator, @Kealper, @IQAndreas, @jazzychad\n. Just added a bunch of work. Should be almost at feature parity, would love it if people tried it and let me know how it is. Things I need to add:\n- [x] Name sanitizing\n- [x] Uptime/version\nAnything else?\n. YAY IT'S MERGED!\nNot super battle tested yet, but ready for trial by combat.\n. Mmm yea, nicks get unwhitelisted characters stripped, we should do that before announcing.\n. Oops opened #92 as dupe, fixed now tho.\n. Hmm interesting, I wonder if it's related to us not handling the shell channel properly. Thanks for filing! Would appreciate any help looking into this.\n. Please give it a try on v1.1 and re-open if it's still a problem. :)\n. Fixed in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/tree/refactor with aliases. :)\n. OKAAAY. :P\n. Should be good now, lmk if it doesn't work.\n. I'm afraid it's out of scope for this particular project, but feel free to fork and implement your own version (I suggest starting from the refactor branch, which will be v1.0 soon).\nFor now, you can host multiple instances of these and call each one a channel. :)\n. FWIW, I'd avoid mixing IRC-style and Unix-style commands. Stick with IRC, it already has commands for all of this.\n. Aha, thanks for doing it for this branch, you rock. :)\n. Might be fun to add const/iota types to messages for extra annotation/filtering, will think about this...\n. Can you rebase so that I can hit the big green button? :D\n. ty. just refactored that and didn't catch all the type assertions yet. :)\n. Ah thanks for doing this!\nHmm, can you think of other cli tools that solve it this way? Not sure it's a good idea to accept a password through a cli flag as it will show up in the process list and leak the password. Stdin is fine. Environment variable possibly.\n. It would be possible, but we decided not to in this particular project. We feel the experience is more magical without timestamps.\n. Thank you!\n. You're awesome!\n. Done.\n. :custard: thank you\n. What distinguishes a human interface from a bot interface? Are we going to start presenting CAPTCHAs? :)\n. Ah, well there is /theme mono which removes all colors. No plans for JSON yet, though. Maybe someday.\n. There is no way to force bots to identify themselves as such, /mute command will come eventually to let you silence whoever you don't like. We can also add better throttling heuristics if anyone has ideas.\nMost likely implementation of a non-human interface is maybe something like TERM=bot env variable which will skip PTY handling and won't set a prompt.\n. I was thinking of exposing the TERM variable in the /whois (any objections?), so that may help further in identifying people vs bots.\n. @chexo3 This is unrelated to bash, it's your terminal (that you might run bash inside).\nNo, I don't think there should be security implications. But someone correct me if I'm wrong.\n. IMO setting a TERM variable to bot or readline something would be the cleanest thing to do.\n. That's nothing to do with ssh-chat, that's screen. You need to do ctrl+a, ctrl+d to scrawl with pgup/down.\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/scroll-up-down-look-at-data-in-gnuscreen-using-pageup-pagedown-keys/\n. Thanks. :)\n. You're welcome to fork this project and maintain a version of it that has these things, but it's out of scope for the mainline version. :)\n. Your bikeshed is lovely, thank you!\n. One thing that could be improved if you're up for it is to print the host/port based on the socket that actually gets allocated, that way it'll do the Right Thing when you specify port 0 (random available port).\n. Hmm strange, maybe try a fresh $GOPATH? I suggest something like...\n$ export GOPATH=$PWD/pkg\n$ go get github.com/shazow/ssh-chat\n. No, you don't need root unless you run ssh-chat on port 22. You definitely\ndon't need root to just build it.\nOn Jan 4, 2015 10:55 PM, \"devNET software group\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nYes, it needs root.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/110#issuecomment-68674187.\n. Let me know if this is still happening.\n. Would be cool if we had somekind of continuous builds setup, I think there are some services that do this. For now, a Docker image might suffice.\n. @smiller171 I don't think we need docker for this, but you're welcome to help. :) We need a GOARCH/GOOS build matrix and then publish the binaries somewhere (maybe github releases).\n. Thank you! Feel free to submit an in-progress PR for early feedback (just mark it as WIP in the title).\n. Not quite continuous, but I have some scripts to generate packaged binary releases. Good enough for now! https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases\n. :revolving_hearts: \n. We're just piggybacking on golang's crypto/ssh library for these things. Would need to fork it to add that support, or report the bug to them. Sorries.\n\nhttps://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#pkg-constants\n. Fixed.\n. What version of Go? Need v1.3 or newer.\n. Type go version.\n. Maybe try a fresh Go environment? Something like...\n$ export GOPATH=$HOME/Go2\n$ go get github.com/shazow/ssh-chat\n. Sorry I'm out of ideas. :/ Try building Go from source? Or ask somebody on #go-nuts on freenode IRC?\nLet me know if you figure it out.\n. When you go get ..., it builds it from source.\nAnyways, if you get a copy of the repo, you can do:\n$ go get .\n$ go build ./...\n. Make sure you're in the directory of the ssh-chat source code.\n. You'll need to do go get . to get all the dependencies first, then build.\nOn Tue, Jan 13, 2015 at 1:52 PM, chexo3 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nLast login: Tue Jan 13 16:48:36 on ttys000\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~]-04:50 PM > export GOPATH=/Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~]-04:50 PM > go build ./...\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/cmd.go:13:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/cmd.go:14:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/cmd.go:15:2: cannot find package \"github.com/jessevdk/go-flags\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/client.go:9:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOPATH)\nDesktop/ssh-chat/go/src/ssh-chat/client.go:10:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOPATH)\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~]-04:51 PM > cd /Users/isaacbeckett/ssh-chat/go/src\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~/ssh-chat/go/src]-04:51 PM > go build ./...\nssh-chat/cmd.go:13:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/cmd.go:14:2: cannot find package \"github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/alexcesaro/log/golog (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/cmd.go:15:2: cannot find package \"github.com/jessevdk/go-flags\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/github.com/jessevdk/go-flags (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/client.go:9:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh (from $GOPATH)\nssh-chat/client.go:10:2: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/isaacbeckett/Desktop/ssh-chat-master/src/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal (from $GOPATH)\nisaacbeckett@MacIron:[~/ssh-chat/go/src]-04:51 PM >\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/115#issuecomment-69827656.\n. ssh-chat is installed in $GOPATH/bin.\n. You can drop it wherever you want. go get ... installs is in $GOPATH/bin, what you do with it after is up to you. :) Closing this issue.\n. /motd is a thing.\n. More specifically, the message you see when you join is that. :)\n. I appreciate your thought, but that's out of scope for this version of the project. I welcome you to build your own fork with some of these features! :)\n. What do you mean? How is that different from how it works now?\n. Yea, that's no fun.\n\nUnfortunately I'm fairly sure the relevant code is inside this library that we're using: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal\nI'm not sure we can do much about it without forking it, but might be worth forking.\nRegarding limiting connections, that's not an easy problem to solve.\n. @Lana-chan Could be!\nThe latest refactor branch should handle this better. I wrote a little library to handle rate limiting at the net.Conn level: https://godoc.org/github.com/shazow/rateio\n. Fixed in the latest master.\n. Eeeh, yolomerging.\n. @swecide There is socket read rate limiting. I kinda eyeballed the default values right now, but it's likely we'll need to tweak it more. Can you tell me more about your behaviour? Is the message hand-typed, or program-generated?\nThe default is here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/sshd/net.go#L31 (That's 10kb per 2 minutes, with a 3 second grace period in the beginning.)\nRegarding not being able to join again, that shouldn't happen unless you banned yourself somehow. There's no auto-ban yet.\n. @swecide Can you be more specific, like how long are the messages?\nI need to get better benchmarks on how many bytes ssh sends per character. But I figure allowing 150-200 chars/minute is fairly safe?\nIt may vary with encryption/compression types, though. Hmmm.\n. Hmm that shouldn't happen. Are you able to reproduce it?\nI just tried the same messages on my own local server and it didn't kick me. I had to paste it about 30 times before I got kicked.\n. Yea not clue what's going on here. I'll try to add some logging when somebody is kicked, stay tuned (on vacation atm, might be a while).\n. Okay, tracked down the problem. Each character is ~52 bytes when sent separately (ie. keystrokes, vs copypasta). I'll need to add a different Limiter to the RateLimited connection which does counts # reads rather than # bytes (unless it's a really big read). Will fix soon. :)\n. Thank you!\n. This is already a thing. You need to be an admin to /kick or /ban users.\nYou can add initial admins by supplying a file with their public key using the --admin flag. After that, you can /admin people.\n. No worries. :)\n. Appreciate the suggestion!\nI think a better approach to have pre-built binaries people can download. See #111.\n. Yup, I'm familiar with brew. I've been using it for years on my OSX. Unfortunately, it's only relevant to OSX.\nWhy would a .pkg work better?\nGolang can compile binaries for all platforms, not just *nix.\nI'm not going to stop you from making a Brew recipe for ssh-chat, I'm just saying it's not something I'm going to pursue. :)\n. You might be mistaking what a golang-built binary is. The tarball download you're asking for is exactly what it is. I'm not sure what difference you're drawing between a *nix binary and a prebuilt binary and a .pkg native format.\nAlso, you need git for brew to work regardless (albeit brew installs it for you). Anyways, feel free to make whatever recipe you'd like. :)\n. > I mean a nix binary is for nix systems, it is prebuilt as well, but you would need to decompile it and recompile on a mac to use it on a mac\nThat's not how it works. You don't decompile anything. Go builds binaries for target platforms. You can build one for each of Linux, Mac, Windows.\n\nWhat version is ssh-chat at?\n\nWhat do you mean? The latest commit hash is the version right now. Vaguely v1.x.\n. Good find, fixed! \n. Ban user/ip already exists.\nChannels is out of scope for this fork, but you're welcome to add it yourself. :)\n. I appreciate the thought but I don't want to introduce remote code execution to ssh-chat as that would open up a big can of vulnerabilities for us to fight against. :)\n. I forget, it might already be possible to pipe things. It'll likely trigger anti-spam throttling, though.\n. Nevermind, I think we disabled that because people were having too much fun piping in junk.\n. @chexo3 This is not something I need, but you're welcome to do that in your fork. :) You may need to implement a handler for the exec channel request type to do what @aminehmida proposed.\n. @fjarlq As you noticed, this package is a bit stale as it's not actively being worked on at the moment. I appreciate you diving in and cleaning up, very welcome improvements. :)\nThank you again!\n. Thank you!\n. Can we make this only run on the master branch after the PRs have been merged, in a separate suite?\nI still want to keep travisci tests for PRs.\n. > You need to set DOCKER_USER, DOCKER_EMAIL, and DOCKER_PASS environment variables in Travis for it to push the image to Docker Hub\nDoes it make any sense to do this? I don't want to let everyone in the world push to my docker hub account. Or can I do this privately in my travis account?\n. What version of Go are you running? What OS?\n. Yea looks like the tests are hanging, probably a deadlock. Not sure why. We should add a -timeout 10s or something to the go test command. Default is 10min which is a bit cray.\n. If you can identify how you reproduce the failures on a specific platform, please open an issue. :)\n. Removed docker releases in favour of binary releases, can be easily wrapped with any blank docker now.\n. Can't reproduce. Maybe your internet connection is blocking outbound SSH? Could try it from a different network.\n. Oh, if you're connecting but getting permission denied, it's possible your ssh key got banned. You can try a fresh key. :)\n. ssh-chat accepts an optional whitelist of public keys. chat.shazow.net does not operate with a whitelist, so all public keys are accepted unless they're invalid/banned.\n. You too, happy chatting! :)\n. Umm, you could run ssh from bash to ssh into your ssh-chat server. :) Or read the logs.\n. Start it on a different port?\n. ssh-chat is not a client, it's a server. Having users run ssh-chat is not going to do what you want. ssh is a client for ssh-chat (the server). ssh is also a client for sshd (the server).\nNormal sshd and ssh-chat can't share a port right now, you'd need to write a multiplexer of somekind.\n. Thank you!\n. Glad you like it, enjoy! :)\n. @epitron Btw you're from Toronto? I'm moving back to Toronto in a few months, we should grab a beverage.\n. Hey there, the demo server is running v0 (version before a major refactor). You're welcome to try out that branch!\nBetter yet, if you can find what's causing the bug, I'd appreciate a fix. :)\n. I believe there's a --pprof flag which starts ssh-chat with a pprof server that you should be able to inspect after it becomes unresponsive. That output should give us a hint of what's going on, maybe there's a run-away goroutine cluster or a blocked channel somewhere.\n. Glad you like it and thanks for helping out! I'm actually also working on a custom irc server that I hope to combine someday. >.>\n. Btw couple more things, might be worth making a build with the race detector enabled (-race). Also hope you're using Go 1.6, it has some improved stack output that will be easier to parse.\n. No, master should have more features but v0 might be more stable.\n\"won't run\" is just not enough information to help. :) Is there an error, maybe?\n. You're not running it in the pasta?\n. Er sorry, pasta is slang for copy-paste. :)\nYou pasted the commands you typed to build ssh-chat, but you say it won't run and you didn't include anything about running it? Is there an error? With what you're sharing, I just have no information about what is going wrong, all I have is your word telling me it's not working. :)\n. You're welcome. :) Hope you'll have the opportunity to dig into why master is failing for you.\n. --whitelist= flag, see --help\n. Should be fixed in v1.1, give it a try. :)\n. Which version did you try? Latest master has the new format iirc.\n. Well, my \"reference server\" is a bit out of date. :)\n[shazow] /uptime\n-> 11017h53m7.906117303s\n. Indeed it would, but alas keybase does not do anything with ssh pubkeys so it doesn't really fit. :( Related issue: https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/710\nAlso PM me your email address and I'll send you an invite. :)\n. Hmm so it's not bindable from 0.0.0.0:2022 locally? That's frustrating. Honestly not sure what the problem is here, would appreciate any help with debugging. :)\n. Can anyone confirm if this is still a problem with v1.1? Check the latest binary release here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases\nPlease re-open the issue if its.\n. Ah you probably want a more modern Go, 1.3 is several years old. Try to get 1.5 or newer.\n. @jbenet I like the idea but not comfortable rewriting imports to use ipfs for a non-ipfs-related project though. (Not yet at least.) :)\n. @jbenet:\n1. I don't feel the transport should be hardcoded into the import namespace. I think this is consistent with Go's decision to exclude http(s)://, git:// etc from the import statements, and adding ipfs:// or similar (even /ipfs/...) would be a regression in that direction.\n2. I don't want to require an additional non-ubiquitous service that is largely unrelated to golang dev just to build the project. If it was an optional enhancement, that'd be cool.\nReally a pinning/lock file is probably the way to go, where aware tools can fetch the dependencies from the best possible source (yay ipfs if available!) but still fall back to the normal golang vendoring/namespacing mechanics.\n. > gx works out of the box without ipfs, it uses http from the ipfs.io gateway. (think of it as our github.com or our npm), but it verifies all the content is correct, and version locks.\nFair point. My ideal dep tool degrades gracefully to not requiring any external tools but adds value when available.\nThe package mapping thing will put it at a place where it could work, though!\n. Should be fixed with https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/838f58e648b30bbf2ee2b9351fdf92bd1eb6a333\n. Which version of ssh-chat are you using? The latest master?\n. Cool cool. Any interest in helping debug? :) I'm not actively working on ssh-chat right now but I'd be happy to review PRs and point you in the right direction.\n. No worries, thanks for reporting it! I'll take a look at this if I pick up the project again, but can't promise a timeline. Maybe someone will beat me to it! :)\n. Fixed in v1.1, weee.\n. I'm going to be working on fixing some panic/crash bugs in master, and I want to add email notifications. Also binary builds releases.\n. Let's say starting around 1pm EST? Also changed the tentative date to Sat July 9th. I'll likely continue doing some work into June 10th and a bit onwards if people want to keep going remotely. :)\n. @0x004a \n\nWhen typing a line wider than terminal width, it skips a line. (not sure why)\n\nIt's a known issue in the terminal stdlib we're using unfortunately, related info here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/22\n. Hey everyone, hope you're ready to hack on ssh-chat this weekend!\nI'm super busy with moving back to Canadia but I'm making time for this. Looking forward to pushing out some fun features. :)\n. Okay it'shappening.gif, join the main ssh-chat server to participate.\nsh\n$ ssh chat.shazow.net\n. Hey everyone, thanks for those of you who came online to hack with me. :D We got some stuff done:\n- @prologic wrote keepalive code that I'm excited to merge soon (feedback pending), and some other good-spirited submissions.\n- @mcroydon cheered us on from the sidelines.\n- My buddy Ted hung out and learned Go next to me (I helped a bit!)\n- I wrote a script to package up binary releases so that people can stop complaining about having to use Go to run ssh-chat.\nThis date snuck up on me this time around but I'd like to do this again soon. I'm going to keep hacking on stuff on and off until then. Will ping this thread for the next hackathon. :heart:\n. Have you tried setting your GOPATH environment variable? :)\nSome instructions here: https://golang.org/doc/install#testing\nIdeally we'll be providing binaries so you don't need to build it from scratch, but that's not done yet. Sorry.\n. See the link I shared. It's Go's \"workspace\", it's where it will download the dependencies into, build/compile, etc.\n. Mentions with tab-complete are already supported, no @ necessary. :)\n. There is a --whitelist flag which accepts a list of public keys that are allowed to connect. I believe whitelisting can also occur by admins while the server is running with /whitelist but it's ephemeral for now.\n. Fixed.\n. Do you think we could get away with just doing something like this instead?\ngo\n// in sshd/terminal.go:NewTerminal\n...\ngo func() {\n    for range time.Tick(keepaliveInterval) {\n        _, err := channel.SendRequest(\"keepalive\", true, nil)\n        if err != nil {\n            // We'll get an err when the channel is closed, so this goroutine\n            // will clean up itself. Bonus points for catching a specific err.\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}()\nMight be a bit nicer since we avoid introducing more parameters/state to unrelated functions.\n. When the client disconnects. If the goroutine returns, it will get cleaned\nup.\nOn Jul 10, 2016 1:02 PM, \"James Mills\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMaybe :) Are we worried at all about cleaning up the goroutines on client\ndisconnect or server termination?

Merged the proposed variant in 8b9ebbdb6b27f0a00880bd72446e9cac08a4091e, thank you. :)\n. Any concrete benefits here or just your preference?\n\nAs it is, the godoc that gets generated is fairly small and easy to follow, I would prefer to avoid hiding core/required components (auth, host) into more subpackages until things get too messy (sshchat is practically unusable without them).\nSet is probably the only one that is obvious but I didn't feel making a util package was justified for just this one struct, since it's not very big and it's not being reused by any other subpackages.\nRegarding the logger, note how every subpackage has a copy of that. It wouldn't make sense to subpackage just for the sshchat package.\n. That's pretty standard for Go, the idea is you should be able to import the \"primary\" functionality of a package by importing the root repo, as in:\ngo\nimport \"github.com/shazow/ssh-chat\"\nAgain I super-appreciate this initiative. I'm going to close this for now but let's keep it in mind if things get messier. :)\n. Just realized I already did this in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/commit/838f58e648b30bbf2ee2b9351fdf92bd1eb6a333 and forgot to close the issue, oops!\n. (I decided to skip adding Godep to avoid dependency on a specific third-party tool, the submodule pins should be sufficient for now.)\n. @anarcat ssh-chat is all about reinventing wheels, but I'm very aware of the IRC protocol (I've even implemented my own IRC server but haven't gotten around to v3 extensions yet). Thanks. :)\n. Looks great! How do you feel about using a Set rather than a list of ignored users? (Might need to move it into a shared package.)\nThen we can get rid of IgnoredNames(). Maybe even make it a public attribute on User and avoid having Ignore(...) and Unignore(...) altogether since it's all boilerplate anyways?\n. Yay thank you, that's great. I wish we could get travisci to work again, sighhh.\n. This was done a while ago, I think. (cc @sleibrock). Would you be up for writing a test, too? :)\n. Btw, I fixed travisci on the master branch, so should get proper badges if you rebase. :)\n. Going to do a new release so I made the change myself, hope you don't mind. :) Your changes still got merged, thank you!\n. @aaronwinter Excellent, thank you. Also lots more minor issues cropped off if you're feeling inspired. :)\n. There are themes, try /theme mono. I'm open to adding more themes like light, want to contribute one?\n. Basically https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/theme.go#L176-L186\nCould use a couple more themes, one for solarized, one for light backgrounds.\n. Yea basically we'd need a solarized/light background palette, the rest should be the similar. Btw this little block is handy for debugging: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/theme.go#L189-L192\n. Also the default colourscheme is not readable on iTerm2 using the solarized-dark theme. I think just the system messages, would be good to tweak it a bit (see #178).\n. We now have a hacker and solarized colorscheme, thanks to @sleibrock <3\n. It's a known bug, not sure what we can do about it right now:\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/22\n. Also on-join, chat history messages get injected before the motd.\n. Autocomplete is disabled on the chat2 server until this is fixed.\n. This can be reproduced with Autocomplete enabled by running a server, joining with at least one user, then running cat /dev/urandom | ssh ... a few times.\n. Thank you!\n. Hm fair point, thanks!\n. Also BEL emitting for mentions, bonus points for optional enable/disable.\n. Would be nice to include a few extra things while we're at it, like time since joined and client used (v0 had this).\n. Yea I think that's fine, or make it an incremental improvement later.\n. @C0FFEEC0FFEE Thanks! Is there any way to turn on verbose logging?\n. Weird, thanks for reporting it! Will look into it once the more urgent bugs are fixed, or you're welcome to dive in too. :)\n. @botto I think it might have to do with my aggressive rate limiting and the size of your key. I'll tweak that.\n. @botto @C0FFEEC0FFEE Could you both try this server and let me know if it's better? Port 2222 on chat2.shazow.net:\n$ ssh -p 2222 chat2.shazow.net\n. @botto Can you confirm also?\nOtherwise I'm closing this issue, should be resolved with the next release.\n. That's quite a few bits. :P\nCould you try with a shorter key for funsies?\n. Hmmm might be the iptables configuration I was using. Can you try now?\nAlso could you try running a local release and see if you still have problems?\n. FWIW I had iptables set to disconnect after 10 quick successive tcp flushes, bumped that up to 20.\n. /quiet should do it.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/pull/157, but thank you. :)\n. It does have /names, consider /list a secret alias. :)\n. This will be done in #74.\n. All the normal bash terminal shortcuts should work. HOME key and ctrl+a jump to the beginning of the line, just like bash.\n. Is this a problem on chat2.shazow.net? What you're saying is that the colour is too dark for your terminal?\n. Which terminal/colorscheme are you on?\n. Mmm yes, I see what you mean, thank you.\nIf you'd like to supply a PR that tweaks the colourscheme, that would be appreciated. :) Seems chat.shazow.net is a bit better than chat2.shazow.net, right?\n. Merging this into #160\n. Ah this isn't a problem, I just didn't define the escape codes properly in my test.\n. Same way as anywhere else, you just need to use an editor that will let you inject the necessary bytes into the file. For example:\nbash\n$ printf \"\\033[91mHello \\033[0m world.\\n\" > motd.txt\n. I think it's okay to leave some non-essential commands hidden. :)\nIf you feel strongly about this, feel free to add Help field to it and send a PR.\n. https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L339\nNote that there are going to be a bunch of hidden commands. I want to avoid /help turning into a massive appendix, but rather a quick-start essentials guide.\n. @shurcooL \n\nHow do you determine if a command is essential or not? \n\nBy making a judgement call. :) I feel not knowing about /version and /uptime does not prevent you from enjoying ssh-chat in the default case it's intended for. Software has had hidden commands and features since software has become a thing. That's not to make you feel cheated, but more to allow for advanced usecases without shoving every possible scenario down the throats of beginners. :)\nAs I said before, if you feel super strongly about this then please make a PR to satisfy your use case. The extra commands can be included in a manual page. Or maybe a /help commands which just exhaustively lists all registered commands without the extra info would be a good compromise? Anyways, all up to how strongly you feel about this.\n. @Fastidious I'm going to keep this closed because I don't intend to support this issue personally. As it stands, I'll consider it if someone feels super strongly about it and provides good reasoning why /help should have every command (and a PR would help too).\n. Btw I appreciate your efforts. A lot of random people open issues all the time and it's easier for me to keep track on what's actually being worked on when only open issues are ones that are actively pursued. :)\n. Thanks! This is going to change soon alas, but good to have.\n. I would not be opposed but it would be pretty hard as you'd need to fork the ssh/terminal package we're using and change the formatting mechanics. If you're interested in doing it, I would welcome a PR that does it but I'm going to close this issue for now as it's not on the roadmap for now. :)\n. Cool, I'll check it out in a bit, gotta work on another project this weekend. :)\n. Looks good. Was there anything you were worried about before I merge?\n. Excellent, thank you. :)\n. /motd is already a thing, there are no rooms yet so /topic makes no sense.\n. Make sure it builds. :) I suggest using go integration with your editor, it'll do it automagically.\n. Yes I understand that, but I still want to fix the bug rather than hiding from it. :)\n. Couple of comments, otherwise looks great. Thank you! :)\n. Perfect, thank you! :)\n. I don't understand what you mean? We ignore empty messages, but whitespace messages are not ignored intentionally.\n. Why?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/99, please search for old issues.\n. One nit, otherwise looks good!\n. We really need a theme for light backgrounds though, solar light would be more useful maybe.\n. @sleibrock Omg my internet is the worst right now. How about we just rename the solardark theme to \"solarized\" since you said it works with both light/dark and call it a day for now? :D\n. Hm doesn't look like it was causing the problem I thought it did, closing for now.\n. It's impossible to detect exactly when a user disconnects when it's not user-initiated, also ssh can try to recover the connection for lossy networks. The keep-alive ping will kick your disconnected ghost next time it rolls around, that's the best we can do until user registration is implemented.\n. Might be out of date, would you like to update it?\nAnd yes, you need to get pubkeys out of band to whitelist them. It takes a file in the same format as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n. Thanks!\n. Yea I think I took it out because there was a race condition that is now fixed, wee.\n. Yea, there's a few TODOs in that genre depending how big of a names list we want to handle. Using a trie would be one of them.\n. @sahilgoel1610 Evaluating which library to use is part of this task, make sure to look at various options. After a really quick survey, https://github.com/armon/go-radix looks like a good option.. Also this PR does a lot of the work and has some related feedback: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/pull/221 . Correct. :) The idea is to make it easier to visually match names listed to names in the chat.\n. @sahilgoel1610 Why wouldn't it work? You could colorize them in this function: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/command.go#L176. Basically something like this near here.\n. See the hints in https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues/207. The user needs to be able to disable BELs.\n. Feel free to re-open or make a new one if you feel like doing it later.. Thank you!\n. Which version of Go are you using? Can you try Go 1.7?\n. Looks like you have Go 1.3 installed, which is several years old. I'm guessing your distribution's package manager does not carry a recent version of Go, so you'll need to install it out of band: https://golang.org/dl/\nAlternatively, use the pre-built ssh-chat release binaries for ARM: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases\n. How did you install it?\n- If you use the binary releases, extract it and run it from the directory of where it's extracted or move the binary somewhere into your $PATH.\n- If you're compiling it, make build or go build ./cmd/ssh-chat will spit out the binary in the project root directory, so you'll need to ./ssh-chat\n- If you're using go get github.com/shazow/ssh-chat, then the binary will be in your $GOPATH/bin. Add it to your $PATH or use the absolute path.\n. Yay welcome to the ssh-party. :P\n. Some notes for myself so I don't forget everything and have to re-figure-everything-out from scratch again next time:\n\nMultiplexing connections in the client struct is not the way to go: The room skips sending messages to itself, so the clients are not kept in-sync that way. It would be better to keep separate clients but perhaps share a UserConfig.\n.. Or maybe it's fine if we do it at the terminal layer.. @rileytg Hi! Good question. I would suggest working on master. It's not certain that the v2 refactor will get merged anytime soon\u2014I'm experimenting with some big changes which might not pan out.\n\nIf you're looking for things to hack on, I suggest checking the Tiny tag which should be just a few lines of changes and a great place to start. For bigger work, Help Wanted is a good one.. @zorchenhimer Neat, would you be interested in doing a PR to swap it out?\n. @zorchenhimer Don't worry about Windows off the bat, would be good to switch regardless and we can figure out if Windows works later. :)\n. Thank you! :)\n. Thanks for the thought but we removed our Dockerfile recipe since we've started shipping pre-compiled binaries. It's trivial to run ssh-chat now with or without docker. :)\n. \ud83d\udc4f \ud83c\udf6e \u2728 \nThank you! :)\n. Some thoughts:\n1. Any reason why it makes sense to move the completion from the Host to the Room?\n2. Should a TrieSet be a separate thing from Set? The rest of our sets don't need this feature. TrieSet could embed the normal Set and wrap additional functionality onto it. (It can also live in the set package though.)\n. 1. Given that the only place Room.CompleteName is used is by the Host, I'd say that this logic belongs in the Host.\n2. I'm happy to review your trie implementation as a standalone thing if that would be interesting for you (let me know what kind of feedback you'd like), but for the purpose of this PR I would prefer to use one of the implementations here: https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures\n. Will do. :). @haikuginger Thanks for playing along before. I still look back at this occasionally. If you don't get around to it, I might use your integration points and swap out the Trie implementation. Thanks for doing most of the work for that. :). That's already a thing, ssh-chat emits a BEL character when you're mentioned so you can configure your terminal to respond accordingly.. Hi Deksar,\nWhen you're ready to start working on a feature, please open an issue for that specific feature to discuss the approach.\nFor auto-executing commands, I'd suggest waiting on #74 instead because registered users will retain their configuration state between sessions (wether you have /quiet or not) so you won't need any auto-executing commands.\n\nHow to set a specific login/nickname so that it can write ONLY to an another defined nickname (via msg?), instead of entire the \"chat channel\"?\n\nYou can /msg othernick hello if that's what you mean. If you want a user that can only write to another user, that's too narrow of a use case and out of scope for this project. I suggest forking for that.\n\nHow to set passwords? After logging in with a nickname, requesting a password.\n\nYou can whitelist users using public keys, passwords are less safe and considered out of scope for this project.\n\nAlso perhaps, someday support for RSA ssh keys generated by using -o?\n\nHmm where is it not supported? Please open a specific bug for this, I'd like to support this fully.. Verbosity of the sshd package is set by the ssh-chat when called in debug verbosity: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/cmd/ssh-chat/cmd.go#L84. I'm confused, can you expand on what's wrong?. How does it fail?. Sounds like a good PR if you're interested. :). Not with that attitude! :>. How are you installing it? Try go get -u github.com/shazow/ssh-chat?\nIf you want to use make, you need to make sure you have the latest version (git pull) and have it in your $GOPATH.\nThe master branch no longer has any mentions of the common package.. More instructions here: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-build-ssh-chat\nLet me know if you're still having problems.. What version of Go are you using? Make sure to use a recent version of Go.. What version is \"the latest\"? Type go version. You're using gccgo, which is probably like 5 years old. Please use a recent version of Go from here: https://golang.org/dl/. Go 1.3 is from 2014. Please try it with a recent version of Go from https://golang.org/dl/, that means 1.8 or 1.7.. Try nuking your old GOPATH (since it was created with a really old version of Go) and try again?\nrm -rf /opt/gopkg\ngo get -u github.com/shazow/ssh-chat. Oh also those warnings you got are fine. make or go build ./cmd/ssh-chat should still work.\nThe warnings are about the vendor submodules which are optional.. Uhh which directory did you nuke? Is your $GOPATH directory inside your go installation? That'll break everything, it needs to be outside of it.. If you don't need to work with ssh-chat from source, please use the binary releases: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases/\nOtherwise, you need to setup a working Go environment first, follow these instructions: https://golang.org/doc/code.html. If you don't need to work with ssh-chat from source, please use the binary releases: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/releases/\nOtherwise, you need to setup a working Go environment first, follow these instructions: https://golang.org/doc/code.html\nssh-chat needs to be inside $GOPATH. $GOPATH cannot be inside of your Go installation or $GOROOT.. You're welcome, have fun. :). You'll probably want to check here if the user is still valid:\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L237\nhttps://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L319\nAnd if not, reset the ReplyTo to avoid future checks and fail normally.. No clue how to reproduce this, unfortunately.. @rfyiamcool Have you reproduced this bug? Please provide constructive content in comments, use emoji reactions to +1 to things if needed.. Awesome looks good. Now why is travis upset.... Tried it locally, works, yolo.. Which version of Go is this? I can't reproduce locally on Go v1.8.1 no matter how many times I run it.. Specifically fails on Linux. Works on Darwin.. Some quick notes: This is happening because we changed our tests from binding to a hardcoded port to binding to port 0 which is supposed to allocate a random available port that we can use. This should work, no idea why it's not working on Linux. Need to reproduce with a simple example, or fix whatever is making it not work.. LGTM. Wanna figure out why travis is upset?. It's not the same error as #231. This looks like a linting thing.. I appreciate the thought but I'd prefer to avoid including trivial Dockerfiles, especially since this is the same for every Go project and we ship binaries so you don't really need it to run ssh-chat. Feel free to publish on Dockerhub, though!. Hi there, is there an existing issue for this?\nPlease make sure all changes are run through gofmt and such.. Looks good, thank you! I assume you tried it and it works? Our CI is broken right now, unfortunately. \ud83d\ude2d . Excellent, thank you!\nNo worries, it's a pretty change test so as long as it doesn't break any existing tests I'm happy.\nUnfortunately our current state of tests is not great... A bunch of things broke on Linux (still works on Mac), and haven't had a chance to fix them. :( Let me know if you're interested in helping with that! :). \ud83d\udc4f \\<standing ovation> \ud83d\udc4f \nThank you @ograff \u2764\ufe0f \u2728 \ud83c\udf6e . Excellent, thank you! :). Nice, love it! I'm happy to make it more strict.\nWant to do that, and also make the minor changes in the codebase to make it pass? :D. @shurcooL Wow thanks for all your effort writing up the situation.\nLet's just move forward with plain go fmt without the -s since it seems Everything Works with it for now and I'll investigate ignoring vendor later.. Excellent, huge thanks @shurcooL! :custard:. @za267 That's cool that you made a feature for your server. :)\nOne thing to keep in mind is that history message replay will break the time.Now() (historic messages will appear to have been sent when they're rendered).\nThis isn't how I would implement this feature for our version of ssh-chat, but I hope it's working for you! If you're interested in implementing a feature to be merged, pleased open an issue to discuss design/requirements first.. If you want a super quick-and-dirty way to add timestamps, you could prepend the current timestamp right before it gets sent to the user's screen in this function: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/user.go#L168. Messages already have a timestamp you can use, no need to make your own: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/chat/message/message.go#L14. Which code? From the PR? You're definitely welcome to use it for your server but I'd want a different approach to merge it in here. :). Ah, you'll need to update the prompt every minute or somesuch: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/master/host.go#L175. This PR doesn't pass our linting requirements: https://travis-ci.org/shazow/ssh-chat/jobs/268981527\nMake sure your editor runs the code through gofmt etc.. Thanks for helping out, btw. :). Thank you!. To recap some feedback: This is largely considered out of scope for this repo of ssh-chat, but if it's implemented in a nice unobtrusive way then we may consider it for merging. :)\n\nEasiest way to do it quick & hacky (will not be merged, but fine for your own fork): Prepend time.Now() to each line that gets sent to the user's screen: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/50001bf1727c8ec7fcfc3ae78ab66a125016d13e/chat/message/user.go#L170\nA more comprehensive way to do it (not likely to be merged, but open for debate): Use message.Message.Timestamp() as a timestamp for each message, and render it as part of a theme. Would need to add a theme.ColorTimestamp(...) function to properly colorize the message segment. Then we could add a theme option whether to render timestamps at all, this would be configured per-user. If disabled, then theme.ColorTimestamp(...) would simply return an empty string. Optional: Also change the user Prompt every minute to keep self-sent messages timestamped. Would need to rewrite where the prompt is set which might be a fair bit of work.\nA more ergonomic approach that is fairly likely to be merged: Anytime a message is sent after some amount of inactivity (e.g. 30min or 1hr), emit the current timestamp as a system message just before relaying the message. This can be done in a very unobtrusive way, and give people a general idea of when messages were sent without polluting the chat too much. It would be configured server-side.. @MaddSauer Please provide constructive content in comments. You can use emoji reactions to +1 things if there's nothing to add to the conversation.. @Atheatos Cool! Unfortunate that just doing SetPrompt is not sufficient.. Ah that is handy to know indeed!. Duplicate of #74. Indeed, it's not possible to run both OpenSSH and ssh-chat on the same port right now.. I believe dep will generate the Gopkg.tml based on the current stuff. But yea, that's the idea.\n\nI don't think much needs to change in the Makefile, just the dep target. I can make that change.\nWant to do a PR if you confirmed it works?. Thanks @sleibrock <3. /me searches, here are some random projects using go dep:\nhttps://github.com/apex/gh-polls\nhttps://github.com/davecheney/httpstat\nhttps://github.com/heptio/ark. >  By deleting the submodules and vendor folder, will this affect the go get process of cloning the code? Once it gets cloned it won't have access to the libs like rateio so it won't be able to build without having dep installed. Is this the correct way to go about this?\nI don't believe it will affect anything. go get does not require dep. dep is optional. vendor/ dir is only used if it's there. If it's not there, go get does what go get has been doing since it was first created, long before vendor/ was introduced.. Love it. Still good to merge as soon as you're ready (remove WIP).. Indeed, other clients work, not sure why JuiceSSH does not.. @tionis Have you read our FAQ? This question should be relevant: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#can-i-block-users-from-connecting-how-do-i-assign-admins. @tionis That's just how linux/bash works. In order to be able to run a binary from anywhere, it needs to be in your $PATH, such as /usr/bin/. If you want to run a binary that does not live inside a directory that is in your $PATH, then you need to specify the path to the binary.\nLet's say you put ssh-chat in /root/downloads/, then you can run it as\nbash\n$ /root/downloads/ssh-chat --help\nOr\nbash\n/ $  cd /root/downloads\n/root/downloads $  ./ssh-chat --help\nNote the ./ in front, because it still needs to be a path.\nMore on that here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6331075/why-do-you-need-dot-slash-before-script-name-to-run-it-in-bash.

Well, those I have seen are nix binaries, a .pkg or .mpkg would work better. Plus brew makes it easy to manage the versions of ssh-chat you have installed. No more complicated removal processes before using your new .pkg. That also makes it easier to integrate as a dependency for other brews, and to make add-ons that can be installed with brew. It is sometimes easier to do things the old fashioned way as well.\n. Ok, well a .pkg is better because it does not require xcode. I needed git to go get ssh chat, and that required xcode one way or another, although brew install git made it easy. a .pkg would not require xcode because it is already built. then rookie users like me (especially those with old macs and that have to sign up for a developer id to get access to old xocde versions, also me) can install with ease. And homebrew makes this easy. Now, if I didn't have go installed, brew install ssh-chat would have installed go as a dependency. This streamlines everything, and if I make an addon for ssh-chat, I can manage that easily.\n. I'd make a brew formula, but first I need a tarball download.\nOr a zip.\n. Oh, and with .pkg you are using a native file format, no unzipping and decompiling and other porting shenanigans. But at that point using a nix binary defeats the purpose of a prebuilt binary.\n. I mean a nix binary is for nix systems, it is prebuilt as well, but you would need to decompile it and recompile on a mac to use it on a mac\n. I basically need a .tgz source.\nYou know what. I know almost nothing about brewing formulae. I'm gonna experiment now and come back to you later.\n. What version is ssh-chat at?\n. Well, then can you re-enable it? At least, with some sort if anti-spam, like a maximum amount of memory per time period.\n. I think that is fine. It's your fault if you use an insecure version of bash anyways.\n. I am using 1.4 I believe. Checks Desktop installer .pkg yep. To be specific I used a version of go installed with this installer filename 'go1.4.darwin-386-osx10.6.pkg' I believe that was the correct version for my system.

Are you okay with github.com/dustin/go-humanize dependency for printing a human readable version of \"time since joined\"?\n. > I think it's okay to leave some non-essential commands hidden. :)\nHow do you determine if a command is essential or not? Doesn't it depend on the user and the context? If the user wants to find out the version of the chat, then /version is essential. If they want to rename themselves, then /nick is essential. If they don't want to change their nick, then /nick is useless to them.\nFrom a UX perspective, as a user, I feel cheated when there's what appears to be an exhaustive list of commands, but in reality it turns out that it was an incomplete list.\nIt encourages guessing and feeling unconfident. A real example of what I ran into was that I wanted to find out the version, and when I saw that /help didn't list /version, I figured it must be impossible. Then I tried /version just in case, and was frustrated to find out that /help lied to me. So next time I see a list of commands, I won't have the confidence in knowing if there's other unlisted commands or not, which leads to a poorer user experience.\nI'd be happier if there was a sentence at the end saying \"There are additional hidden commands, see full list in source.\" or \"Additional minor commands are hidden.\", if you don't want to actually list all commands.\nJust wanted to share some feedback. :) ssh-chat is awesome!\n. > Software has had hidden commands and features since software has become a thing.\nTrue. But that's not proof that it's a good practice, just that it's an existing practice. I want software to become better. :)\n\nThat's not to make you feel cheated, but more to allow for advanced usecases without shoving every possible scenario down the throats of beginners. \n\nThat makes sense. I just prefer it to be done in a friendly way.\n\nAnyways, all up to how strongly you feel about this.\n\nWe shall find out. For now, I just wanted to share constructive feedback.\n. I think this is useful. But why did you call it \"Attempted confirmation\"?\n.

The reason CI fails is because some of the vendored dependencies are not compatible with gofmt -s (luckily, they are compatible with plain gofmt).\nI've discussed the options for a resolution with @shazow, which are:\n\nSee if a newer version already fixes it, update to it if so.\nOtherwise, try to send a PR upstream to fix it myself, and if/once it's merged, update the vendored copy.\nFind a way to ignore /vendor/ from gofmt -s check.\n\nHe told me he prefers option 3, and it's consistent with some of the CI checks already skipping /vendor/.\nI've never had to skip /vendor/ from gofmt checks in my experience, because I use a different solution to vendoring.

But, I don't have a budget to work on that for this PR, so that leaves me with these 2 options:\n\nAvoid -s flag and use plain gofmt.

SGTM, I'll do that.. Updated, tests are passing, PTAL.. But then how will we know which parts of the world all the users are from? Hehe, just kidding.\n. Are you okay with github.com/dustin/go-humanize dependency for printing a human readable version of \"time since joined\"?\n. > I think it's okay to leave some non-essential commands hidden. :)\nHow do you determine if a command is essential or not? Doesn't it depend on the user and the context? If the user wants to find out the version of the chat, then /version is essential. If they want to rename themselves, then /nick is essential. If they don't want to change their nick, then /nick is useless to them.\nFrom a UX perspective, as a user, I feel cheated when there's what appears to be an exhaustive list of commands, but in reality it turns out that it was an incomplete list.\nIt encourages guessing and feeling unconfident. A real example of what I ran into was that I wanted to find out the version, and when I saw that /help didn't list /version, I figured it must be impossible. Then I tried /version just in case, and was frustrated to find out that /help lied to me. So next time I see a list of commands, I won't have the confidence in knowing if there's other unlisted commands or not, which leads to a poorer user experience.\nI'd be happier if there was a sentence at the end saying \"There are additional hidden commands, see full list in source.\" or \"Additional minor commands are hidden.\", if you don't want to actually list all commands.\nJust wanted to share some feedback. :) ssh-chat is awesome!\n. > Software has had hidden commands and features since software has become a thing.\nTrue. But that's not proof that it's a good practice, just that it's an existing practice. I want software to become better. :)\n\nThat's not to make you feel cheated, but more to allow for advanced usecases without shoving every possible scenario down the throats of beginners. \n\nThat makes sense. I just prefer it to be done in a friendly way.\n\nAnyways, all up to how strongly you feel about this.\n\nWe shall find out. For now, I just wanted to share constructive feedback.\n. I think this is useful. But why did you call it \"Attempted confirmation\"?\n. PTAL.\nSorry, I force pushed because I needed to fix the submodule stuff (and github UI doesn't let you easily see diffs between PR revisions, unlike Gerrit).\n. > Nice, love it!

Also, the test previously worked in 0.01 seconds.\n\n\nNot sure what caused the test to start failing.. I did it with Go 1.8, but I believe it's still a problem in 1.6 and 1.7, as per the Travis build.\nSee the Travis build here. I filed an issue for that in #231.\nEdit: im dumb. The linter says Line 125 on host.go, but I think the problem carried over from the batch of commits you added on the refactor branch. Here's the diff from doing git diff master..theme-stuff -- host.go\n```diff\n-       if h.isOp(term.Conn) {\n-               h.Room.Ops.Add(set.Itemize(member.ID(), member))\n+       if key := term.Conn.PublicKey(); key != nil {\n+               authItem, err := h.auth.ops.Get(newAuthKey(key))\n+               if err == nil {\n+                       err = h.Room.Ops.Add(set.Rename(authItem, member.ID()))\n+               }\n+       }\n+       if err != nil {\n+               logger.Warningf(\"[%s] Failed to op: %s\", term.Conn.RemoteAddr(), err)\n        }\n-       ratelimit := rateio.NewSimpleLimiter(3, time.Second*3)\n\nratelimit := rateio.NewSimpleLimiter(3, time.Second*3)\n        logger.Debugf(\"[%s] Joined: %s\", term.Conn.RemoteAddr(), user.Name())\n```\n\nIt claims that err = h.Room.Ops.Add(set.Rename(authItem, member.ID())) is an ineffective assign. But I'm not entirely certain as to why.\nEdit: changing target branch to master as per previous discussion to develop features from master.. Updated to use a single byte buffer instead of sending two separate messages. I used three spaces to keep it properly indented with the system message arrow. I didn't do the inner check skip just because I thought it would further complicate it a bit.. Closed, will come back to this idea at a later time.. Related to #231. sshd and ssh-chat should be running on separate ports. ssh-chat's default port is 2022 and it can be changed when launching ssh-chat with the --bind option (eg. --bind 0.0.0.0:2022).\nYou might want to check netstat --listen to see which programs are listening on which ports.. In order to port ssh-chat to using go dep, the solution would require crafting a Gopkg.toml file with the packages, changing the Makefile to account for downloading packages through dep, and removing any submodules from the Git tracker to avoid extra cloning.\ndep puts all dependencies into the local vendor/ folder, making the Git submodule clones (the ones stored under $GOPATH/github.com) unnecessary.\nI tested this by running dep init, deleting the vendor/ folder in the project, deleting all the extra folders under $GOPATH/github.com and seeing if the build failed, which it did. Then I ran dep ensure to clone the dependencies to vendor/ and ran the build again, which ran successfully.\nI prefer the dependencies to be listed in a file like with Gopkg.toml because it's a nice and easy way of adding/removing deps as need be instead of depending on Git submodules. Granted moving over to dep will involve some work with the Makefile and the Travis script still.. Before we merge this in, I'm just gonna double-check things:\n\nWe want the Gopkg.lock file so I should unmodify the .gitignore file and include the lock file.\nBy deleting the submodules and vendor folder, will this affect the go get process of cloning the code? Once it gets cloned it won't have access to the libs like rateio so it won't be able to build without having dep installed. Is this the correct way to go about this?\nWhich other projects use go dep successfully / have them built into their build process? I could use them for reference for how to go about this properly.. It only comes up when a theme has one color for names. To avoid that I gave the hacker theme two identical colors.\n. Here's the output in full from when a user tries activating a theme with only one color defined.\n\n```\n\u279c  ssh-chat git:(master) \u2717 ./ssh-chat\nListening for connections on [::]:2022\npanic: runtime error: integer divide by zero\n[signal 0x8 code=0x1 addr=0x57e0eb pc=0x57e0eb]\ngoroutine 10 [running]:\npanic(0x8c6420, 0xc82000a0f0)\n    /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/panic.go:481 +0x3e6\ngithub.com/shazow/ssh-chat/chat/message.Theme.ColorName(0x965bc8, 0x6, 0x7f6483c21780, 0xc82000b159, 0x7f6483c21780, 0xc82000b15a, 0x7f6483c217b0, 0xc82000b190, 0xc8200c9000, 0xc820254120, ...)\n    /home/steve/work/src/github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/chat/message/theme.go:120 +0xcb\ngithub.com/shazow/ssh-chat.GetPrompt(0xc820254120, 0x0, 0x0)\n    /home/steve/work/src/github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/host.go:23 +0xa7\ngithub.com/shazow/ssh-chat.(Host).Connect(0xc82014b360, 0xc82024fb00)\n    /home/steve/work/src/github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/host.go:170 +0x1054\ngithub.com/shazow/ssh-chat.(Host).Connect-fm(0xc82024fb00)\n    /home/steve/work/src/github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/host.go:185 +0x2a\ngithub.com/shazow/ssh-chat/sshd.(SSHListener).Serve.func1(0xc820170510, 0x7f6483b9d000, 0xc820026070)\n    /home/steve/work/src/github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/sshd/net.go:64 +0x146\ncreated by github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/sshd.(SSHListener).Serve\n    /home/steve/work/src/github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/sshd/net.go:65 +0x1e7\n```\n.

Also, the test previously worked in 0.01 seconds.\n\n\nNot sure what caused the test to start failing.. I did it with Go 1.8, but I believe it's still a problem in 1.6 and 1.7, as per the Travis build.\nSee the Travis build here. I filed an issue for that in #231.\nEdit: im dumb. The linter says Line 125 on host.go, but I think the problem carried over from the batch of commits you added on the refactor branch. Here's the diff from doing git diff master..theme-stuff -- host.go\n```diff\n-       if h.isOp(term.Conn) {\n-               h.Room.Ops.Add(set.Itemize(member.ID(), member))\n+       if key := term.Conn.PublicKey(); key != nil {\n+               authItem, err := h.auth.ops.Get(newAuthKey(key))\n+               if err == nil {\n+                       err = h.Room.Ops.Add(set.Rename(authItem, member.ID()))\n+               }\n+       }\n+       if err != nil {\n+               logger.Warningf(\"[%s] Failed to op: %s\", term.Conn.RemoteAddr(), err)\n        }\n-       ratelimit := rateio.NewSimpleLimiter(3, time.Second*3)\n\nratelimit := rateio.NewSimpleLimiter(3, time.Second*3)\n        logger.Debugf(\"[%s] Joined: %s\", term.Conn.RemoteAddr(), user.Name())\n```\n\nIt claims that err = h.Room.Ops.Add(set.Rename(authItem, member.ID())) is an ineffective assign. But I'm not entirely certain as to why.\nEdit: changing target branch to master as per previous discussion to develop features from master.. Updated to use a single byte buffer instead of sending two separate messages. I used three spaces to keep it properly indented with the system message arrow. I didn't do the inner check skip just because I thought it would further complicate it a bit.. Closed, will come back to this idea at a later time.. Related to #231. sshd and ssh-chat should be running on separate ports. ssh-chat's default port is 2022 and it can be changed when launching ssh-chat with the --bind option (eg. --bind 0.0.0.0:2022).\nYou might want to check netstat --listen to see which programs are listening on which ports.. In order to port ssh-chat to using go dep, the solution would require crafting a Gopkg.toml file with the packages, changing the Makefile to account for downloading packages through dep, and removing any submodules from the Git tracker to avoid extra cloning.\ndep puts all dependencies into the local vendor/ folder, making the Git submodule clones (the ones stored under $GOPATH/github.com) unnecessary.\nI tested this by running dep init, deleting the vendor/ folder in the project, deleting all the extra folders under $GOPATH/github.com and seeing if the build failed, which it did. Then I ran dep ensure to clone the dependencies to vendor/ and ran the build again, which ran successfully.\nI prefer the dependencies to be listed in a file like with Gopkg.toml because it's a nice and easy way of adding/removing deps as need be instead of depending on Git submodules. Granted moving over to dep will involve some work with the Makefile and the Travis script still.. Before we merge this in, I'm just gonna double-check things:\n\nWe want the Gopkg.lock file so I should unmodify the .gitignore file and include the lock file.\nBy deleting the submodules and vendor folder, will this affect the go get process of cloning the code? Once it gets cloned it won't have access to the libs like rateio so it won't be able to build without having dep installed. Is this the correct way to go about this?\nWhich other projects use go dep successfully / have them built into their build process? I could use them for reference for how to go about this properly.. \n",

I didn't see anywhere to add an applicable unit test :/. @shazow Definitely happy to help!. Fixes #231 \nTo be honest I'm not sure why the signature originally was that it was hanging, that might be an issue in itself, but things are green now!. Looks like we were never feeding channels that were waiting if the SSH connection errored out. Fixed.\nTesting:\n```\n23:08:17 \ue0b0 ograff@Olivers-MacBook-Air \ue0b0 ...github.com/shazow/ssh-chat \ue0b0 \ue0a0 master \u2714 \ue0b0\n$ git checkout -b fix_hang_but_not_test\nSwitched to a new branch 'fix_hang_but_not_test'\n23:08:27 \ue0b0 ograff@Olivers-MacBook-Air \ue0b0 ...github.com/shazow/ssh-chat \ue0b0 \ue0a0 fix_hang_but_not_test \u2714 \ue0b0\n$ git show fix_unit_tests | cat\ncommit c073e1f3f0fad434d86ac6f63be99dfc0b3fe535\nAuthor: Oliver Graff oliver.e.graff@gmail.com\nDate:   Tue Jun 13 22:57:32 2017 -0700\nFix host_test so it will not hang if the SSH connection fails\n\ndiff --git a/host_test.go b/host_test.go\nindex 334506e..f98724a 100644\n--- a/host_test.go\n+++ b/host_test.go\n@@ -97,6 +97,7 @@ func TestHostNameCollision(t testing.T) {\n            return nil\n        })\n        if err != nil {\n+           done <- struct{}{}\n            t.Fatal(err)\n        }\n    }()\n@@ -203,6 +204,7 @@ func TestHostKick(t testing.T) {\n            return nil\n        })\n        if err != nil {\n+           connected <- struct{}{}\n            close(connected)\n            t.Fatal(err)\n        }\n@@ -218,6 +220,7 @@ func TestHostKick(t *testing.T) {\n            return nil\n        })\n        if err != nil {\n+           close(done)\n            t.Fatal(err)\n        }\n        close(done)\n23:08:34 \ue0b0 ograff@Olivers-MacBook-Air \ue0b0 ...github.com/shazow/ssh-chat \ue0b0 \ue0a0 fix_hang_but_not_test \u2714 \ue0b0\n$ git cherry-pick fix_unit_tests\n[fix_hang_but_not_test c36c3ff] Fix host_test so it will not hang if the SSH connection fails\n Date: Tue Jun 13 22:57:32 2017 -0700\n 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)\n23:08:41 \ue0b0 ograff@Olivers-MacBook-Air \ue0b0 ...github.com/shazow/ssh-chat \ue0b0 \ue0a0 fix_hang_but_not_test \u2714 \ue0b0\n$ go test -v\n=== RUN   TestAuthWhitelist\n--- PASS: TestAuthWhitelist (0.01s)\n=== RUN   TestHostGetPrompt\n--- PASS: TestHostGetPrompt (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestHostNameCollision\n--- FAIL: TestHostNameCollision (0.01s)\n    host_test.go:101: ssh: must specify HostKeyCallback\n    host_test.go:124: ssh: must specify HostKeyCallback\n=== RUN   TestHostWhitelist\n--- FAIL: TestHostWhitelist (0.01s)\n    host_test.go:152: ssh: must specify HostKeyCallback\n=== RUN   TestHostKick\n--- FAIL: TestHostKick (0.01s)\n    host_test.go:224: ssh: must specify HostKeyCallback\nFAIL\nexit status 1\nFAIL    github.com/shazow/ssh-chat  0.055s\n23:08:45 \ue0b0 \u2718 \ue0b0 ograff@Olivers-MacBook-Air \ue0b0 ...github.com/shazow/ssh-chat \ue0b0 \ue0a0 fix_hang_but_not_test \u2714 \ue0b0\n$```.

I was having a conundrum with that bit.  Initially I wanted to see if it was possible to have a user option that could enable/disable timestamps.  If the user entered /ts for example, it would trigger a boolean. Anyway it only partially worked because the prompts are sent in a different manner than the messages, and I absolutely needed both of these to have it.\nAh well... back to the drawing board.  Cheers!. I didn't notice it in the code... Do you think any of this code can be reused to add a timestamp to the prompts?. I'll test with the function you mention.  I'm just wondering how I might add timestamps to the \"prompt\" line.  EG: own messages.. I'm going to open up a proper feature request... . Here is a screenshot of the change I propose.  The timestamps would be enabled or disabled globally on the host as a command line option.  For example:  --timestamps\n\n. I'm going to try a shot at the third option....

Would need to rewrite where the prompt is set which might be a fair bit of work.\n\nI had to modify ./vendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal/terminal.go to export clearAndRepaintLinePlusNPrevious to make this work. The prompt can be updated without this function, but the update will not be visible on the client side. For example, if one begins typing at 15:00 and then hits enter at 15:01, the message would be still be stamped with 15:00. Since it's updated on the server side, however, it appears correctly as 15:01 to all other users. Unless there is another way to update the client prompt, an implementation of Option 2 is probably not reasonable for the main repo..

I now have it implemented this way in my local fork. \nI got a bit of tunnel vision after finding that clearAndRepaintLinePlusNPrevious suited my needs, and did not look too deeply into its implementation. The function needed to send information back to the client is t.c.Write in golang's terminal.go, which is indirectly accessible from SetSize, Write, and ReadLine.\nEdit: The hacky implementation is now available at https://github.com/Atheatos/ssh-chat/tree/timestamps. .
