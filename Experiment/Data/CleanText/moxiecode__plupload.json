    "spocke": "There are a few issues with multipart/form-data one of them is that all files would have to be send in one big request so chunking wouldn't be possible. The other issue is that WebKit doesn't support direct file data access and we can there for not fake multipart encoding over XHR. And without XHR there isn't any events for progress etc.\nI guess one could have it optional and only for some specific runtimes.\n. Hopefully they will improve this. I've seen some comment on the Chrome blog where they said that they where working on improving the file access support.\n. We are prepping for the next release now of plupload. It will include multipart support for every runtime except HTML5 and WebKit. You will also be able to specify form parameters to be send in the upload request.\n. Yes it's in Chrome 6. But that's not released yet. And it seems to be in Safari 4.0.1 recently released. So it might be possible to do multipart in those browsers. Last time I tried on the Chrome Nightly it crashed. Will fiddle with this next week.\n. Interesting, I though FormData was a Chrome 6 feature. I guess they released it early. I had some issues implementing it before can't remember exactly what the issues where. The progress might be solvable if one moves the event handler registration. Seems that different XHR implementations needs to have it at different places kind of confusing.\nIf we can get it to work then we would have mutlipart everywhere and therefor have it on by default since it's the more common way to handle file uploads.\n. Yes, the files are send as a binary stream not as mutlipart there is another issue open where I explain why we use direct binary streams instead of multipart encoding for the files.\n. Yes, the next version will have multipart support.\n. Nice to see that you find it useful and started a GWT integration. I hope your release that.\nHere are some answers to your questions:\n1) Did you call the uploader.refresh() method. It will reposition the shims.\n2) You should be able to have the div outside the dialog. This div contains the flash, silverlight etc and is moved on top of the target element. I think this problem is related to 1).\n3) Hmm, if the URLs to the flash movie is relative there shouldn't be any problems loading it from non default port. However I haven't tried it.\n. I know to little about GWT in fact I have never used it so I can't really help you there. It seems like this is some implementation issue rather than a bug or issue with the plupload API.\nThe upload.refresh will reposition the shims once fired so if they are at the wrong location then you probably need to fire that when the dialog opens or moves or similar.\n. Seems to exist a fork with a fix for this. But haven't tried it my self yet.\n. This is amazing stuff. Good work, I will add some details about this one to the next blog post.\n. There have been reports where it would produce errors if you have the development flash player installed. Have not verified this also it has only been tested with Flash 10.\n. Could you tell me more about your environment. Exact browser and Flash version and what OS and version you use. So I can try to setup a similar environment reproducing the issue.\nAlso does this occur on the examples on the www.plupload.com site or just in your integration. Could be some odd integration issue also.\nThanks\n. Could you send me a link to your system or the init code that's being used. Also try the latest github version if possible.\n. Could you send me the generated init call for the uploader. Could be that some item in the filters isn't properly setup by GWT. Maybe a datatype issue or similar.\n. This is outside the scope of this project since it's GWT related and not a bug issue inside plupload it self.\n. I fail to see how this would break since there shouldn't be a difference between dynamically adding stuff and having it there statically. Could be something else going on like multiple calls to the init or something.\n. Nice to hear that. I'm closing this then.\n. Yes, nothing should be static everything should be optional in one way or another.\n. The next release will have multipart and multipart_params support.\n. The names can be changed dynamically using events. Just did that for an integration project.\n. Yes, we should definitely add official support and documentation for handling the response. Also the error handling is currently lacking a global Error event should be useful producing a code and message with the error.\n. I added some initial support for handling HTTP responses.\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/e804b844b7904ab4a9b878bb258aff3d3993e155\nIt still needs some work to get status codes passed through on Flash/Silverlight and there should also be an official ChunkUploaded event with similar behavior.\n. Closing this one.\n. It's currently not possible to access the clipboard in any browser or runtime except maybe Java but who uses that these days. The HTML5 spec says that drag/drop and copy/paste should be treated equal so it's in the spec but no vendor has an implementation yet.\n. There is a bug for basic clipboard access for Gecko here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407983 hope fully it would have the same reference as the DropEvent.\n. Thanks for this detailed report. This is very helpful information.\n. Could not reproduce it on www.plupload.com using Nightly + Flash 10.1 beta 3 however this combo is very experimental. So you should use stable version of WebKit and Flash players.\n. I tested the latest B3 worked fine on FF, Chrome and Safari.\n. Image resizing in HTML 5 is currently only supported in Gecko. Webk\nKit doesn't have any direct file access API. But it seems to be under development.\n. We removed the single widget for now. Will reintroduce it later as a more simple but generic widget.\n. The core is and will remain library independent. Adding a element after another doesn't require much more code that you would need using jQuery. Some methods will add to the size of the plupload core but they are currently minor and I don't expect them to be much more than the ones we have in there today.\nThere are lots of other JS libraries out there so making plupload jQuery specific would be bad. We want to open up for widgets for other JS frameworks as well that would be hard if the core would be jQuery only.\n. He he, easy to forget that when you get most quirks solved by Resig and the rest of the jq team. Closing this issue down for now.\n. Yes, we have been thinking of adding a generic Error event. With some status codes for the different error types. This needs to be passed from Flash, Silverlight etc. We could also separate them up in different events having one for upload error and one for initialization errors that might occur.\n. Yep, but since the error might be due to to much data on the server or other issues. There must be a way to be able to trigger an error depending on the page response. I guess adding a error event then letting the user dispatch it from the FileUploaded event should do the trick. The file was sent to the server and hence \"uploaded\" but it failed when the data was processed on the server.\nNon 200 ok status on HTTP could be treated as an error directly since then there was something fundamentally wrong with the server.\n. I just added new support for error handeling. It will now detect HTTP error statuses, transport errors, io errors, security errors and you can do custom errors based on the output.\n. Closing this down since errors are now handled.\n. We updated the documentation now since we just released the 1.1 version.\n. It works when I try it. Generates unique names for the files on the examples on our site at least.\n. Fixed this now in the core and released a 1.1.1 version.\n. Then your debugger isn't working correctly. It probably doesn't display binary data in the view or something.\nJust tested it my self using the same setup and Fiddler and I could see the multipart data correctly. Try Fiddler instead, it's a superb HTTP debugger.\n. Works fine in FF 3.6 on the example here: http://www.plupload.com/example_all_runtimes.php\nUsed HTTP Fiddler to verify that the file is send correctly. So it sounds like an implementation issue. Also does it matter if it sends all other inputs as well, I mean they are normally not as much data as a file.\n. Check out the latest GitHub version. I changed the way it detects and sets up forms.\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/bf1bcf72597f8b372fa200448423a9ede3f3bd05\n. It will generate an unique file name if the unique_names option is enabled. So remove that and you should be able to set what ever name you want.\n. That can easily be done on the server. You can pass in the directory name in the query string or generate an unique one on the server.\n. Could you elaborate on this feature? Size and file name filters or do you mean something else?\n. Sure I guess those could be dynamic. The Silverlight runtime needs to be modified though so it supports a method for setting it. It's now passed in as a init option.\n. Getting closer on this one. The flash runtime will now update the filters if you do a upload.refresh. Just need to add a similar feature to Silverlight.\n. Hmm, use Flash Develop if you are on Windows and Flex SDK. Both are free.\n. Fixed this issue now in the GitHub trunk. Will add this to the next release.\n. Closing this issue.\n. It's now possible to turn of chunking. But that will also turn of progress.\n. You can cancel upload of files on each specific chunk or the whole queue by simply stopping it. For example if you trigger an file error inside a ChunkUploaded event all remaining chunks will be canceled.\n. This is fixed.\n. Could be that the UI thread doesn't have enough CPU to update. Could try to switch from post to send then it will block the upload until the UI thread gets the message. Could result in slower uploads. :(\n. Yep, seems to be some bug in the 5.x beta version of Chrome. Works on the stable 4 version. But since the browser isn't a stable and official version we will not add any fixes to plupload to support it until they release a release candidate or final.\nI reported it to the Gears team here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=1009\n. This is fixed both in Chrome and in our code.\n. Probably a server issue. It will automatically stop the upload if the server responds with a non 200 ok HTTP status.\n. Sounds like an implementation issue not a bug since it works with the shipped upload script.\n. The onInit will send out a object with a runtime property.\n. Feature already exists.\n. Did you manage to produce this scrambled upload? I guess the increment should be moved else where preferable to the \n. Will resolve this for the upcoming release.\n. Fixed. Thanks for detailed instructions. Feel free to fork and contribute.\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/fed16774a195534eace438b2430911deef7448d6\n. Does it work on the examples on our site. If it does it's a server issue you need to resolve and not a issue with Plupload. If it doesn't then there might be some Flash related bug we need to look into.\n. Latest version works fine for me using both small and large files and with/without the chunking feature enabled. Closing this down since it can't be reproduced. Sounds like a implementation issue.\n. This is not a bug in plupload. Fix your server settings.\n. Can it be reproduced on the examples on our site. Or is it implementation specific?\n. I also think they removed the cache for the swf by having random urls not ideal.\n. All examples works fine on FF 3 on Win7, Win Vista and Mac OS X. Could be some odd extension issue or adblocker.\n. Bind them in the right order.\n. Bind them before/after init. Init will add default handlers so I guess you want to bind these after.\n. Could be a bug with the Flash runtime. I haven't really compared the order of upload progress and file uploaded across all runtimes. Will try to add some unit tests for all this in the future. It's a bit tricky since I need to fake memory buffers some how to make it totally automatic.\n. That sounds like a possible cause of the problem. Will try to fix that a.s.a.p.\n. This is now resolved. It will now use get/setAttribute.\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/83e9a09de8c53bdec2a719ecf2817b3b9562f807\n. Hmm, does the filename have odd characters as well. Since you can upload binary files I see no reason why more simple files shouldn't work.\n. This one should no longer be a problem.\n. Fixed in this commit:\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/cd0721b86bce76c676d1df40b4a1a0497c7e7c46\n. Looks like an implementation issue. Probably some server issue.\n. You need to bind the events in the right order. Add your binding before the init() call. Since the init call will register a default action for FileUploaded that will take the next queue item and upload that. So if you want to break the queue you need to intercept it before that happens.\n. Yes it needs to be documented.\n. I added it to the docs now. We will switch the docs to a wiki based system soon so it's easier to change them and add information.\n. Fixed:\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/bb975713e40a758d8272054b776babdad7cd8816\n. Read up on the same origin policy.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/En/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript\nThis is not a Plupload bug.\n. I don't think it's possible. Seems hardcoded into the browser.\n. Closing this since a.f.a.i.k. it's impossible to fix.\n. Hmm, this method seems interesting however it doesn't seem to work on the latest Firefox or Opera. But it works on IE and WebKit, could be some odd security feature since it worked according to the author on FF 1.5. Will need to investigate this method further thanks for the tip.\n. Hmm, maybe they re-implemented it since it doesn't work on my FF 3.6. It's hard to feature detect this thing and there is the potential that they remove it again in the future on other browsers since it's a bit of a hack. Will try to find some bug report with this on bugzilla and see if there is a reason why the removed then added it again.\n. Fix this issue and a bunch of other things. Could you verify it on your browser version.\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/83e9a09de8c53bdec2a719ecf2817b3b9562f807\n. Are you trying do do some cross domain upload. That is not supported unless you set cross domain XHR headers etc on the server.\n. I couldn't reproduce the issue on Windows using 3.0.19 portable edition. So I guess it only happens on Linux and the market share of the old FF 3.0 on Linux is probably less than 1% so it's not something we will focus on fixing. Unless you can help out with development and testing for this specific browser version.\n. I don't follow you on this one. Is the uploader.files array incorrect only when you pick files with multiple dots in them? Could you provide me with some example page where this is happening. I tired to pick and upload a file with multiple dots in them and it worked fine.\nThe documentation is probably wrong if it states that the second argument is a file. I guess thats becasue it used to be a FileRemove event and we changed it to a FilesRemoved event. I will look over that.\nRegarding the possibility to use the development version. I would grab the github repo then use the queue_widget_dev.html it will load the source versions of the JS files.\n. Could be that iso isn't allowed by your filters setting. Send me a link with a page where I can reproduce the problem and I will look into it.\n. I managed to open it again. Not that impressed with the issue tracker.\nAnyway, could it be the size restriction limit. If you select an ISO it's larger than 10mb that we defined by default in the examples?\n. This seems to be some form of implementation issue. Could you provide me with a link where the issue is easily reproduced so I can confirm this bug. Currently everything works as expected when I try it on the examples etc.\n. It was a mistake I made when checking the extensions manually in JS. Just pushed a fix for it.\n. Fixed this issue and just released a new version.\n. The only way we would ever use UrlStream is A) If Adobe fixes the bug with Cookies not being retained or B) When a user specifies a authentication token.\nWe want the upload to just work the same on all runtimes. Using FileReference.upload would mean that only for Flash you would have to add the security token due to the cookie bug Adobe has. We bumped this bug multiple times at Adobe they don't seem interested in fixing it. It's been in there from Flash 8.\n. Yes, I mean FileReference.upload sorry about that.\nIt looks like the current implementation will be the default unless you use a authentication token then we might switch to a different model.\nThere are also the issue with chunks. FileReference.Upload doesn't support chunks or at least I wasn't able to do anything with the ByteArray they have before uploading so that feature will also be broken.\nSo it won't work well out of the box so it can never be default. The current implementation works pretty good out of the box except for huge files and it also produces a odd progress since there is no send progress event for the UrlStream object.\nBut if you are a Flash developer you could fork the project add this feature in and I can pull that in later on since we won't focus on adding this support any time soon since it would break other things.\n. Ahh! Just found out some great news. It seems that Adobe is finally looking in to the cookie bug. This would make it possible to use the FileReference.upload at least when chunking is disabled and still retain session state. But it will also not be possible to do client side image resizing so even if they fix the cookie bug and we use the FileReference.Upload we will loose features. :(\n. Yep, we will probably do it optional and switched of by default since it breaks different features. We can also switch to the FileReference.upload method automatically ones Adobe fixes the cookie bug that is currently the show stopper here for using this out of the box.\nFor example if the chunk size is configured to 10mb we could use the filereference.upload method to upload files smaller than that etc to get progress. And if it's not defined at all we can use it for everything except images if the resizing is defined.\n. Yes, it has been discussed before but the FileReference.upload is very buggy. Doesn't support sessions, doesn't support custom headers, doesn't work properly over https, doesn't work properly over basic authentication. Just to name a few.\n. But we plan to support it soon. Since Adobe finally recognized the issues. Been bumping that bug report for years.\n. Well we all runtimes to work the same way. And if we where to use FileReference.upload it wouldn't support chunking or jpeg resizing and the other things stated. We could check if the user has specified an authtoken or something like swfupload but that will only be used by Flash. We might implement something like this, but we would then have to use two methods of upload to support chunking etc.\nI don't know about \"missing plugins\" Plupload checks if the browser supports the different runtimes and degrades down the chain and finally to HTML4 so it will always work so I don't see your problem.\nThe browser might crash if you upload insane file sizes like 1GB or so since both Gecko and Flash will load the whole file into memory before sending it.\n. This one has been solved and released.\n. I guess this is an implementation issue since it works on our examples on the www.plupload.com site right?\n. Yes, the current implementation loads data into memory before uploading. This is because of the buggy upload logic Adobe provides. We will however change this behavior as soon as Adobe releases a fix for the cookie issue it currently have. But this solution will not work with chunking or with images that is down scaled.\n. We added the multipart feature check fairly recently I think. The GitHub version will check for data access support. So it should return false on WebKit for example.\n. Seems to work just fine. Tested it on Firefox and Safari both returned status 4 and that is the failed status code.\n. Ahh, yes. Linux build of Gecko seems to have a bug where it's impossible to get the right HTTP status out.\n. But linux users is less than 1% so I don't see a major problem. If you really need linux support use the response for errors not the status.\n. Just tested it on 3.6.3 on Ubuntu works fine there as well. So I guess it's a broken build on Gentoo or something.\n. Well I can't reproduce it on any OS including Ubuntu. So there isn't much I can do about this.\n. Then it's an implementation issue. For example posting from one domain to another is not allowed unless you have the proper headers etc.\n. It's doesn't seem to be a bug in the plupload code at least since it can't be reproduced.\n. But then they would need to see a preview of it. That could be problematic on some browsers like IE to do on the client side.\n. The problem isn't the rotation but rather the need for having a live preview so that you know what the image will look like ones it's uploaded. The current resize feature doesn't alter the appearance of the image.\nIt's tricky to add this feature in a easy to use way and impossible on some IE browsers due to the lack of the data url scheme for images.\nWe don't want to add features that can't be used on all browsers. We have a few of them already in there but hopefully they will be flushed out soon when WebKit supports chunking and direct data access for files. It's in their trunk now so it's coming soon.\nI don't think this is a feature that would be ideal for plupload at least not now. But if some one makes a nice fork and adds it would consider pulling it in. But it's not something I feel we should focus on.\n. Yes, but that is preview inside flash. We need to be able to preview it inside HTML so Flash needs to send out a bytearray encoded into base64 or something to be used as a data: url inside an image element. But since the data scheme isn't supported by IE 6 and IE 7 it will be difficult.\n. I'm closing this one since it's not in the scope of this project.\n. I don't think plupload has a context menu nor an advanced theme. I guess you wanted to report this as a bug on the TinyMCE project on SourceForge maybe?\n. Yes, I've tested it on Windows and Mac under Chrome 5. Chrome 6 doesn't exist yet, sure it's good to test once in a while on alpha/beta versions but they should never be used as a real production browser. It's called beta for a reason, I guess Google has destroyed that word by having all their services in beta but having live users on them.\n. Oh, by the way it works fine on the latest Chromium nightly.\n. Yep, and it's a later build. Tested it using 6.0.418.0 try that one. Tested it on PC though.\nChrome 5 also have splice support for blobs so I will implement chunking for Chrome soon.\n. I think Flash throws the error internally so it's might not be possible to grab the response. But I will investigate this see if it can be done.\n. Hmm, why should we add this. You can't add files to the collection dynamically anyway, they need to be picked by the user.\n. Hmm, you could just do your own custom implementation using the plupload API. Then just add the file size of the existing files. There is no need to add it to the queue, since it wouldn't serve much purpose.\n. I don't want to add this one since it would confuse people. The file would not be added to the queue when it's uploaded etc. I wan't to have the queue as private as possible since it connects to different backends.\n. But thanks for the patch and shown interest. \n. Does it work on the examples on the www.plupload.com site? What runtime doesn't work if you test the example with multiple runtimes?\n. The HTML4 and HTML5 on this example: http://www.plupload.com/example_all_runtimes.php works fine in my Ubuntu running FF 3.6.3.\nI modified the custom example a bit to make it easier to spot issues when picking to large files and it also didn't update the progress correctly since the events where bound before the init call.\nSo now everything works as expected on the custom example as well. The queue widget examples however has always worked correctly on all browsers and OS:es. I can't reproduce any issue there.\n. It works for me on all browsers including Ubuntu so as long as I can't reproduce it I can't fix it.\n. Thanks, yes makes a lot of sense. I changed that and fixed another issue. Thanks for the contribution.\n. I think the matching should be done in another way all together. If the user for example has a a.b.c extension or something.\n. Sure it should check the full length of the configured filter extension name.\n. Just remove the filters option and you will be able to upload any file typ.e\n. Just remove the filters settings all together if you want to upload any filetype.\n. Just realized that I'm repeating my self. Stressed out I guess. :) You can't specify . for all runtimes and if the user is supposed to be able to upload anything it's better to just remove the filer and do server side or custom validation of the file names. Or I'm I missing the point.\n. Don't know if we will support that option since all runtimes don't.\n. Could you send me the file so I can try it?\n. I will look into this issue and also make sure that the chunking is stopped when the user presses cancel.\n. You can disable image resizing. But could you provide me with a file with the bare minimum size to produce this issue so I can test and verify it. Thanks\n. If image resizing is disabled then there is no manipulation of the data at all so it's likely a server issue.\n. Yes, there is a way to clear the queue using the uploader.splice function but we used to have a clear method as well that would remove all of the files in queue.\n. I think that the object elements gets re-initialized when you set display: none and display: block. Use css('visibility', 'hidden') instead.\n. Yep, not much we can do about it in the Plupload project though. This is clearly a browser and implementation issue. Use visibility if you don't want it to re-initialize and possible position absolute depending on your implementation.\n. Will investigate this one. I guess you could just use a local variable within the gears runtime since we don't want to pollute the global name space. But since Gears are dead, no longer developed by Google we won't do much more work on that runtime just maintain it. But thanks for looking in to this issue.\n. I see, I guess one could stick it into the plupload object. Will try to reproduce this issue see what I can find out and possible fix by your solution.\n. Make sure that you have the correct mime type configured for .xap. And if you are loading it cross domain upgrade to the latest release.\n. Hmm, is this with chunking enabled/disabled? It allocates a lot of memory when it slices the files in Firefox since it needs to load the entire file into RAM before uploading it. They are going to introduce the slice method to FF 4 so I guess it will be better then. We will continue to improve the memory footprint when the browsers release better ways of handling files. The W3C spec if pretty well written so as long as they implement that in a correct way uploading huge files should be possible.\n. Wow! File names that long is probably problematic.\n. It's a bug in Chrome will report it to them as soon as I get some time to do it.\n. We will improve the S3 support for the next release by adding mime type mappings and removing the query string parameters when some options are disabled.\n. I haven't tried to upload to s3 yet. But it should work a lot better in theory since we now send the right mime types for all files on upload. Since Amazon uses that when they stream them out again. But I guess we could add some form of how to when we redesign the site, it's currently a bit limited.\n. Yes, it's faked using a hidden file input field. Pretty smart, might just use that. But I guess drag/drop of files are around the corner in Safari anyway since Chrome already have it in there and they share the same code base.\n. This is a known bug in Flash and can't be resolved. I wrote about it in the news post for the latest release. Check it out and hold your thumbs so Adobe gets this one fixed soon.\n. Yes, or you can pass it in the querystring using the url param.\n. Could you provide us with an example image that we can try out?\n. Hmm, probably need to reset the file size after scaling down the image.\n. Fixed this one. Thanks for the patch.\n. Closing...\n. The current upload.php file has a bug where it will create new files for each chunk it will be resolved in the next version. Other than that there isn't any issues with overwriting files since no files are uploaded in parallel.\n. Ahh, then the unique_names is the thing for you. It will generate globally unique names for the files based on random numbers the time and a file counter. So it's virtually impossible to get two files with the same name.\n. We will send both file names to the server in the upcoming release. The random one will be passed as the name parameter and the original file name will be passed as the filename for the actual upload in multipart. It will only send both names in multipart_mode. However the form will contain the unique names. If you want to make your own uniqueness just pass in a random number or session id or similar to the upload.php script on your backend it could then ensure that they are unique for that window. I think this is easy to solve on the backend of your system. Just disable unique_names and set a id to upload like upload.php?id=.\n. Pulled in a similar fix.\n. Thanks for this patched pulled it in and it seems to work just fine.\n. Thanks for the patch. I added it to the master.\n. I think this is some form of config issue. Never seen it produce 400 chunks for such a small file unless the chunk size is very small. The Flash runtime will chunk images by default since uploading streams in flash isn't possible if you want to have real progress so the progress is faked using a default set of chunks to get 25, 50, 75 and 100%.\n. Yes, the Flash runtime will use the built in logic in Flash to upload if the file isn't an image or if resizing is disabled. Then the progress will be real instead of fake.\nCouldn't reproduce any issue:\n1. Opened http://www.plupload.com/example_all_runtimes.php\n2. Selected a image that was 140k\n3. Uploaded the file it got resized to 37k.\n4. Noticed that it did 4 requests to the server using HTTP Fiddler each request 10k exept the last one that was smaller.\nDidn't get 400 requests only 4.\n. I confirmed it now even on our examples on the plupload site. Seems to be something wrong with the chunking calculation since it adds unneeded chunks. Will try the latest GitHub version tomorrow see if I can reproduce it on that one as well.\n. There was an issue if chunking was enabled and the file size was lower than a specific size. I corrected that one and my test files are now uploading correctly. Could you grab the GitHub version and confirm it.\n. Yes, I don't know what I was thinking with the last commit. The new one works as expected tested it on multiple files, small, large etc with different chunk sizes and chunking disabled. Can be downloaded here: http://github.com/downloads/moxiecode/plupload/plupload.zip\n. Looks like a solid fix. We will look into adding this to the code base. Thanks.\n. ",
    "rjcoelho": "I didn't explained correctly. Existing forms aren't ready to accepts multiple files.

    "sjarvela": "Thanks for the reply, I will of course release it separately once I get it working.\n1) When exactly should I call refresh? I'm asking since I already get refresh events FROM plupload whenever I move the dialog, so I cannot call it in refresh callback or I will cause infinite loop.\n2) Unfortunately no, it is working just fine (except for the dragging) when I have the dialog non-modal, but once I set it to modal, it stops working (shim doesn't appear over the element, and browse dialog cannot be opened). Don't know if it's the way how GWT makes it modal (some kind of glass pane div, I suppose).\n3) Yes I though so as well, but I always get the error no matter how I give the url. I was asking since SWFUpload, for example, doesn't give any such errors.\n. I'm not sure which problem was this delay meant for, but it did not solve the modality issue. Just to clarify, I never meant it would be a problem in your API, if you look at my first post, I was merely asking you to consider possibility of extending the API so that I could tell Plupload where to insert the runtime div (as I said, it solves the modality issue, only coordinates would have to be calculated differently).\nBut for the moving, I got it working, and I can live with non-modal dialog for now. Thanks for the help.\n. Good to know, I might try it at some point, but for now I can live with current version.\nFYI, GWT wrapper for Plupload is now available at http://code.google.com/p/gwt-plupload/\n. I've been testing Plupload for a while now, and cannot find a solution to problems with flash runtime I mentioned earlier.\nI've got Flash working only on Safari, not with other browsers (whereas Browserplus seems to work with all). I've also got feedback from other people, and seems like same problems for all of them. It doesn't have anything to do with ports or cross-site scripting, I've ruled them out.\nSince it does work with Safari, it shouldn't be because of the setup. I've debugged with source versions of Plupload js, and the error \"Error calling method on NPObject\" comes from plupload.flash.js line 147 (\"getFlashObj().setFileFilters(filters, uploader.settings.multi_selection);\"). So the flash component gets initialized, but calling it from js fails.\nDebugging version of flash player shows following error:\nTypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed: cannot convert Object@200e8bf1 to Array.\n    at Function/http://adobe.com/AS3/2006/builtin::apply()\n    at flash.external::ExternalInterface$/_callIn()\n    at ()\nAny ideas what's wrong here?\n. Actually I only installed the debug player (version 10) yesterday to see what was the error about, so it's not the cause.\n. I'm developing on Mac OS X 10.6.2 with MAMP, testing mainly with Safari 4 and Firefox 3.5.8 & Firebug 1.5.2, and Flash Player 10.0.45.2.\nI've continued debugging the js/flash communication, and since the error came from setting filters, I removed the filter parameter which got me little further. Now I can select files, but when I start upload, I get following error:\nArgumentError: Error #1063: Argument count mismatch on com.plupload::Plupload/uploadFile(). Expected 7, got 3.\nExample at Plupload.com seems to work, so this might very well be integration issue, just like the objects passed would be invalid structure etc. But it is weird that Flash works on Safari, and Browserplus on both, can't figure out any good reason for this.\n. Okay, I think I've got the problems solved (for now, at least). As I was setting up a test env for you, I noticed that everything worked just fine. So the argument mismatch error was somehow related to the GWT development environment, and did not occur on compiled version.\nBut the original coercion issue remained, and occurred only if filters were given in the settings. I tried with following modification in plupload.flash.js init (which just creates a copy of the exact same data instead of modifying the original), and now also filters works.\nf = []\nfor (i = 0; i < filters.length; i++) {\n    f[i] = {title:filters[i].title, extensions:\".\" + filters[i].extensions.replace(/,/g, \";.\")};\n}\ngetFlashObj().setFileFilters(f, uploader.settings.multi_selection);\nAny ideas what could cause this?\n. That's easier said than done :) GWT compiles Java into js in a not that readable format, but sure you can take a look.\nA test env is at http://www.mollify.org/test/ (user:test, pw:test), just click + button in toolbar and add file. Source version of plupload js files are used there, so you could just add a breakpoint there and see what kind of object is passed.\nThe generated code is here: http://www.mollify.org/test/debug-client/FE56A2381ACE75A1A84D9183843EF5D4.cache.html (actually js even though has a html extension). Plupload builder code for adding filters is around line 28216, but getting the big picture from that file is really really hard even now when it is not obfuscated.\nI can tell that builder has a the internal settings object, where it puts all the stuff in plupload format. When plupload instance is created, it simply passes that object to it. Adding filter in plain js is\nprivate native void addFilters(String title, String extensions) /*-{\n    if (!this.@plupload.client.PluploadBuilder::settings['filters'])\n        this.@plupload.client.PluploadBuilder::settings['filters'] = [];\n    this.@plupload.client.PluploadBuilder::settings['filters'].push({title:title, extensions: extensions});\n}-*/;\nSyntax may look a bit odd, but its the GWT way of defining native (which is javascript) functions. Unless it is wrong to use push with js arrays, I don't know how wrong can this be.\n. I think the correct way would be start looking from the \"end\", and add parts one by one if needed. As soon as a match is found, the extension is ok, but once the list has been iterated to the name part (which is the first item in list), we know the extension is invalid.\nFor example, if file is \"something.a.b.c\", it would first look for \"c\" then \"b.c\" and finally \"a.b.c\", and give up if none is found.\n.

I have sent a pull request - https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/pull/333\n. Yes, but it does set dataAccessSupport to false, which kills resizing.\nI'm still looking into that bit.\n. @jayarjo - why don't you remove the hack for now - stability is more important than features.\n. The compromise is to not to try and hack in features that don't exist or reliably work in some browsers but rather to let plupload fallback to another runtime, as it is designed to do.\n. HTML5 works fine in Webkit (without resizing) and Firefox (with resizing) if the sendAsBinary hack is removed.\n. ",
    "benwillard": "Just in case anyone else runs into the same problem, the issue that sjarvela was seeing is caused by the way GWT uses iframes as described here.\n\nBecause GWT code runs in an iframe, the Array object (and prototype of \nany array created within the iframe) is not the same as $wnd.Array. \nIn other words, \"instanceof\" won't work cross-frame; this is a known \nJS flaw\n\nFlash gets confused and sees []s  as Objects instead.

We will come up with similar solution for other runtimes as well.\n. Flash runtime now has this too. SilverLight next.\n. There was indeed a bug with FileReference.upload(); approach, like the final UploadProgress was dispatched after FileUploaded. Fixed in the latest commit now.\n. How did you conclude that these are parameters that break the upload to S3. Are you trying to upload to publicly writable bucket?\nI would like to sort this out, as I think that this can be useful feature too. We could even come up with additional functionality to support Amazon S3 and other CDNs.\n. Re-opened this one, looks like you've closed it accidentally?\n. There's no way to disable Filename param, btw, only Flash runtime adds it, and we need name parameter in other runtimes for obvious reasons. So we can't disable it, but you could take into account that extra parameter when dealing with Pandastream, as we do in S3 example, for example.\n. I'm not sure if any of flash or other then java uploaders can handle this any better. Are you aware of any? Doesn't YUI uploader load the whole thing in memory, or SWFUpload? Chunking with flash has other benefits like bypassing server constraints, compliance with HTTPS, cookies, etc.\n. Flash runtime usually loads slow, when you load the file directly form the hard drive. Should be quick when loaded through the web server, either local or remote. Is this the case?\n. @tekbird maybe lacks support for chunked upload, but very nice otherwise :)\n. Here is another example: https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.plUploadHandler\n. This has never been adressed by Adobe, so we had brought the default upload method back. It still has some problems, specifically with sessions, but they're solvable, as opposed to out of memory issue :|\n. As others have stated above basic upload resume is already possible, so pausing - by stopping uploader and resuming by manually setting loaded offset in the file object.\nBetter resuming of chunk uploads is implemented in Plupload 3.x, that is being prepared for a stable release at the moment. More details in: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1472.. Looks like this one got fixed? Or no?\n. This has been addressed in Plupload 2. 400+ status code are properly reported now, however returning response body in the Error event is not always possible. Flash and Silverlight runtimes depending on the mode are not able to access it. I still consider a suggestion though to somehow make it available when possible or maybe introducing another required feature that will auto-switch Plupload into the mode that supports this and filters out the runtimes that do not.\n. Is your browse button visible, or you hide it, one way or another?\n. In the recent release we now have a similar property - send_file_name which by default is set to true (for backward compatibility). One can set it to false to disable sending of additional params with the request.\n. I think this is something that can be implemented without touching the core - thanks to Pluploads rich event model. But of course it's poorly documented at the moment - our fault :) going to improve situation in this direction.\nFor example one might hook onto FilesAdded and alter file statuses to something like PENDING (default is QUEUED). Any status different then QUEUED, will be ignored by uploader, it will simply progress to the next one. Then you could initiate procedure of getting required info from third parties and once they are ready, set corresponding files status back to QUEUED. \nUploader progresses through the queue until it reaches the end of files array (UploadComplete is thrown), the only additional thing you would need to do is restart it to the the beginning of the array with: uploader.start(); and cycle through it again and again until all of the files have statuses of either DONE or FAILED, or some kind of timeout reached.\n. Right, it won't work with short living urls... Another thing one might do is simply override default FileUploaded event. Here is its code:\n```\nself.bind(\"FileUploaded\", function(up, file) {\n    file.status = plupload.DONE;\n    file.loaded = file.size;\n    up.trigger('UploadProgress', file);\n// Upload next file but detach it from the error event\n// since other custom listeners might want to stop the queue\n\ndelay(function() {\n         uploadNext.call(self);\n    }, 1);\n});\n```\nIf you bind a handler to FileUploaded before you call uploader.init(); and return false at the end, then default handler won't be called and you can execute arbitrary logic and upload next file from the queue manually. Would that be a solution to async thing?\nThe only problem with this is that there is currently no way to initiate upload of the next or specific file from a queue, manually... But I think making it public (there should be a way to do this anyway), could be a better decision. What do you think?\n. This has been finally fixed in latest commit.\n. We have fixed this issue in the latest html5 runtime through the newest ExifParser, which basically retains image info through the scale procedure. We already got a flash port, but it needs some testing. It will definitely find it's way into the next release.\n. Do you use multipart upload or chunking, and what's more important do you use our bundled upload.php?\n. Uploads just fine. Actually both flash and silverlight managed to properly resize it. Flash does that quite blurry, but that's what it's capable of (maybe we should really disable that blur filter?).\nNew release is coming out these days. We can't repeat this issue, so I will close it by now.\n. Yep, I guess it is. Closed by #148.\n. @lakeydesigner this thread is not actual anymore. It's about deprecated 1.x version. What exactly is your problem?\n. First error seems to be a NetworkError, that is not related to Plupload. I'd suggest that that you solve it first. The rest might just go away after you do so.\n. Doesn't seem to be a problem with Plupload 2.x. Try here: http://play.plupload.com/s__J_/2.. Silverlight is best from wide-spread platforms at the moment to handle big files. HTML5 is actually the worst. Situation may change though as browsers evolve.\n. Even if it's still an issue (which it shouldn't be) I do not think we can do anything about it.. This has been fixed now, thank you for your suggestions and feedback.\n. Flash: Help ExternalInterface to escape strings properly, as suggested in #88.

We added public destroy method to Plupload.uploader now. You can call it as: uploader.destroy(); which on it's turn raises Destroy event, which is then used by runtimes to remove event listeners and all mark-up. HTML5 is already ready to go. Cleaning other runtimes at the moment.\n. Added an example in PHP of Plupload to S3. Closed by f40916973c1b67944e934bf204a19b4e7f078ec5.\n. max_file_count has been introduced in Plupload UI Widget. Just download the latest version from github. Uploading more than one file at a time probably won't get in Core any time soon.\n. When you say 'upload button' do you mean 'Add Files' button, or 'Start Upload'? Do you still observe this issue? Can't repeat it on the example page you reference.\n. Hm... do not see it in Firefox 3.6.13. Can anyone else confirm this?\n. Yes. I even artificially made browser window much smaller, so that I could make two or three scrolls before I get to the button. Opens with single click. Another thing to make sure - is it really flash? I see gears is the first runtime in the list in that example. Do you got gears installed? \n. Weird. I actually heard of such problem in IEs, but never in other browsers. Are you having a similar problem with SilverLight as well?\nCould you try out this script: http://jactivating.sourceforge.net/en/, it's standalone, you could load it after Plupload, and let us know if it helps you.\n. You can always add that functionality to widget manually, simply by including UI Sortable behavior and initializing it on the list of files. Should work without problem I think.\n. Right. This is not exactly an issues, as there is no way to measure a hidden element properly. So you need to manually refresh uploader interface after you show it. Check this forum post for example: http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=391\n. There were some big fixes to Flash runtime. Could you try out latest version from github and let us know if the issue in question is still true?\n. Shouldn't be a problem in Plupload 2.x and up.. This bugfix might be related. Bug occurred when one of the images was filtered out due to size or extension constraints. In this case only first chunk for the very first image in the list was uploaded. And it affected only flash runtime.\nIt is fixed now. @Eddymarais, please confirm if you can.\n. It is possible probably... why not? But you will have to write a plugin for TinyMCE, server-side handler, etc. We do have such solution, but we sell it... ;)\nHere: http://www.moxiemanager.com/demos/tinymce.php\n. Right. That will be done.\n. We do not have centralized place for this on our site, but it is always possible to download previous releases from the github: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/releases.\n. This has been fixed with the latest commit.\n. This should be fixed in coming release I guess.\n. Is this one still an issue, with the latest commits?\n. Yeah... nice idea. I think it will find it's place on the updated Plupload website.\n. Sure. Interesting why we haven't had that. Next version will have it for sure and then once we introduce an archive of older versions, fix will get into them too.\n. There will be a special public variable in plupload object now - plupload.version and there will be a version number in the header comment as well.\n. Hi, we've included your Czech translation and fix for counter. However as you've noticed yourself we use crlf like newlines, so we couldn't merge your pull request directly. Thanks!\n. up.stop() stops everything for quite a while now...\n. Good idea. Especially for a buggy and sluggy Flash one.\n. Updates here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1064. I believe this has been fixed quite some time ago. Feel free to re-open if it's not true with latest commits.\n. This got fixed in latest UI Widget. And now there are two new options: browse_button_hover and button_browse_active. One could pass classNames to be assigned to browse_button on hover and on mouse down correspondingly.\n. Having option set similar to yours - yes, it won't. But you are right it's a bug, of a documentation at least. I'm working to fix this.\nYou could use - urlstream_upload: true, to force Flash runtime into the mode where it will send those headers.\n. Try latest one. It had flash related fixes. Let us know if you encounter that error again.\n. Flash: Removed blur filter for now. Closed by 7a25426c6f50f4065eaf17b5f3ac3d18a17269f5.\n. Other then that, does it play nicely with S3?\n. Could you possibly share your Plupload+S3 code? I really want to support this feature in best possible way, but I personally never used Plupload to upload to S3. Might give me some initial insight.\n. Thank you very much.\n. Ok, finally managed to look into this. Looks like Flash FileReference.upload() sets that Filename field (it happens in simpleUpload(), not in advancedUpload()). And turns out that problem is actually much deeper. On one hand we cannot override or disable that Filename field (FileReference will send it either way), on the other hand we cannot implicitly add that Filename field, since it's Flash specific, and may break other runtimes, which potentially can upload files to S3 too.\nI can think of two solutions, and, unfortunately, neither one seems to be universal. First is that one might use a special option: urlstream_upload: true (Flash-specific), which will force Flash runtime to use one method for all upload cases (advancedUpload() one) and that is not send that Filename field at all. Sounds great. But there's one drawback - it won't display progress, unless chunking is used (probably not an option in S3 case).\nSecond solution (which I like less) would be to add Filename field to the list of multipart_params and generate policy accordingly. On our side within simpleUpload we will have to check for duplicate Filename param and ignore it. Not sure if it worth it :(\nSo at the moment only first method will work as expected, without any additional manipulations.\nWhat do you think?\n. Updated S3 example to support a proper progress indication. Closed by 5d55b7b5834f6e3899904178d489c476ccaee43d.\n. @jnlin I know it has been a while ago, but do you know if this problem was even resolved in Gecko? Is there corresponding bug ticket filed somewhere?\n. Yes, that was an actual issue. But it's fixed now in the trunk.\n. Wow, I didn't know that you took part in it ;) Good work! Keep up poking us whenever you find it necessary. \n. Class selectors for Mouseover, Mousedown and such?\n. That probably won't be added to the Core API. Since it can easily be done without it, by using JavaScript libs (jQuery, Mootols, etc) or without them. Right now it's possible with Plupload jQuery and UI Widgets.\n. Doesn't sound like a very requested feature to put into the core. You can always add that or any other functionality on top of the basic Plupload, using events. We are working on providing more handy interfaces to access options and data dynamically.\n. While there is no doubt that our documentation needs improvement (and we are planning an update), but there should be no input element in plupload.File object. What is the event that gives you it?\n. What was the version of Pluplaod that you were using? If it's still an actual issue for you, you could try the latest html4 runtime js file right from github. Should be fine.\nWe are preparing a new release right now. It should be out today, or at most tomorrow.\n. Cannot repeat this on Windows 7 and Firefox 3.6.13. Perhaps Spocke fixed this already.\n. Hmm... no, actually cannot repeat it with older version as well. Do you still observe it?\n. Not re-produceable anymore, obviously got fixed.\n. Has been fixed recently: 334046faafd781b2e906\n. As replied in the same thread, the only solution would be to pass a session id with the file and restore it on the server side.\nIn Plupload 2 we've dropped BrowserPlus at once, since it has been abandoned by Yahoo quite some time ago.\n. Flash can't handle images bigger then 8191x8191. It's not a memory issue, but rather an inner constraint. We now handle this properly and trigger an error. Filter on image size is great idea. Need to think a bit how to add this.\n. I doubt we will ever put this into the core, but here's how you could try something like this yourself: max_img_resolution\n. Plupload now takes into account padding/border when sizing a shim (Flash/SilverLight) over browse_button, as suggested in #147. Closed by 1f0ab0a47e69916221a0ab5bd89760d30bec1733. Closed by 1f0ab0a47e69916221a0ab5bd89760d30bec1733.\n. We've seen a fork of Plupload recently, which claims to have a functional Java runtime implemented: http://github.com/jakobadam/plupload. Unfortunately we had no time to check it yet. But you can try it. We would be glad to hear of your results :)\n. Hmm... woa!.. Looks like it's indeed a Number now. Latest Flash Builder trial hints it to me as uint still though... Need to try it anyway...\nThanks for interesting suggestion.\n. Plupload now takes into account padding/border when sizing a shim (Flash/SilverLight) over browse_button, as suggested in #147. Closed by 1f0ab0a47e69916221a0ab5bd89760d30bec1733. Closed by 1f0ab0a47e69916221a0ab5bd89760d30bec1733.\n. I'm afraid this fix won't work, when there are multiple uploader instances on the same page (Plupload has support for this). But idea was very helpful. Thanks!\n. Prevent eventual reinitialization of flash/silverlight runtimes, especially for the cases when object wrapper needs to be programmatically hidden and then shown again. Closed by 51d63d685c45ba80d95399d35ad7e1ca0557c947, #80.\n. Ah yeah... sorry. This line right at the top confused me:\nvar initialized = false;\nI thought you were introducing global (to Plupload instancies) boolean flag there. And actually missed that you use this keyword later on in the code, obviously trying to alter it's value. But in fact keyword this in the context of \"Flash:Init\" event handler is basically an uploader instance and when you do this.initialized = true; you are not changing the variable initialized above, but rather setting the flag locally for the specified instance. That's why it works I guess.\nIf you look at the changes in our latest commit you will see that we basically do the same thing, but in more predictable manner.\n. Do you mean it gets rotated? That has been fixed for html5 runtime, we are testing ports for flash and silverlight at the moment.\n. Has been implemented in latest commit. You can destroy Plupload.uploader object by calling: uploader.destroy(). From all runtimes though only html5 reacts to a new Destroy event to a full scale, completely cleaning everything. UI Widget has public destroy method as well. All other runtimes are pretty clean and do not bind that many events to DOM elements as html5 did. Although handlers will come these days and it will be completely cleanable for the next official release.\n. Hi,\nWe would like to see that changed as well, I guess even more then you can imagine :) The problem is that for html4/html5 runtimes 'Add Files' button isn't really a button, but input element. Unfortunately cursor style isn't something that you can change for input element. At least that's how it is in modern browsers. Let's hope they or perhaps we, together with you guys, will come up with a better solution.\nThanks.\n. Ok, now here are the fixes in latest commits that may help you with mentioned issue in html4/html5 runtimes.\nFirstly, special class is added to the browse_button on hover. You can specify it through new option: browse_button_hover, or just use default - plupload-hover, which will be assigned automatically, if no browse_button_hover is found. This trick will work in all browsers. This hover class can be used to add some interactivity to browse button, like highlighting it or something. Unfortunately in FF and Opera that won't affect default cursor style. And it will still show up in text mode.\nSecondly, WebKit and IE are a bit more advanced in file dialog sense and let you trigger this dialog programmatically, so there is no need in having input[type=file] on top of browse_button. Therefore in these browsers we will not cover it anymore and cursor will be released.\n. Uploading and storing files using national characters is potentially problematic. At the very least there is no way to force download them from the script in cross browser way. Also additional precautions must be taken in the client code and on the server to make sure that they are actually uploaded and stored in expected way. But you right it should be up to user to decide whether it should be possible to upload files with national characters in their names or not. I will see what can be done. Maybe we will end up with another specialized option for this.\n. Hi Greg,\nI do not see why we shouldn't :)\nThanks.\n. Error messages are now translatable. Closed by 37801c7c7fdf686b051635bf6886496c4d7eca19.\n. Thank you for the tip ghost3k. That snippet will go into the next commit.\nI guess you are using plupload directly, without jQuery implementations?\n. Fix \"Chrome and fakeSafariDragDrop\". Closed by 0b1d8ce136139be87c291bfafea2a79441c567a0\n. Hi CJ,\nThis change was introduced to support re-usage of queue widgets for multiple uploads. But I agree it should have had some kind of conditional there. If you do not need that functionality (activated by multiple_queues option) then commenting out this line is totally fine. Otherwise something like the following may be better:\n\nif (settings.multiple_queues) {\n    updateList();\n}\n\nFixed this in my fork. I guess spocke will merge the changes when he manages to find spare minutes :)\nThank you for reporting this.\n. Added conditional for interface update in queue widgets. Fixed UI widget button icompatibility with jQuery UI 1.8.4+ css. Closed by d9fd92837517f0b4e2eb29c34533645da10e2343.\n. Have you tried uploader.splice()? It takes in two optional arguments: start and length, if you omit them they will be correspondingly set to 0 and the length of the files array. uploader.splice() will also trigger FilesRemoved and QueueChanged events and thus should trigger UI reset as well. \nLet us know if it does or does not ;)\n. uploader.removeFile() on it's turn basically does uploader.splice(idx, 1), where idx is the index of the file in array. You may end up with slightly cleaner code if you call splice directly :) But generally it's the same.\n. Added conditional for html5 runtime (and for html4 just in case :) Still getting my head around other runtimes.\n. Altering core files in order to fix problem specific to your case, is not exactly a good idea. You could bind a callback to corresponding dialog event and do a refresh of the interface - why not? Calling refresh is totally ok, that's what it was written for in first place.\nBut in your case, I think you just need to specify a container for Plupload instance, otherwise it will append it to the document.body and one may experience problems similar to yours. Have you specified a container element in Plupload initialization call?\n. As oyvindkinsey said, triggering file dialog programmatically in Flash is not possible, but we will support that hover effect in one way or another very soon. I'm going to commit the fix now, which is meant to resolve similar issue for html5 runtime on WebKit browsers. Flash fix will follow.\n. Yeah, that kinda sucks. Any idea how make the flash do a better job? Anyone?\n. Flash does much better job now, and we've updated it in recent commits to rise quality of resized images. This will be included in next minor release.\n. Can you please provide examples of the libraries and issues?\n. It's not that we are reluctant, just wanted to have an example of the problem. Actually I agree with you on this, as I do not see any benefit from such solution as well, always failed to ask Spocke why he had it there in first place. Ok, I think we will figure that out :)\n. Aborting the upload? Yes. if you do uploader.stop() it happens automatically.\n. Yes, but we can't at the moment - it requires major revise of the code.\n. Hi Jakob,\nIt's just that server-side is getting more complex, than average user can handle by himself. We were including upload.php into the bundle as example so far. If we merge in your great Java runtime we will have to rework upload.php and obviously bundle it as a part of Plupload, and not just mere example. But from such perspective (of client-server solution), Plupload, has some major inconsistencies, mostly because of our perception of it as a client-side only. While we also think that we need to push it further, for example chunking, but it obviously will require quite a revision.\nWhat you think?\n. Well... sorry for such delay. I'm in charge for Plupload now. I swear to come back timely from now and on :)\nActually I do not quite get what is problem with this. I've read the whole thread, but again... what was it? I should say that I actually own the Mac and do not observe such issues. Plupload has an option: multi_select=[true|false] and I believe it's on by default. I'm not yet familiar with Drupal Plupload module, could you help me out with kind of settings you use on there? Eager to help :)\n. Ah... that's actually not an issue with Plupload, but rather a general one of every old browser (3.0.19 is pretty old already you know :), since support for multiple file selection was introduced only in Firefox 3.6 (for Safari I think it was version 4). So...\nAnd yes, it's considered HTML5 feature, HTML4 had no multiple attribute on input[type=file] field, that's why HTML4 runtime doesn't have it either and won't have even if you upgrade to FF 3.6. Sad... but true.\nOk, I think this issue can be closed now :) \n. Closing a link in examples/upload.php before unlinking, as suggested in #172. Closed by 84be41af5fc8d9163ae1b91bb2088e15f1f3a621.\n. Cannot repeat this on Safari 5.0.3 Mac and Plupload UI Widget. Do you got this thing somewhere online?\n. Weird :) Will fix that asap.\n. Hmm... actually this bug shows up only on your site. Try an example here for example. Have you maybe modified your version?\n. Where you able to repeat the problem?\n. Yes, they are from the latest public release.\nBut there is another major release coming out these days. It will have some important bugfixes, so I would suggest you would use it instead.\n. Sorry, it took so long. Thanks :)\n. Yeah... input element acts very weirdly in that sense. Why on earth changing font-size on the button should affect it's dimensions?.. :)\n. I think, quick fix for this issue will be setting: overflow:hidden; on the input container. There should be a container for input[type=file] in every runtime. Will put that into the next commit.\nCan you confirm if this fixes a problem for you?\n. Make sure that input[type=file] element doesn't outgrow the boundaries of it's container in HTML4 runtime. Closed by 800effbed91305f91225d952edff40e9cf42fb2e.\n. Could you download plupload.html4.js right from github and try it? 'Cause there where some fixes about a similar issue. And then we can't repeat it here. We know that there were such issues in previous versions though, so your help would be much appreciated.\nWe are preparing new release these days.\n. These are methods for public Destroy (dynamic unload) feature. Yeah... you might need fresh plupload.js as well to bypass those errors. Sorry for inconvenience. We are wrapping up new release these days and things change quite fast.\n. Hmm... are you maybe manipulating list of files yourself, bypassing core removeFile, etc functions? I just having problem to imagine scenario, when such might happen. I will put a conditional around the n anyway - wouldn't harm.\n. I see. Ok. There should be a fix for that error in latest commit now anyway. So I will close this issue now (cleaning up a bit :)\nNew release is coming with bugfixes and some new features. \n. Great idea for specialized implementation.\n. In Plupload 2 we have both - image preview (even in IE6) and support for orientation tag.\n. input[type=file] element has a special attribute - accept, where one might provide comma-separated list of MIME types that file input field must accept. But unfortunately browsers do not support it as they should, so while we use that attribute, it can't guarantee that selection will be constrained. So Plupload checks if files correspond to specified filters, AFTER user selects them, and should let you know if you select wrong one, doesn't it?\nIf you need strict restriction on accepted file types at the time of selection, you should use either Flash or SilverLight runtimes.\n. Hm... oh. Great!\nI will add these now too. \nNice suggestion. Thanks :)\n. Wow, you are very quick too, but I already fixed that, so I'm quicker :P\n. Do you use m4a? If, yes could you describe in more detail your usage case?\n. It's just an example. Maybe we shouldn't have placed it there, 'cause I agree it might be confusing. But actually it has nothing to do with Plupload itself. User is free to do whatever validation he finds appropriate - after upload procedure, or before it; using internal Plupload events or events on the page.\nPlupload internally does validation only of file types and file sizes (in some runtimes), according to the filters that user specifies.\n. While there is a way to accomplish what you need, but you are right, it's not an easy or at least an obvious one.\nWhat is your usage case? What kind of validation you would like to use for example?\n. Will look into that. We could probably check the image formats ourselves, now that we got binary reader integrated.\n. In Plupload 2 we inspect files for being images, before assuming them to be such.\n. We probably won't be able to pull that in, at least that third party code, even if it has MIT license. But we find your suggestion potentially very handy. I think we will come up with some kind of a hook, were user will be able to interfere in with whatever external tool he finds appropriate. Will sit down to sort this one these days.\n. Not only as license issue. HTML5 runtime already has become pretty large and adding any more to it a specially having in mind the fact that it is still purely supported may at the very least confuse and scare off users. Providing a callback on the other hand, won't burden code any further and at the same time provide a way to use whatever third party tool user may find appropriate.\n. This has been resolved for Firefox 7: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=564388.\nNext major update will have direct access to file raw data, so anything will be possible. For current code tree unfortunately something like this is not possible :|\n. Actually it can be 100b as well, this will mean that anything other than mkg will be striped off and assumed to be just a number of bytes.\n. Can you provide the code that you are using to initialize Plupload?\n. I was able to get progress in IE 8/7/6 with your code (just cleaned it up of some undefined variables and functions). The only thing that caused a problem and made upload freeze in IEs, was:\nfunction onFileUploadProgress( uUploader, fFile ) {\n    console.info(\"onFileUploadProgress uUploader:\",uUploader,\" fFile:\",fFile,\" total:\",uUploader.total.uploaded,\" uploaded:\",uUploader.files.length);\n}\nProbably something left from debugging in FF/WebKit. Otherwise it seems pretty functional. \n. Could you describe your usage case in more detail? As I cannot repeat the problem in IE 8/7/6. Can we access it online?\n. Your code has multiple issues. For example this line:\n$('.thumb').html('Error: ' + err.code + ', Message: ' + err.message + (err.file ? ', File: ' + err.file.name : '');\nlacks parenthesis at the end.\nThen this one:\n    uploader.bind('FilesAdded', function(up, files) {\n       // to only have one file in the queue\n       if(files.length > 1) up.removeFile(files[0]);\n$.each(files, function(i, file) {\n       $('.thumb').html('');\n      up.start();\n      up.refresh(); // Reposition Flash/Silverlight\n   });\n});\nWhy would you need to call up.start(); for each file in the array? You could do that only once. Then when you do: up.removeFile(files[0]); I guess what you want to do is remove file from an actual queue, right? files array that is being passed to FilesAdded is not a reference to that queue, but a copy of just selected files. Instead you should operate on up.files array. So that a piece of code above might look like this:\n```\nuploader.bind('FilesAdded', function(up, files) {\n   // to only have one file in the queue\n    if(up.files.length > 1) up.removeFile(up.files[0]);\n up.start();\n up.refresh(); // Reposition Flash/Silverlight\n\n});\n```\nBut then again, I might be misinterpreting your intention. But one thing for sure, you do not need to call up.start(); multiple times.\nHowever :) due to your bug report I introduced some important fixes and updates. You could download the latest version from github and compile Flash component yourself (we use FlashDevelop with Flex SDK to do that), or I can compile it for you, upload on some public file sharing server and paste a link here. Whichever do you prefer :)\n. It will come out at the end of the week or in first days of the next one.\n. Be sure to call uploader.refresh(); when you show it, if you are displaying Plupload in a dialog or in any other dynamical way. Usually that is the only reason for such behavior.\n. Interesting. Do you know of any resource on this subject? For example when was that support first introduced?\n. fakeSafariDragDrop now only for Safari on Windows.\n. While you are right - e.preventDefault(); fits there better, as it is universal. But does it really open twice for you? It shouldn't. With \"return false;\"  or \"e.preventDefault();\", or without them. It was there basically for IE, 'cause often links are being used as browse buttons.\nBy the way, we use Windows style newlines.\n. Hmm... can't get that in canary. Anyway thanks for suggestion, I've put it in the latest commit.\n. Right... will incorporate that fix. It's just that we use Windows style newlines. Spocke is in charge :D\n. Hi, and thank you for suggestion. \nThat chunking size calculation thing has been a problem for a while. And you are right it was probably introduced after we turned off implicit scale thing. There was actually a reason why we did that, but I'm not sure, so need to discuss it with others.\nGreat work. Thank you.\n. Ok, pushed a commit to fix size not recalculating when chunking, but not resizing. However we probably won't enable that implicit scaling thing. Since Flash is quite sluggish on handling images and produces results of not the best quality (hence the necessity in blur filter), and then people usually do not like when something is done for them silently and buggy at the same time. Your a nice example of this, asking us to remove blur filter ;) We might introduce options for implicit \"scaling\" (compression) and blur filter, though. By now this case probably might be considered as closed :) Thanks.\n. Hers is another one: #194. We did small workaround, but it's really up to Apple to fix it properly :(\n. Interesting and weird... Of course we would want to know, thank you for reporting.\n. Wrote a workaround for this in latest commit:\n\"HTML5: Workaround Safari bug on Windows,when it would add only first file from the dragged set, but multiple times (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37957). So Plupload will just check for duplicate names and omit when encountered...\"\nOnce again we enter domain of browser incompatibilities and clumsy workarounds... :)\n. Any better suggestions appreciated.\n. This probably won't get into the core. Since it can be easily done within the implementation. Check this forum post for example: http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=373. Plupload UI Widget does have this already though, you could download the latest version from github. Plupload Queue Widget will be the next one to patch.\nWe will get a better documentation with the new website :)\n. Thank you for reporting. We will be updating examples and put a new Release these days.\n. I've not looked yet but symptomatically it seems that a path to flash object is wrong. Plupload will create and inject  tag, but it won't be functional in this case.\n. Yes please, could you give me your test account.\n. I noticed two inconsistencies in a way you initialize it. First one is that you have flash runtime mentioned twice in runtimes list (I know there was a same typo in one of the examples :) And the second one is that you include file for UI Widget (jquery.ui.plupload.js), but instantiating it as Queue Widget (jquery.plupload.queue.js). Apart from that I do not see any reasons why you might not get this functional in IE. Could you retry with those fixed?\nWe are working to improve documentation hugely. Sorry for inconvenience :)\n. There's nothing mentioned on themeswitchertool web-page, where did this news come from?\n. Hmm... yeah not a happy thing. Thanks for the info!\n. But actually cannot find any info regarding the themeswither itself. That's the only thing we \"hotlink\". Quote from their page:\n\"To put a Theme Switcher Widget on any page, simply add a script tag referencing our plugin and call themeswitcher(); on any element to which you'd like to append the widget.\"\nQuite weird if they really disable it as well, without putting an update on that page.\n. Thanks, we will add that. Although I guess you should know that there were some updates to the language pack.\n. Added Dutch language file. Closed by 999092f384fd7cf46d77a184376c6f1470e3b562.\n. Updated :)\n. Wow, how interesting... this line should have been ignored by FF4 as it is by FF3...\n. Fix conditional to properly recognise absense of XMLHttpRequest.sendAsBinary. Closed by 5f5b0c701875d70d6884db1091fabb0867d583d3.\n. Spocke tried it some time ago, but got something unstable and left it for a while. Have you tested on local web-server? In widget or directly with Plupload Core API.\nI tried it on 3+ gb file and it simply died out.\nI'm going to debug it more thoroughly though.\nThank you for suggestion!\n. Just testing some other things and then we are thinking to add support for chunk upload retry. So we will merge everything together eventually :)\n. We found it utterly not useful and not compatible with Plupload in general.\n. Shouldn't be a problem in Plupload 2.x.. I thought this one was fixed. Are you using the latest version (1.4.1)?\n. We've been fixing this by setting huge font-size in recent release. The only way I could think of. Suggestion appreciated.\n. file_get_contents has nothing to do with Chrome or Plupload. I think you need to dig deeper into your problem to ask something, we could respond to and help you with.\n. max_file_count is only available in UI Widget: http://www.plupload.com/example_jquery_ui.php. Is it what you are using?\n. Yes, but it will require direct manipulation on files array. Quite straightforward if you know what to do. But then might be a hard task if you never looked into Plupload source.\n. I mean \"Yes - possible\", but not \"Yes - possible with these options\", sorry if it confused you. You can't do that with options, you should bind to FilesAdded event and manipulate uploader.files array directly.\n. Yeah... :( completely buggy. Probably someone forgot to update the source on the website to reflect changes. Example from the bundle itself though is proper one.\nWe are working on better documentation and examples at the moment.\n. HTML4: moved UploadFile handler. Closed by 9791df914f918a2788d788e068c076713eda7241.\n. Actually Plupload has internationalization support built in. You can find samples under: src/javascript/i18n. You can use Dutch translation (nl.js) as it is most complete by this moment.\n. We would be glad to have additions to the bundle :)\n. Not sure I get it properly... what have you added to Flash version exactly? \nPlupload can be localized easily, as all the strings pass a translate function before appearing. One might switch it to his own language by loading a specified js file from src/javascript/i18n directory (check the extracted Plupload package for it), just like one would load any other js script, but you need to make sure that language file is included after core plupload js files. Some translations are already present, but not full (as we've added more strings in latest releases), but Dutch one is the most complete and can be used as a guide for other translations (one might replace Dutch strings with ones from his own language and that will basically be it).\n. I'm not sure how one might detect browser language in javascript (at least in browser independent way), do you? It's much easier, I think, to define on server, while constructing a page, with PHP or other language.\n. It has been fixed in the core and will get it's way into Plupload 1.5.\n. Fixed.\n. That conditional actually has a reason of being there. I will move UploadComplete to a different place anyway. Although I should say that file list update bug is still of widgets origin, and probably will be better to fix it from there, like make the widget trigger - rerendered event or something.\n. Did as ondrejhlavacek suggested. Seemed to be UI Widget specific only.\n. Queue Widget: Retain error messages on file item titles after list is updated. Closed by 0a075eb4c1e98eb81f7e1955d4c3a6b554e116dc.\n. If you can get an event of the content finally shown, just hook onto it and call uploader.refresh(); to re-render the plupload. Or set out a small timeout.\n. Are you actually setting a chunk size less then hundred bytes?..\n. Ah.. now I get you. Actually you probably want first chunk to be less then the rest... Hmm.. Yeah. That has sense. But let me ask couple of questions actually.\nWhat is the size you are usually using? \nAnd what apps are broken at the moment?\n. In Plupload 2 we provide access to raw file data, so the header can be checked on client-side. Otherwise I think such feature would have been too confusing.\n. This is possible in Plupload 2.x.. You could multiply chunk size by chunks number (gets passed to server-side script as well) and get a value which will be quite close to the actual size of the file. Will that do?\n. Queue plugin is being revised at the moment. So that will be fixed. As well as other inconsistencies.\n. Yes. That's on the list. May not make it to the next minor release (scheduled to end of this week). But it's coming :)\n. Yes... \n. Well... it kinda is, but repo is still private, due to some technical problems we experience right now. Hopefully it will se the light throughout July.\n. This seems to be a limitation of SilverLight itself. It just doesn't want to accept the comma. Try to replace with another character, or do not use it.\nSuggestions appreciated.\n. Does it affect only SilverLight?\n. What is the runtime you are experiencing problems with? Could you remove other runtimes form your runtimes list?\n. This is not a bug. Input elements are absolutely positioned. So that one needs to either use container option, or manually do uploader.refresh(); everytime plupload instance moves (for whatever reason).\n. Added support for . filter, as suggested in #227. Closed by 75e2fa8a7cfa152dc1a52f636cb5fa319ea7c4b8.\n. That\u2019s not exactly true, we do retain some important properties for EXIF and less for GPS, although it works only for HTML5 runtime at the moment. But codebase is prepared for Flash, and for next release will move onto the SilverLight as well. Other runtimes unfortunately do not have direct access to file raw binary source.\nWhat properties you would like to see retained after the resize, let\u2019s collaborate on this \n. Could you try to use HTML5 runtime just for tests sake then? And tell us if it does the job for you. Cause Flash/SilverLight will use exactly the same approach in next release.\n. I replied to a question like this on the forum, I guess it was yours.\n. Flash runtime now supports that too.\n. Added and organized by alphabet :)\n. Have you tried multipart_params?\n. Documentation is a bit outdated. Newer WebKits shouldn't have this problem. Have you actually tried? And if yes what happens not exactly as you expect?\n. I guess you could do that with Plupload events and custom scripting. There is no such functionality in the core.\n. 2 years, kinda old now. Feel free to re-open if it's still reproducable with the latest version.\n. Strange, no problem here. Actually I'm the one using it. Anyone experience similar problem?\n. It's - required_features: \"chunks\", not \"chunking\".\nBetter documentation comes with new website, which is under construction now.\n. Hmm... thanks for following this one to the end and actually fixing it :) Was tricky one indeed.\n. HTML5: Fixed inconsistency in naming of chunks feature. Closed by 1b7b07477996005dafafad2892648d5d7e687061.\n. Actually one could pass all this additional info through multipart_params option.\n. upload.php is really just an example. User is meant to change it if he/she needs it. But thanks for suggestion, although sys_get_temp_dir seems to be available in php >= 5.2.1.\n. HTML5: Make mimeType detection case-insensitive, as suggested in #238. Closed by: ae2c84b89b59aab1eb73be302778435964203b84 \n. If you are using widgets, just set multiple_queues option to true in your configuration object.\n. You can find previous version in downloads section on github.\n. Has been fixed. Release is out now.\n. In my test case, file for some reason doesn't reach the server...? Haven't had time to look into this more deeply.\n. This has been resolved eventually. Firefox (and others) will now use FormData when possible.\n. Flash component, which is used to upload files in your case, obviously gets out of sight. Arrange your html structure so that it doesn't get hidden, covered by any other html element or positioned outside the viewport. That's Flash technology constrain. Also try to make use of container option.\n. This has been adressed in latest release. One might state quality only, leaving out width and/or height and Plupload will drop  quality/size accordingly. Like this:\n...\nresize: { quality: 70 },\n...\n. This has been fixed. I will release minor update today or tomorrow. Still need to merge some changes.\n. Awesome.\nHave you tested this with multiple ICC_Profile segments?\n. I merged it, but then I decided to reorganize and unify the whole thing (to support other APP headers, like IPTC for example), so lot's of things changed hugely.\nI would like to test it now with an image having multiple ICC segments, could you please share one?\n. Great, thanks. Looks like new version works as well :)\n. Unfortunately input[type=file] doesn't allow full control over cursor styling. That's browser \"issue\". But we've addressed this, in several commits while ago and it is now a part of official release. Where possible it will improve the situation with either arrow cursor or the fully controllable one.\n. I commented out on pull request. Could you test with latest release, if the issue is still there? It shouldn't be.\n. This is related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/785. As in the case with rename option new file name is sent as separate param and handled by our upload.php. Obviously in the case of S3 there is nothing on Amazon Side to handle custom params, so one basically has to set it manually in the config. . It doesn't read width and height from JFIF actually. There was a bug in current public release, which wasn't taking into account offsets bigger then 64K. That resulted in width/height not being detected sometimes. But that has been fixed quite some time ago. Do you have example of typical problematic image?\n. @gourneau, Can you describe a situation when something like inspecting zip contents might get handy? How do you see it working?\n@tommedema, not sure what you mean.\n. Why do you think it can be cheap inspecting 1 gig+ zip on client side?.. \n. Plupload 2 now does provide access to raw binary data, as well as native selected files (html5). We have not added any zip inspection code though. I think it is beyond Plupload competence. But now it can be implemented as a third party plugin.\nI still do not think that this is good idea though. Probably only in html5, since flash requires to load the whole file in memory, before it lets you to check binary source. Obviously not useful.\n. I will close this now - trying to clean up the tracker a bit. Feel free to comment further though if you got any additional suggestions.\n. Are you talking about WPlupload (WordPress plugin)?\n. Ok. You say you \"have an error while uploading some files, rather large in size\" and then say that they are \"only about 70kb\", so are they large or small?\nIn general it sounds like your server-side runs out of memory.\n. Try to enlarge memory_limit option either in your php.ini or through wordpress and see if it helps. It should be generic error, you probably will get the same error with standard uploader (try to disable WPlupload and upload again).\n. I will close this as duplicate of #257.\n. Required features are documented here.\n. Have you compiled one from github or are you referencing 1.4.2 release version?\n. Tested it here in various modes, FileUploaded is definitely there. Can you share you configuration?\n. Might be caused by mixture of various scripts and/or cache. Could try 1.5.3 that we've released recently on a clean cache and tell if it's still causing troubles?\n. I do not have Ubuntu here, but it worked on Fedora. Will try to install and test.\n. Hmm... do you know if this is specific to Chrome 10 only? Interesting, is it documented somewhere, or have you found this out by mere experimenting?\n. Thanks for information, quite insightful :) Having those headers stripped off is of course safer. But all image related apps on my mac, are able to extract Exif data properly, even with that extra Exif block in there somewhere. What's the program that causes you trouble?\n. When you are using container option, flash object is appended to it instead of the document.body. It is usually not a problem at all, unless your container is set to disappear or be moved off the screen. Flash/SilverLight components stop working in such cases and re-initialize themselves. That's what might be happening in your case. Do you get this error. When modalbox is shown, refresh is called on Plupload and you do not hide or move the modalbox during the upload?\n. It is quite a strange error to get in the middle of upload... Are you able to upload that big files using other runtimes (HTML5, Flash for example)?\n. Are you maybe hiding Plupload in the middle of upload, like covering it with some other container or minimizing the dialog?\n. Was never able to reproduce this. Sorry. And now Plupload 2 is a complete rewrite.\n. There was a bug in UI Widget, it was actually meant to change the actual order not visual. But it has been corrected a while ago. It works cross-runtime, so you can take pattern from there for your usage case.\n. Have you filed this in regards to WPlupload?\nActually whether 11 files is normal or not depends on your WordPress installation. In case it uses lots of thumbnails of various sizes, then it's - possible. Unfortunately I can't tell you more without knowing more details. Are all 11 files - proper images?\n. simpleUpload was meant to use Flash's default upload method - FileReference.upload (some people like it more then the other) - it is the only one supporting upload progress indication. advancedUpload is our artificial implementation of upload logic, currently it is able to report progress only when chunking is enabled. But if you have chunking enabled then simpleUpload won't be used anyway, so...\n. If you do not want to use chunking you can force Plupload into \"advancedUpload\" mode with urlstream_upload : true\n. I'd recommend to upgrade to Plupload 2.\n. What is the version of Plupload you are experiencing this error on?\n. New version doesn't use BlobBuilder.\n. @cotko, can you post an example of code that causes problem?\n. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.\nIn my test windows machine ignored the name completely, while mac only removed accents... hm... is it what you observe?\n. Does bundled custom.html example show the same problem when you try it?\n. @downquark yes. After the panel is displayed, call uploader.refresh() and the shim will get repositioned properly..  think this has been now auto-fixed, once we got support for all kind of slice methods in (prefixed, non prefixed, deprecated).\n. Well... no. Suggestions?\n. Probably :| Although since it's just the way Flash works we thought it'd be obvious...\n. Actually it is not possible to upload without loading everything in memory either way :| Let me know if you've know or heard somewhere that something has changed about this...\n. Hmm... last time I checked it was loading everything in memory even with FileReference.upload(). Where were you checking this?\n. @jakobadam, wow... speechless...\nJust tested in Chrome and FF and looks like you are right... memory meter rises just a few mbs. Whatta?... I definitely tested this a while ago and it was loading everything in memory. Hm...\n. @hcwebdev, what do you mean when you say: \"FileReference::upload does load the file into memory, but it immediately starts transferring the data to the url supplied.\"?\nHow does it manifest itself that it \"loads the file into memory\"?\n. Ok so that was nice lesson of - not be so sure that you know something for sure... :D\nCrap.\n. Plupload now automatically turns chunking on and off, when it is requested to absolutely upload the file of certain size. We allow chunking in Flash only if size is less than 200 mb.\n. build.xml comes with dev version only, you can download it from githib: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/downloads.\n. We won't be adding any such feature, but in current stable release it is possible to manipulate a file (or even separate chunks) just before the upload in any desirable way and then feed the resulting blob back to uploader.. FilesAdded always returns files that were selected. You can access actual files in the queue through uploader.files (uploader object is the first argument passed to every Plupload event).\n. Never observed anything near to what you described. Any special steps to replicate?\n. mozdirectory doesn't seem to affect Firefox in any way, so I didn't add this. If you guys have any updated info on this topic, please share.\n. Hm... looks like the file input marked as webikitdirectory cannot select files anymore? Doesn't feel like a handy option? How you guys imagine this in Plupload actually?\nRemoved from Plupload, but left in moxie's FileInput.\n. The problem for this and similar cases is that Flash object cannot be hidden or covered with anything since this causes it to fail or reinitialize. Let it have higher zIndex than the overlay and it will work.. Have you succeeded with altering other runtimes?\n. Full response is now passed to FileUploaded handler (in text format though).\n. You can pass file id with file upload as one of the multipart_params options. Check documentation, it is poor, but this one is covered for sure.\n. File size is not available in HTML4.\n. sendAsBinary and \"hack\" for WebKit (I wouldn't call it a hack, since it basically does the same thing as sendAsBinary) are now used only to send resized images, or overcome specific bugs on Gecko, when chunking is enabled. The latest commit tries to address all those issues.\n. IOError usually triggers for the wrong upload url. Anyway, Plupload 2 now returns proper and consistent error messages and response statuses, as well as the whole server response in textual form.\n. Do you guys still get png related error with github version of html5 runtime? I remember this is has been fixed a while ago...\n. Also consider putting Plupload element into a wrapper element and pass the latter's unique id as container option, this way browse button and Plupload itself along with shims will be wrapped into a single element, and thus will \"follow\" browse button.\n. Confirmed.\nAlthough not sure what can be causing it :| Plupload doesn't depend on scroll event anyhow. Might be some kind of Flash + Safari + Windows environment artifact. Can't repeat on Mac.\n. Safari on Windows is oh so buggy.\n. Fix is now in the trunk, so will get in official release eventually these days.\n. S3 uses different format for chunk upload, so you have to push it through the server anyway I guess. What you mention is not a \"bug\", but a \"feature\" to fake progress even with smaller files. Not ideal and we probably will replace this with something else.\n. Duplicate of #305.\n. Can be really handy, strange how we haven't thought of it.\n. That hack let's us to resize images on Chrome before uploading. But you're right we could restrict it's usage to a specific case only.\n. Ok, this has been resolved by now I think. In general it's a hack to a same extent as sendAsBinary itself, so opinions split here. We now use it only when required.\n. Might be helpful if you'd mention what runtime gets selected in your case. But yes, this is expected \"bug\" on big files, when chunking not enabled. If big files are your concern then try some chunking and HTML5, SilverLight runtimes, or Flash runtime only with chunking disabled.\nBut first wait for 1.5 release, which is already coming.\n. Will get that fixed today guys. Sorry for big delay :|\n. sendAsBinary hack has been added to support image resizing as there were problems with this at that time on Chrome.\n. Took into account all suggestions from the thread... feel free to criticize and suggest if you got a better idea.\n. @atoomkern I will adress your issue shortly, it seems to have a bit different nature though.\n. Ok, quick patch didn't work and that part obviously requires a rewrite... :|\n. Update will come on this weekend. Big problem is that File API continues to mutate incompatibly in all browsers. Fix for one browser gets another to it's knees. And then these features cannot be reliably sniffed, since some of them contain bugs, that might be fixed in coming browser releases. \nLooking for good compromise...\n. You should not be using html5 runtime if you are looking for reliability across browsers.\n. sendAsBinary hack has been removed, but the concept that was being used by it is not a hack, it's actual functionality that is meant to be leveraged.\nNew commit 4893d2f has been landed, which tries to take into account all possibilities. You are welcome to try it out.\n. Strange. Not sure about Lion, but I have tested this on Safari 5.1 (6534.50) Snow Leopard. Have you purged the cache and everything?\n. Are you having problems with this latest fix? In my tests it works no matter single or multiple.\n. @atoomkern, with the last fix?\n. Safari is not able to resize yet, so that doesn't matter. Does it work properly in Chrome for example? Do you in fact have your usage case online somewhere?\n. I will check Safari for Windows today.\n. I'm preparing it today, so let's hope it will make it.\n. Sorry, missed the point here.\n. Strange. Can't repeat this. Looks like there were some problems on some Flash Player versions. Do you still observe the problem with IE9 and the latest Flash Player?\n. @fruitbatinshades can you try swfobject as suggested above?\n. Yes, use it instead of plupload.flash.js. Do not forget to include swfobject.\n. Ok, better late than never. I'll be implementing this feature for Plupload 2. However your implementation seems to have several flaws. One thing is that it will only check current file selection session, so that if a file with the same name was added to the queue in previous session, adding a duplicate in the next will still be possible... Another point is that file selection is not that sensitive operation to care about performance, which shouldn't be that noticeable even for a queue with hundreds of thousands of files. We can run the check directly on the queue I think. This way you won't have to care about synchronisation between the hash of selected files and the queue (files from which might get easily added and removed).\n. It is possible to re-upload the same file with different options, although none of the widgets support this, so one will have to code the logic manually. Prefix for file name, or file name itself can be passed with the file through multipart_params option, but as you might guess should be handled on server-side, which we do not do. But you can.\nThumbnails probably wouldn't make it to the current branch, since code base is not well suited for such manipulations. A branch for next major release has it, but it's still under heavy optimization, testing :|\n. Cropping is now supported in Plupload 2. Can be used like this:\njavascript\n...\n// Resize images on clientside if we can\nresize : {\n    width : 200, \n    height : 200, \n    quality : 90,\n    crop: true // crop to exact dimensions\n},\n...\nAlso check updated UI Widget example from Plupload 2 beta nightly.\n. Great idea, but too lengthy for this case I think. What do you think? We are considering something like this for major update though, so thanks for great suggestion anyway :)\n. One could simply use en.js as a language pack with direct mappings between original strings and customized ones, I guess.\n. Create empty container with unique id and pass this id as container option to Plupload configuration. Should solve your problem\n. By default Flash and Silverlight are limited to GET/POST. More sophisticated methods require socket connections and special facilities on server side. Not within Plupload competency I guess...\n. Closing this as duplicate of: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/102.. Try: mutipart_params option.\n. We cannot control that, because User-Agent is listed under restricted headers, which means that they cannot be changed from within Silverlight.. Can you post your config? In some cases it is expected behavior, in other cases it might one of the Flash bugs.\n. Try to supply absolute paths to Flash/SilverLight shims.\n. Can you go in a bit more detail on this?\n. Is it only IE9 affected, does Chrome for example behave the same. Try to remove html5 from the list of runtime to take a clean test.\n. Tested with:\nWindows 7 + IE 9.0.8.x (32-bit) + Flash Player 10.3.x\nWindows 7 + IE 9.0.8.x (64-bit) + Flash Player 10.3.x\nLoad is almost instantaneous. Can this be an environment? There was a report that Plupload Flash runtime doesn't load properly when there is another flash object on the page. Do you got any in your case?\n. I can't repeat it. \nI'm thinking to add support for swfobject (kinda when it's available use it instead if native method) - it is being said to load plupload without a problem,  @fruitbatinshades have you tried? Take a look at this: #323\n. Oops.\n. @gabor, why would you want to support Firefox 3.6 (not that we are against it, just would like to know your opinion)?\nI guess it fails for you because you are using your own custom upload handler, which probably has support for multipart only?\n. Try this commit: c3fc43c. I brought back old and ugly way to do things for legacy browsers only. You're right we shouldn't break backward compatibility. \n. Mime types for avi, wmv now added to the core. Thanks. Although we do not observer flv, mpg problem in Chrome as of 13.0.782.112. Do you still?\n. Couldn't find any viable mime type for webfont files, except for otf (application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.formula-template worked).\n. Yes, that was the side intention behind the whole thing and it's coming to Plupload 2 at full scale. But I think we could easily make it available on current version as well. Hold on.\n. There are now two new events triggered: ExifData and GpsData. One can attach event listeners to either of them and check the third argument (second one will be file object), which will be an object holding corresponding data.\nFunctionality available only on HTML5/Flash runtimes at the moment.\n. By calling sendBinaryBlob(nativeFile) directly we are trying to leverage the power of File.prototype.slice, which makes it possible to send file in chunks without preloading it in memory. While still buggy in some browsers, still more convenient for big files.\nBut you are right there was conditional bug. In general every other browser has it's own hickups now and then and here and there. That's why conditional tree is so ugly :| Suggestions appreciated.\n. @jacobwg woa...\n. @jacobwg sorry, for expressing it in a wrong way maybe. Didn't mean anything bad, was a bit of surprise for me. I knew there were some plans for a while, but didn't know that it has been included into the trunk already.\n. This has been fixed in latest commits.\n. This has been fixed through another pull request. Thanks for taking part in this though ;)\n. When not using resize or chunking Flash runtime falls back to it's default FileReference.upload() method, which is more convenient way to upload big and huge files (doesn't require file to be read in memory). In case you would like to retain consistency across the runtimes, are using custom headers and do not upload huge files, you can force Flash runtime into compatible mode by setting: urlstream_upload option to true.\nThis is not a bug, although I agree, it's kinda quirky. Any suggestions on how to improve the situation around this, are welcome.\n. Yes, right. We do this for resize and chunking, but custom headers fell out of our view :|\n. Do not see it in Safari 5.1 (6534.50) on Mac. I could probably disable multiple file selection for Safari on Windows... \nSniffing... who said we could do without it?..\n. Hmm... you have a point :)\n. Alas, Safari doesn't have it's own bugtracker.\n. Btw, as I've exposed multi_selection feature, you could use required_features option to fall back to Flash or SilverLight if user comes in with Safari on Windows. HTML5 has got some very powerful upgrades recently to ignore it just because of one buggy browser :|\n. Please more details on the failure, cause it's not a case on wide scale.\n. Seems like 5.1.7 doesn't have this issue anymore. Anyone to confirm?\n. I guess now that Apple has dropped Safari for Windows (quite a while ago already), we gotta close this one.. File dialog cannot be programmatically triggered on some browsers, specifically old ones (not IE6), that are still wide spread around the web. In fact until recently it was supported only on WebKit. But you are right we got to recapitulate our feature detection logic to support new browsers that already have it.\n. Hm... good suggestion, thanks. Neat idea for older browsers I guess... Although it doesn't seem to solve the main problem on new ones (complete control over the cursor style). Does it show pointer cursor for you in FF6? It's arrow for me here on Mac.\n. Included in b0c095c.\n. Can't repeat this. Maybe you got a form within another form (browser-wide error) or you are triggering file dialog programmatically (not supported on IE)?\n. Something specific to your implementation probably. I will close this now, since I do not observe such behavior in any of the tests.\n. @mohit-rocks what you describe is not related to the issue in this thread.\n. By latest version you mean 1.4.3.2, available from plupload.com? Or the one here on github?\n. We've put out version 1.5b on plupload.com, try it out.\n. I believe this is sorted out then?\n. Resolved in b0c095c\n. If you double click Open New Tab button in Chrome, how many tabs you will get?..\n. Ok, but if seriously, how would you neutralize such behavior in html4/5 environment? \n. Hm... a good suggestion actually..\n. When browse_button is clicked Plupload generates Browse event, that can be used to disable browse_button (among other things) via uploader.disableBrowse().. Plupload 2 now has this built in and even uses alternative ways of showing thumbs, when neither canvas, nor dataURI are supported. Client-side thumbs in IE6. Yikes! You can try it out from here: http://www.plupload.com/download.php.\n. Hmm... good suggestion... \nBut what about other headers: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest.headers.aspx? Maybe some quick fix for them as well?..\n. time to switch to SilverLight 4 you think?\n. Woa... how could I miss your bug report :| Did just that and some more in ie9_flash branch. Would you mind to check if it works for you?\n. Does it happen when your are removing the file that is being uploaded?\n. I've addressed #313 with the latest commit. What about setFileFilters and removeFile?\n. Simply wrap Plupload element in container and pass it's id as container option.\n. Additional safety surely won't harm, but what was the case when you got this?\n. When custom implementing Plupload you should consider wrapping browse_button element in a container and pass it's id as container options to Plupload conf.\n. Do you have your usage case online, or can you paste your code here? We do not usually encounter anything similar.\n. I do not see you passing container id in configuration object. Do you say that something like this doesn't resolve the problem?\n\n    $(function()\n    {\n        var uploader = new plupload.Uploader(\n        {\n            runtimes : 'flash',\n            browse_button : 'add-to-queue',\n            container: 'button-container', // notice this one\n            chunk_size : '10mb',\n            url : '/upload.php',\n            flash_swf_url : '/_scripts/plupload/plupload.flash.swf',\n            silverlight_xap_url : '/_scripts/plupload/plupload.silverlight.xap'\n        });\n\n        uploader.init();\n    });\n\n. Mechanical typo. Sorry guys :| Fixed here: 0396f06\n. You mean you cannot parse JSON response in html4?\n. @ClemensSahs , are you getting this error across the browsers, or in specific one?\n@kristokiis can you supply an example of problematic JSON string?\n. I think ClemensSahs was meaning that when he passes html in json, he doesn't get full response. @kristokiis are you saying that you get html, when you do not pass it?\nAgain can you provide an example? 'cause in our tests we get plain, fully parsable json.\n. @ClemensSahs, @kristokiis provide examples of problematic strings please.\n. I've been testing this in Chrome and never encountered  case, can you reference an example?\n. Intention behind this was to support different response formats. Are you using bundled upload.php?\n. What is the header you send along with json - application/json or text/html? Maybe tryout to comment it out if you set something implicitly.\n. Hmmm... yes... it seems that that's the reason for the problem. Although not sure how to deal with this just yet..\nAs a quick fix, you could get rid of pre wrapping by overriding the header with text/html somehow. \n. Just send JSON response as text/html from the server. No other solution at the moment unfortunately.\n. Plupload 2 handles this internally.\n. To my knowing Opera cannot upload files just yet. @ClemensSahs has anything changed? Any link to a resource?\n. It can select multiple files. It's different. Check if it can upload files.\n. nativ version?\n. You can't trigger it with JavaScript. It's security measure within Flash/SilverLight. In case you find it otherwise, feel free to share with us :)\n. For next release we will be converting Plupload to SilverLight 4 and I will look into this deeper. Any info might help. Thanks :)\n. @deslooverej  is it? Should be not.\n. To my knowing flash object intercepts click, so that you never get it in JavaScript, and thus cannot pass it further.\n. Are you using the latest Plupload release?\n. Plupload 2 accepts DOM elements directly for browse_button, drop_element and container. You could get hold of the element by it's CSS selector using native browser or JS framework methods and pass them in.\n. We do not throw any dialog, is it something from your implementation?\n. alert() is blocking, thy console.info instead..  I do not observe anything like that neither in XP nor in Windows 7 :|\n@doxavore, if you change it back to 99px does it make the bug go away in your case? It was made to ensure that input element effectively outsizes it's container (in some cases it was not occupying button space).\n. Are you having the same problem with the latest version of Plupload?\n. Try to clear browser cache. It definitely has been fixed.\n. filename=\"blob\" is expected behavior, why do you think it is lost? This should be happening only when you have chunking enabled, so every chunk will be sent this way. The problem with Geckos prior to 7 was that they were sending empty string in filename (like filename=\"\"), which caused some servers to not interpret this properly, but filename=\"blob\" is ok. You shouldn't have any problems with this. If you have some, then maybe describe your usage case in a bit more detail.\n. Chromium 12.0 should not be having any problems at all, so - yes, something odd happens. Please provide more details - config, your code, your expectations.\n. @chrisuae name in $_REQUEST, or name in $_FILES?..\n. Chrome 12, Chrome 14... I'm using Chrome 15... who said IE is nightmare?\n. I'm afraid there is no way around this. I wish there was, but there's none. In case you manage to find one, let us know. We are open to suggestions.\nSetting filename as blob when sending chunks is actually current W3C recommendation. There's a plan to make it possible to pass filename as third parameter. But I've not seen any support for this in current browsers. By now you should not rely on $_FILES[...][name]. Use $_REQUEST['name'].\n. In your case I see that you got unique_names option set to true. That's why you get those cryptic filenames in $_REQUEST['name']. (I guess that's what you intended, right?). If for some reason you still require original filename you can pass it as one of the multipart_params yourself, let's say add it on BeforeUpload event.\n. Blob (+ some  gibberish) is a normal thing if you are awaiting filename from $_FILES['file']['name'], that's why we send original file name with every chunk in $_REQUEST['name'].\n. We have to sniff them... I do not see any other solution. This is exactly the case when feature detection tends to get more clumsy and clunky then sniffing... \n. I'm afraid there is no other way to upload large files in Firefox 3.6 anyway :|\n. Hm... never encountered anything like this. Parent container in our tests always has position:absolute...\nPlease can you change your style only to width/height 1px and/or font-size 1px instead 999px?\nHow does this help to solve this issue?\n. If it's about sending JSON for server, send it with text/json header instead of application/json, which is not supported on older browsers and consequently by our html4 runtime.. Do you also use Flash Player 11?\n. One thing you could also try when something like this occurs, complete uninstall of your current Flash Player (http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html) and reinstall from fresh.\n. Are you using the latest version? Cause this has been addressed a while ago, by explicitly lowercasing all extensions. \n. Can't repeat this :| What version of Plupload are you using?\n. Everything about the code is going to change soon. And it is being modularized among other things, so you can consider your suggestion addressed ;)\n. If we remove the check for up.state == plupload.STOPPED we won't be able to stop the upload process if stop procedure was requested in the middle of chunked upload. It is not always possible to abort the upload immediately, but we tried to release it as soon as possible, so once the chunk that is being uploaded at the moment of the stop request is indeed uploaded, we are able to stop there.\n. With abort functionality in place, we can unambiguously stop uploading right there. So you can be sure that the rest of the file will not be uploaded.\nFor comparably big chunks, like around at least 1mb we could probably remove the whole conditional. But for smaller ones (~100kb) you can hit and miss the middle state. And if you miss, chunk will trigger onload event and invoke UploadNextChunk, which will proceed uploading, without knowing that state is STOPPED, or file artificially marked as FAILED. So we need that conditional there.\n. By now you've probably upgraded Firefox. Did the problem go away?\n. Currently not possible in Flash/SilverLight.\n. Wow... :) Do you know that Flash Player officially supports upload or download only of up to 100 MB?.. It's probably bigger then that now (although they still have this number in their docs for FileReference), but you get the idea. In our tests Flash is not the best tool for uploading files over 2 GB.\nIf you got ideas of how to make Flash compatible with big files, suggestions are welcome.\n. With chunking enabled it is in fact worse, Flash doesn't allow direct access to files, so chunking in Flash is possible only after reading the whole file in memory...  so, if your goal is about uploading huge files, I'd suggest that you remove Flash from runtime list.\n. Sorry, had serious problems, and was out from the net for a while. I will get this addressed asap.\n. You are adding your lightbox trigger dynamically. Majority of lightbox plugins do not monitor DOM for dynamic additions, they only initialize once - on load. But they should contain some code for manual re-initialization of arbitrary element into lightbox trigger.\nThis is not Plupload issue, so I will close this now.\n. UI Widget was meant to be a solution out of the box and not a piece of code ready to be extended :| But you could always get hold of the core uploader object (http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=2226#p2226) and bind listeners to any events.\nMay I ask you what were you trying to do exactly with BeforUpload and other events?\n. Ok, I'm back now. Expect fixes to this and other things.\n. Hm... first of all I tried to completely disable Exif extraction logic and still was able to repeat a random freeze problem, so it should be something else.\nAnother thing I noticed that sometimes file dialog doesn't let to select multiple files despite of the enabled multiple selection feature. Also on random.\n. Now this might sound funny, but once I've installed debug version of the player, I'm not able to repeat the freeze problem anymore... Can anyone try as well?\n. @japentaca, @Denozawr could you also try debug version of the player? I used uninstaller to ensure that versions do not interfere or something.\n. I've temporarily uploaded recompiled plupload.flash.swf here, until I address other issues. Be sure to try it out. After the change I wasn't able to reproduce random freeze problem anymore.\n. Thanks for taking time to test this, it was irrational issue :)\n. @prpghandi, thanks I will check.\n. @prpghandi so far, cannot repeat it. I will put additional checks where you've pointed out anyway. Have you tried to purge the cache before loading the modified swf?\nUpdate: Ok, after investigating your jpeg files in more detail I know see that they contain ExifVersion field in non standard form. Were those images post-processed by some app, or is it how they came out of your camera?\n. @prpghandi, I've updated compiled swf, with a fix, check it out (your proposition was taken into account :).\n. Try setting this option in your conf: multiple_queues: true.\n. You can. But the problem is that Flash for example doesn't return HTTP status text, code is all you have there.\n. Too cumbersome in current reincarnation of Plupload. But major rewrite (which comes this month) brings along consistency across runtimes.\n. Line 89 of plupload.html5.js has:\njpegHeaders = new JPEG_Headers(atob(data.substring(data.indexOf('base64,') + 7)));\nThe only line containing file.fileName is line 234, however it has been fixed for a while:\nfiles.push(new plupload.File(id, file.fileName || file.name, file.fileSize || file.size)); // fileName / fileSize depricated/code>\nAre you maybe referencing some other file?\n. Duplicate of #421. Also check that thread for fixed swf (until we have a minor release fixing this problem).\n. You do not have to write version for every runtime. Interface is unified, that's the whole point ;) You can check our widgets as a way to follow.\n. It has something to do with visibility. In fact you should have this problem in all browsers, not only IE. It is expected behavior. Try to call uploader.refresh(); after you swith to the tab with Plupload.\n. The problem here is a bit deeper then that. In addition to handlers defined in UI widget, there is also a core handler for FilesAdded, which triggers QueueChanged event before the UI widget's FilesAdded handler is even called. So that by the moment file list should already be populated. The problem is caused by the fact that QueueChanged in the core is detached from the flow and triggered with a delay of 1ms, which is sometimes just enough to screw the event order and the whole thing. \nBut thank you for bringing this to our attention, your investigation made me realize the root of the problem :)\n. Just wrap it in a div and give container id to it. That will do.\n. It is not possible to send custom headers in Html4 runtime, is it? Suggestions appreciated.\n. Hmm... yes, I guess we should add the line about it in features table. Basically html4 does support nothing :( Only upload without page refresh.\n. Only XHR Level 2 is able to upload files, which is currently supported only by webkit and gecko. To answer your question - no, html4 doesn't use XHR, since there's no point in this :)\nI've updated feature table to reflect the not support fact.\n. Why is it a problem to clear the queue, every time you need to clear a queue?\n. It went out earlier today. You can download it either from Download section here on github or from official site: http://plupload.com/\n. Do you have your usage case available online somewhere? I mean I would like to see how the problem manifests itself.\n. @nickvergessen, hm... I guess I will remove those throttlers, the reason why we had them there is not relevant anymore anyway. Thanks for this illustrative usage case.\n. Addressed it in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/5eaff3c61ebed45e31a1dbb92d6dfd32cb678e81 (will be included in 2.1.2).\n@tiff, marked you as an author, better late than never ;)\n. You could bind to native DOM dragenter, dragover, drop etc. events. No?\n. Hi Manu. Pleasant to see such enthusiasm on your part ;) although have some questions. Wouldn't a necessity to send data to be modified and already modified back and forth, neutralize all the benefits from using WebWorkers? Have you done something like this before?\n. The idea of whole resize thing is that rather then doing a resize on server, you do it on client-side, therefore - upload faster and consume less bandwidth. If we do it with WebWorkers, we will have to - first, send image data to WebWorker to be resized, and - second, send resized data from WebWorker into the main thread to get it uploaded. What I question here is, if this process has any benefit to what we do - now :) \nDo you have answer?\n. Yes, that one :) No, I've not tried. Do you think you can come up with example?\n. This is strange. As far as you are using 'success_action_status' => '201' (and I see in the code, that you are) and do not use chunking, you should not have any freeze problem at the end of the file. So far couldn't repeat freeze problem in monitored environment, although seemingly had one freeze in the beginning, before I switched on the sniffer.\nDoes it happen to you consistently across browsers, systems and workstations?\n. How big are the files that you upload?\n. 23 mb is a quite small file. Never heard RequestTimeout happening to something less then couple of gbs. Hm...\nI will try some more.\n. We are going to do a bugfix release today. Be sure to try it out.\n. Not able to publish on the site at the moment, some technical obstacles. Will do that tomorrow. But you can download it from Downloads section, here on github. \nLet us know of results :)\n. Thanks for testing it out and coming back with feedback. We are preparing a release for next major version of Plupload now, which is going to support checksum calculation and retry logic for chunked uploads. And is going to be much more compatible with Amazon S3 and other kind of CDNs.\n. Thanks for letting us know about the progress on this. \nI'm afraid the only mode we do have control over (for Flash) is the urlstream mode. Another one is default one and is completely locked (no access to raw file data, no custom headers - the only thing you could do if you fail in non urlstream mode is retry the whole file).\nFor coming version we build up on top of urlstream mode. I'm experimenting now to get the progress on it.\n. So you have excluded all possible local factors?\n. html5 runtime is not yet supported in Opera. If it is the only runtime in your list, then widget will not work. \n. Ok. I will take your suggestion into account :)\n. Damn... i better do a release :(\n. Calling stop before destroying indeed didn't result in expected immediate abort before. Now this has been fixed.\n. Do these mime formats work across all platforms?\n. I think we need to push this a bit further. I did it recently for all other runtimes. Imagine that chunk is big enough, like 10mb or something, then when you request cancel upload, it will still wait until that current chunk is uploaded. We'd better provide a possibility for aborting it right there. Can you suggest a fix for this? :)\n. Does this work for you? In my tests it not only doesn't stop the upload when chunking is disabled, but throws an IO Error when it is :|\n. Chunking requires special care on server-side. Are you using bundled upload.php?\n. Chunking requires special care on server-side. Check bundled upload.php for example.\n. We've been thinking to include support for this. So probably will get into next release.\n. Does your server-side upload handler return anything, like DONE or 1, or something? Does it work with HTML4 or SilverLight runtimes?\nIt works here in all IEs, so it should be something specific to your environment.\n. I mean it should return something after it ends, like print out DONE and check if it solves your problem with Flash.\n. Does the trouble happen when you deal with IIS?\n. Well... not sure how they do it in SWFUpload. Are you sure they do? Maybe you are testing Plupload and SWFUpload with different Flash Player versions? Only some versions are known to be susceptible to this bug. \nTalking about the bug itself (not related to Plupload), it is a quite known one, annoying to the extent that Amazon for example decided to arrange a special response mode for it's S3 to overcome it (check it out here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HTTPPOSTFlash.html).\nWe are open to any suggestions :)\n. Actually default upload method was revived later, 'cause users actively asked for it and then despite of all goodies URLStream upload requires whole file to be read in memory first. So we have two upload methods for Flash now, but with big files it's better to use default Flash uploader. We do store loaded bytes and we could probably compare them to total size and fire artificial complete event, when there is no response from server.\nAnyway thanks for bringing this up. I will have a good thinking about it.\n. Why does it return 302 for some files and doesn't for others? Or it returns it for all of them?\n. Flash understands only 200 and 404 - that's technology limitation.. In Plupload 2 we've now removed the whole fakeSafariDragDrop thing.\n. Should be fixed in a081f64eebee47ca9a87d35448da92006c39f07e.\n. Basically you have to put this in a separate js file (for example) and include it after Plupload core and widget js files.\n. In Plupload 2, we now have uploader.addFile() method.\n. Both Firefox and Chrome (and even Edge) now support drag-and-drop of folders - all files inside will be automatically added to the queue.. Does it work for other runtimes? Have you tried?\n. Why can't you? I can. \nProvide more details please.\n. Shouldn't be relevant for Plupload 2.x I guess?. This is expected, since when using resize parameter, Plupload switches itself into our self-constructed upload method, which has some important benefits over default method. You can always force Plupload into that mode by setting: urlstream_upload: true.\n. Can't repeat. Maybe it is specific to your configuration... can you post it?\n. Can't reproduce it with the latest build (you can always find in downloads section).\n. Might be something specific to your scenario. Could you provide more details? Plupload conf, etc?\n. @felixchan does it work in other browsers?\n. Works ok here in IE 7,8,9 and Chrome...\n. You cannot have Flash shim in invisible element, even more, you can't have Flash shim in an element that is covered with another element! Flash prohibits that (security measure). That's why it happened.\nOn the other side we definitely have to prefix all the classes that we add to the DOM elements... :|\n. Could you try the version over here please: https://github.com/downloads/moxiecode/plupload/plupload.flash.swf?\n. That swf is incremental compilation, so that it includes all the latest changes. I will be pushing minor bugfix this week.\n. @diegofcam, are you sure you purged the cache after you tried that swf?\n. @amazeika always having at least 4 chunks was meant to be a feature. Sorry if it is confusing. Does it makes you trouble?\nSo are you saying that even with the swf provided above you still experience the freeze? Then why you thought at some point that it resolved it?\n. Can you provide the code you are using please? Especially the conf.\n. Sorry guys, wasn't available, kinda dived completely in pushing out next major release (ground-up rewrite of Plupload and it's core). \nI looked into the problem now and it looks deeper then Plupload, something related to how latest Flash player in Chrome treats URLStream. I got a might be workaround, but it would be great if you guys were able to find some time and test it out in your own scenarios. You can check it out here: https://github.com/downloads/moxiecode/plupload/plupload.flash.swf.\n. Thank you for taking your time on this!\n. I don't remember any such problem in FIrefox 10. Also in Firefox 11 it just works.\n. As of the latest commit I do not observe such issue. Do you still experience it?\n. Try the latest - 1.5.4.\n. Never experienced anything like this. Unless you are talking about modal js-generated windows within one browser window. If that's the case then this is in nature of Flash/SilverLight technologies. Object must be visible and shouldn't be covered by anything else, otherwise they automatically get disabled (security measure).\n. html4 doesn't have facilities to differentiate between server errors, it triggers positive if server outputs something to it. Anything.\n. Next major update to Plupload is going to be much more consistent and hopefully will standartize error messages.\n. Actually there are some events that you could bind to in a way like that, these are: selected, removed, progress, uploaded, complete, start, stop, error. Pretty many of them, just no init. I could probably add this too. What do you think might be useful as well?\n. There's a ready event now (for quite some time), that is fired when uploader is initialized and - ready.\nAlso I should have mentioned probably this by now, but those widgets have started as examples of Core API (which is the real - Plupload code base). So basically anyone can implement their own widget in any framework. That was the intention ;). I will look into this.\n. That Error event is fired for every file that doesn't pass specified filters, so that one could throw notification or log it for example. Can you guys describe a case when this might be a problem?\n@dkpeymb adding of the filtered files twice is an obvious problem, need to address it somehow.\n. CancelUpload makes sure that all connections are closed and resources disposed. Maybe you should hide container on StateChanged event (while checking that uploader.state is equal to plupload.STOPPED).\n. Cannot repeat this with jQuery 1.7.1. Might be something specific to your case.\n. Flash component should be visible, if it gets out of view it reinitializes itself. But we could probably handle it more gracefully in future release.\n. Ehm... no, we had no such plans. Have you had any progress on this? :)\n. We have the code for this in Plupload 2 now, but it is functional only in Chrome 21+, so not really usable anyway.\n. Works in my tests. What's the browser?\n. Is there a serious reason for this to be in the core? After all you could always get a response from server in FileUploaded handler and process it in a way you require. No?\n. We do not bind to any specific response format, JSON-RPC is only an example. Although great suggestion for people looking for how to handle errors passed back in JSON-RPC response. That could be a nice example page in our wiki, here on github. But obviously not merging this one into the core.\n. IE10 doesn't support XHR Level 2 just yet (at least it didn't, do you know if something has changed?)\n. That's nice! I'll see were I can push it further.\n. Ok, I managed to finally get it installed. And Plupload HTML5 just worked. Even resize works out of the box. So...? Maybe you could retry with the latest Windows 8 build? \n. It doesn't depend on HTML5 runtime only, your server (to which you are planning to do a cross-domain upload), should be properly prepared as well.\n. There is nothing in the code that may constrain it, so it should be something else...\n. Yep. I will get something like this into a release this week.\n. Can't repeat. Might be something specific to your scenario.\n. Has been adresed by: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/5538f383d7c20cb3893a48cd8d765120cef9f977. @siesqo what bug to be specific? When sending multipart, you can send arrays and objects.\n. In Plupload 2.x arrays, objects - flat or nested are supported. So, you can consider it fixed I guess.\n. Has been addressed in 4d4fc2f.\n. This is solved in Plupload 2.\n. Everything is namespaced in the second major version of Plupload, which finally comes out this month.\n. First public beta should be out by the end of this week.\n. It's out for quite some time. You can download it from here.\n. Having hard time imagining scenario when something like this might occur... :|\n. There was a similar issue in one of previous Chromes. Good to know that the've eventually fixed it.\n. By directly assigning new value to uploader.files you in fact are pointing it to another object. You can't change original this way. Try to alter it rather then point in other direction.\nArray.prototype.splice.apply(uploader.files, queue);\n. Not that it's incorrect, but.... check my response on #520.\n. Consistency is being addressed in upcoming major update. \n. Getting the text from the request not possible though, as far as I remember Flash for example provides only status code. So it's code or can also be a standard text if map supplied, like: 405 Method Not Allowed.\n. In Plupload 2 we now return status code, status text and actual response (in text format). But exotic headers are still not guaranteed across runtimes, for example they will definitely fail for html4 runtime on legacy IE browsers (see #585), so I wouldn't recommend it anyway. Maybe reply with JSON and parse it on client side.\n. Why multipart false? So Chrome does it right?\n. Addressed in 611b179afdba70b5d8a477babb24aea702e24d46.\n. You can always remove filter option from configuration or use *. I'm afraid simply skipping it will be even more confusing.\n. It's how browsers implement this feature, so in theory this the only way to go... Don't you think?\n. Yes, but it never made into 1.x branch. Plupload 2 however appends unknown extensions to the accepted list for browsers that support it.\n. I'd recommend to upgrade to Plupload 2.\n. It's because Flash and SilverLight runtimes do not currently set status field :|\n. No, not only in Opera. It's just that Chrome and Firefox usually pickup HTML5 runtime, which sets status field properly. You are right about documentation though...\n. Thanks. Merged them in.\n. I'm afraid pluploadQueue is not meant to be extended this way. But you could always patch it for your own uses.\n. This has been addressed in Plupload 2. We make sure that container has enough height/width for Flash to initialize.\n. You can do this by hooking onto FilesAdded event before you call uploader.init() and do any kind of additional filtering from there, be it name check, size control, etc.\n. It has something to have with the Linux that you are using. I never encountered or heard of anyone having the same issue :| But it could be that it's because everybody has switched to html5 these days. I will find an opportunity to check it somewhere.\n. I was never able to reproduce this. Also we probably do not have any control over that. So, I will close this one.. It crashes or there is no response after 100%? Kinda not the same thing.\n. Flash requires that sometimes. So if you output something simple it won't harm.\n. Are you sure it's html5 too? So far there were no such cases. Try flash first and see if the problem goes away.\n. Your code seems to be ok. It should be something specific to your case. Do you have it online, where we can test it?\n. Couldn't repeat it so far. Sorry I missed your last response, if you still need a hand, feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. You are using chunking, so I might assume that you are not uploading it directly to S3, and that in general S3 is unrelated to your problem. I would suggest that you narrow your problem a bit further.  Are you sending chunks to server that does upload? \n. Depends on your PC I guess. But yes that's the exact problem. And it's even worse when you realize that Flash has it backwards - it can upload any size, but only if you do not have chunking enabled. Specifics of the runtimes, not Plupload. Suggestions appreciated.\n. I can't repeat this now, either it happend before we changed something, or maybe I'm failing to replicate the conditions for this.\nYou are welcome to reopen this ticket with more details.\n. @arnaudncy\nI have try with png image and works fine.\nWhat you mean?\n. 1) Silverlight used to upload files in chunks, so basically progress was reported only after the chunk got uploaded. That's the reason for jumpy behavior. Smaller chunk_size could result in smoother experience.\n2) Flash requires some output from server to detect the completion.\nBoth issues were addressed in Plupload 2.\n. Should be fixed by now. \nAlso Flash is not good for uploading files over 2gb, unless you disable chunking. But then you might get out of memory error in Silverlight and HTML5. So I would recommend removing Flash from the list of runtimes for big files :| Sad but true. In Plupload 2 we got a workaround for this, that disables or enables chunking depending on the runtime capabilities.\n. Plupload lacked mime type for pdf in it's internal mime/extension map. We've added it since then.\n. We removed this in Plupload 2. It was quite confusing for almost everyone.\n. Thanks for the effort. However in Plupload 2 we removed that silent chunking piece. Since it really was confusing. Also runtime exceptions are now gracefully translated into Exception event in Flash itself. \n. You cannot know for sure what the size of the image will be after resize, before you actually resize. Suggestions are welcome.\n. Plupload 2 doesn't have this problem anymore.\n. This is Silverlight shortcoming, it just breaks if you pass in the title with the comma. Not sure how to fight this. Suggestions are welcome. \nBut I would simply avoid using comma in the title.\n. We have a Getting Started page here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Getting-Started. We did not mean delay to be that big and then you cannot specify 0.5 in sleep(). And more importantly it is only an example, so anyone is free to customize it to ones needs.\n. XMLHttpRequest doesn't trigger any error in such case and I believe so does Flash's FileReference. So probably not possible to detect. Ideas are welcome.\n. This might be relevant: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/594#issuecomment-323582533.. Not sure what you mean. UI Widget us meant to be used together with UI themes. So filelist takes whatever is default text color in the current theme. If you are trying to customize it to your taste, you become the one expected to match the colors.\nYou can try UI Widget with a theme switcher on the Plupload site.\n. Closing this, however fixes and pull requests are still welcome.. Would be interesting to see if this one is still a problem.. It can be arranged in html5, but no - not even possible in Flash, mostly because all you have in Flash is GET and POST and I think you require PUT to upload chunks to S3.\n. Handled properly now in Plupload 2.\n. Good idea! Never realized the fact actually. Thanks!\n. Flash doesn't send cookies by default - it is a known issue. One  has to initialize Plupload with required_features requesting capability to send_browser_cookies explicitly. Flash then will be switched to another mode which can send cookies (however it loses feedback progress, however that's whole separate story).. There is uploader.disableBrowse() method, which accepts single boolean argument, either true (default) to disable control, or false to enable it back.\n. Fixed in Plupload 2.\n. This has been addressed in Plupload 2. The reason for this was that progress events were fired related to original size, while actual size after resize was obviously much smaller. We interpolate the values now to report adequately to the actual situation.\n. I will add these. Are there any other fields do you think might be useful?\n. @sujen29, I've included image description tag. Getting user comment would require too much additional code, basically doesn't worth it right now. Maybe if it gets enough user requests, I will include it too.\n. I don't think it is a good idea to simulate original click event. But we could probably dispatch something like - BrowseClicked (past tense should denote the fact that you can't really prevent it, it will happen anyway).\n. Plupload 2 (and up) has Browse event.. Ehm... not sure what you mean, actually it does accept decimal values, actually decimals are the only values it does accept...\nI will close this one now. Feel free to re-open if I misinterpreted this request.\n. Actually looking at the context more throughly now I think that what you suggest is not related, especially to the issue that you've referenced. File name and parameters are sent to the server as multipart/form-data and therefore are not meant to be url-encoded. Maybe you should revise the server logic instead. I'm going to revert that commit now. But thanks anyway - it has brought me to another issue that I'm going to investigate now.\n. Ehm... no. We do not cache anything, so this should be something coming from Flash directly. But interesting observation, thanks for reporting it.\n. You cannot hide Flash/SilverLight component - it is limitation of these technologies. They stop working if you do. You can use conveniency method uploader.disableBrowse(true/false) instead to temporarily disable browse button.\n. I guess this is not relevant anymore.. I see in a network sniffer that file is sent to the server chunk by chunk, but response is weird. Maybe you should check how you handle it on server. Also try to disable chunking.\n. \"Access Denied\" might be triggered in several cases: 1) If domain of parent frame and child iframe do not match; 2) If ports do not match; 3) If protocols do not match.\nCase 1) might be happening even if you are sure that domains are the same, for example, when request failed and server sent back a response different from 200. In such case iframe might get redirected to res://ieframe.dll/http_500.htm loaded from local disk.\n. Plupload 2 handles this properly now.\n. When \"Access Denied\" is detected we will default to 404.\n. Can you repeat it in 1.5.5, or version 2 beta?\n. @gpierrick what Plupload version?\n. Are you experiencing this error with flash runtime as well? Share your config please.\n. Cannot repeat it here, using fresh 1.5.5 from Plupload site and your config. The only three options I've altered are paths to swf/xap and upload url. Does the file upload at all in the second case?\n. Might be faulty upload url, IOError gets triggered when upload fails for some reason. It might be wrong url, breaking session on remote side (default upload method in Flash doesn't play nice with cookies), etc. Resize option indeed alters upload mode from default to our artificial one (as well as chunking or custom headers). You can force Plupload into the artificial mode by adding: urlstream_upload: true to the conf.\n. Checking if those are indeed files that are being dragged is interesting. Will bear this in mind.\n. It is incorporated in Plupload 2.\nRegarding this code here, it is good, but still has some flaws. So that we cannot merge it directly. But more importantly the code for our html5 runtime in 1.x branch is already quite big and hard to follow. We decided to not extend it any further. So, only bugfixes. Plupload 2 will get all new features.\n. It is in main branch already. The latest binaries are always available at moxie repo, ubder bin/ folder.\n. Dropped folders are recursively checked for files that fulfill filter requirements and files that fit are added. That's it. How you planned to use relativePath or where did you expect it to appear?\n. Makes sense. Also shouldn't require too much coding to add I guess, I'll check...\n. After some thinking I came to a conclusion that it is more confusing than useful, mainly because it is not supported across browsers. Not sure why you would want to rely on something like that?\n. relativePath is now being retrieved where supported and can be accessed on the File object.\n@tsmgeek , @mscheper we do not rely on length property and check the folders recursively. Can you check the code here: FileDrop.\nSince this has been implemented. I'll close this one.\n. This surely is an inconsistency, but I'm not sure whether we should \"correct\" html5 runtime or flash... Content-Type: application/octet-stream is sent when file is chunked. Obviously this is more suitable content type for chunk of arbitrary data, rather then specific one, like - image/photoshop.\nWhat do you think? Btw, how do you expect to use that Content-type on the server-side?\n. @john-dev, in what version of Safari you get that problem?\n. Yes, chunking doesn't work in Safari 5.x, but it should be able to upload the file anyway. @laimu does it in your case, or it fails?\n. @john-dev it might be that your server has a limit on file size that you can upload (by default it is set to 2mb I think), so when you use chunks (in Chrome and Firefox), file manages to make it's way to the destination folder piece by piece (not exceeding the limit that is). But Safari 5.x is not able to slice the file to chunks and upload fails. You can force chunking in Safari 5.x by explicitly asking Plupload to choose a runtime with chunking support, like this:\njavascript\n...\nruntimes: 'html5,flash,silverlight',\nbrowse_button: 'uploader',\ncontainer: 'container',\nrequired_features: 'chunks' // <- this line is crucial\n...\n. This has been included.\n. What you describe is expected behavior. If you are using one of our widgets, try to add multiple_queues: true to your plupload configuration.\n\nmultiple_queues:\nBoolean state if you should be able to upload multiple times or not.\n\n. #2038 errors tend to happen when connection slows down. Slower the connection, higher the chance for the error. Haven't seen any solution to this. Seems to be a deep bug in Flash itself.\n. Amazon specifically mentions 201 Created problem with Flash and provides a workaround: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HTTPPOSTFlash.html.\n\nSome versions of the Adobe Flash Player do not properly handle HTTP responses that have an empty body. To configure POST to return a response that does not have an empty body, set success_action_status to 201. Amazon S3 will then return an XML document with a 201 status code.\n\n. @sickill does it go from 0 to 100% immediately for any file size, even noticeably large ones?\n. Trying to address this problem somehow, I've stumbled upon such experience somewhere on the web:\nIt's interesting!!!!\nMy issue was that when the first file was uploaded I tried to upload the second one (listening for the COMPLETE event), but this raised the #2038 error.\nThe feeling I have is that when the COMPLETE event is dispatched, the upload process is not really 100% completed and so it raise this error according to the documention you reported (two upload at the same time)\nThe workaround I found is to place a timer (300-400ms) at the end of each upload so I'm 100% sure that the previous upload process is completed.\nMaybe it's not the best solution but it works smoothly.\nAnyway if you found some other ways to fix thi issue, pleas share it!!!!\nRegards!!!\nI'm going to try this, but since I cannot repeat this anymore, I need the help of someone still experiencing the problem. Anyone? Or it has gone with FP and browser updates?\n. Try Plupload 2, we have a nice Upload to Amazon S3 guide here as well.\n. Closing as duplicate of #594.. Check https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/682#issuecomment-12321058 for instructions to how extend internal map with new mime types.\n. What's the point?\n. Plupload 2 has more consistent error handling now. Although html4 runtime in some cases will not be able to differentiate between error codes, especially on IEs and will simply report them as 404.\n. As soon as I've set some positive z-index-es it started to work. Maybe we should get rid of that negative logic.\n. I guess not relevant anymore?. Why do you think it is incorrect for other runtimes? By using a single backslash you are simply escaping the second quote, which IS incorrect. Using double backslash is actually a recommended format for a case like this.\n. Tnx :)\n. It is possible now in Plupload 2, but in slightly different way. Maybe check the references above to get the idea.\n. Have you tried to put Plupload structure (browse_button) into a container and passing it's id as a value for container option? It is meant to be used to solve such and similar issues.\n. Yes I checked. This problem is easily solved by putting browse_button and Plupload structure into the same container, by passing container's id as a value for container option in Plupload configuration. In Plupload 2 we even try to it do it automatically, where possible.\n. What is the point we are missing?\n. It might be possible to slice off the chunk, preload it with FIleReader and send as binary. I had something similar for Gecko 2,5,6, which had a similar problem with FormData and Blobs.\n. Addressed this in Plupload 2 code base. Actually this should be easy to backport to 1.x branch as well, as the code for workaround is already present there.\n. Stable Plupload 2 is going to come out this week (at least scheduled). Actually it was backported to 1.5.6. Maybe you are affected by a different bug? Post your config please.\n. Ouch... overdue by 5 months. Crap. Need to push it out ASAP.\n. Behavior that you describe only happens when Plupload is appended directly to the document.body. Simply put browse_button element into the wrapper and pass it's id as a value for container option.\nIn Plupload 2 we put Plupload structure into the browse_button's parent element, if container is not specified.\n. @tasoss If you are checking it from browser console, you won't see any calls, as they are made by Flash and not the browser. Also 1.x branch explicitly requires at least some response from server, otherwise FileUploaded might not be called (depends on Flash Player version). In Plupload 2 we've addressed this problem.\n@marcterhorst does your server-side return a response? Some output like: { \"OK\": 1 } or DONE. At least something.\n. This is not a bug, it's just how we sanitize file name in example upload.php, around the line 38:\n// Clean the fileName for security reasons\n$fileName = preg_replace('/[^\\w\\._]+/', '_', $fileName);\nYou can customize upload.php to your needs.\n. Raw file data is now available in Plupload 2 and not only through HTML5, but in Flash and Silverlight as well.\n. Ok, so here we are, after a last deep dive for Plupload 2. And I also got an iPad at last, so let me come up with some solution here finally.\n. This has been fixed. For 1.x branch here: 48c110ee1299db24a0b4cf7400d247e342bc7aff. And Plupload 2 was free of this bug from the start.\n. Originally it affected all Safaries, although the only one to fix was Safari on Windows. So what you've experienced was a fix, rather than a bug. Just too broad - shouldn't have affected mobile Safari :)\n. Well you could use latest js source from 1x branch or try Plupload 2. Bugfix release for 1.x branch is not yet released, scheduled for Monday.\n. I tried Plupload 2 with the same results.\nWhat kind of same results?\n@NightmaresWithin you can use unique_names option to avoid overwriting on the server-side. iOS doesn't provide any hint on what the file name should be. Although we might probably auto append numeric suffix to the name for iOS only. I will consider that.\n. Wow, did we have ExifData event..? Would need to bring that back I guess. Otherwise seems to work in current Plupload implementation. \nhttp://play.plupload.com/4__J_/1. Currently we have a filter that prevents duplicates. A way to constrain number of files in the queue is available in UI widget, however it can be easily ported to the Core API, since the API for creating custom file filters is exposed.. I guess it's not relevant anymore, especially because accept attribute now allows filtering directly by extensions (filtering by mime-types was absolute absurd anyway).. Sometimes it is not possible to return response headers and content for HTTP error, for example Flash in default mode completely ignores them. But anyway, in Plupload 2 we do bundle all response headers within the info object for FileUploaded, ChunkUploaded and Error events, where available.\n. Quite a serious effort here... Andrew, what is a typical usage case for this (similar request #610)?\nIn our Plupload 2 rewrite (or better to say in it's lowlevel core, as I still have to add support for array of selectors to Plupload itself) we can have as many drop zones as one might require (check an example in wiki). Code base for 1.x branch, and especially for html5 runtime has become a bit over-bloated. Not sure if we should expand it any further. Already hard to comprehend :) What do you think?\n. Ok going to close this one now.\n. @mehran20 were you able to upload the file the old way after you enlarged upload_max_filesize? Check my response in #589.\n@Velmont in general upload.php is just an example. You can enhance it in any way you find appropriate. However we do not plan to expand it any further. Opposite in fact - I'm looking to cut it down :)\n. @jewel, I do not see how the fork you mention fixes squish bug, does it? \n. Something similar is already in the core, although not yet in any build. But will be these days.\n. Should have been a className conflict probably. However doesn't seem to be a case in current version of Bootstrap Button JS and UI Widget for Plupload 2 beta.\nDo you guys still experience it?\n. Works for me here, although I see a broken styling here too. Obviously there is conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap - they both define Button extension on jQuery. In case you are not using Bootstraps button functionality you can resolve this conflict simply by loading jQuery UI script/style files after Bootstrap ones.\n. Hm... this doesn't look as an elegant solution to the problem... Anyway we take this into account in Plupload 2.\n. I'm going to merge this in. However header(\"Content-Type: application/json\"); will have to be removed, as MaxKorz said it's problematic in old IEs.\nOne could probably play with Accept header, to get predictive behavior. However one important point here - upload.php is really just an example, you are free to alter it however you like or completely replace it with your own. Doesn't have to be so complex in most cases anyway.\n. Do you have it online somewhere? I've heard about this bug, but never encountered myself and can't think of possible reason immediately.\n. You can use multipart_params option (key/value hash).\n. Can you provide a typical problematic example image?\n. In what scenario you would want to use this? This might be an interesting feature, but easily too complicated to worth the effort. \n. Plupload 2.x and up support custom filters. I guess that's the way to go.. What kind of small file it is? Can you provide it as example?\n. You simply need to allow jpeg as file extension in your filters option, like this:\n\n...\nfilters : [\n            {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,jpeg,gif,png\"}, // notice jpeg in the list\n            {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip\"}\n],\n...\n\n. @derhecht which firefox version do you have, what platform?\n. Finally fixed in a6e725ac88ac0eeb85cf726ffd4ac369e31d6558. Tnx :)\n. jpeg files are already compressed and some times with a quality around 60. If you later \"resize\" the same image with quality value that is larger (like 90), file size will increase. Sad, but true. If you are aware of any consistent way of detecting image's current quality, to make it possible to constrain quality identifier to a specific max value for example, please let us know :)\n. There's nothing to leak, unless you are using urlstream_upload: true and trying to upload huge file, like 2gb+.\n. Are you using our bundled upload.php, or you got your own self-written upload handler? Basically resulting file, when chunking feature is enabled, has to be \"manually\" constructed out of the separate chunks on server-side.\n. It probably has something to do with Operas way of slicing the files. I will check.\n. No... uploads fine for me - Opera 12.11 on Mac. Although I've detected another strange thing - FileReader.readAsDataURL returns an empty string for images when resize is activated... :/ @Wodomon can you confirm?  \nHere is quick jsFiddle with isolated case: http://jsfiddle.net/HehZG/1/\n. Have you checked jsFiddle? It should basically output file contents in the console. For me it is just an empty string.\n. Yes, it uploads fine for me on Mac. Seems to be Opera + platform specific bug.\n. input[type=\"file\"]'s accept attribute requires special care for every other new mime type :| Quite inconvenient. If you could provide proper mime types for problematic extensions, we could add that.\n. Yes I agree, it is misleading. Mainly because we use that code as an example in upload.php. But the truth is that Plupload doesn't really take into account JSON RPC or any other kind of error code artificially sent from server. It just passes it through. But you can intercept it in FileUploaded and hook up any appropriate logic.\n. Plupload 2 supports drag'n'drop-ing directories in Chrome, files will be filtered according to filters option.\nAbility to select directory however requires separate browse button, since for unknown reason same browse button cannot select files at the same time. So it's either folders or files. Not exactly useful, imho.\nRelated #289.\n. You are getting \"Security error (Error #2048)\" on random on the same implementation where other pictures succeed?\nHave you tried latest stable release?\n. In Plupload 2 we now have added a new option max_retries, which by default is set to 0 (do not retry). You can set it to bigger number and Plupload will retry upload of the failed chunk that many times, before reporting it failed. We've also got rid of numbering chunks and started to use actual offset, so that chunk will not be simply appended to the partial temp file, but will be written at an exact offset inside it.\nAny better suggestions are welcome  :|\n. In fact quite lot has changed. Do you know what runtime is handling that troubled upload? You could launch developer tools for example and locate dialog trigger (has some fancy ids and is prefixed with runtime name).\nI'm adding log code to the dev source, that will make debugging more intuitive.\n. Hm.. looks like omission on our part. Have you tried to set: responseType = 'json'?\n. This has been addressed now: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/b26387464c7c527b8da94d5f77dad61f46bd1ab5\n. I've updated Plupload 2 package with recent fixes: http://plupload.com/download.php\n. Tnx :)\n. I've updated Plupload 2 package with recent fixes: http://plupload.com/download.php\n. It is quite problematic to support this across the runtimes, hence the queueing. But maybe - yes, it can be supported where it can be supported, just as other fancy features.\nUsing it in node.js is interesting. Are you using it as part of some module? Are there any other features you would like to have?\n. HTML4 in Plupload 2 creates unique iframe for every file, so that might be something that you will like.  In fact simultaneous uploads was something that I wanted to implement right from the start, but there are obvious complexities to this, but yes we can simply constrain it to HTML5, HTML4.\n. Do you know what technique they use? I just doubt that one that we could use might be performant enough to worth the implementation.\n. Yeah. Unfortunately those links that you provide describe default upload method, that lets you select multiple files, but does not let you upload them simultaneously. Internally we use another method (there is also a third one, but it doesn't worth the effort), which gives you almost all the power, but requires you to have all the files preloaded in memory. To my knowing there is no workaround this and this has been a source for utter complaints for years already. Having files in memory is obviously suitable only for small or medium sized files, preloading time for which easily compares to upload time itself. So benefit could be quite negligible. It's nice to have this anyway and I will probably go for it, although not exactly universal solution.\nThat russian programmer has nice code base there btw and partially does very similar thing to what we have here. But we tried to follow W3C specs. Interesting. We also pass data from JS to our shims and vice-versa, for example to display client-side thumbs in browsers that do not have canvas and dataURI support. But that's not usable for uploads (only in rare cases when there's no other solution) - too slow or better to say compares to the upload time itself.\n. Simultaneous upload of files and chunks is now possible in Plupload 3.x. I'm preparing bugfix release now.. Can you provide the list of runtimes that you are using in your conf?\n. I'd recommend to upgrade to Plupload 2.\n. Linux desktops were affected by this bug a while ago.\n. I don't think we can affect this in any way.. Has been added now. Thanks :)\n. This image has very strange GPS offset tag that points outside the available boundaries. Are these modified in any way, or just original images taken with iPhone?\n. Fixed in 3f61fadcb4b314632c6e922e180a1cad22a1ad60. Try this nightly build: http://plupload.com/downloads/plupload.flash.swf\n. I definitely can. Maybe you get the error alert because of the size and not the file type. Notice: max_file_size : '10mb'. For smaller zips, it works makes through without a problem.\n. This has been fixed. Are you still experiencing it in the latest nighlty build?\n. HTML5 should fail in IE9, that's ok. The problem is why it doesn't fallback to other runtimes... Hm.\n. Try to re-download Plupload 2 beta package, I've updated nightly. It handles IE9 properly.\n. It definitely works for me in Safari 6.0.2 on Mac OS X. What are the runtimes that you use? Are you sure you have html5 in the runtime list, I think I forgot to include it in that example.\n. I'm testing against 2.0a Beta. Does it throw any error in Web Inspector?\nI've updated nighlty today. Can you test against it?\n. Still do not have access to that platform to do anything meaningful to it.. In Plupload 2.x and up files that do not meet requirements are filtered out, be it single file or multiple.. The problem with missing parameter has been fixed (here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/672) and nightly was updated. In case you encounter something different, can you please describe it in more details?\n. Closing this for now.\n. Typo :| Fixed and updated nightly. Thanks!\n. Nightly updated. Thanks for taking part in our beta testing!\n. Thanks for reporting though. We are moving to a different kind of language pack management, similar to what we have for TinyMCE, so in future releases such errors will get impossible.\n. Language packs were normalized now.\n. File name is sent separately as multipart parameter. You can combine it with the original one sent with the file. This way you have both - what the file name was and what it became.\nYou can send additional multipart params with every file through the multipart_params option, which is a simple hash of key/value pairs:\n...\nmultipart_params: {\n    param1: \"value1\",\n    param2: \"value2\"\n}\n...\n. Do you mean ColdFusion doesn't accept our multipart parameters? And what did you mean when you said Content-Description is wrong?\n. I'm not competent in ColdFusion unfortunately, but if you could provide a multipart format that ColdFusion can understand I will be able to make required changes I think. Although we've followed wide-spread standards, so not sure why this might be happening :|\n. Ok, I got your point. It would be great if we could change it like you suggest in every case, but sometimes it is impossible. That extra file name is actually sent on purpose, since it is not always possible to change file name in multipart like this. When we are building our own multipart message - yes. But when we are using internal browser and plugin (Flash for example) technologies we are not allowed to alter it. That's why a second file name parameter (\"name\") was introduced in first place. If you look inside our bundled upload.php example, you will see that we handle file name differently, we basically ignore the one that comes with multipart filename and use parameter \"name\" only.\n. I guess there is no other solution to this \"issue\" currently. \nI will close it for now.\n. What do you mean by revert asap? What version are you using? Do you have your example online?\nAnd post your code please.\n. Can you post your configuration?\n. Doesn't look as faulty. Plupload definitely works in Firefox and Chrome. Does it happen it for you for every image? Have you tried jpegs for example?\n. Can you share problematic png file. Actually if you could zip some problematic examples (png, gif) and share through file sharing service of some kind, that'd be great.\n. Are you using latest build? 'cause we often update it daily.\n. Main reason for this is accept attribute of the input[type=\"file\"] element, which accepts mime types instead of extensions (anyone knows why?), so that we got to keep mimeType-to-extensions lookup map internally to support it properly, but only for the most wide-spread extensions. For obvious reasons we can't have each and every mimeType in there, however we've planned to give users ability to extend it if they require, for quite some time already.\nIn Plupload 2 it is much easier to do, so there you have it in the latest commit. I've updated nightly build as well. This is how one is meant to use it:\n``` javascript\n$(function() {\nmOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-aiff,aif aiff\"); // notice that it is called before Plupload initialization\n$(\"#uploader\").plupload({\n...\n\n```\nSo the format is: mOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"<mime-type>,<ext1> <ext2> <ext2>\");.\nHere's nice reference for MIME types: http://www.freeformatter.com/mime-types-list.html#mime-types-list\n. Are using Plupload 2 beta or a stable release? Can you post your configuration?\n. multipart by default is set to true, so this doesn't seem to be relevant. Maybe you got some filtering facilities somewhere between client and server?\nAlso make sure that your server side can accept files of such size - audio is usually bigger than image and there might be a limit. \nTry to enable chunking:\njavascript\n...\nruntimes: 'html5,flash',\nmax_file_size: '30mb',\nchunk_size: \"1mb\"\n...\n. Safari 5 has only partial html5 support, specifically it cannot preload files with FileReader or slice them to chunks, but it should be able to upload the file as a whole. Our upload.php takes that into account. Is file at least uploaded in your case?\nAlternatively you can explicitly request chunking support from the runtime and for Safari 5 Plupload will automatically fallback to the next runtime in the list. \njavascript\nvar uploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n        // General settings html5,\n        runtimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight,html4',\n        url : '../upload.php',\n        required_features: 'access_binary',  // comma separated list of features to take into account\n...\nThis thread on the forum is related: http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=9628#p9628\n. Right... documentation sucks a bit at the moment, but in your case my example above should be enough. I'm working on it :)\n. I guess other than lack of proper documentation, this one is not a bug. I will close it for now.\n. It will only work on client-side anyway. So if user uploads the file, refreshes the page and then uploads the same file again. It won't be prevented. Not sure how useful this might be...\n. Ok, you've convinced me :)\nI replied here to notify question: http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=2972\n. Probably some faulty jpeg. Let me check.\n. Seems like  .bmp image. Plupload currently considers only .png and .jpg as being images, the rest are just files.. No such switch currently.\n. Not exactly easier, but maybe resize better. It is scheduled to be implemented these days.\n. Plupload 2 now supports stripping off the meta headers, e.g.:\n``` javascript\n$(\"#uploader\").plupload({\n    runtimes : 'html5',\n    url : '../upload.php',\n    max_file_size : '1000mb',\n    max_file_count: 20, // user can add no more then 20 files at a time\n    chunk_size : '1mb',\n    rename : true,\n    multiple_queues : true,\n// Resize images on clientside if we can\nresize : {\n    width : 200, \n    height : 200, \n    quality : 90,\n    crop: true, \n    preserve_headers: false // (!)\n},\n   ...\n\n```\nSo basically pass preserve_headers in resize param object to false.\n. Actually we do send cache control headers from our bundled upload.php, so that might indeed be related somehow. Are you using bundled upload.php?\n. Web-server might be serving pages with auto-set cache headers, are you sure that's not the case (that's what is usually done for php at least)?\n. I didn't know at the time, but as it turned out, Flash can only return 200 and 404. The rest is beyond it.. N/A is simply a placeholder for file size, which is not available in IE8 and below (for html5/html4 runtimes). It is not an error.\nTry to get rid of the extra comma in your filters list, old IEs usually do not survive it:\njavascript\n { title: \"Image files\", extensions: \"jpg,jpeg,gif,png\" }, // <-- this one\n. Are you able to replicate the problem with the latest build?\n. Such method has been added recently to 2.x branch (current master) and made itself into the nightly build (Plupload 2 beta).\n. Tnx :)\n. Somewhat related #610.\n. Hm... observe nothing such in IE10.0.8250, Standards Mode, Windows 8.\n. Something like this is possible with Plupload 2 code base. \n. Check an example in our wiki: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/wiki/FileDrop.\n. Can you share particular image files on which you encounter the error?\n. In general - no, not common and shouldn't be happening. Are you encountering the error with the latest build?\n. Thanks for testing with us.\n. Sorry, where did you attach failed images?\n. Can you post your configuration?\n. Fixed in 611b179afdba70b5d8a477babb24aea702e24d46. I guess you are the first one to use resizing option with non multipart upload. Thanks for taking your time to report this back to us.\n. If dimensions of the image to resize were smaller than the width/height in resize options, image was not touched, so original image was uploaded. Is this the case?\nHowever in the latest build we've made it so that if quality param is present JPEG image will be processed in any case (in order to drop the size), otherwise original image will be uploaded.\n. Original plupload.html5.js can be found here on github, under 1.x branch.\n. It asks for password.\nBut let me ask you - how is this related to Plupload? :)\n. You should probably post this on Front End Upload forum, here: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/front-end-upload.\nI will close this now.\n. Pushed the tags. Sorry.\n. Wasn't able to repeat it here. Does it happen to you on bundled UI Widget example?\n. Yes I can confirm that, I'm working on alternative chunking solution, that doesn't simply append data to the end of the file (which will obviously fail if there was already an upload that was canceled), but will write a chunk at a specified offset in the temp file.\n. This has been fixed in 5946bec9aa2dd3d299b0b249954d00223f99a99a.\n. \"custom cancel button\" is not a proper id. And which of the \"pick file\" anchors is meant to become a Browse button? Can you post your config?\n. Have you checked s3 example that is bundled with current stable (1.5.5) Plupload?\n. In Plupload 2 there might be a case when various features are backed up with different runtimes. Although it is highly improbable, there's no guarantee for a specific runtime. That's why it might be subjected to removal. \n. In general every component (like FileInput instance for example) has a property: ruid, which basically is an id of runtime. One could then use that id to retrieve information about that runtime:\njavascript\nvar info = mOxie.Runtime.getInfo(ruid);\n. Not uploader.id but ruid property of fileInput object. But, you are right it is internal to plupload and not exposed, hmm...\nAlternatively you can simply inspect id for Plupload shim on top of browse_button element, which gets runtime type appended to it's id.\n. Flash resize method is not the same as HTML5's and should be by a degree better. Definitely not the same thing at least. Maybe you should try again and make sure that you have only Flash runtime in runtimes list. Also thumbs (previews) are always done in HTML5 (when it's supported by the browser), so the only proper way to compare results of the client-side resizing would be by checking uploaded images.\nI'm saying this because if you find Flash resize good enough, we can adapt other methods to it as well.\n. @robfaas, can you share original of that image for us to take some samples?\n. I'm experimenting with several algorithms, although it definitely won't make it into a release, in nearest week or so. Although if you are our OEM license holder we can build a special release for you. Send a message to our support mail.\n. @joonsp that's what we do in Flash runtime, but as original poster noticed - it is not that big of a difference. Proper resampling has no alternative I'm afraid.\n. I've just merged in a branch with better quality resizing for the Flash runtime (https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/e63c4efcd7081401079e2ca786a50f5b51517801). It uses Pixel Bender, some simple shaders and gradual scaling.\n. @ml48603, simple solution would be to simply not use resize option in your Plupload config. More sophisticated way includes custom compiling with exclusion of the image manipulation module and using of our mini versions of Flash and Silverlight shims, that do not have image related code in them, and weight much less. You can find them in the bin/ folder of the underlying moxie project here.\n. If you guys can suggest difficult photos for me to test, please do.\n. Here is the resizing with updated Flash runtime:\n- Default:\n  \n- Bilinear resampling:\n  \nOriginal image can be found here (random image from the Google).\n. @robfaas, Downsized to 222x300.\n- Default (old):\n  \n- Default:\n  \n- Bilinear:\n  \n. @dzymail we cannot know what the exact size will be before we do the actual resizing. We can approximate (roughly), or resize the images right after selection (which might be an option I think). \nI do not know what jQuery-File-Upload does, can you arrange the demo (of the feature you've mentioned)? \n. This has become a frequently requested feature, so I guess I need to implement it... one way or another.\n. From what I see, it looks like jquery-file-upload pre-resizes image to get the final size and then resizes again..? \n. Plupload 3.0-beta1 is out now. We also think to back port resampling stuff to Plupload 2.x branch,'cause Plupload 3 is basically ground up rewrite.\n. I've backported image resizing improvements to v2.x branch. v2.2.0 stable is out now.\n. @farflungideas I guess we better file it as separate ticket.\n. @robfaas there's a newer page (in the works) hiding: http://www.plupload.com/docs/v3/Image-Resizing-on-Client-Side. But yes, still need to modify that intro a bit.\n. @ciganox we did bicubic, but it turned out to be too slow to be usable. And definitely almost meaningless to port to other runtimes.. Difference will be noticeable only when you do a dramatic resize (like several times smaller, or - larger). Otherwise it should feel the same (it is expected), since browsers do use bilinear by default these days.. What are you comparing to?. @ciganox v2.x and v3.x both use the same version of moxie. Image resizing logic is in moxie,not in Plupload. So they are using the same thing. \ndefault is basically - bilinear, since in flash/silverlight the give almost the same result. nearest, which is nearest neighbour and wasn't enabled in html5 runtime until now (not sure why I forgot that), is 3-5 times faster and perfect for thumbs for example.. We have a better way of managing translations on new site. No need to alter files by hand, which proved itself to be error prone.\nI will be putting the site and new i18n management tool online this week.\n. Might be something specific to your server. Can you give us access?\n. I read the thread, it has to be something specific to your environment, so I better simply have a look. Send the link and access info, if any to this email.\n. We do include the en.js now. We are using Transifex now for language management. You can register there and join corresponding language teams, to contribute and receive updates.\n. The only usable role I could find was input. Definition of Roles.\nIdeas?\nSupporting keyboard and tab is good idea. Not sure if it will be consistent across the runtimes though.\n. Yes, it's pretty raw and still frequently modified, definitely not for faint hearted :) Thanks for trying. Will look into cleaning the mess and documenting it better.\n. But I should note that moxie now comes with pre-build binaries and js files. You can find them under bin/ folder in the repo.\n. Build process has been simplified now and docs properly reflect it.\n. plupload_2_0a.21021401 is the latest build. Does it work properly with FB.Canvas.setAutoGrow();?\n. Try plupload_2_0a.22021333. I've updated the build.\n. Somewhere up there is a limit on resolution that can be handled by today's browsers. And it's not only html5, but also flash and silverlight. In Plupload 2 we now set the max supported width/height to 6500x6500 (to be safe), if dimensions of the image are larger it won't be tampered and will be uploaded to the server as is.\n. Relevant: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/547. What is the version of Plupload you are trying?\n. Build is constantly updated, with bugfixes. Could you try current one?\n. Since you are building custom UI and probably are using moxie Image wrapper directly, you could simply load the source in it (that's what you have to do to downsize anyway) and listen to onerror and onresize events on image object. If the source is compatible image will be resize and onresize will be triggered, otherwise - onerror.\n. @ovkhasch I will check html4. However having alternative code in onerror handler seems pretty much ok in general. After all, even image has jpg or png extension, it may appear corrupt or not in format it pretends to be in. No error should propagate to the browser though, if it does, then it's a bug. \nBtw if you are looking to have thumbnails across all browsers, even legacy ones, I would suggest removing html4 from runtime list, since while it tries to display thumbs in browsers that support canvas or dataUrl in older browsers it will obviously fail.\n. We do follow existing APIs there, that do not have detailed error messages. I'm not sure why but it probably won't change. :/. Post your conf please.\n. We've dropped gears in Plupload 2. Other than that seems ok. I will check.\n. Could you please try the latest build? Cannot replicate this.\n. We probably won't be extending internal mime-to-extension map anymore - already quite large. Alternatively, in Plupload 2 we've exposed a method that you can use to extend it yourself.\nExamples and instructions here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/682#issuecomment-12321058\n. @skovhus, it is more ready than it is not, I still have to add some unit tests for image handling though. I'm going to schedule stable Plupload 2 release for next thursday. Should be somewhere there.\n@inghamc, whole accept mime type approach is quite inconvenient and erroneous, not sure why they've ended up with mime types and not extensions, after all contents of the file are never inspected (after checking webkit source I can say that they do inspect magic numbers, but for quite limited set of formats). Plupload 2 does nothing special under the hood, since there is nothing special to do anyway. flv definitely worked fine and we even have this mapping internally. One thing you can try is map flv and mkv to generic mime type video/* rather than specific one. According to compatibility tables it should do.\nLet us know about your findings if you stumble on something interesting :)\n. Exception or a warning? I mean does Plupload still load or it fails?\n. http://www.plupload.com/example_events.php indeed was using flash runtime, because it was placed first in the list. I replaced it with html5 now. For me it takes html5 without failing. All I get is a notice in the console: \n\"ArrayBuffer is deprecated in XMLHttpRequest.send(). Use ArrayBufferView instead.\"\nWhile this is probably not exactly elegant, but until they actually drop using ArrayBuffer in XMLHttpRequest.send() we can't nicely feature detect this. So...\nWhat you mean by: \"Older version now throw \"Illegal constructor\" exception because of ArrayBufferView.\". Where do you get this?\n. It is not exactly solved. It's just that it shouldn't be a real problem just yet. Although if you replace ArrayBuffer with ArrayBufferView, it will fail and throw an error on Chrome pre 22 versions.\n. This is expected. {response: \"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":100,\"message\":\"Failed to open temp directory\"},\"id\":\"id\"}\", status: 200} is only example of the response not the actual thing for Plupload to take into account. You can as well send back html or json. Plupload works on lower level and will pass this content through to the FileUploaded handler, for you to react. But should report you about network issue, server unreachable, 404 etc. If you really want it to trigger error, send back HTTP error response (something bigger than 400).\n. Does this occur to you only in IE9?\n. Do you have your implementation online? Tested in Chrome, IE10/9, seems ok here.\n. Narrowed this issue to an interesting fact, in default upload mode Flash doesn't trigger httpStatus event for successful uploads, it does so only for failed ones. This was the obvious reason for status code 0 in default mode. Apparently overlooked this, as it is not possible to unit test default upload mode in automated way. All our tests right now are adapted to our artificial upload mode. Thanks for reporting this to us and all your efforts to workaround it, that helped me  track it down.\nFix is now incorporated into the final beta build. We've postponed stable release once more as memory leakage was noticed in image resizing. Final build has corrections for this problem as well.\n. Yes, updated build is now available on Plupload site. We had to postpone stable release once more, as we encountered some ugly memory leaks. That should be fixed by now as well.\n. I will close this now. You are welcome to re-open it if problem manifests itself again.\n. Doesn't happen to me. I guess if you are still interested in this being fixed, we should look deeper into your code and case.\n. @bobbytackett, does your server allow uploading of such big files? Might be trivial, but easy to overlook.\n@coldscientist, what was server's http response status when you were getting this error in flash?\n. I'm experimenting now with conditional selection of chunking, depending on requested file size and abilities of a specific runtime. But this is probably topic for another thread.\n. Hmm... this problem existed previously, but has been fixed quite some time ago, and in my tests here it reports file as having wrong extension.\nIn case you are building custom implementation - file will still be reported in FilesAdded, but won't be added to the queue, unless you are overriding default FilesAdded handler.\n. Actually I'm testing it in Chrome 25 on Mac. Doesn't UI Widget throw a notification in the header with exclamation mark on the file? Are you using the latest build (we update it quite often)?\n. Build number is basically a date, you can lookup the commits that happened since then.\n. 02-Mar 11:51\n. I will close this now, since it is not repeatable here in latest Plupload 2 build. Feel free to re-open if experience it otherwise.\n. This is interesting, I would like to pull that in, but there's a problem - I'm not exactly VB specialist, do you mind if I redirect all reports that might arise regarding this VB chunk here - to you? :)\n. Great. However for Plupload 2 we've switched the whole build and automation process to Node.js.\n. I will cherry-pick those commits.\n. I've pulled in VB part of this request. If you could write a little \"Getting Starting with VB build script\" tutorial, would be nice :)\n. Are you saying is that you get Google Chrome Renderer going crazy and NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY error thrown with as many as three 1.5MB image files?\nIn what example on the site do you experience this?\nPost your config and Plupload version as well please.\n. I'm addressing this problem in Plupload 2 (should get into the next build and the stable release, which I had to postpone because of this) and while I was able to stop unlimited growth of memory usage and consequently the crashes and out of memory errors, browsers still tend to fill as much memory as system lets them to. I guess that's how they are built to operate. There's no real control over this from within the browser. But eventually when system requests the memory for different purposes, browsers will probably drop it.\nAny further observations and suggestions are welcome.\n. All the fixes for memory leakage were now incorporated in final beta build of Plupload 2. \n. No. Plupload doesn't support this at the moment. But interesting feature. Thanks for suggestion.\n. https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1092. Custom example mistakenly attached event handlers prior to internal ones. That caused the confusion (#818). This is now fixed.\n. Post your configuration as well please.\n. Safari didn't have support for chunks at the moment, so it was uploading the whole file directly. $_REQUEST and $_FILES become empty when PHP doesn't accept requests that big. One should check if max_file_uploads and post_max_size in php.ini have big enough values.\n. Sorry not sure how I can help you here. Upload your mootools build somewhere maybe?\n. Sorry, what's the problem again?\n. getSource() is not supposed to return native file, not that of PluploadFile at least. It returns a wrapper around runtime representation of the file. For html5 runtime getSource() of the wrapper will return native file. So for PluploadFile object it will look something like this:\nfile.getSource().getSource()\n. Are you calling it on PluploadFile object?\n. It is very raw and constantly mutating by the moment. But why would you want to built it manually - all the binaries and js files are available under bin/ folder in moxie repo.\n. It shouldn't be difficult to build it. Actually I've tested now and bootstrap still works for me. Does it report a problem of some kind in your case or just hang? Are you building on *nix or windows?\nnode bootstrap is currently available only for moxie. Have you also tried instructions over there?\nSo the logic is like this: you build moxie (all of it, including swf/xap) and then run jake release in plupload root.\n. I will try to make the process consistent and easy tomorrow.\n. Related #794.\nI've straightened build logic and updated readme.\nDownload Plupload and all its submodules, including mOxie:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload.git\nInstall pre-requisites and prepare build environment:\nnpm install\nBuild Plupload:\njake release\n. This is expected exception. Fallback from flash to html5 in your case might take as long as 15 secs. Flash tries for 5 secs and silverlight for 10 (as it is sometimes hard for it to initialize quickly on first load). I'd recommend to put html5 first. When browser has support for it, it is by far the best runtime to use.\n. Addressed this in: 06c7aeb6d4188948fcf4b5e714cb4849002fcf6c. Will not let exceptions out anymore.\n. Post your full configuration. Browser type, version and OS.\n. Do not observe anything like this here.\n. Sometimes they will be blank, for Flash for example, that's why we kept it private so far. If you absolutely require response headers, then you can pass return_response_headers as one of required features and runtime selection will be constrained to only those runtimes that support it. E.g.:\n``` javascript\n...\nurl: 'upload.php',\nrequired_features: 'return_response_headers'\n...\n```\n. Plupload doesn't treat 302 in any special way, so it's just default browser behavior in action. Why? Doesn't it redirect to the url passed with 302?\n. Hmm... need to dig deeper maybe, although it's a topic for another ticket probably.\n. Does this mean that you succeeded to upload multipart to Amazon S3?\n. Can you share an example? People ask for it and I couldn't come up with one so far. Specifically multipart upload to Amazon S3.\n. I'm all up to it. In Flash or Silverlight upload to S3 is possible in general, but not multipart. If I remember correctly Amazon requires PUT requests for chunks?.. \nI've started new wiki entry here: Upload to Amazon S3 using HTML5 runtime. Obviously not proposing any structure yet. It could mutate on the go and maybe even split to separate pages.\n. Ok, good start is like half the job :) Although this is not exactly Amazon's multipart... well... actually it is, but not as Amazon understands it. But it is of course their fault (why on earth would anyone call chunked upload - multipart?..).\nI would like to try it though. Will be updating the doc.\n. @jbourassa, I couldn't find time to try it yet, but I definitely looking to make it work. \nFor direct upload to S3 we got an example here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/examples/jquery/s3.php. Was it failing for you?\n. Yes, it's an old one, left over from 1.x Plupload. html5 was not possible back then.\n. We probably won't be merging this, since it breaks quite some logic paths. Also with the introduction of BeforeChunkUpload event, name can now be set in handler, just before chunk is uploaded. . You do get full text response in FileUploaded as a third argument:\njavascript\nuploader.bind('FileUploaded', function(up, file, result) {\n    console.info(result);\n    // result is an object containing two keys: result.response (full text response) \n    // and result.status (HTTP status code)\n});\n. Request headers and status codes other than 200 and 404 are not guaranteed across the runtimes. This is probably the main reason why we do not rely on them. The way we recommend to handle this is to send JSON response, be it OK or FAIL and manipulate it in FileUploaded.\n. Can you post your code? Config and HTML.\n. I've updated the build with potential fix. Feel free to reopen this if you still encounter it.\n. Do not think we will ever add this to Plupload (since it is meant to stay a mere file uploader). However one could implement such functionality separately, then construct the blob and feed it to the Plupload for the upload operation. Mobiles for example let you capture stuff with your camera when you click browse button. This happens natively. The only requirement is to remove multi_selection option from Plupload conf or set to false, since device obviously cannot capture multiple pictures or videos at once.\n. Yes, weird Flash case. We've addressed this in Plupload 2 though. So it shouldn't be a problem anymore when we finally launch it.\n. You can pass whatever additional you need through multipart_params with every upload.\n. Obvious omission.\n. I can't troubleshoot your case, unless you have it somewhere online, or maybe you can tunnel it out for a moment? This obviously is not a typical case, so it might be something specific. Try to comment out second instance on the page. Also try to put only single runtime in the list - only html5, then only flash.\n. Maybe it is something with the #newpreview-file element being not accessible on the page or something. Try to remove everything from FilesAdded handler and do a simple console log or alert.\nDoes it actually fire for you on our example pages?\n. Were you able to make it work finally? I didn't notice the first time, but you seem to have max_file_size filter, although not sure if it ever gets activated. You could bind an Error event handler as well and see if anything pops out. Otherwise its completely not repeatable on our end.\nFeel free to re-open this, if there's any update.\n. Hm... this should not work... something not right there.\n@Jugram, does #container element really exist on your page? What your workaround does, is that it routes a click on the browse button to the plupload trigger. While this is ok for FF, WebKit and IE10, it might fail in IE9- for example or some other legacy browsers.\nIf you have your case online, I might help you to troubleshoot the actual problem - improper placement of the Plupload element.\n. triggerDialog is meant to be false for IE, that's not a bug. But can't you show us how you use it? If you can't post the site url, could you at least post html structure that you use? But site url would help us to nail it exactly.\n. javascript\n    var uploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n            runtimes : 'gears,html5,flash,silverlight,browserplus',\n            browse_button : 'pickfiles',\n            container : 'uploadcontainer',\n            chunk_size: '1mb',\n            unique_names: true,\n            max_file_size : '5mb',\n            max_file_count : 1,\n            multi_selection: true,\n            url: '<!-- my url -->',\n            filters: [{ title: \"Image files\", extensions: 'jpg'}],\n            flash_swf_url: '@Url.Content( \"~/Scripts/plup/plupload.flash.swf\" )',\n            silverlight_xap_url: '@Url.Content(\"~/Scripts/plup/plupload.silverlight.xap\")'\n        });\nTry to pass uploadcontainer as a value for container option.\nOr even better give an id to  <div class=\"controls\"> element and pass it as a value for container option.\nBtw, in Plupload 2 passing ids is not required anymore and config can accept DOM elements directly.\n. Browser sniffing for triggerDialog is rare exception rather than a rule. We are open to any suggestions of how to feature detect it. Other than that Plupload has been tried on IE10, and other browsers, so the issue here is rather specific. If you could arrange a failing example somewhere online, it could help to solve this, as we do not encounter it in our cases here.\n. I didn't notice the first time, but looking at the css of the the inserted structure I saw this: width: 0px; height: 0px;, so basically what happens is that dimensions for the file picker are not set properly. This usually happens when browse button is hidden at the time of Plupload initialization. There's no cure for this. If you guys want to show Plupload in a popup for example, make sure that popup is open and ready and then initialize Plupload, or call uploader.refresh() on it if you already initialized Plupload previously. uploader.refresh() resizes and repositions Plupload structures to fit the browse button. Obviously there's no way to measure hidden element. The fact that it happens only in IE10 is not an excuse for not taking into account what I just wrote. It maybe a matter of timing. Chrome maybe faster a bit, IE10 a bit slower, but the point is the same.\n. @MrGorki, are you having problems on IE10 or IE11? Have you tried updated binaries from under js/ folder here on github?\n. 3000px should still be ok, problems usually start somewhere over 8000px. Can you share the image that causes you trouble? \n. It works in our tests with jpeg we have here, it might be specific to whatever jpeg you are trying to upload. So, please share, if it's not top secret :)\n. Updated the build with the fix. Can you check if it works for you?\n. Good point, I'll consider that.\n. Are you using Plupload 2? Or 1.x?\nI've updated 1.x branch with proper fix now and made 1.5.7 bugfix release available for download on Plupload site.\n. 1.5.7 is out now and it has the fix for this bug.\n. I guess it's fixed now?\n. The problem here is that depending on the runtime you might not even get a response body when status code is error. Are you on stable 1.x branch?\nDoes Amazon log only status, or the whole erroneous POST body?\n. I'm asking because 400 MalformedPOSTRequest is already kinda informative and there could be nothing else in the response anyway. What can help, could be an actual body of such malformed request.\nFrom Error Responses:\nMalformedPOSTRequest - The body of your POST request is not well-formed multipart/form-data.\nCould you post Plupload config that you use?\n. No chunking, no client-resizing... hm... seems like Plupload is using native upload methods for both html5, and flash. For some reason though I think this should be flash failing. Anyway, this is bad, as default upload methods can't be affected in any way...\nDo you got any additional details, like the browser type and version where failure was detected? or have the file that failed? Do you know if failed file ever uploaded successfully afterwards?\n. I've been looking in this since we've added exifParser, not sure why we never actually implemented it. \n. I'll definitely get to this at some point, it's just that need to get Plupload 2 out of beta finally, launch new site and write more docs first. You are welcome to contribute in any way, be it scripting or buying one of our OEM licenses.\n. Interesting usage case, haven't come to mind. In the latest nightly you will be able to do bring it back like this:\njavascript\n...\nchunks: {  // instead of chunk_size\n    size: '200kb',\n    send_chunk_number: true // activates original format\n},\n...\nImportant: you will need to use upload.php format from 1.x branch.\n. Nightly got updated.\n. Sorry guys (@rsdrsd), it was meant to be there.\n. Plupload 2 supports CORS. Original version (1.x branch) is now frozen and accepts only bug fixes.\n. He... is this the only problem with the readme? I'm not a native english-speaker you know..\n. @iepathos Are you serious about fixed grammar and punctuation throughout?\n@AliasM2K I think your first impression was different, what made you change your mind? Just curious.\n. Oh... didn't notice final commit. Let me read through :)\n. In general I agree :) I would prefer it server-side too. We did it client-side... because we could. Also upload.php is simply an example, we do not consider it as part of Plupload.\n.  I do not think this should be a part of Plupload. \n- upload.php is just an example\n- Plupload in general is more client oriented\n- Plupload doesn't handle jsonrpc responses internally\n- change will require us to send additional parameter to the server to tell when server should generate unique name\nQuite some change required to make it work and benefit is really negligible. Generating unique name on server-side is quite simple if one requires it, something like: $filename = uniqid(); (in PHP)\n. This one of the reasons why we do it on client-side.\n. Can you share typical image that fails to retain iptc data?\n. Ehm... what you mean during the upload?Do you do those manipulations client-side or after file is uploaded? I'm asking because we actually do preserve IPTC, I just wanted to check why it doesn't get preserved in your case.\n. Ok, I see - you do extract the data before you do any further manipulations, so they shouldn't matter. I will check why IPTC gets stripped in your case.\n. We've ported our translation facilities to Transifex. If you could create account and request membership in translation team for Italian language I will get you approved. All consequent Plupload releases will request translations from there.\n. Do not use for (var i in files). I've also updated the custom example to not use it. The problem is that Mootools modifies prototype of the Array object, adding it's own convenient methods to it and for..in loops not only over array items, but over inherited ones as well.\n. Could have been a buggy build maybe. Otherwise I can't repeat it with the latest one. Could you try?\nWhat you describe might be happening when: multipart set to false.\n. No OPTIONS, hm... Can you post specific versions of the browsers that fail?\nPlupload assigns 0 to status property in two cases, when a check for xhr.status throws exception (might happen for readyStates other than 4) or if server is unreachable (Gecko used to do this). However in 1.x branch we do not consider status == 0 as error which is a bug I guess... :|\nIs it possible you try Plupload 2?\n. What kind of issues you had with Plupload 2?\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/240. In theory this should be handled gracefully by the browser itself. But I've added a condition to consider all HTTP statuses below 200 as errors as well. Just in case.. It might not work properly for Flash runtime in default mode, but otherwise SSL should just ok. Have you tried and it failed or why such conclusion?\n. It might be that you are not configuring it properly. It should upload just fine in html5, flash and silverlight. Do you actually allow connection over HTTPS in your crossdomain.xml?\nAs bare minimum it should look like this:\nxml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM\n\"http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\">\n<cross-domain-policy>\n  <allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\" />\n</cross-domain-policy>\nNotice secure=\"false\".\nBut it is a confusing topic in general, so I will probably write an insightful tutorial here in wiki.\n. Flash and Silverlight do not allow access to response body (at least in default mode - that's what everyone uses) when there is an error. All they report is -SecurityError. That's all you have.\nWe are all up to better error reporting (improved it in Plupload 2). And suggestions are of course welcome :)\n. There's a detailed step by step tutorial now of how to upload to Amazon S3.\n. This is strange. Can you put it online somewhere?\n. I notice the problem in your example, however your config looks ok. Here I've arranged a test-case, with your config (basically a copy/paste - with replaced urls and credentials): http://plupload.com/cases/s3.php\nMaybe you should try to create different bucket and set ACL, CORS from scratch. Maybe there's something you overlook.\n. US Standard.\n. Hm... so you make your bucket public (grant upload/delete to everyone) and then set up the CORS with config exactly like this:\nxml\n<CORSConfiguration>\n    <CORSRule>\n        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>\n        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>\n        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>\n        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>\n        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>\n    </CORSRule>\n</CORSConfiguration>\n?\n. Maybe that dot in your bucket name was the reason? Maybe you try the name with only letters in it?\n. https encrypts the traffic, that's the difference. You decide :)\n. Can you post the link of the resource where this problem is reported or described?\n. Tnx. Updated the guide with dot case :)\nI guess this can be closed now.\n. This is one of the reason why uploader.refresh() exists, in first place. \nDoes your hidden browse button element have dimensions (like explicit width/height)?\n. It is impossible to measure dimensions of hidden element as well as locate it's position on screen. Browse button should be visible when you initialize Plupload, or you should call uploader.refresh() everytime you show browse button or move it.\n. Are you sending filename back in server response? What is the version of IE that has this problem?\n. Turned out to be a problem in window.atob/window.btoa. It is fixed now in moxie repo. I will update a build soon.\n. Yes, there is a chance... It will land in 2.2. Or maybe even in 2.1.\n. There are various reasons why you shouldn't be using 1.x branch anymore. But why would you, can you list the reasons to stick with 1.x?\n. After upgrade first year is free and next year is half the price. So upgrade brings only benefits I think. But our sales department (http://moxiecode.com/contact.php) knows better I guess. \n. This is not a bug, check this QA from our FAQ: Although I specify file extension in filters, I still cannot pick it up in file dialog or drag and drop, why?\n. The way you are doing this is the only way I guess. Not sure what we could do about it?\n. iPad v1 and actually any iDevice running iOS version less than 6 does not support input[type=\"file\"]. Plupload uploader fires Error event whenever it is not able to initialize any runtime. You can subscribe to it and warn your users.\n. Can you screenshot it?\n. You need to wait until Plupload is initialized at least, before you try to open it in colorbox. Also be sure to call refresh() on uploader every time it opens - just in case. For example something like this should work just fine: \n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n Load plupload and all it's runtimes and finally the jQuery queue widget \n\n\n\n\nCustom example\ncolorbox\n\nNo runtime found.\n\n[Select files]\n[Upload files]\n\n\n// Custom example logic\n$(function() {</p>\n<pre><code>var uploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n    runtimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight,browserplus',\n    browse_button : 'pickfiles',\n    container : 'container',\n    max_file_size : '10mb',\n    url : 'upload.php',\n    flash_swf_url : '/plupload/js/plupload.flash.swf',\n    silverlight_xap_url : '/plupload/js/plupload.silverlight.xap',\n    filters : [\n        {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"},\n        {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip\"}\n    ],\n    resize : {width : 320, height : 240, quality : 90}\n});\n\nuploader.bind('Init', function(up, params) {\n    $('#filelist').html(\"&lt;div&gt;Current runtime: \" + params.runtime + \"&lt;/div&gt;\");\n});\n\nuploader.bind('PostInit', function(up) {\n    $(\".inline\").colorbox({\n        inline:true, \n        width:\"50%\",\n        onComplete: function() {\n            up.refresh();\n        }\n     }).click();\n});\n\n$('#uploadfiles').click(function(e) {\n    uploader.start();\n    e.preventDefault();\n});\n\nuploader.init();\n\nuploader.bind('FilesAdded', function(up, files) {\n    $.each(files, function(i, file) {\n        $('#filelist').append(\n            '&lt;div id=\"' + file.id + '\"&gt;' +\n            file.name + ' (' + plupload.formatSize(file.size) + ') &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;' +\n        '&lt;/div&gt;');\n    });\n\n    up.refresh(); // Reposition Flash/Silverlight\n});\n\nuploader.bind('UploadProgress', function(up, file) {\n    $('#' + file.id + \" b\").html(file.percent + \"%\");\n});\n\nuploader.bind('Error', function(up, err) {\n    $('#filelist').append(\"&lt;div&gt;Error: \" + err.code +\n        \", Message: \" + err.message +\n        (err.file ? \", File: \" + err.file.name : \"\") +\n        \"&lt;/div&gt;\"\n    );\n\n    up.refresh(); // Reposition Flash/Silverlight\n});\n\nuploader.bind('FileUploaded', function(up, file) {\n    $('#' + file.id + \" b\").html(\"100%\");\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>});\n\n\n\n```\nThe fact that it works in other browsers is not an excuse in this case. Maybe undesired, but definitely expected behavior, so - not a bug.\n. Never observed anything like this so far. If you are testing it locally it might be simply that upload so quick that progress event doesn't have enough time to fire.\n. Plupload 2 passes our chunking unit tests in all runtimes. So could you clarify on what you encounter exactly? What do you mean by \"in most cases\" - sometimes it succeeds sometimes not?\nIf you could arrange failing case online somewhere it could help enormously.\n. Try to set $cleanupTargetDir to false in upload.php and see if it helps.\n. Here is a functional test case with your config (only images allowed). Script urls are changed,  chunk size decreased to 100kb, otherwise it is exactly your config. Tested in IE8 and FF20. Didn't notice any problematic behavior.\nAre you using upload.php from Plupload 2 package (it is different from original 1.x upload.php) ?\n. Example that I've referenced uses upload.php from the package.\nThe error that you mention: \"Failed to open output stream\" is thrown when upload.php cannot open temp file containing partial data. Try to lower the chunk size, maybe your server has limit on file size that it can accept or maybe it doesn't allow creation of files with .part extension (for whatever reason).\n. Have you happened to have a time to play any further with this one?\n. Can't replicate this with current nightly. Closing for now.\n. alert() is blocking and primitive. Better print it the message into a pre container or use remote debugging.. Updated with proper build instructions now (c2022c4f16ee20d4b10786809055fb507af8546b).\n. This is going to change in favor of simple: npm install.\n. This should be fixed by now in both branches.\n. There was no release, but precompiled files are available for both branches under js/ folder.\n. Right, because config contains resize and by default requires multi_selection. Got to remove html4 from the list of runtimes there.\n. It also requires multi_selection: false. What do you mean break? It's just that those parameters are not compatible with html4.\nDo you suggest anything else?\n. Then you do not specify resize and set multi_selection to false. Isn't that logical?\n. The latest nightly of Plupload 2 now has a special static method predictRuntime() that accepts the same settings object as the uploader itself and returns runtime identifier.\n. Could you please go in more detail on when do you get this one? It is not something that we get on regular basis.\nURIError: URI malformed... - what kind of uri you are using?\n. Could you share that \"normal\" uri here? It must have something specific about it.\n. This is not a bug, we just do not have file type icons (we are not good at designing stuff). Thumb view is really meant for image upload only, you can easily disable it:\njavascript\n...\n// Views to activate\nviews: {\n    list: true,\n    thumbs: false, // Hide thumbs\n    active: 'list'\n}\n. You are welcome to suggest some open source file type icons here :)\n. You mentioned zip and gif, first is not the image, second is not supported (only jpeg and png get displayed).\n. Mootools adds lots of convenience methods to the prototype of the Array and by using for (... in ...) you are basically looping all over them.\njavascript\nuploader.bind('FilesAdded', function(up, files) {\n    for (var i in files) { // <-- looping over object properties, both - owned and inherited\n        $('filelist').innerHTML += '<div id=\"' + files[i].id + '\">' + files[i].name + ' (' + plupload.formatSize(files[i].size) + ') <b></b></div>';\n    }\n});\nI'd suggest that you rather use standard for (...; ...; ...) loop or plupload.each or Array.each (from Mootools) instead.\n. As of the latest version seems unrepeatable in Win7 + IE10.\n. IE8/IE9 requires other runtime than html5, like flash, silverlight or html4. Do you have them in the list? Also your browser should have appropriate plugins (e.g. Flash Player) installed. \n. Have you had swf and xap shims referenced properly? Please provide more information then, Plupload version, config, or maybe an online case?\nI need to come up with a playground of some kind... hm.\n. Environment where Plupload container has to show/hide is potentially troublesome, especially for third party shims, like Flash and Silverlight. Use refresh method after you show the dialog with Plupload.\n. There's no real reason for this, might be something specific to your markup, I see that you have form inside em for example, it might get troublesome for legacy ie to properly measure positions and dimensions in such cases. If you have it online I could check directly.\n. This error has been fixed in fee17bd4a64bb47c99a48b2e98a299af06ac7750, although not yet released as nightly build.\nIn general it looks like file picker is never initialized in your case, can you put it together somewhere online? That would help a lot.\n. Fresh nightly is out. Problem should fixed now. Feel free to re-open if - not.\n. Since this is quite specific, it would help if you organize a case online. Possible?\n. I'll take a deeper look, although what I see right away is that by the time you click Start Upload button Flash object is already gone from the DOM (that's what that error is all about), maybe you are doing some DOM manipulation after file is selected, that wipes off the object.\n. You set the parent container's display rule to none, Flash object cannot operate when it's hidden (Flash feature). Try to use some other DOM element as a container.\n. Tnx, we'll put it to good use :)\n. Can you describe a typical scenario, where you would use something like that? A bit less generic.\n. This a nice hack. We were constantly inquired if something like this was possible. Interesting way to inject this in. Tnx. I will consider to add this in some way.\nOne note - you better explicitly constrain the list of runtimes to html5 only, to avoid unexpected behavior in legacy browsers - flash doesn't allow methods other than GET or POST (unless you rely on sockets, which brings the whole new level of complexities) and silverlight was never tested (it should be ok in theory).\n. No. No PUT method in Flash Player (unless you go down to sockets). In AIR - apparently yes, but not in Flash Player. Notice the red triangle (AIR icon) along some HTTP methods.\n. @joegreen0991, no - never got any response. But in general Flash is not a good runtime for chunked upload anyway, since it has to preload the whole file in memory first.\n. Related #57.\n. Yes, it is going to be added. Scheduled for 2.1. Although We still need to push 2.0 out.\n. Rescheduled to 2.2.\n. It seems that input[type=\"file\"] is read-only in IE, so no way to reset it's value manually, only selection of other files (change happens) alters it.\n. This was meant to be on purpose. Only queued and uploaded files can be removed.\n. This is intended, unless you have multiple_queues set to true.\n. I want to pull this in, although js/jquery.ui.plupload/jquery.ui.plupload.js is a generated file. You can find a source version under src/.\n. Merged in 7c54e8ffd422cda0afd2f01a7c66e0b08072dcac.\n. Subdomain still considered as another domain. HTML4 doesn't support cross-domain uploads. In Plupload 2 we handle errors in more consistent way though.\n. What you mean - domain relaxing?\n. Why there shouldn't be a cross-domain case involved when you load your resources from another domain (sub-domain is still considered another domain)..? Do the domains of the page with Plupload and that of upload url differ or no?\nhtml5, flash, silverlight do support CORS, although they require some pre-requisites, html4 throws security error, so there's no way to check if file upload went successfully or not.\nWhat would be a correct moment to do domain relaxing in our case you think? html4 uses hidden iframe to upload files.\n. This should be ok, unless you are explicitly waiting for chunk and chunks parameters. Are you using our bundled upload.php, or something of your own?\n. @BronKode hmm... other runtimes? Are we talking about 1.x branch then? 'cause in Plupload 2 all runtimes send only parameters that are passed from js, so it should be common for all of them.\n. No, it's ok. Just got confused a bit. You've hinted me to a bigger problem, so thanks ;) I'll fix both now.\n. Hmmm... loading animation simply stays visible through transparency... never occurred to me.\n. out-of the box custom.html doesn't use any chunking, so this might not be related.\n@strgg, in what browser does this happen to you? It is not a case here, could you arrange an online example?\n@JFOC when files is smaller than chunk_size it is simply uploaded as if chunking was disabled. It might cause the problem if you are not expecting something like this on server-side. Thinking about this I now see how this can be a problem in self-written upload handlers.\n. ehm... not sure I got it right. Are you using our bundled upload.php or something of your own? If it's the latter case can you post the code?\n. Copying my question above.\n@strgg, in what browser does this happen to you? It is not a case here (in our unit tests), could you arrange an online example, for us to investigate? That would help a lot.\n. @JFOC can you try as well, for me it reaches 100% every time..? FF21, but on Mac, I'll try on Windows when I'm back to my workstation.\n. 5kb... yeah, you nailed it now I guess, probably happens when upload finishes too fast for progress event to fire at all.\n. Turned out to be something different and much simpler, although more confusing - one simply needs to call uploader.init() before he binds listeners to either FilesAdded or UploadProgress, otherwise they will run before default ones and result in various unexplainable errors. But my mistake, I misplaced it in the example. I now rewrote that example on big part to avoid confusion completely (Related #735).\n. @JFOC, the problem that @strgg has encountered was specifically about a mistake in custom.html. Your case seems something completely different, as there is no such error in UI Widget. Can you open another ticket and maybe post some additional information? For example does it happen to you in a specific browser (while the problem in custom.html had to be fixed anyway, it still manifested itself only in FF on Windows (!)).\n. If you have max_file_count in your config it will automatically set multiple_queues to false, successfully ignoring the value you specify. There's a comment in jquery_ui_widget.html along that option. Remove it if you do not need it, since it doesn't have any sense with multiple_queues set to true anyway.\nYou are welcome to re-open this ticket if the problem persists.\n. Can you confirm if the problem is still there with the lastest nightly? Doesn't show up in our test suites.\n. Last minute bug fixed (#829). Be sure you have the latest nightly.\n. Hm... I remember responding to this ticket before... :\\\nMight have been a conflict between compiled scripts. Were you downloading a build or compiled files?\n. On the other note - check #819 for simultaneous use of max_file_count and multiple_queues.\n. This looks like a code to prevent duplicate files?\njavascript\n while (i<=upa.files.length) {\n    ultimo = upa.files.length;\n    if (ultimo > 1) {\n        if (i > 0) {\n            ultimo2 = ultimo - 1;\n            ii = i-1;\n            if (ultimo2 != ii) {\n                if (up.files[ultimo - 1].name == upa.files[i-1].name) {\n                    up.removeFile(file);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    i++;\n}\nPlupload 2 has this filter built-in now, set prevent_duplicates to true.\n. Cannot repeat it in Chrome or FF or IE. Maybe it occurs for specific files only?\n. Finally updated the nightly build with the fix for this one.\n. There's no way to detect if browser can handle it or not, it simply hangs or dies. So in the latest nightly I've added a constraint on the resolution that can be handled (thumbnail or resize) without a problem - 6500x6500 (in theory it's around 8000x8000, but safer to have it much lower).\n. When I re-opened this issue I thought I understood the problem, but now that I actually check it I cannot see it. There seem to be no duplicate previews or hidden previews on big images...\n. Tnx, for such detailed report! Turned out something more intricate than it seemed :| I'd suggest that you use a fresh UI file rather than the one with your temp fix.\n. We've moved i18n to Transifex. It's cleaner and easier to maintain that way. You can sign-up and request a membership in a group for a specific language.\n. Ukrainian language has been imported here.\n. We've removed that phrase completely, since we were not using it anyway.\n. One extra UploadProgress is fired on FileUploaded internally, just to make sure that user receives at least one UploadProgress event (if upload is too fast none might fire naturally). Otherwise we do not hold the process in anyway and fire FIleUploaded as soon as load event is received by html5 runtime.\n. Showing and hiding flash object has various undesired consequences, I need to try that specific scenario though to tell you for sure. On the other note, you can invoke refresh() method to re-position the Plupload when you open the popup.\n. The only case when I was able to replicate this, was with a hidden parent container. Hidden flash component is basically a non-existent one, so this is obviously a wrong scenario. If possible you should avoid hiding Plupload structures. There was a time when such action even resulted in re-initialization of the component, causing the lost of all data that was kept inside.\n. I'd recommend upgrading to 2.x branch.\n. Plupload 2 + FF22 on Mac, XP and v7 works ok here. Might be something subtle. Can you link your case @srissel, @JanKrotky?\n. Mmm... not sure how a server can interfere there...? \nWould be glad to hear how this story ends, no matter what solution you end up with.\n. @JanKrotky, your issue seems to be different - do you execute uploader.refresh() after you show UI Dialog? Showing/hiding Plupload structures is potentially problematic, that's why we have that method in there in first place.\n. @srissel serious investigation there!.. although not sure if we should fight this... or how :|\n. To everybody in this thread, this issue doesn't seem to be a typical case, it would help if you arrange online examples, for us to look deeper into.\n. Will close this for now.. I was writing release notes for that build specifically for you right now :) but seems I'm late. Dramatical difference from the previous build is that we decided to drop the \"new\" chunk format. After some thinking I came to a conclusion that all benefits that it brought can be achieved using the previous format with some re-ordering in upload handler (some rewrite was still required with the new format anyway).\nIt is not completely gone however, simply not default anymore. You can re-activate it by setting send_chunk_number to false (true by default now). E.g.:\njavascript\nvar uploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n    chunk_size: \"200kb\",\n    send_chunk_number: false,\n    ...\n});\nAnd I will beware to alter the logic in future. Sorry for inconvenience. Try it and check if error will go away.\n. The only real benefit (and the main reason for the change) was that new format allowed to write chunks at a specific offset, rather than simply appending them to the end of temp file. That made possible retrying of particular chunks for example, or potentially introducing support for simultaneous chunk uploads (when chunks may arrive in arbitrary order). But all of this can be achieved with the old format as well by simply writing chunks to a separate files and combining into one once upload is complete. S3 does the same I believe.\n. Are you sure you have purged the cache and load it clean? 'cause numbering issue is gone for me after that last fix...\nSecond problem is kind of ugly. That naming format comes from Queue widget - not even sure why it has such format, could be more usable if it was array, with field names like this:\nhtml\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"uploaderme[tmpname][]\" value=\"...\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"uploaderme[name][]\" value=\"...\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"uploaderme[status][]\" value=\"...\" />\nE.g.:\narray(\n   'uploaderme' => array(\n      'tmpname' => array('o_17ung10rsf9r26o1h171bcukcgm.png', 'o_17unf3u2d195r1t84f641k3h1m2ab.png'),\n      'name' => array('Screen Shot 2013-06-29 at 4.38.01 PM.png', 'Screen Shot 2013-04-27 at 5.30.04 PM.png'),\n      'status' => array('done', 'done')\n   )\n)\nWhat do you think?\n. Tnx for your time :)\n. Everything except programmatic triggering of file dialog is exposed, you just need to use Core API, instead of widgets, that are only implementations of it. To start the upload automatically for example after file selection, you should simply call uploader.start() in the listener of FilesAdded event. Etc.\nCore API Reference available here.\n. Ability to trigger file dialog is inconsistent even across the HTML5, check this recent thread for example. But agree it should become available sooner or later.\n. By programmatic triggering we meant triggering of file dialog. If user actually clicks a button, of course browse dialog will appear. In all runtimes. . New beta uses chunk and chunks, you've probably read about it on the forum. Need to update that thread - it's outdated. We decided to keep the format same in the end.\n. Lazy loading is a great idea! Although including a whole lib is probably an overkill in this case. Can't pull that in, but some nice suggestions there - I will bear them in mind. Thanks!\n. Can you post your config?\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/184. You mean you've built it yourself? Or simply used compiled version from js/ folder?\n'cause there was such bug, but it got fixed in: 6f768efda51a2b0fab75cf4f93625934361504a8, but I've not updated compiled versions since then.\n. Hm... you probably have multiple_queues set to false then. But isn't it a logical behavior in this case?\n. I can only replicate the described case with multiple_queues set to false.\n. It might also be a non zero max_file_count, which implicitly sets multiple_queues to false.\n. Yes, logical. No?\n. Not sure what you mean, but you still limit it right?\nmax_file_count was meant to limit number of files uploaded at a single go. If user uploaded less files than the limit, \"single go\" constraint still stays.\n. Do you suggest some alternative?\n. But it kinda ruins the point of multiple_queues=false case, no?\n. multiple_queues=false simply means that user has only one chance to upload anything and if additionally max_file_count is supplied, then user will be able to upload only that many files.\n. What version? 1.5.x? Plupload 2 seems to survive it.\n. We use transifex for language management. Ukrainian language has been added here. You can register and request membership in the corresponding team. In case you care :)\n. Plupload can't be instantiated on a hidden element. The fact that it works on Chrome and FF currently is an exception rather than a rule. However Plupload 2 should work in IE10 as well. We provide a special method: uploader.refresh() that remeasures and repositions the file picker to match the browse button after it finally is shown (not always possible to measure a hidden element). slideDown provides complete callback, you can use it to call refresh() method.\n. What do you mean by \"compress\"?\n. First of all the size of resulting image might differ slightly, specifically for flash it might be bigger than for html5 (it depends on facilities available inside the technology that do a resize).\nAlso quality of 91 is too high to feel the difference, decrease it to 60 for example and try again. You should take into account the fact that if image is already compressed and saved with low quality its size by the end of downsize procedure may actually become larger!\nOtherwise it seems to work here in our unit tests for all runtimes.\n. Can you share the image that you are resizing?\n. Flash resized down to 220kb (from 633kb). HTML5 does better - 192kb. Otherwise it seems ok. What exactly doesn't work in your case?\n. Please set permissions for everyone, 'cause it doesn't let me to download it. \n. Seems to be related to #914. And fixed now. \nTook quite a time to detect the problem :/\n. That link asks for login.\n. If you are resizing and according to your comments - you are, resulting file might be so small and uploads so quick that progress doesn't fire.\nHere: http://jsfiddle.net/cDJhq/2/. Seems to work fine: html5, flash. Try your config and post the updated fiddle back if it doesn't work.\n. Check this ticket: #788. Seems to be the same case. Not exactly a bug.\n. Notice this code chunk from the reference above:\njavascript\n   uploader.bind('PostInit', function(up) {\n        $(\".inline\").colorbox({\n            inline:true, \n            width:\"50%\",\n            onComplete: function() {\n                up.refresh();\n            }\n         }).click();\n    });\nYou do not popup the colorbox until PostInit fires and then you do up.refresh() when colorbox is fully open.\n. First of all there are no thumbs for 1.5.7 and according to swf/xap versions that you use this is the version you are trying (for Plupload 2 they are named correspondingly Moxie.swf and Moxie.xap).\nSecondly for UI you do not need to put events in init object, you can list them directly in the settings, like this:\n``` javascript\n$(\"#imagesUploader\").plupload({\n    // General settings\n    runtimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight',\n    url : 'upload-action.cfm',\n    max_file_size : '6mb',\n    unique_names : false,\n    autostart : true,\n// Specify what files to browse for\nfilters : [\n    {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"}\n],\n\n// Flash settings\nflash_swf_url : 'plupload/plupload.flash.swf',\n\n// Silverlight settings\nsilverlight_xap_url : 'plupload/plupload.silverlight.xap',\n\nstart: function(up) {\n    console.log(\"Upload Began\");\n},\ncomplete: function(up) {\n    console.log(\"Uploads completed\");\n}\n\n});\n```\nAnd third - notice that event names are in lower caps - case matters.\n. It is now.\n. You probably talking about plugin Front End Upload Pro. You should probably post on it's support forum: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/front-end-upload, rather than here.\n. Mention Plupload version and post your config as well, please.\n. I do not observe any such error with 1.5.7, maybe you should consider the upgrade. 1.x files are available here under js/ folder of the 1.x branch.\n. Image previews default to the \"extension placeholder\" only when resolution exceeds maximal supported values (6500x6500). Does it also happen for you on small images?\n. Can't repeat it here.\nFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jayarjo/TumBt/. Can you - on this one?\n. Addressed this in 4ca6cedf1e61e352f63e7e4288dfb749669d5106 (consider Plupload 2 having this in now).\n. Sorry not sure what is the question? Compiled versions are in bin/flash: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/tree/master/bin/flash\n. Plupload.flash.swf is flash component for 1.x branch, while Moxie.swf is that of 2.x. They are not compatible.\n. Feel free to close this topic if your issue is resolved.\n. First of all url : 'ajaxurl' is wrong in any case, 'cause you pass string 'ajaxurl' and not the variable. ajaxurl as JavaScript variable by default is available only in admin pages. And finally - \"what is the correct url?\" is not the main question. Whatever the url, you should still handle the upload somehow on server-side. It's up to you what the url will be.\nIt's more of a WordPress question, rather than Plupload related.\n. DImensions seem ok. It probably fails to manipulate the image itself for one reason or another an bails out.\nCan you post the image?\n. It is namespace for compile time constants that can be set via command-line. Defaults are set in project settings. It's just that the whole thing is Flash Builder project and obviously settings are lost when you import it to a different IDE.\n. I've updated the build with the regression fix. You can also try compiled files from js/ folder.\n. If you are using our UI Widget, then you can push the message through our notify() method. Check corresponding API entry here.\nIt should be invoked in typical UI manner:\njavascript\n$('#uploader').plupload('notify', 'error', \"Something odd has happened\");\n. It is security constraint. Believe it or not. In case you find a resource that states otherwise, let us know. We will be glad to implement it.\nCheers.\n. Yes, got to do it. Not sure if I will include support into the code, but need to clean it a bit to make it easily wrappable.\n. It is.\n. https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1332\n. This features goes into Plupload finally. Thanks to everybody taking time to pull it in.\n. If it happens in html5 (can't repeat in any other runtime) you should know that accept attribute that does the filtering is interpreted too freely in different browsers (who said the war was over?). For example Firefox, while it does take into account that attribute, by default still allows to select any file (unless you explicitly select the recommended type in the dropdown at the bottom of the file dialog). Also check this entry from our FAQ. And this #851 for more information on the problem.\nIn any case, you should not rely on client-side only for file type filtering. It's dangerous to say at least. 'Cause anyone can open dev tools and manually remove the filtering from your page. Then you have a problem.\n. In general plupload has the code inside that will trigger the Error event for the wrong file types and won't add it to the queue. But this happens after user selects the files (any of them).\nTry this fiddle in Firefox for example: http://jsfiddle.net/qzE3L/\n. Works in IE9 here. However getting quite  a lot of JS errors from handler.js in IE8 and below, beginning with this one for example saying \"Function expected\":\njavascript\n if(options.images instanceof window.NodeList){\n      imageNodes = options.images;\n }\nI see a flash component in the DOM, so it gets initialized, but doesn't acquire any dimensions. I'd suggest to comment out handlers.js for the moment and try to load the page without it.\nOtherwise it seems ok.\nLet us know of any results.\n. Ok, thanks for prompt cooperation. Now it loads and gets proper dimensions, so my assumption is partially true. However I get an exception in debugger for the flash itself. I'll try to track it down, while you fix handlers.js :)\n. Right holder.js.... I thought it was a crucial script for your app. Nevermind. Better for you then.\n. Ok. In your plupload config, remove the extra comma in file filters list (IE is very sensible about these):\njavascript\nfilters : [\n    {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,jpeg,gif,png\"}, // <- this one\n]\n. What you mean you can't upload? Does it upload successfully in Chrome (for example)?\n. Well... not exactly... but what I see here in packet tracer, is that upload ends up with this json message:\n{\"code\":200,\"message\":\"ok\",\"url\":\"\\/t2u\\/123456\\/2013\\/08\\/10\\/1376127116.JPG\",\"time\":1376127121,\"image-width\":1936,\"image-height\":1296,\"image-frames\":1,\"image-type\":\"JPEG\",\"sign\":\"70b3c4f9602e47171ffe1096b9549ca8\"}\nDoesn't it mean that upload succeeded?\n. FileUploaded triggers here successfully. Try to refresh the page and type in user and pass manually, rather than copy-pasting it in. I've not tracked the logic behind it, but when I simply copy/pasted it replied with some red exclamation message.\nSo far what I see is not exactly Plupload related, so I'd suggest that you debug it on your side.\n. We've moved our i18n facilities to Transifex. So we do not accept these via pull requests anymore. I've imported your translation over there: Lithuanian language. Thanks ;) If you register on Transifex and join Lithuanian team, I'll get you approved.\n. The problem is that it is not exclusively the single reason for that error.\n. And why the plupload version is wrong? Seems standard. You accept the file on server just the same way you would accept standard html form with the file.\n. You can use file_data_name option to set the file field name to something else than the default file.\n. You could try to add this to your Plupload config:\nfile_data_name: \"productfile[file]\"\nAlthough I might be wrong, since I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve.\n. To make chunking possible we use our own artificial upload method, as default one doesn't allow chunking. But the problem with this is that it doesn't cancel the request immediately so that relatively small chunk can still successfully reach the server. Obviously the only reliable solution to this would be what I've mentioned in #868.\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/57. Started to build one here: Options.\n. max_retries comes into play when there is HTTP error detected. It simply re-sends the same chunk (or file) for specified times, before resulting in the final error.\nchunk_size you are partially right and not so. No matter if you are using chunking or not PHP will still use only amount of memory allowed by php.ini. How much memory will be available for separate processes is a matter of your web-server configuration.\nAdditionally, if PHP ini has a maximum post size (which is normal), I would assume that \nthe upload will fail for any non-chunked file larger than the maximum post size.\nRight. That's what will happen.\n. Finally got it to the end: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Options.\nWriting an entry about all the capabilities now.\n. Actually this issue was one of the main reasons why we've introduced an alternative format for chunking, where instead of sending chunks number and ordinal number of the current chunk, we were sending total files size and the offset of the current chunk in bytes. Then server-side handler would seek in the temp files and insert the chunk at a specific offset, rather than appending it to the end. Actually support for this mode is still in there and can be enabled by setting: send_chunk_number to false. However one would need to alter the upload handler accordingly. Here is how we had it at one time.\nBut in the end we decided to drop it. I guess the same result can be achieved by storing the chunks in separate files inside the temp directory, rather than writing them directly to a single file. Then once they are uploaded, file can be combined and directory deleted. Not that dramatic change in upload handler and still quite simple. I believe that's what Amazon S3 does for its multipart upload mode.\n. This is now addressed in Plupload 2. It will simply allow selection of any file if it cannot map extension to a mime type.\n. We do not accept pull request for languages here. We moved language management to Transifex. You can request a membership in Turkish team and translate it there with a convenient interface.\nHere is the link: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/plupload/language/tr_TR\n. This usually happens when upload url is wrong or doesn't exist. Have you rechecked?\n. Doesn't give error, but does it actually upload  anything?\n. Here's the fiddle you can play with:http://jsfiddle.net/LxRFH/. Does it also give you an error?\n. The code that you referenced was using UI widget.\nCode was rewritten, from the ground up, so - yes - plupload.full.js is completely different. And versions are not compatible. Only interfaces are the same.\n. i18n tools has been moved to Transifex. I've added Simplified Chinese here. You can request membership and edit it from there.\n. Plupload can upload multiple files. Check examples on the site.\n. html4 cannot select more than one file. It uses iframe and constructs the form internally to send the file, which is obviously not possible if multiple file selection is allowed.\n. @meixger, what you describe sound weird. Is this a known browser bug or what do you think?\n. @MatsSvensson I remember replying to this issue... hm. Anyway. Have you tried compiled files from under js/ folder? There was no release, but they should bear the fix.\n. Did you had problem on 2 beta or 1.5.7?\nDirect link to 1.x binaries: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/tree/1.x/js.\n. This is definitely fixed in Plupload 2.x. We will probably stop supporting 1.x branch, once 2.1 is out.\n. The other day I was testing on Android 4.1 and it worked ok. Can you name an exact Android version and Webkit version where this problem occurs?\n. This is not Plupload limitation. It is a general security constraint. You will encounter it even if you are not using Plupload. Your server must have support for it. Here's a nice writeup: Using CORS.\n. Glad you've figured it out!\n. Can this be closed then?\n. What do you mean - \"macro-command\"?\n. Can you suggest an alternative?\n. Wrapper? Is it a best-practice or pattern of some kind for a cases like this, or what do you mean?\n. Check this: Plupload in Your Language.\n. Fixed the link, sorry.\n. Your translation was imported into a Spanish group: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/plupload/language/es/.\n. Still ok here on (FF, Mac OS X, FP 11.8.800.168). Have you tried on other workstations? \n. Now that I try to install FP on IE, I get 11.8.800.174 as the latest version. And I cannot repeat the described problem in IE10  + Win7, IE8 + WinXP (#884, #886). In archived versions 11.8.800.174 is marked as Win IE only, could have been temp glitch of some kind, that has been urgently fixed by Adobe.\n. Before we try anything else try 11.8.800.174, that was released yesterday by Adobe to fix some of Win + IE issues.\n. To have it simple, you can not upload cross-domain in HTML4. Sorry. If you find a way, please share with us.\n. @seasidz, when you have urlstream_upload : true, file will be loaded in memory before uploading. This causes delay and is useless for big files. Especially if you are not using chunking or client-side resizing. I'd suggest removing it.\n. Also Flash runtime in ie6, ie8 should be tested in standalone browsers, 'cause in various emulators similar to multipleIE or IETester - it sometimes hangs.\n. What you mean by status?\nThis: {\"response\":\"{\\\"jsonrpc\\\" : \\\"2.0\\\", \\\"result\\\" : null, \\\"id\\\" : \\\"id\\\"}\"} doesn't affect upload process in any way, it's just an example of how a typical server response may look like. If you are asking about the \"result\": null part of the response, then it's normal and this is what you should get in other browsers as well.\n. You seem to be using Plupload 1.x. status property is not available in Flash and HTML4 runtimes for 1.x branch. If you absolutely need it (as well as normalized error events) try Plupload 2, which is almost ready to be released by now anyway.\n. I'd suggest that you destroy Plupload when you hide modal and recreate it on open. It will be simpler that way. \nAnd upgrade to the latest version.\n. There's uploader.destroy() method.\n. To what version did you upgrade? Current stable version is 1.5.7. If you plan to use 2.0 beta, you need to review bundled examples.\n. It was not possible before. For example WebWorkers didn't support passing resources by reference. But it is planned - yes.\n. Previously it was not worth it. However with the recent improvements it might provide some gain. We still need to experiment to know for sure.\n. Mechanical omission :( HTML5 runtime was meant to have the ability to properly report HTTP statuses. I've updated nightly build now. Thanks for reporting this.\n. Related #884, #886.\n. Original file name is available under file.name. target_name is really only used in conjunction with unique_names or rename options. While in the first case it can be made available on FilesAdded, in the second one - I do not see how it can be done. Why would you want to use target_name when there's a name property? Or at least - why on FilesAdded?\n. Not really a bug I think. Feel free to re-open if you still feel otherwise.\n. iOS 7...\nNew Safari was reported as being the buggiest since version 1.0. Can you check if it works in Chrome on iOS 7? Do not have iOS 7 here to check immediately.\nThanks for letting us know.\n. I meant if you could test it in Chrome on iOS7. \nThanks for update about Android anyway.\n. We've tried it on iOS7 and it seems to upload as expected. Size and progress are properly reported. Etc. Kinda strange. Maybe you guys should provide more details about your implementation. Or maybe even create a fiddle?\n. We tried, to pick up a video directly from cam and it reported the size as usual. Are we talking about stored videos?\n. We need ios7 device to investigate it deeper. Quick test on one of the iphones from a friend of mine didn't show any problem. So it might be something picky.\n. Do you mean it is possible to go to the store and debug it right there in the devtools?\nWell... there are no such stores here anyway.\n. I'll get my hands on ios7 device today and check it finally.\n. @kenmeyers @nikitazu @chimerafun \nSo are your issues indeed gone when you set multi_selection to false?\n. Addressed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/346e7322030bc393a801e208809eccbffc78eea3\n. Glad you like it.\nI'm not sure what you are trying to do, but at the very least uploader variable from the second call will replace the one from the first, in case you output it onto the same web page.\n. Yes, but not out of the box. One would need to alter upload handler to store chunks in separate files and do some communication about the chunks with the client-side on request.\nI'm working on a class encapsulating some of these features here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload-handler-php (not as part of Plupload though). \n. We do not have a special method for this (although I should probably arrange one), but as the Plupload starts to upload the file it takes into account file.loaded property. So simply by setting this property to the specific offset in bytes would make it to start from there. You can do this either before you call uploader.start() or on BeforeUpload event.\n. Thanks for the report. Important one!\n. slice() is pretty wide-spread nowadays and is recommended way to deal with uploading of huge files in html5. For Flash it is opposite. Here is a summary of some complications around the topic: When to use chunking and when not?\n. Silverlight handles it properly though.\n. Addressed now among other things in 610399a5fe220384ad71dddab957a360bf2b5cb3.\n. Fixed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/2c5ebd218ad7163aa74a9c1a72afdee751ca96f7\n. You are right loading and uploading at the same time is prohibited by the Flash itself. It can do only one such operation at a time. Maybe we should properly result this into an error of some kind. Although not sure what will be the best way here.\nSuggestions are welcome.\n. Simply wait until thumbnails are shown (if you are showing them manually there are actual events to listen to - resize and embedded), and then start your upload.\n. Addressed in https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/d43aa678b9d26ec28424456f3664c01aec7c816c. Basically error should not happen anymore. Queries will wait for each other to complete before proceeding any further.\n. Dont' you think that #903 is related to this problem? Since in a simple case usage scenario I can't repeat the problem here. The actual IE9 never picks up HTML5.\n. What iOS version?\niOS7 seems to have a bug, where it doesn't trigger onchange event on input[type=\"file\"] if it has multiple attribute.\n. Addressed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/346e7322030bc393a801e208809eccbffc78eea3\n. Current solution to this is that we simply disable multiple file selection in iOS7, until they address it somehow.\nSuggestions are welcome.\n. It is not only about image.jpg. In iOS7 onchange event simply doesn't fire when file input has attribute multiple on it. What version of iOS is on your iPhone?\n. They've probably fixed it in 7.0.4. Will put a conditional in there.\n. And what is the code that you try?\n. @martinbooth, merged it. @jonyo, @valmont does it fix the problem for you? I still do not have access to any Windows 8 device.\n. Nice.\n. Otherwise it will violate same origin policy. Port matters. Why do you think it is weird? Do you specify an absolute upload url?\n. It only puts in the port for relative urls - at least this was the intention. It doesn't touch absolute urls. If that's what it does then it's ok and this ticket can be closed. Otherwise it is probably a bug that needs to be addressed.\n. Fixed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/c3ade1b72cda544c6fcc91990ffb9d1ab956ad65\n. Thanks for detailed report. Actually it definitely lacks a proper definition there. You are right. Nice work.\n. Would be helpful if you could post your code at least. Actually we do not observe anything like that in any of the systems that you mention.\nOr better Create a Fiddle.\n. Examples on the site accept images only I believe and do a client-side resize on them, so that final files become very small - this might be a reason for the the instant progress update.\nOtherwise I've tried Plupload 2 on Windows 8, IE10 and didn't notice any issues with progress. Works as expected. Plupload 2 is the version that we recommend to be used. 1.x branch is being deprecated now.\nHere, try this one for example: http://jsfiddle.net/xGw2N/ (in the end it throws HTTP error, since upload url is faked, but progress is real).\n. My local VM with Win8+IE10 got screwed, so I had to test online via Sauce. Now, when I open the test page using their Sauce Connect (that's how they proxy local urls to be available for their browsers) I was able to reproduce what you have described. Progress instantly went to 100% and file appeared much much later. But when I uploaded test page to our public servers and turned off their proxying thing, the glitch went away.\nCould that be that in your case something similar has happened?\n. Use CDN version of the flash shim. Here: Moxie.cdn.swf. Regular one has a security constraint, that doesn't allow this.\n. Yep, probably. Never came to me that this might be an issue.\n. Do you have ssh keys set up? It should not have been a problem I think if you had them.\n. Merged.\n. No - it's a bug. It got fixed in the core, so will make itself into the next minor update. Thanks for reporting.\n. Fixed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/c3ade1b72cda544c6fcc91990ffb9d1ab956ad65\n. It got fixed and then broken again. Here the commit that fixes it: d250979f71157e4af1954b40027e6e258fff21b6. It will get merged into the 2.1.\n. Yes, that seems the commit that causes the problem. Fixed now in https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/c99bd53fc5ab4e0df452d138bfcab530b514d36c\n. Post your code please.\n. Are you sure you generate a proper policy? Try to remove: success_action_status:\"200\" and urlstream_upload:true.\n. Looking at the request/response headers now I see that Flash stopped sending Filename field along with the default upload request, which is simultaneously good and bad. And in your case even more confusing. So I need to expand the explanation a bit.\nTake a look at our bundled s3 example and notice that up until recently we had to take into account one extra field - Filename, that was silently sent out by Flash. Now it is not required anymore (after we targeted FP 11.3 as minimal version), so if you remove it from policy and from multipart_params - the whole thing will start to work again.\nBut!.. Looking at your code above I see that in your case it is actually an opposite situation. You are not taking into account implicit Filename field and at the same time are using the old compilation of Moxie, that requires it. So you either need to do as we demonstrate in the s3 example that I've mentioned previously, or you need to download the latest swf from here on github (js/Moxie.swf). \n. Any update on this?\n. If it works fine with Filename, then what I said above is true. Copy/paste the example and build on top of it, rather than editing your version. You are probably missing something.\nAlso be sure to check this tut: Upload to Amazon S3.\nI'm considering various options of how to make a consistent change to the code, so that it could work everywhere.\nWhat is your Flash Player version?\n. Interesting. Then the latest swf shouldn't even work on your side... 'cause it is compiled for 11.3 (as a minimal version).\n. No, no changes. It works properly on Windows and Mac, I need to get an Ubuntu VM I guess.\n. I've retried now to make sure and it works on Mac OS X and Windows. We had an omission in our bundled S3 example (corrected in: 509d6b7f8e67d6849bb77d79c01551d530f50ba7). It definitely was confusing, maybe that's what is causing the error for you?\n. I finally got my hands on Ubuntu VM with latest Chrome and FP 12 (for some reason I thought 11.2 was the last one) and it works there too. So it might be something with your code. If you post it (without credentials info) I could troubleshoot it further.\n. I'm closing this issue now, 'cause it is definitely not happening for us. And is misleading in general. Notice this line here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/examples/jquery/s3.php#L91 - it is still required and you lack it. Probably that's what happening.\n. @geshub, what exactly do you mean? support for file uploading was added in iOS6.\n. Let us know if you detect any particular devices or browsers having the problem. Generic reports do not exactly help in troubleshooting the issue...\nFor example @orassayag reported an error in IE, but it turned out it wasn't Plupload originated. And chunking was never possible in Chrome 6.0 and Safari 5.1.7, when using html5 runtime.\n. @orassayag is this one resolved now?\n. @geshub I can't tell you without seeing your code.\n. @orassayag it is bug of your implementation.\n. I've started plupload-demos recently that use jsFiddle as a platform for client-side demos. One big drawback is that there is no server-side part involved, since it is a third party service. But any user facing features, as well as runtime initialization can be tested just fine.\nIn the end I will probably have to build our own playground.\n.  'mOxie' is undefined can be caused only by mOxie being undefined... \nAre you sure Plupload scripts are included and ready by the time you open it in fancybox? Can you show the actual code?\n. I don't think we can make it accessible, but we can automatically add some special class to the dropzone on dragenter and drop, like: plupload-dragenter and plupload-drop.\nWill that help?\n. We do not throttle drag and drop events in 2.1.2 anymore.\n. Try updated binaries from under js/ folder here, directly on github.\n. Accepted :)\nAlthough there are some here in the github wiki (description for filters object and tut about uploading to S3 among them): https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/readme.md\n. Can you put more information in your reports?\nASCII CODE:\nGettin-&-#-0-3-9-; and not ' like it shows here.\nWhat that should mean?\nYou can set unique_names to true in your config and Plupload will auto-generate unique filenames without any special characters.\n. Ok you probably mean &#039; - code for a single quote. Probably your server auto escapes single quotes as they are considered a potentially malicious characters.\nMaybe you should look deeper into your code and technologies in general, rather than reporting everything here as Plupload issue?\n. Call uploader.refresh() on it, after you open a dialog - it needs to reposition the shim. Not a bug, just an expected drawback of 1.x branch :(\nI suppose you are not using Plupload 2?\n. Post your config at least.\n. This is how we manage translations these days: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Plupload-in-Your-Language. Would be great if you could submit the correction there.\n. This is actually a \"feature\". Kinda. Serves to save the memory and resources in general when tab is not active or Flash object is not visible. While there's no viable workaround, it shouldn't be a problem in general. Upload should proceed. The only thing being affected should be a feedback from the object, that is going to drop noticeably from around 60 fps to like 2 fps.\nIsn't it what you observe? Does it really stop or it stops to update the progress bar?\n. It cannot be disabled. It is how browsers and flash player in them work today. If flash player is out of the viewport (like has been scrolled down out of the view) or resides on inactive tab it will be throttled. If you consider this a bug you should probably file it on Adobe's issue trackers.\nBut as I said above it doesn stop uploading. Upload still happens. What is paused is real-time feedback. If your file doesn't upload then you should look elsewhere.\n. How long was the site down? We host it in the cloud and it should be like 99.9% up :(\n. Ehm... I have it open in a separate tab occassionally... I would have noticed that. Maybe it's a connection from you to there or something?\nBut it's strange and shouldn't be happening in general. I will recheck.\n. Check the thread here: #905. I'm afraid there's no solution until they fix that bug.\n. Do you want to upload the same files or new ones? Try to set multiple_queues to true in your configuration. Widget will get reset automatically after each upload cycle.\n. And where do you upload that file? Do you have a local web-server running on your windows machine?\n. Sorry I'm not sure what do you do there. Do you upload to Azure Storage Blob, then download back from there and try to open in Microsoft Office?\n. Btw, you should not be using Plupload 1.x anymore.\n. Ok, let me clarify this a bit further. So you have file (Office Document), you upload it to Azure Blob. Let's say it has uploaded successfully and is stored there. Then you try to open that file (the one that is still on your workstation) and you encounter that error?\nDo you encounter the same problem while uploading in general, not to Azure, but to a regular server for example?\n. In Silverlight it might happen due to an open handle (if for some reason it doesn't get freed), but in HTML5 there's nothing to close - are you sure you are getting this error with the HTML5 as well? Maybe try to remove Silverlight from the list completely (leave only html5) and see if it repeats.\n. Why do use \"old upload\" for html4?\n. I thought maybe you are having problems with our html4 runtime...\n. Can you provide a fiddle with the case?\n. Ehm... actually I forgot that jsFiddle is unusable in IE8 and less... they probably dropped support for those browsers at once.\n. Currently it seems operational. But just in case if you or anyone else would need to file a report and provide a fiddle that works all the way down to IE6, we have our own playground now: http://play.plupload.com.. How did you incorporate the fix from #939. Have you built plupload yourself?\nCan you post the final settings object here? 'cause the code here looks like it has missing pieces...\njavascript\nvar settings = {\n    browse_button:        'attach-button-2',\n    drop_element:         'composeForm',\n    max_file_size:        attach.totalSpace + 'b',\n    url:                  'compose.php?actionID=attachFile',\n    flash_swf_url:        '/assets/mail/swf/moxie.swf',\n    silverlight_xap_url:  '/assets/mail/swf/moxie.xap',\n    init: {};\nThis one lacks closing curly bracket?.. \nAnyway with the settings object like this one I properly get html4 in my unit test. It might be something with your implementation or the way you've combined sources maybe?..\n. I should probably add that I get html4 for the runtime order like this: html4,flash,silverlight,html5.\n. @ibrahimijk are you maybe trying to upload  to a different domain? html4 (the one having the problem in your screenshot) doesn't support cross-origin requests. And html5 doesn't work in IE <= 9, that's why there is a flash runtime in first place.\n. And just in case try to use binaries from here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/tree/master/js. They are more fresh.\n. You can't just upload like that across domains. For flash you must have crossdomain.xml on server-side. For html5 you need to send special http header from the server. \nAlthough this is beyond the Plupload competence, I will probably write a wiki entry about it - seems to be confusing point for many. Until then you can familiarize yourself with the concept here: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/.\n. Here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#wiki-how-do-i-upload-to-a-page-on-a-different-domain-host\n. Doesn't screen9 have a way to support additional form fields sent with the file? name field historically was always sent by Plupload, although I consider to limit its usage to the cases when it is actually required.\n. Flash silently sends its own version of the name parameter - Filename and there seems no way to remove it. I wonder how do they deal with this one.\n. Has been addressed in https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/4f4b88f806411bd6b91437b1fba06b210fb21eea. But name argument is still sent by default (for sake of backward compatibility). To avoid default behavior one can set send_file_name option to false.\n. How do you filter? Post your code please.\nFile filtering in html5 still quite differs from browser to browser and is not consistent, to say at least. For example while Firefox provides filtering, by default it still lets you select any file, unless you choose specific file type from the type dropdown at the bottom of the file select dialog.\n. How is this different from: #938?\n. Maybe, but the sprintf thingy is not a real sprintf anyway and was added after that string has been established in i18n. We can't just change it cause it affects all language packs. And not that crucial anyway.\n. Fixed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/4d7a22e2e0deef89438b0236448efd9533f7af78.\nRegex split not a cross-browser method after all...\n. Try updated binaries from under js/ folder on GitHub and see if the problem repeats.\n. Post your config here.\n. In my test here with your config it is not a case. Maybe purge your cache making sure that you run the latest version from here on GitHub?\nBtw:\n...\n   silverlight_xap_url: 'Scripts/plUpload/Moxie.xap',\n});\nextra comma there in the end of config - IE8- killer.\nAlso you should run uploader.init() before you attach any other events than Init.\n. When chunking is actually enabled, flash does it differently a bit, since default upload method (used by Flash itself) doesn't let you slice the file or access its internals in general. A bit different means that it uses our artificial upload method that is better in multiple ways, but as drawback doesn't have a way to let you know about the progress. So its one or the other. Both methods suck in some way, but that's what you have in Flash. Delay is caused by the fact that Flash needs to read the whole thing in memory first - this is the price of chunking in Flash. So if you are not going to upload huge files, I'd suggest that you turn the chunking off.\nI'm considering various options here to handle it more predictive way, but non of them is ideal. For example one is to ignore the chunking for Flash only, unless it is explicitly requested via required_features option.\n. You should not enforce chunking for Flash environment, since it does exactly opposite to what you are trying to achieve by enabling chunking. Flash works best without chunking.\nCheck our writeup about When to Use Chunking and When Not.. Hmm... interesting. \n. Thanks for bringing the point to the light :)\n. Do you pick the image from library or take it from camera? What is your Android version?\n. I do not have 4.0.3, but on 4.1.1 everything seems to be ok.\nBtw, you configuration seems to be a mix of both 1.x and 2.x branches. You need to switch it completely to either one or another. Plupload 2 doesn't support Gears and BrowserPlus anymore so you can remove them from the runtimes list. Also you need to rename the shims to Moxie.swf and Moxie.xap correspondingly.\n. Managed to try it on 4.0.4 emulator. Seems to be ok as well.\nFeel free to reopen this ticket with more details.\n. Sorry. This issue tracker here is for Plupload issues. This doesn't seem one. Maybe you should ask it on jQuery forums or on StackOverflow\n. You mean Failed to move uploaded file. ?\nTheres no reason for tiff to not be uploaded. It is true that only jpegs and pngs are treated as images (resized on client-side if requested for example, etc), but Plupload can upload any file, be it tiff or anything else.\nMaybe check if your server can accept files that big (tiffs can be very large). Try to upload small tiff and see if it makes through.\n. Yes. It is quite trivial actually. Post your config. And maybe try to upload a file of some other type (movie for example) comparable in size with tiff.\n. I think you should check upload_max_filesize and post_max_size in your php conf. They should be large enough to accept your files. Check here.\n. Yes. Read this one: Chunking.\n. I guess that's how Firefox understands the accept attribute...\n. accept attribute accepts only mime types (excluding the recent Chromes that accept extensions as well), so the extensions are internally translated to mime types (where possible). Otherwise the whole filtering thing (via the accept attribute) will be of no use in Firefox.\n. I think that they do not consider it as issue.\n. What kind of error? Try compiled binaries from under js/ folder. They are fresher.\n. @aik099 drag and drop issue in Win8 + IE10 doesn't seem to occur: http://jsfiddle.net/a6awH/.\n. @aik099 the same for Windows 7... Maybe you are dragging it to a wrong element (for some reason your Select Files button is not functional)?\n. I'm downloading IE9 VM now, do not have it here.\n. The error like this gets triggered when Flash component gets disabled, due to one reason or another. If its display rule is set to 'none' for example, or of its container.\nCan you post the css that you use on the page - for complete picture.\n. Ok, glad it helped.\n. That part was historically used as a feature. By binding event listeners before init() one could override internal handlers. \nWe emphasis it everywhere that one should bind to event listeners after init(), unless he knows what he is doing.\nSo... not a bug.\n. Sorry for late response again... \nThis shouldn't be happening with the latest binaries, is it?\n. Flash or Silverlight do not function when they are hidden. That's just how they work, or perhaps how they do not work. And you should call uploader.refresh(); after you show/hide or reposition the browse button. That's the whole point of that method.\n. Sorry not sure what you mean by \"full postback\".\n. It doesn't happen to me on mac. But in general is it something you encounter on a real server too? It used to happen for old browsers (IEs especially) when 'Content-type: application/json' header was explicitly sent from server (something that jsfiddle does I guess). If you are planning to use html4 and send json response from server, I'd suggest that you avoid sending this header. If you absolutely need to send something, send 'Content-type: text/json' instead.\n. Can't repeat it here. Actually the case that I've described above is the only one where I've observed such behavior. It doesn't postback anything. It simply interprets your json result as file and asks you to download it.\n. Tnx for letting us know. Seems like some kind of issue in our cloud service ... :|\n. Silverlight shouldn't work in Opera in general, since they are not compatible...\nCan you mention Plupload and Opera versions? And post your config.\n. You shouldn't be uploading such big files without chunking. Browsers still do not handle it properly. So always enable chunking if you are planning to upload files that big. But do not include Flash in your runtime list, since it can't chunk big files.\n. aac seems to be ok in Chrome 31.x. What is the version where you encounter this?\n. Hm... and what is OS?\n. 10.9.1 here.\nNot sure what we can do about it. When I replace audio/aac with audio/mpeg, aac files become gray... Does it work on your side with audio/mpeg?\n. One could also use our mOxie.Env structure to sniff out the browser, os and their versions to enable this workaround. Although we definitely cannot implement that in the core. Maybe I should simply remove aac from the map.\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/964\n. It is fixed in main branch. You can download updated binaries from under js/ folder.\n. Are you trying our widget or self-made implementation? And what version of Plupload?\n. Maybe put the browse_button element into a separate container and pass it (container) as a value for container option in your config.\n. Did it help?\n. Ok :)\n. Check Plupload in your language.\n. @PeterDaveHello I would like to include it but even if I accept it, it will be automatically removed on the next build. It is very easy to create Transifex account. I personally tried to create the group for you, but while there is a number of available Chinese groups there's no entry for Tradition Chinese.\n. Here is the list of available Chinese groups on Transifex (separate group for each language variant I guess):\n\nChineseChinese (China) (GB2312)Chinese (Gan)Chinese (Hakka)Chinese (Hong Kong)Chinese (Huizhou)Chinese (Jinyu)Chinese (Literary)Chinese (Mandarin)Chinese (Min Bei)Chinese (Min Dong)Chinese (Min Nan)Chinese (Min Zhong)Chinese (Pu-Xian)Chinese (Taiwan)Chinese (Taiwan) (Big5) Chinese (Wu)Chinese (Xiang)Chinese (Yue)\n\nNot sure which one is considered Traditional...\n. I've created a group and imported your translation here. Once you create the account you can request the membership in the group and I will add you as maintainer.\n. Did you follow the guide over here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Upload-to-Amazon-S3 ?\n. Ok, first get the updated binaries from under js/ folder here on github. Then take the bundled s3 example as the base and adapt it to your needs. I've tried it here and it definitely works in IE8.\n. Post your config then, including policy and plupload initialization code.\n. We had an omission in our example, sorry. Maybe that was causing your error as well. Fixed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/509d6b7f8e67d6849bb77d79c01551d530f50ba7\n. It is not a regress. Check https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/905.\nWhat version of iOS is on your iPhone?\n. Files on github are fresher. We are going to release 2.1 sometime this week.\n. 2.1 is bugfix release. Quality improvement is scheduled for 2.2.\n. Are you sure you include them in proper order (first - plupload.full.js and then jquery.ui.plupload.js)?\n. Sorry, can't repeat it here. And it doesn't make sense in general. Can you provide a failing example online or via fiddle? Does it happen for a specific browser?\n. Looks like flash component either doesn't exist or is hidden in your case. Could you describe your scenario or perhaps post a code?\n. I do not have IE7 here at the moment, but it works properly in IE6. Do you manipulate uploader or it's container in anyway? Maybe you're hiding it or something.\n. But why would you put your function call into the widget's code? Can't you simply hook up onto FileUploaded event?\nYou didn't mention that you are using the Queue Widget btw. And I should say that we do not support custom tweaks to the source in general.\n. Try to include the dev versions (non-minified ones - they come with the package) at least to get more meaningful reference to the troubled line in the code.\n. Remove chunk_size option and see if it affects anything.\n. Errors from minified files are not exactly descriptive, if you could include non-minified versions of the scripts (they also come in package: moxie.js and plupload.dev.js), that could be more helpful.\n. Also in your case - since you have tampered original files. It would be better if you post a link to your case online, so that I could see what is actually happening.\nWe do not observe any such errors in IE8 on our side.\n. This is not helpful. You either organize a test case online with dev versions of the scripts, or we won't be able to troubleshoot this. It doesn't have to be your actual website. Just a case, failing with the error that you mention. Sorry.\n. Yes. It is.\nI should have put it out with updated site, but might not handle it during holidays. So there you have it: http://plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=4123.\n. TypeError: o is null\nMost probably means that library doesn't even load. Are there any other errors in the console?\n. You probably have multiple_queues set to false or have a max_file_count filter activated. This inconsistency was addressed in: 3474609871358301b5bc0340881d964a7f25e203 and will be included in 2.1.2.\n. Are you having that bug with an actual Queue Widget? Can you reproduce it on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gbLyN/?\n. The bug from that thread was definitely fixed. Retried now just in case with the configuration from provided fiddle and it picks up the proper mode. What makes you think otherwise?\nIf you still get the browser mode (this is what we call it; the other one is client mode). Maybe you request some features that default one (client) doesn't support. Along with chunking these might also be client side image resizing or sending of custom http headers.\nIf you provide your actual configuration I can tell you for sure what mode will be picked up.\n. You cannot upload anything from jsfiddle itself, especially in Flash (since they do not even provide a crossdomain.xml on their servers). But if you try locally you will see that it works as expected.\n. You nailed it.\n. Version of Plupload that is used on Example pages at the moment is old and deprecated. Better test on one of the bundled examples from the 2.1 package.\n. Unfortunately jsfiddle doesn't work for old IEs: https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-issues/issues/450.\nWebsite has been updated now, and examples upgraded to Plupload 2.1.\n. What exactly doesn't work?..\nSite wasn't optimized for old IEs, sorry for that. It mostly is now (I've dropped out from IE6 though). Otherwise everything seems to be working ok. Flash/Silverlight do not load for you 'cause you probably do not have them in that browser. N/A in HTML4 is ok, 'cause HTML4 has no idea what the file size is and no tools to get it.\n. Hm...awkward. Nice notice there.\nNo I'm afraid it is not coming to pluploadQueue. Why do you like a styling of pluploadQueue?\n. It's probably because you hide the flash object. It's hidden on the screenshot. I've not encountered any other reason throughout the whole existance of that func in Plupload.\n. And why would you want to remove it? \nAnyway this is wrong place to intervene, as it obviously comes from another place. And if you are using Plupload, then that's where it originates.\n. Additional multipart field name was historically sent from Plupload with the file name, original one or renamed (on client side). It is also handy when file is sent in chunks (the only way to tell the server what the file name really is). If you have to list to your web service the names of all the fields that are sent with the file, you can add that single name field to the list and it should work.\n. Not a bug in general. Although I'm planning to reduce its usage to only those cases where it is required.\n. This one is related: #943.\n. I can't fix 1.5.7, but I made a \"new\" release in 1.x branch: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/releases/tag/v1.5.8. If you download it from github now, it will have only useful and required files.\n. You have to set multiple_queues to true in addition to max_file_count filter.\n. I've approved it :)\n. This has been addressed here: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/93de27bc4c2afce9f3f793f3b2d854948fb7835f\n. What do you mean by calling dynamically?\n. You want to call uploader that resides in a.aspx from b.aspx?\nIt sounds as generic JavaScript task, how is this Pluploads issue?\n. You should call uploader.refresh() when fancybox is loaded and shown. There's afterShow callback in fancybox. good place to try.\n. Set a timeout in onComplete handler, for example:\nsetTimeout(function() { uploader.refresh(); }, 100);\n. It is disabled by default.\n. Yes.\n. @orassayag in what browser on what os? Can you share the file that you are dropping and which gives you that error?\nBtw, files under js/ folder are generated, so modifying them is not exactly useful...\n. Can you post an example of file name at least? We do not encounter any such error here. There's an issue reported: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/pull/61, but it occurs to files with special characters in their names and no error is thrown in that case. File is simply ignored.\n. This might be related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/pull/983\n. So again what is OS and can you share a typical file that has that problem?\n. It doesn't occur to me in the latest build (2.1), Windows 7, Chrome 31 (32 is not yet available on Sauce).\n@JFOC could you possibly try as well?\n. It got fixed in a commit above. Preparing bugfix release now.\n. Version 2.1.1 contains the fix. You can download it from Plupload website.\n. Maybe it's better to remove it from policy. Hm... weird that we have it like that - I remember removing it from both places.\nPolicy should definitely match.\n. UI Widget doesn't have splice method.\n. Thanks for the inquiry. It feels better now.\n. Seems to work for me - HTML5, Flash. It says it is based on WebKit so there should be no problem at all. Can you describe your problem in more detail?\nDo the examples on plupload.com fail for you (http://plupload.com/examples/)? What Plupload version are you using? Post the initialization code.\n. It is not enough. Btw I do not see where you include the flash shim (you got the flash runtime in your runtimes list). And does it work in other browsers, like Chrome?\nPlease answer to my questions in my previous comment fully.\nfile-upload-container should be btn-story-upload-images's parent. Otherwise depending on your surrounding structures it might lead to unexpected results.\n. Great.\nBtw Plupload 2.x will default to an immediate parent of the browse_button element for the container option if you do not specify it.\n. I've never envisioned such usage scenario, but you could try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mx3tG/.\n. Queue Widget doesn't have such functionality, but it can be extended in similar way. Although we do not provide any guides of how to do this at the moment.\n. Empty files are ignored. One big reason for this, for example, was that IE11 had a problem with them. Why would you need to upload empty files anyway?\n. I'd suggest that you look at it from different angle first. Maybe you can find a better solution that doesn't require uploading an empty file.\n. That's quite an investigation there actually. I will look into it. Thanks for your time and efforts.\n. They are not the same, but they were both fixed in that commit, unless I do not understand something in your bug reports in first place.\nI had to modify your pull request a bit, so it's not exactly what you wrote, but I retained your authority on it.\n. That message is formatted only there. \nAnd - yes, one commit - one problem - always better. I just decided that it's maybe be not that dramatic to have them separate.\n. Do you attach your event listeners before or after you invoke uploader.init()?\n. Can you describe the case when having url option as a function might be useful?\n. Is this a requirement by Rackspace that each url should be different for every file?\nThere is some problem with the version of the flash shim on github, simply try the one from the package.\n. mOxie has to be custom compiled to include only specified runtimes and included before plupload.min.js. You only need to compile JS files, available Flash and Silverlight binaries will work just fine. And maybe you do not need to include image manipulation logic.\n. Can you provide examples of typical Rackspace URLs? \nIn general it should be possible to simply change url option through uploader.setOption('url', newUrl). Possibility to set HTTP method however is nice, but only possible in HTML5 - Flash and Silverlight restrict it to GET and POST only.\n. Currently concurrent uploads are not supported. But if they were I do not see how setting url via uploader.setOption can be a problem. It can be set on BeforeUpload which is invoked (as well as UploadFile) for each file separately. \nIs X-HTTP-Method-Override supported by Rackspace? S3 doesn't support it for example.\n. I'm not against such pattern in general, it's nice. It's just that it may lead to confusion in this particular case.\nAmazon is considering X-HTTP-Method-Override for couple of years already... :) And btw, you can easily add custom headers via headers option, so there should be nothing standing in the way, if they were supporting it. In the case of Flash however the drawback is that its default upload method doesn't let you to send custom HTTP headers, so you would need to use our custom one, which requires the file to be loaded in memory first (so obviously not usable in the case of files larger than several hundreds of megabytes).\n. @wuservices can't you do it with the approach that I described above - through BeforeUpload? One could even return false from the listener to delay the upload, acquire all required information, alter the options and then manually trigger UploadFile event on the same file (e.g. uploader.trigger('UploadFile', file), where file is the same file object that he received in BeforeUpload handler as a second argument).\n. Apparently jQuery iterates over object properties and methods and tries something but fails. I think you should iterate over the files array yourself and take only those properties that you require. That's what you should do in general. Blindly sending out object is a bad practice. In coming releases our internal file object will get even more complex. We never guaranteed that it will be simple and flat. Some serious logic is going to be encapsulated inside it in future.\nHaving said that, I will probably consider adding toObject() method, to simplify the process.\n. This is not the right place to edit language files. Check this: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Plupload-in-Your-Language.\nBut why - what is the problem with this file in general?\n. Originally the whole thing was introduced to save the bandwidth, then we've added a crop. Server still can do much better for any other more advanced usage cases. Even bicubic done on client-side takes some additional time in comparison with server and is not exactly faultless. So we are kinda on crossroads for this feature right now.\nWhy do you think it might be useful for example?\n. This thread might be of some help: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1005 (do not miss a fiddle example over there). Plupload doesn't have an access to those images but it's underlying core - mOxie can. Be sure to check the API here: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/wiki/Image.\n. It is more likely that we will implement bilinear and bicubic resampling in 2.2, rather than not. And then we probably can do a viable upsampling as well. I guess people expect it anyway, even if it won't be used that frequently.\n. I'm refactoring image resizing now. Cannot promise that will implement this one, but I will bear it in my mind.\n. This has been implemented in 2.3.1 (although now we get requests to remove upscale).. Are you sure there's no cache involved or something? It definitely works here.\n. Works in Win8.1 + IE 11.0.9600.16384.Shouldn't have changed that dramatically for a mere security fix...\nCan you visit this page: http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ in your IE11 and copy the user agent string here?\n. And could you perhaps post a link to your case if it's online and public?\n. According to the copyright comment in plupload.full.min.js you are still using v2.0.0beta. Make sure you have plupload.full.min.js from the latest package there.\n. \"HTTP error\" usually occurs for the wrong upload url.\n. Drop zone tends to ignore the files that have unlisted extensions. Why do you consider this to be an issue? File input for example grays the unlisted files out or even doesn't show them in the dialog (depending on the browser). Following the logic it should be an issue as well...?\n. @nickvergessen, what would you consider as proper behavior in such case?\n. @nickvergessen, apparently it also should provide the list of files that were stripped...\n. 2.1.2 is out now with the fix.\n. Have you tried our internal max_retries option? I think it does just that.\n. You should set max_retries in settings upon initialization and not on the file.\n. And it doesn't work?\n. I'm not sure why are you checking it on file object, file object doesn't have such property, of course it will be undefined. \n. It should do it automatically if you have max_retries set.\n. Plupload doesn't think that process is fine - if file doesn't get uploaded after specified number of times, Plupload throws an Error event and marks the file as failed. At least that's the intention. Do you experience something different?\n. You can intercept the error, and replace the message with whatever you like.\n. Core error messages are intentionally left so simple. Here is how we enhance them in UI Widget for example: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/src/jquery.ui.plupload/jquery.ui.plupload.js#L431\nAnother reason to leave it like that is that we can't just take a string from the core and change it, since it affects more than 30 translations.\n. Sorry. Rephrase please. It is not clear what exactly you are reporting there.\n. I do not observe any visual glitches on this one for example: http://plupload.com/examples/runtimes (provides instances of all runtimes)...\nCould you provide a case online somewhere? Or at least send a screenshot of the issue?\n. Are you testing it in compatibility mode or an actual IE8? Compatibility mode is often faulty for such tests.\n. How did you manage to install IE8 on win7?\n. Now that's interesting... Could you put your case online, so that we could access it and actually see what is happening there? It might be a combination of some awkward coincidences.\nOn the other hand I'm afraid there's no other way to make the element transparent in IE8.\n. If that helped then you probably have an ultimate css rule on the page that overrides opacity instruction for input[type=\"file\"].\n. NuGet package has been updated to Plupload 2.2.1.. This is not a bug. This is how it worked historically. It is possible to attach event handlers before uploader.init() and after. To intercept all error including initialization ones, or to attach to Init event itself, one should attach event listeners before uploader.init(). But I agree it is quite confusing and I will probably follow your advice for this one.\n. Can you try 2.1.1 first and then if it doesn't help post your initialization code here.\n. Great.\n. We do not accept additions to language packs via pull requests. Sorry. Here: http://plupload.com/docs/Plupload-in-Your-Language\n. And what kind of problem are you facing? It is not packaged for direct installation on Laravel or any other MVC, since it's client-side library. After all there is no package for jQuery right? Or is there? You can include it as a regular JS library and then write an upload handler in a manner suitable for this or that server-side framework.\n. It is security limitation in Flash itself. But usually it is not required, why would you want to click it programmatically? Plupload can be attached to any DOM element, including of course buttons and links, so that when a user clicks it himself, it will trigger the dialog.\n. Simply load the script and initialize the Plupload with regular config (after the Plupload is loaded). Should work just fine.\n. It's complete barebone. So no progress bar bundled in. You can easily do one yourself or use one from jQuery UI or Bootstrap. Simply hook onto UploadProgress event and manipulate the progress visualization with loaded/total ratio.\n. I already got them in, will push the release (2.1.2) out somewhere this week.\n. I will make a release tomorrow. Usage is simple, there are two new options for Plupload UI Widget - thumb_width and thumb_height that control thumb dimensions. Purpose is pretty self-explanatory I guess :)\n. Make sure that you load updated scripts and purge the browser cache maybe.\n. It might be happening if your browse_button element or it's container are hidden or inaccessible. In case of Flash/Silverlight they must visible and have dimensions to work properly. That's security limitation of those technologies.\n. The change that might be affecting your case, was that Plupload structures, and therefore the Flash object is automatically appended to the immediate parent of the browse_button element, if you do not specify any other container for it through the container option.\n. It's runtimes not runtime. So something like this: \njake mkjs runtimes=html5\n. What is the version of Plupload you get this error in (Browser model/version? OS?). I can't repeat in usual scenario. Also in your screenshot I see another problem - thumbs are cropped, which shouldn't be the case. I'd like to see it online if you have it accessible.\n. This might be something tricky. Are you able to repeat the problem in our bundled examples on a standalone page?\nAlso it might help if you'd replace minified scripts with unminified dev versions (they come in the package), 'cause it is not clear where does this error message emerge from.\n. Have you tried putting widget onto a clean page with only plupload scripts and styles on it? I suspect some kind of conflict on the page.\n. Ok. It seems that I was checking against the latest build.\n. That addEventListener is not native, so the problem is elsewhere. If you could post your initialization code, it could help. Have you tried to build from source with the latest code from here on github?\n. Try 2.1.2 update and see if it solves the problem.\n. And what do you think will be right thing to do in such case? Crop the height and leave alone the width (will result in 600x300), or crop/resize to fit the exact dimensions (800x300)?\n. Addressed now in https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/eecec02ff18e114690176bdea92017d73ef9af71.\n. Tnx. Got fixed in: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/commit/73cb368e7ff61b20620e375e2d2ea6499c505ed8.\n. We do not add any extra parameters. Flash - does. I'm afraid there's no way you can get rid of that extra Filename parameter when uploading files in default mode (recommended one, despite all the evils).\n. And what do you have in opts object, is it empty? What you describe is not typical, especially the html5 part having no upload progress. Post the whole chunk of code please.\n. If HTTP status is erroneous Flash is not able to retrieve response body (it is technology limitation). If you need to trigger the error manually you better do it via JSON message or similar.\n. You do not need to have up.start() inside the loop. Otherwise it seems ok in general.\n. I'm not sure if this is worth implementing at the moment. One could easily set the desired timeout himself and then call uploader.stop() manually. Basically that's what I'm planning to do internally if I ever decide to get my hands on this.. This has been addressed now in https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/f5f9a79ea3c1a291a438dfbb1af4dd583702300c.\n. If dimensions in the resize option are bigger, than those of the file (like in your case) - we do not even resize or tamper the image in any way (at least with the options that you have) and upload it as it is.\nCan you provide a typical image where you observe this issue?\n. It does accept id or DOM element, but not via direct assignment. It either should be set in configuration upon init or later through - uploader.setOption(). Apparently not that obvious, sorry. I'm thinking to make uploader.settings inaccessible completely. \n. outerHTML is readonly for some DOM elements only, but definitely not for divs. What is the exact error that you encounter?\n. We do not throttle drag events anymore (https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/5eaff3c61ebed45e31a1dbb92d6dfd32cb678e81) and prevent default behavior only when files are dragged over the dropzone. I guess one could simply attach regular DOM event listeners to the dropzone and make UI to react accordingly.\n. I tried and dragenter and dragleave are in there. Now that we do not throttle these events, whatever happens should be default browser behavior anyway.\n. You can't fix this, unfortunately. This is how these browsers work. Firefox shows all files by default no matter what, but provides a type dropdown below, where you can select particular one.\n. Uploadify is Flash based I think. And we only use Flash when there is no HTML5 support in the browser (as HTML5 is native and has lots of benefits). If you do not want to use HTML5 you can forcefully switch Plupload to use only Flash by setting runtimes option to 'flash':\nruntimes: 'flash'\n. Check how we do it in UI Widget. And you should pass a variable inside filters option, like this:\nfilters: {\n  max_file_count: 3\n}\n. You simply need to make sure that when that filter runs, value of that variable is what you think it is. I bet it works just fine if you set it to the number.. This bug has been fixed, but not yet released. I'll take my time to pack the 2.1.2 finally. It will also have a functional version of max_file_count filter.\n. It is out now. Sorry for delay.\n. I'm afraid you have a mixture of Core API and UI Widget here. In your case you cannot call stop() on uploader object, since it is jQuery object and not the uploader instance. Also there's no stop event in Core API, only UI Widget has it, but even in UI Widget start listener doesn't receive up, file, info as arguments (I'd recommend that you dump the arguments property in a console and see what you get there).\nHere's what you can do instead:\njavascript\n   uploader.bind(\"start\", function(e, o){\n        $.ajax({\n            async: false,\n            type: \"GET\",\n            url: \"/someurl\",\n            success: function(data) {\n                    if(data == \"\")\n                    {\n                        parent.toggle_close(1);\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        alert(data);\n                        o.up.stop();\n                    }\n                }\n        });\n    });\n. Indeed multipart message (and therefore a boundary) might be different depending on the mode in which Flash operates. There are two - default one and our artificial one. We use the latter to send the custom http headers or to resize the image on client side, since default one doesn't support these.\nWhat exactly would you like to remove? That multipart message that you reference seems to be the default one, and you can't really change it in any way.\n. Filename is sent by default by Flash in default mode - you can't really do anything about it. Widespread way to deal with it across the web is simply to take it into account.\nname as I already mentioned in the other thread, is historically sent by the Plupload itself, for various reasons and is sent in both modes.\nYou can switch Plupload to artificial mode by supplying this in config:\nrequired_features: {\n     send_binary_string: true\n},\nAlthough it has it's own drawback and is not recommended to be used with files bigger than couple hundred megabytes.\n. In 2.1.2 it is now possible to keep Plupload from sending name argument by setting send_file_name option to false. But the option will have no effect when multipart is set to false, unique_names is set to true or chunking is enabled.\n. That'd be nice.\n. It strips extra files after you make a selection and close dialog. There's no way to constrain it in browse files dialog itself.. Does it help if set max_retries option to anything other than 0?\n. @kriserickson, @inssein, do you get the same problem on other workstations? I couldn't repeat it, are you maybe working from behind the proxy or is there anything else special about the workstations where you get these errors?\n. I guess we won't be providing this. Pull requests are welcome however.. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1047\n. Could you load unminified versions (they come with the package) and try to repeat the error (exact line will be helpful)? self.window may look weird, but it's ok, since every UI Widget has internal reference to the global window object.\n. Which line does trigger TypeError: el is undefined error? It should be visible in the console. And in what framework are you embedding the Plupload and how?\n. But that's the whole point of Enterprise Mode (I wonder how Microsoft came up with a name like this) - to emulate IE8.\n. What kind of IE8 emulation is that if it supports HTML5 (is it outlined somewhere or is it your guess?). In general we do not rely on browser sniffing, only in rare cases when there is no way to feature sniff the condition. Obviously one of the required features is not supported in Enterprise Mode. That's why it fails. But you could always fallback to Flash or Silverlight runtimes - that's why they were created in first place.\n. Could you post your Plupload initialization code and configuration please?\n. Many thanks for bringing this up. Good investigation there ;)\n. It will only work for Chrome browsers anyway. Not sure why you guys are waiting for so impatiently :) Probably I will simply add a new property to file object that will contain file's relative path within the directory structure and let you guys do the fancy part with it. \n. Ok, I'll rise it's priority to be the first one for 2.1.3.\n. This has been implemented in recent release.\n. Simply set multipart_params via uploader.setOption() when the values are available:\nuploader.setOption('multipart_params', {\n    DataDate: getHiddenDate(),\n    uid: \"<?=$uid?>\",\n    LastUpdated: GetMSSQLdatetime()\n});\n. And please use the forum for general questions like this, other users might benefit from the thread.\n. Binaries are in the attached archive (green one).\nThe one that you mention should include sources and doesn't. Weird. Thanks for letting us know.\n. @calmdev, what's the point of installing this via composer anyway? I've merged the commit with composer.json, but it's still a bit of mystery to me. Is there any benefit? After all Plupload is not exactly a PHP package or anything ready to be used out of the box... Can you describe how do you use it?\n. Yes, that was pretty informative, thank you. Have you tried Bower?\n. What you mean by \"trying to attach a document\"? Post your config please.\n. I'm not sure what you are doing, but if you are trying to upload cross-origin, it won't work in html4.\n. No that's not what I'm saying. html4 should work just fine in any browser, be it IE8 or even IE6. It's just that it can't upload files to the domain that differs from the one from which it was loaded.\n. Btw, I can't see any code. Whatever you've pasted shouldn't be functional by itself.\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1391.\n. Elephant in the room!.. \nI was testing it through FileFiltered, that's why it probably slipped from my view.\njayarjo, how could i contact you, or could i join this project team\nAren't you contacting right now? You can always fork the project and suggest fixes via pull requests.\n. I don't get your question, sorry.\n. That last UploadProgress is there for different reason. For you purpose you could simply listen to FileUploaded..?\n. Post a config please.\n. Safari on Windows doesn't support selecting multiple files (there's a bug in a browser itself - not sure if they fixed it by now). Is this the case? Otherwise I can't repeat it.\n. Plupload 1.5.8 used a dirty workaround, which we decided not to port to 2.1.2.\n. Will be closing this, since Safari for Windows is being dead for quite a while already.. Are you experiencing this on a bundled examples?\n. Plupload cannot be initialized properly on hidden elements. That's why we have uploader.refresh() method in first place.. One could simply intercept FilesAdded and cancel selection by returning false from the handler, if any specific condition is not met.. Not sure what you are trying to do there, but the way you have it, the value for overwrite param will be assigned only once - during the initialization of Plupload (it might be that at that moment value for $('#overwrite') is not yet set).\nTo alter the value for the multipart_params dynamically, use: \nuploader.setOption('multipart_params', {...})\n. I'd say not where but when. You should make this call only when you are sure that $('#overwrite') has acquired the value.\n. Oh... just noticed that you are using UI Widget, the format of the call will change then to:\n$(\"#uploader\").plupload('option', 'multipart_params', {...});\nBut again you can put anywhere. You just need to make sure that when it gets invoked $('#overwrite') already has a value.\n. When does $('#overwrite') element acquire it's value?\n. Then you should attach the listener to that checkbox and alter multipart_params accordingly when it's clicked, from within that listener.\n. Sorry, I do not get what you are up to. How can you have it dynamically upon initialization, when it doesn't have a value upon initialization. I guess you should reread the thread and wrap your mind around it. You definitely miss a point there.\n. This is not a Plupload question, since I already told how you can set the value for multipart_params at any moment. It is general question about the DOM, events and JavaScript. I'm not sure how to help you further. I've already told you everything I could. You simply need to sit back for some time and realize the situation, maybe you should ask yourself some questions and try and found answers for them from what I already told you and from what you know from other sources :)\n. This means that by the moment of upload $('#overwrite').val() is an empty string (single you retrieve it dynamically).. @cometta sorry missed this report :) What you mean by - can help. I do not see how it can be reduced any futher with all that stuff in it...?. It is possible to compile it without image manipulation support, then you will get less size by ~40kb and much smaller shims (Flash/Silverlight). Or you can compile it without additional runtimes altogether and gain even more. Then if you gzip it, should be around 20kb or less.\nI don't think size matters this much these days anyway. But if you have practical suggestions I will consider them :). Check this thread: http://plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=4069\n. Did you actually get the file on the server? The error says that upload.php cannot be found at the specified url. Make sure that you reference it properly (try absolute url instead of relative one).\n. Have you tried absolute url? Please try (do not just assume that it will be the same).\n. You shouldn't change $targetDir to url. $targetDir should be a path to directory to store the uploads.\nSo it works now? \n. @kjin9174 we have a getting started guide here: http://www.plupload.com/docs/v2/Getting-Started. What do you mean by secure environment? Chrome / FF are fine with Flash or - in general?\n. @beshsh, Flash and Silverlight work fine in our tests here. What exactly wasn't working in your case? More details wouldn't harm. Can you also post your config.\n. I think you guys overcomplicate things. Plupload and other similarly licensed products are free for personal use or for use in an open source project. Any other use cases fall under commercial license, which is outlined here: http://www.plupload.com/license/oem.\n. @Afraithe @spocke can you put a more detailed explanation for the issue in this ticket? And maybe to the referenced ones as well?\n. We've added new filter prevent_empty, that is on by default, but can be turned off if needed.. I doubt we could fight that. But in theory it shouldn't go to sleep if upload is happening... Hm.\n. This happens because files array is altered as you cycle over it (you remove items from it yourself). Use uploader.splice() instead.. Don't think we will be adding such an option. But you could easily calculate percentage yourself, by doing some obvious arithmetic on loaded and total bytes.. @Pellay, if file is duplicate then duplicateFile will be duplicate of file property. What's the point?\n. There's a StateChanged event, that fires each time Plupload is started or stopped. Then it is possible to check the actual state of the uploader, for example:\nplupload.STARTED === up.state\nor\nplupload.STOPPED === up.state\nStateChanged amd up.state of plupload.STARTED can be considered as QueueStart. Other than that we probably won't be adding any other events. . Why would you pass in just one size - what is Plupload supposed to do in such case?\n. If you are not using chunking, there's no limit on file size for Flash (kind of paradox). Post your config.\n. Why multipart:false - do you have any specific reason for that?\n. multipart:false enables our artificial upload mode, that - yes - supports cookies and has lots of other benefits, but also one big drawback - it requires the whole file to be read into memory first. That's the reason behind your crash I guess. On the other hand, native upload method doesn't have such drawback, but as you rightfully noticed has problems with cookies (famous Flash problem btw). The typical way of dealing with this is to send session identifiers with the file as multipart params and reconstruct it on server-side.\nIn fact I'm surprised that WebKit gets it right these days. I'm afraid currently there is nothing that can be done to improve the situation across all browsers though. If you need to send big files and use Flash I wouldn't recommend enabling chunking or setting multipart to false. Better consider the solution I stated above.\n. html5 should display nice progress, put it first in the list. Not sure where your concern comes from about it.\n. Can you post the rest of your Plupload config? Flash is picky.\n. Can you try it without headers?\n. v1.x is deprecated,you should not be using it anymore.. You could simply create custom language pack and map corresponding messages to whatever you find more appropriate.\nI'm afraid currently we are not planning to make further changes to error messages.. Is it about some specific files, or the error is thrown for any chunked upload?\n. A lot. But nothing that I could associate with what you describe. One thing that comes to mind is that Unknown platform fails the test for chunking support and sends the whole file, effectively hitting some limitation on your server. Can you compare the request sizes for platforms that succeed and fail?\n. Maybe you should recheck upload url. I'm testing and writing it on mac myself, so in general it works.. Plupload doesn't add anything to file names by itself. Are you uploading to a cloud service of some kind? Maybe post your client and server-side code to troubleshoot it better.\n. It is probably about one of the widgets..?\n. I mean it's implementation bug, not - Pluploads. But - yes, pretty alarming anyway. Thanks for bringing this up.\n. Adding a filter is a way to go. In your case it doesn't work 'cause you are not testing for invalid characters in the filename.\n. Added bower.json. Although it seems there's an intensive campaign going on (lead by FB) to kill it off.\n. While server response indeed wasn't passed to uploaded event handler, the way you expect arguments in your handler isn't correct. It should be:\njavascript\n$(\"#uploaderdatei\").on(\"uploaded\", function(e, args)\n{\n    console.log(args);\n    /*\n    args.up - plupload.Uploader instance\n    args.file - plupload.File instance\n    args.result - server response, headers and http status code\n        args.result.status\n        args.result.response\n        args.result.responseHeaders\n   */\n});\nargs.result was absent until now, but the commit above fixes it.\n. https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1172. And: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1087. Hm, yes - definitely looks like a problem. Although in Exif spec RATIONAL type is defined as:\nTwo LONGs. The first LONG is the numerator and the second LONG expresses the\ndenominator.\nThat's where this 4 came from.\n. I might not remember correctly, but I think Safari on Windows didn't support file slicing, so there was basically no way to send it in chunks. But I guess now that Safari for Windows is gone, we can close this one.. I got this fixed back then and forgot to mark it as such. Sorry. Thanks for reporting!. It is a known issue, the mode that can send cookies in silverlight cannot send custom headers and vice versa. We have table of capabilities outlined here by runtimes and  operational modes: Required Features.. And why do you think you can't upload xml files? xml files upload just fine. Maybe you should simply configure your file filters accordingly.\n. @cTallberg not sure what the question is? Check: http://www.plupload.com/docs/v2/File-Filters.. zip it maybe?. v2.2.0 now has some additional options for image resizing, specifically crop and fit.\n. We have the runtimes to choose from Google Drive and Dropbox. But no - you can't choose files from the server itself. Plupload is file uploader, where files are uploaded to the server from elsewhere. Uploading from the server to the same server obviously doesn't bear any sense.\nMaybe you are looking for another product from us MoxieManager.\n. Sorry, for noticing this one so late.  I myself use mac on daily basis, never happened to me. It might have been that your userAgent string was overriden for some reason.. If you return false from BeforeUpload file won't be uploaded. Then you can do alterations or any async operations that you require and requeue the file by changing it's state to plupload.QUEUED. File will be picked up on the next upload iteration automatically.\nWe probably won't be adding promises to Plupload.. In general if you do not set preserve_headers to false, that's what should happen by default - all meta headers should be restored after resizing operation is complete. Do you dynamically change resize options maybe? Can you post your config?\n. Sorry... missed it. Try to set resize like this:\njavascript\nresize: {\n    width: 2048,\n    height: 2048,\n    quality: 90,\n    preserve_headers: true\n},\n. Have you tried to subscribe to Error event? It actually is supposed to trigger one, when file has invalid extension.\n. When the file with a wrong extension makes through, Plupload fires plupload.FILE_EXTENSION_ERROR, which resolves into Error #-601: File extension error. Try Core API demo in Firefox for example and select something other than \"jpg,gif,png\", you will see the error.\nMaybe post your code and we will check why it doesn't fire in your case.\n. I guess we could safely report upload as not supported for iOS >= 8 and < 8.0.2 (Safary only, Chrome seems to be ok).\n. I do not think it is installable in such way - Plupload is not Drupal plugin. I guess someone somewhere used Plupload to make such plugin, but I guess you should look up for it elsewhere. Sorry.\n. Here's the comment on the method that generates those unique names:\nThe only way a user would be able to get the same ID is if the two persons at the same exact millisecond manage to get the same 5 random numbers between 0-65535; it also uses a counter so each id is guaranteed to be unique for the given page. It's more probable for the earth to be hit with an asteroid.\nSounds pretty unique, aye? \nAre you sure that some files are not filtered out upon selection? Do you receive FileUploaded event for the files that later disappear?\nOn your place I'd log everything - requests, files that were written, requests that came in and didn't find the files that should have been there, etc. Such info could help to narrow the problem. \n. It uses that prefix internally, that's where that o_ comes from. But you can easily come up with your own unique name generation algorithm and use it instead.  Here's how we do it internally:\njavascript\n    function onBeforeUpload(up, file) {\n        // Generate unique target filenames\n        if (up.settings.unique_names) {\n            var matches = file.name.match(/\\.([^.]+)$/), ext = \"part\";\n            if (matches) {\n                ext = matches[1];\n            }\n            file.target_name = file.id + '.' + ext;\n        }\n    }\nThis is basically on BeforeUpload handler and we use unique file id as the unique name. You can disable internal unique_names (by setting the corresponding option to false), hook onto BeforeUpload yourself and assign whatever you think is more appropriate.\n. Could you try and load the unminified versions of the plupload and see if it produces more meaningful error message with exact line number. Check the examples/ folder inside the Plupload package. All examples have this in the header:\n``` html\n production \n\n debug \n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../js/moxie.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../js/plupload.dev.js\"></script>\n\n```\nComment production block and uncomment debug block to load development versions of the scripts. Let us know if you get the error again and what it will be.\n. It lets me select the files in IE8 with your code, but the rest of the logic obviously fails, since I do not have some of your functions defined. Although when I stub them, it works as expected.\nYou have a typo here btw:\njavascript\n                    deluploadfile(file.id,1);\n                    alert(\"\u60a8\u4e0a\u4f20\u6587\u4ef6\"+myTempFileName+\"\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u540d\u957f\u5ea6\u5927\u4e8e20,\u8bf7\u4fee\u6539\");\n                    return ture;\nreturn ture; probably is meant to be return true;\n. What is the version of Flash player in your IE8? And please follow the instruction I posted above.\n. Can you post a gist of your code? Tried to repeat the case by adding second Plupload to the same container on the hidden browse button. Seems to work.\n. Looks like IE does leak some unexpected behavior while trying to remove the SWF object from the DOM. I guess I will port over some additional precautions that SWFObject had in place at the time.\nBut do you still get the error when you remove flash from the list of runtimes?\nIn general Flash and Silverlight will fail if you try to initialize them to a hidden container and that's expected (second Plupload instance will fallback all the way to html4). It might have worked in 1.x version because Plupload structures were appended to the document.body by default, unless you were specifying container option explicitly. In version 2.x we thought that it's logical to append the Plupload to the immediate parent of the browse button by default (so that developer doesn't have to call uploader.refresh() now and then - Plupload shim will simply follow the browse button as long as it doesn't move inside its parent container). So if you do not specify container option, that's what will happen. If you are dealing with containers that get hidden, you better use the \"old way\" explicitly and specify document.body as a container in the config and call uploader.refresh() everytime you show/hide or reposition browse button. That way Plupload will never get inside a hidden container, but float over it when required.\n. If it worked in 1.x and you didn't call uploader.refresh(), on tab selection, then either your page mostly fits on the screen (and doesn't require scroll) or you were lucky enough to never notice the problem with displaced dialog picker (unless I misunderstand something about the structure of your page).\nThe simple workaround for this would be to specify first parent in the chain of ancestors that doesn't get hidden, as a container (for example wrapper element for the tabs). \n. Does it throw an error or simply stops responding to your clicks?\nHere, try this one: https://gist.github.com/jayarjo/8e89b6254f1f06602f39. What I did there is that I've moved the filelist element to the bottom, so that files that are added to it do not push the browse button down and therefore Plupload stays on the right place without calling uploader.refresh().\n. I cannot tell what exactly you are doing in your application, but if 1.x worked for you then having 2.x config with container option set to document.body, should give you exactly the same behavior.\n. Have you had container option set to anything in 1.x version of your application?\n. Flash or Silverlight cannot work if their objects or objects parents are hidden. That's just how these technologies work. I cannot imagine at the moment how they could work in 1.x if you had container option set to something that was invisible at the time of initialisation. I tell you more, if Plupload is uploading something and you hide it, it will stop. In some older browsers it even reinitialized itself. So if you plan to show hide the browse buttons and still want uploads to proceed, you should have Plupload shims out from the container that gets hidden (that's the only working scenario, which is true for both versions 1.x and 2.x, basically because it is not Pluploads constraint, but that of Flash/Silverlight). \nBut when you append Plupload shims to the outer container, there are some additional precautions to take, you should acknowledge that they are absolutely positioned relative to the containers top-left corner and can effectively overlap, if browse buttons have the same absolute position. The task is trivial, you should simply enable/disable corresponding uploader, when the corresponding tab is clicked. But if you do not have control over the tabs and the events that they fire, I do not see how you can make this work, either in 1.x or 2.x.\n. If your software is accessible I could take a look and see what exactly is happening and come up with working scenario.\n. If that's what caused it, then the fix, that I referenced above (https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/a0bb84906c4b735b6028ea271542cb4c59eb20ea) should also work. If you are comfortable with editing the code, could you check it as well? That's the one that will be incorporated in coming release.\n. You are using UI Widget and trying to attach event as if you were using Plupload API directly.\nHere's how you can rewrite your code for UI Widget:\n``` javascript\n$(\"#uploader\").plupload({\n        // General settings\n        runtimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight,html4',\n        url : 'upload.php',\n        rename : true,\n        dragdrop: true,\n        filters : {\n            // Maximum file size\n            max_file_size : '2mb',\n            // Specify what files to browse for\n            mime_types: [\n                {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png,jpeg\"}\n            ],\n            min_img_width: 100,\n            min_img_height: 100\n        },\n        views: {\n            list: true,\n            thumbs: true, // Show thumbs\n            active: 'thumbs'\n        },\n        flash_swf_url : 'http://sylab-mass.stor.sinaapp.com/static/other/Moxie.swf',\n        silverlight_xap_url : 'http://sylab-mass.stor.sinaapp.com/static/other/Moxie.xap',\n    complete: function(e, ui) {\n         alert('Upload Complete');\n         $('#ok').removeAttr('disabled');\n    },\n    selected: function(e, ui) {\n         alert('Add a file');\n         $('#ok').attr('disabled','true');\n    }\n});\n\n```\nCheck documentation for full list of the events supported by UI Widget.\n. It is not the case in general and jpeg files make through just fine, when specified in filters. Can you provide more details?\n. What exactly your code looks like? Do the examples on our site fail as well?\n. If any of the containers are not visible by the moment Plupload initializes, we cannot place the browse button properly (since invisible elements do not have neither size, nor position). For this reason we have a special method on the uploader object - refresh().\nSo simply call uploader.refresh() whenever you finally decide to display the target element.. Can you share jpegs that fail? I'm refactoring exif parser at the moment.\n. 2.1.6 is out now with the fix.\n. Suggestion for such cases is to append Plupload structures (including third party shims) to some DOM element that stays visible, by setting container option to it.. It is possible to hook onto BeforeUpload event and cancel it by returning false, then using core moxie.file.FileReader to preload file with file.getNative() as a source, then doing whatever is planned and constructing the Blob, which can be added back to the queue via uploader.addFile().\nOne will have to remove original file from the queue then.\nI'm afraid there's no other way :/ . Yep, I'm afraid there's no other way around. Or you could simply cycle through the files in FilesAdded, mark them as plupload.FAILED and show some custom ui for the case.. File filters are for filtering files out completely, and throwing customized error for each one. But if you want to keep files somehow, probably will be better to do it manually..  Ugly or not that's how you handle async operations in JavaScript world :). That is not possible currently. At least not with bundled widgets. One could probably build custom implementation... I'm not sure how would you retain file references between page reloads though?\n. Unfortunately browsers do not constrain file selection by default and currently we do not seem to have any control over that. However you should get an option in the file type dropdown to select only jpegs.\n. It gets better as the time goes by and although browser support still inadequate, I'm going to close this one, since there is nothing we can do about it.. Browsers now have better support for file filtering, so this should work everywhere now.. For flash we disable chunking by default, since it doesn't provide access to file data until you preload it in memory, which obviously ruins the whole point of chunking for big files.\nIf you want to forcefully enable chunking in all runtimes, set required_features to true in the config.\n. Everything is out of the context in that function, so not a pressing problem I guess. Or do you mean something else?\n. We did eventually add BeforeChunkUpload event. So it is possible to checksum each chunk or do some more complex operations on it.. The code that checks for the file type is fully standalone and here is how it is actually declared in the Plupload source:\njavascript\nplupload.addFileFilter('mime_types', function(filters, file, cb) {\n    if (filters.length && !filters.regexp.test(file.name)) {\n        this.trigger('Error', {\n            code : plupload.FILE_EXTENSION_ERROR,\n            message : plupload.translate('File extension error.'),\n            file : file\n        });\n        cb(false);\n    } else {\n        cb(true);\n    }\n})\nfilters.regexp is auto-generated internally every time mime types are changed (I don't recommend to rely on its existence).\nplupload.addFileFilter() is public static method. You can easily add your own filters or redefine default ones. For example you could put some environment aware code into the filter, that will process image files on Android devices in a different way. We even have brief getting started guide here: File Filters.\n. @akhanPLH, how exactly is it affecting your functionality?\nWe decided to filter it out because IE used to hang on empty files (not sure if the Edge has the same issue). It didn't seem a problem at the time. Why would you want to upload empty files?. I'm going to add a custom option to allow empty files in the next minor release.. @akhanPLH are your users dropping folders onto uploader? or how?\n\nAdditionally, and Im not sure if this is an identified issue, is that we found that a folder that consists of a single .txt file only uploads the folder, and not the txt file itself. This gets corrected if there is another file, such as a pdf, within the same folder. Only then does the txt file get uploaded. This is very dangerous as this can result in data loss for our users.\n\nI cannot reproduce it. Try this fiddle: http://play.plupload.com/t__J_/4. Are txt files allowed in your config?. Silverlight takes some time to initialize. Might be around 5-10 secs. Currently we simply have to live with this. Or in case you are not interested in client-side image manipulations, you could use minified version, which is smaller in size (much smaller) and initializes instantly. You can find it under bin/ folder in moxie repo.\nBut in general instead of initializing the Plupload on dialog open, I would suggest to initialize it right away and simply call uploader.refresh() when dialog is finally shown. For this to work as expected you will need to pass a container for Plupload in the config manually, let it be some DOM element that doesn't get hidden (use document.body as last resort).\n. dropbox runtime is officially supported now, but to upload from dropbox to s3 you will have to use multipart (chunked) upload to s3 and this is something that Plupload cannot currently do (not out of the box at least). But you could build something directly on top of moxie.\n. In next release upload logic will be moved to PluploadFile object, instead of being global within plupload.Uploader, so the xhr and removeFile will become specific to the given file.\nThank you for your report though.\n. @jsanchez034 master branch has it for some time already. It is tested, but not yet released though.\n. It is local to PluploadFile, here.\n. When file is destroyed it doesn't trigger onDestroy, which is destroy handler for the whole uploader.\nThe effort on the master branch has been stuck (for various reasons) and is abandoned now. Instead we have Plupload v3.x (I will be doing bugfix release now that I've finally managed to allocate time for it), with the support of simultaneous file/chunk uploads (and a more proper fix for this issue).. Inappropriate handling of global inner xhr has been also addressed in v2.3.2.. Probably GitHub doesn't allow hotlinking anymore. Otherwise seems to works as expected. Also we now have our own Playground for filing demos and problematic cases.. We do not ship any java with Plupload currently, so whatever the error it doesn't seem to be related to Plupload. Are using PHP on the server?\n. We've not released any 2.1.4 just yet... last stable version is 2.1.2.\nTry to set container option in your config to document.body.\n. In the API documentation is written, that 'document.body' is default for container.\nWhere? That'd be something that we'd have to correct. That's how it used to be in Plupload 1.x, but in 2.x container option (if not specified manually) is automatically set to the immediate parent of browse_button.\nIf i set container manualy to 'document.body' i get this exception: \"TypeError: container is null\".\ndocument.body is an object, you should pass it in without quotes.\n. Hm... but does it work in general, lets say in Chrome?\n. Interesting, doesn't work for me. In fact we never meant it to. But now that you brought up this topic, I think it's a good idea. I'll see what can be done there.\n. @xpbliss, to clear the queue, you can do uploader.splice(), to add the file - uploader.addFile().\n. Apparently in your case it falls back to html4 runtime, which doesn't have access to file size property in IE8 and below.\n. Where possible image preview will now use blob uris. Don't know if that's what other libraries use, but it definitely makes the whole process faster.\nHowever iOS still has a huge delay after files are selected and before it actually hands them to Plupload. Not something we can address.. Chunking is disabled in Flash runtime by default, since it doesn't do what it is meant to in Flash. Check: When to use chunking and when not?.\nIf you want to enable chunking anyway, set: required_features to true.\n. Btw, chunk_size is meant to be number, not string. Although should work anyway.\n. Currently only jpegs and pngs. Pull requests are welcome.\n. Please check: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/pull/1325.\n. Example must be as simple as possible. And I do not mean that our examples are the best. I'd say the opposite. But they mainly demonstrate must-have principles (more or less). What you suggest is subjective way of sanitizing file names, many users won't like the way it treats unicode file names for example...  (is g modifier even valid in php?).\nThe referenced thread has a link to a project that proposes more customizable backend code.\n. Can you share failing exe file? 'cause in our tests we do not encounter such thing.\nWhat is the version of Plupload that has problem? Are you using bundled upload.php on server side?\n. Don't have IE9, tried in IE8 (Flash and Silverlight), can't repeat the glitch. Btw, couldn't open the zip properly - it failed to extract the corrupted uploaded file.\n. Could you provide an example?\n. Can you post typical domain name in chinese, that you are having a problem with?\n. I'd suggest to encode your  domain in Punycode. Formore details see my response to: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1336#issuecomment-320492390.. NuGet package has been updated to Plupload 2.2.1.. We got bower support. Better late than never. Thanks for upvotes.\n. Yes, as many as you like, however custom api doesn't add any form fields automatically, so one will have to do it himself.\nHow did you came up with the username like that? Don't you have some firstname-lastname? Should have reserved it when I could :)\n. total.reset() is invoked at the beginning of internal calc() method: here. calc() method on its turn is invoked when files are added to or removed from the queue, on upload progress, and on upload complete. So basically your addition doesn't seem to affect anything.\nDid it solve it for you? What exactly were you trying to achieve?\n. Do you mean our S3 example is outdated or that Plupload is not compatible with new signing version?\n. @jaredcassidy sure, that'd be great.. Are you sure those field types that make it through for enabled chunking are actually chunked? They could be simply smaller than the size you specify for the single chunk. \nIt should be something about your environment, since it works in the usual scenario.\nWhat is the error that you receive back from the upload.php?\n. Sounds like you have some kind of restriction either in your upload.php or in your server env, since Plupload doesn't really differentiate between file types (during the chunking or the upload) by itself. \nCannot imagine at the moment any case that might lead to what you describe.\n. Could you arrange a test case online?\n. That makes sense. But are you sending files as binary streams?\n. jsFiddle itself stopped supporting IE8. I guess you have to try it manually.\n. Does it work when you load bundled examples directly in IE8?\n. It works here, so it should be something about your environment. Are you sure you actually have Silverlight or Flash installed in your IE8?\n. Open source license has been switched to AGPLv3.\n. This has been a topic for quite some time already, so I guess I'll get that implemented in one way or another. I promise I will consider all ideas that have been submitted here and in another threads.\n. I do not immediately see how something like this could happen. It might have been an issue with 1.x version where we didn't set container implicitly, but in 2.x and up we automatically set container to the immediate parent of browse_button element. If for some reason it fails you have an option to specify container manually.\n. Chunking is not recommended in Flash, since it doesn't do what it is supposed to do (stream upload the file without loading in memory that is). If you still want to enable chunking for Flash set required_features to true.\n. I believe it has something to do with your upload handler and the response that it sends back to Plupload. Are you using our bundled upload.php? Have you modified it?\n. Do you want to cancel specific one, or what exactly is your question? CancelUpload will abort the upload.\n. It is possible, but I'd suggest to use underlying mOxie module directly.\n. Why this question? Is there something you want to be in Plupload, that is not already there?\nWe are working on html5 version only, that will probably have some other name.\n. @Daijobou, min/max width/heigth?\n. Development is still going on, but much slower. Mostly bug fixes. There was an attempt to restructure Plupload in version 3. And bugfix release for it will be out next week.. Not a typical case, I'd say. Fiddle might help.. Ouch... However should be enough to check if error code is plupload.HTTP_ERROR.\n. Fixed in the wiki: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/File-Filters. Website will update.. Version of the Plupload that is currently being developed on master branch is quite different from 2.1.x, and - yes, not all event handlers are properly attached at the moment (see https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1198).\nBtw, autostart is specific to UI Widget and does nothing for pure core implementation.\n. Sorry not clear what the problem is. In general while it is possible to pipe the native file to flash runtime (what I was even thinking about when I was adding support for this...), I definitely wouldn't recommend that. And I actually wonder why would anyone want to do that in first place?. Plupload is multi-runtime solution. So timeout logic should be generic. I will bear this in mind, but do not currently think that it is worth implementing. More thoughts on this: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1042#issuecomment-325105765.. multi_selection=true was buggy on some older iOSes, so it was disabled there.. Hm... I think I missed this one the first time. \n. @JohnRSim are you experiencing this issue too? I'm not able to repeat it. Could you post more details about your case?\n. This seems to be some kind of IE + Flash bug, not Plupload related, but something global. You can try any page with flash movie on it, like this one from adobe. Add a hash at the end before you paste in the url and then once it loads, simply click on the flash object.\nNot sure what we can do about it. One workaround would be to restore original title once the object is focused. But not sure if messing with the title manually is the right thing to do.\n. There's artificial constraint in Plupload, which keeps it from trying to resize anything that is larger than 8192x8192 (on either side). This is basically done because if browser for some reason runs out of memory, we have no way to intercept that and throw a meaningful error. . Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1502. Looks like it's already there, thanks.. @giox069 when does this error fire up? Provide a code and config and maybe a call stack dump...?\n. Hm... actually we never meant it to work with jQuery in such way. I need to experiment a bit. But in general what you said you ended up with, would my solution to your scenario.\n. Might have been problem at the moment, but definitely is not anymore.. Since browsers now allow filtering directly by extensions (and I believe this is why that fix works), this probably can be closed.. Thank you for your time. Although I'd suggest to use Plupload of version 2 at least.. We have mime types for ppt in our internal registry. Seems to work here: http://play.plupload.com/0__J_/. List of files and inputs is redrawn after each QueueChange, so one would need to add those custom fields again and again.I would suggest to hook onto BeforeUpload and use multipart_params to send additional fields with every upload. . Where do you get this error? Are you sure that jquery.ui.plupload.js that you load is not corrupted?\n. Strange it doesn't appear here and neither does affect anything, even in IEs. How did you extract the zipball, and what is the platform and browser where you get the error?\n. Seems to be the same as: #1113. I will incrementally back port fixes from master branch to 2.1.x and eventually release 2.1.4.\nMaster branch will become 2.2.x.\n. It's not about IE, it's about whether a browser (can be any model, and variety of versions) supports File API (FileReader specifically).\n. Closing this, since it is more of generic question rather than an issue report.\n. The way you did it is the right way (I mean through the custom filter). . gifs are not considered as images currently, only jpegs and pngs.\n. If you have a resizing container for the Plupload or the browse button moves within that container for some other reason, you will have to call uploader.refresh() after each movement. That's what it was created for in first place. It's not an overkill, what it does is just reposition and resize Plupload shim to match the browse button again.\nThere's only way you can avoid calling uploader.refresh() - that would be by placing browse button into a container that doesn't stretch in any way. It can float within a document in a responsive way, but it should retain dimensions. That would be it. \nBut if you require to have a browse button that resizes with the layout, there is no way you can ask Plupload to resize automatically, unless you put uploader.refresh() in the handler for the resize event. \n. It means those images contain Orientation tag, that gets stripped for thumbnails (we are trying to generate them as fast as possible). And they are not visually adjusted anymore. \nThis is expected behaviour. . That's not a case in general can you describe your scenario in more detail? And provide a config maybe.\n. It is not exactly clear from your excerpt how Plupload is instantiated. Please make sure that you are not instantiating it twice for the same browse_button, inspect the DOM from developer tools for example. \n. One can use uploader.splice() method to clear the whole queue.. pluploader.destroy() simply removes associated html structures and internal references, so that object can be garbage collected when not required anymore.\nAnd where this idea even comes from? I do not see how this (deleting the actual variable) can be done from inside of uploader object anyway.\n. There are two cases when something might happen to your image file on the way to server:\n1. If you are using chunking and as @aik099 mentioned not reassembling the file back properly.\n2. If you have a resize option enabled in your configuration - then depending on the settings that you have there, Plupload might attempt to strip the meta headers off (and they might contain some important data like orientation or colour interpretation).\nIn all other cases your file should travel over intact. Post your config if you want us to troubleshoot this further.\n. Does it fix itself if you remove chunk_size: '1mb'?\n. @makwanaajay, I cannot open that image in Photoshop neither after, nor before the upload. Apparently Plupload doesn't have anything to do with the error.\nClosing this. Feel free to reopen if you have more details to share.\n. It is done internally. Should be something else. We do not encounter this in our unit tests. Would be interesting to look at your case.\n. Actually it is debug version. Release version is .min.js.\n. You should call refresh only after the dialog is shown, otherwise it's useless. Attach an event listener to the open event of UI Dialog and call refresh from there.\n. Also is there any reason to mix regular and UI Widget style event listeners, like you do in your sample?\n. 2.1.6 is out now. Upgrade recommended.\n. Fix has been incorporated into: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/3b925d07fbdb9b10a280ff1b04bd03d5b3a9e5a5. Thanks @fricca.\n. Implemented now.\n. HTML4 is still supported and example that you mention is functional. While the file size is not available in HTML4 inside IE9, upload should work anyway. And it does in our unit tests. \nIf you still experience this issue please provide more details, the config (in case you changed it), upload handler (if its different from bundled upload.php) and the file that gets uploaded empty.\n. HTML4 is there only as last resort. It doesn't support chunking and yes - it can only send multipart. If you require these, you simply shouldn't use HTML4. Rely on HTML5, Silverlight and Flash.\nIn case you do not need to support legacy browsers simply use HTML5 only and you will have it all.\n. Try: 2.1.6.\n. There was a different problem that prevented DnD from working in 2.1.5, that was fixed now in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/40f9e1684339ebc18ff0731793014700c5a1f9d5. But I cannot repeat Uncaught TypeError: e.webkitGetAsEntry error.\n. Try: 2.1.7.\n. Yes, seems like the fix for each() method actually killed it. Made a fix here: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/40f9e1684339ebc18ff0731793014700c5a1f9d5.\n. Here: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/releases/tag/v2.1.6.\n. Do you specify .jpeg extension in the list of extensions? Post your config.\n. Looks like they've changed the logic for accept attribute and now support extensions in the list, since version 37. Until now we only had it in the Chrome/Safari and IE10+. I will add Firefox in the list as well.\nHowever, @jochemmeyers, it was reported that there is some kind of problem with .tif extension. While this is definitely an inconvenience, browsers still provide a way to select the files, via All files option. I guess that's what we have to rely upon, until browser vendors settle down with their feature updates.\n. Firefox seems to handle this properly now.. Image selection wouldn't be a typical trigger for this. Can you post your config?\n. I'm not able to repeat the error in usual scenario. Are you getting the error in the bundled UI example as well?\n. Thank you for taking your time to report this.\n. Sorry, I can't merge this from here. If you want to contribute to the language pack, you will have to do it from its Transifex page.\n. I've added you myself now.\n. What did you mean by \"downloaded\"?. @provegard why would you reply with a response like that? If it's some file you could request it separately or simply display a download link (or redirect to a download link).. For other runtimes, like Flash and Silverlight it's problematic in general to pipe high volume data to browser environment. So while it is possible, I would probably not recommend it. At the very least it won't be as fast and effective as let's say a download link.. Yes, ugly. But I'm afraid it is the only way to make html4 interpret json response properly.\n. Well... it is not really a requirement to send text/html header, html4 runtime will work even if you don't send any header. It's specifically application/json header that causes download behaviour. I believe problem has been mentioned multiple times in the forum.\nWe have a description of basic server-side handler in our Getting Started guide and the handler for the chunked upload in Chunking guide. Also check the code for our sample Plupload PHP Handler.\n. Which Plupload version are you using?\n. Well... since you do not provide any more details, I can only guess that jQuery UI is not loaded by the moment when Plupload UI requires it. Might be something about the order in which you load the scripts. You should load jQuery and jQuery UI, and only after that - Plupload and Plupload UI. Also make sure that you do not encounter any javascript errors in other (non-Plupload related) scripts that you load before Plupload.\n. In which os/browser? And what exactly is the problem - does it filter everything except jpeg, or it doesn't constrain files to jpeg only?\n. I'm afraid one simply needs to add jpeg to the list of extensions.. We do not ignore empty files anymore (by default).. 2.1.8 is aggregated from 2.1.x branch not master. Master is a preparation for 2.3.x and it will be based on mOxie 1.5.x not 1.3.x. It might not be immediately obvious, but I had to do this to release numerous fixes and updates that were pending (#1272, #1273).\n. Does the same document work when you load it directly in the browser?\n. So, are you running .NET WebAPI server as well?\n. If it's a Flash runtime, then in send_binary_string mode progress is not available and is roughly approximated. Should gradually improve if you are uploading more than one file.\n. Can you post your config?\n. What is the point of this code, or is it for example only?\nbrowse_button value is flushed after files have been added to the queue. So you cannot really access any of it with var file = $('#pickfiles')[0].files[0];. Whatever you do, try it on separate input[type=\"file\"] maybe.\n. Init error might have following reasons:\n- browse_button (or it's container) is not present in the DOM at the time of initialisation, is hidden or doesn't have dimensions (Flash specifically has problems with this).\n- Flash Player version doesn't match minimum requirement of 10.3.\n- Frequent reason for the fail might also be a wrong url for the swf shim, be sure to recheck the console for 404 errors.\n. Seems to be a regression (fixed it in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/5152098cacf9b5c1de00ff18ea63908029fc4bb4). \nTo get a quick fix for this you could change the following line:\njavascript\nchunks: 'slice_blob',\nto this:\njavascript\nchunks: 'access_binary',\n. Plupload doesn't depend on server responses or their formats. We tried to keep it purely a client-side solution. So we won't be implementing this in the Core API. And in the widgets I think we adequately highlight files that are uploading..? In case you are using your own custom implementation, you could do the same - unambiguously express the current state of the file and even hide the percentage completely.. Are you using UI widget or showing thumbs? Do you have any additional filters defined?\nWe have Browse event that is triggered when dialog is opened, and we have FileFiltered event that is fired for every filtered file. Can be used to show loading message or overlay.. I notice quite a delay in iPhone 4S with the most basic file picker: http://play.plupload.com/y__J_/, not using Plupload. Also it's quite low on storage at the moment and safari throws warning about storage being low, as if it was cloning those images to some temp location on the device for each pick.. Connected remote debugger to the iPhone, set around some breakpoints, recorded interaction profile and what can conclude now is that delay happens before a change event is triggered on the file picker, so it's way before Plupload takes control over this stuff. Profile didn't show any point where we could intervene and optimize something. So I guess we are out of control there...\nSuggestions are welcome.. Second argument to Error event contains all response headers in addition to code and message.\n. @fr33tux this is not a typical case. Can you file your case at http://play.plupload.com?. Does the HTML 5 > Flash > HTML 4 > HTML 5 sequence work?\n. Ok, it seems some zIndex issue. Quick fix for this would be to reset the zIndex for the browse_button element to zero, after each destroy, something like this:\njavascript\ndocument.getElementById('pickfiles').style.zIndex = 0;\nBtw, IE shouldn't be affected by this issue (IE 6/7/8/9 - only ones that require Flash/Silverlight shims).\n. Addressed it in: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/ced843d478a305eb5dec4cfdab78b5f0aac8a2bd.\n. You are welcome.\n. Why this change?\n. That shouldn't be a problem (files with the same name), if prevent_duplicates filter is disabled in your config.\n. We probably won't be implementing that. However I'm going to add relativePath property to plupload.File instances. \nOne could also use unique_names option to generate completely unique names.. Do you maybe remember what was that Firefox version? At the moment Firefox does support drag'n'drop of folders.. We used to use package.json simply to prepare the environment. That's why there was private property set to true. The idea behind ignoring package.json was dictated by the same idea - if anyone wanted to have the dev environment in place, he/she could simply clone the whole repo, rather than download minified release.\n. We've removed private flag on 2.2.x branch and published Plupload on NPM registry.\n. I'm re-organising Plupload for the next release currently. I will take this into account.\n. Extra runtime stuff (at least its JavaScript part) takes extra 20kb or so. Image manipulation code that does client-side resizing before upload takes up to 30kb+. The rest are utilities and Plupload itself. So you do not gain that much by stripping off extra runtimes.\nBut I'm altering the builder for the Plupload and it will be possible to build it with only the runtimes one requires or with/without image support, directly. One won't need to build moxie first, unless you want to recompile the swf/xap shims.\n. And what are the original dimensions of the images?\n. Probably one should conditionally disable client-side resizing in such cases. Legacy browsers are not capable of doing intensive processing of any kind really.. Why don't you try unminified scripts that come in the package? They might give you a more meaningful error and help us troubleshoot it better.\nThat part of the code shouldn't be even functional in IE7 btw, as it includes features that the latter doesn't have.\n. Any reason why you ignore flash runtime? It was created specifically for those legacy browsers.\n. Simultaneous uploads of chunks and files is supported in Plupload v3.x. We won't take it any further probably.. We are trying to generate thumbs as fast as possible, so do not check orientation on purpose.. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1064. Plupload doesn't depend on server responses and doesn't trigger any error by itself, unless there was  some unsatisfying HTTP status code in response. So if you return erroneous HTTP header, Plupload will report upload problem. However I prefer to return an actual message from the server (it can be any format, but I recommend JSON), then capture it in FileUploaded handler (as the third argument) and display it or act on it accordingly.. It might be that you were choosing wrong mime-type. Anyway this nightmare should have ended by now, since browsers started to support filtering by extensions directly. So forget mime-types and addMimeType method.. We do not have video quality filter in Plupload. But I can imagine how one could write one his own.. Sorry. Closing off old tickets.. Seems to work fine: http://play.plupload.com/y/4. @binal24 it is working. If you mean it doesn't work for mp4 files, then I've replied to your question in the #1514 thread.. Resizing options have a special flag: preserve_headers. \nBy default Plupload retains EXIF headers, so if there is an Orientation tag in there, Plupload will keep it. So it will be up to your client software (preview tool, etc) how it will handle it. However if you set it to false - meta headers will get stripped, including Orientation tag. In such case we internally auto-rotate the image in the direction specified by Orientation tag.\nPlay with the option to see if it helps.\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1414.\n. Please check: Plupload in Your Language on howto to contribute to language translations.\nWe cannot accept them here.\n. You shouldn't need to do it. Can you post your code and config?\n. Plupload cannot initialize on hidden elements in some browsers. That's why we have uploader.refresh() method. It's whole purpose is to address just that. Be sure to call it after you show up browse_button element and it will fix the size and placement for the Plupload shim.. Sorry that couldn't help you there. Were you ever able to solve that problem?. It is possible, but not a typical Plupload use case, so probably - no.. Replied to your problem here: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/issues/150. Basically such functionality is not supported by some browsers, especially the old ones, like those you named above. Sad but true.\n. upload.php that we use in Plupload was never meant to be a part of Plupload, we always considered it to be an example. I'm afraid it is already big and bloated, especially with those confusing JSON-RPC (which is completely optional format) responses. Plupload always was and is purely client-side solution. Lets leave it here.\nQuite a while ago I started a separate project: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload-handler-php, that should have become a fully functional alternative to the bundled upload.php. I would gladly accept any PHP oriented pull requests there.\n. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/pull/1325.\n. Initially those widgets (especially Queue widget) were started as examples. One could easily come up with any kind of UI, by using Core API directly.\nI don't think we will be updating Queue Widget. Fixes and pull requests are welcome though.. Plupload on NPM now: https://www.npmjs.com/package/plupload.\n. I must confess I didn't realize properly that this was a big deal. Sorry guys.\n. @suhaotian I think it should correspond to file name, so when you import specify either: plupload.dev, plupload.min or plupload.full.min.\nAlso you should only include built versions from under js/ folder, in  src/, there's raw source only.\n. @suhaotian yes, but I tested it with require. Didn't do any Babel.. @cocody  how do you include it and what kind of post-processing you do on js files after?. Ok, I see now package.json lacks main entry. \nCould you guys be so kind to add something like this to the package.json of installed plupload module:\n\"main\": \"./js/plupload.full.min\",\nand confirm if it makes it work?. v2.2.1 has been published, that addresses missing entry point.. This is not supported currently.\n. Plupload v1.2.1 doesn't depend on mOxie.\n. Hello guys. I'm trying to somehow fix this now. But I do not quite understand your usage case. How exactly do you end up using require on Plupload? Could you elaborate?\n. There's a proper AMD/CommonJS wraper now in v2.2.0.\nAnd we've finally published Plupload on NPM, so npm install plupload should also work.\n. There are couple of things to take into account t in such cases. You must make sure that Plupload initialisation code is run after the page is loaded through the ajax call. And that the browse_button element exists by that time and has dimensions.\n. Might be related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1460#issuecomment-321194821. There are multiple issues with this code. It is not even clear how or when you call public_post method, that starts the uploaders.\nI'd suggest that you start simple (take the code from examples), and build on that, making sure on the way that the whole thing still works.. Try to represent your cyrillic urls with their Punycode alternative instead. Basically if you copy url that consists of such native characters from Chrome address bar, and paste it in some text editor, url will be automatically converted to Punycode.\nThere are also numerous libs for all languages, in case you would like to do it manually. It would unnecessarily increase our source code (already big) if we would incorporate one of this into moxie. . @@version@@ is a placeholder that is replaced with the actual version on build. Check compiled versions under js/ folder.\n. In general Plupload also takes into account Orientation of the image. But your problem seems awkward. Were you saying that Plupload was resizing for you even with resize option set to false?. In 2.3.1 it works properly. I moved your fiddle to: http://play.plupload.com/q__J_/1.. @wtslh what problem didn't get resolved? Does the fiddle above fail for you?. The problem with your code is that you retrieve $('#cuadro').val() only once, when you instantiate Plupload. And at that moment the value is probably empty (or at least not what you expect it to be). You should hook onto the change event for your select box and alter multipart_params accordingly. Or alternatively you could simply hook onto the BeforeUploadevent, which fires for each files separately and retrieve your folder name there.\n. Plupload doesn't mess with extensions in general, even when it does generate unique names for the files, it leaves extension intact. Might be something in your upload handler. Postyour Plupload config and your server side handler code.\n. Try to set unique_names to false.\n. What is the name of the mp4 file that you are trying to upload?\n. Plupload cannot initialise properly on hidden element, so after you finally show the element that should trigger browse dialog (like in the case of drop down menu), you should call uploader.refresh() (that's the whole purpose of that method btw), just as @Daijobou has suggested.. Apparently it is not supported in those other browsers.\n. You could hook onto BeforeUpload and manipulate resize option for each file yourself, switching it on and off depending on the file size of the file being uploaded.. Plupload 1.x and 2.x upload files and chunks sequentially. This is not a bug, just the way it works. Plupload 3.x will bring simultaneous file and chunk uploads.\nBut to address your issue - you could simply enlarge the value for chunk_size, or turn it off completely. There's no benefit or speed boost in chunking. Chunks are required in some scenarios where they are required. Do not use them unless you require.\n. JSON-RPC notation is not obligatory in any way. In fact we do not even use or depend on the server response. We leave it to user. So consider JSON-RPC simply being an examples. You can use any format that you like or need - JSON-RPC, JSON, XML, plain text. Just be sure to handle it appropriately in FileUploaded and other event handlers.\n. Here is the playground where it works: http://play.plupload.com/y/4. Just add some images and try to remove it. No error there.\nIf you mean something different, could you create a playground for your case? It will be easier to troubleshoot.\n. Where do you want to show it?\n. You can send back location for the uploaded image file and show it. Just like that.\n. Plupload doesn't support FileSystemObject directly, but it accepts regular Blob, so if you could find a way to convert FileSystemObject to a Blob, you can make this work.\n. image/gif is not a supported image type currently, consider png or jpeg maybe.\nI'm throwing together Plupload Playground site currently, which is available at http://play.mytunes.ge for now (it will be ported to play.plupload.com as soon as possible). Could you create a case there - it will be easier to troubleshoot. You can take this one as example: http://play.plupload.com/v/4\n. Crap, my deployment script just re-wiped the whole database. Hope you didn't close the page with your playground yet? Can you quickly copy/paste it to a fresh one? Just do not close it, as it's not in database anymore...\nSorry.\n. Also if you depend on jQuery be sure to choose some old versions, since new ones have dropped support for older IEs.\n. Our playground site has move to a permanent location at: http://play.plupload.com.\n. Could you come up with an actual case here: http://play.plupload.com/. This is going to become Plupload Playground very soon, but it's quite functional already and might help to troubleshoot it better.\n. Issues are solved here, generic topics usually discussed on forum. \nIf you create a playground with your case, it can be shared. Each fiddle can be opened in blank window and opened on any platform. So it will be easier for us to troubleshoot. The site has been created for this purpose. It's official Plupload Playground. Third party libraries can be attached from the Sidebar Options. It is also possible to load specific version of Plupload. Site undergoes testing at the moment, but it is very much usable already.\nOur playground site has moved to a permanent location at: http://play.plupload.com.\n. You can achieve the same thing by requesting send_browser_cookies feature in required_features option. However this will explicitly switch Flash runtime to the mode that is not usable for large files, as it requires the whole file to be loaded in memory first. This is because default mode doesn't send cookies. But if you do not use Flash runtime or aren't going to upload large files, it is the option that you should use.\njavascript\n...\nbrowse_button: 'uploader',\nurl: \"upload.php\",\nrequired_features: {\n     send_browser_cookies: true\n},\n...\nThis will internally set withCredentials to true.\nYou can read more about required features and operational modes here.\n. I will close this one.\n. Can you elaborate on why changing interval might matter?\n. Multi file selection should be available in HTML5 runtime. Please post your config to help troubleshoot your situation further. Or even better, create a fiddle on our new playground site: http://play.plupload.com and post a link to it here.\n. Plupload is just file uploader (with some secondary features).  Additional functionality can be programmed on top of our Core API.. Fixed in 2.3.1.. Why would there be a space at the end of the file?. Post your config please.\n. Simply make sure that dynamic DOM element already exists by the time you initialise Plupload.\n. The big point about Plupload is that it should be compatible with legacy browsers. Old jQuery versions are kept on purpose, 'cause versions have dropped support for old IEs for example.\nBy the way, why does your pull request span over so many commits? Updating jQuery versions should have been an atomic change.\n. Do you use chunking? And are you sure that it's HTML5 runtime?\n. Can you post your config? I will try to repeat it.\n. @denzils I'm afraid this is not possible in Plupload 2, for number of reasons. Plupload 3 is in beta right now.\nBut in any case you will need some additional measures on server-side for this to work correctly, as you won't be guaranteed anymore that chunks will arrive in sequential order.\n. I believe, if you require to differentiate, you will simply have to initialise Plupload instances separately. Maybe have a custom initPlupload(id) method that will do this for you.\n. I will post updates on this in: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1332.\n. I'm afraid this is expected behavior. It followed Plupload historically and probably won't change. So basically there are several ways to attach event listeners: in the config, before you call uploader.init() and after you call uploader.init(). The last one is the safest, however if you need to intervene and cancel default event handlers for example, or get the early error notifications like in your case, you need to either attach your listeners in the config or before invocation of uploader.init().. And what kind of encryption would you expect to happen?\nIn general if you are aware of any client-side encrypting libraries that operate on blobs, you could simply extract the blob from each chunk, give it to the encrypting library, retrieve the result (as blob or binary string) and pass it back to Plupload to upload. This scenario is already possible.\n. If you have any file filters in your config try to disable them and see if it helps. There might be a mismatch in mime-types.. https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/278. Plupload is now AMD/CommonJS compatible. And available through NPM and Bower. Should be enough to be harvestable by Angular?\n. Recent versions of Plupload do not rely on mime-types anymore and filter by extension directly. So this shouldn't be a problem anymore.. Do you mean v2.1.2?\nTry to load unminified versions of scripts (moxie.js and plupload.dev.js) that come with the package and see if you get more meaningful error.\n. It doesn't seem to be a regular case. We have a playground here: http://play.plupload.com/, can you file your case and post a link here? We will troubleshoot it.\n. Try to put a little timeout in your autoupload() method, like this:\n```javascript\nvar autoupload = function(uploader, files) {\n    debugger;\n    common_ajax.successF(\"uplaod\",\"begin uplaod\uff01\");\n// set a little delay to make sure that QueueChanged triggered by the core has time to complete\nsetTimeout(function() {\n    uploader.start();\n}, 10);\n\n};\n``. We do not have control over this. I believe it automatically opens the last used location.\n. Still not sure about iOS bug (having trouble to replicate it), however @zhongtianxie your issue seems unrelated. Please open separate ticket and provide more information, since in general Plupload works ok in Safari 9.x on Mac OS X.\n. We now have a playground here: http://play.plupload.com/. So you can provide an exact code there to replicate your problem.\n. If the cause for this is that issue that @wwwdata described, then it will be addressed in the bugfix release that is coming out on monday.. The point of passingthiswas that it adapted to whatever was the environment. In browser it was becomingwindow` automatically. What exactly has changed could you please help to understand?\n. I can't merge your pull request, since it fails in some other scenarios. But thank you for suggestion. I've implemented the fix in v2.2.0.\nWould you be so kind and test if it works?\n. Update in: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1332\n. Regular Moxie.swf is not CDN friendly (for security purposes). We do bundle CDN friendly version in the Plupload package though - Moxie.cdn.swf. Try it instead.\n. I think it simply expects extension to be the last thing in the filename.\n. Did adding image/jpg mime-type solve the problem?. @colorwin sorry not familiar with wechat is it messaging app? does it use Plupload to upload something?. image/jpg is kind of invalid mime-type, that's why I was wondering. Can you specify an exact platform that has these problems all the time? So that we could reproduce the problem reliably.\n@suhaotian what was the Android platform in your case?. @suhaotian so wechat's webview bug for some reason requires invalid jpeg mime type (image/jpg)?\nAlso do you know if this happens with other file types, or only - jpegs?. If you have any filter in your Plupload config, disable them. Otherwise it is something in the system.. You can set file name on moxies File object before you feed it to moxies FormData.\n. @ShangXinbo please close this ticket, if @clywind suggestion is sufficient.\n. If you know what you are doing you could wrap it quickly yourself. Currently we do not provide it ourselves. But I'm thinking to incorporate a wrapper for AMD, CJS and apparently CMD as well for Plupload 3, which is in beta at the moment.\n. AMD/CommonJS support now in v2.2.0.\n. Well... relativePath is not guaranteed and is only available when you drag and drop whole folder. It is browser security constraint, not Pluploads.\n. Not even sure that we can affect this in any way. I'm open to suggestions.\n. @lancocos, Hm... I fixed formatting in your initial comment and noticed something. What exactly are you trying to achieve with **zip**?\n. You should put this part:\njavascript\n       var uploader = initPlupload({\n            url:fileUploadUrl,\n            browse_button : options.selectBtn,\n            init: {\n                            some method;\n             }\n        });\nin your ajax success handler. 'cause otherwise fileUploadUrl is going to be empty by the time you initialize Plupload (ajax is async - remember?).\nAlso for it to work in IE9, you need to have Flash and make sure that paths to flash shim (Moxie.swf) is correct and it is retrieved and loaded in correctly.\n. Sorry, having hard time to grasp the problem. Could you describe your case in your native language and then use Google Translate maybe to communicate it?\n. Post your Plupload config please.\n. Sorry, still not getting the essence of the problem. You shouldn't browse anywhere while the tab/page is uploading or upload will fail. Or is it that you can't browse in other browser tabs/windows while upload is happening?\n. Are you sure those paths to swf and xap shims are correct?\n. I can't tell if the path is correct or not like this. Copy/paste it into your browsers address bar and see if swf gets retrieved.\nThere are only two reasons why Flash might not initialize: \n- path is not correct\n- your browser either doesn't have Flash plugin or it is outdated\nAs for #1267 problem, solution is described in that thread.\n. Which iOS version is it?\n. If it's still an issue, I'd suggest to remove the filter altogether, since it's something that is beyond our control.. Why would you want to use a Plupload then? Simply add regular input[type=\"file\"] fields to your form and that should do.\n. We could not find a clean enough way to test file picker either. Basically because it is not possible to programmatically trigger browse dialog in Flash/Silverlight and some legacy browsers (we got to take them into account).\n. Glad you found a solution. I will close this one then. \n. Seems to work. Can you elaborate on what doesn't work? Would be helpful if provide failing case here: http://play.plupload.com\n. Yeah, that's kind of serious problem with all fiddles using library files from master branch. Since some of our recent releases were made from other branches...\nI should probably say that jsFiddle is not our fiddler of choice for Plupload (as well as any other fiddlers around the web), since it doesn't support legacy browsers and Plupload is all about legacy browsers. So we developed our own Playground here: http://play.plupload.com.\n. The problem wasn't the plupload.full.min.js itself but the fact that fiddle was using older version of it.\n. Related: http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=15103\n. Sorry, could you post a name of the browser in which it fails? And maybe a link where we could download it?\n. Could you post your Plupload config? And server-side handler code as well?  And browser (model, version, os).\n. From your front-end code it is not clear if you handle errors in any way, do you? Plupload doesn't react automatically to server responses, be it JSON like the following: '{\"error\" : {\"code\" : \"101\", \"message\" : \"U moet ingelogd zijn om deze functie te kunnen gebruiken.\"}}', XML, or plain text. It simply passes those to corresponding event handlers. Check documentation for FileUploaded and ChunkUploaded for example.\nI also suggest you to try to upload without a session check and see if it makes any difference.\n. It has hard to tell what went wrong from that code. We have a Plupload playground here: http://play.plupload.com/. Consider creating a test case, where you can reproduce a problem.\n. @ShangXinbo did you manage to solve this one?. Are you using a Widget or your own custom implementation of our Core API?\n. Widgets do not have support for such. But if you implement something on top of our Core API, you could come with anything you would require.. What do you mean by clipping? It is possible to crop the image to exact dimensions.\n. You shouldn't be using v1.2.1. It's deprecated. For quite some time actually.\n. It is not helpful if you do not provide either code or link. Doesn't happen here for example: http://play.plupload.com/g9_J_/1\n. master branch is currently disfunctional. I will merge this on 2.2.x.\n. Has been addressed in 2.3.3.. If image fails to be resized, it will be uploaded as is. Or it is something else that you are interested in?\n. Hi Emma, in fact it is already possible to cancel current upload and our widgets have a corresponding button. Could you perhaps post your Plupload initialization code, for me to advice you further?. What version of Plupload are you using?. Can you post your Plupload config? 'cause I can't reproduce that error.. I've published v2.2.1, that should have this fixed.. Yes. mOxie provides all the runtimes to Plupload.. FileReader is not supported by html4 (here's the list of supported features by runtime). But the error that you get is unrelated. In default build we got rid of o. and mOxie. namespaces, 'cause users were complaining that we were polluting global namespace with aliases.\nFileReader can be accessed through moxie.file.FileReader().\nIf you still require mOxie namespace, repository should be compiled with compat=yes argument. Or you can simply use v2.1.9 (we will be releasing a bugfix release v2.2.1 these days anyway).. I should say I never tested chunks of such size. It might be that firefox itself fails to slice them (non HTML5 runtimes will definitely fail).. We've removed mOxie namespace (as well as o. namespace) in v2.2.x, 'cause there were complaints about global namespace pollution on our side. And we agreed. It is still possible to compile in that missing compatibility shim or to include it manually (it's just small wrapper script that can be found here for example).\nBut in your case you can instead simply do: plupload.ua.swf_url = './flash/Moxie.min.swf';. Since both mOxie.Env and plupload.ua are basically aliases to: moxie.core.utils.Env.\n. That's not informative at all. I guess you better describe what has happened in your own words.. Ok, I see why it fails now. Need to bear it in mind for some time. Easy fix for this though, would be to map ip to domain and use domain instead.. This has been addressed in: moxiecode/moxie@b01cd60. However it will only be released with 2.3, which is almost ready. For now you could build moxie yourself and substitute Pluploads version with your own.. @KalpanaPagariya, yes, if you can find it there.. @KalpanaPagariya no. You are free to make fixes and use it accordingly. In case you find it appropriate to contribute back, I'd gladly consider pulling it in as well.. @eugef we did move them on 2.2.x branch.. Yes, this week probably.. Hm... haven't tried Electron myself. Do you have a lasting successful experience with it?. In recent releases couple of issues were addressed to make Plupload (and underlying mOxie core) wrappable under non-global environments. It's fully compatible with Webpack now for example.  I've still haven't tried it in Electron though. Would mind to have s quick go on it with the latest version?. It is expected. Browser does this. We do not have control over this unfortunately.. What version of IE? Do the examples work for you in IE?. Can you post your config? There are several reasons why it might be happening. But in general it shouldn't.. Basically it all boils down to capabilities of the browser to slice file to chunks and upload them. IE11 might be simply slower at doing this.\nIf you plan to upload big files regularly, I'd suggest to increase the chunk_size to something bigger, like 100mb for example.. @HXO-OXH have you tried solution from: https://www.zhihu.com/question/54623070?. Closing this as duplicate for: #1397.. Obviously whichever image loads first also displays first, since your code handles them in parallel. If you want to preserve order you should handle them sequentially - not load second image until first is done. But it is generic javascript topic and not Plupload issue.\nAlso I don't quite understand what are you doing there. By using plupload.addFile you are re-adding the file to the queue and it will be re-uploaded once you start the uploader. Is it what you expect?. It is supported by underlying core engine - moxie. But is not implemented in Plupload. The problem with the folder picker is that it cannot pick files when it is configured as folder picker. So one will need two separate buttons, or a dropdown with two separate options.\nAre you using a widget or Plupload core directly?. @KalpanaPagariya which version of Plupload do you use? Mentioned vulnerabilities have been resolved and are not present in the latest version. . Is there any reason why you do not upgrade? 2.1.9 was security update for example.. To address those XSS issues you need to take at least updated Moxie.swf shim from 2.1.9 version. . Seems a problem with 2.3.0. Can you confirm that you do not observe such issue in previous versions?. I've actually published v2.3.1 right away, since this was basically a breaking regression. Could you try it out?. It seems to be a minification bug there (not sure why uglify did that). Try dev version.. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1446.\n. There was a regression, that we now fixed and released 2.3.1.. There should not be any problem in general. We do have Plupload running over HTTPS in multiple places.\nCan you post your config?. 1.x branch is officially deprecated, and you do not seem to have even the latest version in that branch (I believe the last one was 1.5.8). We highly recommend to upgrade. In majority of cases there shouldn't be any problem, as APIs are mostly equivalent. And you do not even seem to use flash/silverlight shims (they should be directly referenced in the config for the 1.x branch if you do). You can read briefly about the differences in this old writeup from the forum: http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=2528.. Are you running it in standalone IE8 or it is it's virtual or simulated version? Also does it happen for you on the Plupload site as well?\nopacity rule doesn't work in IE8, but in old IEs we use their proprietary filters to achieve the same effect. So it shouldn't be a problem in general.. Plupload applies opacity to it's own structures by itself, you do not need to do anything. But yes, that's the rule:\nfilter : \"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(opacity=0)\". Feel free to reopen if you need a followup.. Sorry, it was a mistake. I will re-add it of course.. Done.. Are you using the latest stable version of Plupload? We've addressed related problem in one of the bugfixes.. Try to add jpeg extension to your list of extensions as well.. @Stiofan have you tried v2.3.1?. @KalpanaPagariya are you replying to upload request with UploadActionxxxx.json? If yes then I'd suggest to send it back with text/json header, rather than application/json, which is known to `cause the effect similar to yours.. Do you mean if you rename it to have mp4 extension it becomes a valid video file?\nHow do you handle uploaded files on the server?. Are you using one of the bundled widgets, or do you have your own implementation on top of the Core API?\nI'm not sure I understood what you are trying to do, but files are sent using the field having file_data_name value as a name, which by default is equal to file. The options are documented here: http://www.plupload.com/docs/v2/Options#file_data_name.. Hidden input element is not always present. For third party runtimes like Flash/Silverlight there's no form element at all. So it's just a way to get hold of the files. \nHowever if you are building your implementation on top of the Core API, you can easily integrate uploader in any HTML structure, with labels and any other elements, that you find appropriate.. I guess I will be adding an option to disable that.. Basically I'm making fit option to work with resize as well (until now it functioned only with crop). So if fit=false, upscale won't happen.. Cannot immediately see why that might be happening. Were you using a dev version maybe?. v.3.1.0 is marked as pre-release (not ready for production). But it is an obvious bug.. ?. Not exactly clear where you are trying this. In one of the examples maybe?. Are you using UI widget?\n. Speed is calculated in uploader.total.bytesPerSec.. If you define what files to select and omit .exe from the list, user generally won't be able to to select those. How this is not the same feature that you request?. Runtime is set after Plupload is initialised. You should check for it not after uploader.init() but from the PostInit event handler.\nHere is an example: http://play.plupload.com/m__J_/3. @nguyenj are you also requiring moxie separately? Plupload already includes one, so FIle objects in Plupload are constructed with one constructor and then you are feeding it to another instance of moxie which compares it against it's own constructor and fails in that. At least that's what is happening for me. I guess I need to replace instanceof check with something else and also expose Plupload's own moxie, so that one wouldn't require to include another one manually. . So once moxie is exposed under plupload namespace, instead of: const moxie  = require('libs/moxie');, one would do const moxie = plupload.moxie;. We do not constrain file selection on Android in any way. Also we cannot affect default file picker.. Flash is disabled in Chrome by default. That might the reason for that error. I wouldn't recommend flash runtime in Chrome anyway. Use html5 wherever possible.. I came to a conclusion that it not possible to have this in 2.x, because of the unfortunate architecture, where every uploaded chunk or file makes use of single global xhr instance. I mean one still might organize some workarounds, but neither of them is perfect or at least applicable in a production.\nI'm preparing 3.1.1 release, that will have this and also other bounties.. Sorry, could you translate those error messages at least? And perhaps describe what you are trying to do exactly?. Config looks  ok, so it should just work. Not sure if flash or silverlight shims will work in webview though. Do they?. What version of IE? Also are you able to upload files in general, but fail if there are more than 1300 files in the queue, or upload in IE fails all the time?\nPost your config or consider creating a fiddle here: http://play.plupload.com.. Crap, I wish I have looked into PRs earlier. Didn't know that replacing self-closing anchor with a proper one does solve the problem.. Oh... I wish I had looked at this one earlier :/ It's not only readme. Had to fix this in all wiki pages as well. Thanks for taking your time though to PR this.. I believe this has been resolved through customer support now?. Plupload can receive server response in FileUploaded or Error events. How do you communicate the message exactly?. There is no such method. Consider adding references to some global registry and then removing them, when necessary.. Are you able to load any other php file?. Currently there is no way to obtain these. But you can build your own implementation on top of Plupload core - mOxie.. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1304. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1064. This is an interesting issue, that I thought would never arise... like - why would anyone want to use flash runtime in React environment?.. Why do you by the way?\nThe problem is caused by two facts: \n1. flash requires some global callback to notify an uploader that it has been successfully initialised.\n2. when plupload is imported like that, it has no global namespace, hence flash has nothing to report to.\nIf you absolutely require flash to function in such environment consider replacing an expected global callback with your own:\n```javascript\nimport plupload from 'plupload' //node_module @2.3.1 use with React\nwindow.flash_callback_with_unique_name = function (event) {\n    plupload.Uploader.prototype.dispatchEvent(event);\n};\nplupload.ua.global_event_dispatcher = 'flash_callback_with_unique_name';\nconst uploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n    container:  'container',\n    browse_button: 'browsebtn',\n    runtimes: 'flash',\n    multipart: true,\n    chunk_size: '0',\n    url: uploadUrl,\n    flash_swf_url: '/plupload-2.3.1/js/Moxie.swf'\n});\nuploader.init();\n``. Can you post your config or better provide your case here: http://play.plupload.com?. @ymecho from what I see progress is not reported for you, because your config makes Plupload to fallback tohtml4runtime, which cannot provide progress. I'd suggest to movehtml4` to the end of the runtime list, like this: \nruntimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight,html4'\nThis way Plupload will first try flash, then silverlight and if they both fail, will fallback to html4.\nYou will also need to define flash_swf_url and silverlight_xap_url in your config.. Here's simplified fiddle for your code: http://play.plupload.com/p__J_/8 (I had to remove undefined blocks, progress is reported to the console - old IEs do not have console, so be sure to alter it accordingly).. Post the output of phpinfo() please.. To remove Symfony from equation, I'd suggest that you create simple upload case (take custom.html and upload.php from examples folder for example) and try to upload directly, bypassing Symfony.\nAlso post your config here please. . Got sent for me. 745mb. \nFirst time I picked up .mp4, which was obviously not allowed file type, but then I zipped and it got through. Have you tried some other big file? Maybe that file is somehow troublesome by itself.\n\n. @xiranst you didn't mention firefox initially, can you bring back that url so that I could try it again?. I just noticed that you are using v3.0-beta1. Use last stable version from 2.x branch instead, which is 2.3.1.. If you are trying to get hold of uploader object below, do it like this:\nvar uploader = $(\"#fileupload\").plupload('getUploader');. I've created a fiddle from your code here: http://play.plupload.com/o__J_/2. Are you able to reproduce the error there? If yes, please outline the steps required.. There will be a bugfix this week.. Potentially it is possible, but Plupload itself doesn't come with a visual cropper/resizer.. We are considering to close the forum on plupload.com, since it is mostly used by spammer human-bots with an alarming intensity. \nI'd suggest to post your questions on StackOverflow and tag them with plupload tag instead. For issues we have this bugtracker on github.. It is not hacked. We've simply closed new registrations. I'm not sure why you weren't able to login, maybe you've used the wrong password. I'm looking into the password reset problem.. @MatsSvensson maybe try now? I was able to successfully reset my passowrd and log in.. Forum will stay where it is, since as @MatsSvensson has mentioned - lots of info there. But I guess we will close it for new registrations for now. Everybody, use StackOverflow with #plupload tag.. What plupload version do you use? And what is the error you encounter?. I cannot reproduce it in 2.3.1, so I guess I will close this for now. Feel free to re-open, with more details or fiddle.. How big is the file that you are trying to preview?. Can you put that image somewhere? I will troubleshoot it. But to be honest it might easily be hitting browsers limits there.. @xiaoyuit what exactly your solution does and how it is supposed to ease your problem?. It took me forever to download that file, browser got halted even when trying to simply enlarge it, I guess no surprise that it has problems to convert it to dataUrl and then preview it.\nIf previewing a blob does solve the problem for you, you can bypass dataUrl (FileReader) step altogether, as our Image wrapper can load blobs directly. So consider something like this: http://play.plupload.com/5__J_. There was a problem with fiddle url, try now.. Did the fiddle solve your problem?. Ok, that image seems too big (13956x6978),  internally there's  a constraint on image supported dimensions 8192x8192, if either side of the image is bigger than that moxie.image.Image will fire an error.\nI need to reconsider that though, since modern browsers can handle higher  dimensions. . Preview generation for large images should be much faster now in 2.3.3. However in underlying Image handler there's still a built-in constraint of 8192x8192. However it can be worked around by manually enlarging the boundaries. Check this updated playground for  reference: http://play.plupload.com/5__J_/2. I would suggest that you try our sample upload.php first (to exclude other factors). It has CORS related code commented out by default, so be sure to uncomment it.\nOPTIONS header is sent by browser, not by Plupload, so your server-side handlers should be ready for it and respond accordingly.. To my memory this is first time this error is reported. Also I doubt it has something to have with Plupload specifically.\nCould you try to upload with the same setup and config to the same destination via Chrome's Incognito mode?. @jingjiewei thanks for further feedback.\nI don't see why it should not work on iPad, could you provide your full config? We have Plupload playground here: http://play.plupload.com.. Somewhere next week I think.. What version of plupload do you use?. There were some efforts to make it work, but they turned out inconsistent on 2.x branch, because of the initial architecture.\nIt is possible on 3.x branch, by intercepting a chunk, processing it according to S3 Multipart requirements and then continuing the upload.\nWe are releasing v2.3.2 today. And stable v3.1.1 should follow somewhat later this week. Once it's out I will prepare a demo for S3 Multipart.. * What's the version of you Plupload?\n What the client-side platform that does that?\n Can you share problematic images?\n* Could you post your Plupload config or even better create a case in our playground?. Some versions of Android were having similar issue I think, but we were never able to replicate it. Having original image would help immensely. Could you ask your client to send it to you maybe? Also Plupload 2.3.3 uses somewhat different resizing algorithm, so upgrading might help, unless it's a device level bug that has to be worked around specifically.. Can you replicate the problem in our playground? Or at least describe your case in more detail.. Could you also provide a setup here: http://play.plupload.com?. Not able to make it crash in IE11 on Windows 10. What is your OS? Are you testing it through VM maybe?. I've reordered your fiddle a bit: http://play.plupload.com/6__J_/2.. Hm... seems that IE10 and early versions of IE11 do not support blob: uris as a source for the image. Interesting how Microsoft managed to land two incompatible versions of IE11.. It seems that blob uris are unreliable in older IE11 and IE10 and since there's basically no way to intercept the failure, I think I will simply mark the feature as not available in those browsers.. When your modal is ready, rendered and visible, try to call uploader.refresh().\nYou should have a handler attached to error event to capture one if it occurs.. Tried it in both - IE11 and Edge, seems to work. Do you drag the file from the desktop and it fails to drop into the UI, or what exactly doesn't work?. Sorry, not sure what you mean by dragging from browse file. Do you mean from file explorer?\nExample that you reference is configured to filter all files except images and zip archives (check the config). I've modified an example to accept .mp4 now, try it out: http://play.plupload.com/y/5.. Browser dialogs are for picking files not dragging them over. If you are looking to drag the file open File Explorer.. Seems to work here.. How big is the folder? Bear in mind that Plupload has to cycle through each and every file in the folder in its subfolders... and subfolders of subfolders.. For every processed file we fire FileFiltered event, perhaps you could use it show some feedback.. Try:\njavascript\nresize : {\n    width : 1024, \n    height : 1024, \n    quality : 90,\n        fit: false\n},. This has been fixed. Thanks.. Related: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1525. It works fine in our tests. Could you provide a case in our playground, here: http://play.plupload.com?. You could have saved that case on the playground site and post a link to it here instead of screenshot and code.. docx files in general upload just fine. Please provide your config, Plupload version and browser model/version where you observe the problem.. Can you post your code/config? Actually would be great if you could reproduce it in our playground: http://play.plupload.com.. @jerryluo wow, that's the bug I guess. So Safari in iOS 11 still doesnt' support extensions in accept attribute? How lame.... Here is the commit with the fix: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/commit/0aeef7876b4eaf7a65c0bacacd34f4992e80c648. You could patch it yourself in the source. \nFix will be incorporated into the next bug release.. Could you post your config or better create a fiddle in our playground: http://play.plupload.com?. It might be something with your HTTP server, Which one are you making use of?. It is possible - yes. Checkout this fiddle. More info available at: Image Resizing on Client-Side.. It was never meant to be used in production out of the box. Also it is not recommended in general to allow php (or any other executable files) files to be uploaded into your document root.. Do you mean your implementation doesn't work with v3.x? In last 3.x version we've exposed whole moxie namespace under plupload.moxie (to avoid over-polluting plupload namespace directly).. This is default and expected behaviour - smaller images are upscaled to match the dimensions in the resize option. Try to set fit to false.\njavascript\nresize: {\n    width: 800,\n    height: 800,\n    resample: 'bilinear',\n    preserve_headers: false,\n    fit: false,\n    quality: 90\n},\n. Can you please provide more details on this one? We've not created any composer packages for Plupload ourselves.. We do not impose any headers on the uploads ourselves. There might be some added by the runtimes (Flash does that definitely). Other than that headers on the customer side can be added through the headers option.. Which front-end do you mean? How does conflict manifest itself?. Hm... actually it's an unfortunate omission.. Could you translate this please? Also make sure that you do not extra comma anywhere in your config. IE8 and below crash on that.. GIFs are not being considered images by Plupload, only JPEGs and PNGs.. It isn't clear when or why you do a redirect. Are you redirecting to upload handler or from upload handler?. Sorry I still don't understand the flow. Why should page refresh? Whole point of Plupload is to upload without refreshes.. We do not accept PRs to i18n packs from GitHub, sorry. You can contribute through Plupload page on Transifex though.. No. Uploading multiple files via single request is not supported.. This one makes sense.\n. ",

    "avel": "Indeed, only browserplus supports this.\nThis issue is marked as closed; does this mean that the feature is not on the developers' roadmap?\nEssentially, the issue here is using the Directory API of BrowserPlus and passing along the path property to the server side.\n. I am also using a custom uploader, with html4 as an option. While other runtimes work correctly, in html4 all I get on server-side is one single line of the multipart/form-data MIME boundary and nothing else.\nI am continuing to investigate the issue, but so far have come up with nothing.\n. What do you mean the right order? I just tried with plupload 1.2.2.1 and did both of these:\nbuploader.bind('FileUploaded', [...]);\nbuploader.bind('UploadProgress', [...]);\nAND\nbuploader.bind('UploadProgress', [...]);\nbuploader.bind('FileUploaded', [...]);\nwith the exact same results. Binding two different events doesn't change the order in which they are emitted anyway.\nHere is a screenshot of the series of events emitted for a simple file of 7498580 bytes and a chunk size of 1mb:\nhttp://email.uoa.gr/download/misc/plupload_flash_progress_events.png\nWithout chunking the events are similar.\nAll other runtimes provide clear, accurate and nicely-ordered events as far as the 'queue' object is concerned.\nLet me know if you need any more details.\n. To clarify, in my original report I said I was using multipart upload. Now I switched to chunking, which results in a more usable progress bar, but does not solve the event issue.\n. Thank you very much, this made the situation a bit better. I binded these two events after calling init(), and now I get:\n- next-to-last, a FileUploaded event with \"almost done\" queue data (98%)\n- last, an uploadProgress event with everything correct (100%, full byte counts etc)\nI'll see if I can make the FileUploaded event the last one, as it happens with all other runtimes.\n. Interesting, sounds like this is similar to the problem some of us still have at this (\"closed\") issue: http://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/closed#issue/19 \n. What runtime(s) does this happen with?\n. An explanation on why plupload developers chose UrlStream can be found here at the last post:\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=20\nHowever, I would prefer the FileReference API too, since I don't use the image resizing features, HTTP authentication, and I pass the session token in GET parameters anyway.\nIn addition, I believe the Flash runtime at the moment has huge memory usage in Windows & Linux, when uploading large files. I didn't encounter such problems with the YUI flash uploader which used FileReference.\nSo, yes, IMHO perhaps an implementation of FileReference could be reconsidered...\n. Spocke, you mean \"the only way you would ever use FileReference.*\" ? :)\nI understand that that the flash runtime, being (a) the most popular across users (b) the most bug-ridden and (c) the worst vendor-supported (taking years to fix serious bugs) is a PITA, especially compared to BrowserPlus or Gears.\nThat said, you say the goal is to make an upload work the same in all runtimes. It clearly doesn't work at all for large files, the topic of the other bug report.\nOf course, I'm not saying the FileReference.Upload is a much better choice anyway than other runtimes! It took Adobe more than two years to implement smooth progress in their Linux plugin.\nMy point is that as implementors we have to do a special case for flash either way. For instance, now, if we fall back to flash, change the maximum file size and inform the user to install something else if they want larger files.\nAnyway, I'm going to investigate how falling back to YUI uploader in certain cases would affect the nice abstraction achieved through the excellent plupload project. :)\n. Thank you again for your clear answer. Unfortunately I'm not familiar with Flash so I can't contribute to that area.\n. Ah, I just saw that you mentioned this too in this report. I can confirm that the memory usage is indeed huge, in both Windows and Linux.\n. You could also take a look at YUI uploader for a flash-based alternative. That's what I used before switching to plupload, but I used YUI components anyway.\nFor what is worth, with large files I'm having similar problems with the 'html4' and 'html5' plupload runtimes.\nFor instance, in runtime html4, with IE 8, when uploading a large file there is a big memory usage spike. In runtime html5 in Firefox/Linux, Firefox loads the entire file into memory and fails miserably with large files. I've yet to run more tests. I switched to chunking in the hope that it would imporove, with small chunks being uploaded and all, but it didn't help.\n. jayarjo - this topic (flash performance and flash APIs) has been discussed extensively in the forum and in other bug reports and I think the drawbacks of each method are now clear.\nSince you have already implemented uploading via the FileReference class in Flash, which has no issues with performance, I think this topic is now closed and it's up to people to choose what is best for them.\nI think it's safe to close this ticket.\n. In issue #2 ( http://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues#issue/2 ) there is already a link to example code: http://www.angrymonkeys.com.au/blog/2010/02/26/using-plupload-with-asp-net/\n. Could #148 be related to this issue?\n. Which javascripts are you loading and in which order?\n. There's your problem. You don't need to load plupload.gears.js. The aggregate file plupload.full.min.js already has it. Not a bug.\n. URL of the documentation? The examples are correct, and it's common practice with javascript projects to provide a single aggregate + minified file together with separate files for convenience.\n. Are these differences between browsers happening with the same runtime?\nI'm asking this because some inconsistencies with the events emitted have to do with the differences between runtimes, not between browsers with the same runtime.\nIn any case, when reporting a bug, check to see which runtime is being used. If necessary, in your plupload constructor, only define one runtime.\nAlso check out this report of mine from a while back. It was about inconsistencies with the flash runtime:\nhttp://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/closed#issue/37\nAn idea/workaround could be to use the uploadprogress event as it seems to be slightly more consistent. Of course, you'd have to check the totals there to see if the upload has completed. While integrating plupload in my app, I'm using the FileUploaded event only to get the server response, nothing else.\n. Actually I don't. Perhaps it was an edge case with our implementation at a certain point. Mark this as closed.\n. You can enable multipart and use multipart_params. Otherwise set the url with a get parameter when setting up the uploader.\n. I can confirm this.\nWith a flash uploader, in my implementation I had the following issue:\nResize the window before starting an upload; add one file and start uploading; the same file would be uploaded two or three times.\nAnd the logic shown above fixes it.\n. So, with the above fix it works for you, ghost3k? For me it doesn't seem to. (plupload 1.3.0 + your fix).\nMy call stack in Chrome console says this:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getBoundingClientRect' of null\nplupload.getPos lib/plupload/src/javascript/plupload.js:397\n- plupload.runtimes.Html5.plupload.addRuntime.init.uploader.bind.settings lib/plupload/src/javascript/plupload.html5.js:296\n- plupload.Uploader.plupload.extend.trigger lib/plupload/src/javascript/plupload.js:1024\n- (snip)\nThis, with both Google Chrome 7.0.517.44 and Google Chrome 9.* (developer channel) in a Windows 7 machine.\nP.S. this might be unrelated to the safari workaround, just checking with you first.\n. OK, turns out that my issue was a different one. In recent plupload (certainly in 1.3.0 and probably in 1.2.4) the drag'n'drop functionality requires a browse_button setting as well; I'll file a different report for that. (Edit: issue #160)\nSo with that issue resolved for me, I can confirm that the above fix is valid and enables drag'n'drop in both Chrome (7 & 9, dev channel) (in child elements of drop_element) and in Safari, in Windows 7.\n. cj, what I do is call removeFile on the uploader instance.\nHowever I do not use the queue widget so I don't know if this applies there as well. You might want to do something additional there.\nvar mylength, j;\n        // To reset the queue (plupload.total object), basically remove each file from the file que\n        // Queue is \"persistent\": after uploading the files, the data remains there.\n        for(j=0, mylength = up.files.length; j<mylength; j++) {\n            up.removeFile(up.files[0]);\n        }\n. I think I've found a workaround.\nOne can set an appropriate font-size, for the \"Choose...\" text to be shrunk, so that it wont overlap other elements that are next to it.\nUnfortunately the value of text-size is dependant on the actual overlay that is over the hidden \"Choose\" text, and probably also on the locale of the browser (meaning that it might say something different than \"Choose...\").\nSo in my implementation, where I use only a 16x16 icon, a font-size: 1px seems to do the job.\nIn the implementation of the jquery queue widget, something bigger can be used so that the file input browser widget will be under the whole of the button above it.\n. Excellent idea! oveflow:hidden on the form element that is parent to input is much better, because it will use the exact dimensions needed, no more, no less.\nConfirming that it works like a charm. :)\n.

I was under the impression that this is an all jquery plugin.\nIn fact, that's going to make it very hard. For instance handline of the container elements that overlay the browseButton should actually be inserted into the dom tree right after the browse button instead of at the end of the body.\nOverall, it will bloat the code quite a bit for the sake of staying generic ... which it already isnt as far as I see...?\n. Frankly, I've forgotten bare-bones JS over time swimming in jQuery all the time ;)\n. Seems to be something in the plupload.flash.js init(). There's some busy-wait for the object to be loaded. http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/ does better embeding a flash object.\n. Hm, that's not what I want. I do want to select types in the file browser. It defaults to \"All files\". Alas, if I select a SomeFile.foobarextension it won't let it through as the * extension does not sanction it. Simply fixed by adding \nif (extensionsMap && ... && !extenisonsMap['*']) {\n  up.trigger('Error' ...);\n}\n \nin plupload.js' FilesAdded handler.\n. So would you specify file types for the browser dialog (a convenience thingy) without strictly enforcing them by the plupload queue?\n. Sorry to hear you feel stressed out. Maybe I wasn't clear enough. Note, that I have been using the filter param successfully on previous plupload versions to specify a filter dialog for those backends that support it. It stopped working later with the newer code in plupload.js dealing with extensionsMap. I fully understand what you are trying to do here. But IMHO, the issue is covering two use cases affected by the same feature: (1) have a nice filter dialog for file types in the browser for those backends that support it (2) constraint allowed file types to be uploaded. Currently you can't do (1) without also getting (2). This is even when you specify a \"All files\" joker category for the browser dialog. My above mini patch fixes this issue by checking if one of the filters covers the . file type. In this case, the code must not constrain file types  allowed to be uploaded. Am I wrong? \nI hope you will add this fix to the code in one of your next releases as it really addresses an issue.\n. The only solution I've found so far is to add a unique token to the upload url so that different uploaders are distinguishable at the backend. But I guess this should be a build-in feature, enabled by default.\n. > there isn't any issues with overwriting files since no files are uploaded in parallel\nHere's how to reproduce:\n(1) Open up a second window with the same uploader. \n(2) Select the same file\n(3) Click on submit\n(4) Jump to the other window and click on submit there as well\nNow there are two parallel uploads. \n. As I already said in the opening text to this issue: using unique_names will overwrite the original filename, which needs to be preserved in some way and send over to the backend at some point. \nThere are three solutions:\n(1) as things are right now: the filename is replaced with a random one. the original name is submitted to the server together with its randon one after all files have been uploaded as part of the last form submit ... as demonstrated in the example widgets.\n(2) the complete uploader uses a random id in its submit url so that the backend can create a container for all files it receives. this guarantees that files are kept separate on the backend in a secure upload container while the frontend can continue to transmit more files for just this container.\n(3) both - the unique_name as well as the original filename - are transmitted to the server on each file being uploaded.\nI was actually expecting to see something like (3) but am happy to go with (2). There is an important bit that I've been missing so far in (1) that the upload widget will not only send over all individual files but also one last finishing form submit to tell the backend that the complete transaction is over. This last form submit then holds all extra information and filename mapping from orig to temp that it needs to properly finish this upload.\nFrom what I see this isn't a bug, only missing understanding / docu. ;)\n. +1. some of the other engines pass a \"details\" property. this too isn't used everywhere.\n.

The site owners always can offer to use other browser for their clients if they need a better functionality. Anyway it is quiet clear that IE is going to support HTML 5 in sufficient near future too :)\nWhat do you think?\n.

I'm using my version of plupload with html4 (if html5 features are not available, like in IE) and html5 runtimes + node.js (express, node-formidable), client is communicating with a socket.io server, so everything else works perfectly, including file-progress with HTML4, thanks.\nhtml5 works perfectly, but I had to change html4 runtime. In my version, it creates a unique iframe with FILE ID together with upload form. Original code uses 1 iframe with plupload ID.\n. \"It is quite problematic to support this across the runtimes\". I found out that the main problem was uploadNext function in plupload.js. And now I'm using this:\n```\n    function uploadNext() {\n        var file, count = 0, i, len = files.length;\n    if (this.state == plupload.STARTED) {\n        // Upload each file (together)\n        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n            file = files[i];\n            if (this.trigger(\"BeforeUpload\", file)) {\n                this.trigger(\"UploadFile\", file);\n            }\n            ++count;\n        }\n        // All files are DONE or FAILED\n        if (count == len) {\n            this.stop();\n            this.trigger(\"UploadComplete\", files);\n            files = [];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n. Take a look at this site http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/\nAll files are uploading at once using flash player. So simultaneous uploading is not a big problem. If serverside supports it, it'll work\n. I think I know.\nUnfortunately, I don't know ActionScript so I won't be able to help you, but:\nExample of file uploading: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ActionScript/3.0_ProgrammingAS3/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b90204-7cf6.html\nClass that \"provides a means to let users select one or more files for uploading\" http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/FileReferenceList.html\nExample of file uploading using this class: http://creative-geeks.com/blog/2009/05/24/upload-multiple-files-with-actionscript-3/\nAnd take a look: https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI/tree/master The author is a Russian programmer who's working in the largest russian internet company - Mail.Ru Group\nIn his project he's using ExternalInterface to transfer data from Flash to JavaScript.

I think you need ro read this: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload#building-instructions\n. I think you will have to compile moxie for that. https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie#build-instructions\n. In that case you'll have to download a pre-built version from http://www.plupload.com/download.php\n. At Github, its always development version, which you will have to build and use.\nThe link I told you takes you to Plupload Download page which features the latest release. Its the best option to go for in case you are not a developer and don't want to contribute back to the project, but just want to use the product.\n. Plupload 2 is still in development and has not yet been released.\nThe latest release of Plupload is 1.5.7 (as of now)\n. Not sure if that makes any significance. Think it is better to close this issue.\n. Merge it :+1: \n. First impression was due to the just 'a' fix in the doc. But this commit has made quite a lot of significant changes in the doc.\n.

    "Reggino": "We ran into the same issue with the latest version (1.5.4)\nAfter some debugging we found that the html4 runtime in IE6, IE7 and IE8 doesn't use XmlHttp (AJAX), but just submits a form into an iframe. This was a problem, because originally we added content-type application/json to our server-side response and the browser then wanted to download the response. Solution is NOT to add these headers, but just content-type text/plain (or something similar)\nFor more info, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2483771/how-can-i-convince-ie-to-simply-display-application-json-rather-than-offer-to-do\nhth\n. I've found the cause. In File.as the following comment can be found:\n// Force at least 4 chunks to fake progress. We need to fake this since the URLLoader\n// doesn't have a upload progress event and we can't use FileReference.upload since it\n// doesn't support cookies, breaks on HTTPS and doesn't support custom data so client\n// side image resizing will not be possible.\nIt would be nice if this behaviour was configurable. (in our case, we push chunks to Amazon S3 and because of the extra chunks we run into extra, unneeded costs )\n. File upload handling should be no different than the example code provided... This patch doesn't change the upload behavior.\n. (This is actually another issue)\nUnder some circumstances, Flash fails to use the FileReference after it has been selected by the user, using the Flash runtime. Flash internally throws an exception due to security setting, configuration issues or a special filesystem. \nWe noticed there errors in a Citrix environment, on Windows, Internet Explorer 8 where JavaScript started reporting 'unspecified errors' in the use of the external interface of the flash component. (Flash internally throws an exception in File.as, line 335)\nThis patch makes the error catchable in a normal way.\n.

Are you reassembling the chunked image parts into a single file on your server after all the uploads are complete?

The reason 70% of the image is missing is you are only viewing the first chunk.  The other parts aren't viewable because they need to be appended onto that first chunk to be a valid image.\nMany html5 implementations don't support chunking yet, so it might have worked with html5 because plupload wasn't chunking for that runtime (it was just uploading a single larger file).\n.

So basically chunking is not reliable in larger files when using Flash runtime.  That message should be front and center in the documentation.  Yes, this is a limitation of Flash, but it should be plupload's responsibility to inform devs (such as myself who had to learn the hard way after spending a day integration the thing).  A browser crash (which I experienced in IE) is not something I wish my users to experience.\nAnd yeah, using FileReference would avoid this failure.

    "jacobstr": "Running into similar issues intermittently on the boss's laptop. An earlier comment in issue #36 proposed adding a height to the div. Seems irrelevant but I'll try it.\nJust confirming however, that it does seem to be an issue. \nI'll try to get a list of extensions installed in his Firefox for you, as well as anything else you suggest that might be helpful.\n. Visibility hidden isn't an effective workaround as the element still takes up space in the page. css({'visibility' : 'hidden' , 'position': 'absolute'}) perhaps.\n. It gets reinitalized via:\nLine 50 plupload.flash.js\nWhen you press the upload button and make your selection, you get multiple uploads. If you've toggled the element twice, you'll get two copies per file.\n. The combination of visibility:hidden and position:absolute causes the same behavior as display:none.\nvisibility:hidden by itself doesn't exhibit the issue.\nSo effectively that's not a workaround. Attempted with position fixed as well. The only other option might be something like setting a negative margin based on the calculated height of the element before hiding it but that's probably edge-case salad.\nCan't the event handlers simply be unbound before reinitialization? \n. Just some notes: from what I could tell in Firebug, it doesn't seem like the events are bound multiple times, rather they get triggered additional times each time it's re-instantiated.\nIt seems like there's clean-up between re-initializations that it could be doing.\nAnother workaround I had considered was putting it in a jQuery ui dialog that opens when you click an \"Upload..,\" button, but it would likely have the same issue.\n.

Not exactly using that tus.io as i dont wanna resume whole file, append it and so on, just resend whole chunk...\n(I am joing the chunks after all have been sent properly and my sha1 for each chunk is same as the ones i got from client).\nThis also could be later used for retrieving files form more than one person at time (telling them to send different chunks).\n. How it can be duplicate of something that was created AFTER?\n. Maybe we all should use some strange methods for duplication?

So maybe stick to the definitions and not make your own?  -  just not random thought.\nAlso this issue is still available on newer version of the library than i had reported - so no one even tried to fix that.

    "DaveVdE": "I don't really see why checking the server is really necessary. All I need is the ability detect a failed upload due to a failed chunk and the ability to restart uploading from that failed chunk. The server won't mind if I send a chunk twice, especially if the last one didn't get through because of a network issue, and the server still keeps track of which file I was uploading by the file id that gets sent to the server.\nThis 'tus' thing seems a bit overkill for my needs.\n. TUS requires as much server side as it requires client side. I suppose if plupload supports the client side matters that I'd take the effort to implement it server side. But everyone has a different server story.\n. Well, TUS is a protocol that is different from the well established FORM POST uploads of today. If I want to use it in my product or project in ASP.NET, I'll have to implement the server side. Also, I would need some kind of tracking in a database to keep tabs on what's being uploaded, retention, that sort of thing. \nEverybody's story will be different. I don't think it's too complicated to implement the server side part with MVC or Web API, or even the new ASP.NET Core, so if plupload supports the client side, I might be persuaded to use it and implement the server side myself. Don't know if I'd do it openly though, perhaps a blog post should suffice to explain it.\n. No, I use my own handler in ASP.NET Web API.\n. No, I'm sure that's not the case.

Since I'm using Chrome 6, it would be a time saving option, although I agree it's a more restricted environment.\nThank you for the heads up and congrats for this work.\n. Hmm, it seems like the drag and drop issue is only verified on the jquery widget example.\nUsing the \"all runtimes\" example, I can see that the HTML5 one has a \"drag files here\" help text. Effectively, I can confirm drag and drop is working on this runtime using Google Chrome 6.0.408.1 and Firefox 3.6.3 on OSX.\nEdit: html source indicates that the jquery widget is using the Flash runtime, hence why drag and drop is not working there.

The only thing not working is the event bindings which occur after the upload button is clicked, in your example 0% occurs but not 1,2,3 etc.  On the server the file does get uploaded.\nThose bindings are important though for most features.

I wish I had an easy way to send you an example you could run.  Ill see about spinning up an example on a public facing server.\nI've fixed a slew of problems and realized flash wasn't working in ff3 for my application either.  After some tweaking I fixed afew surface problems.\nNow at the same point ie gives me a IOError.  FF says \"uncaught exception: Error calling method on NPObject! [plugin exception: Error in Actionscript. Use a try/catch block to find error.].\"\nThe swf is loading properly and its being served so it doesn't look like it local.

It seems like its breaking when FileUploaded is called for the 2nd file in the list.\nBoth files have the same name, size, and loaded amount.  The 1st has status 5 and the 2nd has status 2.\nHere is the file with most of the js related to plupload:\nhttp://bitbucket.org/copelco/django-file-picker/src/tip/sample_project/media/js/file-picker.js\nStarting at line 134 I call plupload, its basically a direct copy of your code from there.\n. I realized that the init trigger seems to get triggered twice when using the flash and only once when using html5.\nIs this expected behaviour.  The only code which calls init only gets run once so its very strange.\nSince init gets called twice then it should add ever image twice correct?\n. So I figured out the problem In PostInit i call run this command\n$('div.plupload').css({'position': 'fixed'});\nSo the button shows up in the right place and that cuases init to run.  I have no clue why unless init is set to run whenever that changes\n. But $('div.plupload').css({'position': 'fixed'}); only causes init to run if its flash.\n.

Problem still exists in 1.4.0\njayarjo:\nThe problem with getting the upload url's before the user starts the actual upload is the upload url is \"short\" lived.  When you ask Google App Engine for a upload url, it gives one back that you have to use within a certain amount of time.  If I'm uploading 100 image files, the upload url might expire before I get to the last one.  So the best place to get the upload url (with a async ajax request) is right before actually uploading each file... i.e. right before \"UploadFile\" is triggered... but currently as of 1.4.0, there is still no way of delaying \"UploadFile\" from being triggered in uploadNext().\n. I think that's going to make it very convoluted for a user to do this. \nA simpler solution would be to make a setting to disable the call to this.trigger(\"UploadFile\", file); around line 809.  That should be enough. Since we could then catch \"BeforeUpload\", do our work, and then trigger \"UploadFile\" ourselves, when we are ready.\n. ",

    "Drachenfels": "Hi,\nI guess I can have very similar issue. It happens with firefox 3.6 at windows (linux version is working just fine, also chrome on both windows and linux is fine). You can easly reproduce it at page:\nhttp://www.pennysaverusa.com/adplacement/\nFollow the path to reproduce:\n1. scroll down to the very bottom of that page\n2. click radio \"I'm a PrivateParty\"\n3. try to upload an avatar (should not work)\n4. scroll up (you must see top of the page)\n5. scroll down\n6. click upload again (now it should work)\nSome extra information. After clicking PrivateParty the form is populated by jquery plugin called 'templates' by Microsoft:\nhttp://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/\nForm has a lot and alot of jquery actions, also there is some form validation, dom manipulations and etc etc. Thus I'm refreshing location of a flash uploader very frequently. In fact I'm refreshing it after every 80ms or so. Also when you scroll up but you did not scroll down, uploader will be binded to some random place (sometimes it's a label with steps, sometimes it's description, sometimes it's right away moved at proper location on the bottom).\nI would appreciate if someone is able to look at this issue.\n. P.S.\nI just get rid of frequent refreshes. Flash location was refreshed once, at 0.5 second after template was rendered. It did not help at all. The very same behaviour still observed.\n. Unfortunately the mentioned above linkage was taken down. It was a production server and it had to be fixed. So for firefox and windows html5 runtime is prefered over flash runtime. I also tried to reproduce said above condition in more sterile enviroment but without luck. But my guess would be, possibly when dom is maniulated and/or there is a lot of events (or certain type of event) flash runtime get confused and it fails determine button location.\n. Final update (I guess). Actually I'm able to reproduce that error. Following link:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/196245/test-plupload.html\nWorks well in firefox 3.6.15 at linux, is not working at all at firefox 3.6.15 at windows xp.\n. ",
    "dsteinbrunner": "This is currently documented correctly here:\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Uploader#FileUploaded-event\nIs there another area where this needs correct?\n. I'm using the plupload 1.5.2 UI widget against the the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox on my Mac.  On Chrome and Safari the JSON is wrapped as hujer notes.  Firefox also has the JSON wrapped in a pre tag but with no style.\n. I have reduced down to a upload.php that just sends JSON with failed a status and the example html provided and the pre tag does not appear for me.  That is not the case when the widget is a part of a more complex page and using a custom upload handler not written in php.  For right now I am parsing the pre tag off:\njavascript\nres = res.replace(/^<pre.*>(.+)<\\/pre>$/,'$1');\n. Content-Type:application/json; charset=UTF-8\nThis is being set at lower levels of a framework.\n. I'm going to describe the issues I noticed more in depth just for people that might be running into this.  Originally, I was sending application/json as the content type and was getting the pre tags wrapped in webkit and firefox.  I did not mention that in some or all IE versions I was getting prompted to download the response as a file.  That was no good.  Not sure why but I decided to try text/plain rather than text/html and found that IE would no longer prompt for a download but the pre tag wrapping happen instead.  In at least IE 8 the pre tags were in all caps.  If you for some reason have to stick with that content type then use this revised regex which is case insensitive:\njavascript\nres = res.replace(/^<pre.*>(.+)<\\/pre>$/i,'$1');\nI have since changed to text/html but only for the html4 runtime since application/json works for the other runtimes and is more correct.\n. kysol, thanks for looking at this.  Your correct that that is an issue with the example code I created but when I correct that typo the it did not change the behavior I'm concerned about with the error handling.\n. Since posting this I have also switched to jQuery.parseJSON().\nThe code returning true was not really a problem because my issue is all about reproducing an error situation is not allowing files to be uploaded and hence need to trigger the Error condition.  When things are going well with uploading, I have not problems with the UI Widget.  It is when things are not going well that I'm seeing issues with error handling not reporting to the user correctly and the like.\n. ",
    "aik099": "Was the urlstream_upload option removed in future Plupload versions? I don't see it on http://www.plupload.com/docs/Options page. Is there any way to pass through cookies, when Flash runtime is used?\n. Was the urlstream_upload option removed in future Plupload versions? I don't see it on http://www.plupload.com/docs/Options page. Is there any way to pass through cookies, when Flash runtime is used?\n. :) If possible, then please make this change in upcoming beta release. I think developers, who use Plupload on their websites would be most grateful. At least ones with more specific needs, like me ;)\n. I know, that upload.php can use whatever name he likes to save a file from $_FILES, but problem is on client side. On client side there is no info about fact, that uploaded file was renamed and it still shows original name, that user used when uploading a file. This way generating a thumbnail (on server side) isn't possible, because in thumbnail generation request form client the original (as user uploaded) filename would be sent.\n. In a product I've developed for my company In-Portal CMS (http://www.in-portal.com/), which is open-source too, we're using SWFUpload + JS to allow users to upload files. Then file is sent and resized on server (via PHP), because it's really a server-side business to change files, not client-side.\nHowever over time we're experiencing more and more problems because using Flash technology. I think it's time to move forward and choose solid uploading solution, like Plupload.\nThat's why I'm trying to keep PHP part changes to minimum and just replace JS part with Plupload with custom UI to make transition for existing users as easy as possible.\n. I was looking at http://www.plupload.com/example_events.php and noticed interesting thing: in FileUploaded event in \"info\" argument a complete response from upload.php is available. This way it's technically possible to create whatever action I need with an uploaded file and display my own name in queue (when upload was made).\n. What you're explaining might be actually happening in all other browsers as well. And it might related to queue plugin specifically.\n. This seem to have common root with #816.\n. If I'm not mistaken, then actual XHR making was moved to Moxie component.\n. @jayarjo , empty page there. Not very helpful ;)\n. Chrome has own version of Flash player build-in, regardless of whichever Flash player version you've installed on the system. You choose which flash player to use (system one or build-in) on chrome:://plugins page.\nIf you enable both, then this might result in some unstable behavior.\n. Could you provide more info on the issue. If both webpage and iframe are from same domain, then such type of error never happens. However if you have http:// on one side and https:// on other side (even with same domain) you'll get that error.\n. There are similar issues related to that Flash Player version: #884, #882, #884 that seems to have created a lot of problems to everyone.\n. What exactly \"not working good\" means? File is uploaded or it's not uploaded or it's partially uploaded, etc.\n. Plupload is opensource, so no real expectations can be set on anything. But you can speed up development by buying a paid support I guess. Then from that money they can fix a bug, that matters to you faster. You'd better contact @jayarjo on this subject. I'm just guessing here, that it's possible.\n. It's always possible to come by Apple's Retail Store to try on any device right there.\n. Haven't thought about that, sorry. Surely no such developer-friendly stores here either.\n. Isn't that the same problem as in #815 ?\n. Same on Firefox on Windows 7: http://screencast.com/t/9DTObh4E\nIE 10 on Windows 7 works fine: http://screencast.com/t/iBRHssaBNDx\nChrome on Windows 7 works fine: http://screencast.com/t/wJe0zO1zPS\n. But in uploader configuration the file extensions are specified. Why Firefox decides to show mime types out of the sudden?\nAlso uploader setting is called mime_types but file extensions are specified instead of mime types. Confusing.\n. Then we'll wait until Firefox developers discover the issue and fix it. Thanks for you help in identifying a problem.\n. Maybe small size is due resize : {width : 320, height : 240, quality : 90}, option and file indeed is resized before/after being uploaded. But nevertheless the initial file size calculation needs to be fixed.\n. After doing some more tests I've discovered following:\n- if a file size is smaller than chunk size (e.g. 38KB file and 1mb chunk), then file size is displayed properly\n- if a chunk size is 1mb and file is 1.2mb or 11.1mb, then size is rounded\nSo I guess the problem is in size rounding. I think it's not correct to remove decimal part of file size alltogether.\n. I don't see any explicit if statements in https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/blob/master/src/javascript/file/FileDrop.js that might prevent IE10 from working.\n. In IE 11 the HTML5 runtime doesn't work. Tested on http://www.plupload.com/example_all_runtimes.php page.\n. Now I discovered, that even though website http://www.plupload.com/ says v2.0.0 everywhere, but the demes are still using 1.5.x release.\n. It appears, that the plupload.zip, that can be downloaded as official 2.0.0 release in fact contains beta versions of code.\nI've then manually downloaded plupload.full.min.js and Moxie.swf from GitHub and all works fine in IE 11.\n. But it gives an error in IE 10.\n. I don't have it, but collegue have it on his PC. IE9 complains, that name is undefined in some small file on 54 line, which seems to be some kind of bridge between JavaScript and Flash.\nFor me IE10 upload completes, but drag-n-drop doesn't work (IE10 on Windows 7 in VMWare). Colleague in IE10 on Windows 8 can select file directly (not via drag-n-drop), but upload doesn't work and is stuck on 1/3%.\nIt appears, that in IE9 (and below) a flash runtime is used and that gives an error.\n. I've tested using VMWare images of Windows 7 with IE9 and IE10, that I've downloaded here: http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads\n- Win7_IE9 - no drag-n-drop (but I guess IE9 doesn't support it), both Flash & HTML4 runtime work with no errors\n- Win7_IE10 - no drag-n-drop (I think IE10 supports drag-n-drop), HTML5 runtime works with no errors\n- Win7_IE11 - drag-n-drop works, HTML runtime works with no errors\nBy \"no drag-n-drop\" I mean, that when I drop a file onto dropzone it replaces whole page, as it was in HTML4.\nBut it is very strange, that what works on Windows within VMWare might not work on real Windows.\nAlso I've noticed odd, but not critical thing: HTML5 runtime in IE11 files much more UploadProgress events, then IE10 for example. File is uploader nevertheless.\n. Error in IE9 on my collegue PR is in __flash__addcallback function and says Unspecified error.\nI belive this is related to https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/530#issuecomment-18678505\n. Digging more about that problem revealed following websites:\nhttp://labs.hellokeita.com/2007/10/16/swfobject-externalinterface-bug-on-ie/:\n- creating functions with names, that are reserved by Flash causes a problem (e.g. play, stop, tags, item, length, etc.)\n- using flash object before it is initialized cases a problem\n- calling flash object methods, that was destroyed\n- <embedded tag without ID attribute might cause problems\n- if swf file is cached by browser, then it might not work\n. I've used non-minified versions of Moxie and Plupload to figure out what code raises an error. Error happens in https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/blob/master/src/javascript/runtime/flash/Runtime.js#L160 line, when shimExec method is called with following arguments ('FileInput', 'init', ....).\nHere my full HTML. Maybe options I'm passing (which comes from demo page) causing Flash to fail. Besides Flash version in the browser is 11.9, so check for flash version being >11.3 passes.\n``` html\nCustom example\nShows you how to use the core plupload API.\nYour browser doesn't have Flash or HTML5 support.\n\nToggle Overlay\n\n\n BEGIN: Dropzone + Browse Button. \n\n If the HTML5 runtime engine is enabled, show this. \n\n            Drag & Drop Your Files Here!\n        \n If the Flash runtime engine is enabled, show this. \n\n            Click Here To Select Files!\n        \n\n END: Dropzone + Browse Button. \n[Select files]\n[Upload files]\n\n\n\n\n    // Custom example logic\n\n    var uploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n        runtimes : 'html5,flash,html4',\n        drop_element: \"pluploadDropzone\",\n        browse_button : 'pluploadDropzone',\n//      browse_button : 'pickfiles', // you can pass in id...\n        container: document.getElementById('container'), // ... or DOM Element itself\n        url : 'modules/custom/upload.php',\n        flash_swf_url : 'js/plupload/Moxie.swf',\n\n        filters : {\n            max_file_size : '15mb',\n            mime_types: [\n                {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"},\n                {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip\"}\n            ]\n        },\n\n        init: {\n            PostInit: function() {\n                document.getElementById('filelist').innerHTML = '';\n\n                document.getElementById('uploadfiles').onclick = function() {\n                    uploader.start();\n                    return false;\n                };\n            },\n\n            FilesAdded: function(up, files) {\n                alert('event: FilesAdded');\n                plupload.each(files, function(file) {\n//                  console.log('FilesAdded', file);\n                    document.getElementById('filelist').innerHTML += '<div id=\"' + file.id + '\">' + file.name + ' (' + plupload.formatSize(file.size) + ') <b></b></div>';\n                });\n            },\n\n            UploadProgress: function(up, file) {\n                alert('event: UploadProgress');\n//              console.log('UploadProgress', file);\n                document.getElementById(file.id).getElementsByTagName('b')[0].innerHTML = '<span>' + file.percent + \"%</span>\";\n            },\n            FileUploaded: function (up, file, response) {\n                alert('event: FileUploaded');\n//              console.log('FileUploaded;', up, file, response);\n\n                var realResponse = eval('(' + response.response + ')');\n\n                $('#' + file.id).html('<a href=\"' + realResponse.fileUrl + '\" class=\"page-reload\">' + file.name + '</a> (' + plupload.formatSize(file.size) + ') - uploaded');\n            },\n            Error: function(up, err) {\n                document.getElementById('console').innerHTML += \"\\nError #\" + err.code + \": \" + err.message;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    uploader.init();\n\n``\n.

Same error in Firefox: http://screencast.com/t/h5ieTG1bf\n. Besides I see flash being present in DOM (small box in top left corner of the container). I guess theFileUpload.init` would expand it to hover over actual \"browse files\" button, but due the error this never happens.\n. Flash runtime might be working just fine, when I'm in HTML4 document. All the problems seem to come from HTML5 doctype + flash.\n. I've tried http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/ in IE10 on Windows 7 and I wasn't able to use drag-n-drop. Is there a proof, that drag-n-drop upload in IE10 worked at all?\nAccording to http://caniuse.com/#feat=dragndrop the IE10 support HTML5 drag-n-drop, but not sure if it works for files as well.\n. @jayarjo , ping.\n. In total I have these problems:\n1. inability to upload file with Flash runtime, when HTML5 doctype is being used (in all browsers)\n2. non working drag-n-drop (in IE10)\n3. upload progress bar stuck on HTML5 runtime in IE10 (on some machines) on 3% of upload progress bar\nSince I wasn't able to upload a file at 100%, then we can consider this a file corruption :)\n. About file corruption: maybe you have a problem in upload.php file that handles saving file on disk and doesn't properly concatenate uploaded chunks.\n. > @aik099 drag and drop issue in Win8 + IE10 doesn't seem to occur: http://jsfiddle.net/a6awH/.\n@jayarjo, great, what about Windows 7?\nAlso what about that Flash runtime problem that's not working in all browsers?\n. > @aik099 the same for Windows 7... Maybe you are dragging it to a wrong element (for some reason your Select Files button is not functional)?\nI figured out where is the catch. I've set drop_element and browse_button to the same element. This way if a browser doesn't support drag-n-drop, then user can click on drop area to perform an upload. I guess this isn't handled properly.\n. > Also what about that Flash runtime problem that's not working in all browsers?\nThe big file are going to be uploaded on the website, where I'm using Plupload. I don't want the IE9 and below users to be suffering from HTML4 runtime inability to show upload progress or do chunked uploads.\n. > I'm downloading IE9 VM now, do not have it here.\nAs I've discovered over time the Flash runtime problem isn't IE specific. You can see from screenshots that error in happening in all browsers. Just set runtimes to flash,html4 to see it.\n. > The error like this gets triggered when Flash component gets disabled, due to one reason or another. If its display rule is set to 'none' for example, or of its container.\nThat helped a lot. Actually I have div content that was reloaded via AJAX request. And as a part of that AJAX returned HTML was a Plupload instance. When a content of a DIV was replaced by AJAX request, then flash object wasn't properly disposed and on next page load it cause this error. Now I'm doing plupload.destroy() call to clean up things before doing new AJAX requests and all is working fine in IE10/IE9. Thanks.\nI've reported #966 for that browse_button/drop_element element combination problem.\n. It would really help if an issues can be reviewed at least same week and not after a month or more.\n. I've found the solution, but I'm not sure if it's right one.\njs\n$uploader_options.init['FilesRemoved'] = function(uploader, files) {\n    $.each(files, function (index, file) {\n        if ( file.status != plupload.QUEUED ) {\n            uploader.stop();\n            uploader.start();\n        }\n    });\n};\nBasically I'm listing for all removed files and if it happens, that removed file was being currently uploaded I restart upload procedure.\n. Have you addressed this issue specifically? Can you point me to commit with a fix?\nI of course can blindly replace js/swf files and hope, that it will work, but it's better to know exact commit/task with a fix.\n. > Also doing uploader.stop() doesn't stop current uploading file, but that behavior is documented.\nhttp://www.plupload.com/plupload/docs/api/index.html#class_plupload.Uploader.html-stop - stops the upload of queued files. I understand it as: if one files from a queue (first one) is uploading right now, then it will continue to upload till 100% in my case and others won't start to upload after that.\nAnyway with chunked uploads if you stop upload in the middle, then some chunks are saved on server anyway :)\n\nWhat you mean it is documented, where? Plupload 2.x should stop upload immediately.\n\nI can't find that place right now, but it seems (maybe these are faulty 1.5.x docs, listed on website) that some runtimes have problems with interrupting upload in the middle and you still need to wait for it to complete.\n. ping\n. I've noticed that used shim (which handles drag & drop) does trigger dragover and dragleave events, but their are not exposed on the plupload configuration.\n. I've tried that but stumbled upon a problem, that I have a browse button within a dropzone div. Then when mouse with a file moves over a button (within dropzone) that dragleave event is fired and the dragenter is not fired when mouse moves back to dropzone.\n. Seems like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10867506/dragleave-of-parent-element-fires-when-dragging-over-children-elements . I guess we can close this issue now, since Plupload doesn't provide any default highlight for dropzone.\nBut that would be cool indeed to have \"hovered\" (or any class given in settings) to be set on dropzone element automatically. But the Plupload need to take care of these child element dragleave event problem as well.\n. This sounds like duplicate of #1179.\n. When I choose duplicates I pick as original issue the one, that has more info on a subject, not the one, that was created earlier.\n. > Maybe we all should use some strange methods for duplication? If something is duplicating other - that means the other is newer than the original one. So maybe stick to the definitions and not make your own? - just not random thought.\nI do, what I think best for a project. I think, that duplicates, that provide less intel should be closed to prevent too much noise in issue list. This way the issue, that stays (regardless of creation date) has most valuable intel to reproduce the problem or has some valuable fixing solution.\nJumping between issue and it's duplicates to figure out all needed info doesn't seem a productive approach to me, but I guess you like it better :wink: \n\nAlso this issue is still available on newer version of the library than i had reported - so no one even tried to fix that. (PS: I contacted moxie by mail - but got ignored totally).\n\nI'm aware of that, which is explained in my latest comment: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1179#issuecomment-97377585\n. Way of handling the accept attribute still differs grately between different browsers. I won't be putting much hopes on it.\nTheoretically Plupload/Moxie shouldn't care about length of extension, but maybe they do and that creates a bug.\nMaybe this commit is related: c7ef0c65ec03c526809e85796e0ef67290bdb7b9\n. Yes, since the accept attribute is all about Mime types, then file extensions are no good there unless Plupload can't map them out. For me the woff file (this font file) was recognized as zip file because it's compressed xml of some sort.\n. > Yep, I'm afraid there's no other way around.\nYou mean, that using file filters is recommended approach?. I'm having this problem with Plupload v2.1.2 + mOxie v1.2.1. The https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/js/plupload.dev.js#L1408 line is causing this. Looking at the code the xhr global variable is still used.\nHow to reproduce:\n1. create uploader that accepts only mp3 files + 200 queue limit\n2. select 20 files where some are mp3 and some are mid\n3. see, that after file that failed file extension validation all other files failed to upload due xhr is null error.\nIn fact on website, where I'm using Plupload I might as well immediately remove failed files from queue as @shufenghua did. \n. The https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/js/plupload.dev.js#L892 suggests, that the xhr variable is still per-uploader global not per-file global.\n. 1. Maybe it should be just var e = this.getSource(); instead? Try sending PR for that.\n2. What are you doing exactly to get this error?\n. Is this error browser/OS-specific? Works on some OS/browser and doesn't on others.\nMaybe this has something to do with your Plupload custom config. Also does it work on demo (http://www.plupload.com/examples/core)?\n. Ah, you're sending an JS object and jQuery failed to transform it into string properly. You can try reporting this to jQuery instead. If you do please post that issue link in here as well.\n. Maybe it is a browser bug? Does filtering work if you just create HTML5  with mime types specified?\n. You can render elements in queue yourself and when file is added to the queue you provide complete HTML, including upload progress bar, yourself.\nIf you're using queue plugin, then I guess you can't add your event after that event is fired.\n. Since you're obviously (based on screenshot) using queue plugin, then I recommend looking at what events it uses to render UI. Then you can either extend that plugin (I don't know if it's possible) or just copy-paste and add your code where you need it.\nWhat I think is happening is that plugin is either using different events or your event handler is executed before plugin one does and therefore yours have no effect because plugin replaces HTML completely. \n. What you mean? You want to get SHA1 of uploaded file before or after upload is happened? What's your usecase?\n. So you want to prevent user from uploading file if it was already uploaded. I guess you can use HTML5 FileApi to do that stuff manually and then send an AJAX request to server to confirm that file exists.\n. I suppose 2nd image is JPG. Maybe 1st image is animated GIF? It's possible, that thumbnails for GIF images are not supported.\n. 1. Have you compared original image (that you're uploading) VS one that were saved on web server by plupload (e.g. size match, content match)?\n2. What if you repeat upload image again you get same problem?\n3. Does uploading image on the demo site of Plupload work?\n. > (3)No, I have upload it my application\nThis means, that you're able to upload that CMYK file on Plupload demo website and all was fine. But you're not able to do so on your website.\nThis means, that an equivalent of upload.php file from demo website that is getting your file from browser (even when doing chunked upload) isn't assembling them back right or doing some kind of transformation (e.g. resizing) along the way, that breaks it.\nThese should be no size/content change for file saved on web server vs file you're selected for upload on your computer.\n. From what I understand there is something in your Plupload configuration that results in an error. Could you please post JS code used to initialize Plupload.\n. What is UAParser.browser and how come it had .major property before but no more? Could you please send a PR with a fix?\n. It's pretty easy in fact for such small change. You just do this:\n1. open a file on GitHub\n2. click on pencil icon in top right corner to edit (it will say, that you're not repo owner and it will be forked to you)\n3. now you see file in editor\n4. make necessary change\n5. click save or send PR button somewhere on the page\nBut keep in mind, that Plupload/Moxie is developed using modular approach and plupload.js and moxie.js is generated file from other smaller files. So you need to change that smaller file and I have no idea what does generation.\n. If Silverlight doesn't have permission to get file date, then what value you expect to have in the lastModifiedDate property. Maybe null?\n. I'm not Silverlight user myself, because I'm on Linux and using regular HTML5 file upload. But from you've described I imagine several cases:\n1. The Silverlight can ask user permission and user can deny the request resulting in wrong last modified date\n2. The Silverlight can ask user permission and user can approve the request resulting in correct last modified date\n3. The Silverlight might not ask user permission at all resulting in wrong last modified date\nIf you can, then please send a PR with a fix.\n. You mean, that you have page, that has iframe on it and the page, that loads in iframe has <script> tag to load plupload? Then it doesn't work?\n. ",

    "MCF": "You don't have to hack plupload to do this (although there is nothing wrong with that approach if you are happy with it).  You can bind a FilesAdded event handler before you call your uploader's init() function.  Sort the 'files' array inside your FilesAdded event handing function - the files array will be passed into that function.\nThis technique works because event handlers are called in the order they are registered.  This includes all of plupload's event handlers - they are bound in the init() call.  So binding a FilesAdded handler to sort the files array before calling init() means you can rearrange the 'files' array before the plupload routines get their hands on it and start the upload.\n. Cappuccino is the specific library that forced me to look into this.  Cappuccino overrides the system setTimeout function, its alias behaves the same way but it is expecting the delay argument.  It would not be easy to put together a simple example showing the effects but I can assure you it causes all sorts of strange behaviours with animations in Cappuccino (it took me a long, long time to track down the specific cause of the erratic behaviour caused by the missing delay argument).  If not having a simple example is a deal breaker I could write one up but it will take a few days to cobble something together.\nWhy are you reluctant to change this?  There are a 5 or 6 other calls to window.setTimeout in the plupload code base and they all specify a delay in milliseconds.  Most use 1 millisecond for the delay and I believe in one case 0 was used - 1 also seems to be the Jquery convention - for these reasons I used 1 in the patch.  I'm failing to see any benefit to not specifying a required argument to setTimeout and, with Cappuccino as an example, it does cause esoteric problems with other libraries.\n. I've seen this behavior as well.  I can't comment on the debugging specifics noted above as I haven't been able to look into it in too much detail.  But this bug does not happen with all applications - which is why it probably hasn't been fixed.\nI have a very simple test case which works fine with html4.  When I run essentially the same plupload code in a more complicated application the response opens in a new window as noted above.\n. I don't have a strong need to fix this at the moment.  I specify the Flash runtime before html4 and count on that solving the problem for my users on IE.\nThe application where I see the problem is unfortunately too big to debug in IE - IE8's debugging tools are not advanced enough to let me sort out what the problem is.  I spent a few hours trying to track it down, discovered a few other errors in the html4 runtime, and gave up in frustration.  It would be nice to have a reliable html4 runtime for IE, but I'm not counting on it at the moment - and I don't have the time, or need, to look into it further right now.\n. I've run the latest html4 from master with the same app.  In IE8 when clicking on the browse_button, selecting a file and clicking O.K. I get a script error at line 149 - plupload.removeAllEvents(form, up.id) shown below:\n```\n// add change event\nplupload.addEvent(input, 'change', function(e) {\n    var element = e.target, name, files = [], topElement;\nif (element.value) {\n    getById('form_' + currentFileId).style.top = -0xFFFFF + \"px\";\n\n    // Get file name\n    name = element.value.replace(/\\\\/g, '/');\n    name = name.substring(name.length, name.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);\n\n    // Push files\n    files.push(new plupload.File(currentFileId, name));\n\n    // Clean-up events - they won't be needed anymore\n    if (!up.features.canOpenDialog) {\n        plupload.removeAllEvents(form, up.id);   // IE8 breaks here!\n    } else {\n        plupload.removeEvent(browseButton, 'click', up.id);\n    }\n    plupload.removeEvent(input, 'change', up.id);\n\n    // Create and position next form\n    createForm();\n\n    // Fire FilesAdded event\n    if (files.length) {\n        uploader.trigger(\"FilesAdded\", files);\n    }               \n}\n\n}, up.id);    \n```\nThe error thrown is \"Object doesn't support this property or method\".  When I tell the debugger to continue it throws the same error for each line that contains removeAllEvents.  I tell the debugger to continue each time until it throws a different error at line 352, in a FilesRemoved callback, the n.parentNode.removeChild(n) line shown below:\nfor (i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {\n    n = getById('form_' + files[i].id);\n    n.parentNode.removeChild(n);\n}\nThe error thrown is \"Object required\".\nThe good news is that after telling the debugger to continue 6 times the file is uploaded and the response comes back to plupload in the current window as expected.  The response is not returned in a new browser window.\nMost of the errors described above also occur with a very simple test case (very similar to the custom example).  So I don't think this is the same kind of problem as the original issue.  I guess the recent html4 changes haven't been tested in IE.\n. O.K. I realized I'd made a mistake when copying over the new plupload.js.  I retried with both the latest version of plupload.js and plupload.html4.js.  The first set of errors I mentioned above (removeEvent) go away.  But the removeChild error still remains.\n. I'm not doing anything unusual with plupload.  Just calling it more or less like the custom.html example is setup (albeit integrated with a lot of other code).\n. I asked about this same problem on the discussion forum a few months ago as well, so I can confirm the problems exists:\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=337\n. Related?\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/314\n. I think the multiple file problem in Safari 5.1 on Windows is due to a bug in the latest Safari and is not related to the problems discussed in this issue.  The current stable release of Safari on Windows is a newer build (AFAIK) of the current stable OS X Safari.  I think that is why the bug is only showing up on Windows.\nI've been looking into this and will create a new issue in the next day or two.  Unfortunately I cannot find a workaround for the issue so far but will have more details in the new issue.\n. Sorry, I forgot about logging the bug against plupload.  The new issue is here:\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/363\n. This issue is related to, or a duplicate of:\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/346\n. Duplicate of 223?  Or at the least related...\n. Related?\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/305\n. I've found that flash does not work properly on IE9.  The custom example stripped down to only import plupload.js, plupload.flash.js - and only use the flash runtime - will not work at all in IE9.  The \"no runtime found\" is displayed and never changes to show flash.\nHowever if the Document mode for the page is changed manually to use IE8 or IE7 the custom example will again work as expected.  The flash runtime is found, file selection works, and upload works.  So a very quick and dirty workaround would be to set your page to use IE8 Document mode by adding this tag:\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=EmulateIE8\" />\nto your upload page immediately after the <head> tag.  I've tested it and the custom example will work again in IE9 with that tag added.\n. IMHO this is still a bug and should probably be left open?\n. I'm guessing this issue is related to:\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/323\n. I have no other flash objects on the page.  In my testing I just used the custom example stripped down to only use the flash runtime, and only include the core plupload and flash javascript files.\nI was running:\nWindows Vista (32-bit)\nIE 9.0.8.x\nFlash Player 10.3.x\n. I have tested the latest plupload on Firefox 3.6.20 (on Ubuntu Linux) and have not seen this problem.  But then I'd imagine our configurations are quite different.  I'm uploading JPEGs to a Rails server using the html5 runtime and the core plupload only (in other words no queue or ui widgets).  My config is as follows:\n\npluploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n  runtimes : 'html5,flash,html4',\n  browse_button : 'selectFiles_id',\n  container : 'selectFiles_id',\n  max_file_size : '10mb',\n  url : aURL,\n  resize : {width : 1500, height : 1500, quality : 92},\n  flash_swf_url : '/plugins/plupload.flash.swf',\n  multipart: true,\n  urlstream_upload: true\n});\n\n. @gabor I ran a quick test with your two versions on Firefox 3.6.20 and the uploaded file sizes were correct for both versions of your test.  I tried with a single file and multiple files - both worked fine for me.  I also cleared the cache between the tests to be sure I had the appropriate plupload components for each test.\n. Sorry I don't have 3.6 installed on Windows.  Are you using the exact same version of Firefox (3.6.20)?\n. Yes I'm quite certain I'm using 3.6.20.  I'm not suggesting that you are not seeing a problem with that browser and your configuration/use of plupload BTW.  plupload tends to be pretty finicky, with many configurations available, different behaviours with different browsers and with different file types, etc.\nI was uploading text files to your server with your two test cases above.  Depending on your configuration plupload may be doing different things with text files instead of images for example.  What are you trying to upload with your tests?  What is your configuration?  Are you sure your server side processing is doing the right thing with the POST from plupload?\n. I've tried uploading your sample image to your \"bad\" test app through both Firefox 3.6.20 and Chrome 12.  I get the following error displayed in both:\nError: -600, Message: File size error., File: duck_test.jpg\nWhen I tried with my own test image I get different results.  In Firefox 3.6.20:\n2.jpg (688 KB) 87%\nError: -200, Message: HTTP Error., File: 2.jpg\nIn Chrome 12 my 2.jpg test image uploaded succesfully.\nBoth images upload fine in my own test app, using the latest code from the master branch.  However as I mentioned above I use a different configuration as you do, so plupload will (more than likely) be following a different code path to perform the upload.\n. The latest round of changes seems to have fixed this issue.\nAs a general comment about the often convoluted code surrounding browser compatibility I would strongly suggest that clear comments regarding the purposes of the various conditionals be included.  It is very difficult to work on the code without knowing the history and rational for the often confusing conditionals and feature detections.  Comments describing why something is being done would make it a lot easier.\n. I haven't seen the problem you are describing with Safari 5.1 (6534.50).  Testing on that browser with plupload (from a few weeks ago at least) and the reduced test case I mention above works fine.  I was only seeing this issue with the newer build on Windows - Safari 5.1 (7534.50).\n. You could try the reduced test cased I mention above.  If it doesn't happen with that then it must be something specific to plupload and your configuration of plupload.\nAlso try out your plupload app with other browsers I guess and look for the same misbehaviour.\n. Sorry, I hate github's \"Comment & Close\" button.  I keep hitting it accidentally when adding comments to a bug.  This bug is still open.  And I can't find a workaround for this either - so it renders html5 useless on Safari.  The only choice seems to be to use another runtime entirely.\n. Do you really think this issue should be closed?  I would think it would be better to leave it open until Apple fixes Safari on Windows and you can re-enable multiple file upload for that browser.  The HTML5 runtime is not terribly useful for most users without the ability to select and upload multiple files at once - effectively killing it's use for most people on Safari for Windows.\n. No but the word on the street is that Apple tracks the number of bug reports for each issue and that helps them decide which to fix first.  Feel free to re-report the issue if you'd like:\nFree registration for the developer program:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/programs/register/\nReport an issue:\nhttp://bugreport.apple.com\n. The underlying Safari bug is still present with the latest release of Safari for Windows (5.1.1 - 7534.51.22).\n. I've confirmed that the ie9_flash branch has fixed seemingly the same problem with IE9 and flash for me.  More details here:\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=4953#p4953\n. Safari for Windows has a bug that prevents multi-file upload using html5:\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/363\n. I agree that it's going to be complicated, and certainly understand that this is pretty tricky.  But we don't do ourselves any favours by not being clear in the logic and/or providing detailed comments.  For example the code above includes two tests that use the features.jpegresize property - once, not surprisingly, as part of a larger test to determine if a resize should be attempted - and once for...  I don't know what - something to do with loading the file into memory.  That seems a bit odd and certainly not entirely clear.\n. I guess ultimately my last comment is a good argument for your suggested solution: browser sniffing.  This stuff is so very frustrating.\nBTW I assume that using readFileAsBinary instead of a straight call to sendBinaryBlob on line 737 is not the best solution because it will then load the whole file into memory?  Not good for people uploading large files?  If this is true switching to readFileAsBinary on line 737 would be a reasonable work around for those using pluplaod that do not need to worry about large file uploads.\n. Be that as it may, for non-chunked uploads leaving the check in introduces a race condition when stopping uploads and clearing the queue (i.e. Canceling an upload).  Perhaps the conditional should be changed to only check if the upload state is stopped if you are also using chunking?\n. I can't answer this question as I'm still using the older version.\n. I also have this problem.  I tried uploading 150, then 75, then 38 images and in all cases it hung after 2 or 3 images were uploaded. With 18 images selected for upload it made it to 10 images before hanging.  This was on IE9 with the latest flash version.  My plupload config is as follows:\npluploader = new plupload.Uploader({\n        runtimes : 'html5,flash,html4',\n        browse_button : 'selectFiles_id',\n        container : 'selectFiles_id',\n        max_file_size : '10mb',\n        url : aURL,\n        resize : {width : 1500, height : 1500, quality : 92},\n        flash_swf_url : '/plugins/plupload.flash.swf',\n        multipart: true,\n        urlstream_upload: true\n    });\nThe backend is rails which works without fail when the html5 runtime is used for any number of images.\nWhen I turned resizing off the 150 images upload made it to 26 and 21 images before hanging in two different tests.\n. The versions I am using in my tests are:\nIE 9.0.8112.16421\nFlash 11.0.1.152\nplupload 1.5.1.1\n. I upgraded flash to the newest version available (11.1.102.55) and reran the tests with the following results:\nWith resize on\n150 - hung after 57 uploads\n150 - hung after 10 uploads\n75 - hung after 2 uploads\n38 - hung after 14 uploads\n18 - hung after 4 uploads\n9 - success\nWith resize off\n150 - hung after 9 uploads\n75 - hung after 2 uploads\nThe memory and CPU use profiles looked reasonable throughout all tests.  Although the CPU usage for the unresized uploads looked identical to when the images where being resized before upload.\n. Probably related to, or a duplicate of, #421\n. You will probably have better luck asking these types of questions on the plupload forum:\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/index.php\nOr you may also be able to find answers to your questions by searching past forum posts.\n. Probably related to, or a duplicate of, #411\n. Any possibility of providing a .swf file that includes your fix?  Then others could test as well without having to build it.\n. @jayarvo - I've tested your swf file with a 150 upload and a 257 upload, using Flash version 11.1.102.55 (the non-dev version), they both worked fine.  In both cases images were being resized then uploaded.\nYou seem to have fixed the problem, thanks.\n. Your problem does not seem to be a bug in plupload.   If Denozawr's suggestion does not work for you then try the plupload forum for answers to this kind of question:\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/index.php\n. This has been discussed on the forum as well:\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=1367\nIt seems that some portrait images are not being resized by the flash runtime.\nI've tested the image noted above, resizing with {width : 1280, height : 1280, quality : 90} and had the same result with the flash runtime.  The image is not resized.  I also tested resizing to 1280x120 with several other landscape and portrait images and found other images that were not resized when uploaded with the flash runtime (they were all portrait images).  Here are some examples:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2LMal.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nh8cM.jpg\nThe files are being changed on upload as the uploaded image has a larger file size.  But the dimensions of the uploaded image is the same as the original.\nSome people have reported problems only when the max dimensions are set to around 1000.  I've tested the following resizing:\n900x900 - works fine\n1000x1000 - sometimes it works, sometimes not.\n1280x1280 - does not resize\n. I have just finished running the same tests with the plupload.flash.swf hotfix for issue #421 - and the problem is no longer observed.  Perhaps the portrait image problem is simply another symptom of the underlying flash bug that was causing the random hangs noted in issue #421.\n. Hotfix noted in #421 is available here:\nhttps://github.com/downloads/moxiecode/plupload/plupload.flash.swf\n. You mean you can't download the .swf?  The link still works fine for me.\n.

But after I add multipart:false, all 3 browsers can upload successfully.\n. Thank you, @jayarjo. I will try your recommended solution for Flash. \nBtw, the reason I prefer Flash runtime than html5 runtime is because \"html5 has no progress info\".

Hi Jayarjo,\nI'd like to jump in here and say that I do believe you're thinking of Plupload\ntoo much as a client-side only application.\nPlease see my issue regarding the lack of server implementation\ndocumentation. Plupload is using several platforms, all with their own\nuploading mechanics. Adding another is not a problem, in fact a great\nfeature, but you do need to create such documentation page describing all\nthe server-side implementations that are required.\nThis will allow you to work with any platform. If any server side implementations are expected to be too sophisticated for \"newbies\", simply default that runtime environment to be prioritized lower than html. In other words, they will never have to deal with it unless they specifically enable it.\nDevelopers like me, who implement their own servers (personally I work with node.js), are very much in need of such details. I also welcome a Java runtime, that'd be great.\nAlso note that your PHP example is very specific to PHP, no description is\ngiven on how you differentiate between binary streams, multipart and/or with\nchunking.\nThanks for all the hard work.\nRegards,\nTom\n2011/4/18 jayarjo \nreply@reply.github.com\n\nHi Jakob,\nIt's just that server-side is getting more complex, than average user can\nhandle by himself. We were including upload.php into the bundle as example\nso far. If we merge in your great Java runtime we will have to rework\nupload.php and obviously bundle it as a part of Plupload, and not just mere\nexample. But from such perspective, Plupload, as client-server solution has\nsome major inconsistencies, mostly because of our perception of it as a\nclient-side only. While we also think that we need to push it further, for\nexample chunking, but it obviously will require major revision.\nWhat you think?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/pull/170#issuecomment-1020982\n. I'm not sure, but why would your server be dependent on the chunk size of the client? You should handle your incoming data as it streams in.\n. I have been having problems uploading after a upload has finished too. Is this a bug?\n. @drumaddict, try this:\n\n//resets the upload status of each file\nvar resetUploadStatus = function() {\n    for (var i = 0; i < uploader.files.length; i++) {\n        uploader.files[i].status = 1;\n    }\n};\n. this really needs to get some attention in an official release\n. It would be nice to get access to local files in any way whenever the runtime allows for this feature.\n. @jayarjo, for example, if the runtime allows local access to the selected files (eg. flash 10), then javascript should bridge to the binary data of these files. This allows one to for example play an audio file that has been added to the queue or check the contents of a zip file (assuming that one knows how to inspect such data).\n. Note that the queue order set by the interface widget is merely changing the visual order of the queue, but not actually changing the order at which files are uploaded to the server! I am suggesting the latter one.\n. Has any thought gone into this?\n. +1 for compression\n. To my surprise this is all the stop method seems to do:\nstop : function() {\n            if (this.state != plupload.STOPPED) {\n                this.state = plupload.STOPPED;                  \n                this.trigger(\"StateChanged\");\n            }\n        },\nSo, I figured the actionscript code would listen to this StateChanged event so that it would stop the ongoing upload process, but I cannot see such behavior anywhere: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/src/flash/plupload/src/com/plupload/Plupload.as\nHas this stop method even been implemented fully or am I missing something? It appears to have no effect.\n. @DandyDev: correct. It seems like these kind of issues are not being resolved or looked into either.\nI'm looking for a different library, not with much success though.\n. @DandyDev, your colleague has a talent for putting things rightly. I'm afraid we're in the same boat.\nIt might be an idea for companies like the one you work for to collaterally invest in these kind of open source projects, which have a lot of potential, but lack manpower and commitment.\n. After debugging it seems that xml.sendAsBinary is being executed almost instantly, yet the request is received at the server a long time after (like 4 seconds). What could possibly cause this?\n. I will have to try it out as soon as I can. Will report back my findings. Thanks.\n. Also described in https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/299\nSadly, it's not getting much attention.\nMy advice would be for your company to look into contributing to the project, as it's development seems to have stalled quite a bit.\n. @afterdesign, please make a pull request :)\n. I would just test it yourself and make the pull request when you're ready.\nIt probably will take a while before it gets accepted anyway. :)\n. Any chance this will get fixed?\nAlso, is this issue apparent in other runtimes too, such as html5?\n. Great, thanks. Hope the pull gets accepted.\n. It just worked better this way. I see you tried to address the issue in another commit though, I will test it out as soon as possible and come back with my findings.\nThank you very much.\n. ",
    "jakobadam": "Hi Davit,\nCould you elaborate on why you think it requires a mayor revise? \nObviously you need to revise the php backend a bit, but this is not much.\nIn terms of the front-end you just need the jar and the extra js file for the runtime. But this is already done.\nDo I miss something? I'll be happy to help at my end.\nkind regards,\nJakob\n. hi again,\nI see the complexity of the project rising if you begin to include all the different backends. However, we all like stuff that just works without any hassle.\nMaybe you could think of some structure with sub-projects for the different backends. At our end, we now use both Python and Java backends. \n-- Jakob\n. Regarding the discussion about the backend. \nI'm now getting emails from people, that don't now how to deploy the stuff on a server. Obviously, because you really need to now the ins and outs of many things to do that.\nI have created a new project, with everything included for easy deployment of the python backend on an Apache server.\nhttps://github.com/jakobadam/plupload-deploy\nFeedback is welcome.\n. I factored out all the java runtime relevant code and created two new projects:\n- Plupload Java Runtime: https://github.com/jakobadam/plupload-java-runtime\n- Plupload Python Backend: https://github.com/jakobadam/plupload-python-backend\nClosing this stale pull request.\n. Unfortunately, I don't know flash.\nAnyways, somewhere there should be a warning that when chunking is enabled the file is loaded into memory.\n. Wasn't clear to me... I'm very surprised that it is not possible to get the progress of the file upload without loading everything into memory.\n. If you don't use chunking the flash runtime doesn't load the file into memory.\nThe problem is that FileReference::upload only has a completed event. The flash runtime fakes this by loading everything into memory and splits it up.\n. I was investigating - in connection with http://www.cabo.dk/blog/jakobs-blog/survey-of-large-browser-uploads - when flash uploads overflows and did some large uploads on my local machine. It doesn't eat up the memory.\n. Ah thanks for the pointer. I can see I need to pull in some changes. \n. ",

    "JocelynDelalande": "Ok it's just an example, but it's a non-working example. Considering that the documentation is far from being perfect, working examples are important :-).\nRegarding the custom validation itself, I saw that there are events, placed at useful places, but do they allow that, for example on upload start event : \n- catch BeforeUpload event ;\n- prevent the upload to occur if some custom validation checks doesn't pass.\nI don't have the impression that it's possible, but maybe I'm wrong.\nI agree with you, it remains possible to do validation binding a \"start\" button to custom code doing validation first and starting upload then if relevant.\nMy point is that I don't see any easy way to do that with the jquery widget without modifying it (unbinding the start button click event and binding it to some custom code).\n. My use case is rather common I think :\nI offer the user the choice of the folder to upload to. If no folder has been selected, I don't want the upload to start. \nIt's not a problem for me, I did the unbind/bind trick and voil\u00e0. But if I got the philosophy of the jquery widget, it's to make things simple & quick. Providing a hook to do validation may be part of this goal. \nI hope this report may help :)\n.

Mostly through experimentation; I didn't see any obvious reason for this behaviour in the Chrome source code, so it may be an artifact of the platform-specific image rendering library used by Chrome.\nAs far as I know, Chrome is the only major released browser that supports the \"quality\" option to canvas.toDataURL() (Firefox throws a Security Exception, for which there is an open bug). This specific invocation of canvas.toDataURL() with a quality setting  in Chrome is the only instance I've observed across any browser where the resulting data still contains any JPEG headers.\nThe HTML5 canvas spec is rather vague about this, only stating that color correction data should be stripped and that a future version may allow finer control over image metadata, so this behaviour seems to be rather implementation-specific.\nThe change here should effectively be a no-op on any browser that does not retain JPEG header data across the resize operation.\n. That's interesting, I hadn't actually noticed, but you're right, Preview at least does show the Exif data from the extra block.\nSpecifically, the program causing me trouble is the standard ImageMagick (http://imagemagick.org) image-processing library, which does not recognize the additional EXIF data.

Even though I set z-index to 0 or 1 on the \"select files\" button that I create the form plupload creates still doesn't get selected.\nIf I add (in Firebug) z-index: 99999; (for example) to the  tag that plupload creates when using the html4 runtime then the \"select files\" button works perfectly in Firefox.

So when the user press \"Add files\", input.click is not fired and there is no input=file underneath it as a workaround.\nThis is easily resolved by calling refresh() on the modal dialog \"open\" event.\n3 - The third issue is with the input=file z-index being lower than the modal overlay.\nBecause of that, regardless whether input=file is triggered through onClick event or through a physical mouse-click, \nthe browse dialog will not show up.\nUpon creation of the input=file element, the code puts it one index lower than the browseButton.\nThe issue here is that browseButton has a z-index of 0 (rather, its not defined).\nThis puts the input=file elem at z-index '-1';\nThe fix is simply to set the input=file elem at something higher than the modal dialog. \nThe implementation is entirely up to you, there are more than one way to do this.\n- hard code the z-index for input=file elements created by plupload\n- use jquery to set it \n- use a non-modal dialog\n- etc\nI've chosen to fork all of this and allow plupload to accept an optional parameter \"browse_button_z_index\",\nto which the caller decides an acceptable value for the browsebutton (and indirectly, input=file).\n(+1 in plupload.js, +7 in plupload.html4.js, +7 in plupload.html5.js)\nCheers!\n.

    "gonchuki": "Interesting, I just did this same patch on my codebase yesterday.\n~~I would suggest using element instanceof Element instead of accepting arbitrary objects (a jQuery object wouldn't work there, for example). This is so that if you pass any arbitrary object, the code that dies is on document.getElementById instead of a random plupload utility function that is trying to work on what it thinks is a DOM element (easier debugging, peace of mind)~~\nedit: the above was a bad suggestion, IE7 doesn't have a native Element.\n. in case you need to see the usage scenario in action: http://nitrous.labs.autodesk.com\nFYI, we are using a hand-rolled queue widget, it's not the one included on the repo.\n. try commenting lines 21 to 29 on plupload.html5.js, the sendAsBinary hack for WebKit causes more problems than it solves.\n. you need to call .refresh() on the uploader object and the flash shim will be repositioned.\n. Does it solve the issues in those 3 items? please also remember that Chrome 14 is at least 10-11 weeks away (based on their usual 6 weeks release cycle), and that the second item is probably triggering an unrelated bug on their handling of typed arrays, either the process running out of memory because it loads the entire file into memory, or simply because they have a loose pointer going out of bounds at the ~ 128MB mark.\n. Nice, I will do some tests as soon as that build lands on the dev channel (seems to be Canary only for now).\n. does this still happen if you disable multipart? (I just want to figure out if it's an issue on the multipart code or something on a lower level, don't have Lion to test.)\n. @ryandemmer: Safari 5.1 does not support sendAsBinary, what it does support is typed arrays and once again as I explained on other bug reports disabling the sendAsBinary hack on lines 21 to 29 fixes this issue.  \nI would just love if one of the plupload devs could jump in on this matter. \n. @ryandemmer can't send a pull request unless we know why this hack was added in the first place. for that, we need a plupload dev to jump in and enlighten us, I'm just a random regular user which happens to have a lot of experience with the library and don't know what are the side effects of disabling the hack.\n. I already reported on #318 that the sendAsBinary hack wouldn't work on newer Chromes and cause side effects. This hack using typed arrays is not viable unless the Chrome team resolves all the related bugs (which at least for 13 and 14 is not the case).\n. same as @fortybillion for me, running open beta since mid-June and no issues so far with my patched code. You should probably remove client-side image resizing altogether, I don't think this has ever been a good idea (except for lazy devs that don't want to implement a proper server-side solution, which is like 1 call to ImageMagick).\n. May I suggest to also check against file size? There can always be mechanisms in the backend to automatically rename an uploaded file.\n2 files with the same name are not necessarily the same file, but 2 files with same name and size is more possible that they are duplicates.\n. yeah, this project gets intermittent activity, so don't be surprised if things look stale for a while. I'm usually around to check ideas of other people and contribute with whatever we modified for our project (being we are building a file manager, uploading files is our core.) We do a similar thing on our implementation, but we check duplicates post factum and raise an error to the user, not allowing to init the upload process until this conflict is solved (not the most elegant solution, I'm actually liking more your idea of not letting the user add the duplicate file at all).\nAs for the pull request, if you push more commits to the branch you asked to be pulled they should just automatically show up here (I see you pushed to master, you should usually make a topic branch for these kind of patches so that other people can safely pull just those commits from your branch in case a project maintainer doesn't accept your request)\n. interesting, for the first issue I don't have that problem. plupload doesn't save the files using the name as a key, they are identified by a randomly generated id, which will be different for 2 copies of the same file.\nfor the second, maybe providing a default to avoid issues with undefined? \ncurFileNames[files[i].name] = files[i].size || null; and curFileNames[file.name] === file.size || null; should do the trick since you are using a triple equals which will differentiate null from undefined.\n. ouch. I guess that you are creating the curFileNames store to avoid traversing the files array for every added file, right?\nThe only mildly reasonable idea I have is to convert curFileNames into a {key: [values]} store. Searches for duplicates will be ugly, you first have to check if the filename exists, then if any of the existing sizes match the one you have (and you will need an old school for loop for it, there's no support for Array.indexOf on IE8 and lower). \n. Are you using client side image resizing or chunking? Just trying to narrow it down as it might have something to do with the fact that Firefox 5 removed Blob.slice as it was also temporarily removed from the spec.\n. Are you using the stable 64-bit Flash release? (10.3 or newer)\nOlder versions wouldn't work anyways, as there was a bug on the beta 64-bit flash player that would prevent the \"select files\" dialog from being shown.\n. is this still needed now that there's proper XHR abort functionality in place? (and similar \"really stop it now, I mean it\" functionality in other runtimes)\n. if (document.body.addEventListener) {\n  document.body.addEventListener('dragover', function (e) { if (e.dataTransfer && (Array.prototype.indexOf.call(e.dataTransfer.types, 'Files') !== -1)) e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'none'; e.preventDefault(); }, false);\n  document.body.addEventListener('drop', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); }, false);\n}\nshort explanation:\n- you need to prevent both drop and dragover for this to work\n- you only want to prevent users from dropping files, dragging and dropping text into forms should still be accepted, thus that's why I check on e.dataTransfer\n- the drop effect thing changes the cursor to the \"forbidden\" one.\n. IE10 should be working, the version shipped in the consumer preview has support for XHR2 and the File/Blob objects.\n. There's a worse problem with this, those mimetypes also need to be defined in the browser itself. I had an issue recently when trying to add .msi files to a filter where Chrome didn't like application/octet-stream so there was simply no way to have a filter for that.\nCan't recall right now what was the fix, but mimetype filtering on Chrome is definitely broken.\n.

Will download the current version linked on your download page! (Will take a little while, I'll get back to you)\n. We decided to drop support for that browser, so unfortunately I won't get the time to test and give you more information about this. Sorry about that...\nClosing this issue.\n. Agree that it's not the optimal solution. But since it's an old version, which is only used by a very low percentage of our visitors, we decided to go this way.\n. ",

From what I can see there are also major issues with Firefox 5.0.1 on Mac as well. Related or not now that Firefox auto updates it seems like the only working browser on Mac is chrome. Someone needs to come up with a correct solution to this problem and fast. \n. The only issue is HTML5 issues are coming up in other browsers as well (Firefox 5.0.1). I would suggest disabling HTML5 in general since the issues all seem to be related to HTML5. Personally not happy with that since I want HTML5 first but it seems like the only way until a viable HTML5 fix is in place that doesn't break other browsers.\n. Agreed. I would rather certain browsers fall back gracefully rather then appear to work and then not.\n. Can anyone at MoxieCode update us on whether to expect a new release anytime soon that addresses these issues? I have a production app that we had to remove HTML5 runtime because of these issues and now the flash portion is falling over because of issues with the 64bit flash player (Chrome and IE). I am a little hesitant to put a non released patched plupload into production but at this point I don't know what to do. Any update would be greatly appreciated.\n. Rock on!

There is still something is missing..\n. Yes ColdFusion is not accepting newly added multipart,I guess there may be some specific format for that. And sorry for my mistake. Not Content-Description but Content-Disposition.\n. I figured it out. If you look at my third attached image in my initial issue description. you will see that your added (unique file id) name is added with name=\"name\" and second Content-Disposition line contains name=\"file\"; filename=\"Desert.jpg\" which is why ColdFusion is getting actual file name instead of our new file name. To make it confirm, I just used updated js code for HTML5 (probably on line no: 2378 if you use http://jsbeautifier.org/ for plupload.full.js minified file) and I am able to get the unique file name on ColdFusion server. I can only figure out for HTML5 code, I guess for flash and silver-light, we may have to update native source code other than the js file and I am not that much technical person. But for HTML5 test works perfect! So I hope that you do some testings for other platforms also and inform me if you make any changes. Also, I am not familiar with forking git or make push request or your source code, but I guess following screen shot helps you.\n\n. Following snap shot says, why it is important to me:\n\n. ",
    "Prinzhorn": "I didn't thought about that. The suggested implementation is also very elegant.\nNow if I update those two lines, how do I add the commit to the same pull request?\nEdit: Funny how it took exactly six months for someone to comment\n. Alright two problems arose:\n- when two different files with the same name are allowed, then they will overwrite each other in the object (they would have the same key), which will ultimately allow duplicates for each of them, except the last\n- not all runtimes provide size (HTML4 -> file.size -> undefined)\nIdeas?\n. You misunderstood the first part. The code you posted (and I want to get pulled) does use the name as key curFileNames[files[i].name]. That's why I wanted to use curFileNames[files[i].name + files[i].size] and came up with the second part.\nAnd for the second part it doesn't matter if \"undefined\" or \"null\" is part of the string. The issue is that the HTML4 runtime will then not allow two different files with the same name. Still better than allowing duplicates, but a different behaviour than the other runtimes, because they would allow two files with the same name if the size differs.\n. \"I guess that you are creating the curFileNames store to avoid traversing the files array for every added file, right?\"\nExactly.\nYour suggestion does not take into account that there's no \"size\" in HTML4. If we ignore that, we could easily stick with the curFileNames lookup and use name+size as key like I suggested in the previous comment.\n. The advantage would be a more responsive UI, because resizing is blocking right now (I guess).\nBUT Web Workers won't work:\n- First, you can't pass references to them. So each image would have to be serialized back and forth (bad idea for multiple MB)\n- Second and most important they can't access the DOM. Which means no canvas which ultimately means no resizing\nSource: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers\nEdit: Source why DOM needed: https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/blob/master/src/javascript/plupload.html5.js#L54\n.

There could be an option 'auto resize' to activate this behavior and a flag 'resize in progress' (with events attached if we get bold)\nDoes that make sense for you ?\nManu\n.

That is, the file just uploaded is removed from the queue, and the \"add files\" and \"upload\" buttons are back, so this seems to be purely a matter of the events not making it through to the Javascript side of things.\nMy code to create the uploader is:\n```\n    $(\"#pluploader\").pluploadQueue({\n        // General settings\n        runtimes : 'flash,silverlight,html5,browserplus,gears,html4',\n        url : \"<?=$uploadpath?>\" + \"&galleryid=\" + galleryID,\n        max_file_size : '20mb',\n        //chunk_size : '10mb',\n        unique_names : true,\n    // Resize images on clientside if we can\n    //resize : {width : 320, height : 240, quality : 90},\n\n    // Specify what files to browse for\n    filters : [\n        {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"},\n        {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip\"}\n    ],\n\n    // Flash settings\n    flash_swf_url : '<?=\"/wp-content/plugins/\" . $_REQUEST['plugname']?>/plupload/js/plupload.flash.swf',\n\n    // Silverlight settings\n    silverlight_xap_url : '<?=\"/wp-content/plugins/\" . $_REQUEST['plugname']?>/plupload/js/plupload.silverlight.xap',\n\n    // Post init events, bound after the internal events\n    init : \n    {\n        ChunkUploaded: function(up, file, info) \n        {\n            // Called when a file chunk has finished uploading\n            log('[ChunkUploaded] File:', file, \"Info:\", info);\n        },\n\n        Destroy: function(up)\n        {\n            log('[DESTROY]');\n        },\n\n        Error: function(up, args) \n        {\n            // Called when a error has occured\n            log('[error] ', args);\n        },\n\n        FilesAdded: function(up, files) \n        {\n            // Callced when files are added to queue\n            log('[FilesAdded]');\n\n            plupload.each(files, function(file) \n            {\n                log('  File:', file);\n            });\n        },\n\n        FilesRemoved: function(up, files) \n        {\n            // Called when files where removed from queue\n            log('[FilesRemoved]');\n\n            plupload.each(files, function(file) \n            {\n                log('  File:', file);\n            });\n        },\n\n        FileUploaded: function(up, file, info) \n        {\n            // Called when a file has finished uploading\n            log('[FileUploaded] File:', file, \"Info:\", info);\n        },\n\n        QueueChanged: function(up) \n        {\n            // Called when the files in queue are changed by adding/removing files\n            log('[QueueChanged]');\n        },\n\n        Refresh: function(up) \n        {\n            // Called when upload shim is moved\n            log('[Refresh]');\n        },\n\n        StateChanged: function(up) \n        {\n            // Called when the state of the queue is changed\n            log('[StateChanged]', up.state == plupload.STARTED ? \"STARTED\" : \"STOPPED\");\n        },\n\n        UploadComplete: function(up, files)\n        {\n            // Called when files where removed from queue\n            log('[UploadComplete]');\n\n            plupload.each(files, function(file) \n            {\n                log('  File:', file);\n            });\n        },\n\n        UploadFile: function(up, file) \n        {\n            // Called while a file is being uploaded\n            log('[UploadFile]', 'File:', file, \"Total:\", up.total);\n        },\n\n        UploadProgress: function(up, file) \n        {\n            // Called while a file is being uploaded\n            log('[UploadProgress]', 'File:', file, \"Total:\", up.total);\n        }\n\n    }\n});\n\n```\n.

Copying this from the plupload forum, since this seems like the place to address issues.\nAs a followup:\nI\u2019m using v2 of the YouTube API, since v3 is not yet frozen, and following the browser-based uploading pattern described here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_browser_based_uploading\nFor this pattern, YouTube claims the expected response is a 301 (Moved Permanently) upon successful upload of a video, but in my experience the API actually issues 302 (Found).\nhttps://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/reference#Response_codes_uploading_videos\nMost other successful YouTube API interactions result in 200 or 201, just not uploading.\nI\u2019m basing the interaction partially on source for the CORS example page:\nhttps://gdata-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gdata/youtube_upload_cors.html\nI post some XML to youtube to create a video object on their end with particular metadata. They return a single-use url to upload the file to, along with a permission token. The token and URL setting works, and plupload uploads the file to youtube successfully (it shows up on my youtube profile), but the response from youtube never gets through and the connection is aborted. The response following a successful upload should be the aforementioned 302, with the ID of the new video as one of the get params of the Location header URL.\nI guess I\u2019m not entirely aware if the browser even lets you intercept 301/302 responses and access the \u201cLocation\u201d header. Reading the w3 spec it sounds like the expected behavior is to transparently follow the redirect.\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/\nIt\u2019s possible there is a cross-site issue and that I\u2019m not setting headers correctly, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem. Examining the request-response cycle with the Chrome Inspector or Wireshark shows that it seems to work OK, but is aborted by Plupload or possibly the browser.\nI\u2019m looking to grab the destination url for the redirect either from the \u201cLocation\u201d header, or via xhr.responseXML.baseURI.\n. I second  magnyld's request, it would be nice to have access to the full XHR object in the error function as well. I also need to access the XHR headers in the 'Error' function in order to upload to the YouTube API. Even if it does not work in all runtimes, if it does work in HTML5 that's enough for me.\n. > Request headers and status codes other than 200 and 404 are not guaranteed across the runtimes.\nWhich runtimes do not pass through the request headers? Google Gears is officially discontinued.

I've set chunk_size to 1mb and files < 1mb are being sent in 4 chunks. HTML5 does it right.\n. Just an update. I'm still having issues with the new flash object.\n. I've been doing some more testing. This seems to be a webkit only problem as I've been unable to reproduce this on Firefox (10.0.2) and Opera (11.61) under Mac OS 10.7.2.\nSafari and Chrome versions being used are 5.1.2 (7534.52.7) and 17.0.963.65 respectively. Flash version being used: 11.1.102.62 (although Chrome shows 11.1.102.63).\nWill try to perform same tests on a Windows machine and report back.\nA fix on this would be most appreciated as I'm unable to revert back to 1.5.1.x (there's a bug with client-side resizing (a must have feature) using flash, i.e. the first uploaded image is never resized). I'm in desperate need of help here !.\nThank you in advance.\nEDIT:\nCurrently using Plupload 1.5.2 with provided plupload.flash.swf listed above.\n. @jayarjo \n\"always having at least 4 chunks was meant to be a feature. Sorry if it is confusing. Does it makes you trouble?\"\nYes, saw that on another ticket. Thanks for the info, and sorry for mixing different problems on same ticket. Should have opened a new issue in the tracker.\n\"So are you saying that even with the swf provided above you still experience the freeze? Then why you thought at some point that it resolved it?\"\nYes, it still happening with the swf file listed above. The freeze problem is random. No pattern so far other than this is only happening on webkit browsers. I thought it was fixed since it stopped freezing after replacing the file, but then it started all over again. It would seem that it freezes a lot less though, but there's no way of confirming this other than running a monte carlo test :).\n. @jayarjo Sure, here's the config being used:\n{\"max_file_size\":\"2048mb\",\"chunk_size\":\"2mb\",\"resize\":{\"width\":800,\"height\":600,\"quality\":100},\"max_file_count\":20,\"filters\":[{\"title\":\"IMAGE_FILES\",\"extensions\":\"jpg,jpeg,png,gif\"}],\"url\":\"xxx\",\"multipart_params\":{\"action\":\"upload\",\"container\":\"xxx\"},\"runtimes\":\"flash,html5,html4\",\"unique_names\":true,\"multiple_queues\":true,\"rename\":true,\"sortable\":true,\"multipart\":true,\"flash_swf_url\":\"xxx\"}\nHowever, the problem is present with any config I've tried so far, e.g. with and without resizing, different max_file_size & chunk_size, etc. The server side code is pretty much the same as in the example code. I can post it in if you like. Same code works fine on v1.5.1.1.\nHope this helps.\nPlease let me know if you need anything else.\n. @leonardteo Just tried 100 uploads (5 batchs of 20) on Firefox with no freeze (100% of files were successfully uploaded). 3rd upload (1st batch of 20) attempt on Chrome and it freezed.\n. @jayarjo Any update on this ?.\nAfter a series of tests I've came to the conclusion that Plupload is currently unusable on Chrome (at least mac) for uploading images using client-side resizing and the flash runtime. v1.5.2 hangs as described in this thread (issue reproduced on 3  different macs), v1.5.1 doesn't hang but first image never gets resized and on v1.4.3.2 the uploader freezes while uploading the 3rd image of a batch (client-side resize enabled). This is a real deal breaker while providing public upload interfaces for others to use.\nPlupload has been a pleasure so far and I would really love to help. Unfortunately I have near zero Flash skills. I'm more of a backend than a client-side guy.\nAny help for helping on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks again !.\n. @jayarjo Sorry it took me this long for getting back to you.

What does your modalbox form look like? Is there something misspelled or mis-cased?\n. But you have to have HTML boxes...such as the browse button and so forth. Can you use gist to paste the whole page code?\n. I have made some changes and forked it. The issues that I see is \n1) You needed to have a div named container since you were using the option named container.\nThese other changes I might also do though.\n2) You want to have an anchor tag as the \"Upload Files\" not an input type of \"file\". This makes it cleaner.\n3)  You have an initialize in the body that does not seem to be initializing anything (at least what you've shown). Don't do this though...having inline scripts is not a good practice.\n. @marioandujar - I'm not sure what your problem is. I ran it on my server and had no problem. http://ibc-static.broad.msu.edu/test/ - The first thing you have to do is click the Add Photo as all your code relies on the Add Photo being clicked first. Not sure if you are trying to hide the modal, but mine won't hide with your code. Maybe you should take the code out of the button, especially for initialization, but this is not an issue and should be closed.\n. Which browser(s) are you trying it in?? I was able to get it to work in versions of Chrome and FF11. Also, do you have more of your code? I'm wondering if there is something weird with other parts.

    "chrisgraham": "No, because gears and flash work via extensions, not mime. And the overall framework does a file extension check on top of whatever checks the particular uploaders do. So it is worthwhile to give valid extensions without being restricted to recognised mime types.\n. If you restrict only to mime types, you can't use file types that aren't registered mime types recognised by the browser. That's alright if you're staying with some real core file types, like the web safe image formats, but there are loads of file extensions with no registered mime type. You'd also need to move the hard-coded plupload mime types to be configurable, as you literally can't even use all kinds of files that are mime registered right now unless you hack the plupload code or don't use the HTML5 uploader (example: .gz files).\nMaybe it was not a problem until recently, I guess Chrome recently implemented the mime-type filtering and this became a real problem rather than a theoretical one.\nplupload itself works with file extensions half the time. So even if we throw away the mime type checking, it does check file extensions, even with the HTML5 uploader. It can do that by looking at the filename of the chosen file in the HTML5 upload field. So the closed off world of mime types (closed off by the need for the browser to know them, and closed off unnecessarily in the plupload code) is a bad way to force plupload users to go, and not the only way to go due to the current existence of file extension checks.\nAll I propose is that we have some HTML5 way in plupload to allow non-mime-registered file extensions, which are always going to be around.\n.

    "Arcara": "Hi\nI would like to know if the folder uploading function will be incorporated to plupload 2, and why it's not in the latest releases of plupload 1.5.7 although the code is here. I'm trying to add it to this one, but I'm not able to add the files of a folder to the plupload component.\nThank you very much,\nCarlos\n. If not too much to ask, do you know approximately when it will be available in the main branch of plupload 2?\nIt's very useful and I'm hesitating between waiting it or programming me on the server side another way to upload files keeping the folders structure (ej: uploading a zip file and uncompress it).\nThank you very much for your attention and congratulations for your work, plupload is the best upload component that I know.\n. I'm seeing the code, and I see the calls to webkitGetAsEntry and else, but I don't see any reference of relativePath or any other way to know the path of each file (of course, this is null when drag&drop folder and its files). Can it be done at present?\nThank you very much\n. Yes, when I drag & drop a folder with subfolders and files inside, all the files appear in plupload, but I need to know what is the folder structure of each one of the files to uploading in order to I can clone the whole folder structure (with its files) in my server.\nSo, I thought that each one of the files in the array 'uploader.files' had a property '.relativePath' or similar in that manner I could do something like this:\njavascript\njQuery('#uploader').plupload('getUploader').bind('BeforeUpload', function (up, file) {\n       up.settings.multipart_params = {'originalFileName':file.name,'totalSize':file.size,'relativePath':file.relativePath}\n});\n. It would be very useful and the easiest way to be able to upload files from different folders without mixing them and preserving the original order (that sometimes is complex and shouldn't be lost). \nIn many cases is necessary preserve in the server the same folder structure that in the CD/DVD/USB/HDD of the computer (I.E: to separate docs from videos and photos, and inside each one, to maintain all the subfolders with the date or place in wich they were made).\nAt present and without this function, to preserve the folder structure, firstly I have to create manually, one by one, all the folder structure (it can be big), and later go with plupload to each folder for uploading all its files, and go on with the next folder.\nAlthough at the moment it only works with Chrome, it would be the only but at the same time a great way to reach that objetive much more easily and quickly.\nOf course, if anyone use other browser different than Chrome (and I hope firefox provide in the future something similar to webkitGetAsEntry), .relativePath would be null and would have no other option that put all files in the same target folder.\nThank you very much for your attention\nCarlos\n.

    "ddellacosta": "After looking into implementing a version of foaly-nr1's workaround above, I realized that there are indeed some issues that need to be addressed, and it's probably a bad idea to go too far down this road right now.\nThere doesn't seem to be any API for getting the path of a File that is widely supported by browsers.  The webkitGetAsEntry() call in foaly-nr1's code (which provides an Entry) is a part of the FileSystem API, which is apparently dead (\"Work on this document has been discontinued and it should not be referenced or used as a basis for implementation.\") as of April 2014 (via html5rocks.com) and is obviously not well supported in browsers other than Chrome and Opera.  The other API for handling files that does seem to be supported widely is the File API, but that API doesn't seem to support anything that would allow a developer to get ahold of the path.\nPoint being, it seems that it would be a bad idea to depend on this feature even if it is incorporated in plupload at this time, based on the state of the relevant web specifications.  While I don't agree with jayarjo that having the feature itself would be confusing, even if it were not fully supported by vendors--clearly there is developer demand for this, and developers can choose to ignore anything they don't feel comfortable implementing for whatever reason--otherwise I would agree it shouldn't be incorporated because it doesn't seem likely to be supported in the future.\nI'd love to be shown to be wrong here--but as far as I can tell, the deceased FileSystem API is the only API that provides path information for files in conjunction with the Drag-and-Drop API.  It also follows, sadly, that foaly-nr1's workaround is probably not a good thing to rely upon even in Chrome or Opera, as there is no guarantee this API could be available in any future releases.\n. Follow-up counterpoint from my boss, for your consideration:\n\nThe HTML5 standard being abandoned doesn't necessarily imply that the chrome filesystem api\nwill be abandoned. They've already gone beyond what the HTML5 standard was proposing:\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_storage\nHere is a discussion where the chrome team is saying that their api will remain and be supported\nas they use it for their apps, and internally as well:\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-apps/k39Lb1VYWEI\n.

Yea, I agree that urlstream_upload is poor option, especially as we are uploading to S3, which doesn't support chunked uploads and there's no indication that it will anytime soon. A lot of less technical savvy users have trouble if there's no actual progress bar. Indicators that something is happening can help, but it's not great.\nGiven that at least some of these errors occur after the upload is successful, it seems to be something that can be worked around if it's a flash issue (i.e. not a bug in plupload). I'm attempting to use the approach @krzkrzkrz for those situations, although I'm a little unsure what needs to be done in this case (e.g. how do I access the response in this callback? If I can't access the server response, I can't submit the form because I don't know the url for the uploaded image).\nThe situations where this error occurs during upload are even less obvious. Has anyone figured out exactly what is going on in this case?

All of our users who reported this problem have seen it go away since the latest stable chrome release, 21.0.1180.83\nHas the problem resolved for others here or does it still exist?\n. @exinferis, This sounds different since it is affecting multiple browser types (the original problem was Chrome-specific, probably since Chrome comes with its own version of flash). Maybe this issue is more relevant? https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/596 or https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/593\n. It works here.

Note this (refresh()) is required anyway for FlashPlayer as it will not script or position until it is in a visible container.\n. Ah, of course the issue is obvious when you think about it.  The WebKit folks do not want you to accidentally click on a input type=file (as now with HTML5 DataTransfer these present security challenges).  As such if WebKit is convinced the actual element is un-clickable, it does not allow the direct trigger of click() either.\nA simple fix is to either:\n1. Make the dialog non-modal (not the best option)\n2. Move the 'hidden' button up above the glasspane (demostrated by this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/stevemayhew/PhCsp/3/embedded/result/)\nA fix pull request will be forthcoming... Stay tuned.\n.

If someone could look into this, I'll put up a fiddle.\nThis brings us to the next issue: (position of input=file)\n2 - The [input=file]'s position (or rather, its parent form's) is at (0,0) because the browse button position is undefined when plupload first initialized. So when the user press \"Add files\", input.click is not fired and there is no input=file underneath it as a workaround.\nThis is easily resolved by calling refresh() on the modal dialog \"open\" even\nNot a big deal, once getPos() works.  Would be nice if you did not have to remember this step, but documenting it is good enough.\n3 - The third issue is with the input=file z-index being lower than the modal overlay.\nBecause of that, regardless whether input=file is triggered through onClick event or through a physical mouse-click, \nthe browse dialog will not show up.\nUpon creation of the input=file element, the code puts it one index lower than the browseButton.\nThe issue here is that browseButton has a z-index of 0 (rather, its not defined).\nThis puts the input=file elem at z-index '-1'\nThe fix is simply to set the input=file elem at something higher than the modal dialog. \nThe implementation is entirely up to you, there are more than one way to do this.\nhard code the z-index for input=file elements created by plupload\nuse jquery to set it\n\nI've got code that automatically choses the correct z-index for the plupload generated container/input.  It will work for all cases \nexcept where positioned elements do not share the common offsetParent (which the plupload solution fails for anyway), It will \nwork perfectly for all jQuery dialogs and tooltip like created dialogs.\nI'll work this week to get it tested with a demo fiddle and make a pull request.  Better then adding more parameters.\n\netc\nI've chosen to fork all of this and allow plupload to accept an optional parameter \"browse_button_z_index\",\nto which the caller decides an acceptable value for the browsebutton (and indirectly, input=file).\n(+1 in plupload.js, +12 in plupload.html4.js, +12 in plupload.html5.js)\nCheers!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

That works well when you're not resizing down more than half the original size.

The resulting image looked a lot better than the first attempt and only took a little longer to run than resizing in one step...\"\n. If development of this has stalled, an alternative is needed.

    "filmo": "Awesome. Worked. Thanks.\n. I'll give the required_features setting a shot. \nIt did not upload the file because the media file (7mb) was larger than the PHP upload limit (I'm assuming). It silently failed. \nIs required_features covered in the documentation somewhere? Did a quick search and all I found was a reference on the configuration page but it doesn't indicate what settings are available or under what circumstance it might be needed.\n. Yes, but that's 80% of the battle... ;)\nClients are the wild-card variable here and as a general rule, \"If they can do something stupid or illogical, they will\". \nHaving a prevent_duplicates setting may reduce client error and decrease upload times. (If they stupidly upload the same 100MB file 3 time, then the upload will take far longer than if two of them where detected immediately.) A lot of users are 'in a hurry' and also have little or no comprehension of how long it takes to upload large files over the internet, and/or generally incompetent with computers. We see this behavior ALL-THE-TIME with our current Java Applet which I'm gradually replacing with plupload. \nWe already have software on our server side that detects duplicates. I've modified the upload script provided by plupload so that each batch of uploads goes to a temp-folder based on the upload id. Upon completion, those files are moved immediately out of the temp folder into secondary folders. Thus if they upload the same file 'again' it is caught on the server prior to getting moved to the secondary folder and/or flags our software to ignore the duplicate file.\nIt's a better user experience to prevent the duplicates prior to the long upload than to catch the duplicates on the server after they've already spent all that time uploading the files. \nIn a forum post on duplicate files, I provided some extension to a user's code that seemed to work okay at accomplishing this, but it could definitely be better. Right now it doesn't provide any visual warning/alert that a duplicate file has been silently removed.\nhttp://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=10187#p10187\nIf you want to jump in on how to access the notify methods to accomplish this remaining task, it would be much appreciated. I'm trying to figure out how to make it pop the Error DIV one sees when adding a file that's blocked by the filters.\n. The following browsers are allowing \"myfile.mov.zip\" to be drag-and-dropped into the queue despite \"zip\" not being in the filter list.\nChrome for Mac ver. 25\nChrome for Windows v. 24 and v. 25\nFirefox for Windows v 18 and v.19\nFirefox for Mac v15 and v18\nWhen using the file browser to load files instead of drag-and-drop:\nSafari, Chrome for Mac, Chrome for Windows, and Explorer for Windows: behave as expected and prevent \"myfile.mov.zip\" from being loaded.\nFirefox for Windows and Firefox for Mac: allows filtered file to be loaded via browsing.\nThus, it seems like Firefox is the worst performing of the group, allowing both \"drag-and-drop\" as well as \"dialog-box-loading\" of the prohibited file.\nHere's my FilesAdded code. Loosely adapted from some of the forum posts for removing duplicate files from the queue. Based on what I'm seeing, it doesn't seem to get triggered on the 'working' browsers that are correctly rejecting \"myfile.mov.zip\". \nI've tried running the code with my \"FilesAdded\" overload commented out and I'm still seeing the behavior, so  I think the problem lies elsewhere.

Okay so upon further investigation, it seems like silverlight does not seem to be 'chunking' correctly. I went back to the original jquery_ui_widget.html code to test this.\nIrrespective of what filter you use, if the file is larger than the chunk size, I'm getting the error that it's 'not finding' the upload url. If I put a file in less than chunk size, then it ~does~ upload the file correctly.\n``` javascript\n        runtimes : 'silverlight',\n    filters : [\n        {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"},\n        {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip,avi\"}\n    ],\n\n```\nI modified filters to the following for testing:\n``` javascript\n        runtimes : 'silverlight',\n    filters : [\n        {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"},\n        {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip,avi\"}\n        {title : \"Audio files\", extensions : \"mp3\"}\n    ],\n\n```\nIf I remove the filter entirely, I still get the same error.  \nThe error occurs the first time the script tries to reach the upload.php script. I removed the test /plupload folder that was created by the upload.php script when run successfully with flash or a file smaller than chunk size. The plupload silverlight runtime does ~not~ successfully call 'upload.php' when it has to chunk.  This failure is evidenced by the fact that the upload.php doesn't create a new 'plupload' folder like it should when called for the first time without an existing folder. \n\nNotice on the above image that the error occurs approximately 12% through which corresponds roughly with when the first chunk should have been fired off.\nHere's my full code from the example file \"jquery_ui_widget.html\"\n``` javascript\n$(function() {\n    mOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-aiff,aif aiff\");\n    mOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-ms-wma,wma\");\n    mOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"application/vnd.rn-realmedia, rm ra\");\n    mOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"application/octet-stream, dss\");\n    mOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-aac, aac\");\n$(\"#uploader\").plupload({\n    // General settings\n\n//      runtimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight,html4',\n        runtimes : 'silverlight',\n        url : '../upload.php',\n    max_file_size : '1000mb',\n    max_file_count: 100, // user can add no more then 20 files at a time\n    chunk_size : '1mb',\n\n    // Specify what files to browse for\n    filters : [\n        {title : \"Image files\", extensions : \"jpg,gif,png\"},\n        {title : \"Zip files\", extensions : \"zip,avi\"}\n        {title : \"Audio files\", extensions : \"mp3\"}\n    ],\n\n    // Rename files by clicking on their titles\n    rename: true,\n\n    // Sort files\n    sortable: true,\n\n    // Enable ability to drag'n'drop files onto the widget (currently only HTML5 supports that)\n    dragdrop: true,\n\n    // Views to activate\n    views: {\n        list: true,\n        thumbs: false, // Show thumbs\n        active: 'list'\n    },\n\n    // Flash settings\n    flash_swf_url : '../../js/Moxie.swf',\n\n    // Silverlight settings\n    silverlight_xap_url : '../../js/Moxie.xap'\n});\n\n\n// Handle the case when form was submitted before uploading has finished\n$('#form').submit(function(e) {\n    // Files in queue upload them first\n    if ($('#uploader').plupload('getFiles').length > 0) {\n\n        // When all files are uploaded submit form\n        $('#uploader').on('complete', function() {\n            $('#form')[0].submit();\n        });\n\n        $('#uploader').plupload('start');\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You must have at least one file in the queue.\");\n    }\n    return false; // Keep the form from submitting\n});\n\n});\n```\nHere's the header of the example file:\n``` html\n\n\n\n\n production \n\n\n```\n. Whoops! I accidentally hit the 'close' button. The issue is still 'open'.\n. plupload_2_0_0beta.1308111349\nFixes the problem with Silverlight Chunking. \nI was able to upload a file larger than chunk size with the Silverlight runtime.\n. Thanks for the response. So based on your response and the FAQ, what is the best way to prevent the upload from even starting. Is there a way client side to check file type and 'abort' or 'remove' the file from the queue.\nI understand that this could be 'worked' around by a malicious user, and we have server side code that already deals with the inappropriate files once they're uploaded, but I'd prefer that the client side user receive an alert up front indicating that the file type is not allowed. Most of our clients uploading 'illegal' file types aren't doing so maliciously, but rather because the just aren't that computer savvy.  Given that these are large media files, it would be better for a client side alert prior to upload rather than after an hour or two of upload time. If there are some class methods I should investigate with regards to this, please point me in the right direction.\nI understand what you're saying about not relying about this client side alert and that it could be overcome by a malicious user.\nThanks for your time.\n. Hi, Sorry I always conflate the jquery.ui widget with the plain version of plupload and failed to mention that this occur when using the widget.\nThe issues came up when I was using the jquery.ui widget which I had assumed already handled this type of error catching. I'm going to try to figure out which browser allowed the files to get by the jquery.ui widget that is included with the plupload code.\n. Thanks!! I noticed that your link is not accessible from the main wiki page.\nQuestions: \nmax_retries\nI'm assuming that the 'failure' of a chunk is based on a response from the server side script? or is it based on some sort of timeout on the client side? Or both. \nIf a chunk fails, what needs to be handled on the server side to make sure that any partially received chunk is discarded or correctly overwritten. (Seems like a good example of when using offset seeks would be advisable to prevent file corruption.)\nchunk_size\nI'm assuming that chunk_size will directly affect how much memory a PHP script will use. If you post a 10MB chunk to the PHP handler, that instance of of the php handler will require at least 10MB memory. While probably not a problem with smaller installations, if you have 500 users uploading simultaneously, you get into a serious memory issue on the server side. ???\nIf chunking is false, then I would assume that the server side instance of the PHP script will require as much memory as allowed by PHP ini. Additionally, if PHP ini has a maximum post size (which is normal), I would assume that the upload will fail for any non-chunked file larger than the maximum post size.\n. Hi,\nI'm now completely confused... :)\nI've been working off the provided UI example files and uploader script. Perhaps you can provide some guidance as to best practices/configuration.\nHere's what I've been trying to accomplish:  An instance of the jQuery UI uploader which will:\n- use the following runtimes in this order 'html5,silverlight,flash'\n- be built for handing large files by default. Our average file size is 100 MB and growing over time.\n- be 'resumable' without corruption via the 'start'/'stop' button on the UI\n- ideally be 'resumable' even to session termination or browser close/reopen.\nThe last one (handling complete session terminations as resumptions) is on the wish list, but I really want to get the first 3 nailed down.\nI'd really like to leave Flash in the runtime due to its ubiquity. I'd say it's the most likely 'runtime' across all browsers as most people do not have Silverlight installed. HTML5 is gaining ground, but no where near as common as Flash.\nI'm not clear if I'm supposed to enable or disable 'chunking' in my configure file given my goals?\nAre there other errors I've made in my configuration file?\nIt seems like rather than using the default 'uploader.php' as the start point, I should use something that takes into account offset and total file sizes?  Or perhaps you mean that this is no longer recommended and we should work off the provided uploader.php. I'm totally willing and capable of engineering the php script to accommodate the server side changes necessary for dealing with offsets. (server side php is my strong suit, client side jQuery, much less so.)\nIs there any downside to 'send_chunk_number=false' other than the complication serverside for seeking and offsetting when writing to the partial file?\nCurrently my PHP script already places each user's files in temporary sub-folder and then moves them out upon completion. I'm passing the value of uploader.id to the PHP script and creating a tmp folder based on its value.\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\nmOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-aiff,aif aiff\");\nmOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-ms-wma,wma\");\nmOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"application/vnd.rn-realmedia, rm ra\");  \nmOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"application/octet-stream, dss\");\nmOxie.Mime.addMimeType(\"audio/x-aac, aac\");\n\n$(\"#uploader\").plupload({\n    runtimes : 'html5,flash,silverlight',\n    url : 'plup_upload.php',\n    max_file_size : '1000mb',\n    max_file_count: 100, \n    chunk_size : '1mb',\n    unique_names : false,\n    multiple_queues : true,\n    // this used to be 'access_binary'\n    required_features: 'chunks', // forces Safari 5.x to dump HTML5 and move to Flash\n    filters : [\n        {title : \"Uploadable Files\", extensions : \"mp3,wma,mp2,wav,aiff,aif,m4a,ra,dss,mov,mp4,wmv,rm\"}\n    ],\n    rename: true,\n    sortable: true,\n    dragdrop: true,\n    views: {\n        list: true,\n        thumbs: false, // Show thumbs\n        active: 'true'\n    },\n    default_view: 'list',\n    remember_view: true, // requires jquery cookie plugin\n    flash_swf_url : '/js/plup-2013-08-13/Moxie.swf',\n    silverlight_xap_url : '/js/plup-2013-08-13/Moxie.xap'\n});\n\nvar uploader = $('#uploader').plupload('getUploader');\n\n/* This bind to FilesAdded may no longer be needed in most recent\n    version of plupload.

I have succesfully uploaded to Amazon S3 using yout example with both Flash and HTML5 runtimes and both failed when tried using the HTTPS protocol. It returns \"Upload URL might be wrong or doesn't exist.\"\nPerhaps extra configurations are needed?\nThanks for looking into this.\n. Yes, I have that file copied from your provided file example and that's how I get it to work with flash using HTTP protocol. It has the secure=\"false\" code.\nI would like to suggest improving the Error managment. For example if using Flash and Amazon and there is an access error you could return a message explanining that probably the crossdomain is missing. If there it answer from Amazon but the upload failed then display the message from Amazon, etc. If would definetly reduce the amount of related issues I see all around.\nAnyway will study this deeper and feedback my conclusions. Thanks :+1: \n. I'm using Plupload 2, the core version, wrapping it with my own plugin with Boostrap UI. I must tell I learned a lot with your code and the result is just amazing!\nIf Flash is restrictive perhaps you could suggest in the error message to use HTML5 to understand why is not working, if the HTML5 error reporting is improved, of course. As this messages can be confusing for end users, perhaps could be shown only when developing. For that a kind of Develop mode could be added, just a paremeter when enabled more detailed messages are shown or some extra Events start working, etc. Just a suggestion :)\n. Thanks. I have updated my bucket permissions as explained in the doc but using httpS still doesn't work. I tried both with and without the port 443 in the url.\nUsing http works as expected.\n.

Yes, your example works well. I have created a new Bucket with US Standard Region, max permissions to everyone, CORS as described. Still not working =/\nWhat bucket region is your example using if I may ask?\n. Then I'm out of clues, must be some bucket setting that I'm missing.\n. Yes, I just updated the cors again and still the same. FF say Upload URL might be wrong or doesn't exist.\nBut I think I found an workaround. Don't know why but using this URL instead it DOES work!\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketname/\nPerhaps you could test it and document it if anyone else have the same issue :)\n. You are right, even with my alternative URL solution if the bucket name has a dot will fail in some ocasions (not sure why but it's not working very stable).\nI guess the conclusion is to avoid using strange bucket names. For my script will leave the https and an custom error report with this info if it fails.\nThank you for all the effort :)\n. Searching around, this issue is confirmed by Amazon and I think the SSL is important enaugh. The bucket names can use '-' instead.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3048236/amazon-s3-https-ssl-is-it-possible\nCheck the accepted answer.\n. Great!\nI would like to point out that is not necesary to grant permission to everyone in order to upload as it's currently stated in the docs. In fact that's not recommended at all. The only permission necesary is the default one, of the owner, which is authenticated with the signature and policy provided with the request.\n. I found an workaround for this using the BeforeUpload event:\nuploader.settings.multipart_params.key = file.name;\nuploader.settings.multipart_params['Content-Type'] = file.type;\nI updated also the content type as it is also static.\nSuggestion: it is possible to pass the FormData object in this event? If possible to edit it will make much easier to extend and perform workarounds.\n. I don't feel its the correct way to change general params on each upload, but meantime it should be documented and perhaps Plupload UI should adopt it to fix the issue.\nWhat do you thinkg of the FormData Object, is that an object ready to be easily modified before send for example?\n. No, I have build my own plugin around Plupload, why?\n. Good luck :)\n.

This is for Google Storage but I'm guessing other providers might allow wildcard prefixes too.\n. @jayarjo, ah yes. Sorry I only saw a few messages in the thread. It sounds like that would work. The last part where you delay the upload is what I didn't know I could do before. Since getting a new policy via AJAX would be async, I'd need to go that method but yes that would address the issue.

You need to adapt it to your needs and your code.\nDOES NOT LOAD IT IN onLoad. It will break in IE because plupload will try to communicate with Flash object added to the page but it is not load yet. Making sure it will load only after Colorbox load, we make sure the page is ready to recept flash object and the browser can communicate with it.\n. I was receiving the same error message on plupload 2 with flash, but with plupload 1.x upload works fine with urlstream_upload set to true.\nEven showing this message on plupload2, when I check to upload folder there the file was. It means that upload works, but it does not bind at FileUploaded event, but Error. Check if the file was saved at upload folder.\nI suggested an workaround that will only works if file was really saved that was commented at https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/728\nWhen an Error occours and it be = \"-200\", connect to the server to check file existence. If file exists, do not show alert with error message.\nTry to update your flash version and Silverlight version. Adobe does not provider support for any earlier Flash Player version, how can be read at their FAQ: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/archived-flash-player-versions.html\nAdobe Technical Support doesn't provide support for installation or use of earlier versions.\nJust a tip: I recommend you put silverlight AFTER flash at runtimes. Silverlight enter Maintenance mode (how can be read at Microsoft End of Life Cycle). It means that Silverlight 5 is the latest release and it will only receive security fixes. End of Life of Silverlight is at 2021.\n. That's OK, I compromise to update VBScript code and BAT too, giving support to it to anyone who needs until 2020 (Windows Server 2008 End of Life). \nplupload is amazing, everything I can do to help this project will be done.\nIn the future (2020) I will update the code to PowerShell (that is deployed with Windows 7+ and Server 2008 R2+). But it is not the case now because Windows Vista and lower Windows's OSes still needs manual PowerShell install. I think the user wants to download the code and \"See it working\" as fast as possible and using VBScript there's no dependence to install to make it working.\n. It's fine.\nI will update the code until 2020 or plupload 1.x End of Life, what comes first.\nI want to learn to build with Node.JS (I think I need to run Jakefile.js, but I not tested and not sure yet). Moxie builds fine, plupload does not give life signal.\nI think Apache Ant is more easy, even with it boring installation in Windows.\n\nEdit: I build plupload 2 with Node.js (v0.8.21 x64) with success! I commented about it at https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/714\n. If you want to mantain support for Gears and Browserplus, that's OK!\nBut please note that in the commit that I have removed then there is an update to build.vbs. If you pull it to the plupload repo, make sure to update build.vbs according to the latest commit.\nI have updated examples urls and other files at Removed support for Gears and Browserplus commit. Please read commit description to more details.\nWhen I removed Gears and Browserplus, I moved the readme.md original (not modified with the right URL to Flex SDK), so I needed to modify that again, how can be seen at last commit (Updated Readme.md (Flex SDK URL)).\n.

    "ovkhasch": "Sorry about the confusion. I didn't noticed that you updated the build. Double checked this: plupload_2_0a.24010015 works. plupload_2_0a.21021401 doesn't.\n. And with the latest build I tried to use the following code as a workaround:\n```\n            FB.Canvas.setAutoGrow();\n        var fileref=document.createElement('script');\n        fileref.setAttribute(\"type\",\"text/javascript\");\n        fileref.setAttribute(\"src\", \"plupload/js/plupload.full.min.js\");\n        if (typeof fileref!=\"undefined\") {\n            document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(fileref);                                  \n        }\n\n```\nThis doesn't solve the problem because at first canvas size is set correctly but it won't change when the content is updated.\n. With plupload_2_0a.22021333 setAutoGrow works as a charm! Thanks alot!\n. My temporary solution includes two things:\n1. I exposed runtimeCan as runtimeCanExt in plupload.Uploader.\n2. Used the following code to detect if resize functionality is available:\n        var blob = file.getSource();\n        if (blob != null) {\n            return this.runtimeCanExt(blob, \"resize_image\") && !!~$wnd.o.inArray(blob.type, ['image/jpeg', 'image/png']);\n        }\n        return false;\n. Are you sure that there's an onresize event? I found there onerror, onload and onembedded. And, again, what can I do in onerror when the code already failed during loading/resizing image? I wanted to prevent JS errors that IE will display to the end user. I am not an experienced JS programmer, but it seems to me that doing check before loading an image in the main codepath is more convenient approach compared to recovering in error handlers. Especially taking in account the fact that I use GWT wrappers around the JS code.\n. I didn't double checked, but, as I remember, html4 code failed before onerror event for the image was triggered. I mean that failed the code that had to trigger onerror event.\n. Davit, thanks for helping me with this!\nI checked that both for html4 and for html5+GIF cases onerror is triggered. I simply had an invalid handler. Sorry for the incorrect information.\nFor IE9+html4 I show an image file name instead of thumbnail. The user is able to upload fullsize images in IE9, then these images are scaled on the server side. The same thing I do for GIF and BMP in html5 case. So I'd like to keep html4 as a backup for uploading, why not?\nThe bad thing about onerror is that it doesn't give me any information about what's being wrong. It can be a corrupt image or simply IE9 scenario or GIF image in html5 case. If I will use it I won't be able to tell if I should try to upload to server or show an error message to the user. It would be nice to have several meaningful error codes for different problems. However, I can always proceed with uploading and check for bad images on the server side - your suggestion about using onerror makes sense!\nAh, yes, now I found the resize event and others... This was my bad knowledge of javascript :(\n. I'd better leave this issue open as you may want to provide more error details in onerror parameters.\n. Just FUI - I was able to implement my scenario as you suggested using onerror and onload.\n. The browse button itself is not visible. When I displayed it and tried to click it with the mouse - browse dialog appeared even with plupload.full.min.js.\n. I believe that I commented this issue but cannot see my last comment here. I had both flash and silverlight installed in IE 10. I had all possible runtimes in the list...\n. Here's my configuration (through GWT wrapper, but hope that it is quite clear what happens there)\n            this.builder = new PluploadBuilder();\n            builder.runtimes(\"html5,flash,silverlight,html4\");\n            builder.flashUrl(\"/plupload/js/Moxie.swf\");\n            builder.silverlightUrl(\"/plupload/js/Moxie.xap\");\n            builder.multipart(true);\n            builder.multiSelection(false);\n            builder.container(browseButton.getElement().getParentElement().getId());\n            builder.browseButton(browseButton.getElement().getId());\n            builder.dragAndDropTarget(dropTarget.getElement().getId());\n            builder.listener(this);\n```\n        int maxDimension = appctx.getCreateAdvtConfig().getAdvtImageSizeMaxDimension();\n        builder.resize(maxDimension, maxDimension, 100, false);\n    plupload = builder.create();\n    plupload.init();\n\n```\n// image preview resize settings\n            imgSettings = new PluploadImageSettings(80, 80, imagePreviewPanel.getElement(), plupload);\nBoth flash and silverlight runtimes work fine. Also, I noticed that the previous version version of my app works in IE9 mode. The difference of the new version is that I hide the browse button and when there's is a click event  from an anchor, I pass it to the hidden browse button to trigger the file browse dialog.\n. ",

This is on a custom server, most recent version of flash, chunking disabled since with flash it stores it in the memory which eventually causes IE to crash. I'm just merely baffled by this, because smaller files work without any issues, but as soon as I try a file larger then 200MB, it causes this issue.\n. @jayarjo I actually found the problem. My clients VPS has only 1344MB of ram, and cPanel has been a hassle with getting restrictions changed. We are in the process of switching servers now, since after testing on my servers with the same setup worked without any issues. As far as with using Flash, the chunking just causes issues on large files which in result causes the browser to crash, so I need to figure out if it's runtime is flash, then to disable chunking.\n.

I'll keep an eye to see if any new failures come in today. \nNot sure about the Amazon logs to be honest, it would be nice to see the actually post body in this instance from their side. Their logs appear to be a pretty standard  combined log format. I'll do some more research.\n. Thanks for your time on this, I hope it is an interesting puzzle.\nThis is probably overkill because we make changes to the upload settings as we go, but I'll explain the process we take in case anything we're doing along the way rings any bells. \nWe initialize our uploader to begin with for the most part single queue, filtering a few file types, allowing multiselection, etc. In order to upload to S3 in the correct location we create an asset on our server and pass back the relavent S3 policy pointing to the correct key say 'assets/000/000/001/original.wav'. We initialize the upload and make an ajax call in 'BeforeUpload' to create the asset on our server, this returns an asset object and S3 policy as JSON.\nWe overwrite the name of the uploading file 'name' and 'Filename' with something like 'asset_001' because non-ascii UTF-8 characters get messed up being passed as a JSON string (and subsequently no longer match the S3 policy) and we have to supply both 'name' and 'Filename' in the post and the S3 policy because of Flash on IE seems to post both which blocked us for a while. We set the additional parameters for the S3 policy and call up.trigger('UploadFile', file)\nIn terms of grabbing the post body it seems impossible to log on Amazon, it would be pretty huge anyway, and only the uploader itself will be able give us the body its posting to S3.

Yes.\nSince I am developing for a J2EE server application, my upload backend returns a JSON object, which contains several attributes about the just uploaded file, among them is the new file's server path, its id and display name. So the name (which is \"\u00e4\u00f6\u00dc\u00c4\u00d6\u00dc.txt\" in my example) with the special characters is contained within the JSON object (as a substring of attribute values) at least three times.\nI am developing on IE9, I also tried the various compatibility modes, quirks mode on and off. No difference.\nThanks for your help.\n. I just had a quick test with Plupload 2.x: same problem....\n. Davit,\nmany thanks, that saved my day!\nI moved a bit up in the hierarchie and chose the table element as Plupload container.\nThat worked!\nAgain, thanks a lot!\n. Addendum:\nI just found out that the error occurs, if I access my web application using a subdomain.\nI.e.\nhttp://test.toplevel: works\nhttp://sub.test.toplevel: Security Error\nIn my searches regarding this problem, I read some posts about an hidden iframe rendered by the HTML4 runtime.\nIs there maybe some domain relaxing necessary?\nRegards,\nSascha.\n. Hi Davit,\nif someone deploys my application on a subdomain that causes this error?\nEvery applications resource is requested from that same somedomain, so there shouldn't be a cross domain issue at all, should it???\n\"Domain relaxing\" means removing subdomain by setting e.g. document.domain=. in the correct moment.\nRegards,\nSascha.\n. > Do the domains of the page with Plupload and that of upload url differ or no?\n\nNo, they don't differ.\nWhat would be a correct moment to do domain relaxing in our case you think?\nhtml4 uses hidden iframe to upload files.\nYes, I read about this hidden iframe.\nAt the moment, since page url domains and upload url domains don't differ, I can imagine that iFrame bears a different domain.\n\nSince that iFrame is hidden, I can't grasp it with developer tools / Firebug to examine that...\n. I just tested Plupload 2. Same problem here...\n. By the way, dropping files still works, only browse button seems to be affected...\n. Hi,\nafter some more investigation, it seems as it is some issue caused by our Server, not Plupload.\nWe are developing for SAP Netweaver Application Server. Currently a colleague of mine is experiencing a similar issue in Firefox 22 and Chrome >= 27, unrelated to Plupload, but also concerning some input field.\nAt the moment, in both our cases I see a similarity in how input click is triggered: There is a click listener for a wrapping HTML element, which will trigger click on the real input field, just like moxie.js does:\nlines 6119ff:\n\nEvents.addEvent(browseButton, 'click', function(e) {\n  if (input && !input.disabled) { // for some reason FF (up to 8.0.1 so far) lets to click disabled input[type=file]\n      input.click();\n  }\n  e.preventDefault();\n}, comp.uid);\n\nBoth don't work in our server environment and FF22 / Chrome 27.\nIt seems as if we'll rather have to talk to SAP to....\nI will close this issue, since it doesn't seem to be plupload specific.\nThanks for your help.\n. > Mmm... not sure how a server can interfere there...? \nI debugged moxie.js into the code fragment quoted above and found out that upon \"input.click();\" a piece of code sent from our application server's JS framework is executed which might interfere here.\nSame happens to my colleague, who doesn't use Plupload in his project, but also has an input field, the click on which is triggered by a wrapping HTML elements handler.\n\nWould be glad to hear how this story ends, no matter what solution you end up with.\n\nOf course, I'll keep you posted.\nThanks,\nSascha.\n. Dear @zepcatsal , indeed we were able to track down this issue to the SAP Application Server. Since the application server provides a whole portal with Javascript framework, there are always additional JS files send to the client, which do not belong to the application to be called itself, but to the surrounding framework: Navigation, permissions, browser handling and so on.\nObviously belonging to the last section, we found a piece of JS code which is loaded and does the following:\ntry{\n    document.createElement('span');\n    HTMLElement.prototype.click = function(){\n    if(typeof this.onclick=='function')\n        this.onclick({type: 'click'});\n    }\n}\ncatch(exception){\n}\nIf you take a look at the statement \"document.createElement('span');\", you can imagine, that this piece of code must be quite old and must have slumbered for many years without harm until the release of recent Firefox and Chrome versions.\nThis defines a click method on all HTMLElements prototype and thus overwrites browser default, preventing the execution of custom click handlers waiting for a click event.\nOur research turned up:\n- originally click method was not implemented on clickable HTML elements\n- click method is part of HTML5 standard. During the process of HTML5 implementation, previous versions of Mozilla Firefox (21 and before),\n  retrofitted click function on selected HTML elements, but explicitely on the elements itself, not on their prototype.\n  => this is why this fragment didn't cause the bug in previous versions of Firefox\n- new Firefox 22 introduced click method on all HTML element's root element, which is \"HTMLElement\".\n  => now this method is overwritten by sapUrMapi_nn7.js and thus prevents\n  execution of click handlers waiting for \"click\" event.\nFor further reading you might take a look at this document: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.click\nI hope this isn't to much detail, but it explains why the current behaviour we're experiencing isn't caused by Plupload. At least in our case....\n@zepcatsal : I wish you all the best to get your problem solved!\nKind regards,\nSascha.\n. > @srissel serious investigation there!.. although not sure if we should fight this... or how :|\n@jayarjo : No problem, we posted this to SAP support. This isn't your problem. If they temper with browser default behaviour, it's theirs.\nTo everybody else experiencing this issue:\nYou might take a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2812411/click-works-in-ie-but-not-firefox.\nThis helped us restoring the original browser behaviour.\nKind regards,\nSascha.\n.

I think as developers we should embrace all efforts to make our lives easier :).  \nI can't imagine the testing nightmares involved for plupload but I'm all for any approach that can use feature detection rather than unilaterally tying functionality to specific browser brands (or worse, specific browser/version combinations) whenever possible.\n. The issue we experienced is resolved; we just needed to set an ID on the container and pass it to the container property as described in this thread.  \nThe IE10 comments were just added as food for thought and because IE 10 did seem to function correctly for me with triggerDialog set in a trivial test.

This is great, but its for JPG only \n. Probably same issues as :\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/828 and https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/831\n.

Is set to true already since beginning\n. set max_file_count to > 0 will make multiple_queues to false by itself ?\n. So if multiple_queues false is raised above error because I was set max_file_count then there is no chance to limit maximum user uploaded file from plupload ui frontend ?\n. yes.\nI am trying your jsfiddle demo:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/dependencies/ui/jayarjo/plupload-demos/tree/master/2.x/ui/bundled\nStep:\n1. Upload\n2. Remove that files from list\n3. Start Upload button and Add Files is disabled\nBy that mean is I cannot add another file, is that the way to work ?\n\n. If possible  the uploaded file should not have '-' delete button, or Add Files Button kept enabled and so does Start Upload Button.\nWhat do you think ?\n. Sorry about multiple_queues Re-activate the widget after each upload procedure, what does it mean, on what condition ?\n. I am also experienced this in last commit\n. That would be great to include Traditional and Simplified as both has some differences in writing texts.\n. I have same experience within bootstrap 2.3.2\n. @jayarjo thanks\n.

My bad, I suck at explaining!\n1. The issue is now in html5 runtime\n2. It happens when you select multiple files at once\n3. You need to have at least 2 large files and 1 that would generate a preview\n4. The one that will generate the preview needs to be in position 2 or above\nIf you wait until everything loads + a few seconds, you will see that the canvas generated for the OK size is added several times. It seems my \"formula\" is a bit wrong. It's actually generated 1 + (numBigFiles before this one in the queue - 1).\nYou can test this way:\n1. Grab http://all-free-download.com/free-photos/seaside_landscape_highdefinition_picture_166129.html\n2. Copy file 3 times, rename them to 1.jpg, 2.jpg etc\n3. Find an img you know will generate a preview, rename to 5.jpg\n4. Open the jquery ui queue in firefox/chrome, add all 5 files at once\n5.

Can I just 'cp -r' from the source tree?\n. OK, it seems I can copy straight from src/javascript in the git repo to our project's release dir of 1.5.7 and run with uncompiled source.  Our problem is that plupload is being initialised in a div with display:none, which means the \"Init\" event (bound with uploader.bind(\"Init\") results in a getStyle call on it is returning undefined, so the lines:\nif (uploader.settings.container) {\n  container = document.getElementById(uploader.settings.container);\n  if (plupload.getStyle(container, 'position') === 'static') {\n    container.style.position = 'relative';\n  }\n}\n.. and in getStyle:\nreturn window.getComputedStyle(obj, null)[name];\nis breaking because getComputedStyle in getStyle returns null.

I mean that .destory() is a function: \nfunction(){this.stop();this.trigger(\"Destroy\");this.unbindAll()}\nThus it's not clear object from memory, because a pointer to object is still active.\nTo clear plupload instatnce ihmo we should do:\nuploader.destory()\nuploader = null; //now js garbage collector may delete instance...\nIMHO, IMHO, IMHO ))))\n. In js it's impossible to make \"selfdestory\" action for variable. Thus we need some wraper for pludpload instance, but in this case - there are so much to do and so much to rewrite in api.

I like the wait until thumbnails are shown solution, would probably add to that, the error event (for anyone else that happens on this...) otherwise non-images or images too large to show a thumbnail, will never get uploaded I believe.\nAs far as possible changes in the actual plupload library, like you said, it would be ideal if some sort of error was generated.  This was not easy to track down as far as I did when dev console is not reporting any problems, and at same time not reporting any upload even though plupload reports the file being uploaded...\n. You might be right, having resize on could have simply been causing the problem in #903, either that or changes in the latest code fixed it.  Using the latest plupload.full.min.js from github updated 13 hours ago, and with my work-around for #903 in place, it now seems to work great in IE9.

Took me a while to figure out that just the act of commenting out the resize:... line instead of removing it was causing additional problems!\n. I was trying to troubleshoot this problem, went as far as installing MS visual studio so I could run emulator...  (Someone was reporting issues with file uploads using windows phone on our own software that uses plupload 2.0)  It doesn't work with any mode.  It will \"try\" to load html5 but I think the detection may falsely think it works with HTML5 when it doesn't.  I made it load only flash and it didn't even try to load.  Same for silverlight and html4, from what I can tell windows phones are not able to upload files at all.  Source about html5 file api support (or lack thereof):\nhttp://mobilehtml5.org/\nThinking the \"fix\" here may be to fix the detection, right now it seems to falsely think html5 method will work when it does not fully support the file API spec for html5.  (and I could be coming to wrong conclusions here so feel free to correct me)  That way at the very least, it can be coded to display a message saying your browser doesn't support file uploads.\n. ",

Probably others already have server-side fixes for this, so your \"fix\" is overkill.  To be fully safe and compatible, you could have an optional switch 'ios_rename' that defaults to true but can be set to false by the caller.\n(For my own purposes, I've commented out your fix and got everything working in my own private copy... but I'd prefer a fix in the master source.)\n.

Ok... now it works just fine in the flash example in plupload.com..\nBut still, when i'm running the 2.1 version in my plupload.. it wont work..\nCan you see something that i dont?\n/* Uploader init */\n    $(\"#uploader\").pluploadQueue({\n        // General settings\n        runtimes: 'flash,html5,silverlight,html4',\n        browse_button: 'uploader_browse',\n        url: UploadbigfilesServiceAddress + 'plupload/Handlers/UploadfilesLogic.ashx',\n        max_file_size: PL_Max_File_Size,\n        chunk_size: PL_Chunk_Size,\n        max_retries: PL_Max_Retries,\n        send_chunk_number: false,\n        unique_names: true,\n        rename: false,\n        dragdrop: true,\n```\n    // Flash/Silverlight paths\n    flash_swf_url: UploadbigfilesServiceAddress + 'plupload/js/Moxie.swf',\n    silverlight_xap_url: UploadbigfilesServiceAddress + 'plupload/js/Moxie.xap',\n// PreInit events, bound before any internal events\npreinit: {\n    Init: function (up, info) {\n        log('[Init]', 'Info:', info, 'Features:', up.features);\n\n        if (StartButtonLocation == 'he-il') {\n            $('.plupload_add').css({ 'position': 'relative', 'right': '80px', 'cursor': 'pointer' });\n            $('.plupload_progress').css('direction', 'rtl');\n            $('.plupload_upload_status').css('direction', 'rtl');\n        }\n\n        $('.plupload_upload_status').css('font-size', '12px');\n        SetUploaderClearButton(ClearButtonValue, StartButtonLocation);\n        SetStartButtonLocation(StartButtonLocation);\n\n        /* uploader custom actions & ui */\n        $('#uploader_clearlist').css('visibility', 'hidden');\n        $('#canDel').css('visibility', 'hidden');\n\n        $('#uploader_clearlist, #canDel').click(function (e) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#uploader\").pluploadQueue().splice();\n            SetDisplayFields('hidden');\n        });\n\n        //add timer\n        $('.plupload_progress').after('<div class=\"plupload_file_time\"></div>');\n        /* custom button events & validations */\n    },\n\n    UploadFile: function (up, file) {\n        log('[UploadFile]', file);\n        // You can override settings before the file is uploaded\n    }\n},\n\n// Post init events, bound after the internal events\ninit: {\n\n    Refresh: function (up) {\n        // Called when upload shim is moved\n        log('[Refresh]');\n    },\n\n    StateChanged: function (up) {\n        // Called when the state of the queue is changed\n        log('[StateChanged]', up.state == plupload.STARTED ? \"STARTED\" : \"STOPPED\");\n        if (up.state == plupload.STARTED) {\n            $('#uploader_filelist').scrollTop($('#uploader_filelist li:nth-child(1)').position().top);\n            totalHeight = $(\"#uploader_filelist\")[0].scrollHeight;\n            if (Number(totalHeight) > 185) {\n                IsScroll = true;\n            }\n            document.title = StartTitle;\n        }\n\n        if (up.state == plupload.DONE) {\n            document.title = FinishTitle;\n        }\n    },\n\n    QueueChanged: function (up) {\n        // Called when the files in queue are changed by adding/removing files\n        log('[QueueChanged]');\n\n        var iter = 0;\n        while (iter < up.files.length) {\n            if (up.files[iter].name.indexOf('.') == -1 && up.files[iter].size % 4096 == 0) {\n                alert(NoFolders);\n                up.splice(iter, 1);

Ok, sorry about all the mess, my Moxie files worn't in the correct path.. :(\nNow i fixed that issue.. and i have a diffrent problem..\nc.getshim() is null...\nmean anything to you?\n\n. Ok.. thanks, you helped me to solve it :)\n. So all i have to do is to remove the \"max_retries: 10,\" line?\n. Thanks!\n. The Fix:\nBasic.each(e.dataTransfer.items, function (item) {\nvar tmp = item.webkitGetAsEntry();\nif (tmp) { entries.push(tmp); }\n});\n_readEntries(entries, function () {\ncomp.trigger(\"drop\");\n});\nneed to be fixed on the min file too.\n. In plupload.full.min.js:\nfunction(e){if(e.preventDefault(),e.stopPropagation(),c=[],e.dataTransfer.items&&e.dataTransfer.items[0].webkitGetAsEntry){var n=[];t.each(e.dataTransfer.items,function(e){if(e.webkitGetAsEntry()){n.push(e.webkitGetAsEntry())}})\n. using Chrome 32.. \nany file gave me that error...\nDont have any other choice but to editing until newer version of Plupload will be released..\n. Yes i think this is it, #983 \nBut i downloaded 2 weeks ago from here, and yesterday from Plupload.com, and both versions had this bug.\n. Windows 7\n\n. Ok, Thanks.\n. Hi..\nActually i haven't.\nBut when i think of that issue again, i actually need to use the ChunkUploaded event:\nOn server side, with the offset option i can calculate and see if this is the last chunk. If its the last chunk, i check the actual size of the file on my server. In some cases, as i mentioned, the upload process is not completely working and the file is equal to 0KB. \nMy main problem is that file.max_retries is undefined event if i set this property.\nSo i want to do something like that on server:\nif (file.lengh == 0)\n{\n     threw new exception();\n}\nand in the ChunkUploaded event:\nChunkUploaded: function (up, file, info) {\n            if (info.status == plupload.FAILED)\n            {\n                if (file.max_retries == up.max_retries)\n                {\n                    file.status == plupload.FAILED; \n                }\n            }\n            // Called when a file chunk has finished uploading\n            log('[ChunkUploaded] File:', file, \"Info:\", info);\n        },\nand in the end, retry on all the faild files:\n```\n        UploadComplete: function (up, files) {\n            SetFields(up);\n            // Called when all files in a queue are uploaded.\n            log('[UploadComplete]');\n            var Complete = false;\n            if (up.files.length > 0) {\n                if (up.total.failed == 0 && up.total.queued == 0) {\n                    Complete = true;\n                }\n                else {\n                    if (curTry >= maxTry) {\n                        for (i = 0 ; i < up.files.length; i++) {\n                            var file1 = up.files[i];\n                            if (file1.status == plupload.FAILED) {\n                                RegisterErrorfiletoDatabase(mailSessionId, mailSessionIdBigInt, maillConfirmationCode, file1.name, file1.target_name, file1.loaded);\n                            }\n                        }\n                        Complete = true;\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        for (i = 0 ; i < up.files.length; i++) {\n                            var file2 = up.files[i];\n                            if (file2.status == plupload.FAILED) {\n                                file2.status = plupload.QUEUED;\n                            }\n                        }\n                        curTry++;\n                        up.start();\n                    }\n                }\n            if (Complete) {\n                UploadComplete(mailSessionId, mailSessionIdBigInt, maillConfirmationCode, up.total.loaded, up.runtime);\n            }\n        }\n    },\n\n```\n. But i do so...\n$(\"#uploader\").pluploadQueue({\n    // General settings\n    runtimes: UserAgentFallBack,\n    url: UploadbigfilesServiceAddress + 'plupload/Handlers/UploadfilesLogic.ashx',\n    max_file_size: PL_Max_File_Size,\n    chunk_size: PL_Chunk_Size,\n    max_retries: 25,\n    send_chunk_number: false,\n    unique_names: true,\n    rename: false,\n    dragdrop: true,\n. Nope..\nOn this example i get:\nfile.max_retries == 'undefined'\nChunkUploaded: function (up, file, info) {\n        if (info.status == plupload.FAILED)\n        {\n            if (file.max_retries == up.max_retries)\n            {\n                file.status == plupload.FAILED; \n            }\n        }\n        // Called when a file chunk has finished uploading\n        log('[ChunkUploaded] File:', file, \"Info:\", info);\n    },\n. Ok, my bad.\nSo any idea how to force to stop the retries on the chunks and change the file's status?\n. But the problem is that the Plupload think that the upload process is just fine and have no idea that the file was not uploaded successfully. I need a way to force the stop of the retries and to re queue the file.\n. In some cases the upload process in the server side wasn't successful and the file size was 0 KB. Still try to figure out why.. \nWill continue to work on it. Thanks.\n. Hi..\nWe are waiting for very long time for this feature in Plupload... Any idea when it should be released?\nThanks :)\n. Thats what we are looking for. \nWhen are you going to add this property? this week? next week? we want to update and test it :)\n. Thanks :)\nWhen it should be release? do you know?\n. found the solution:\njust add\n//check for file.size undefined and remove them from list\n                $.each(uploader.files, function (i, file) {\n                    if (file != undefined) {\n                        if (file.size == undefined) {\n                            $('#' + file.id + '.plupload_delete a').click();\n                            updateList();\n                        }\n                    }\n                });\nin the end of updateList() method\n. I think i can fight it from another way..\nIf i detect that the PC is MAC, i will implement a hidden iframe and every 2 minutes i will do something inside of it, and the computer will never go to sleep (the client told me that she upload and play youtube at the same time and the computer keep the upload alive.\n. No, its only for the users with unknown platform:\nIP: 85.64.203.176\nBrowser: Unknown\nVersion: 0.0\nPlatform: Unknown\nRequestType: POST\nWhat have been changed?\n.

Thank you for the suggestion.\nLet me try and explain how exactly I am able to reproduce the scenario. \nFrom my webpage (which uses the plupload plugin), I upload a file (e.g. some word doc) to my web app. The uploaded file gets stored in Azure, but I don't think that has anything to do with the problem. In my app, we can upload the same file multiple times. It creates a new version for each upload on the server. So, after uploading the file a couple of times, when I am trying to open the same file (on my computer) and edit and save it (locally), I am getting the above error. I hope I could explain the problem better. \nI have tried upgrading to the latest version of the plugin but I am still facing the same issue.

Thanks. Corrected all these, but made no difference with IE11.  Still huge initial delay for 100MB upload, and then requests are seemingly throttled at 2 requests / second, and no progress. With HTML5 everything works fine, and produces at least 20 requests/second.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5950738/1556977/21f49ef2-4ef7-11e3-8582-c0f69fff58f1.png\" />\n. Tried not with IE11, but a fresh W7x64 SP1 VM with IE8 + latest flash from Adobe. There, progress is displayed occasionally, at random intervals, like above: long delay, 28%, 40%, 44%, 53%, 67% etc. even though with 100MB file and 1MB chunk it's expected to be 1%, 2% etc (and it does work like that with HTML5 and silverlight)\n. Well, in the application we're developing the plan is to use plUpload precisely for large file uploads (hundreds of megabytes / gigabytes) and IE8 is a large % of the users, so chunking and progress are required. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, neither \"the progress bar updates do not fire at all, or fire at random intervals\", nor the \"2 requests per second throttling\" issue, affect IE8 + 1.5.7 + Flash. There is still very long delay at the beginning, when the file is read to memory (~40 seconds to read 500MB file from SSD is a bit long w/o progress), but after that the chunks fly fast, at least 10/second. </p>\n<p>Same vanilla W7 SP1 IE8 + no updates + Flash (11.9.900.152) VM, same server side, same client HTML, but plUpload 1.5.7 (just one line difference):</p>\n<p>```\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head runat=\"server\">\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n<!--    <script src=\"scripts/plupload/plupload.full.min.js\">    -->\n     \n\n\n\n\nNo runtime found.\n[Attach files]\n\n\n",

    "jendaneu": "If you run the fiddle in ff you will see that entire page is loading after pressing Upload button.\n. I use newest version of FF and I don't return application/json. In fact it's not so critical to me cause FF supports html5 properly and I have html5 on the first place among runtimes. But still it seems like a bug. The same bug is in newest version of Chrome and Opera. I use Windows platform anyway.\n. When I run the fiddle above in newset FF on Windows platform (Windows 8) and upload some 80MB zip I always get full page refresh. Maybe it's because of application/json here on fiddle but you spoke about old browsers and especially IE which is not the case. Furthermore I get this buggy behaviout also on my web app where I don't return application/json. Anyway it's not too important to me (rather an interesting issue to you) as I mentioned that newest FF, Opera and Chrome supports html5 well on all platforms. If you can' repeat it just close the thread. Thanks.\n. Thanks for reply, sorry now I see I did not explaine this issue correctly. There are two problems that I detected, not one. I mean that Opera does not work without chunking with html5 runtime and Silverlight does not work for ie >= 10 (I did not tested lower versions yet). Please try this http://jsfiddle.net/wfc4s/ to see Silverlight issue. I tried to upload some 1.5 GB file and it just stops on 24% and throws error. Regarding Opera please just try to upload larger file (1-2 GB) on Windows platform for html5 runtime without chunking. I use newest version of Opera for Windows.\nThanks a lot.\n. Ok thanks. \n. If I run this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/8QLjh/ and try to upload zip file which is 1.2GB it does not work - nothing happens.\n. No it does not work even in my app. Mabe it's because of the browser / client mode? I don't know what it means.

Changing the runtimes order allows to get the library initialized.\nWithruntimes: 'flash,html5,silverlight',`, no error occured, and I could upload a file.\nIt seems the 'html5' runtime would cause this issue.\n. Ok,\nI guess one of my colleague found what caused the issue. The problem was due to the container option, that was set to null in another location of the application. In this case, the error occured. If the container option is set to undefined, no issue.\nIt would be great that null and undefined are treated the same way in the library. What do you think about that?\nI close the issue.\n. ",

Now I know that I should not use the minified version of Flash as it has all the image manipulation code removed. (Or is this presumption incorrect?)\nThe API I'm uploading data to wants only the \"metadata\" content-disposition form data and does not like other content-disposition data passed along.

However, a successful upload always replies with a redirect, and it would be a preflighted CORS request, which is not supported by design. See documentation at w3.org and MDN.\nThe alternative is to make a PUT call to a TempURL. Plupload only supports POST call, so I had to make an option to change that. Also, the URL is different for each file. Accepting a function for the url seemed like the cleanest way to achieve that.\n. BTW, I was trying to make plupload work wit flash (which could be an alternative for my case), and I couldn't.\nI tried to simply modify this fiddle (linked in https://github.com/jayarjo/plupload-demos) to have only flash. Unfortunately, I get an Error #-500: Init error.. I guess there's a bug to be fixed there.\n. Yes, it's a requirement of the Rackspace API. The url to make the PUT contains the file name in an encrypted pre-authenticated way. If the I want to upload a different file, a new URL is needed.\nI'll try the flash from the package.\nBTW, if I didn't want html4, could I use only the plupload.min.js instead of plupload.full.min.js? I tried it, but I fails to load because mOxie is not defined.\n. This is a typical Rackspace TempURL:\n```\nhttps://storage101.dfw1.clouddrive.com/v1/MossoCloudFS_xxx_guid_xxx/A_Container/ScreenShot_2014-01-24.png?temp_url_sig=an_hexadecimal_encoded_signature&temp_url_expires=1390585262\n``\n. Flash and Silverlight could potentially useX-HTTP-Method-Overrideto make aPOSTthat is actually aPUT`\nAnd I'm not sure uploader.setOption would work when uploading several files when the url has to be different for each one. One would have to synchronise the setting of the option between each upload. Also, it would make it almost impossible to implement concurrent file uploads.\nSadly, for our case, I'm starting to feel that we'll have to build a component ourselves.\n. Setting the url on BeforeUpload could work just fine. I quite a fan of accepting functions when a value could vary. Underscore does it a lot. See how much this lookupIterator is used there.\nRackspace currently doesn't accept X-HTTP-Method-Override, but they re considering it. I have some contacts there. :secret: :wink: \n. In my particular case, large file uploads are a common usage. Now that I know that flash loads the whole file into memoty, I guess it won't be an option.\n. ",

You don't want a guy with a phone uploading\nan 8Mb thumbnail. So for this, the resize has to happen on the user device.\nBut on a large resize, the image quality is terrible. I understand that\nbicubic takes some horsepower. But going down to a small size, I assume\nwould keep that minimal. To the user it would just seem like a slightly\nlonger upload?\nFor the resize... Again with thumbnails, you want them all a uniform aspect\nratio. So as long as you are resampling the image, might as well crop it.\nIn terms of the upsample... same argument. You want them all a uniform\naspect ratio. Since the downsample is able to crop them to an aspect ratio,\nthe smaller images need to be processed accordingly. I don't really need\nthem to be upsampled. But cropping them to a consistent aspect ratio would\nbe very desirable for consistency. Display size can be dealt with by CSS.\nIt still makes sense to do the crop here. You have a handle on the image\nalready. A crop would not take any horsepower.\nOne other thing I would like to implement but can't figure out how is to\nupdate the new image on the page rather than having to pull it from the\nserver again. HTML5 could do it. But I can't figure it out with plupload.\nIdeally in the BeforeUpload I could get a handle to the new resized image\nand update an image tag on the page with the new data. Maybe you can do\nthat already? I just can't figure out how...\nCould I use a similar hook and maybe do the crop myself before uploading?\nMaybe that would be a good way to deal with exceptional use cases like\nthis?\nIn my specific case, I don't need a preview before uploading. I'm using one\nbutton with an instant upload. I just want to update the page without\nhaving to reload. I tried refreshing the URL with javascript but that\ndoesn't always work due to timing and caching.\nI agree with your concern to keep it simple here. It really is a great\ntoolkit already. If I have to do any heavy lifting, I of course can do it\non the server. But with a tiny bit more on the client, I can avoid all of\nthat. The thumbnail resize quality really needs to be improved otherwise I\ncan't get good data to the server.

The problem is that there is a default error event bound when the plupload UI widget is initialized that displays a set of default error messages when an error occurs during upload.\nSo, if you write a custom event handler for the error event your handler will always get called before the widget's default error event handler. Any error message you display using the notify method gets hidden by the default error handler when it calls notify.\nIt would be nice if you could just set a custom error message to display.\nHere is the part of code I'm referring to in jquery.ui.plupload.js:\n```\nuploader.bind('Error', function(up, err) {          \n// Other code removed for brevity.\n\nself._trigger('error', null, { up: up, error: err } );\n\n// do not show UI if no runtime can be initialized\nif (err.code === plupload.INIT_ERROR) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        self.destroy();\n    }, 1);\n} else {\n    self.notify('error', message);\n}\n\n});\n```\n.

Unfortunately I don't have this publicly accessible, however I put up a pastebin with my html, maybe i'm just doing something stupidly wrong?\nI have the same issue in Chrome 33.0.1750.146, and using IE 11 (both windows 7 x64)\nhttp://pastebin.com/8CKhE2V6\n. Ok.. So here's what i've found out so far with the dev version.  The jquery.ui.plupload.js file on line 1050 makes a call to preloadThumb (inside the lazyLoad() function). For whatever reason, the self.getFile function is not actually getting anything the second time through. I broke the code out into a few sections to verify that it was pulling the element ID properly and it was getting that. However even though my \"thumb\" variable (see below) was set, when I started debugging inside the preloadThumb function, the file was undefined.  I am using jquery 1.11.0 for whatever that's worth.\nvar thumbshift =  thumbs.shift();\nvar thumb = $(thumbshift).attr('id');\npreloadThumb(self.getFile(thumb), function() {\n    loading = false;\n    lazyLoad();\n});\nStrangely, if I turn off thumbnail mode, I don't get any errors in the console, however it  still is leaving the 2nd file in the upload box.\n. Ok so i've found that somehow the addFiles function is running in the plupload.dev.js, but the things that seem to check for max files are in the jquery ui code. The plupload.dev.js doesn't have anything in the filters for the max files. I'll do some more digging into the jquery ui plugin to see if I can't pinpoint the problem farther but it may not happen until late tonight or tomorrow.\n\n. yes, I have put it on a clean page with only plupload on it.

Using the \"add files\" button seems to work ok (although after removing a file it does not re-enable the add files button but that will be something else to tackle later).\nAnd here is a zip of my files i am using as well as the html file for those who wish to try to replicate / debug. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4835827/uploadSinglePluploadBug.zip\n. @jayarjo What do you mean checking against the latest build?

    "calmdev": "+1 I'm running into this issue installing from composer.\n. @jayarjo using composer as a web project dependency manager isn't limited to only PHP projects. There are many well known javascript libraries and even CSS frameworks who publish packages to composer. The real benefit is that once dependencies are required and installed with composer, from that point forward all the dependencies can be easily managed from the command line.\nMy specific use case is for a university \u2014 Florida Institute of Technology (www.fit.edu)\nWe have TONS of in-house and student projects to maintain. For example, our assets server has 100+ jquery plugins. Extremely time consuming to manually track all these down, check for new versions, upgrade, etc. Viewing what dependencies a project uses, what versions all of them are at and being able to easily update them is where composer comes into play.\nI am not sure what you mean by it not being ready out of the box. I simply install with composer, then in my templates I reference the moxiecode/plupload/js/plupload.full.min.js and everything (at least what I am using with core API) just works.\nDoes that help clarify my use case?\n. Yep, I was going to mention Bower \u2014 I figured you'd be familiar with that one! I use bower with all my node.js projects. I can understand your confusion with composer, because I had the same thoughts too initially. Given the nature of node.js we really only tend to see JS and some CSS packages there....no need for PHP or language XYZ packages.\nIn the PHP world it seems like nobody uses node.js tools like bower. Or maybe people just don't want yet another technology dependency - i am not sure. Composer can be distributed as a stand-a-lone PHAR (PHP Archive) which can be used like a typical cli tool so maybe people are just more comfortable with that.\nFWIW, I do like bower more than composer. I originally did try using bower with the php projects, but found myself using composer for all the server-side PHP libraries. So instead of using two package managers I ultimately decided Composer for PHP and Bower for node.js\nAnyways, nice talk and thanks for your work with PL Upload and TinyMCE. I 've been using them both for several years and they are great.\n. ",

I just wonder how this plays with \"retries\".  Until now plupload did retry on response codes other >= 400, which might not always be appropriate, eg. 406 means 'unacceptable' which probably means the server rejects it for reasons of size or extension, which probably means reuploading it is just a waste of bandwidth, where as 400 means bad request which maybe means there is some network problem involved. Response 500 as well might benefit from retrying. \nOk, I now see that HTTP_ERROR only get's thrown after retrying, so this probably has no influence on that. \n. I'm still seeing a bit strange behavior when it comes down to the http error and the trigger \"CancelUpload\". onError calls uploadNext.call(up); However, if there is no other files in the queue, the state remains at  plupload.STARTED. Now if you add new files to the queue and call uploader.start() nothing happens, because it's state is already STARTED. Apart from that, I'm calling start() in an event handler on 'filesAdded' because 'autostart' doesn't seem to have any effect for me.\nI can file separate issues for these problems if that's deemed useful.\n. What I'm seeing is that when an http error occurs,  'file.trigger('Error', {' happens, but the function onError is bound to the uploader and not to individual files, so it isn't run. As far as I can tell the code in onError that now depends on 'if( error.code === HTTP_ERROR ) is unreachable, which means that uploadNext never gets called, which would have taken care of putting that state to STOPPED. \n. ok, thanks, that explains what's happening. I'll keep an eye on the evolution of the master branch to see when these issues get resolved.\nFor now as a workaround I called uploader.stop(); uploader.start() on http errors, and that seems to work.\n.

Regarding #1, Try calling init once you've made the dialog visible as\nplupload cannot properly init on a hidden browse_button.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 11, 2014 at 4:36 PM, nilesh-shah notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi Team,\nWe are using PLUpload in our application. We came across 2 issues while\nusing PLUpload and these 2 issues are specific to IE9.\n1) On the page, we have a button, on click of which we are opening a\ndialog box (Jquery dialog). The dialog HTML was kept display none before.\nThe Dialog HTML has \"browse\" button which is getting configured as\n\"browse_button\" for plupload. However see that, when dialog opens, the\nbutton is disabled and on click of it, file dialog does not open. We are\nusing silverlight runtime.This issue is intermittent.\n2) Another issues we are seeing is, on IE9, at times, uploader.total.size\ncomes as undefined. it is not able to calculate the file size and hence\ngoes into error handler and say that file size exceeds even though the\nselected file is under the size range. However, when we re-attempt, the\nthings work fine.\nCan you please guide us for these 2 issues. For now, issue#1 is more\nimportant for us.\nThanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1177.\n. Are you sure the other browsers are actually using Silverlight and not\nHTML5? I have noticed there is some cross-over where some functionality of\nthe silverlight plugin is different on IE8 and Chrome.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 11, 2014 at 6:40 PM, nilesh-shah notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@sambiomatters https://github.com/sambiomatters\nThanks for the reply. We will try the same. However, the same behavior\nworks fine on other browsers (Chrome, FF) and IE latest versions (10,11).\nSo are we saying that, this behavior of plupload, only affects IE9?\nThanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1177#issuecomment-66574297.\n. You could set a negative z index on the component and bring it to the front\nwhen the dialogue opens.\nOn 12/12/2014 11:38 pm, \"Davit Barbakadze\" notifications@github.com wrote:\nSilverlight takes some time to initialize. Might be around 5-10 secs.\nCurrently we simply have to live with this. Or in case you are not\ninterested in client-side image manipulations, you could use minified\nversion, which is smaller in size (much smaller) and initializes instantly.\nYou can find it under bin/ folder in moxie repo\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/tree/master/bin/silverlight.\nBut in general instead of initializing the Plupload on dialog open, I\nwould suggest to initialize it right away and simply call\nuploader.refresh() http://plupload.com/docs/Uploader#refresh--method\nwhen dialog is finally shown. For this to work as expected you will need to\npass a container http://plupload.com/docs/Options#container for\nPlupload in the config manually, let it be some DOM element that doesn't\nget hidden (use document.body as last resort).\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1177#issuecomment-66756893.\n.

I have just tested our live 1.5 plupload with IE8/Silverlight, and, in fact,  it successfully loaded multiple large (40MB) chunked (at 10MB) files simultaneously on both the visible and the invisible tab.\nSo, although you say it can\u2019t work, it actually does, and unfortunately we designed the UI around that.\nIt looks like we may have to stick with 1.5 for the time being.\nJohn\nFrom: Davit Barbakadze [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: 29 September 2014 11:05\nTo: moxiecode/plupload\nCc: John Zangwill\nSubject: Re: [plupload] IE Silverlight crash if second plupload not visible (#1141)\nFlash or Silverlight cannot work if their objects or objects parents are hidden. That's just how these technologies work. I cannot imagine at the moment how they could work in 1.x if you had container option set to something that was invisible at the time of initialisation. I tell you more, if Plupload is uploading something and you hide it, it will stop. In some older browsers it even reinitialized itself. So if you plan to show hide the browse buttons and still want uploads to proceed, you should have Plupload shims out from the container that gets hidden (that's the only working scenario, which is true for both versions 1.x and 2.x, basically because it is not Pluploads constraint, but that of Flash/Silverlight). \nBut when you append Plupload shims to the outer container, there are some additional precautions to take, you should acknowledge that they are absolutely positioned relative to the containers top-left corner and can effectively overlap, if browse buttons have the same absolute position. The task is trivial, you should simply enable/disable corresponding uploader, when the corresponding tab is clicked. But if you do not have control over the tabs and the events that they fire, I do not see how you can make this work, either in 1.x or 2.x.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues/1141#issuecomment-57140250 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/8927258__eyJzY29wZSI6Ik5ld3NpZXM6QmVhY29uIiwiZXhwaXJlcyI6MTcyNzYwNDI4OCwiZGF0YSI6eyJpZCI6NDM4Njg0MDB9fQ==--08d4a9a7c8cddd2acd335029a98401694a60ca1d.gif \n. Davit,\nThe problem is solved by commenting out line 9729 of Moxie.js:\nI.trigger(\"Error\", new x.RuntimeError(x.RuntimeError.NOT_INIT_ERR));\nBoth my uploaders then work perfectly. The invisible one is only \u201cInit\u201ded if the user clicks on its tab, otherwise it doesn\u2019t cause any problems.\nThe problem arises because the Moxie silverlight code is waiting 5 seconds and then checking if the shim has been initialized. In this case the second one hasn\u2019t, because it is currently in an undisplayed div.\nThis is a relief, because at least I now have a workaround, if only by editing the Plupload dev code.\nMay I request that these timeout checks for Flash and Silverlight be made configurable. In any case, they are fatal in a production environment where the client may be running slow for some reason. In my case, no timeout would be long enough, because the second tab is usually not clicked. So I just want to disable the test altogether.\nPlease let me know if there is going to be any chance of getting a production build with the I.initialized tests suppressible.\nThanks,\nJohn\n. May I suggest the following fix, which should deal with all cases without needing special configuration parameters. For both Flash and Silverlight, when I.initialized is checked, check container for visibility:\nif (I && !I.initialized && container.offsetHeight) { // runtime might be already destroyed by this moment\n                    I.trigger(\"Error\", new x.RuntimeError(x.RuntimeError.NOT_INIT_ERR));\n                }\ncontainer.offsetHeight is 0 if it is hidden, and in that case you don't want the error triggering.\nI have tested this on IE8 and 9.\nCheers!\n. Davit, I don't think that your a0bb849 will fix the problem because this happens without SWF being included at all. I actually need the fix I mentioned above (using container.offsetHeight to confirm that the widget had been realized before issuing an error). My company (Halliburton) has just bought an OEM license for 2.1.2, so I would be very grateful if you could include my fix in a release as soon as possible. Thanks, John.\n. ",

Someone in my team solved it and i thought  he had answered you on that thread. Apparently he didn't. All my apologies for the lack of communication, cause i know it was a tricky one ....\nYou  may want to try that case too...\n. Hi there my trick is a dirty one. It works but it's a workaround at best, it's not a fix at all.\n I just bind an event to shown.bs.tab on the twitter bootstrap tab that contains the uploader and i load or reload the uploader during that event. \nApparently on certain devices Pluploader UI doesn't load well if it's hidden at load time. So you need to load it again when it 's visible .....\nHope it helps\n. ",

    "phillmoore": "Hi, yes they are actually chunked. Chunk size is set to 2mb, i'm testing on 17mb files. The 'fails' do not get to upload.php which is very confusing. I.e. a 17mb text file being chunked works perfectly, a 17mb excel/word/zip/pdf etc loads the first chunk in the runtime environment, i.e. shows 12%, but then does not call upload.php. I have tested this by putting a directory write on the first line of upload.php. In all scenarios where it works, the directory gets created, in the fails it does not, so upload.php cannot be being called by the javascript by the looks of things.\n. I would agree, but in that scenario the non chunked uploads of the identical files would also fail, but they do not - that rules out the server env. The upload.php is the latest version straight from the plupload website. I will put up an online example ... thanks for trying to help\n. ok...\nhttp://www.regentaccounting.co.uk/axsdb/dbupload.php\nhttp://www.regentaccounting.co.uk/axsdb/dbupload_chunk.php\nThe only difference between the two urls is '_chunk' has chunking set to 2MB. If you use a non-text file, that is larger than 2MB but less than 20MB (system upload limit).\nIf you submit your file to the first url, it will work.\nIf you submit exactly the same file to the second url, it will fail.\nThe two urls are copies of each other, just with chunk_size added to the second.\n.

    "denzils": "How soon will 3.x be available?\n. Thank you for responding! I'm not sure setting the chunk size to be larger will solve the issue, and I'm not sure I understood your response? Can you elaborate? \n. Will that fix the problem of sending the multiple chunks as a single request? The single request is our main concern. One request for every chunk does not work for our scenario - We are already trying to send large chunk-sizes (25MB) but currently it is sending multiple requests for multiple chunks instead of a single request for multiple chunks. I see in #1347 that Plupload 3.x will bring simultaneous file and chunk uploads and that sending over a single request will be an option. However, it is not clear when Plupload 3.x will be available and I'm not sure the code you provided above is fixing the specific single request issue. Did I misunderstand how the max_retries parameter works? Will Plupload be able to provide us this functionality soon or should we be looking into other modules? Thank you for the quick responses!

My test picture is about 70M, so it will be slow when downloading. This test picture is the original picture of the panorama. Without solving my problem, I can preview normally when I select a small picture and cannot preview when selecting a large picture. Using this address to download pictures might be faster. The server bandwidth I had sent before was too small. If you test, you can download this picture\nhttp://ov4n93l3p.bkt.gdipper.com/image.jpg.
