Will send a PR soon.. Alright, the task is much harder that I thought.\nMy initial idea was to use 32-bit color depth to properly attribute the icon transparency. Here I've replaced ILC_COLOR24 with ILC_COLOR32:\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/3a1d9c401957457f31f0622a4948938c538f9f4d/src/ConEmu/IconList.cpp#L119\nIt worked, look:\n\n(these're PowerShell Core icons; the third image is taken from the PowerShell window without ConEmu for comparison; as you can see, after my patch the icon seems to be pixel-to-pixel perfect)\nBut then I saw the admin icons after my patch:\nBefore:  \nAfter: \n(Yes, that's literally a fully-transparent hole instead of a shield icon).\nI wasn't been able to debug this trouble. Here're my current results:\n1. At this point, the icon seems to be okay (right after the ImageList_Merge):\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/3a1d9c401957457f31f0622a4948938c538f9f4d/src/ConEmu/IconList.cpp#L291\nTo check the generated icon, I've added the following code:\ncpp\nIMAGEINFO ii;\nImageList_GetImageInfo(hAdmList, 0, &ii);\nSaveImageEx(L\"T:\\\\hAdmList.png\", ii.hbmImage);\nSaveImageEx(L\"T:\\\\hAdmList_mask.png\", ii.hbmMask);\nI got the following image:\n\nAnd the following mask:\n\n2. It seems that any further change to hAdmList, not matter if you copy the image to somewhere or just replace it in place (e.g. ImageList_Replace(hAdmList, 0, ii.hbmImage, ii.hbmMask)) will mangle the image. After the replacement the resulting image looks like that:\n\nUnfortunately, (after long debugging sessions) I still have no idea how to fix that \ud83d\ude2d . It seems like the auto-update in ConEmu cannot download this version.. No. It looks like the author actually forgot to upload an installer for a new release. Look, the releases page contains tag for v180309 but doesn't contain the installer file. @Maximus5, could you please upload the installer? Thanks!. ",

Also, I see two other \"hookers\" in your dump. Avecto and NVIDIA. Probably, one of them raise the problem. Can't check Avecto (no trial to download) or NVIDIA (special hardware or drivers).\nI can said that I've never seen ssh trap due several months of git usage. And there was no similar reports yet.\nWell, in the ideal world there must be no traps at all, but at the moment I can't do anything (without more information from you).\n. There is one workaround. You may have \"Injects\" always on, but turn it temporarily off with\nset ConEmuHooks=OFF\nwithin \"git.cmd\" for example.\nUsually I do NOT recommend to turn injects off due to many possible problems, but sometimes this may be an only way...\nI wish to find the problem, of course.\n.

But I believe this is a tcc bug or tcc configuration issue.\nThis issue closed as duplicate.\n. 1. What vim version you are using?\n   1. Link to colorscheme\n   2. Your vimrc (minimalistic)\n   3. Steps to reproduce\n      PS. Googlecode is preferred place for issues.\n.  Even ConEmu version was not specified\n.  Waiting for step-by-step repro.\nLike, run \"vim qqq.cpp\", PgDn 3 times, Up 5 times...\n. 140505\n. Are you interested in minor updates to some translations and text labels?\nYes\nWould you prefer them as individual pull requests or as a large batch of changes?\nThought, individual patches are preferable, because some proposed corrections may be incorrect (misunderstanding).\nAre there other places changes would have to be made?\nFew other places: src\\ConEmu\\About.h and src\\ConEmuCD\\ConsoleHelp.h. ATM there are no l10n support in ConEmu. Thought, english resources will be left in their places.\nMake pull requests for alpha or daily branch, they are most actual for public.\nAlso, you may be interested in wiki pages on googlecode svn\n. That may be if you choose to \"Auto save window size/position\" or \"... opened tabs\" on exit.\n. http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1643\n. Timestamp is (and must) be used to monitoring if the key was changed. The issue is not about timestamps, but about spare updating if the Keys even they was not changed actually.\nAnd this will be \"fixed\" of course.\n. 140905\n. No build number specified.\nAnd I need more detailed, step-by-step description.\n. Weird issue.\nStill doesn't have step-by-step description (can't understand anything from your comments).\nDo you build ConEmu yourself?\nAnd why you are talking about \"/insidewnd\"?\n. So, any step-by-step description?\n. Closed due to non-respond.\n. http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1596\n. Attach test executable.\n. Ideally, with required dependency dll's.\n. 83a4334\n. 5fcf082\n. As I said before, that is not an issue. Storing timestamps separate - will makes them useless! When timestamps are stored inside conemu.xml - you may be sure when you (or ConEmu of course) change certain key. Storing them separate - no consistence, no transact-safe, useless!\nYour actual issue (#10) will be solved (soon may be) when certain key will not be updated if it has no changes.\n. What is about your complain exactly?\n. What is your second screenshot from?\n. Most probably, that is mintty bug/feature/limitation.\n1. Try to run \"notepad.exe\". Does it maximizes correctly?\n2. Does mintty maximizes normally running outside of ConEmu?\n3. Can mintty be resizes by mouse (no maximizing) to the style required to fill ConEmu surface?\n. Closed due to non-respond.\n. @bstoots I never observed such problems with mintty. Even with configs attached above. So, for further examination I need more info: versions, configs, screenshots, more is better.\n. Try build 151025?\n. And how about sourceforge? In fact, binaries are located there. Also, there is codeplex mirror.\n. So, why do you trying to use SF/CP? Use primary mirror http://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html\nI will never add binaries to github, it does not provide \"download\" feature. And I have no desire to increase my git repository with gigabytes of binaries.\n. Try that\nconemu.exe -UpdateSrcSet http://conemu.github.io/version.ini\n. I don't really think that is ConEmu's problem.\nLook, I create the simple \"test.bat\" file\nand start it from explorer window (without DefTerm or any other integrations of course).\npause\n@set path=%~d0\\OpenServer\\modules\\php\\PHP-5.5;%PATH%\ncd /d \"%~dp0\"\nphp.exe non-blocking-stdin.php\ncmd\nThe result - php is blocked on string(16) \"Before get line.\"\nHowever, if I press Enter and type in thit window prompt manually:\nphp.exe non-blocking-stdin.php\nit will return string(7) \"Content\".\n```\nT:\\OpenServer>php.exe non-blocking-stdin.php\nstring(21) \"Before stream select.\"\nstring(20) \"After stream select.\"\nint(1)\nstring(16) \"Before get line.\"\nstring(15) \"After get line.\"\n\"tring(1) \"\nstring(21) \"Before stream select.\"\nstring(20) \"After stream select.\"\nint(1)\nstring(16) \"Before get line.\"\nstring(15) \"After get line.\"\nstring(1) \"\n\"\nstring(21) \"Before stream select.\"\nstring(20) \"After stream select.\"\nint(0)\nstring(7) \"Content\"\nstring(2) \"\n\"\nT:\\OpenServer>cmd\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.2.9200]\n(c) \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0442, 2012. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u044b.\nT:\\OpenServer>php.exe non-blocking-stdin.php\nstring(21) \"Before stream select.\"\nstring(20) \"After stream select.\"\nint(0)\nstring(7) \"Content\"\nstring(0) \"\"\n```\n\n. Well, I've done some changed in 140922.\nAlso, you may check the option \"Skip focus event (don't send to console FOCUS_EVENT...)\".\n. Update to latest alpha before posting new issues\n. Even if your suggestion (with treating coordinates as working area) makes sense for single-monitor station, it becomes totally inconsistent in other configurations. Example on this sketch.\n\nWhat \"coordinates\" will have upper-left corner of ConEmu's window?\nAnyway, update to last alpha first.\n. Build 151015\n.

But I use WinInet API for internet communication and it's required to be \"ConEmu Update\" to be able to process redirections.\nMay be the easiest way ask your proxy admin to add this agent name to allowed list.\n. But on the other hand you may try this build:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3zxoamt5bflijiv/ConEmuC.150225.7z?dl=0\nThe archive contains new ConEmuC.exe and test.cmd which is trying to download two files.\nPlease check and report how they would be downloaded.\n. Open \"test.cmd\". You may find there \"-agent\" switch. Play with its value...\n. build 150716\nNow user may use any external downloader tool if ConEmu's internal does not suite.\n. Of course old builds can't magically acquire new locations of version info! Update manually first!\n. @localpcguy Few versions? Googlecode was deprecated years ago. So you have something wrong in your update settings.\n. @steveoh googlecode died more than a year ago. Of course, the url stored in your xml is not available anymore.\n. @steveoh Show screenshot of the Update settings page\n. @steveoh You are running very old build! And the build itself (dialog title) is cropped on screenshot.\n. ConEmu never overwrites user settings. You may just update manually.\n. 1. googlecode died years ago\n2. Obviously, old builds do not know anything about new locations.\n3. Update manually to the latest preview build and forget about update problems.\nI've said that already several times. Nothing to add. Issue is locked.\n. 6238f0b\n. 1. What is {Git} task?\n2. Try to type \"cmd\" instead of {Git} and press Enter.\n3. Run \"ConEmu -basic\" and try to start cmd by Enter from dialog.\n. 141101 has no changes related to keyboard processing. So I'm quite sure 141029 will behave the same if you try it now.\nBut if it does not happen with -basic switch, you need to find the difference between the default config and yours.\nAt last. That may be an effect of some third-party keyboard hooker.\n. Almost all patches were merged into daily\n. merged into daily\n. What are you trying and what build?\nConEmu comes with many predefined schemes and all you need to do - choose it on Colors page. What can be easier?\nActually, Solarized is set by by default since 141104a\n. BTW, I wonder about your experience with solarized. As for me this palette has too many monotones, so it is not very suitable for use with different apps.\n. 38b4ddb\n. 9ac182d\n. cfb5c32\n. e766cd6\n. c4f25d5\n. Don't click there, that's all )\nActually, that is an effect of \"Change prompt text cursor position\".\n\n. I do that (alt-tabbing) too and do not have problems since option \"Skip click on activation\" was implemented.\n\n. There was no \"Alt-Tab\" in your description. Of course there is no \"activation\" if you have ConEmu already active!\nSo no skip too.\n. 42a95ff\n. At least you need to provide FULL error message!\nAnd show command line its triggered.\n. 1. 140812 is old build\n2. ConEmu.exe really does not have \"/c\" switch.\n   I do not know what are you doing, so...\n   Use ProcessExplorer to understand what's happening.\n. > I made ConEmu the default command line\n\nas provided in the installer.\nWhat do you mean? Installer do not provide that.\n. ConEmu is not a cmd.exe replacement. Did you know the difference between terminal and shell? Read wiki.\nOf course ConEmu.exe does not provide same switches as cmd.exe, terminal is absolutely different program as shell.\nAnd as I've said before Installer do not provide such things as you've described.\nTrying wrong switches causes wrong behavior. Obviously.\n\nYou still haven't described what are you trying to do.\n. Again.\nI've already said ConEmu (neither installer nor application) do not set up any cmd.exe replacement!!\nI do not know what you've setup and you haven't described that.\nHow can I imagine that? I'm not an oracle...\nAnd I already suggests you trying ProcessMonitor.\n. No answer. Will be closed soon.\n. You have not said exactly what you'd set up.\n. It is not broken\n\nHowever, grovbox.vim has some strange errors\n\n. It is not possible.\n. ConEmu uses one set of fonts for all tabs/panes. Separate zooming is not possible yet at least.\n. @postwait You are talking about different features. Changing the window size is not good. Many users are used to large consoles. What would happen when they try to increase font size? Window can't enlarge itself. And what would happen after that when user decrease fontsize? Shall window shrink its size? Shall not? I'm trying to avoid unintuitive behavior. And you are talking about per-pane zoom. What ConEmu would do with other panes if it change the window size? Either font size or cell size would be changed everywhere, which contradicts to the per-pane zoom idea.. 3e4eec2\n. I confirm there are some problems with snapping after restore. In roadmap.\n. But you may\n1) attach your ConEmu.xml\n2) run ConEmu -log, reproduce and attach LogFiles\n. 150203a\n. You have not even specified the version number of ConEmu!\nAnyway if that doctor is trying to use injects - you must do what it is asking if you really need to use it.\n. Old build. But does not matter.\n\nAnyway if that doctor is trying to use injects - you must do what it is asking if you really need to use it.\n\nSo what do you want? You may disable hooks if you need both\nRead wiki http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/ConEmuHk\n. It can. If you disable ConEmuHk as wiki said for DrMem. There is a conflict of course.\n. Mainly that is because \"bugfix patches\" are useless in stable branch.\nMany times it happens, after fixing one problem another appears and that may be not reported immediately.\n. \"Current\" stable branch was locked more that 2 years ago. Of course it will not receive any updates because of too many code changes.\nAt some moment in foreseeable future the stable branch will be shifted to the preview.\nAfter that some patches may (or may not) be merged there.\n. New stable is locked in 150813f. Last version before switching to minhooks.\n. What?\n. You have not even shown ConEmu version. And that is absolutely unclear what do you mean with \"set\" or \"restart\".\n. Read about exporting variables in ConEmu wiki\nI absolutely dislike the idea of \"automatic\" reloading environment from registry!\nEnvironment must be inherited from parent! Always! And that way it goes now.\n. I've just told U. Read wiki about exporting vars.\n. https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/ConEmuEnvironment#Export_variables\n. @TickerOfTime Purpose? And have you read docs? https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuEnvironment.html\n. Self implemented\n. I don't have Win7 jp/cn for playing... Checked with Win 8 - this character is half-width (one cell) without overlapping.\nTry to play with \"Monospace\" option in ConEmu settings\n. (damn touch...)\nWith \"Monospace\" option in ConEmu settings.\nAs for scrolling - ConEmu always shows real console position, unless it was scrolled virtually. Without statusbar you can't see the difference.\nHmm. On superuser.com I've posted description how to put/show prompt at console bottom.\n. In your settings the CJK font is selected. What exactly? Do you think it must be default for CJK systems?\n\"Pseudographics\" font is used for certain range of characters, frames mostly. Exactly: U2013-U25C4. In theory it must not match any CJK ranges.\nIgnore that assertion, not important though.\n141020 is VERY old. Why are you trying it?\n. You are trying old build. Why not to check LATEST? Your problem may be solved already. If not - describe your problem in details.\n. > > Do you think it must be default for CJK systems?\n\n\nsorry, I don't mean this.\nI just mean in CJK systems you must set the font that support CJK.\nI do not understand you. If it must be set, why it must not be default?\n. > Can you tell me how can I setting let me sending a key to ConEmu, the ConEmu don't scroll to the bottom ?\n\n\nI'm not sure what do you mean?\n. You may create a GuiMacro. It can do that without confirmation.\n. What prevents you from \"installing\" ConEmu in your Google drive directory?\nAnyway there is an -loadcfgfile switch.\n. Your patch contains many unclear changes. Compare with that: 3ead3c6\nNext time please do distinct commits for different things.\nAnd do not remove code even commented.\n. Master branch used for \"Preview\" builds.\nDaily - for \"Alpha\".\nSometimes pushes to GitHub may be delayed.\n. No, Master is used for \"Alpha\" builds of course. There was just a delay...\n. Screenshot, build\n. I need screenshots and LogFiles.\nBut it's better to create issues on googlecode.\n. Full log files are much better. Problems with attach? Use DropBox\n. 150302a\n. https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/SettingsAppearance\n. \"Frame width\" of course\n. Set zero\n. \nhttps://gist.github.com/Maximus5/2e83699883922f687874\n. I'm interested in ConEmu.xml you are using.\nAlso, LogFiles are useful, change your command to get them\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\runas.exe /user:domain\\username /savecred \"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" /Log\nUse gist to upload them or some other hoster...\n. I see in logs two tabs in one ConEmu instance. What's the problem?\n. Just add \"-ShowHide\" switch.\n. Can't reproduce.\nLogFiles (reproducing the problem several times by internal hotkey) and ConEmu.xml.\n. 150302a\n. Why not to use DefTerm feature?\n. https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/DefaultTerminal\n. 150302a\n. 150216\n. I wonder, why users are trying to update protected location (ProgramFiles) with 7z package??\n. I mean, how ConEmu appeared first time in ProgramFiles? Yep, you've copied it there manually.\nBut if the installer was used originally - it will be always used for updating. And in that case there will be no problems with elevating/demoting. And then, Windows task sheduler will not be used. And then, it will not show timeouts.\nThe ConEmu task can't start in 20 seconds. Really? That is you've imformed about.\n. If you are using installer for updating - then the sheduler must not be used. Describe all steps with screenshots to understand your situation.\n. Yep. Just now 150216 was released\n. Just drop installer on the ConEmu tab bar\n. What is the \"bunch of dialogs automatically poped up and closed\" like? Is that installer pages or not?\nWhat is your OS?\n. That message is shown by non-interactive instance. So, there is almost no effect with interactive instance.\n. I believe 150224 will fix that\n. 67d4135\n. That is not a ConEmu issue. Report that problem to shell author you are using.\n. Read this wiki: https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/CygwinMsys\nBut your screenshot does not describe the \"behavior\". And there is no information about versions.\n. Actually two or three screenshots would be enough. But of course with StatusBar shown.\n. Advice is simple. Do not do that. Or upgrade to Windows 10.\nConEmu do not support \"virtual\" backscroll buffer.\n. @antogerva Read my previous comment and do not mix issues. If you mean ANSI logs, you should provide write-enabled location for them.\n. Run \"ConEmu -log\", attach LogFiles\n. LogFiles wiki\n. Logs from an year old build? I'm not interested in them.\n. Three more screenshots. I'm interested in \"About\" dialog and your \"Main\" and \"Tabs\" settings (font size especially).\n. What you have configured, what is expected and what is the current result?\n. I have the same questions.\n. Of course they were not answered, so I was asking.\n\"New\" and \"Startup\" are different essenses.\nMoreover, you are talking about \"ConEmu here\", that is third setting.\nResume: configure ConEmu properly. Previous behavior was wrong.\n. Again.\nYou've misunderstood options meaning.\n\"Default task for new console\" tells ConEmu to use that task when user press [+] button or corresponding keyboard shortcut. Only!\nStartup task may be chosen on Startup setting page. As its name says...\n. One more thing. ConEmu can create many \"Here\" items. So specifying exact command is highly preferred to avoid inconsistency...\n. How it can make sense? User have to specify \"Startup\" command/task. The \"Default task\" was not designed to be used as \"Startup\" task. Moreover, user can choose to Autosave/restore opened tabs!\n. @glen-84\nThat is strange. -cur_console must be processed before passing to PowerShell... seems like a bug.\n@kdelmonte\nsh.exe --login -i\", no?\n. cmd.exe is superfluous for git bash. Moreover it can be harmful in some cases.\n. No. Quotations are allowed here.\n. 150305\n. @Briahas\nCan't reproduce that. Send your ConEmuXml via gist. And, may be, describe steps to get the problem more thoroughly.\n. Unbelievable. How` has got into itself contents? What had you done exactly?\n. Edit your xml manually. I believe it's impossible to get such situation in current build, so there is nothing to fix. It's already fixed.\nConEmu can't \"imagine\" what was in your xml before it was broken.\nPS. xml or registry - doesn't matter.\n. Actually, the easiest way is to run\nConEmu.exe -detached\n. Nope. Wait a bit...\n. I see now. There is a conflict with \"Minimize on closing last tab\".\n. Update to latest build.\n. 150305\n. But \"two Git bash tasks\" is a bug too I think. Regardless of their minor difference in environment vars usage.\n. Still broken? Latest version?\nConEmu do not and will never do \"patching\" tasks contents created before.\nIf anyone wants to \"recreate\" default tasks he may erase old ones and press button \"Create default tasks\".\n. As for your git tasks you can simply quote program path.\n. What do you mean?\n. @gene-pavlovsky Just look carefully in your configuration dialog.\n. You shall read description for tab temlate field! %d is not a template you are looking for.\n. The screenshot shows template for \"directory path\", what was requested.\nIs it so hard to read description near to the template field to get %f - folder?\n. Screenshot was not posted by me and I tried to force you to check your settings dialog.\nWithout thorough information about OS, shell, prompt configuration, ConEmu version and probably something else I can't find your problem with jammed folder in title.\n. I suppose, you may correct PROMPT_COMMAND and suggest an improvement.\nAnyway, I hate /cygdrive.\n. Empty string would revert to default tab title.\n. @gpressutto5 RTFM: Shell working directory. 150307a\n. Read wiki about ChildGui\nhttps://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/ChildGui\nConEmu do not control their internals. That's why switch is not working.\nSolution - do not use mintty.\n. If you run zsh in ConEmu (but not in ConEmu/mintty) the answer differs\ncygwin has completely changed process spawning. So when you type \"-new_console\" it do not pass to ConEmu processing routines.\nBut you still can use the switch\nConEmuC -c zsh -new_console\nThat will do the trick.\nMay be you can create some processing script in zsh profile to add prefix \"ConEmuC -c \" if -new_console exists in executing command. But I'm not sure how.\n. What's the problem? Use -new_console:t:...\n. Win-Alt-A, -new_console\nAs for new console dialog - I like to left it minimal. There are dozen of possible options. No sense to add them all.\nAt last, it's recommended to use tasks for most used shells and switches. I all other cases I believe it's not a problem to run tab with switch or rename it after creation.\n. That was bad implementation.\na7df3bd\n. Why your patch is \"dirty\"\n1. Calling psapi for each wheel event is a large overhead, especially taking in account that the name of active process is constantly stored in RCon member string variable.\n2. Fixed comparison with \"vim.exe\" is bad because there can be another xterm-aware applications.\n3. Fixed F6/F7 are bad because they seize real keys. Xterm-like ESC sequences are much better. Moreover you may find xterm  suggested sequences for that exact case.\nAnd. Have you noticed weird letters at the end of my previous comment?\na7df3bd\nThat was commit hash of implemented feature.\n. There are many English comments in the code.\n. The wiki contains examples for zenburn color scheme.\n. Two questions or one actually?\nI do not accept an idea of skipping UAC confirmation.\nUser must know what he is going to run in an elevated context.\nIf you want no UAC confirmations - just run ConEmu elevated.\n. Moreover, implementation of UAC confirmation skipping will cause security breach - any harmful script can be run almost silently.\n. Well, I'll read your messages again later. But:\n1. When you run new tab it is spawned using ConEmu as parent process. Otherwise you'll get broken trees at last. Don't remember ATM if it is true for elevated processes but I think so.\n2. When you add -new_console:a that tells ConEmu to raise UAC dialog. And user may be able to enter different credentials there.\nWhat do you want to get at last? Spawn multiple elevated consoles from existing one? You may do that without -new_console switch I think.\n. Not quite sure what you want to achieve at last. Thought you can run your elevated tabs from task sheduler. Here is an example for simple \"cmd\" tab.\nC:\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\ConEmuC.exe /ASYNC /C C:\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\ConEmuC.exe /ATTACH /ROOT cmd\nSupposing ConEmu was installed in C:\\ConEmu.\nAlso, if ConEmu GUI was not started it will be started elevated.\n. I do not maintain chocolatey packages.\nConEmu has internal auto-update feature.\n. I believe /ASYNC is mentioned in first line of ConEmuC /?\nAll that information is shown in Win-Alt-A too.\nThe distinction is obvious and simple - ConEmuC is console part of ConEmu. This project provide full console WinApi support unlike mintty and clones.\n. \"-async Y/N\" is used with and after \"-download\" only.\n/Async switch is used only with /c, and /c is absolutely the same as in cmd.exe.\nSo I think it's clear what /Async is doing. cmd.exe can run commands only synchronously. Also, /Fork switch is an alias of /Async here.\n/ATTACH switch is described in switches section. It is used with /ROOT in my example.\nDo you have any suggestions of text improvements? Welcome\n. Actually, I'm going to move all information to http://conemu.github.io and http://www.conemu.ru\n. @SamHasler What for? There is documentation only. Commenting pages?\n. Done\n. Global hotkey? That is not friendly to seize one more. Moreover the feature will be inaccessible when several ConEmu windows are opened.\nI think much better usecase will be\n1. Change path in explorer\n2. Switch to exact ConEmu instance\n3. Press hotkey\nHowever, I do not think that suggested feature is so useful. It's possible to click in explorer window path bar, Ctrl-C and then paste in ConEmu cnd line... No?\n. Hotkey \"Paste path from clipboard in unix format\" exists already. And I think it's more universal - you can get path into clipboard from anywhere, not only from Explorer window.\n. You have not tried my suggestion?\n. There is no need to keep window tracking.\nFunction FindWindowEx perfectly do window enumeration in Z-order. Just find first Explorer window below ConEmu.\nActually my main objection is global hotkey using.\nAbout places - DoCdExplorerPath must be in CRealConsole, and getFocused...Path in ConEmuApp.cpp\n. Why?\nWhen you have foreground Explorer you do not see ConEmu window. And there can be more than one ConEmu instance as I said before. What instance must grab that path? Unpredictable behavior I believe.\nBut if you switch to exact ConEmu instance - there will be no such problems.\n. OK, you've persuaded me.\nWith some corrections - 68f51f0\n. Actually no one has yet convinced me that DirectWrite rendering is better that ClearType. There was no screenshots with comparison of drawing methods.\nAt the moment I think this is only prejudice.\n. That is not proper comparison. I suppose these are screenshots of Sublime?\nYou need to compare with ConEmu. Well, I do not have \"Helvetica Monospaced\" files, so here is \"Liberation Mono\" 18. Drawbacks? Do not see them.\n\n. That is only your supposition. As I've said, proper comparison will be between DirectWrite in Sublime and ClearType in ConEmu.\n. Large amount of code have to be refactored. I've already done part of the job but there is much to do yet.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#direct-write\n. Trolling?\n. Yep, may be...\n. Second screenshot is clear-type one. From ConEmu.\nBTW, clear-type have many user chosen options and obviously depends on your computer configuration. So it may differ from PC to PC...\n. I've already agreed that DirectWrite may be nice.\nBut! It support requires a lot of coding, especially to be able to use both techniques. Of course I will not break GDI support.\nWell, I have internal branch were the work was started, but there are other urgent issues.\n. \"Threat font height as device units\". Checked - pt, unchecked - px. Complains? Perhaps to font authors or Microsoft.\n. There is also \"dpi\" checkbox.\n. OK, these are not \"pt\", but \"device units\" as described in CreateFont function.\n. d9758a9\n. So, what's the problem?\nConEmu -?\n-loadcfgfile\n. Actually, ConEmu distro is small enough to hold all its files (binaries, docs, settings) in DropBox.\n. Implemented long time ago\n. Windows' tabs WinApi control is customizable on system (OS) level only.\n. May be in the future I will switch to the owner-draw tabs implementation.\n. And where are crash dumps?\n. BTW, I have ConEmu with opened tabs running for days (weeks sometimes) without problem.\n. So, why do you think that ConEmu was crashed??\nIf you have no crash message that means that your shell was exited.\nYou may run ConEmu with \"-log\" switch, that it will log your shell exit codes.\n. I need crash dump.\nUsually ConEmu created it automatically unless something was going bad bad way or some third-party tool disallows that creation.\n. Also. Consoles can't go away actually. They are still running and in most cases will be shown automatically.\nTry to kill the ConEmu.exe process (but not the task) to see that behavior.\n. ConEmu shows crash message and says where it was created.\nIn most cases it will be on your desktop.\n. Screenshots, logs, dumps...\n. Almost useless... especially due to huge recursion of exception handlers.\nBut your words about restoring VM let me thinking about a bug in wininet.dll.\n. Don't need them.\nInternet code refactoring is in progress.\n. All internet-releated code was moved to ConEmuC.exe long time ago. Also, it's possible to use external downloader tools like curl or wget.\n. Your suggestions?\n. I've played with \"Project moved\" in googlecode metadata, but rolled it back. The site will be totally closed, that is too early.\nI wonder, can you access googlecode by https now?\nhttps://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5\n. Done\n. THIS SCRIPT WILL SEND A LOT OF EMAILS TO ALL WATCHERS\nThousands of emails is not what my users will like.\n. But I'll try to create another repository for issues history\n. New build was not released yet\nd355772\n. They are incompatible.\n. It's absolutely crazy to trying to hook CONSOLE applications which do not drawing at all.\nContact with MacType authors, not me.\nWorkaround is to add ConEmuC.exe and ConEmuC64.exe to MacType's exclusions.\n. Screenshot of RealConsole - CtrlWinAltSpace.\nFar profile settings (may be colors.db will be enough).\n. Misunderstand your first complain.\n. First image has two parts. Upper is OK?\nEMail is ok.\n. 160207?\n. You must not remember shortcuts. You can choose your own!\nBTW, they are not bizarre.\nAnd what menu do you want to show?\n. No way. Simple keypresses are passed to console unmodified.\nYou may set Alt+Space - general Windows hotkey, if you can't remember a hotkey with Win.\nSystemMenu can be accessed by many ways\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SystemMenu.html\n. > Then why can I assign to non-modifier keys\n\nand it eats them completely?\nAssign what exactly? Where? Who eats?\nassign to the menu or alt keys, both of which\nare natural and intuitive menu keys?\nConEmu is terminal, it is not a Notepad, Word or any other standalone GUI application.\nIt does not and must not eat keys.\nIt redirect keypresses into console applications input queue.\nDo you expect mstsc.exe to eat Alt key to show menu? I believe not. That will be weird behavior. Same with ConEmu.\n. You have not shown an example.\n. That is user choice.\n. BTW, Apps key is allowed now.\n. VK_APPS\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/AppsKey.html\n. Update your cygwin installation.\n\nAnd read docs:\nhttp://ConEmu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. You can do this yourself in the shell command.\n. And \"Here\" is working even without pushd. Even with plain cmd.\n\n\n\nAs I've said, you can add pushd to your \"Command\" field. ConEmu will not do that \"automatically\" because anyone can set up any shell he wants to run with \"Here\" feature.\nPS. \"Configuration = HereTest\" was for testing purposes. Doesn't matter actually.\n. 1. That will totally blocks googlecode site and actual issues will be inaccessible\n2. Button \"export to github\" do not work at all. It says \"too many issues\"\n3. All wiki pages already moved to http://ConEmu.GitHub.io/en/TableOfContents.html\nHave tried some third-party script for moving issues to /ConEmu/old-issues project but it sucks - stucked on somewhat more than a thousand of issues. Going to create my own exporter but it will take time.\nAt last. Old issues can't be imported into /Maximus5/ConEmu because that will generate thousands of emails for watchers.\n. Yep, unfortunately. And I don't want to send massive spam to my watchers.\n. There is an option to export all googlecode data to json and import issues to github with another google's python tool.\nBut we can't do import into this exact project because this will generate huge amount of emails sent to project watchers, AFAIK there is no option to do \"silent\" import.\nAs an option, we can import issues to another project (https://github.com/ConEmu/old-issues/issues) but I'm still investigating the options. Will created issues have save ID as on googlecode? Especially taking into account the fact that some issues were completely deleted on googlecode, so there are gaps in ID numbers.\n. Your note doesn't contain exact information. Can't understand your problem.\n. I need to check this.\nBut if you untick \"Save size & pos\" on exit you will always get maximized window.\nI can't imagine at what moment your window is restored, but after that ConEmu saves normal position, exactly as settings said.\n. I just checked and when re-opened the window was maximized. What I'm doing wrong?\nWithout thorough step-by-step description what exactly you are doing I can't help.\n. Github do not accept attachments. Use DropBox or Gist.\n. Quake mode do not support maximized mode.\n. Merged into gh-304\n. 1. Screenshots\n2. Try KiTTY\n3. PuTTY is GUI application, ConEmu don't control what it paints on it own canvas.\n. What shall I do to reproduce the problem on my local PC?\nAfter gray rectangle appears, press CtrlWinAltSpace. PuTTY window must appears. How it will be?\nAlso, I'm interested in LogFiles\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\nReproduce gray rectangle and send me them.\n. When ConEmu switches tab it hides its own child windows representing that console.\nPuTTY, in turn, is a child of ConEmu child window, so it hides automatically.\nShow back works in the same manner.\n. What?\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFarPlugin.html#ConEmu\n. 1. Screenshot of Settings\\Info\n2. Screenshot of Settings\\Tabs\n. Same as https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1885\n. I've done some tests. First \"broken\" version was 141201. And I can't just revert the commit but need rewrite some stuff.\n. Have you tried latest alpha?\n. I need at least exact steps and settings to reproduce that.\n. Randomness is bad...\nWell, than I need the following\n1. OS and user details (admin/non-admin, one user per all processes or some were elevated for example, something else may be...)\n2. Screenshot of your DefTerm settings or the whole xml file.\n3. Details about the moment the problem appears next time:\n- Take a look at process three (in ProcessExplorer) to determine if all PIDs are alive and the fact if ConEmuHk*.dll is loaded in all mentioned processes. Make screenshot of process tree with PIDs visible.\n- If possible, I wish to get MemoryDumps of ConEmuC and the process in which ConEmuHk was failed to be injected.\nAlso, do you use \"Aggressive mode\"? Try to disable it.\n. What's about latest preview?\n. Same as #96\nAlso: https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1885\n. Both issues are related to DefTerm feature.\nWhen smth is started from VS the process is started \"suspended\".\nAt that moment it's impossible to call CreateToolhelp32Snapshot on it.\n. @headsphere Because this issue is duplicate. As mentioned above. Anyway, without exact description what type of application you try to debug nobody can suggest what happens on your side. DefTerm is expected to be working.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/KeyboardShortcuts.html\nWin+Q, console alternative plink.exe, mouse, hotkey to put focus into ConEmu directly.\n. At the first look I do not think that this can be controlled by ConEmu.\n. But how exactly have you changed default ConEmu icon?\n. And what about \"Close confirmation\" dialog?\n. \u0418 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0443\u0448\u043d\u0430\u044f )\n\u041f\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e.\n. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430.\n\u0412 \u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430, \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e alt-tab.\n.

All GuiMacro are executed in GUI.\nConnection needs time.\n. ConEmu is terminal.\nIt is not a TaskBar replacement and will never be.\nDeveloping full replacement of TaskBar, API, COM interfaces and other stuff costs hundreds of hours of developing and investigating. And megabytes of code.\nNope, thanks, don't mix absolutely different purposes. Terminal must be a terminal.\n. Anyway.\nConEmu is responsible for application you run inside it.\nThese applications are shown as tabs with their icons.\nTerminal must not manage outside windows.\n. Big TabBar == big ToolBar. Otherwise it will be ugly and almost inaccessible.\nThat is HighDpi support.\n. What?\n. A lot of builds passed. How about latest preview?\n. Merge: gh-1414. ConEmu do not create tasks when user have any tasks already created.\nBut there is Add default tasks button on the Tasks page\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTasks.html\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\nThere are millions of programs. No sense to name \"working\" or \"not working\".\nAs about the bug - you have to report it thoroughly, with screenshots and reproducing steps.\n. Yes\n. v15.05.04\n. That's a crazy quotation issue. Following works\nsubprocess.call(['ConEmu.exe', '/cmd', '{Git', 'Bash}']);\n. Never seen that. I need exact reproducing steps to find the problem.\nBut I don't believe it depends of other started tabs.\n. I believe start doesn't matter.\nIt must behave same way if you run cmd tab from ConEmu \"New console dialog\" or just a task.\n. I need LogFiles created while tgh fails\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. You have MacType hooker. Not a ConEmu problem.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Installation.html#mactype\n. Do not see any example\n. At the moment I have not idea how to do this in elegant way.\nMay be using of environment variables is a workaround?\n. Show me an example of your vision (how it must be stored in the xml file)\n. Do not think that encrypting whole config is either proper or handy. Hey, that will be binary file but not an xml at last.\nSensitive data can be in tasks commands and the history commands. Only these string must be encoded. Plus settings page \"Encryption\".\n. It may be workaround but ugly. Because it will create second (even temporary) tab which will start expected one...\n. If it was really working (doubt) then by mistake only.\nDocumentation says absolutely clear that it is wrong usage:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html\nSwitch MUST be specified AFTER \"/cmd\" but not before.\n. Two more things.\n1. Switch was just ignored in previous versions.\n2. It's recommended to set up \"ConEmu here\" from ConEmu interface itself.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsIntegration.html\n. BTW, have you run \"ConEmu -?\"\n. Got it. Will add some clarifications.\n. Try this patch\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sd0q14ikak36hjw/ConEmuHk.150420a.dll.7z?dl=0\n. Unbelievable. It's working properly.\nJust unpacked ConEmuPack.150420.7z, Far30b4351.x86.20150421.7z, created new ConEmu and Far profiles and set up association.\n\n\n. Your screenshot do not look like default profiles I mentioned. You have to run both ConEmu and Far to check the issue.\n. Why do people like symlinks so much...\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Whats_New.html#Build_150408\n. Neither of your screenshots shows fonts or colors.\n. ConEmu acts exactly as you've configured it.\nYour startup task is {Shells::cmd (Admin)},\nbut you've set bare cmd in you \"ConEmu Here\" command.\nPut the same in both places and you will get same result.\n. How about latest preview?\n. Did you abandon ConEmu? It's a pity.\n. No screenshots were provided.\n. 1. 150209 is OldBuild. Why do you report it?\n2. What vim.exe you are running? Origin.\n. Why do you report it here?\nThis is an MSys bug/feature.\nFew links\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\nTERM, mintty, bash...\n. Yep, exactly as I've mentioned above...\nAs far as I remember clear's behavior depends on TERM environment variable.\n. Use latest ConEmu. Use default task for git-for-windows. Profit.. Without screenshots I can only suppose that this is gvim problem. More info here: http://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\nAll contribution options are described here: http://conemu.github.io/donate.html\nEven paypal is supported\n. - https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/vim_dev/3LhQNPrXz64\n- http://superuser.com/a/972044/139371\n- https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/430\n. 1. What is \"ls\"? If it is Cygwin or MSys binary - address you question to their manuals and authors. http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n2. ConEmu is unicode from the birth. All possible issues are related to running apps but not ConEmu. http://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\nAt last. cmder is third-party bundle able to bring its own bugs. I don't abuse it but that is a real possibility.\n. Try MSys2 by the way\n. What is your question about? Run vim and edit your file\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n. 160207?\n. Why do you ask here how to use Total Commander??\n. @eugenesvk \nYou may check conemu-inside project.\nThis is an example, how ConEmu may be started as child window in any application.\n. 1. It would be better to ask TotalCmd author, no? At the moment I don't have plans to implement TCMD plugins.\n2. I have absolutely no idea why your OS is buggy. Also, I have no idea what OS you are using.\n. The Inside mode is described in docs. As I said before, at the moment I don't want to pay my time to develop TC plugin, but if TC can provide the \"space\" for terminal, or there are existing plugins which may do that, you may run ConEmu inside TC easily. Obviously, I don't know if that is possible and you shall to ask TC authors.\n\nAfter trying to attache to explorer.exe\n\nWhat???\n. Awful...\nWhy do you think that ConEmu requires slash-arguments? Posted link to docs describes both modes: Explorer and arbitrary HWND. Project conemu-inside is the example how developer may utilize second mode.\nAs for yourquestions\nHow do you imagine these suggestions? HWND is strict and unambiguous option, and this value knows the parent application, and they often provide some macros to acquire the value. Obviously only their authors may advise you about.\nAll other \"options\" to determine available space are ambiguous and they would be broken on minimal configuration changes in parent layout. That is not acceptable.\n. Run far /w\n. There is no sense in duplicating the information. ConEmu shows in the title the console title which obviously may differ from tab title.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/TabVsTitle.html\nBut if you want to lose that info or automate your work with AHK - just rename the tab.\n. I don't remember my thoughts about this.\nNow I can't understand how the window-caption=tab-caption may help to automate things with AHK. Usually the -title switch is enough to identity ConEmu window.. Merged: gh-497\n. You misunderstand meaning of checkbox.\nRun or run not msiexec as admin. Nothing else.\nmsi itself requires elevation.\n. Why do you talking about {cmd} task? It is not used in your batches.\nRunning ConEmuPortable.exe implies activation of active instance. Do you really need that? Have strong doubt...\nUse http://ConEmu.GitHub.io/en/NewConsole.html\n. Posted wiki page shows proper usage of -new_console switch. Why do you still run ConEmu.exe?\ntimeout /T 5\u00ad\ncmd /c test2.bat -new_console:b\n. Indeed\n. Not sure what do you mean. Close ConEmu?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/GuiMacro.html\n. Original issue was fixed in build 150504\n. - http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/VimXterm.html\n. Can't confirm that. Attach via gist your ConEmuXml and show step-by-step screenshots.\n. I have many issues to deal with.\nAnd I do not see the screenshots I've asked you about.\n. Will try today\n. Just retried your config. I don't observe any problems with width and height restoration.\nSo I'm waiting for screenshots.\nAnd I need log files recorded during problem repro:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. Still obscured.\nI hope I will release new alpha today. Please check it and redo logs if the problem will persist.\n. Damn! Your taskbar is auto-hidden. That's why I always claim screenshots at first.\n. \"Color/inverse\" option is implied when cursor size is greater or equal to 40% of the cell. By design.\n. Just forgotten about that pull request. Next time you may post smth in pull to remind me.\n. 1. How do you do that?\n2. May be there is not enough permissions. What do you suggest in that case? Error message is related to DefTerm feature.\n. What is the sense of the issue?\nAnyone may use any editor he prefers. My personal favorite is Far Manager which is highly customizable, support true-color schemes, has powerful syntax colorization with source outlining, and much more.\nMany users prefer vim by their unux experience. And of course notepad++ and Sublime text.\nAll these editors and managers are live projects.\n. I see. Actually there are thousands of well written console applications. And many GUI application works well in ConEmu too.\n. > global shortcuts were working just fine some weeks ago..\n\nDo not think so... Show me the build which was working before\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/?source=directory\n. Just checked, and I don't see any problem with WinAmp+ConEmu+Play (multimedia key on my keyboard). So\n- Try to run ConEmu -basic -cmd cmd to check if the issue persists.\n- Try to define exact software+configs to reproduce that on other PC (I have to check it on my side).\n- Also, may be LogFiles and KeyEvents would give me some idea.\n. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/134#issuecomment-100581755\n. I'm using ShareX for making screenshots. No problems with PrtScr and combos.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html#Screenshot\n. If you run any application under Administrator I believe you'll get same behavior.\n\nObviously, if you have some elevated application, others with lower privileges can not capture input from higher privileged application.\nConEmu do not filter any global keyboard shortcuts, with exception, of course, those defined in Settings/Keyboard.\nPersonally, I never run the ConEmu under Admin. I prefer have non-elevated GUI to have ability to run both elevated and non-elevated shells.\n. ShareX has option to not to include cursor image on screenshot. I remove cursor from screen before capture.\n. Due to another Microsoft bug (not described in that page yet) it's not possible.\n. Impossible yet.\n. @GarethOates I'm surprised you failed to look above your comment. The feature exists.\n\n. Show your screenshots\n. What ssh version you are using? There are many different distros.\nAnyway I believe that is a ssh problem which must be fixed in their layer.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nConEmu send mouse events to console input buffer in standard way and well written console applications process them perfectly.\n. cmd.exe do not use mouse at all. What for? It's a shell.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinAnsi.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Delusions.html\n. Quake? Show your settings.\nAnyway, I do not think there may be reasonable solution. Focus is given to ConEmu by Windows. No way to determine \"origin\" of GetFocus event.\n. ConEmu may be shown in TaskBar, either as \"button\" or in the status area.\nWhen user clicks the icon - ConEmu have to be shown.\nObviously there was no global hotkey pressed.\nObjections?\n. I will think about an option.\nYou forget about an icon in TaskBar status area. It's clickable too.\n. Agree\n. 150513\n. @robmsmt Didn't understand your question. 322f2b9\n. mpv? Is it either a [console application]( http://conemu.github.io/en/ConsoleApplication.html]?\n. Show screenshots\n. Docs page http://conemu.github.io/en/DefaultTerminal.html clearly says that you have to add \"parent\" application to the hooked executable list. Firefox but not mpv!\n. ConEmu version?\nWindows version?\nSettings?\n. 150513\n. 150513\n. 8eb72d75. I prefer separate issues in most cases.\n. 04625b3\n. Either animation or access speed.\n. Animation is done by Windows API.\n. I don't see either problem with animation.\nUnless you explain exactly what do you suggest or dislike there is nothing to fix.\n. What do you mean? They can't be \"not running\"...\n. I misunderstand you. What do you mean by \"wait\"?\n. * Animation is processed by Windows\n Window \"captures\" visual representation of the animated window before animation and obviously it is not updated during animation\n But that does not means that \"applications were stopped\" - they continue to run and run and run. Read docs!\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsStartup.html\n. > Can I specify tasks that also run a set of commands, each from a separate console/tab? \nYou already do that. You run two tabs.\nIf you need to run script instead of CLI, use bash -c ... switch, but that is not a question about tasks or ConEmu.\nBut you may find this informative:\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartCmd.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartDir.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n\n. ConEmu is able to embed anywhere.\nHowever docs page is not fully translated yet.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/InsideParent.html\n. @devmondo what?\n. Wrong place to ask! Fill a request to WebStorm authors. ConEmu can be easily run embedded as I've said before.\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/InsideParent.html\n- https://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-inside\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConEmu.Control.WinForms/\n. @tyler36 Are you WebStorm author? Have you prepared WebStorm to start ConEmu embeddable? I do not think so.\nAll required information exists in docs, I've posted above.\nIn brief, obviously, the switch -insidepid that was developed for Explorer would never work in WebStorm. And if you do not provide exact child window descriptor that ConEmu may utilize for covering its whole area, embedding feature would not be working.\nAnyway, I can't understand why anyone has problems with ConEmu as external terminal. ConEmu able to bring it to top automatically.\n. Just have installed and checked WebStorm.\nVerdict\nWithout support from WS authors you'll never get neat terminal integration.\nTechInfo\nWS has only one (main) HWND, no children windows for layout/panes. So ConEmu has no chance to acquire proper coordinates of the area it have to cover.\nEven if you specify the coordinates if the area, you would get various glitches like two blinking carets or weird behavior of WS' terminal pane resizing.\nContact JetBrains!\n. Please ask there: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-140298\n. There are no proper terminals which can do this weird thing. For many reasons.\nBut you may read this doc:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/PromptAtTheBottom.html\n. Also. http://conemu.github.io/en/FarManager.html\n. I strongly dislike the idea.\n1. ConEmu is a terminal with almost minimalistic interface.\n2. Suggested \"input field\" is useless with huge amount of console applications. With editors like Vim for example.\n3. This field will break habitual terminal experience.\n4. It will not integrate with input controlled by console application. There are thousands of them, how do you think ConEmu may do Tab completion for example?\nBTW. I know only one \"terminal\" and only for Windows which provides such input field. It's awful IMHO.\n. One more thing. Separating contexts is unhandy idea... Have you ever seen the IDE where you type editing texts outside of main document context?\nWell, there are thousands of IDEs, editors and other tools, but I don't know ones with such concept.\nAt last. This may be not obvious, but Terminal is not a program which get some text line (as command) from user and evaluates its content. Command line interpreters do that. But CLI is only a small part or console applications class.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/TerminalVsShell.html\n. It is practically impossible to update ConEmu binaries within ConEmu session. Even detaching consoles will not behave properly because of http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html\nConEmu has its own auto update procedure which consider all issues.\nBut with chocolatey... Hmm. I'm not sure if it's possible at the moment. Update must be started outside of ConEmu window somehow.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/DefaultTerminal.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html\n. Detach is possible but several dll-s will remain loaded in started processes.\n. FreeLibrary may kill process in some cases.\nPending moves will work only on reboot. That is unwanted behavior I believe.\nAnyway, the issue is complicated and requires some investigations...\n. Only the one session may survive after choco update. Regardless of that, you should restart the console manually after update.\nThat is due to protocol changes between versions and other issues.\nChoco update script warns user about that.. In my tests ConEmu didn't crash on update from choco tab, started in ConEmu of course.. First dump.. I don't think that these changes must be globally available. Anyone may enable the option locally.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html\n. I haven't checked this verb implementation in PowerShell but in the past I bumped into the weird thing that some API calls are too deep in the kernel to be hooked at all.\nOK, I will check this later... Now you may modify your PowerShell profile to attach these free consoles into ConEmu window if it exists.\n. Press Ctrl-Win-Alt-Space to check the RealConsole. Seems like you have different background color index set in the RealConsole properties. Either it may be overrided by profile or start switches.\n. There is a large difference between console color indexes (which ConEmu utilizes) and RealConsole colors (or color palette) because ConEmu has its own palette.\n. And what? Configure \"Right\" action if you dislike default behavior, which is handy I believe.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsControls.html\n. If you do know how to check if connection is metered - tell me.\n. When you close \"Update window\" by Cancel clicking I think ConEmu will not ask you about updating till next version.\n. Just checked. ConEmu do not ask twice about same build. Even if \"Hourly\" is checked.\n. That is intended behavior. Cross is not equal to Cancel.\n. Problem has gone away?\n. I prefere strict code. More, in some places you can see _ASSERT\n. Impossible yet.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#tab-theming\n. So you are talking about active Split but Tab? Change Fade values.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsColors.html\n. I still do not know how are you trying to move the window.\nAnd without your full config (at least screenshots of Size and Appearance pages) I can't tell you more.\n. Anyway, I consider that is a bug. ConEmu must jump to another monitor when the mouse cursor reaches it.\n. Another workaround is to set manually X coordinate on the Size/Pos settings page and press apply.\n. @admsteck There is Minimize/Restore hotkey, isn't it? Move the mouse to desired monitor and press these keys.\n. @admsteck You may try following GuiMacro\nSetOption(\"Check\",2333,0); WindowMode(\"MNEXT\"); SetOption(\"Check\",2333,1);\n. > I've disabled the keyboard hooks and also unassigned the hotkeys for win+shift+right/left and it still does nothing while in quake mode.\nWindows' bugs must be reported to Microsoft, don't they?\n. @chickerson Hmm? Seems like Windows move window to newly attached monitor.\n. Horizontal scrolling is already in RoadMap.\n. Merged: gh-1031. Attach screenshots and tell us what shell you are using.\n. Seems like your shell is not recognized by ConEmu. You haven't posted a screenshot so I can't be sure.\n. Also Sync dir is not saved by design. It may harm user experience when the directory in the console is used for some operation.\n. User have not type \"cd \\1\\n\" actually. There is a Sync column in the StatusBar. Just click it after start and ConEmu will choose \"cd\" command automatically.\n\n. Attach your settings\nhttp://ConEmu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html\n. I can't know what have you registered as \"Here\" and \"Inside\" commands. They are stored in the Windows registry, but not in the xml file.\nAnd I do not observe any color differences in my tests.\n\nWithout step-by-step screenshots I can't say more.\n. No answer. Closed\n. I've given the same recommendation in June. For several months there were no answer.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/170#issuecomment-113277439\n. Try this patch\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/908b9iwe0bs69hb/ConEmu.150513a.exe.7z?dl=0\n. 150608.\nHave you even try to open settings dialog? Go to the Confirmation page.\n. You show just a message but not the settings page.\n. Moreover. By your screenshots I see you are still using old and unpatched build!\n. There is no \"lowest line\" term defined in Windows. Even if the cursor was left on some line, console applications may write below it using standard WinApi.\nMore cons than pros.\nWill not implement that.\n. There is an example for cmd:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/PromptAtTheBottom.html\n. Update and read whats new (Dynamic scrollbar range).\nThere is even the hotkey to position your buffer at the line with the cursor.\n\n. What?\n. So? Detach tab and attach it into another ConEmu instance.\nThere is no \"one-command\" menu item at the moment.\n. Weird. That's a bug.\n. What is running in tabs? How do you do the paste?\n. I do not see any problems with paste using actual versions.. Is not reproduced. Run:\nConEmu -basic -cmd {Far}\nTry Alt+F9\n. Most probably you have not ConEmu's plugins loaded.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFarPlugin.html\n. Show your config\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html\nAnd how exactly you run Far.\n. That is strange. I've failed to reproduce the problem on your config attached before.\n. Calling cmd.exe before bash is absolutely excessive. Look how ConEmu creates default tasks when you run ConEmu.exe -basic.\nAlso, there was an issue in git-for-windows\nhttps://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/96#issuecomment-106048871\n. I haven't decided yet which behavior or switches would be correct for running git-bash.exe. This tool is compiled as GUI application but it starts console window, may be improperly. Perhaps I will create pull request for git-for-windows later.\n. Preferred way to run git-for-windows is using git-cmd.exe\nc:\\git\\git-cmd.exe --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i\n. Here is my test case, without java of course. It do not crash. Also it neither does attach wscript.exe and its descendants into ConEmu nor injects ConEmuHk into these processes.\nDim WinScriptHost, serverOur, ArgumentsString\nSet objFSO = Wscript.CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\nSet WinScriptHost = WScript.CreateObject(\"WScript.shell\")\nserverOur = objFSO.GetTempName\nArgumentsString = \"cmd.exe\"\nWinScriptHost.Run \"cmd.exe /X /C \" & ArgumentsString & \" >> \" & serverOur & \" 2>&1\", 0\nWithout CrashDump or crashed process (java.exe, yeah?) uploaded to DropBox, or reproducible testcase I cant say more.\n. There is a small chance. CrashDump is preferred.\n. Do not see the crash in the dump. Are there several java.exe or javaw.exe processes? Show WER files too.\n. Why do you think that ConEmu project issues is right place for reporting third-party software issues?\ncmder is third-party bundle.\nConEmu docs have proper description what user has to do:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html#PowerShell\n. You have not tell us what are you doing. \"which creates a new tab\" is neither obvious nor definitive.\n. Of course I do not mean internals of Windows scripting. But what do you call exactly?\n. How do you create the tab showing this message?\n. Greedy to show full command at once? I'm not an oracle but suppose you have not pass -new_console:n after start <your command>.\n. Switch -new_console:n changes behavior of the server of the started tab. It do not have any effect on spawned from this tab other tabs. It is explicit switch.\nI misunderstand why anyone may want to do automatic tab closing after short operations. User will not even see the output of the finished script/application. I believe explicit switch is proper way to show user's intention.\nHowever I'm going to do some changes allowing anyone to configure start behavior.\n. Now you may set up an alias for start utilizing -cur_console switch. Either on ConEmu\\Settings\\Environment page\nalias start=start $* -cur_console:n\nor via cmd initialization batch script\ndoskey start=start $* -cur_console:n\n. I think the key is enabled or disabled \"Install keyboard hooks\" option. Try to change it.\nDon't pay attention to the name \"Win+Numbers - ...\" - it's hardcoded in resourses and do not change dynamically.\n. Real hotkey is shown now\n. PuTTY still may take focus in some cases.\nChildGui. If this is a docker issue why do you report it here?\n. What does that mean: \"unable to use the arrow keys\"?\n. And how exactly you are running bash in that case?\n. I believe the key is that when you run \"bash\" in ConEmu tab you run it with mandatory switches -l -i. But I do not see them in your docker command.\n. @mtelesha If your solution is working, the issue can't be with ConEmu at all. ConEmu do not relate to TERM variable. Never.\n. Putty and Moba Xterm - are remote terminals, they implement their own commucation protocols.\ngit-bash is not a terminal at all. It's a shell, which may be started in terminal.\ncygwin is not a terminal too. It's a package of ported applications.\nIf you mean mintty, than it is a POSIX PTY emulator, it almost do not relate to Windows API.\nWindows applications have to run properly in Windows, haven't they?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nBut ConEmu implements (actually reuses) real Windows console window. Absolutely the same behavior you'll see if you run your shell or ssh from Win+R.\nHow many times I have to say that, I wonder?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Delusions.html\n. In the other words, Putty and Moba Xterm are doing the same work, which actually ssh.exe have to do. But ssh.exe is doing this work not quite good.\n. @mtelesha I took a look at your video. However it's not quite clear what was working and what wasn't.\nAs for your suggestion about solution and FAQ... ConEmu do not provide any remote features, right? User choose any tool for their taste. But this tool fails. Who is guilty? ConEmu? I do not think so.\nIf console application (which is ssh.exe) fails in standard Windows terminal (which ConEmu utilizes and extends in fact), I can make only one conclusion: something wrong with this console application. How about you?\nAnyway, thanks for sharing your experience, it may help other users.\n. You mentioned several times Ctrl-Shift-V, but that is not ConEmu default hotkey. What is it intended to do?\nI'm not quite sure, what happens when you execute export ... on server side. The command is executed on server, yes?\nAnyway, ConEmu do not change posting sequences when you execute export, so the problem may be inside used ssh client. But it would be interesting, what server receives?\nCan you compile and run key-reader on your server and check what server receives on problematic keystrokes (arrows and BS, right)?\n. There was no newer Preview build.\n. What exactly do you suggest? Chocolatey has latest ConEmu 15.7.16.0 now.\n. Concrete examples please with screenshots. AFAIK slashes are supported.\n. Almost all fixes accepted.\n79ff5d3\n.

The key word in your question is \"shell\".\nhttps://conemu.github.io/#Disclaimer\n. It is a feature of the Windows console. DOSKEY has nothing to do with it.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Delusions.html\n. F7 is not processed by ConEmu. The hotkey is processed by \"cmd\". Google for hotkeys or go to Microsoft web site.. You want to get crashes? That is really strange.\n. In the other words, if MacType settings do not work properly that is MacType bug.\n. Once per session. Well this is acceptable.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n. To be sure. Do you use mintty.exe?\n. http://conemu.github.io/search.html?q=color\n. I mean, there are no \"colors\" in Windows console. There are \"color indexes\" which are mapped to user selected palette.\nAnd you may choose any desired palette for powershell.exe for example on the AppDistinct page.\nAnyway, your reproduction steps are unclear. I can't understand what are you doing...\n. Well, that's better description. But I can only guess about your settings. Most probably you've set up ConEmu autorun for cmd.exe. But you are running PowerShell console. Read my comment again.\nAnyway, DefTerm integration is preferred.\n. That was not a first question about weird colors... I'm going to \"reuse\" palette from consoles attached by Win+G.\n. 150629\n. You have to connect with cygwin/mintty maintainer to ask them for saving bash history on exit. Look, ConEmu \"closes\" tabs using standard Windows messages, it do not \"kill\" any process (yep, unless you have not set #Close(1,1) on the Far macros settings page).\nWhat do I mean, the \"close\" behavior triggered by ConEmu is the same if you click \"close\" (red cross) in the mintty window title.\nMore. You bash/zsh/whatever may execute something in the moment of cross clicking. And even if you ask ConEmu to send print(\"exit\\n\") using GuiMacro it will be just ignored by shell.\n. BTW, may be there is some option in cygwin/mintty/bash to save history by cross clicking. I'm not sure...\n. I repeat. Sending \"exit\" is absolutely wrong approach. What would you have if there is some command running? The command will not reach the shell at all.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html#bash-history\n. Have not seen this recorder. But I have been asked about recording already. Would be nice I think...\n. 1. Checkboxes and radio. Well, may be at some moment. But now I have the opinion ConEmu must show console contents with minimal modifications. What about copying that into Windows clipboard? Result will be unexpected.\n2. As for buttons - request the feature from Far Team. Any console application may show a shadow under buttons like it shows now a shadow under dialogs.\n. As I've said before, ConEmu will not \"enhance\" buttons. There is nothing to do, it's all in Far Team hands.\n. This file is rewritten by each update. So:\n1. Create a copy of %ConEmuBaseDir%\\CmdInit.cmd to MyCmdInit.cmd.\n2. Find the line setting the ConEmuPrompt0 variable and change it appropriately, clear the value for example:\nset ConEmuPrompt0=\n3. Change you task contents:\ncmd.exe /k \"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\MyCmdInit.cmd\"\n\n. And what is the question?\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/199\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ANSI_sequences_processing_requirements\n. This is a sort of \"in-memory\" traffic and scanning RealConsole surface.\nCheck these settings: http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsFeatures.html#cpu-consuming\n. What do you mean by \"Doesn't seem to be work\"?\n. And what is the problem?\n. It looks like a configuration problem of your editor.\n. In other words there is nothing to fix in ConEmu at all. Your editor behaves in some weird way, even its internal commands.\nHowever, if you want to configure Ctrl+V to paste all lines - just go to the Keys & Macro page and set up GuiMacro Paste(0).\n. Hope all be OK next time.\n. It is marked there as 715\n. ConEmu64.exe -log\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n.

Memory dump if this hanged process: http://conemu.github.io/en/MemoryDump.html\n. 1. Where and what versions of cygwin have you installed?\n2. Do registry keys [SOFTWARE\\Cygwin\\setup] exist in HKLM/HKCU in either 32-bit or 64-bit registry?\n. Anyway, try new build.\n. Does \"ConEmu -basic -cmd cmd\" show the tab?\n. Than check please previous build with your setting file:\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases\nI do not see any problem on my side but at the moment I'm not able to check 192dpi...\n. 150705\n. 1. mintty in neither babun nor cygwin. It is another terminal and runs in ConEmu as ChildGui having limitations.\n2. To be able to set startup cygwin directory (may be not working in babun) refer to docs: http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartDir.html\n3. Duplicate tab starts shell in the same directory as current tab. Creating new tab starts shell in user specified directory. And again, mintty is not a shell.\n. What do you suggest exactly?\nNow I can answer only \"no, it should not\".\n. I know about average width. The question was about your suggestions.\nAlso, it would be nice if you provide some screenshots of abusing calculations. Are you on CJK system BTW?\n. Still unclear what do you suggest instead?\nAverage width was taken reasonably long ago.\n. So, you prefere the text will not fit in window at all, don't you? I doubt.\n. chcp 65001 and surprise. You'll get 80 CJK or 80 latin - doesn't matter.\n. Moreover. Do you remember I've asked about your system (answered?)?\nAnother surprise, NON-CJK conhost do not calculate CJK glyphs as two cells at all.\n. 1. ConEmu doesn't restrict user to monospace fonts. In fact, I do not know any property of the font which says \"I'm monospace\".\n2. As I've mentioned before, in some circumstances you will get the same count if CJK as simple latin.\n3. I see no way to get \"proper\" width from an abstract font selected by user.\n4. User may choose desired cell width in the ConEmu settings themselves.\n. It exists in opentype specification. Well, but does is exists in WinApi? Fontmetrics, etc. Can't check now. ConEmu supports truetype and raster fonts too...\nAnother thing to mention. CJK glyphs are wider than latin, but others (Thai for instance) are narrower.\nI mean there is no \"font width\", but there are \"average\" and \"maximum\" widths. The application can't choose \"proper\" one - user choice...\n. BTW, PANOSE exists in OUTLINETEXTMETRIC but it's almost useless because this structure is not passed to the callback called from EnumFontFamilies[Ex]. \"IsMonospace\" is only used to show monospace fonts with bold font in the fonts list (Settings dialog)...\n. Working with double-space and proportional characters was rewritten almost completely. If you still have something to request or suggest somthing - reopen the issue.\n. Help? FAQ? I consider the current behavior is a bug of cygwin/msys console layer.\nThis is clearly stated in ConEmu docs:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinAnsi.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#cygwin-terminal\n- ask cygwin devs to fix console layer\n- run mintty as ChildGui\n- wait until ConEmu managed to implement cygwin layer without drawbacks (unpredictable)\n. I say nano, vim, ssh and all other cygwin utilities are Windows console applications, don't they?\nTherefore they must work in Windows, don't they?\nSo, why they do not work properly if you are starting them from Win+R?\nc:\\cygwin\\bin\\bash.exe -l -i\nmintty is not compatible with Windows console API, it emulates its own cygwin-compatible teminal. But ConEmu is compatible with Windows console API. If fact it use Windows' console.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. mintty has no bug related discussed ticket. It just do not relate to Windows' console at all.\ncygwin is not only a set of tools. It has core which implements POSIX calls, cygterm \"protocol\" relates to cygwin core. Bad implementation of the core must be fixed.\n. Doesn't matter. Absolutely. ssh is a part of cygwin, and it uses cygwin core of course. If the core has lack of Windows console support, ssh will have the same.\nRun from Win+R\nc:\\cygwin\\ssh.exe <your parameters>\nand you'll get the same problems as you are talking about.\nCygwin or msys - doesn't matter too. msys was created as a fork of cygwin long ago. Till now msys core resembles cygwin's one.\n. Exactly. ConEmu just \"shows\" what console tools are \"printing\".\nAs about what I can do... Look at RoadMap. It states that in theory it's possible to combine cygterm with std.console. But the cost (spent time) may be large.\n. ConEmu do not do that. Probably done third party software if even Windows itself is responsible for that.\nWithout your config and/or log files I can't say more.\n.

However it must not crash in either way...\n. build 150716\nNow user may use any external downloader tool if ConEmu's internal does not suite.\n. You have to ask this question on the babun project tracker but but here, because the babun (mintty or shell) ignores startup directory.\nHowever you may check this doc:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartDir.html\n. I can't imagine what are you trying to run exactly, therefore I can't tell you anything concrete.\nTill now I thing you are trying invalid babun switches.\n. I see. Mintti is a ChildGui and some functions are not supported because it is not a console app.\n. Yep. But who reads the docs...\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/NamedPipes.html\n.

LogFiles reproducing the problem with full-screen screenshots to be sure where mouse cursor is located when you scroll the wheel. StatusBar must be visible on screenshots.\n. Can you create LogFiles with screenshots? Mouse over first split and second split for example?. The may point is that \"name\" is not unique identifier.\n. I can't check that now but may be function FindFarWindow is able to activate the tab by name. If so, you shall call Context and than close active tab. All in one macro command.\n. There is no interface for them, but you may search for these settings in the xml file.\n. It uses StatusBar background color at the moment.\n. \"Actual behavior\" was designed, therefore it is proper one.\n. Historically, there was no separate option for inactive window. So, the cursor in the inactive window was the same (and blinking) as in active window. The checkbox Inactive console text cursor was created to give ability to define separate style for inactive cursors. Nothing else.\nIf you may suggest better name and balloon description - welcome.\nI consider, the new radio such as \"Hollow\" will solve your requrest.\n. No. Contrary I'm trying to eliminate all three-state checkboxes because they are not obvious.\n. But you may hide the cursor already. There is nothing to code in ConEmu!\n\n. It must not be disabled. Instead user has to have all required files installed.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFolders.html\n. Who is there? )\nAre you aware of the topic???\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinAnsi.html\n. Please tell us if you dig something interesting.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#cygwin-terminal\n. Do you remember what you have been doing? Can you reproduce the problem?\n. Please update to 150722 and reupload crashdump if it occurs.\n. Nice config, BTW, except of crash :)\n. Last memory dump does not contain an exception unfortunately. Can you create memory dump manually, from TaskManager for example, at the moment when Assertion appears? With LogFiles it will be perfect.\n. I need log files by new alpha version\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. Same here. I need log files! Or exact repro steps...\n. @TheKingOfAtlantis 1. ConEmuHk. 2. LogFiles.\n. @Shredder121 I don't see problems in your logs. If there was an assert, it must be written into ConEmuTrap folder on your Desktop.\n. Please find one between 16:41:34 and 16:41:49 (20-12-2015). I need the assert triggered during LogFiles creation. Upload to gist, for example..\n. Both\n. @Shredder121 Why do you use so old version?\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n. I've just checked your logs and dumps. They mention 150813c, doesn't they?\n. OK, waiting. New version must contain at least much more required info.\n. @nojvek LogFiles please, for latest alpha when this assertion is reproduced.\nOS version?\n. Merged: gh-934. Please run \"ConEmu.exe -log\" and try to update. Upload zipped [LogFiles] to DropBox or some hosting.\n. If you run \nConEmu.exe -basic -detached -update\nwhat does happens?\nAlso, I'm interested in logs of ProcessMonitor especially in ConEmuC.exe process start/stop.\n. If you run in command prompt (in ConEmu tab)\nConEmuC -download http://conemu.github.io/version.ini\nwhat does it show?\n. And show screenshot of the Update settings page.\n. Update to 150727, you may use manual update, and check if the problem persists.\n. This is a log from ConEmuC64.exe only. But I need all logs at once.\n. Please reveal RealConsole (Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space) and do full-screen screenshots before Lock and after Unlock.\n. As temporary workaround - may be... (SystemMenu / Debug / RealConsole properties is a faster way)\nBut you'll lose ability to wrap lines on resizing...\n. @conan Build number!\n. 151210 is far newer\n. LogFiles please. What is the error you think?\n. I consider this suggestion is good. As an option of course.\n. Because cmd.exe is processing Tab completion too. Do you wonder that it \"process\" Enter keypresses? I don't think so. The same as Tab key.\nPasting bad text may tell your shell to do bad things.\n. The problem? The problem is that your text contains special characters which are processed by shells. ConEmu is not guilty that you are trying to paste \"bad\" text. \n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n. Also, what version of git bash have you tried? V2 has release candidate state.\n. That makes me crazy... the ssh bugs are known for years... But when users managed to properly report them to developers, cygwin team fixed them. At least few bugs which were improperly reported for ConEmu were fixed by cygwin - screen resizing, lost of buffer, ...\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/TableOfContents.html#cygwin-and-msys\n. Due to historical reasons (true color was implement by contributor for use with Far Manager) it available for \"visible part of the buffer\", the bottom part is a working area of Far Manager.\nI completely understand the lack of implementation, but it's hard to implement seamless synchronization of windows RealConsole surface with virtual ConEmu true color surface. Almost all parts of sources related to console services must be refactored or even rewritten from the scratch.\n. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b.\n\u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b. \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441, \u0443\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u0443\u044e \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u0438. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043c \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 ConEmu \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0443\u0445\u0438\u0449\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430/\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430.\nIMHO, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0435 \u0438 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0435 LUA \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u044f ConEmu \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f.\n. 1. You run Sublime outside of ConEmu. Therefore ConEmu do not \"control\" Sublime at all.\n2. You said that another programs do not have a painting bug.\nSo, why do you report Sublime bug here? ;) That is definitely Sublime problem and must be fixed by their authors.\nPS. Mentioned issue and commit was about ChildGui, application running inside ConEmu.\n. Anyone may search in closed issues.\nPlease post here link to created ST's issue.\n. To be clear. Hiding Quake mode window do nothing special, just calls WinApi function - AnimateWindow.\n. You may autosave/restore tabs on startup.\nBut I will not implement saving shell variables.\nShell state is a shell resposibility, moreover some shells doesn't even call WinApi functions to set their local environment.\nHowever, you may create your own task, where you may set certain variables in per-console basis.\nAlso, there is an Environment page to define vars for all ConEmu consoles.\n. Usually I say \"I'm not an oracle\", but\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n. Important? Debug?\nIt's important not to ruin application output.\nAnd all shells has some sort of cls, clear or even support a hotkey.\nYour intentions are not clear.\n. Putty/mintty don't provide WinApi access to their consoles. Some info here:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. That is weird and harmful feature! Same as changing cursor to arbitrary position in some \"terminals\".\nLook, if you have an editor (for example Vim or Far manager) and clear the screen on some moment, what will happen? I say, you screen will be currupted!\n. @oldmud0 Do you really think I'm not aware of console API? ;-)\nIf you read my posts cheerfully, I've never said that ConEmu can't clear screen. But ConEmu must not do that! That is a shell (console applications responsibility)!\n. I see )\nWindows console has a lot of differences in comparison with unix-style.\n. BTW, have you mentioned how mintty \"clears\" the screen nowadays? It do the scroll-down just to be sure that printed lines come out of visible area.\nEven that method is \"improper\" because Windows' console applications may write to the whole buffer, but not only visible part of it.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html\n. It's not clear\n. And why do you think it's not a mongo's feature/problem/bug?\n. Looks like a mongo \"feature\".\nI have no idea how it must work, but I can see obvious difference in the output: \"in this console\" and \"in debug console\".\nHave you tried to type same text instead of pasting?\nAnyway, I believe it's better to ask mongo's authors, but not here.\n. I doubt if it's a ConEmu problem because when pasting (how exactly do you do pasting by the way) ConEmu just send \"keystrokes\" one by one into console input buffer. So it's almost the same process as you type them.\nHowever, it would be nice to see LogFiles when you do pasting. Zip them and upload somewhere, use DropBox for example.\n. It would be much better to ask mongo's developers, why they do not accept \"brackets\" as normal keyboard input.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuArgs.html\nIt's rather disappointing when people don't want to read docs. I'm wasting time writing them...\n. Why do you ask the question here? It relates to zsh only.\ncd /c/path\n. Anyway, weird unix shells do not have ability to execute some command and stay alive. And the people abuse cmd.exe which has /p switch for decades...\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartCmd.html\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartDir.html\n. @pyhedgehog Your command will not execute bash login scripts. Obviously it's not acceptable.\nbash --login -i\nRead topic again. You suggest to cd into predefined dir. That is not what was requested.\n. CHERE absolutely clearly denoted in docs I've posted: http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartDir.html#CHERE\nBut one more note. Not all \"bash ports\" have CHERE_INVOKING in the login scripts. Cygwin - has.\n. I need at least screenshots, config and LogFiles.\n. Generally, it's preferable to add at least screenshots in the issue. Otherwise the issue has low value to community.\nOpen about dialog!\n. Why you are talking about [old build](http://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html]?\nAnd [log fileS](http://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html] can't be empty. Even on startup!\n. Capture? What?\n. Say \"thank you\" to mintty author. And ask them, why they run two more mintty.exe processes instead of using first one to display its GUI???\nAt the moment I do not think that it is a \"bug\" of ConEmu.\nIf some ChildGui do such weird things to avoid attaching in ConEmu, why ConEmu would support them?\n. I wonder, why people suffering from some ssh bugs do not report them to authors?? That lasts for years!\nusing mintty is a workaround, console applications must be working in console without third-party wrappers.\nahhh, mintty is not third-party wrapper?\n. I suppose, author may say it's not a bug, but change in behavior.\nBut ssh bugs are obvious though.\n. Actually, the shells must be fixed (@no-one-at-all has mentioned console applications bugs, but not a mintty problem from this issue). And, as I can understand, the problem with console applications, doesn't matter sh, ssh or something else, lies somewhere inside cygwin kernel. BTW, cygwin team have already fixed bugs were reported to them.\n. https://github.com/mintty/mintty\n. Just a brief look in mintty changelog gives you a solution:\nmintty.exe -d -\n. for history\nhttps://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/466\n. @sigmap  Guidelines for CONTRIBUTING.\n. There is already one similar issue here.\nAnyway, that seems like a bug of Windows 10 conhost, but I need LogFiles from you (when warning appears) to be sure.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\nIf it reproduced, I wouldn't ask for logs.\n. I wonder, why some users think log files must contain anything interesting for them? What, landscapes? Nevermind. If user wants to help it's easy to crop \"proprietary data\".\n. I'm still researching ;-) May be later I'll ask for new logs in new build.\n. Do not select raster fonts. Never. Otherwise you'll lose unicode support.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\n. @kolomparrudi Without reproduction steps I can't say anything.\n. That is too long period of course.\n. Check new build 150813. If the problem persists, I need new LogFiles. Note I need all three files, not only selected one.\n. I've asked LogFiles for new version.\n. Please, don't ignore my requests!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\nVideo is nice, may be, but is does not show required internal information.\n. Sorry, have missed them\n. @jjmartin please create another issue, it's not related to the subject. Attach your config and LogFiles+ Screenshots demonstrating the problem.\nNonrelevant posts will be cleared here.\n. I need LogFiles from updated ConEmu recorded when error appears. Even better, if anyone can provide exact steps to reproduce.\n. @kolomparrudi your zip contains incomplete sets of logs from different sessions and different days. Useless.\nI see the date/time in your comment, but there is only one log from that date.\n. Can you reproduce that with one tab opened and upload new logs?\n. What if you run *cmd.exe instead of Far? Does it reproduce on unlock?\n. Without LogFiles reproducing the problem I can't tell you anything.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. 1. Use latest alpha build?\n2. LogFiles of repro?. 1. Unbelievable. When properly started Far closes, the tab closes too.\n2. http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsConfirm.html\n.

How can I help you without screenshots or log files?\nAnd check links I've posted, especially for \"Safe far close\".\n. BTW, \"copying\" is rather bad way. You will be responsible for updating them manually each time. Moreover, you may face versions hell.\n. I will check this\n. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2016/02/02/Build-160202.html\n. Shell?\n.

That is not a ConEmu issue.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinAnsi.html\n. tig was built with cygwin/msys? Than, if it runs weird from the Win+R (not mintty) than you should report an issue to their authors...\nHowever, that may be just an encoding problem:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\n. Than, I suppose the problem is inside cygwin and do not relate to ConEmu. Read the following:\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuEnvironment.html#ConEmuCpCvt\n. @Pomoinytskyi Why do you ignore my notes? Closing this as not related to ConEmu.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/244#issuecomment-139637364. ConEmu do not know much about internal states of console applications.

And why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\n. You've tried it on two computers, but you haven't answered my question.\nRead this:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n.

How do I revert? Do I need to reinstall ConEmu? And why does the setting not allow turning it off/on?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub .\n. I don't know what have you changed in ConEmu settings. You may try\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ConEmu.exe -basic - cmd\nand check the behavior.\n. You may try to share\n.

Not acceptable. Show your screen after startup.\n. Removing what and where? From Task {cmd}?\nUnbelievable... I've tried your settings and there were no problems with overwrite mode - insert as expected.\n. That is strange and seems like not related to ConEmu.\nCan you return one/both of these options to recheck? Or change dir to another folder?\n. As docs (link was posted) mention, ConEmu do not allow to change or detect current state of ins/ovr because the mode is shell choice only.\n. Part of commits are accepted and merged in daily branch.\nIf future, please don't describe all commits with same text. Hard to check them.\nFor example, Fix memory leak (~CRealConsole, mp_Files) is much more distinctive.\n. You haven't mentioned neither the actual shell you use nor its startup command.\nAnyway, ConEmu issue tracker is wrong place to post questions about that shell.\n. Under \"git bash\" a lot of users have mentioned up to three absolutely different executables. Show screenshot at least. With status bar visible.\n. OK, from settings it's clear that you are using \"sh.exe\", indeed ;)\nTry to change it to \"bash.exe\", sometimes this fixes some problems.\nAnyway, ConEmu do not \"disconnect\" from console by timeout. That may be your shell configuration problem.\nYou may try to show RealConsole and type there. Effect must be the same.\nBut if not (almost unbelievable) I need LogFiles from you: http://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. Why do you think that ConEmu connects to remote server?\nYou insist that your shell is bash, but now you are talking about \"remote servers\". Do you know that bash.exe (itself) is working only on your local PC?\nSo, you are using some undefined application which connects to remote server. Not a ConEmu, not a bash. Configure this unmentioned application. It provides to you remote access and problems, but not ConEmu.\n. BTW, you haven't shown screenshot of ConEmu window as I've asked. Settings dialog is settings only, and there are no status bar.\n. Most probably you have to contact ssh maintainers of Windows port.\n. Also\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/#Disclaimer\n. Don't think so. Show screenshots.\n. I believe this has been fixed already.

Do you know that ConEmu provides not only \"tabbing\", but also \"splitting\"? How do you imagine this feature when both applications are visible at the same time?\nRejected. You may add hotkeys to change transparency level and do it quick.\n. Probably related: http://superuser.com/a/959337/139371\n. f11527a\n. I believe, that's a clink issue and it must be reported to clink's author.\n. Nothing strange. WhatsNew clearly says that hooking technique was changed to minhook.\nAFAIK, clink uses self-written similar technique, which may be not compatible. But I believe, if they switch to minhook it would be working.\nBTW, long ago I've suggested to clink's author tighter integration with ConEmu, but the suggestion was declined. I mean, ConEmu hooks may provide interface for clink or, on the contrary, call clink exported functions.\n. Test binaries, for those who can't build clink themselves.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/clink/releases/tag/minhook-1\n. May be, may be not.\nI'm not aware neither original clink, nor minhook \"hooking internals\".\nHowever, I trust minhook more, because it's mature enough and has contributors.\n. I think about ceasing the support of original clink, it has a lot of problems which users surprisingly address to ConEmu.\nThe best available approach (the author vetoed it) would be an interface for ConEmu. There is already excellent detouring by MinHook and if ConEmu may call appropriate exports from forked clink binary it would be the best solution.\n/cc @Stanzilla. What?\n. Do you mean Chocolatey.org?\n. I do not use package managers for ConEmu updating. It can do autoupdate itself.\nBut I'm \"using\" pacman for updating my git-for-windows installation.\n. I do not see any crashes. So, you need to either describe step-by-step instruction, or provide crash dump.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/MemoryDump.html\n. @MartinSGill\nI see two other detouring apps: NVIDIA CoProcManager and Sophos Anti-Virus. I don't have any of them and can't check. But one of them may raise this crash.\n. @nileflowers\nSame here. Crash dump.\n. @kraml Crash dump\n. 1. Both supplied crash dumps has either C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation\\CoProcManager\\_etoured.dll or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation\\CoProcManager\\detoured.dll. As I've said before, this detours may harm normal behavior of applications.\n2. Even I have installed NVIDIA drivers this CoProcManager is not installed on my PC. So I can't check anything. What is that CoProcManager??? Also, google saw a lot of issues with it.\n3. Both crash dumps do not describe the first crash. Pleas follow these steps: http://conemu.github.io/en/CrashDump.html#manual-dumps And I'm insterested in full memory dumps of crashed process and its direct parent process.\n. One more thing. Because I don't have CoProcManager installed on my PC, I need to know exact Video Card models and drivers (version, installation file name, url) you are using. And, because I'm not a end-point user of this product, seems like I can't file an issue to NVIDIA.\n. There are a lot of page found by google by simple query \"coprocmanager detoured.dll problem\".\nwww.google.com/search?...\n. And the expected result.\n\nSo, at least for tests, I need:\n- This mysterios CoProcManager folder (well, I belive the files are somewhere in the distro folder, but I need exact list of them)\n- Exact command which initialize detours. I believe it somewhere in the startup items and most probably it infiltrates explorer.exe.\nTill than I can't tell who exactly is responsible for these crashes. And may be that is NVIDIA problem, especially because a lot of another compains exist on the internet. ConEmu sources are open, but NVIDIA sources seems like to be closed. So I even can't check or fix the bug, if the bug is inside CoProcManager.\n. And I think this simple app will crash too on reported workstations. Please check.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/test-callexit/releases/tag/v1.0\n. Shame on me. Try this: https://github.com/Maximus5/test-callexit/releases/tag/v1.1\n. Is detoured.dll loaded in explorer.exe? Check with ProcessExplorer.\n. Try to filter by nvidia and show what autorun finds. Here is mine:\n\n. https://github.com/Maximus5/test-callexit/releases/tag/v1.1\n. In the latest dump from this comment I see a lot of another detours: AVG, MacrType, Sizer, HP ProtectTools.\nAnd only removing NVIDIA's CoProcManager fixes the crash? From my point of view, this fact side by side with this search query is an evidence that problems must be fixed by NVIDIA.\n. It would be interesting to find minimal reproduction code. It may help to find a workaround or to submit bugreport to NVIDIA. I prefer last option of course...\nSo, can anyone from this topic build ConEmuHk with VisualStudio or MinGW? To avoid a lot of test iterations...\n. Remove CoProcManager as workaround... Without ConEmuHk you may face another crashes and lack of features.\n. Take latest daily branch.\nCd into ./src/ConEmuHk\nSupposing you have 32bit mingw toolchain:\nmingw32-make -f makefile_gcc DIRBIT=32\nTake binary from ./Release folder and update your test location (it may be this ./Release folder).\nRun ConEmu\nConEmu.exe -basic -cmd {cmd-32}\nPost here when you have success or crash after that.\n. I said \"daily\", not \"master\"!\n. Check git submodules. ./src/modules/munhook\n. Yes, exactly. The crash was expected.\nNow, please go to ConEmuHooks.cpp, function StartupHooks. There are set of call to InitHooksCommon, InitHooksUser32 and so on. Comment them one by one from the end to start and redo build/test.\nI suppose, that after commenting InitHooksCommon the crash will go off.\n. Than, go to function InitHooksCommon and try to comment hooked functions.\n. Commenting this function has the same effect as unchecking \"Injects\". So, it's interesting to leave it uncommented and continue tests.\n. BTW, try to add following line before \"return true;\" in function SetAllHooks\nFlushInstructionCache(GetCurrentProcess(),NULL,0);\nAny changes?\n. Have you noted my prev comment? Leave CreateProcessW function uncommented and continue tests.\n. No, that was \"second\" comment. In previous I've asked you to leave CreateProcessW uncommented and continue tests with other hooked functions.\n. @kraml Can you share your final diff?\n. But there are other functions, InitHooksUser32, InitHooksClink, and others. Have you forgotten about them?\n. No. The idea was to leave only one hooked function. Other functions may interfere in some way.\nWhat OS you are using?\n. Last request for now: file SetHook.cpp. Leave only \"return true\" in the function InitHooksLibrary. Define HOOKS_SKIP_LIBRARY at the top of file for that.\n. Please check build 150821, with \"Injects\" enabled of course.\n. How about this:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/kbnz51nd4sw83lc/ConEmuHk.150821a.dll.7z?dl=0\n. Can you create crash dump (full) with this patch?\n. The ConEmuReportExe is preferred in most cases, it allows to create a dump at the very moment of crash. However, there are exceptions of two types: continuable and non-continuable. Also, exceptions may be handled by exception handlers (installed by either application or dll) and may be not handled.\nCrashes are usually non-continuable and not handled exceptions. Therefore, when you use ConEmuReportExe method you can't be sure when exception will lead to the crash, or it was trown as a part of \"normal\" application behavior.\nThe latest dump contains strange stack overflow in nvidia dll. And I'm not sure about the moment of exception.\nSo, please check CallExit v1.2 and create two dumps one by one:\n1. The app will show Press Enter to continue after start (either press Ctrl+Break in the ConEmu debugger console, or create a dump from ProcessExplorer)\n2. After pressing Enter the crash is expected as before. I prefer CrashDump from ConEmuReportExe.\n. I've asked you to create two dumps from one process. But attached dumps were taken from different processes. What happened?\n. Not yet. Preview branch was in work.\n. Build 150908 was releases. Most probably, crash will repeat... If so, I need new dumps with this version.\n. Please check the following patch and create new dumps. Two dumps is quite enough.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/temp/ConEmuHk.150908b.dll.7z/download\n. How about this one?\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/temp/ConEmuHk.150908c.dll.7z/download\n. Yes, please\n. Please, check this one. Dumps if crashes.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/temp/ConEmuHk.150908d.dll.7z/download\n. How about this patch?\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/temp/ConEmuHk.150908e.dll.7z/download\n. Can you, please, run CallExit.exe outside of ConEmu and create full dump at the moment of Press Enter to continue appears? Please, ensure that after Enter it will not crash (outside of ConEmu).\nYou may create dump with ProcessExplorer.\n. And try this patch: http://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/temp/ConEmuHk.150908f.dll.7z/download\n. Well, you may use ConEmuC to create dump if running process.\n. Weird... Last dump has no CoProcManager dll's loaded. What do NVIDIA think about?\nOK, this is last test before next release. I'm not happy with workaround, but it's working at least. Anyway, I still believe the problem is inside NVIDIA driver.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/temp/ConEmuHk.150908g.dll.7z/download\n. > I do notice that when started from cmd.e\u00adxe there are no NVIDIA coprocmanager DLL\u00ads attach with callexit.exe.\n\nThat's interesting... How did you start cmd.exe and does that cmd.exe have NVIDIA dlls loaded?\n. Weird logic...\n. Can you please create debug log files for Shell mode during execution of CallExit.exe?\n\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsDebug.html\n. How about build 151006?\nRelated: gh-341, gh-323\n. 1. Status bar is not visible.\n2. Try Far Manager without plugins.\n. Nothing strange. One of the plugins is doing something bad with console. That's all. You have to find this plugin.\n. What do you mean \"like cmd\"?\n. It's a clink issue.\n. 1. Screenshots\n2. http://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. 1. Please, don't post HUGE logs directly in the issue body. These posts will be deleted. Moreover your LOGS ARE CROPPED. Use file hosters like DropBox to upload files.\n2. Please, don't post cropped screenshots. They have no value.\n. However, from your cropped logs I can see, that your system do not support \"per-monitor-dpi\".\nSo all monitors are reported as 240dpi devices.\nI have no idea how you have configured your system in such way.\nWithout further information I can't tell you more.\n. Why do you report Microsoft problem here? Windows controls non-client area internally!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/DpiAware.html\n. Anyway, without screenshots and comments about expected window, TabBar and font sizes I can't say anything more.\n. It is Microsoft problem!\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31781767/how-do-you-scale-the-title-bar-on-a-dpi-aware-win-application\nYou may enable Hide caption always, than ConEmu can control all areas of the window. Otherwise... again, this is Microsoft problem. Don't they have developers to emulate non-client area visual appearance? Seems like. But this is weird.\nAlso, show screenshot of the main settings page.\n. 1. ConEmu may maintain physical dimensions.\n2. Turn on \"Treat font height as device units\"\n3. Show your \"Size & pos\" settings.\n. And I need LogFiles\n- Run `ConEmu -log\"\n- Drag ConEmu between monitors making screenshots of the monitor where ConEmu is located.\n. @daguej Of course I read msdn article. Suggested size is nice, but don't think that this size would fit your expectations. It's nice for browsers, perhaps, the applications which do not care about row/col dimensions. They just renders sites with flexible layouts.\n. There are visual problems with PR #1102. They have to be fixed before release\n\n. This is bad suggestions. There were reports that the option has unexpected effects on spawned processes.. Acceptably? Correct me if I'm wrong, the only complain to the size is the height of the caption bar?. @theficus 180422 is old build. But to be sure, what do you want to demonstrate? I see scrollbar cropping but it doesn't relate to that issue directly. Anyway, do you have scrollbar always ON?. Docs are rather useful, aren't they?\nEven Win+Alt+K and searching for pane is useful...\n. You can't have several consoles in one pane, if you're talking about this.\nYou window surface may be splitted into panes, but only whole surfaces may be switched.\n. Nope. Only surfaces may be splitted and switched. One pane == one console.\n. Exactly. That is not possible in the current design/architecture.\n. One pane - several consoles may be obtained via tmux.. 1. Your question is not clear. Without exact explanation of your problem (with screenshots most probably) nobody can answer you.\n2. ConEmu do not fight with cmder at all.\n. That is because of weird architecture selected by cmder. WHY it stores xml file in place which ConEmu do not support by default? I have no idea. Ask cmder author to eliminate -loadcfgfile switch. It's not a ConEmu problem!\nAnd obviously, mentioned commit does not relate to your problem at all.\n. BTW, you aren't right saying \"everybody knows that ConEmu is main application\".\nIn fact, there are reports that user realizes this fact only when they accidentally execute ConEmu.exe itself.\nAnyway, regardless of some displeasure of hiding ConEmu name and icon (yep, I'm aware of forks and derivatives, and they are not restricted by license), ConEmu has nothing in its code to fight with cmder. On the other hand, I'm not going to provide additional code to support cmder, because all required abilities are implemented already.\n. Few more statements.\n1. Placing xml file in the unusual location restricts or limits users from\n   - using \"ConEmu here\" feature;\n   - using \"DefTerm\" feature.\n2. cmder.exe (at least last time I checked it) do not pass rest of command line to ConEmu.exe. This restricts users from running some specific command at once.\nI believe that has to be fixed, don't you?\n. All in docs: https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html#search-sequence\n. It's fine. Really. Unless you start ConEmu from wrapper pinned to TaskBar.\nWhat? ConEmu must not know anything about them.\nAnd they still may be used if you pin proper shortcut. So that is not an issue at all.\n. Certanly. But ConEmu docs do not promote third-party bundles, at least yet. That's why there are no warnings about cmder.\n. Duplicate: gh-272\nSame questions to you.\n. Build 150813b (preview)\n. And what do you want? To break your domain policy?

So, delete or move out of \"program files\" your ConEmu.xml\n. It should not.\nBy default, APPDATA is suggested. That is quite enough.\nThan, if user us creating portable installation in separate folder, in DropBox for example, due to your suggestion they will face weirdness of APPDATA priority, and app will not be portable at all.\nAt last.

But due to indefinite reproduction conditions nobody can be sure...\nSlowness appears when you run existing tabs for hours?\nOr when you run new tab in running ConEmu window?\n. What is your OS?\n. These lines are expected in Windows 7. Disable automatic updates to get rid of them and get \"clean\" tests.\n. Build 160111\n. There is no way to detect associated conhost in Windows 7. Actually, conhost are detected generally for informational and debugging purposes, so \"conhost=0\" must not harm anything.\n. OK, that's interesting, what repo do you mean?\nIt may not be \"broken\" probably, because since Windows 8 conhost is spawned from console application process and this trick us not required anymore.\n. @Elfy After short look into your code... Yep, it's an interesting exercise, but seems like all your application may be converted into two API function calls: AttachConsole and GetConsoleKeyboardLayoutName. Last one is undocumented, yep.\n. Anyway, I suppose this issue is solved. If anyone still has problems, please report.\n. Yes, I suppose so.\n. Just start 3 Far's tabs. What's a problem?\n. D&D between tabs is possible, why not?\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Do you mean this: http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsIntegration.html ?\nThan, the answer is there. If it's not clear - suggest better edit.\n. Certainly. This is \"Windows\" feature, ConEmu settings can't store them.\n. What do you suggest?\n. Why you are talking about \"import\"?\n. ConEmu may be stored on USB-stick or even in DropBox. So there would not be any \"import\" when you run it on another machine.\nSo, do you mean \"do register items on each startup\"?\n. Probably I can. However, unregistering is more \"harmful\" operation, than adding new items. User may have several different configs of ConEmu on one machine and it would be unexpected behavior, when another instance drops all registered items.\n. Complains to Microsoft products must be addressed to Microsoft, don't they?\nAlso\npushd /?\n. That is because you have superfluous process git-cmd.exe. You will not get confirmation if you redefine your startup command to bash.exe.\n. Run ProcessExplorer and show process tree you have after starting \"bash here\".\n. > Even if I open up a regular command prompt and then start Git Bash with the above command line (either with sh or bash), ConEmu still prompts for confirmation.\nOf course you have! Root process is cmd, and ConEmu warns you that this process is not active.\n. That may be an effect of something in your profile files. Anyway, there is no \"proper\" way to detect if there is operation or not. That's what ConEmu just checks the process count, and if there are more than a one process (root process) you'll get warning.\nI consider you need to create an issue in git-for-windows. Superfluous processes has no sense.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/TaskBarBug.html\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsControls.html\nChange prompt with left click\n.

Web addresses are working.\nThe code is in Match.cpp \n. When you talk about \"10K lines would be much smaller\", it sounds like a joke. Do you know how many lines the RegExp implementation takes? Even in binary form...\nAnyway, I has plans to use this regexp implementation:\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/Onigmo\nBut of course it takes a lot of time...\n. May be soon I'll start new branch where anyone may help with regexps. Probably two ones.\n- Searching the beginning of the \"link\"\n- Searching the whole \"link\"\nRemember, that ConEmu supports not only file:line:col and emails, but also any arbitrary protocols, http://, ftp://, file:/// are just a few examples.\n. That is standard behavior on Windows. There is not guarantee that some application has not printed anything under cursor position. Refer to Windows API.\nAlso, buffer has fixed lifetime height, it's not enlarged during runtime.\n. ConEmu reuses Windows console subsystem. Buffer is preallocated on startup. As I've said, there is no guarantee that the buffer is not \"dirty\" under cursor position, so I believe it's unexpected to restrict user to some area.\n. You do not understand what is \"dirty\".\nBoth mintty and ConsoleZ will fail on this test:\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/test-dirtybuffer\n. The problems are\n- console lines do not have \"dirty\" flag\n- hooks may be disabled and ConEmu will not be able to monitor application activity\n  I agree, that it would be nice, but there are some caveats with implementation.\n. http://conemu.github.io/blog/2017/10/25/Build-171025.html. https://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#cygwin-terminal\nThere is no easy way. Implementing POSIX emulation is a great  concession to applications which do not want to work in Windows.\nAs for mintty and ChildGui, it's a subject to create another issue with more information - it's working on my side.\n. Closing old bugs\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html\nref: gh-227. I don't know about sshpass internals, but I'm quite sure that it's not a ConEmu problem.\nHave you read the docs?\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html#Problems_with_cygwin\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SshAgent.html\n. LogFiles, Screenshots\n. Actually, I meant screenshots of the desktop, to understand what are you doing (exact steps) and compare timings of screenshots with points in LogFiles. For example, ShareX may create screenshots using current timestamp. This will help.\n. At the moment, I suppose this relates to gh-210\n. There is no way to detect where \"readline\" was started. That is related to many other shells, not only to cmd+clink. So, to avoid numerous beeps and hungs which are reported from time to time, I've decided to lock changing cursor position to one line only.\nSources are open, if anyone has suggestion how to detect \"readline starting position\" they are welcome.\n. I suppose that with clink we may use ANSI to mark prompt tail, and it will be possible to detect readline starting... But the problem is that cygwin/msys do not pass ANSI to ConEmu core...\n. @squishleheimer Clink issues have to be reported in other place! mridgers/clink#384\n. @squishleheimer Clink issues have to be reported in other place! mridgers/clink#384\n. What is your OS?\n. @josh2112 No, mentioned MS bug relates to Win10 only.\n. A lot of complains, let's check them one-by-one...\nFirstly, I've never suggested to use 16-bit or DOS versions vim. Of course, they are not supported. Official download site suggests \"Win32 console executable: vim##w32.zip ...\".\nOther versions than official one, either not guranteed to be working, or their problems must be reported on the maintainers sites. I mean, cygwin/msys/git versions process ANSI internally, ConEmu don't get these codes, so it can't \"fix\" anything. Only official versions here, please.\nTo check or fix any issues I must be able to reproduce them. So, you have to provide thorough step-by-step description + vim configuration files. If you are using official vim, installed to separate folders, I suppose you've copied your .vimrc, colorschemes and things into this separate folder.\n. So, this issue may be closed? I think it must be reported to vim devs...\n. You've posted a great deal of comments. What comment do you mean about \"color issues\"?\nI 'm not a maintainer of vim packages of course and I'm not responsible for their contents. However, SO answer was updated.\n. If you mention this comment (brackets) I can't understand why the feature of vim which must be configured or disabled in Vim you've addressed here...\n. Colors depends on colorscheme selected in vim.\nSome vim schemes are 256 colors, they are predefined, only lower 16 colors indexes may be changed in the ConEmu palette.\nAlso, vim schemes may be true 24bit colors! They uses ESC [ 38 ; 2 ; r ; g ; b m and ESC [ 48 ; 2 ; r ; g ; b m to define colors. Obviously, these colors are \"fixed\" and can't be \"configured\" in ConEmu, they are configured in Vim schemes.\n\n. Build 150913\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html#version-check. Build 151006. The effect would be noticable on the next update.\n. Latest preview build is 150813c. Check it.\n. There is no stable version at all, so you aren't able to test it. I believe you haven't mentioned as stable version released in 2012 year.\n. If it is reproduced in alpha, the issue closing is premature.\n. So, why do not to post here exact steps to reproduce?\n. @MartinSGill Your script is working fine on my test Win 7.0 PC\n\nIt is slightly modified to print more info\npowershell\n$requiredVersion = [Version]'1.7.2'\nWrite-Host \"%PATH% is $($env:PATH)\"\nif ((git --version 2> $null) -match '(?<ver>\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)+)') {\n    $version = [Version]$Matches['ver']\n}\nif ($version -lt $requiredVersion) {\n    Write-Warning \"posh-git requires Git $requiredVersion or better.

What is about just this command output?\npowershell\n(git --version 2> $null)\n. I need some debug logs from you...\n- Settings\\Debug, Radio Shell\n- run (git --version), Save log as new file, Reset\n- run (git --version 2> $null), Save log as new file, Reset\n- Upload these two logs to DropBox or create gists\n\n. How about latest preview build 150813c?\n. And what if you run\nConEmu -basic -cmd powershell -noprofile\nand than\n(git --version 2> $null)\n. Please, show information from About dialog's SysInfo page.\n. And your $PSVersionsTable.\n. I need to reproduce the problem on my side for experiments... But I've failed to do that yet, so I'm looking for specific conditions.\nAlso, if you can find exact commit which breaks proper operation, it may help too.\n. @variab1e Don't mix issues, vim is another one.\n. @variab1e Workaround for vim help disappearing\nvim --help -cur_console:i\n. How to install PowerShell 5.0 on Windows 7???\n. What can I say. That's pity. So, you will get either crash or powershell piping problems.\nThe crash (stack overflow) in gh-272 occurred inside NVIDIA libraries, so most probably it's not a ConEmu problem.\n. How about build 151006?\n. Why do you report Microsoft bugs here?\n. Moreover, your issue doesn't mention ConEmu at all...\n. Docs say\nAppeared: Windows 7\nFixed in: Windows 10\nWorkaround exists\n. Workaround\nTurn on \u2018Inject ConEmuHk\u2019 option.\n. No ConEmu version, no screenshots.\nRead this: https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. But you show the stack and dump of conhost.exe. I need dumps of these crashed apps.\nAlso, you screenshots do not show ConEmu window at all.\n. You may use ProcessMonitor tool to compare IO requests made by tcc/le in both terminals.\n. And what about latest preview build?\n. Download page is up to date. How about it?\n. > I downloaded ConEmuPack.150813c.7z, which actually contained 150910a\nIt can't be. Just checked, ConEmuPack.150813c.7z contains 150813c. So you have to check it properly.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ProcessMonitor.html\nJust download ProcessMonitor and run it. Set filters by process name (it would be tclsh86t.exe I think) and run your script in terminals.\n. If you are using installer, it depends on your choices where you've install it and what bitness. Of course, I can't remotely \"detect\" you versions. ConEmu do shows version it has.\nAnyway, to continue support I need exact steps to reproduce, links to used software and things.\nAlso, waiting for ProcessMonitor logs...\n. How about build 151006?\n. ConEmu uses it self pallettes. Just select appropriate from the list or set up your own one...\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsColors.html\n. It's OK on my side. Reveal RealConsole to check what Write-Host has actually written to console.\n\n. Also, run the following from Win+R to recheck write-host ...\nConEmu.exe -basic -cmd powershell -noprofile\n. Settings \\ Main \\ Extend fonts?\n. Was required previously.\n. have you even opened ConEmu settings?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsIntegration.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsDefTerm.html\n. There are no bugs. Read links I've posted.\nExcerpt: you haven't pressed Register button!\n. May be, I will take a look.\n. That seems like your vim is not configured to use UTF8 as console code page. That is not a ConEmu issue, but just a vim configuration. I consider it's better to ask Vim's guru.\nCheck these links also, they may help\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/VimXterm.html\n. Sorry, but it's not clear what are you doing.\nPlease check the build 150813c\n. What version of git you are using?\n. What?\n. Hmm, and what do you want from ConEmu while using Far Manager?\n. Double click, single click... I'm lost. Left or right? What menu?\n. You are using third-pary bundle cmder. Despite the fact it has ConEmu as a core, cmder made a lot of configuration changes incompatible with Far Manager. It even do not create proper tasks for Far Manager. Moreover, cmder provides obsolete builds of ConEmu.\nIf you have Far installed with msi, you may check proper functioning running the following command from Win+R (supply full path to ConEmu.exe)\nConEmu.exe -basic -cmd {Far}\n. And?\n. Also. https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFarPlugin.html\n. What do you mean?\n. Standard FarColorer is doing md highlighting quite nice.\n. \n. Do you really think that committing meaningful information helps?\nShow full screenshots!\n. Nice, but I've asked you about Settings pages screenshots...\n. Oh, my... If you posted screenshot of settings page in your first post, instead of cropped meaningless part, I would tell you at once to add gvim.exe to hooked applications list.\n. Exect steps to reproduce, please\n. ConEmu can't inject hooks required for DefTerm feature, if target application is elevated, but ConEmu itself is not. That is due to different access rights.\n. Why do your think your question relates to ConEmu?\nFirst would be addressed to Far team (gave you checked it in RealConsole?)\nSecond is your Windows configuration!\n. Switch to Far3.\n. Build 151025\n. However, this is a bug of Far 2.x branch\n. I do not observe blinking in panels. Anyway, as I've said, this is a bug of Far 2.x.\n. @pyhedgehog That's too severily ;)\n- Anyone may paste path from clipboard in unix format: Apps+Ins is default hotkey for this.\n- It's not so hard to detect if cygwin1.dll or msys*.dll is loaded into active process. If ConEmuHk is enabled of course.\n- Personally, I hate /cygdrive prefix and remove it from all cygwin installations: http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartDir.html#cygdrive\nBottom line. It's possible and most probably will be implemented.\n. For example?\n. No one of them are well known or used.\n. Build 151015\n. Ctrl-V now converts path automatically if current app is cygwin/msys\n. You should use -new_console to define desired mount prefix.. Mintty is working \"inside\" cygwin workspace, but ConEmu is an external aggregator which starts cygwin shells.. start %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe /icon \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\\bin\\mintty.exe\" /title Bash /loadcfgfile \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\ConEmu.xml\" /cmd cmd /c \"%BASH_COMMAND%\" that is absolutely crazy...\n\nYou are trying to run mintty as ChildGui, that mean that you D&D into mintty, but not a ConEmu. But you said \"This doesn't happen in mintty.exe\"...\nmintty is minimalistics terminal for cygwin shells. If was not designed to run cmd.exe, completely. You'll get only problems from this usecase.\nConEmu provides correct Tasks for all installed bash shells from the box. Read docs: https://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html. Yeah, I've missed -icon switch.... How do you try to set config file?\n. Have a strong doubt there is a \".config\" folder in the root of the C: drive. Also, \"c:.config\" dues not equal to absolute path at all.\n. I see, have to check it...\n. Single quotes are not supported. And even double quotes are not required in you case.\n. Same as in my comment on SU. ConEmu do not \"reprint\" the prompt at all. It's a shell ability and responsibility. So you have to report this issue to clink author.\n\nI believe, you will have absolutely the same behavior if you run cmd+clink outside of ConEmu.\n. - git version?\n- What if you run \"ConEmu -basic -cmd {cmd}\"\n. > Spawning a new conemu with '-basic' seems to fix it.\nThat's interesting. I use git on daily basis and do not see problems. What option breaks your behavior?\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/CoProcManager.html\n. Also, can you please create debug log files for Shell mode during execution of git add -p?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsDebug.html\n. But what about my prev comment?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CoProcManager.html\nDoes that concern you?\n. As docs state I can't fix third-party problems which were reported by several users. You are lucky if there were no crashes on your computer.\n. Bad decision though...\n. Excluding would be worse. If vim starts from (excluded) git, you would have a crash most probably.\nDifferent technique implementation in progress.\n. How about build 151006?\n. Nobody interested...\n. Well, post here when you take a look\n. ```\nTab(2); Tab(7) Monday, 28 September 2015, 06:51AM +03:00 from harveytan < notifications@github.com> :\n\nI create a ctrl-pgdn macro to override the ctrl-tab to switch to the next tab.

First of all, the version of ConEmu and Windows are required.\n\nConEmu does not do logging of crashes, the Windows does logging instead.

Have you read docs? I think have not.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n. Without noted profile changes ConEmu can't get current path from cygwin/msys shell at all, regardless to their or ConEmu version. So, you got hyperlinks working only in tab startup directory, and it's direct descendants.\n. Do not observe such errors. ConEmu.xml please\n. I do not see \"/single\" switch in your ConEmu.xml. So I have no idea how it can appear in the jump list.\nRe-register list with \"Update Now!\" button\n. Weird... And I can't reproduce the problem too.\n. This is absolutely different situation. You've changed the name of the task, of course ConEmu wouldn't be able to run absent task. I do not consider that is a bug - user registers jump list manually.\nOriginal issue was about wrong (no space between switches) shortcut properties for created jump list item.\n. > surely I have to run Update Now to update the jump lists to use the new task name?\n\nSurely\nchanging just one task name breaks all jump list tasks, not just the one that was changed.\nUnbelievable. What is the error messages?\n. Nope. Error message is clear for renamed task, and all other links are working.\n\n\n. No, didn't.\nBut I've managed to reproduce. The problem happens if ConEmu was started with explicit switch /single.\n. Build 151015\n. - You are able to resize the quake console vertically.\n- What?\n.

The link (https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Mono) shows sort of online preview. It's totally unclear where one may download ttf file.\n. Correction. Your patch is not working on any *.ttf font I have. For example: Andale Mono, Consolas, DeJaVu Sans Mono, Liberation Mono, and others.\nAlso, without exact link to test *.ttf files I can't check anything more.\n. I see. You didn't take into account ttRecord.uEncodingID\n. I believe commit 5cbe098 will fix your issue.\n. What do you mean by BCE? What ANSI sequence reflect it? Link or example, please.\nSupported sequences in the current version are here and some vim-related are here.\nI can reproduce your problem with latest Vim built from sources and slightly updated (without plugins) vimrc.\nAnd when I look into ANSI output, I get following sequences (ESC is replaced with <), also they are wrapped by 80 chars.\n<|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<[35;100H~@k<[34;8H\n<[35;100H   <[34;8H<[1;34r<[34;1H\\r\\n<[1;35r<[33;1H        HMODULE hConEmu;       \n                                                <[33;81H<[K<[34;1H<[48;5;238m   \n     <|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<|15m<[38;5;187m<[48;5;238mchar<|7m<[38;5;188m<[4\n8;5;237m<[48;5;238m szErrInfo[<|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<[38;5;116m<[48;5;238m51\n2<|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<[48;5;238m];                                        \n           <|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<[48;5;1m <|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<[48;5;\n238m                              <|7m<[38;5;188m<[48;5;237m<[35;1H<[K<[34;8H\nHave not done thorough check yet, but at first sight Vim is not posting something critical. But I can't be sure at the moment.\n. Seems like the problem with bce is in its absence\n. I can reproduce the problem.\n. There are a lot of other things to do. Your issue requires time.\n. In other words, I'm still not sure if it's vim or ConEmu bug. More debugging is required.\n. Build 151025\n. I'm not an oracle\nWhat versions do you use at least?. https://conemu.github.io/#Disclaimer\nI can recommend you only report the problem to your server administrator or ssh-client autors.\nOf course, ConEmu bugtracker is neither of these.\n.

Also, may be conditions for the bug repro are not meeted. It's very unstable...\n. Most probably the bug will repeats in some conditions\n. http://conemu.github.io/blog/2015/10/29/Build-151029.html\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Exact key presses, please.\n. I have no \"real\" Italian keyboard. So I need to know what keys you are pressing (English inscriptions)\n. I see now\n. Duplicate: gh-310\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html#Screenshot\n. In fact, the \"babun\" is not descriptive. What executable you're running in ConEmu tab? That's why I request proper screenshots! Status bar shows this info and much more\n. ConEmu doesn't post keys to ChildGui application which mintty.exe is.\nSo, it can't be responsible for graves appearances.\nForward your issue to mintty author.\n. It's not quite correct.\nGlobal shortcuts are processed by OS internally, ConEmu do not get this key as normal key-press.\nAs I've said, ConEmu neither posts keypresses to mintty, nor prevents them. It's not possible by design.\n. Also. I'm sure that any latest changes can't be responsible for changed behavior. Perhaps you've updated cygwin\n. You may use gist to upload config file and post link here\n. Do you have such process at the moment?\nI wish to have list of handles (ProcessExplorer, select ConEmu64.exe, show View/Lower pane/Handles, save information by File/SaveAs).\nAlso, it would be nice to have its full memory dump.\n. > You need permission\n. There is no info from ProcessExplorer. For this dumped process.\n\nProcessExplorer, select ConEmu64.exe, show View/Lower pane/Handles, save information by File/SaveAs\n. Probably you misunderstood. Yes, I need a dump, haven't checked it yes, but it would be ok. But also, I need text file from ProcessExplorer.\n. 8d7b544\n. But in your last dump I see a lot of unclosed process handles too. Looking for them...\n. I do not see opened process handles in current alpha, ConEmu has only \"ConEmuC.exe\" and \"ConEmuC64.exe\" handles (servers).\n. Only current preview has process leaks. But it's older than alpha.\n. Finally. 3ddbfdd\n. Build 151015\n. You may either create your own task, where splits are configured properly and you don't need to change the layout, or wait until broken logic of automatic saves will be fixed.\n. Show the movie :-P\nSeriously, without clearness in the request I can't implement anything.\nAnyway, exotic features don't have priority...\n. As I said many times ago. Never.\n\nExample: you are running vim. Call that mysterious \"clear\" command, all your work is garbaged.\n. Nobody may know how internals of your active console application work. Proposed activities may cause even crashes in some cases.\n. In other words, clearing the screen is a shell responsibility and ability! They may do clearing properly. Actually, many shells has hotkey for this.\nThere is nothing to do with ConEmu.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n. Have you read my link? First paragraph\n\nIf you are using old build, there is big chance that your problem was fixed already. Don\u2019t waste your time reporting problems of Old Builds. Why not to update?\n. Nevermind. It's reproduced in alpha too.\n. Build 151025\n. Chrome inside ConEmu, really?\n\nI suppose that your problem relates to active focused window. Try to click with mouse somewhere.\nAnyway, when you run ChildGui ConEmu is not responsible for keyboard input, because keyboard focus is inside that ChildGui and ConEmu just does not get any keypresses.\n. Some Chrome plugin may be responsible for that. BTW, you may detach GUI application with Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space, or even from Tab menu and check the keyboard.\n. And what is the problem? Go to colors and fill them.\n. Probably, it would be much better to create pull request for Options.cpp to share color scheme with all users.\n. I'm about to add Import/Export buttons in addition to Save and Delete.\n. What?\n. Still not clear. Where? Show an example.\n. CIconList::CreateTabIconInt\n. Just push it (when fixed) to your fork, and than create pull request here.\n. Check your bash profile. More than a one process in the console are treated as \"active task\", of course.\nOpen Settings / Info, there must be only ConEmuC and bash.\n. Mine (clear install on test PC) is working properly. No spare processes. As I've said, that might be your configuration problem. Proper place for questions about git-bash is here: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git\nAlso, try the following command. That's what I used to make screenshot\nConEmu -basic -cmd {Git bash}\n\n. Have you run command I'd posted before?\n. cmd? It wouldn't be runned on {Git bash} at all. What's created for this task? Show SS of Settings of {Git bash}.\nI'm using version 2.x of git-for-windows.\n. I've asked about special command\nConEmu -basic -cmd {Git bash}\nYour screenshots were made on normal startup, at least without -basic switch.\nSecondly, even posted screenshots didn't show any \"cmd\" in your task, so cmd can't be started as tab. Hm, unless you have no \"git-cmd.exe\". But that's of course not a ConEmu problem, because this task was not created by ConEmu. As I said, run the mentioned command.\n. BTW, what tasks are created, when you start \"ConEmu -basic -detached\"?\nIf you need bash prompt, you may use special switches of \"git-cmd.exe\". Sort of \"--cmd=/bin/sh.exe -l -i\" (you ned to correct path probably).\nAnyway, this is the question for git-for-windows project, but not for ConEmu.\n. May be @dscho (maintainer of git-for-windows) may advise something?\n. git-cmd.exe is not \"counted\" itself, ConEmu is aware about it.\nThe problem (as I've understand it) is that user have two bash processes, instead of one shell.\n. So, you shall run /usr/bin/sh.exe to avoid spare processes.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/GitForWindows.html\n. @bentayloruk Unbelievable. Proper command works properly. Describe your problem thoroughly.\n. Accepted by commit cb356b0.\nImproved by 3534eee.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Of course, you can't. Until initialization finishes.\n. Run ConEmu.exe -basic.\nIf it still doesn't start, run ConEmu -basic -log and upload Zipped LogFiles.\n. Without LogFiles I can neither help you, nor fix a bug if it exists occasionally.\n. Any news?\n. Most probably you are trying either third-party config or starting ConEmu.exe with unexpected parameter.\nSeems like that \"Far Managed\" is selected add your startup shell, but it's not installed anymore. ConEmu is not responsible for that.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsStartup.html\n. Without respond issue will be closed.\n. And why do you think that it's a ConEmu bug?\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. Both clear and nano are working. Unless you explain your problem nobody can help you.\n. @eshepelyuk If you don't use connector, you have to report your problem in other places, as this page explains. If you use connector you have to check your profile settings, especially for TERM variable.\n. Command line? It's useless with cygwin/msys.\nProfiling? About active process? Perhaps it's useless too during many types of operations. For example git commands are spawning a lot of processes, which are doing a bit of work and have very short life cycle.\n. Also. Most of command lines will not fit in the status bar.\nJust use ProcessExplorer.\n. Duplicate: gh-359\n. Build 151025\n. Screenshot at least, with status bar.\nMemoryDump of vim.exe may be useful.\n. I'm interested in memory dumps of vim.exe, ConEmuC[64].exe and (probably) of ConEmu64.exe when it becomes \"Not responding\".\n. May be problem was fixed in 151025. But dumps would be interesting for build 151015.\n. Screenshot!\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/CpuIoConsumption.html\n. Of course, side effect is decreasing CPU consumption in background.\n. As about optimization, \"Sleep\" was intended to do it.\nThere is no way to receive \"only modified parts of console surface\", even no way to check if there were any changed.\nActually, from time to time the wild idea of rewriting console implementation, to substitute conhost totally. But it's a lot of work.\n. There is no way to determine changes in the console unless continuous scanning.\nObviously it consumes a bit of resources. And of course, larger the console consumes more the resources.. What do you want to verify I wonder? It's either works or doesn't. Also, Task Manager is absolutely different in Win10 and it may count process usage in new way.. Build 151025\n. 1. To fix RAW ANSI: ANSI sequences processing requirements\n2. Report docker problems (broken arrows) to docker author. E.g. docker/docker#13817\n. I do not see any problems with docker output. BTW, you are using Old Build!\n\nHave you read docker/docker#13817 issue I'd posted?\n. Same as cygwin... https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nRun the docker from Win+R (same command line as in Task). Don't run mintty. I suppose that behavior must be similar...\n. That was not what I mean. \":h0\" just disable scrolling (backscroll buffer). It must not change the behavior of properly written console application. But if it is, that most probably means a bug in docker.exe. May be too long backscroll buffer is not good for docker?\nAs about arrows - the problem is in docker.exe, undoubtedly. I'm new with Go, and I can't debug docker to find and fix problems. It must read keys one-by-one to send them into VM, instead of calling \"readln\".\n/cc @tmds, @calavera\n. Here is a patch and test  binary for the keyboard problem.\n. I'm not sure, need exact steps to reproduction with nano.\n. Exact steps to reproduction, please.\n. I do not observe any problems with Julia startup. Both bare Windows console and ConEmu tabs takes 5-6 seconds to start Julia.\nHere is sample test bat file to check startup time\n```\n@echo off\nset t1=%time%\njulia -e \"println(123)\"\nset t2=%time%\nset /A dt=(1%t2:~6,2%-1%t1:~6,2%)+(60(1%t2:~3,2%-1%t1:~3,2%))+(3600(1%t2:~1,1%-1%t1:~1,1%)) > nul\necho Started  at:  %t1%\necho Finished at:  %t2%\necho Duration sec: %dt%\ngoto :EOF\n```\n\n. Regardless the fact, that on my PC ConsoleZ and Julia show the same duration, the comparison is illegal. ConsoleZ does not hook child processes, only the shell (check ConsoleHook.dll with ProcessExplorer). ConEmu hooks all children processes.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html\nThat's why in Console(Z) advanced features are available from the root process only, but in ConEmu all features are accessible everywhere.\n. Also. It would be interesting to see log files from ProcessMonitor, where you run Julia inside and outside of ConEmu.\n. Yes, sufficient.\nAlso, I'm interested in data from About/SysInfo.\nUse gists to paste links here, please.\n. Any changes or asserts with this debug version?\nBTW, Docs suggest to use \"Load with MacTray\". Anyway, even with MacType on Windows 10 box I do not see any lags.\nWhat version of Julia you are using?\n. From you logs\n16:52:34.1542221    julia.exe   5172    CloseFile   C:\\Julia\\bin\\libsuitesparse_wrapper.dll SUCCESS \n16:52:43.6402490    julia.exe   5172    CreateFile  C:\\Julia\\bin\\dhcpcsvc6.DLL  NAME NOT FOUND  Desired Access: Read Attributes, Disposition: Open, Options: Open Reparse Point, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\nAlmost ten seconds between these lines. That's probably a bottle neck. But to be sure, please add \"Duration\" column to ProcessMonitor and redo logs.\n. Don't press Retry, press Cancel in assertion box.\nAlso, I'm interested in asserts from Julia.exe, ignore produced by cmd.exe.\n. I'm interested in memory dump of julia.exe process, taken at te moment of hung. This moment is between before-mentioned activities. Try to watch ProcessMonitor and when activity stops after libsuitesparse_wrapper... and take active process memory dump.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/MemoryDump.html#ConEmu_System_menu\nMini dump would be enough probably. At first, I want to realize call stack of Julia at the hung moment.\n. Bad... seems like \"Active process memory dump\" was broken.\nDump from ProcessExplorer is OK. Upload zipped file to DropBox and give me a link, for example.\n. 1. Update to build 151119 or newer.\n2. Start Julia from ConEmu tab.\n3. Press Win+Shift+D (new hotkey for \"Debug active process\"), Dialog will appear.

PressStart. ConEmu debugger console will start and will create sequence of [mini dumps](https://conemu.github.io/en/MemoryDump.html) on yourDesktop\\ConEmuTrap`.\n5. When Julia finishes initialization, close ConEmu window, Zip all created dumps, and push here a link.\nAlso, it would be nice to get ProcessMonitor log created during these steps.\nPS. To pause Julia immediately after start, just call in the ConEmu tab (are you running cmd.exe as a shell?) set ConEmuReportExe=julia.exe before execution julia.exe.\n. I have not changed anything special. And I have no idea what Julia was doing during this long lag.\nProbably, it's a quiestion for Julia, isn't it?\nAnyway, without debugging information mentioned above I can't tell you more.\n. cmderdev/cmder#600\n. In other words - it's just a settings. Check them.\nThey (xml file) must be the same.\nAlso, check your Size/Pos page before and after update.\nWell, after some consideration, I assume that problem may be within ConEmu, but without additional information I can't be sure.\n. Auto save pos? Than ConEmu was probably moved to another pos before shutdown.\nMost probably I can't do anything with this, but without LogFiles I can't be sure.\n. Is it an idea suggestion or patch proposition? )\nIn fact, Far Manager has a lot of command line switches.\nDon't you think, ConEmu is due to parse them all (current and future)?\nNope, I dislike this way.\n. So many words... Why don't just open Settings / Size&Pos and change console buffer height?\nMaximum allowed value is 32766 lines.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#virtual-buffer\n. @shawwn Definitely I will accept working PR.

Hmm... May be I've forgotten something, never used this right drag actually.\nSo, what's on your settings page?\n. Have you rechecked build 151025?\nAnyway, I need LogFiles for latest version.\n. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2015/11/01/Build-151101.html\n. Compare the behavior with previous ConEmu build.\n. There is no version 814.\nPlease go to release archives and check which breaks the behavior.\nOf course, it must be done on the same machine with same config.\n. I see... Try to jump by month \n. Why do you mention mintty in the subject?\n. It's unclear, what is the problem - freezes, stops, smth else? May you create a short video?\nCan you confirm that build 150908 is OK, and 151006 introduced the problem?\n. 1. Update to build 151109 at least, run ConEmu -log, reproduce the problem, and upload LogFiles.\n2. What do you mean by \"hang\" exactly? Screenshots or video may help.\n3. It would be nice to get MemoryDumps (mini at least) of all process tree at \"hang\" moment (ConEmu/ConEmuC/git/whatever).\n. This complain must be addressed to NPM/Node.js authors.\nI've examined the logs, your Ctrl+C events are successfully delivered to console processes, immediately.\nHowever, there is action to \"Terminate all but shell processes in the current console\". Personally I set it to Ctrl+X and use it often. But it really terminates processes, they will not receive any signals.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsHotkeys.html\n. Or may be not... confused by different reporters and dumps.\n- Do you have option \"Inject ConEmuHk\" enabled?\n- Does active process stop by Ctrl+C immediately?\n- To be sure, I need full memory dumps (mini is not enough), LogFiles and screenshots (or with status bar.\n. Perhaps, something blocks your prompt, but I don't think it's a ConEmu problem. You may try to use ProcessMonitor to check console processes activities.\n. So, pressing Ctrl+C in bash prompt may cause other processes spawning. That's because bash prompt may be very complex, especially if you show git properties there.\nAnyway, It's hard to believe that this issues relates to ConEmu and can't be reproduced in the real Windows console\n. I propose to close the issue, because it's not related to ConEmu itself.\nAlso, there is cygwin connector nowadays.\n. Without exact dumps and screeshots \"hangs\" are not accepted.\nNobody can reproduce some abstract bug occured in abstract environment.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. @jeffijoe As I said before, that is NOT a ConEmu issue!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. I do not believe in that. How exactly do you start that what you named \"git bash\"?\n. When you run git-bash.exe it starts mintty.exe. Of course this is not a standard Windows terminal, when you run bash in standard Windows terminal bash behaves differently. So, why do you think that ConEmu must fix bash bugs?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. I added a paragraph for mintty\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html#mintty\n. Yeah. The problem comes from different implementations of Ctrl+C processing in cygwin/msys applications. POSIX applications are ready to process \"signals\" in most cases, but often ignores console events.\n. @jeffijoe that will not. Why do you think so? \n. Crash dump please. And try latest update.\n. Yes, I understood. But I need any of them to acknowledge the problem.\n. At least \"mini dump\".\n. Thank you for suggestion, but no, I don't see much sense in the suggestion.\n- \"Nobody reads docs\".\n- Even anyone reads docs, they \"ask google\" first.\n- Official site with docs is much preferable because of globally available links for social networks etc. Yep, application PR... I tremble on every visit on my site ;)\n- All essential information is available in About/Help, Hotkeys page    dialog and Settings dialog hints.\n- Implementation of downloadable docs would take time and nobody would use or read it...\n. It's unclear how to reproduce your problem, and why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\nSeems like your application writes only \\r to console.\n. Show screenshots?\n. Without exact steps to reproduction I can make any conclusion. At the moment I believe the problem is not in ConEmu.. Perhaps related to gh-1123. If you don't use wslbridge, the bug is inside WSL. If you use wslbridge, perhaps it's your PS1.. Not enough information.\nHow do you start bash? Screenshot? PS1?. Unless you are using wslbridge+connector you may observe bugs of Bash.. https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html#connector-ps1\nIt says\n\nNB Don\u2019t forget to \u2018escape\u2019 non-printable parts of PS1 with \\[ and \\]. This is required to avoid weird behavior of readline when you type really long commands.. @ZYinMD Your question is offtopic here.\n\nOriginal issue was reported about meteor. I still think the problem may be inside meteor itself.\nIf anyone still suffers from the issue (@bduff9 ) on the current ConEmu preview build (ATM it's a 180626) please post here versions of your software: Windows, Meteor, shell you are using, and other information you find useful..

Connector v0.7.\nRun it with --log switch, optionally specify the directory, for example --log /c/temp.\nReproduce the problem, take screenshots and a copy of log-file of each step.\n. How it goes?\nJust for note: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinHome.html\n. Is this issue actual?. > One way it works well when I am ssh'd into a machine except when pasting into a nano window it all pastes in one line\nCheck Paste options in ConEmu\n\nIn that mode also git add -p which uses perl blocks the terminal entirely when I run it, so it's not usable for local work\n\nHm? In ssh'd session or locally? I didn't get it\n\nThe other way works well locally but through SSH I then get garbage in some circumstances.\n\nMay you provide examples?. 3b594f1\n. - https://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsStartup.html\n. Links describe how to do that.\n. And \"Active tabs\" on the https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTasks.html\n. What do you suggest to rename?. https://conemu.github.io/en/Whats_New.html#Build_151205\n. Use two fingers to scroll contents.\n. Pease read: https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. What? You have nothing to add, or issue is fixed?\n. So, why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\nDoes IME work in {cmd} tabs? If so, read this: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html and this: https://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\n. Just enable Unicode support in your shells (bash, ssh, ...)\n. Uncheck \"Monospace\" in font settings\n. - Show full screenshot with StatusBar visible\n- Post here a link to a file you are trying (to cat?)\n- Show screenshot of Settings/Info page (may be together with first one)\n- Show information from About/SysInfo\n. Actually, it's good to have proper reports from CJK users. Appreciated, will dig it.\n. True. Connector switches console to UTF8 codepage, that dusables DBCS marks in turn. And this also brings double-width craziness back.\nI'm not sure, how we can deal with double-width characters... Console application may expect the line would fit 80 symbols, and what must happens if there are 80 double-width symbols? Have to check other terminals behavior... in Unix/Mac also.\n. How about latest builds?\n. Same as previous. Uncheck \"Monospace\" in font settings\n. How about build 160111?\n. It is not a ConEmu issue. Report this to git maintainers.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. You should report this to cmder authors... Or not.\ncmder is sort of \u2018boot loader\u2019 for ConEmu.\nBut due to badly selected architecture users face problems. Variable CMDER_ROOT is one of them.\nSo, to solve problems...\n1. No need to pass icon as /icon switch. Just put proper ConEmu.ico into conemu-maximus5 folder.\n2. Of course CMDER_ROOT is not set on ConEmu.exe startup, but there are ConEmuDir and ConEmuBaseDir and it would be better to use relative paths with it. For example, /icon \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\..\\cmder.exe\".\nAlso.\nIt's rather strange that cmder in default config starts between monitors if they are small enough,\nand it do not save changed window position on exit.\n. > It does not work for me :-(\nWhat have you tried exactly and what did not work?\n\nBy the way, are the environment variable\n\nAll in docs. List of environment variables set by ConEmu\n. Create a task, named, for example, {my-cmd}.\ncmd /k \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\..\\init.bat\"\nAnd put into \"Command\" for \"ConEmu Here\"\n/single /cmd {my-cmd}\n. Run ConEmu -basic -cmd cmd and try again.\nConEmu does not maintain shell's command history.\n. If you are using clink - don't use its old builds!\n. Learn about chcp 65001\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. What are you doing exactly?!\n. OK, batch file. What do you do with it? Should I guess?\n. It is working.\nRead this: https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Shell? Do not mean python.exe?\nIt's console application, the are not processed by DefTerm engine. You have to use -new_console switch\n. That happens because of python's Idle architecture crazyness.\n\nThe window \"Python 3.4.x Shell\" is created within one pythonw.exe, which is hooked by DefTerm properly, but command (python.exe) is executed within child pythonw.exe process, which is not hooked, obviously, because it has no GUI window!\n. Same behavior in mintty. Consider this is a bug of readline, report it in correct place.\n. Depends on $PWD and $PS1 I believe.\nAnyway, 1 is has same problems on my PC in both ConEmu and mintty.\n. Sorry, have played a lot with different profiles, and this one had incorrect PS1 (specials were not escaped properly).\nNow I can reproduce the bug in ConEmu.\n. 151208\n. What is the version of ConEmu? What is OS version?\nAnyway, I don't think it's a ConEmu problem. Someone (may be OS) shows RealConsole in some weird way (even no min/max buttons there). ConEmu do not do these tricks.\nCtrlWinAltSpace may hide it or not.\nBut LogFiles created for when the problem reproduced may be interesting.\n. You may reopen the issue if you have required LogFiles.\n. It doesn't work. Seems like 937d5da is proper fix.\n. Sorry, missed its on screenshot\n. 6f285b5\n. So, how about new build?\n. a1bae47\n. Warning is shown once per session. Just don't close ConEmu window.\n. There were reports that MacType caused crashes. Users have to be warned.\n. Would it be sufficient to have switch ConEmu64.exe -NoMacTypeWarn?. 190310\nYou may run ConEmu64.exe -NoHooksWarn.\n. Thanks\n. I'm lost. What's the problem?\n. /cc @techtonik does that relates to your Go question?\n. Sample Go program?\n. I don't see any problems with example. It reads one line at a time. Enter stops reading, no additional keypresses (like Ctrl-Z) are required.\n. @libliflin Unless anyone provides Go example where this feature is required or even helpful - I can't do any test.\nAlso, I consider this proposal as harmful, because this feature may break further execution of your app.\n. 4b4a466\n. OK, 364a769\n. And do you really think it helps?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Possible duplicate: gh-467\n. Thanks for report, found it.\n. 150813f\n. And 151217\n. Explorer ignores, well it actually do not even support, change/apply variables for its process.\nBut when you run ConEmu...\n1. It inherits all variables of parent process. For example, you run terminal from WAMP, GitExtensions, something, and you have properly changes/configured environment. Well, what would you have, if ConEmu just \"reloads\" variables from system? All \"proper\" variables would dissapear.\n2. User may even export changes from console up to ConEmu process. You would lose these changes too.\nSo, I consider processing of this message would be harmful\n. Hmm. Probably, ConEmu may ask user what they want to do, when WM_SETTINGCHANGE received.\n. @reider-roque https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/468#issuecomment-167166618 note 1\n. PATH may be set not only by \"export\".\nAs I've said before, ConEmu may be used as a terminal for other products (WAMP (Open Server), MAME, build environments like Mozilla, and so on).\nAll of them set env.vars, and PATH is one of them.\nSo, PATH actually differs from system at the moment ConEmu starts.\nHowever, we may save this startup delta too.\n. @zhaoguoyuan Look, even if ConEmu would renew its environment (in roadmap actually) the application, running in ConEmu tab is running on their own responsibility. There is no proper way to \"change\" environment in some external process. For example, cygwin doesn't ever call Windows environment API functions.\n. Sort of workaround.\nYou may run cmd (or cmd -new_console:z if you use DefTerm) and export variables to ConEmu. Perhaps attach is required before export.\nI believe, this may be automated via one shortcut on the Desktop.. So, why do not to decrease the size of tab bar? It may be configured on the \"Tab bar\" page.\n. Save settings and restart ConEmu?\n. Can you please run ConEmu -log -detached with this small size of tab font, make screenshot (to be sure), and attach here link to LogFiles?\n. 151222\n. Probably a bug. While I checked you issue, it reproduced in ~10%. Please run ConEmu -log, reproduce the problem and upload LogFiles somewhere (dropbox, gist)\n. Build 160111\n. It's impossible.\n. I'm lost. What do you want at last?? Show sketches perhaps\n. Why don't just use \"Normal\" mode with specified size (width)??\nMaximized windows are expected to be maximized.\n. > no, it doesn't. I run on a 30\" Dell (2560x1600), and whenever I put either 2560px or 100% in the width, it downsizes to something like 1873px\nno, ConEmu does use full monitor width when you specify 100% as Width.\nAs I've said, \"Maximized windows are expected to be maximized\", so you have to choose Normal+100% for desired behavior.\n. Ref: gh-284. 151222\n. What is the problem and what do you want/suggest?\n. The current logic is that if you run ConEmu with special /cmd switch (which is implied actually by DefTerm feature), ConEmu will suggest this specified command as default for new consoles. But only in the current session. This do not affect neither Settings/Startup, nor new instances of ConEmu started without /cmd switch.\n. > but somehow this default stays beyond the session\nReally? Do you close ConEmu? Or just minimize to TSA?\n. At least LogFiles. Video would be nice too, it may help.\n. Screenshot\n. Version, version, version!\n. It's not reproducible.\nTake clean ConEmu, Far, default settings (both ConEmu and Far), and retry. Something on your side harm D&D.\n. 6a77e8f\n. How to check package without uploading?\nWhat does this package do? Provides required files to implement embedding console?\nThan the package must not contain dozenz of files, but only binaries and may be license?\n. Default Terminal?\nWho is the PID mentioned in \"Injecting hooks into PID=...\"?\n. PowerShell.exe? That was the PID?\n. Do you know what is PID? I've asked about what processes they are.\n. If you disable hotkeys in ConEmu (what exact actions?), than Aero Snap is done by Windows, and ConEmu can't handle it at all.\n. > [Disabled] Decrease window width (check \u2018Resize with arrows\u2019)\nThese hotkeys are not related to \"snap\" at all. They tries to do exactly what is described: increase/decrease the window size (by one cell actually).\nI don't understand your problem. Is it still actual?. @maphew Installer updates only files installed by it (msi). I have no idea how did you obtained old 32bit exe.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Installation.html#installer\nAnyway, bugs from obsolete versions have no value cause they meaty be fixed already.. Chocolatey package is named ConEmu. What is the sense in .Console suffix for nuget? I tend to think common name of the project (ConEmu, if not ConEmu-Maximus5 which is long) would be better, isn't it?\n. Perhaps, \"ConEmu.Core\" is preferable.\n. Strange. Just tried to build the project with this package.\nIn packages subfolder VS unpacked all files properly, but when I build Debug config, it copies only part of files into bin/Debug.\n. Do you mean created *.nupkg file? Or sources of the project which I'm trying?\nLatest branch: 8740e7f\n. https://www.dropbox.com/s/mmtsnf4fonodz7q/ConEmu.Console.15.12.17.0.nupkg?dl=0\nTried in VS14\n. \\ ConEmu.exe\n\\ ConEmu\n        ConEmuC.exe\n        ConEmuC64.exe\n        ConEmuCD.dll\n        ConEmuCD64.dll\n        ConEmuHk.dll\n        ConEmuHk64.dll\nActually nothing else is required. Well, for Far Manager this list must be extended with plugins and ExtendedConsole, but is it required for embedding? Perhaps isn't.\n. All binaries may be placed in one folder.\n. rebased to 38d8327\nJust noted, that first commit message was created in wrong codepage. UTF-8 is expected in this repo.\n. BTW, in 38d8327 <description> was updated, note about ConEmu.Core added.\n. At the beginning of commits there were some with 1251 encoding, true. May be that's the reason.\nFor obvious reason I don't rebase full repo ;)\n. https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConEmu.Core/\n. Hm, cp1251\n. it was\ni18n.commitEncoding = cp1251\n. ConEmu -config myputty -reuse -cmd putty <server>\n. 325edfb\n. https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConEmu.Core/15.12.23\n. 151224\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html ?\nUrls are case-sensitive, by the way.\n. I believe, suggested url was http://conemu.github.io/en/Issues.html and it's working.\n. Anyway, the crash was occured in OldBuild. If it reproduces on actuals, please reopen the issue with fresh dump.\n. 151224\n. I can't confirm that. Icon was set properly.\n. Update your list first.\nDoesn't help? Put here settings, screenshots, steps, ...\n. How about latest preview?\nPerhaps, fixed since 151126\n. Sorry, I still do not understand your issue. Is it all about three points mentioned above?\n1. Why? What? List works everywhere.\n2. There is no \"64 bit GUI\". What GUI? Studio? It's x86 only, everywhere. x86 argument after vcvarsall.bat? But don't you really think, that ConEmu have to add all supported platforms by vcvarsall? There are seven options! User may clone or change the tasks on their taste.\n3. Why do you talk about icon cache at all? There is \"Update Now!\" button on the \"Task bar\" settings page.\nAt last, about your screenshot. It do not match current build, and conents of the Task do not match expected contents of default Tasks.\nAt the moment this issue looks like a false report.\n. I see now. going to fix.\n. 1. ConEmu build!\n2. Settings\n3. LogFiles and screenshots\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Without required information issue will be closed.\n. Ok, I'll fix it.\nBut this same was not even intended to be used.. user may set up this hotkey from ConEmu settings.\n. 1. There are huge amount of vim distro/bundle/versions. I do not know which you are trying. Check official, without plugins, and with these lines in vimrc only.\n2. ConEmu hides cursor if application asks about that. That may be either your config problem, or bug in one of plugins.\n3. ConEmu's StatusBar shows real cursor position and visibility. But there's no screenshot in the issue.\n. It would be better to ask about \"clean\" vim startup in other places... If I were you, I would create new vimrc with these four lines and check it.\nIt's \"official\" vim, not cygwin's or msys's ones, isn't it? \n. chcp 65001\n. Have you compiled vim with cygwin?\n. Official vim is not compiled with cygwin. It's a VS or MinGW (but not msys).\nIf vim is linked with cygwin or msys, then it downfall to 16 console colors, unless you are using cygwin connector.\nAnyway, first step of your checks must be latest official vim without plugins and clean vimrc, as I told many times.\n. Probably, you'll get help if just ask the question in proper place: vim has mailing list for user questions.\n. Yes. What's the problem?\n. Run ConEmu -basic -cmd {cmd}\n. Run run \"ConEmu -basic -log -cmd {cmd}\" do double click and upload LogFiles to DropBox or gist.\n. By default, clicks and double-clicks are sent to console application. There is no way to know if it aware of mouse events or no.\nSo, two ways:\n1. Hold Alt or Shift when you double click\n2. Change modifier to <Always> for Text selection on the Mark/Copy settings page.\n. What is your question?\n. But that is default behavior, isn't it?\nOnly double clicks to word selection requires holding Alt or Shift.\n. Same problem. Console app may use mouse internally.\nAnd using middle click breaks UI habits.\nHowever, I have some ideas to improve mouse logic. Later...\n. You have not told us what are you trying to run.\nBut it seems like you ask ConEmu to run clink integration and run it from some other place.\n. As I've said before. You try to initialize clink twice.\nAlso, I still don't know what are you trying to start in ConEmu tab?\nClink's initialization may be triggered\n- from Settings/Features\n- from registry Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor::AutoRun if you choosed this option when installing clink.\n. Try to update CmdInit.cmd from here\n. OK, will be fixed in next release\n. Different configs -> different window properties -> different icons.\n. AppModelId was implemented to keep them ungrouped.\nI see no reason to keep grouped different applications.\n. In other words, your pinned icon was pinned improperly, it was pinned without proper AppModelID.\n. What for?? You may pin \"new\" shortcut by internal menu item from taskbar. The only thing you have to do - ensure that new pinned shortcut have proper command arguments (Explorer do not store arguments during \"pinning\", weird...)\nI want to say, no other third-party software is required, new pin may be created in two steps only!\n. I had changed pinned shortcut arguments many times on Win 7, 8, 8.1 and AppModelId remained. Perhaps, you've set different arguments?\nAppModelId calculated on arguments you've specified. So different machines (different command lines?) lead to different IDs.\n. Explain what? Why if first case there is no ID? If ConEmu started without any meaningful switches, ID is not set to application.\n. Reg file is interesting, BTW. Personally, I explore shortcut properties with \"Lnk-file Viewer\" Far Manager plugin.\n. Exactly.\n. If user ask system to run exact shell (cmd), WHY system might run another shell (bash)??\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/Delusions.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/TerminalVsShell.html\n. I see no difference between 1 and 2\n. Why do you asking here? PSReadLine is absolutely independent project with its own bug tracker.\n. ConEmu do not do any highlighting. It's a shell ability and responsibility. And its plugins of course, which PSReadLine is.\n. Going to use regexp-s\n. And how do you imagine this use case?\nAt the moment, I believe it's not a ConEmu problem or projected feature. Try something like cygspawn project?\n. \"%1\" is processed by Explorer. Of course, \"%2\" wouldn't work at all.\ncygspawn is open-source project, and new functionality may be easily added.\n. ConEmu can't decide which paths have to be converted, and which have not. For many reasons...\nUsers may configure this themselves, using script you provided, or using third-party tools.\nPersonally, I prefere to use Far Manager instead of Explorer everywhere.\n. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0447\u0438\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e?\n. \u0411\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435.\n. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 - \u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b.\n.

Don't you really think I must guess what font you are trying, what build, what OS, etc.?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. What I'm doing wrong?\n\n. You ask Windows for special Font (Family, Size, Charset). Of course, if the font does not exist, Windows (not ConEmu) creates most alike font from available list.\n. Done\n. These are some crazy and \"impossible\" errors.\nIf they repeat, please reopen the issue. Till than I close is, because it looks like as non-reproducible...\n. I have long queue of TODO and bugfixes. As soon as your issue is fixed, you'll be notified.\n. It's not a DefTerm. It's an Autorun, which is registered on ComSpec settings page.\nAnd you have not specified the build! Why?\n. So, what do you want from ConEmu? \n. If anyone produces tons of processes, how do you imagine ConEmu may limit this tons to one process? It's not a ConEmu problem at all.\nMoreover, mentioned ComSpec autorun integration is obsolete and not generally recommended. It may work, but only with cmd.exe shell.\n. First. You've attached the one screenshot. What is it? ConEmu? Have you compared tcc behavior started from Win-R at the same time on the same machine? I don't think so.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/RealConsole.html\n. I do not see any problems with it. For \"fixing\" anything, I have to be able to reproduce it at least.\n\n. Screenshot! Of tcc-64 started outside of ConEmu and eset called.\n. > Does ConEmu leave any traces in registry? I was experimenting with ConEmu a few months ago (when we were having issues with commands crashing, etc); I wonder if something got left over there that changed anything??\nHow may I know where you've selected to store settings? Open Settings dialog and check yourself.\n\nI noticed, for example, that \"Inject ConEmuHk\" is disabled, though I thought default was enabled??\n\nOf course, it is checked by default.\n. > Is your tcc/le 64-bit or 32-bit?? I was using 64-bit, but might try 32-bit and see if anything changes.\nYou may see it in my status bar. 64-bit.\n. 1. I know how working eset looks like. I've asked about \n\ntcc-64 started outside of ConEmu and eset called.\n2. There is newer tcc/le version 14.0.6. Probably, it doesn't matter, but...\n3. Run single tcc in default ConEmu. Preferably with clean tcc/le profile!\n\nConEmu -basic -cmd c:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc\n. I consider this was a bug in tcc/le. It did not reproduce in 13.x, it does not reproduce in current 14.x. Also, obsolete 14.x is not available for download and check.\n. d83ac5b\n. Hm. Have you mistaken with issue tracker? It's ConEmu, clink features must be requested on the clink project site.\n. Do you agree that clink is separate product?\nAnd how do you imagine ConEmu may change behavior of this separate product?\n. Wrong approach. Who create these tabs? Who name these tabs? At last, who decide the mode clink must work?\nIt's a user choice!\nSo, this user may disable simple integration with clink on Features page and setup his tasks for their taste.\nAutomatic loading of clink was implemented as a little bonus just to \"work from the box\". If anyone wants complicated settings they are able to configure it themselves.\n. As I've already explained, \"integration\" with clink was implemented as a bonus, just to work from the box. I don't intend to \"improve\" this integration, because it has no sense. User (you) can change any clink arguments from Task, batch or whatever else without any problems. Just disable \"Clink\" in settings and call it directly with desired arguments!\n. I do hold my own installation in non-default location and there is absolutely no problem with it's auto update.\nYou have to bring details to step further.\n. If you've originally installed ConEmu with MSI in some location and than MOVE it's files to another location - you've done VERY bad thing.\nTo get \"portable\" application in arbitrary location(s) you have to use 7z package.\nThat is the way MSI done its work. How do you imagine, for example, MSI's \"restore\" feature may deal with moved files??\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/UpdateModes.html#manual\nYou may test it right now\n. Also. Whey you run ConEmuSetup.*.exe without arguments, you'll see something like this:\n\nIt clearly depicts which version is and where installed.\nAfter starting the setup wizard anyone may check and change used components and even change destination folder.\n. Sorry, I do not believe. Why do you talk about this feature and show the screenshot of PowerShell? The feature was implemented for Far Manager.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/ResizeAndMove.html\n. \n. Do you use Far Manager? Seems like not. So, why do you use this option??\n. Appearance -> Hide caption always.\nUse proper options to obtain desired behavior!\n. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2016/01/24/Build-160124.html\n. 1. Run ConEmu64 -basic -log -cmd {cmd}. Is the buffer height set?\n2. Run ConEmu64 -log. Is the buffer height set?\nMake screenshots of ConEmu window in both cases (with status bar visible).\nAttach screenshots, LogFiles and settings.\nATM, I have no idea why the crash occurs. Probably, there is some heap corruption, but I can't be sure.\n. Also, I need to know, if there any differences with this debug build:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mx9cnxlizo3ofkd/ConEmu64.exe.160111D.7z?dl=0\nIf crash stil occurs, I need crashdump.\nPlease, don't inject files into issues. Blowing up their size may harm project in future. Use any file hosters, of even your own gist as you wish.\n. Very strange crash. It can't happen heither in ConEmu64.exe (the code which may trigger it is related to console server part), nor in Windows 7. Still examining.\n. Anyway, the build 160124 is actual at the moment.\n. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2016/02/02/Build-160202.html\n. No answer. Closed.\n. 1. Attach your settings (link to gist or DropBox)\n2. Run ConEmu with \"-log\" switch, reproduce the problem (no fullscreen, reverting to normal). Please make screenshots of each step to clarify your actions.\n. Your file (link \"settings\") is deleted from dropbox!\nAlso, I do not see link to LogFiles.\n. Logs are plain text files, anyone may cut data they don't want to share.\n. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2016/02/02/Build-160202.html\n. I need LogFiles\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\nRun \"ConEmu -log\", reproduce the issue, create screenshots of you whole area to avoid misunderstandings, attach zipped logs and screenshots via DropBox or something.\nAttach your settings too.\n. I've asked about screenshots. The logs itself do not clearly describes what are you doing and what do you expect.\nFull-sized screenshots where all monitors space is visible, to understand window position and problems.\n. Is this still actual on latest builds?. @meffect Didn't understand you. Are you observing the problem described in the issue?\nPerhaps related to gh-284.\nWithout further information issue will be closed soon.. And what is your complain about? You, personally, have checked option \"Minimize to TSA\".\nWhy do not to search through settings dialog?\n. Seems like your patches were made for much more newer version than shown on screenshot. Reviewing them...\n. > hope it also support chinese\n\nDo you mean interface localization? In plans, but not in the nearest future.\n. Next time please create git messages in English. Automatic translation is not good.\n. Was it closed accidentally? Only one commit was cherry-picked yet. Or all your problems are gone in current release?\n. > I mean that which files should be translate and how to organize them?\n\nLocalization is not supported yet.\nAt the moment, you may \"easily\" translate Menu items, Settings dialog, its hints (tooltips), and Hotkey names. These resources are located in ConEmu.rc and ConEmu.rc2.\nMessageBox resources are spreaded by code and I have to implement some general string storage, before localization may be done easily.\n.

ConEmu plugins for Far Manager!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFAQ.html#Far_Manager\n. 1. Check plugin version, check is loaded properly\n2. Add screenshot\n3. Add settings\n.

How exactly do you run ConEmu?\n2. What is the default console?\n. You have not answered my questions at all. Paraphrasing.\n1. What exact command line has ConEmu.exe?\n2. There is no term \"default console\", so I can't guess what do you mean. Explain please.\n. Thanks\n. 45f9ed3\n. Please run ConEmu64.exe -log, redo steps to assertion, close ConEmu and push here a link to zipped LogFiles.\n. What version of python?\nWhat shall I do to reproduce?\n. I do not see problems with subprocess.PIPE in current ConEmu build.\n```\n\npython -c \"import subprocess; print(repr(subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', '--abbrev-ref', 'HEAD'],stderr=subprocess.PIPE)))\"\nb'master\\n'\n```. https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. I believe, the link I posted contains all required information. Especially this section: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html#Complains\n\nWell, let me say in other words. All cygwin applications behaves differently if they are started from mintty and from RealConsole.\nWin+R: Check your application\nPS. Your original comment is not descriptive, especially in part of process trees.\n. I wonder, why do you omit information, that ConEmu shows Assertion box before the exception?\n. Anyway, I'm interested in LogFiles if you can reproduce the problem.\n. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. The link tells exactly what you shall do.\nCrash reports\nIf you are reporting a crash, ConEmu shows you a thorough message with information where CrashDump was saved. Please, zip the file and upload it to DropBox or any other hosting.\n. Also, you are using obsolete build.\n. Search issues. I've already answered this question, more than a once.\nImagine, Windows would have a hotkey to Clear The Monitor. What shall it do? Fill screen with black color. And how do you think running applications and Windows would behave after that? Garbage, rubbish and more.\nNever.\nWant \"clear\"? Depends on the used shell, read help about it. cmd has cls.\n. Nobody reads docs, right?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html\n. To be clear, I tried the feature in Tera Term, and it doesn't work. At all. Docs provides more information.\n. search issues\ngh-372, gh-234\n. Almost any key may be remapped. I don't see any problems with that.\n. All hotkeys are configurable and working.\nI don't want to add any items to the toolbar at the moment, because I believe, that toolbar must be fully configurable, but that will take time. In future, may be, use hotkeys now.\n. Why don't tell that to Microsoft designers???\n. .Net for terminal? Never. It must be portable and lightweight.\n. @variab1e Really? And how do you suggest to implement these colors?\n. No, dimming the icon is poor solution and it wouldn't be enough vivid.\nThanks to MS, developers have to invent a wheel instead of using standard controls.\n. @variab1e Nothing is possible until developer draw the TabBar themselves.\n. Please explain to Microsoft why their UI is bad.\n. Sorry, but what \"this\"?\nAnyone may configure their tabs like https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/552#issuecomment-266972278 and it was implemented long ago. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Ref: gh-988. https://conemu.github.io/en/WindowsEnvironment.html\nReboot your computer\n. I do not believe in that, because\n\nConEmu inherent all variables from calling process\n\nThat means that something happened with either PATH or your system directory.\nAnyway, without screenshots (evidence) nobody can imagine what happens on your side.\n. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. So?\n. These paths are NOT injected by ConEmu.\nCheck your shell profiles.\n. ed7da66\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html !\n. Looks like this do not depend on \"starting application\", but only appearing the file ~$ck...docx on the left panel.\nAnyway, I have to reproduce the problem on my PC to make a conclusion. At the moment, it doesn't look like a ConEmu problem.\n. @Kerberos464 I need at least Far profile (color settings).\n. Clink do not know anything about ConEmu specific OSC. Reflow is triggered by clink, but I don't think it's a bug, but limitation.\nPerhaps, it's preferable to configure prompt via clink profile.\n. Finally, I consider this is a clink problem and clink must take into account length of OSC codes (strip them or somehow ).\nAlso interesting, when you type the command and press Esc, part of the command is not erased.\nAnyway, ConEmu can't change or \"fix\" clink's internals.\n. Why do you think it's ConEmu problem?\n. \n. Show the screenshots at least\n. 1. But I do not see screenshot with bare cmd \"where it's working\".\n2. I have no idea what command line is used in your startup task.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. RTFM: https://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n. I mean that ConEmu does not control any ChildGui and does not process any keyboard or mouse input for them. So, it can't change or \"fix\" ChildGui input problems.\nAlso, I do not see any sense in ChildGui at all, there are console ssh clients.\n. Why do you talk about mintty? This is ConEmu border configured (by you) in settings.\n. Set to 0 frame width, what's the problem?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsAppearance.html#frame-width\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\nConEmu does not control the contents of these applications!\n. 1. Run ConEmu -log\n2. Making screenshots of each step reproduce the problem.\n3. Post link to https://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html\n. I need screenshots to be sure about moments of logs. Also, uploaded logs shows two started tabs: mintty & cmd. The screenshots from the post shows only one tab. Obviously, I have to be sure what happens on your side, but I haven't.\n. I suppose it's ether your mintty configuration problem, or even a mintty bug.\n\n. Why you all facing mintty problem come here instead of mintty project issue tracker???\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/567#issuecomment-225834756. New default mode is \"persistent selection\", regardless it was started from keyboard or mouse. That is more obvious.\nIf you dislike that behavior - there is new checkbox \"Reset selection on left button release\".\n. RightClick on dialog title.\n. Yes, and that is expected behavior.\n. The reason for on-top is simple: ConEmu's settings dialog is mideless! At any moment one may switch to main ConEmu window to check changes without \"saving\" them. If dialog would not be on-top - it would come under the main window.\n. Seems like it was fixed. 1. ConEmu.xml\n2. LogFiles made on relaunch (when ConEmu goes wrong monitor).\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/Whats_New.html#Build_151015\nMulti-monitor behavior is rather complicated and ConEmu tries to do its best to guess user's desired behavior. If you dislike this AI - you may specify expected monitor with -monitor switch.\nWhat about your logs? Do you think that ConEmuLogs\\ConEmu-gui-4576.log demonstrated wrong behavior? But it started at correct and expected position, because both MouseMonitor and StartMonitor pointed at Primary monitor (00010001).\nMouseCursor: {38,140} MouseMonitor: 00010001 StartMonitor: 00010001\n. @austinwagner You've chosen wrong place for feature request!\nYou have to force Microsoft to do WSL<->console interactions in user mode! Until they are processed in kernel internally - they utterly limit ConEmu abilities!!\n. @austinwagner Regardless the fact Win10 console interprets ANSI itself, WSL subsystem is working in the kernel, it does not write anything to console at all. Complain to MS about it!\n. I doubt a lot in \"hub\" effect.\nPerhaps, project site is much better :D\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=is:issue is:open ConEmu\n. @Kyshtynbai HOW do you ru  WSL?. ConEmu creates proper task for WSL. You don't have to change it.\nWithout explicit examples your description is still unclear.. Nope.\n%windir%\\system32\\bash.exe -cur_console:pm:/mnt\nThis is not the actual default task. Read this:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html#add-default-tasks\nIf course you will have issues with WSL running it using inappropriate way.\nAs for the problem running WSL from proper task via connector... Have you tried it without ConEmu?. What about?\n\nMemory dump was saved to\nC:\\Users\\mark_\\Desktop\\ConEmuTrap\\Trap-160310-5240.dmp\nPlease Zip it and send to developer (via DropBox etc.)\n. Probably related to gh-934. \u0421\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442!\n. \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440?\n. How do you imagine ConEmu would guess where do you want to store the file??\n\nRTFM \n- https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/AboutDialog.html#About-ConEmu.png\n. Writing critical values to registry would break portability. So, I avoid using registry wherever possible.\nDropBox? Google Drive? Yandex disk? Don't you suggest to imlement \"support\" for every client for cloud storage? I dislike the idea.\nA lot of ways are possible\n- Unpack ConEmu to dropbox and enjoy\n- Use -loadcfgfile switch\n- Symlinks are possible of course, but I dislike them\n. @christophla Don't you know that ConEmu by default suggests to place xml in user profile?\n. \n. This feature requires investigation of tmux code. I have to spend time to undestand how it's working.\nConEmu tab architecture supports several tabs per console, the example is Far with its editors and viewers. So, it would be possible to integrate.. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1635#issuecomment-404181835. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. @honzik1 \n1. Guidelines for CONTRIBUTING.\n2. Update to the latest Alpha build.\n3. Describe your problem in details.\n4. Run ConEmu -log, reproduce your problem taking screenshots and saving them to files, so developers may confront them with exact moments in LogFiles. Zip all files, upload them to DropBox or any other hosting and post link here.\n. False, RTFM\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsStartup.html\n. There is no difference between \"normal\" restart and \"restart on update\".\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsStartup.html\n. I have absolutely no idea \"How exactly you are trying to start PUTTY within ConEmu\".\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. Run putty using full path without switches here:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/LaunchNewTab.html#Create_new_console_dialog\n. 5914380\n. I need minimal reproducible requirements (dot files, etc.) Till than I can't be sure about anything.\nAt the moment, I can say\n- It's unclear what vim.exe you are using. I need paths of all executables started in ConEmu tab, you may use ProcessExplorer to examine them.\n- If you run vim from cygwin package - vim does not post ANSI sequences to terminal, unless you are using connector. So the bug must be reported to vim authors.\n- If you run official vim without xterm integration (and seems like it's true, because the backscroll buffer is still enabled), than vim does not post ANSI sequences to terminal. And again, the bug must be reported to vim authors.\n. ## Reporting bugs for Old Builds has no sense!\n. Why do you think that clink have no influence to this issue?\nClink has, and more, issue was filled (and closed) here and on clink project site.\n. gh-563\n. Duplicate: https://github.com/Maximus5/cygwin-connector/issues/10\nVerdict: zsh/fish problem\n. Issue was filled for another project\n. Fixed already, wait for next release.\n. > clink-completions/npm_prompt.lua:11\nConEmu is not responsible for third-party packages.\nFile the issue to cmder.\n. Nobody reads docs, yes?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/GlobalHotKeys.html\n. I need exact steps to reproduce\n. @rjycnfynby I need exact steps to reproduce. What is unclear?\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n. Are you using connector?\nIf don't, cygwin bugs must be reported to their authors!\n. I tell you the bug is in cygwin, but you are insisting?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. Have your read links I posted? Especially https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\nYou're not using connector -> the bug is inside cygwin.\n. It is not an issue with ConEmu ANSI compliance unless you are using connector!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinAnsi.html\n. 1. Screenshots without StatusBar are useless.\n2. Issue is inside cygwin1.dll, babun is just a preconfigured cygwin. Words \"cmder with babun` has no sense. What do you run in ConEmu tab?\n3. There is no issue when you run cygwin properly.. I see no sense in using mintty in ConEmu.\nIssue was closed by topic starter because it was fixed! You must use connector or report bugs to cygwin/msys team, but not here.. No screenshots, no attached ConEmu.xml, I can't help you...\n. I do not see any \"crash\" in the dump. At all. Also, I have no idea what text ConEmu showed to you.\nCan you reproduce?\n. Can you reproduce the problem starting ConEmu64.exe with -log switch? Push here link to created LogFiles and new screenshot?\n. Well, this is reproduced in Win 8. Will check.\n. \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e, \u0432\u044b \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0412 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430\u0445.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsAppearance.html#id2715\n. So, why do you report bugs of these utilities here?\n. No! This is a bug in your tools: git-stats, git-stats-importer!\nThey must not break console properties, or, in other words, they must retain return output console colors were set before they starts!\nHow do you think, for example color -? may work, if cmd would reset console colors on each prompt?\nTwo simple commands to reproduce the behavior on cmd prompt\n```\n\nsetescchar\necho %esc%[30;101m\n```\n\nAnd this is expected behavior, unless you explicitly tell cmd to reset colors on each prompt using Escape Sequences.\n. There are files in /Release folders which are stored in git.\n. You can view current directory in the TabBar. I believe this is more obvious.\n. Do I need to guess how are you trying to paste?\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsPaste.html#id2170\n. Another cmder problem?\n\n. You were warned. It's your shell behavior.\n\n. FYI, to type multi-line command in cmd.exe prompt, each continued line must be ended with ^. And of course, this \"continuator\" is different for each shell.\nAnyway, copy-pasting multiline commands (from websites?) into terminal is very-very bad idea. That's why Ctrl+V do this limited action by default.\n. @aiwebb Your description is so fundamentally unclear that I have no idea what answer to you.... It does matter what console application you run in ConEmu when you try to paste.. Sure. And how do you run WSL's bash?. ConEmu.exe -basic -run {bash}\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. <PowerShell> scheme has specific Text/Back indexes. I suppose that the problem is on your OS, which takes time to apply the values.\nHowever, I do not see any lags on my Win 8.1\n. Hm. Actually, the issue is about popup colors (not simple text, but those which are used, for example, in F7 pressed in cmd.exe prompt).\nSo, you may try to change them from real console window properties manually to compare.\n. What Windows build have you installed? On my test Win10 there is no lag.\nAnyway, I've added some logging to find the problem.\n. It would be interesting to see LogFiles\n. I don't need your settings. This behavior was configured by you or cmder suppliers.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTaskBar.html\n. 1. There is request to support WM_SETTINGCHANGED. However I dislike the idea of automatic updates. Reasons in the issue.\n2. In any events, reaction for this message would not help you. ConEmu must inherit environment of the parent process, otherwise this would rise many crazy and unexpected issues. Especially when running ConEmu as integrated terminal.\n3. The only proper way to \"fix\" that - report the bug (problem, feature request) to AutoHotKey authors. Alternatively - kill AutoHotKey process and restart it from Explorer.\n. Especially on startup, ConEmu must not read vars from registry, but must inherit them from parent process as expected.\nHowever, if (when) vars autoupdate will be implemented, there would be special switch to read vars from registry.\n. Why do you even try to call this??? Where? What do you expect at all?\n. 1. Remove ConEmu64 /cmd from your alias. This looks like \"run new ConEmu window in the existing one but split it in two\".\n2. Examples for aliases are provided in the settings dialog. Even reading of documentation is not required: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsEnvironment.html\n3. $*\n. Docs do not suggest to run ConEmu from ConEmu.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SplitScreen.html\n. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/602#issuecomment-201566081\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/602#issuecomment-201608013\nNo need to create duplicates for issues. Especially for already answered.\n. Discussed what? The answer?\nUse $*.\n. Indeed. Don't you know that Google exists?\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490894.aspx\ndoskey /?\n.

That is strange.\n. You shall not report git-for-windows bugs here. I believe it's clear enough.\nCygwin or msys (which is derivative) doesn't matter. Git-for-windows built on msys.\nAgain. Read the link I've posted before, especially\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. Due to your previous screenshots, you have not run mintty in ConEmu. So your latest comment is very strange.\n. Just configure you desired behavior in settings. Default behavior was changed and new option was created.\n. I believe, smth is wrong with your shell, if you need to clean your directories after shell exit.\nMost proper way to do this cleaning - is avoiding it. Report your problem to shell's author.\nHowever, you may try to trigger some action when ConEmu is closing: Settings -> Far Manager -> Far macros -> Safe Far close\n```\nshell(\"open\", \"cmd.exe\", \"/c do smth here\")\n```\n. Do you start \"Code\" inside or outside of ConEmu? From Task?\nI think more suitable way is creating the wrapper, compiled as GUI (not console) application. The wrapper creates config files and starts \"Code\", and wait intil code terminates. After \"Code\" termination, the wrapper clears the files.\nThis is the only correct way.\n. Moreover, inventing a wheel is not rather good pastime. Simple googling: https://github.com/garethflowers/vscode-portable\n. There's some craziness in posting JSON strings with LF using PowerShell, which I have not overcome yet.\n. The only idea - I can't fix bugs of third-party applications. Why you all, folks, feel certain that ConEmu is responsible for all third-party problems and bugs???\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\nJust run from Win+R the following\ngit-cmd.exe --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i\nRun vim, and say \"Thanks for regression\".\nThis issue tracker is absolutely wrong place to report that!\n.

So, run your console\n  tool from Win+R directly, without mintty wrapper.\nRead more information in the article:\n  third-party software.\n. I'm confused. Do you suggest to reject my version and write your text in CONTRIBUTING.md? What for was your table with dir and ls comparison?\nAlso, running the command from task in Win+R would do nothing in most of cases, because ConEmuDir is not declared in OS scope: \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" .... That also may confuse users...\n. That is already in my RoadMap. Actually, this separation may be very useful for \"integrators\". They may supply updated settings in some base file, which is not changed by user, and user options are saved in their own xml...\nIt's easy to implement loading this user-xml. But the problem is, that it's hard to determine, which settings have to be saved in that user-xml. If user-xml will contain full set of options, than base-xml would become meaningless.\n.

Don\u2019t waste your time reporting problems of Old Builds. Why not to update?\n. I need process dump of \"hanged\" find.exe\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/MemoryDump.html. Yep, March 2017 and there is still no answer to my \"demand\".\n\nboth display line and in the dialog are wrong causing the debug request to error out.\n\nWhat?. There is still neither stack nor process dump.\n. And I don't see any problems with es.exe on my PC. First of all, the issue was created about find.exe hang. And there were no aswers for my requests.\n@hsmyers what process hang do you mean?\n@libichong talks about es.exe which is definitely absolutely different than find.exe and I suppose there may be different problems.\nAnyway, if one say \"process hangs\", it's supposed to be they know what process hangs. There are plenty much ways to know PIDs of processes. ProcessExplorer is easiest of them. And I said many times what information I need to understand the problem.\n\nThe description. What do you do and what hangs.\nMemoryDumps of processes you see in the ProcessExplorer.\nScreenshots (of ConEmu window and process tree from ProcessExplorer) would be helpful too\n. @usrnamatnull my e-mail publicly available in many places, in account properties for example.\n\n\"Undefined\" means ConEmu doesn't force cmd to change output mode.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsComspec.html#choose-preferred-command-processor-platform-bits. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html#update-your-installation\n. ConEmu released with 3-stage manner: Stable, Preview and Alpha . Thought, it must be obvious, that if one don\u2019t want new features\u00a0and bugfixes\u00a0- he may stuck on stable. But it is strange (for me) enough when user reports a bug which was fixed months ago\u2026\n. Just citations from documentation. I physically can't re-type same information for every user.\n. ConEmu do not control the focusing of third-party GUI applications which mintty is. Use bash instead.\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. Can you run ConEmu64.exe -log and attach here LogFiles reproducing the problem? Please describe what pane you have clicked.\n. > Please describe what pane you have clicked.\nHow could I guess what was going wrong?\n. I see...\n. \"Activate pane on mouse hover\" option?\n. Merged: gh-637\n. I accept this as a bug. Even with -new_console environment may be inherited. This is a limitation of the current implementation.\n. Why do you even need to \"start\" new console from another with modified environment?\nThe only workaround ATM is to run ConEmu.exe -cmd <your command> to start new window.\n. These launchers launch mintty usually, which start is not hooked in ConEmu and there is no problems therefore. In other case, I consider these launchers are badly written.\nThere is no way to determine when \"start\" is used. Also why do you think that new window have to be started instead of new tab which is the default behavior with -new_console?\n. Git-for-windows reuses MSys2. This is an answer.\nSo, you may copy appropriate connector to user/bin and replace --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i with, for example, --command=usr/bin/conemu-msys2-64.exe.\n. However, as docs says, current support of 256 colors is limited to bottom working area. This implementation have to be improved.\nAt the moment, disabling backscroll buffer is not a good solution. But you may to put cursor at the bottom on console initialization.\nI have not checked, but echo \"\\e[9999E\" in your profile may help.\n. Is it your question? http://stackoverflow.com/q/36467150/1405560\nI'm not sure. Perhaps the switch -new_console:p1 may help. Add it afer bash.exe -l -i.\n. I have absolutely no idea yet, how \"bash in Windows\" was implemented. But last message looks like a luck of implementation.\n. That all looks like a bash.exe bug. But I can't insist until I check it.\n. @ErrantErinaceinae Are you kidding? Months??? The issue was created four days ago! This is absolutely new feature of Windows 10! It's beta at last and may have bugs!\n. Issue #183 was related to the bug of Docker. The problem of this (#629) issue has not been located yet, but of course it's different, because Bash-for-Windows is absolutely new product.\n. The only workaround: Build 160411 (or higher) and start bash as following:\n%windir%\\system32\\bash.exe -cur_console:p1\n. Disability to type characters with codebase >127 is definitely bash problem. Even chcp 65001 doesn't help. The problem should be reported on BashOnWindows.\n. BTW, what do you think, what name should be given to the task? {Bash::Bash on Ubuntu} is rather long...\n. I suppose that mc, same as vim, requests DECCKM mode, but ConEmu has no chance to know that.\nWell, I'll make another workaround to give user ability to switch keyboard mode manually...\nReally weird, because with cygwin or on native linux terminals, this change is done automatically. But in the current Windows release there is no way to do that.\n. @mainnika https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/629#issuecomment-209482472\n. It does not look like handy solution due to hotkey limitation.\nIf there is a way to force vim to understand, for example, \\e[A instead of expected \\eOA for UpArrow, it would be handy.\n. Generally I dislike chords of keys when simpler solution exists.\nUpdate to 160416, it's expected to be working properly. Just fix your existing task.\n. I suppose it's a final workaround for the current insider build.\nWe have absolutely no idea, what may be changed in the next insider build...\n. Does vim works in Bash4Windows started outside of ConEmu? Have you set xterm for vim term? Have you even change proper vimrc?\nAnyway I have no ideas about vim. Its code is complicated and configuration is entangled.\n. Also, the wiki page is obsolete, has no use in current ConEmu build, and most probably have to be deleted.\nBrowse official website for vim related issues.\n. > Not sure what you mean.

Thanks for the hint\n. > Is it possible to get 256 colors as well?\nIt's off-topic in the issue. Anyway, you should ask Microsoft to change the implementation:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/406\n. When WSL bypassed ANSI to ConEmu, than ConEmu would be able to change keyboard mode.\nI see no sense in discussing the problem at the moment.\n. ConEmu implemented xterm keys emulation long-long ago. When ConEmu detects the flag 0x200 in console, xterm is turned on automatically.\nTo check, one may do simple steps:\n1. Run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}.\n2. Reveal StatusBar column Terminal modes and ensure it shows XA.\n3. Execute in started bash prompt few commands like cd ~ and ls -a.\n4. Try arrow keys, history and navigation are expected to be working.\n. @borgdrone7 are you sure you are running actual ConEmu version?

I do not think this have to be implemented.\nThe option was created just for portability simplification, so, if you want clink binaries to be installed not in ConEmu's subfolder - you may simply use standard clink injection routine.\nBut you are talking about profile for clink. Have you even open the clink.bat? Brief look shows that clink already support specifying profile location via env.var: clink_profile_arg=--profile \"bla-bla-bla\".\nNothing to do with ConEmu at all. Just use env.vars.\n. Have you tried before answering?\nInjecting was removed years ago, because injecting just doesn't work with current clink.\nSo, clink.bat is used nowadays always.\n. 1. If it doesn't work with direct modifying of clink.bat the issue can't be with ConEmu, can it? So you've chosen wrong place to report the problem.\n2. What and where you tried to set and what env.var you tried at all?\n3. At last. I do not see neither version information.\nGuidelines for CONTRIBUTING\n. 1) Obviously, any of start in clink.bat would never work because start runs new console.\n2) Be precise please.\n3) Neither OS, nor clinks versions still aren't specified.\n. You have full control over clink.bat, so I still do not see any use of proposed option and there is nothing to do with ConEmu.\nWell, let me modify clink.bat for you if you can't do this personally:\nhttps://gist.github.com/Maximus5/36c890704691df62f0082b5cbb2968d9\nThis is rude, with debug prints, but working.\nAnyway, this enhancement is for clink only, which you already have requested in mridgers/clink#390.\n. > on upgrade of clink it's way easier to just drag&drop new version without having to think that you've actually modified one of the package files\nYou have already created issue for clink. clink.bat already set variable clink_profile_arg, but clink_x??.exe ignores it. It looks like a lack of clink, but not a ConEmu.\nAnyway, as I've already said, the integration option was intended to be as simple as possible.\nI don't think, that it's good to store extended options for third-party products in the ConEmu settings.\n\nYou have an extra %* that is not needed\n\nAs I've said, the example is rude and just an example. I have no intention to create pull request to clink.\n\nThe other way would be for the app that injects clink (i.e. ConEmu) to be able to pass command line parameters to it.\n\nSure. But what for? If this may be perfectly implemented inside clink.bat? AFAIK clink issue was not rejected yet.\nA few people even know that clink may store profile in the special folder.\n. > It's arguably easier to say \"why can't ConEmu pass a simple command line switch that's already implemented\" because that's the default way command line utilities operate \u2014 by accepting command-line arguments.\nConEmu arguments and switches are intended for ConEmu only.\nFor example, if you would like to run powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted you will not pass -NoProfile and others as ConEmu switch. Instead, you specify full command in proper place after -run switch. And ConEmu.exe -run powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted is both correct and working.\nSame here, if you want to run specific command in your tab - just tell ConEmu what to run.\nOn the other hand, if you want to hold clink in the separate folder from ConEmu, just create %ConEmuBaseDir%\\clink\\clink.bat which will be just a bootstrapper for you \"real\" clink.cmd.\ncall \"folder-with-clink\\clink.cmd\" inject %clink_profile_arg%\n.

Link above.\n\nGvim shows <80>kb\n\nWhat do you mean?\n. > backspace key is working as expected when I run the stable conemu version(150813g)\nSure it was.

Add please exact steps to reproduction with screenshots\n. And have you enabled \"inject ConEmuHk\"?\n. You talk about \"recent updates\". It would be nice to know what build had been broken.\nConEmu do not control conhost, so it can't \"close\" them. Conhost are (used to) terminated automatically when all console processes are closed.\n. Please, try to find broken build. All releases are available here and here.\nConEmu has absolutely no control over conhost. This process is started and maintained internally by OS. So, its parameters has no sense to users.\nThe only thing I can suppose, conhost-s started under SYSTEM account most probably was not spawned from ConEmu consoles.\n. 44d476f\n. ConEmu has no control over icon recreation. It's an MSI work.\nWorkaround in docs: https://conemu.github.io/en/Installation.html#installer\n. If you are using old build, there is big chance that your problem was fixed already. Don\u2019t report problems of Old Builds. Why not to update?\n. Well, what is Brackets.exe? Have you installed it manually? URL?\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTaskBar.html#action-on-closing-last-console-tab-and-cross-clicking\n. > Run bash on windows in coenmu\nHow? Exactly?\n. Also, if it doesn't work in bash, why do you post problem here?\n. I can't magically fix problems in Windows kernel. If it's not working in standalone bash (and it is not), it will not be working in ConEmu.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. Have not checked it yet. It works. You should use connector from ConEmu distro.. Use predefined (by ConEmu) task. It's created for you.. 1. What does it mean \"frozen\"? Show screenshot.\n2. Anyway, I do not believe it's a ConEmu problem. You are running ChildGui application, which provides its own interface and, moreover, it has its own network connection.\nThird-party application problems\n. Still no screenshots.\nI do not believe that the problem can't be reproduced without ConEmu. Again, ConEmu does not interfere with ssh protocol, it just can't.\nHowever, what is the duration of freezes?\n. At last! So, there is no \"freeze\", but wrongly activated ChildGui application?\nHow exactly are you trying to switch tabs, when you get an error?\n. Almost.\nHow do you achieve these two tabs? This is the main question.\nAre they created on startup? Do you run them one by one?\nI need exact steps to reproduce the problem.\nCreate LogFiles and make screenshot when typing goes to wrong console. I need to know the time when that happens to compare with logs.\n. 1. Attach? What for? Just run putty in ConEmu. One step is easier that two.\n2. From your screenshot I do not understand the problem. You type characters and they appears.\n3. I have not asked you about \"when do you run ConEmu\". It's clearly visible in logs. I have asked about moment when the problem appears. Show \"system time\" in ConEmu StatusBar. Than screenshots would be valuable, now they do not depict problem flow.\n. I do not see any problems with described steps.\nHave tried build 160416 x64, but I don't think it matters.\nWell, try the following (as I've tried).\nPuTTY version is 0.63 (official)\n1. Run ConEmu64.exe -basic -detached\n2. Run your first PuTTY instance\n3. RightClick on ConEmu caption, choose \u2018Attach...\u2019 and DoubleClick the PuTTY instance.\n4. Run your second PuTTY instance\n5. RightClick on ConEmu caption, choose \u2018Attach...\u2019 and DoubleClick the PuTTY instance.\n6. Typing (in the second Tab) - works correctly.\n7. Click on the first ConEmu Tab.\n8. Typing works correctly too.\nSo, where is the problem?\nCheck these steps.\n. Perhaps related: gh-625\n. It's all true, however I assume that there is some race condition with activation of ChildGui applications. I can't reproduce the problem on my side, but if you are interested in, it would be nice to do some more logging. Perhaps, I'll find the problem than...\n. But it breaks ConEmu internals.\n. It is because sequence $E]9;12$E\\ is valid and required.\nThe problem of clink is that out does not process properly OSC ANSI.\n. Guidelines for CONTRIBUTING\n.

Vim bugs have to be reported to their authors!\nSame as gh-618\n. Read the link I've posted. All there. I feel this like a Vim bug.\nAlso: Third-party application problems\n. Especially: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#verify-issue-really-originates-from-conemu\n. Roughly. Mintty does not contain \"workarounds\", it just \"emulates Unix terminal\". But you run vim as real Windows console application in ConEmu!\nActually, the suspected bug is not in Vim but in msys2 and you shall report it on the msys2 project tracker.\n. Yes\n. Version of Git!\n. Proper path to the binary is %ProgramFiles%\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe. But it's better to run it via git-cmd.exe.\n. You have set \"Move ConEmu window by dragging client area\" without modifier.\n. Thank you for the report, but you've chosen wrong place for it. I can't fix bugs in Edge.\nDropBox is currupt too, heh?\n\nSignature is properly checked by Windows 10.\n\n. \n. I suppose, Windows SmartScreen has the same problem as Edge. And it would warn on every valid application.\n. Details revealed: MS bans sha1 certificates (which I actually have).\n. Code signing certificates and SSL certificates are completely different.\nhttps://community.letsencrypt.org/t/do-you-support-code-signing/370\n. Try to download latest Alpha.\n. Not hard. Certum allows to reissue current certificate for the same period for SHA2.\n. Duplicate: gh-563\n. Neither ConEmu not Windows (API) knows how to run activate application. It's not an application ar all at last...\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html#create-new-task\n. Any Task (one-command are preferable) accepts additional arguments. Just try to run them from Win+R to be sure.\n. You may easily check the effect of the option yourself by running\nConEmu.exe -basic -run {Show ANSI Colors}\nand playing with checkbox.\n\nAs for your screenshot - the distance between colors make them distinguishable for human eyes.\n. The current implementation uses latest available DeltaE (2000). So I don't think you exact color combination, which you dislike, can be processed by feature. If ConEmu uses larger threshold - entire palette would be affected, which it's not suitable.\n. * https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef\n* https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#contrast-ratiodef\nAnd note about bad experience in the zsh prompt, there should be no contrast triangle...\n\nNormal image, but text is unreadable\n\nThe text: zsh-prompt.txt\n. Please post here link to your ConEmu.xml\n. Can't reproduce. What are you doing?\n. Show your ConEmu.xml. Fixed long ago. What checkbox?. Show the command line of problematic ConEmu instance.\nI do not observe any problems with my latest alpha build.\n\n. We can't move further without this information.. That means you enabled \"Leave in TSA\" option in the Default terminal.\nSo you ask ConEmu \"never close, just minimize to the TaskBar status area\".\nSo the behavior is expected.. Nobody reads docs, yeah?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n. Sure it doesn't. The ConEmuBaseDir is defined on the host only.\nYou may add some set xxx=yyy to bash startup command to pass the variable to the WSL side.. Moreover, the ConEmuC -StoreCWD would not work at all.

There are no consoles yet!)\n3. Create new tab.\nNonsense.\nLearn about -new_console:t:...\n. Guidelines for CONTRIBUTING\nDuplicate: gh-629\n. Why do people think that ConEmu can magically know that is the current directory in their shell?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n. Try %d or %f in the tab bar. Does it updates with tcc's dir change?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTabBar.html\n. That is the question for tcc (authors).\nIf it does not call SetCurrentDirectory than ConEmu can't determine its current directory.\nHave you \"Inject ConEmuHk\" enabled BTW?\n. What do you mean? 32bit tcc/le or V13 are working properly?\n. From ConEmu point of view there is absolutely no difference between 32bit and 64bit shell.\n. I suppose, that associations would be better. Open .js files in Idea, .cpp in Sublime and so on. Isn't it?\n. 9336a7c\n. ConEmu do not do anything with WSL.\nUnless mouse is working in standalone BashOnWindows, you chose wrong place to report your problem.\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues\n. 1. What shall I see in this one-frame png file?\n2. ConEmu does not, never had and never will execute commands. Forward problems to shell's authors.\n. Indeed, ConEmu forwards all input to console application. If you see path in the ConEmu, that means your console application received path input.\nAnd ConEmu do not execute the path or anything else, so the problem is somewhere outside of ConEmu responsibilities.\nThere may be dozens of causes. Try ProcessMonitor to find your own.\nAlso, further readings: https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. Do you really think this is a proper report??\n. DirectDraw will not magically fix the lack of SetConsoleTextAttribute.\nEven with ANSI codes you can only set single-strikethrough attribute (not supported in ConEmu)\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8357203/is-it-possible-to-display-text-in-a-console-with-a-strike-through-effect\n. 1. DirectWrite may be used for painting. It has nothing with console API. Absolutely. Don't thing that change of renderer magically bypasses console API limitations.\n2. ESC[4;31m has different implementations. Yes, in ConEmu it's used for background intensity.\n. Complete selection. Of course, you can't input anything until selection present.\n. I see. Actually the selection is present (you may see that in the StatusBar) but mysteriously vanished from screen.\nI accept the bug.\n. Use either -reuse or -new_console. Birth are documented\n. You are trying build from year 2015. Obviously it can't be actual preview build.\n. What is that mysterious vcbuildtools.bat? If it runs hundreds of processes you have to wait a while.\n\nwhich is in the past, can it still be a preview?\n\nI do not understand your question\n. Sure it can. But disabling injects is never recommended. Do you want crashes? I don't. And I'm not going to receive these crash reports.\n. On my non high-end machine I have 0.98s outside and 1.25s inside ConEmu.\nVery small lag, isn't it?\n. > A terminal that actually affects the execution time of it's software is an outrageous concept to me \nThere is no way in Windows to implement descent terminal which does not inject detours library into running processes. Obviously, superfluous code always takes time, doesn't it?\nConEmu does its best to make these lags as small as possible.\n. > Which doesn't answer why I'm seeing such significant lag on a relatively high end machine\nYour PC is six time faster than my )\nIf you want to investigate further, I'll ask you to do some logging:\n- Settings / Info / Debug\n- Check \"Shell\" radio, don't clise dialog and execute your batch.\nSave logged data to file and post here link (use DropBox, gist or pastebin).\n. > I can confirm, this issue does not exist in ConsoleZ\nOf course it does not. ConsoleZ has very lightweight injection system, only root process is infiltrated. Therefore nothing of advanced features (via injection) would be working in all spawned processes.\n. Perhaps the bug of MsMpEng.exe (which utilized your CPU) was fixed.\n. > but when run NodeJSPortable.exe \nThe main questions are \"where\" and \"how exactly\"?\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/LaunchNewTab.html#Create_new_console_dialog\n. What does that mean?\n\nDisable Settings -> Keys & Macro -> Multi-line paste\n. At last. You are on \"Paste\" page, but not on \"Keys & Macro\".\n. Windows 7 Taskbar Jump Lists were implemented years ago.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTaskBar.html\n. RTFM: chcp\n\nConEmu is unicode application, don't change settings if you don't understand what they are designed for.\n. If your app works in usual console, it works in ConEmu. Because ConEmu reuses usual console.\n. RTFM. For example\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\n. What? Xterm256 is supported for years.\n. Absolutely the same in ConEmu: Text and Back. What's the problem?\n. Due to the limitations of conhost it's not possible at the moment. Only \"paletted\" text color is supported.\nBackground color you may try to change on the Background page, like \"Ubuntu\" predefined color scheme dies.\n. BTW, anyone may choose arbitrary color for background.\nThe text color is upon console application, e.g. you may configure your prompt. Related to gh-227.\n\n. Didn't understand anything\n. Until you explain what are you doing, what is \"console in background\" and other details, I can't say anything concrete.\nAt the moment I can only suppose that you are using DefTerm feature improperly configured.\n. Actually, I'm planning to implement list of allowed commands (using masks or regexps).\n. 1. 150522 - really?\n2. Take ConEmu.xml from working PC and compare it with bad one.\n. You have two instances of ConEmu plugin?? Use ProcessExplorer to check.\n. Do you have ConEmu and Far both installed in same folder?\n. It's a magic :D\n. Just rechecked and still do not see any problems. What I'm doing wrong?\nClean install of latest ConEmu + Far, start it with ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {far}.\n\n. @no-one-at-all  LogFiles and Screenshots please. Screenshots before and after the problem appears. StatusBar must be visible.\n. The build 150813g is crazy old. Three years? You are kidding.... First of all, you may run ConEmu.exe -log and reproduce the problem. After that, look for the SetOtherWindowPos in the ConEmu-gui-...log.\nConEmu shows what it \"suggests\" to child app.. Was the close accidental?\nNo, StoreNormalRect skipped - is OK. But other lines are suspicious.\n22:49:46.094 VCon(0x0008041E).OnSize(1920x969)\n22:49:46.095 SetOtherWindowPos: hWnd=x00090706, hInsertAfter=x00000000, X=-9, Y=-38, CX=1938, CY=1016, Flags=x4010\n22:49:46.095 SetOtherWindowPos: hWnd=x00090706, hInsertAfter=x00000000, X=-9, Y=-38, CX=843, CY=813, Flags=x0004\nI have no idea why the window is resized to smaller size immediately.\nI'm interested in call stack or dump at the moment of bad call. Are you familiar with debugger?. First of all, how about current preview build?. Please redo logs and screenshots to continue.. Are you kidding?\n1. You show on screenshot png file but tell me it's an ico?\n2. RTFM: -new_console:c has absolutely different meaning! http://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html#syntax\n. Git-for-Windows problems have to be reported on their issue tracker.\nThird-party application problems\nAnyway, you didn't show screenshot or PS1.\n. > Repairing ConEmu seems to fix the issue.\nWhat?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. > Repairing ConEmu seems to fix the issue.\nand\n\nI'm speaking about the \"Repair\" options in the ConEmu installer. I've attached a screenshot because a picture definitively beat a long text that is not read or misunderstood\n\nIt's hard to believe. And it's hard to understand you. Is the issue fixed or not??\nAnyway. Repairing (MSI) is doing only one thing: it rechecks all ConEmu binaries and restores proper versions, if they mismatch. And the same installer can't install wrong versions of binaries. It just has not other versions inside than proper ones.\nSo, I do not believe that it's a ConEmu problem, but seems like smth on you PC slow down ConEmu somehow.\nRe-check and describe what happens with binaries, updates and slow-downs. Also, downgrade to proper version (160504?) and re-check it.\nAt last, try to run ConEmu.exe -basic -run {cmd} and try to create tabs and switch between them. Slowdowns?\n. There were no changes in the interprocess communication.\nStill waiting for confirmation of previous builds behavior.\nAlso, what about CPU usages of ConEmu and spawned processes? Use ProcessExplorer to check.\n. @princemaple And I don't believe that the problem is not reproduced in the RealConsole, when your git's bash is started outside of the ConEmu.\nThird-party application problems\n. There is no \"raw git bash\". What exactly do you mean by this??\n. I can not do anything with MS antimalware service. Complain to MS about it...\n. @princemaple Screenshot is not an answer, unfortunately. What terminal it is? What exactly do you start?\n. @glhez So, do you experience this problem with Norton antivirus? Or MS only?\n@princemaple I didn't understand. Have you tried to rollback ConEmu version? I suppose the issue is not related actually to ConEmu updates.\n. It's practically impossible to add all possible GuiMacro to default hotkey actions. Users may define desired hotkey to any arbitrary GuiMacro.\nI'm not going to create special hotkey/action for recreate w/o confirmation. However, it's possible to add confirmation settings.\n. If you are using old build, there is big chance that your problem was fixed already. Don\u2019t report problems of Old Builds. Why not to update?\n. 1. Third-party application problems\n2. Show RealConsole, scroll it and type there.\n. ConEmu \"proxies\" conhost.exe. Powershell.exe, cmd.exe or even a Bash.exe are Console Application which ConEmu may run inside.\n\nhow to run Bash in ConEmu\n\nJust run it. Or open Tasks and just press \u2018Add default task\u2019. The task \u2018Bash\u2019 will be created for you.\n. Ref: https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/417\n. ReSharper\ngh-96 of course\n. I will try to check this.\n. I need at least screenshot of ConEmu when crash message appears.\nAlso, it would be nice to have LogFiles and the crash dump, if you are able to reproduce.\n. Screenshot with StatusBar visible (Console visible rectangle, Console buffer size, Cursor information).\n. BTW, I see two dialogs, another one under the dialog with Exception message. What shows that another dialog?\n. @afffsdd What do you mean??\n. @AndrewFFF Can't find the problem yet... Can you manage to reproduce the crash with this debug binary? If so, please redo logs+dump upload.\n. @afffsdd 1. The debug binary was not suggested for you. 2. That binary is obvious patch for latest preview version and will not work with old ones. 3. Why do you post selection problems in crash issue???\n. @afffsdd I do not believe. From your screenshot, you've tried to \"patch\" very old build 150629. So, why do you talking about 160522? Also, you have not provided your LogFiles, CrashDump and Screenshot. Screenshot of the crash, of course. The image you've provides is not a crash. It's a note about bad binaries token from different builds!\n. @afffsdd I've already requested: LogFiles, CrashDump and Screenshot\n. So, what about 160605?\n. It is not so hard to search for \"start\" in the Settings, isn't it??\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsFeatures.html#id2740\n. Looks like plugin is not loaded\n. Ah. You have unchecked \"Far windows\" in the TabBar settings.\nIcon is displayed only for the \"first\" tab, which is Panels. Editors and viewers do not have icons, that's by design.\n. Absolutely wrong patch. It does not take into account confirmation option!\n. Nice!\n. Ligatures support and more - in plans.\n. Not yet. I have long todo list.\nLigatures don't have priority. To be implemented, all ConEmu graphics have to be rewritten using interfaces. Than it would be easy to use any other API, e.g. DirectDraw, instead of GDI.. BTW, there is the branch br-gdi where some work is done.. There is branch https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/tree/br-gdi where I make from time to time required changes.\nIn brief: all gdi calls in ConEmu code have to be moved to special classes like CDrawObjectFont.\nAfter that it would be easy to implement new layer running on DirectWrite or even OpenGL :). I've created a draft issue gh-1608 where I will post the progress. It? What?\n. From your description I have no idea what exactly do you want.\n. Use search before posting!!!\n. gh-629\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. Why do you ask here?\nYou compare working command in bash.exe and not working command in cmd.exe. Moreover, different commands!\nI do not see any problem with running working command in ConEmu.\n. You don't.\nFrom your quotation, you try to run cmd.exe in ConEmu.\n. I mean, your description is missing some critical things at least\n. > edit: when I run the python command directly from cmd.exe instead of git bash, then it works fine also\nIt's hard to believe. Show screenshots how do you run it, in all variants.\n. 1. So, what is the problem?\n2. Why do you think the problem is in ConEmu?\n. - You screenshot is cropped. I don't see sizes of console and terminal emulation mode.\n- Show comparable screenshot of mintty.\n- Check with ProcessExplorer that you are running same ssh.exe binary.\n. Please enable \"Terminal modes\" column in StatusBar\n. They the same from your local cygwin bash prompt. If less (local) works properly, then the problem is with ssh.\n. Why do you close all shells? Just minimize ConEmu.\nConEmu does not run any task on restore, because user may want to run non default task, and it would be ugly to force user to: run new task, switch to prev tab, kill unwanted shell.\nPerhaps, if you want to run some shell, you may set up shortcut (on desktop, for example) to run your shell.\n. 1f2960e Internal. fix memory leak (2dee092 regression)\n.

Anybody knows about \"search\" at all??\nDup: gh-719\n. I need exact characters which overlaps.\n. @AndyScull What is your OS? Show info from ConEmu/About/OS.\n. > DBCS: 0, ACP: 1251, OEMCP: 866\nAnd how do you imagine ConEmu would fit your string in non-intended console space without shrinking???\nYou have two options: either install CJK OS or do not use CJK.\n. > why does the same happens on complete japanese windows installation?\nThe same? I doubt. Show screenshots of ConEmu and RealConsole on DBCS system. And issue chcp in that console, what codepage it shows?\n\nThe same way ConEmu v 141221 did. \n\nPreviously, ConEmu trims glyphs which overrun intended rectangle. Just compare screenshots. I'm sure partially displayed text is worse than compressed one.\n. This looks like a bug of Far Manager.\nOn DBCS enabled systems, CJK takes two cells instead of one. AFAIK Far ignores this fact and it's an issue for Mantis.\nWhy your long string is displayed condensed in ConEmu I'm not sure. Depends on exact glyphs location in console. Seems like Far tries to fit data which exceeds panels size. And ConEmu do its best to fit bad data...\n. I can't understand why do you prefer cropped content.\n. OK, more reasons and description\nIn your own example, you have really long text in your console\n\nConEmu can't do any magic. It shows in virtual console the data console application printed. Lets take WinWord for example. Would you like if the text you typed goes out of page margins? What happens if you send this doc to printer? You would have only half of the book, which has absolutely no sense. You can't guess what was in the cropped text (which overruns page margins).\nWhat would happen, when you try to copy this cropped string (old ConEmu behavior) from console? Doesn't matter, with Far's grabber Alt+Ins or ConEmu internals Copy. The behaviour would be weird. You try to copy something which does not exists on screen.\nWell, some fun below:\n\nWith old behavior, when overruns were just dropped (cropped) you got that\n\nAnd you just didn't see infomation which may be valuable\n\nOn DBCS enabled OS properly designed console application knows, that CJK takes two cells and does not try to print more data than possible. Far was not designed for CJK, thats why I've suggested you to complain on Mantis.\n. 1) You are wrong. If the bug would be fixed in Far, it would print the following\n\u2551\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u306e\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308b\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u691c\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u691c\u7d22\u6a5f\u80fd \u3092\u6d3b\u7528}Folder \u2551\nThan you would be able to scroll long names as usual in Far with Alt-Left/Alt-Right. For example\n{\u754c\u4e2d\u306e\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308b\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u691c\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u691c\u7d22\u6a5f\u80fd \u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057}Folder \u2551\nThat behaviour of console application would be absolute proper and ConEmu would not crop/drop/whatever any parts of text. And there would be no overlaps too.\n\nNow, tell me, which line of information should be tagged as 'cropped'?\n\nYou can easily see that part on the left. You have no idea at all that after \u3057 there is long string \u3066\u3001\u304a\u63a2\u3057\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044. This data was cropped/dropped/hidden/...\n2) I show you part of the status bar. There are no vertical bars, text is printed as one continous line. It's not correct to point on the one example, without mentioning a lot of other variants.\nLook. I do not tell you that current implementation is ideal. ConEmu just does its best to show what console application asks to show.\n. DBCS versions of Windows works absolutely different than non-DBCS.\nWhen you run application on DBCS Windows and use double (four) byte codepage (like 932) each CJK takes real two cells. Take a look at COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE and COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE in CHAR_INFO description. This is absolutely weird and unbelievable on first sight, but actually this is the only way to print and display CJK using [A] console functions. Moreover, even if console application uses [W] function (like Far does) to write wchar_t sequences, the console doubles each CJK (first will have COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE and second - COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE flag) and you have this glyph in TWO cells, otherwise [A] functions will fail to read 932 codepage!\nThe only exception is codepage 65001. It uses one unicode (wchar_t) real cell.\nThe console window (conhost.exe) and ConEmu known about that and display sequence of cells (COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE ... COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE) as one CJK glyph.\nSo, when you are using CJK Windows, console applications must work in different way than on non-CJK Windows.\n. >  If so, it can fit width/2 characters for any given range of cells on virtual console screen. And there will be spaces, like when I enable monowidth in ConEmu\nSo, you are wrong here. There would be no spaces. Only CJK glyphs which are (unfortunately) doubled in conhost internal buffer (taking two cells) but are displayed as one wide glyph.\n. Simple test in CPP coming\n1. Obtain current cursor position\n2. Write two unicode glyphs L\"\u4e16 \" (CJK + 0x20) using WriteConsoleW\n3. Read three wide chars from cursor pos (from step 1) using ReadConsoleOutputW\n4. Go crazy :(\n. I'm preparing tests and screenshots. Later today...\n\nConsole should use monowidth font for those, \n\nWhat do you mean? On DBCS system \"monowidth\" font has different width for double-width (CJK, full) and single-width (just ASCII) characters.\nPS. Is it possible to discuss in Russian to avoid translation problems?\n. Here are some tests: https://github.com/Maximus5/Write-Read-Test\n\nhow many characters would be shown in 60-cell wide tab in DBCS, and non-DBCS windows.\n\nRealConsole (conhost.exe) physically can't show more than 30 full-width glyphs in 60-cells console. They are folded to the next line otherwise. Each CJK takes two cells in any case on DBCS OS.\n\nAnd how would they look mixed with ascii characters?\n\nExactly as they must. ASCII (half-width) would take single cell.\n\nAnd how many characters would be seen in ConEmu window?\n\nSame as in RealConsole. There would be no compression at all, because all glyphs would take desired space. On DBCS OS of course.\n\nAnd consider it all with non-monowidth font...\n\nArial? Times New Roman? Tahoma? Awful... regardless CJK or not.\n. If you think output nay be improved (looks like so), reopen the issue and put here the file/text where problem occurs.. I don't think the issue is actual in current ConEmu builds. Option \"Compress long strings to fit space\" exists for a long time.\nThere is no sense in using old builds. Isn't it better to ping the issue?. @TGhoul So, do you prefer to lost completely the tail of the string in favor of CJK not clamping together?. As commit message states. The 160619 is working properly, just checked.\n. Have you read commit message?\nShow your Paste settings.\n. Well, ConEmu may check for paths, if clipboard does not contain \\n.\n. To be sure, what is 283-ko-grid...?\nWhy it's centered in last version?\n. It would be nice to know, how to configure zsh prompt. Or maybe you are using standard zsh prompt?\n. I have oh-my-zsh installed. What shall I do next?\n\n. Can you please do Dump screen... and post here links? SystemMenu/Debug\nI'm interested in those lines, where symbol > exists and [time] or branch is shifted from the right to left.\n. It's user responsibility to close all ConEmu instances before they run MSI installer. ConEmu tries to detect other instances to warn user, but due to some circumstances it may fail. Anyway, neither MSI nor ConEmu can do \"update\" if files are locked.\n. > or close all of the console windows which worked with the previous ConEmu version.\nThis would not work. Windows update binaries only after reboot.\n. ebd10ab\n. Ask FarTeam to show progress in console title.\n. How do you think, what would be easier and even more proper?\na) implement in ConEmu all COM possible interface versions of ITaskbarList and intercept all possible ways to instantiate them.\nb) make 3-line change in Far Manager to get deletion progress act same was as copy/move behaves?\nNote 1. ConEmu is a terminal, I don't want to implement any of TaskBar features, there is Explorer and Windows desktop.\nNote 2. Deletion progress is not visible in Vista and WinXP even if Far is started without ConEmu.\n. Seems like you didn't understand.\nDoes Far show deletion progress in the console (progress dialog) or TaskBar (standalone)? If so, it will be three line change to show progress in the console title.\nIf Far can't show progress, why do you think ConEmu magically can do it?\n. Doesn't that mean Far know progress value?\n. There are switches already. What do you talking about?\n. \n. damn smartphone autocorrection\n. Show you problem\n. 1. Open Settings and search for \"CPU\".\n2.

ConEmu does not capture PuTTY output. It physically can't. So, that is weird to complain PuTTY problems here...\n. > It is not a PuTTy issue.\nReally? Why do you think so?\n- PuTTY is not a console applicaion\n- PuTTY paints and communicates with servers itself only (has its own drawing and communication routines)\n- ConEmu can not and does not intercept secured transfer between PuTTY and server or \"output\" of PuTTY\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\n. >  Next time I'd be better off saying I type a char and 4 seconds later is displays\nI thought ChildGui article clearly states the ConEmu does not do \n\nsuppresses the display of the PuTTy window and intercepts the I/O to PuTTy session and displays it on ConEmu console window/tab.\n. Actually, your issue is about nothing. So, how can I answer? Details, please.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. No details? You do not care about that? Strange...\n. All WSL processes are working in very elevated mode. ConEmu has absolutely no control over them.\nYou may ask Microsoft to do smth with that, but I'm almost sure its impossible by design.\nFor example, issue https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/406 still has no answer.\n. Who creates the xming.exe process (process tree)? Who creates xming window? What is relation type window/process (one to one, many to one)?\n. ConEmu allows knight one ChildGui window per process. Moreover, it's impossible to auto-attach abstract windows. Xming windows are definitely abstract because they are not spawned from any ConEmu children's processes.\n. WSL processes are out of ConEmu control. Ask Microsoft to change implementation.\n. * https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n* https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html.

Yes. But this has to be fixed.\n. @sasos90 ChildGui has limited functionality. RTFM.\n. Thank you for report, I'll examine dumps today.\nHowever, I don't believe it's a ConEmu problem, it's an application working in user mode and might not cause kernel crashes. Perhaps it's new Windows bug. What build you are using now?\n. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560129.aspx\n\nBug Check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL\nThis indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.\nCause\nThis bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. This is usually caused by drivers using improper addresses.\nThe error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.\nIf you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.\n\nAs I've said before, ConEmu is user-mode application, it is not a \"driver\" and it can't \"manipulate\" IRQL.\nCheck your hardware and drivers.\nPerhaps detailed information about crash (check Event Viewer) may give you a clue.\n. From dump analysis\n\nBugCheck A, {26c, 2, 0, fffff800234dc1b9}\nProbably caused by : dxgkrnl.sys ( dxgkrnl!DXGADAPTER::ProcessComponentIdleList+157 )\n. ConEmuPack.7z is packed without any passwords or encryptions.\n\nAre you sure you are using proper 7-Zip?\n. What version of 7zip do you try?\nIn my tests there were no problems.\nAnyway, the original issue was about \"password\" and also was not confirmed.. Please try to download manually current and previous release installers (from releases section).\nTry both in manual upgrade mode (standard MSI wizard).\nThat is strange, may be changes in chocolatey, because ConEmu installation scripts (MSI and nuget) weren't changed.\n. Craziness...\nCan you run ProcessMonitor to track what happens when hang occurs?\nHave you checked CPU utilization by processes? That may be a problem of antivirus software (updated recently). ProcessExplorer.\n. BTW, ConEmuSetup doesn't run Ruby...\n. Do you mean this foreman?\nhttps://github.com/ddollar/foreman\nHave not tried it.\nI can only say, that installer was not changed since last build. Try to psexec previous ConEmuSetup to be sure...\n. Installer is a bootstrap for MSI.\n1. It unpacks msi and cab to the temp folder (is ConEmu.160707 created in user local temp dir?)\n2. It runs msiexec.exe with arguments, passing temp msi package.\n3. Waits for msiexec termination.\nIn theory, ConEmuSetup may show error message box if some problem occurs, but I'm almost sure it must not do that in automatic mode used by choco.\nLook at process tree in ProcessExplorer, use ProcessMonitor to check process activity as I've suggest before.\nAlso, you may unpack msi+cab manually (run ConEmuSetup /? for switches) and try to emulate (psexec) the problem by starting msiexec.exe directly, without ConEmuSetup.\n. No, ConEmuSetup.exe is saved by choco in system temp. But msi+cab are extracted to another temp dir, returned by GetTempPath API function and creates there new unique subfolder ConEmu.XXXXXX, where extract files.\n. In my case, files are located in c:\\users\\name\\appdata\\local\\temp...\nYou may easily check that by running ConEmuSetup manually.\nAlso, files are expected to be removed after ConEmuSetup exits.\n. Has it ever been working before?\nI suppose, GetTempPath returns bad inaccessible dir when running under system account.\n. New version behaves different way. What is the process tree at \"hang\" state?\nAlso, new version creates log file on problems, check tge dir where ConEmuSetup.exe is located. Want to see it.\nNo sense to create msi packages, I have already three different packages, two more?\nWhen I've checked on my PC, there were no problem while installing from System account.\n. What is the \"halt\" you mean?\n. Third-party application problems\n. Please read the article I've posted.\n. It's not quite clear, are you Far Manager user or not?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFarPlugin.html#ConEmu\n. You are using old clink build.\nThe clink's problem was fixed long ago.\nhttps://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/384\n. ANSI sequences are generated by custom cmd prompt. Old (current release unfortunately) clink builds had/has issues with it.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#Compiler_error_highlighting. reason: gh-723\n. I suggest to discuss the change in gh-723. I do not use neither Quake nor AlwaysOnTop features, so discuss please the feature with parties concerned.\n. Merged\n. You've reported git-bash problem in the wrong place!\n. What if you run cmd.exe outside of ConEmu and execute chcp 65001? Does you console window (native) shows your folder name? Show screenshot and paste the name here to be sure.\nTo go further I need versions numbers of all.. You should check latest alpha, if it's working.. Why do you ask? ConEmu \"supports\" any Windows console application. Moreover, Bash4Windows is working in ConEmu. And almost all problems (do you even expect any?) have to be addressed to Microsoft.\nThe article is deprecated, but I post the link:\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. If you are talking about ANSI support (issue 111) I'm not sure if it is even possible to fix in WSL...\nBut, may be request (with a lot of votes) on UserVoice would give the problem more weight.\n. > I've also noticed that it makes the console take longer to open up.\nCompared with what? Without MacType installed?\n. So, the delay is MacType problem, don't you think so?\n. Why do you think, that checking for MacType produces the delay?\n. At the moment - no.\nI can add check box to suppress print warning (if you are talking about this), but trust me, delay of {GetModuleHandle + printf} is so small, that I can't understand how do you measured it.

I didn't understand you. Don't you want from ConEmu to fix bugs of Keepass2? You've reported the problem on the wrong site, I'm not a Keepass author. Ask them to support applications running in ChildGui mode.\n.

ConEmu itself should not be run as Admin.\nYou may want to save few clicks in UAC confirmation, but this is potentially security problem.\nUser choice.. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsMouse.html#id1542\n. Please read this: ChildGui\nConEmu does not \"pass\" anything to ChildGui. Child window either has focus or has not.

RTFM: http://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n. That makes sense, I'll take care about it.\n. At the moment, when ConEmu attaches any RealConsole, the colorscheme from that console is always used.\nThat may be critical for applications started outside of ConEmu, but of course looks like a limitation for Far's detach feature.\n. I don't like the idea: ChildGui. Sure, smartphone.... I didn't say \"it bad feature\". I'm going to implement it in ConEmu.. @pyhedgehog I dislike mintty started in ConEmu.\nAs for your points\nThe escape sequence already exists: ConEmu specific OSC.\nCopying solution from mintty is impossible. mintty doesn't work with real console as ConEmu does. So mintty doesn't face the hell of synchronization between its internal buffers and real console ones.\nAs I said, scrolling shortcuts will be implemented.\n. @jasir What exact bash of dozens of its implementations you are trying?\nHint: http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinAnsi.html. Yep\n. At the moment - no. But it's possible\n. At the moment ConEmu doesn't support fonts-per-console, so I don't see much sense in the feature request. May be I future\n. Version?!

So, if you want to fix it, you shall provide information I've requested.\nThe links to docs are in your original post in the \"Additional files\" section.\n. Appreciated. But without log files made on your side I physically can't find the problem.\n. Screenshots and screencaps are very helpful in any case\n. 1. Cmder is a bundle maintained by other authors.

Is not possible until ConEmu internals would be completely rewritten.\nI'll have this in mind.\n. > After following this guide I can't seem to find a way to specify a startup directory for bash.\nThis guide is just a disclaimer. The main idea is \"just run bash.exe in ConEmu tab\" and \"report problems to Microsoft\".\nAFAIK you may pass startup directory as an argument to bash.exe, for example, \"%windir%\\system32\\bash.exe\" /mnt/c/Users. Anyway, that is the question for https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows, but not ConEmu.\n. \"/dir\" is ConEmu's switch. It uses standard Windows paths, e.g. \"c:\\Users\".\n. @afinnell What's the reason of your solution? In ConEmu startup directory for WSL works seamlessly without any -c cd ....\nIf you want to run wsl from your own application, you just need to specify startup directory for wsl.exe.. @adorkablue What was the purpose of your post?\nThe {Bash::bash} is created in default ConEmu tasks (was implemented long ago).\nThe issue topic tells us \"Specify Startup Directory\" and you may do that seamlessly in the same way as with other tasks.\nAnd I don't undestand how powershell function zsh is related to the issue.\nP.S. cmder parameters are not related to ConEmu.. I see absolutely no sense in cmder, especially if you use WSL. Cmder is just an additional layer of software, which may introduce unexpected effects.\nCmder.exe is a loader for ConEmu and the cmder bundle includes ConEmu, clink, mingw and other stuff.\nWhat for if you already have is don't need them ?\nYou didn't even know that ConEmu itself supports WSL from the box for a long long time add haven't any problems with startup directories.\n. @13ck015405 Bad advice.

Arrow keys workaround was implemented few months ago in ConEmu.\nThe bug of WSL (arrow processing) was documented, posted and accepted by MSFT (issue link is above).\n\nI do not see any problems with arrows on my test Windows 10.\n. Actually \"particular\".\nTry this:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ConEmu.exe -basic -run {bash}\n. Don't mix WSL and other subsystems issues. Docker is not a WSL application!\n. @paulodeleo \n\nBut they do work with the same test when using cmd or RealConsole from cmder.\n\nReally? Cmder is ConEmu. So your problem is not a ConEmu problem, but rather the way you start the docker or your docker configuration!\n. What can I say, anyone may be hacked.\n1.

Sure. Just \"Recreate active console\".\n. But you have to choose new task\n. http://conemu.github.io/#Disclaimer\n. I do use D&D regularly and have not seen the problem.\nCheck for properly installed Far plugin first.\nDescribe what do you try to drag and how.. \n\nCheck for properly installed Far plugin first.\n\nUse ProcessExplorer to view loaded DLLs in Far.exe. Especially for ConEmu.dll.\nTry clean Far without third-party plugins.\n\nAlso the error often appears during closing conemu window.\n\nThan it does not relate to D&D?. 1. Do not create duplicate issues.\n2. It's not a ConEmu problem, but Windows bug.\n. I wonder what was the expected action?\nIf you update existing ConEmu installation, it must be obvious that you already have these files in the directory. So \"renaming\" would cause unwanted duplicates.\n. You should extract archive with directories.\n. > When I click or drag the header of cmd\nWhat? I need thorough description, LogFiles, Screenshots...\n. Look, to fix the problem I have to know exactly what is it...\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/CrashDump.html\nWithout crash dump it's impossible until I can reproduce it on my side. But I can't reproduce, no crashes.\n. Fixed long ago by f37cd90. 1. Show RealConsole and put focus in it.\n2. Press Ctrl+/.\n3. Describe result.\nHave you read information in the head of your issue??\n. > in RealConsole, I hit Ctrl+/ but nothing happens. I typed few characters and typed Ctrl+/ and nothing happens as well.\nThat is the answer. If your console application doesn't react on Ctrl+/, why do you think that ConEmu would fix the bug or config problem of the console application?\nAnyway, I wonder, why haven't you deleted spare information from issue top?  You are not the first person who haven't done it.\n. You just run wrong executable.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/GitForWindows.html\n. Multiple alternative fonts are in the RoadMap. Can't predict implementation date, but I have that in mind.\nAlso, I've tried automatic font selection feature (no glyph - ask the FontMapper for substitution), but it was failed for some glyphs...\n. What is the problem?\n. Why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\n. Both xshell and securecrt are not console applications.\nConEmu doesn't support remote connections, and I don't plan to implement any. ConEmu is local terminal.\nAll remote access work must be done in the ssh client. Which do you use?\n. As I said before, ConEmu is local terminal. ConEmu is neither server nor remote client. Anyone may use one of dozens of console remote clients (ssh and telnet are most known examples).\nSo, all bugs of remote access problems must be addressed to these clients authors.\n. Current ConEmu versions does not advance cursor backward, if you clicks above the prompt.\nIf you click below the prompt (but that is not your case), the fix is pending: ref gh-1213.. Duplicate. Use search before post.\n. This issue was not created for WSL originally.\nUnfortunately, applications may behave differently in ConEmu and standard Windows console. And there may be dozen of possible reasons.\nLinks\n- https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/13817#issuecomment-250174897\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. > 1.12.2-rc1\nWhat do you mean?\nReporting Third-party application problems here would not have any effect. ConEmu is not responsible for them.\n. Docker has special branch in their code, which Docker uses when it see \"ConEmu\".\nSo, it's improper to compare with native console behavior.\nConEmu can't fix Docker problems.\nAll I can do - hide from Docker \"ConEmu presence\", but it's bad approach of course.\nAgain. Go to Docker tracker and contact their authors.\n. In Unix there are two styles of Arrow keys representation. Seems like Docker stuck to one and forgot about other.\nThat's not a ConEmu problem, ConEmu doesn't send xterm input sequences to Docker at all.\n. Using ChildGui with enabled transparency usually raises dwm utilization.\nI consider this is not a ConEmu problem.\n. @tni What OS you are using? Versions? LogFiles with high CPU consumption?\n. ConEmu doesn't \"output\" anything. The broken output is produced by buggy console applications you are using.\n\nUsed shell version : cmd\n\nReally? Cmd doesn't support splitting.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. ConEmu is terminal. It just displays what console apps wants to print. If console app prints garbage, you see garbage.\n. http://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. RTFM\n\nThird-party application problems\ncygwin/msys connector. ConEmu is not a magic tool to fix Third-party application problems.\nI constantly post links to cygwin/msys and cygwin/msys connector.\nBut users continue to push here cygwin/msys bugs. Why?\n\nPoor documentation? Do you mention cygwin docs?\nConEmu's docs are open-source and anyone may contribute to make them clear and obvious. But where they are, contributors? The author physically can't explain some trivial things because they are trivial, at least for the author.\nConnector bugs? Report them at last! Words \"it's full of bugs\" are senseless.\n. At last, almost every option in the settings dialog has a hint explaining what does it do. Unclear? Ask and suggest hint improvement. Yep, no contributors again.. Do F-keys work if you run WSL outside of ConEmu?\nIf they don't work - no workaround is possible.\n. In the StatusBar there is \"Terminal modes\" column.\nLClick on it, for WSL there must be \"XTerm\" option selected.\nAlso, there are two modes of keyboard encoding - try both of them by checking/unchecking AppKeys.. 1. ConEmu build?\n2. Your task contents?\n3. https://conemu.github.io/en/KeyEvents.html. How did you run your bash?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html\nFrom your keys log we can see that F-keys are received by your Unix console side properly. So the problem is not in ConEmu I believe.\nAnyway, update to preview or alpha is recommended.. Coz you didn't tell me about your bash task contents, I strongly recommend you to run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash} using latest alpha vection.. @cbuchacher Your cmd issue is offtopic here. This issue describes the problem of Windows Subsystem for Linux.. @journey-of-code Try to change TERM to xterm.\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe -t xterm --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt\n. 180416?. * https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. Duplicate. Moreover, it's not a ConEmu bug. Just Docker tries to operate with Windows console without console API.\n- https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/25578\n- https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/13817\n- https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/25475\n. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20docker\n. ConEmu registers set of keys in registry. You may try to reg-export and than reg-import them. All keys are under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\n- HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\shell\n- HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\Background\\shell\n- HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\shell\n- HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Drive\\shell\n. ChildGui\n. Show the \"Terminal modes\" in the status bar. Attach the screenshot.\nI suppose, that it's a python bug, incorrect use of WinAPI.\nConsole doesn't allow to put cursor after the EOL without LF.\nYou may try cygwin/msys connector, if your python is build using cygwin/msys libraries (I doubt).\nAnyway, it's not a ConEmu problem.\n. What is python2.exe? Full exe path? url of installer?\n. This is not a bug of connector.\nIn fact, this is the problem of xterm emulation over conhost. It's not possible in RealConsole to put cursor after end of line, the cursor goes next line immediately and automatically.\nConEmu tries to hack this issue, but your case was not processed yet.\n. What about build 170305?. I didn't understand your question.\n. You can.\nEither \"Auto save/restore owned tabs\"\nOr create a Task (do you know about them?) and filling it with \"Active tabs\"\n. The answer depend on your case. Why do you click? What is expected reaction for the click?\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsMouse.html#id2344\n- http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsMouse.html#id1542\n. Why do you report vim bug here?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. 1. No sense. User may run two, three, four... tasks in one window. Why do you close \"first\" tab? \"First\" from which task? No sense... However, you may switch to certain tab and close it before starting new task. Perhaps you haven't described what do you want really.\n2. \"Write command\" is ambiguous. Paste? Execute? Echo? Whatever else?\n. > close a tab with a command?\nDo you mean \"active tab\"? Look into GuiMacro Close.\n. Sure. Read docs (all there) or at least reveal full command issued by you.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/GuiMacro.html\n. Docs, docs, docs\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html#syntax\n. I need LogFiles and fullscreen screenshots \"before\" and \"after\".\n. Just launch Bash from ConEmu!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. Why do you report adb/nano bug here?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. Please attach descriptive screenshots: before nano, with nano, after nano.\nStatusBar with Terminal Modes and console rect must be visible.\n. I can't check that at the moment. Just two notes.\n1. By default ConEmu does not show valuable for troubleshooting columns: \"Terminal modes\", \"Console buffer size\" and \"Console visible rectangle\".\n2. I can't believe that the same problem can't be reproduced from cmd.exe started outside of ConEmu.\n. Your link to nano is invalid (Invalid Attachment specified).\nVersion of adb.exe was not specified.\n. I consider this is Microsoft bug. Please report it there.\n. - https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. - Third-party application problems\n- Bad Issues\n. Just look into \"Size and pos\" settings page!\n. ConEmu does not shift anything without demand from user or application (Far/EMenu in your case).\n. 1. ConEmu does not support strike fonts yet.\n2. As this page mentions, Italic support is limited.\n3. Anyway, I doubt that git post ANSI sequences to ConEmu at all. Most probably (however I can't guarantee that without check) git process all console attributes internally and uses WinAPI to display text. If so, italic/strike would never work because of git limitation.\n. I have done some checks and realized that it's possible to use connector to get ANSI from git. However, strike fonts are not implemented yet in ConEmu and there's still a limitation for lower part of the buffer.\nBad news: to implement support of extended console attributes I have to rewrite a lot of legacy code.\nGood news: as stable version was released I plan to do a lot of breaking changes when I have time.\n. Download ConEmuSetup.160904.exe and try to run it manually.\nSomewhat unexpectedly blocks its execution. ConEmu is not responsible for that. Perhaps OS, group policy or Antivirus software harms you.\n. ConEmu does not intercept any of internet protocols.\nI suggest you to report this to Kitty authors. I don't think debugging of Kitty is my duty.\n. Thanks for the information. That definitely looks like MS Windows bug.\nCan you confirm your Windows build number?\n. There is nothing to fix in ConEmu. Your problem is related to Win10 insider updates.\n. - Both KiTTY and PuTTY changes their process acl to avoid any external manipulations. So it's normal that non-elevated ProcessExplorer can't read KiTTY process information.\n- ConEmu runs KiTTY absolutely the same way as, for example, Notepad. And you may easily view environment of Notepad started in ConEmu.\n- As I said before, ConEmu doesn't catch any of internet related functions, so all questions must be addressed either to KiTTY authors or your antivirus software if you use any.\n. Look. I said more than a time, contact KiTTY authors! Only authors may answer questions about their product.\n. 1. I do not understand \"runs too slow\". Your words are too ambiguous.\n2. Even that, why do you think it's a ConEmu problem, instead of cmder/git/whatever?\n. > automatic quarantine process have flagged keyboardHook dll files found in ConEmu\nWhat exactly they ban and what exact reason they provide?\n. The article mentioned by @jdunn0 describes the purpose of ConEmuHk.dll and unrecommended way to work without it.\nAlso:\n- https://conemu.github.io/search.html?q=conemuhk\n- https://conemu.github.io/en/FAQ-2.html#q-2-4 (especially)\nWorking without ConEmuHk may be a real pain. I think best solution is \"contact your administrator\".\n. And ConEmuHk.dll has nothing in common with keyboard hooks.\n. 1. What exact keys have you pressed?\n2. I need LogFiles reproducing the problem.\n. > 180206\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. https://conemu.github.io/en/AltNumpad.html. And what? There is \"ANSI and xterm sequences\".\n. Wiki may has obsolete name of the option.\nOn your screenshot I don't see columns\n- Terminal modes\n- Console visible rectangle\nAlso, show your \"Colors\" settings page\n. Right click on the StatusBar and turn on\n- Terminal modes\n- Console visible rectangle\n. Anyway I think you've missed critical limitation:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Xterm256Colors.html#xterm_256_color_mode_requirements\n. You may try to run your task with switch -cur_console:h0.\nOr you may fill your console on startup (profile script) with empty lines to reach the bottom of the buffer.\nThat limitation came from old/legacy code.\n. Well, I'll fix it.\nBut why do you want to leave ssh-agent running after ConEmu exit?\n. Than, where do you store and initialize SSH_*** environment variables?\n. In fact, everyone is using stable build at the moment.\n. Didn't understand your problem.\n. Why do you think it closes? Have you checked your taskbar notification area?\nIt was you who asked ConEmu to hide to TSA!\n. @adawolfa Hard to believe... To realize the problem ineed LogFiles, your Settings (ConEmu.xml), and video if possible.\nAre you sure the ConEmu icon doesn't exist in TSA?. I need LogFiles and screenshots demonstrating what are you trying to do.\n. Is the problem actual in the current build (it's now 190303)?. I don't understand the question.\nOption to hide title bar exists for years.\nEven the screenshot was created without title bar.\nSo?. Win 8.1\n\nWin 10\n\n. Open Settings/Info and look at performance counters during keypressing. Show screenshot.\n. Without tests I can suppose that\n- terraform detects that it was started in ConEmu and does something wrong (bug in terraform). \"Started in ConEmu\" means T. thinks that current terminal behaves differently than conhost.\n- well, I can't exclude possibility of a bug in ConEmuHk.dll, but I'm pretty sure ConEmuHk is not guilty in your case. You may try to uncheck \"Inject ConEmuHk\", but if you'll see output in that case, most probably it will switch T. to standard branch of code and hide probable bug.\n. Try this\nConEmu.exe -basic -run PowerShell.exe -noprofile\n. Hotkey Win+Q is configurable.\n. It doubt it's a ConEmu problem.\nYou may attach VS debugger to your console application when it hangs and examine the bottleneck. I suppose it's related to some network activity. But ConEmu does not hook network functions of console apps.\n. 1. The debugger started in \"Native\" mode would show you actual WinAPI call executing at the moment. And you can see call stack at that moment. I suppose it's not a ConEmu problem, so ConEmuHk would not be located in the call stack. If not (one of ConEmuHk functions in call stack) it would be a reason for further investigations. Unfortunately only you can check that.\n2. Check for ConEmu.xml in user profile and HKCU/Software/ConEmu key.\n. HKCU values are used only when:\n- you have selected registry for settings storage on first ConEmu start\n- setting up DefTerm feature\n. Disabling \"Inject ConEmuHk\" is very bad approach. Feature is described in docs: https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html\nThere is very small chance that \"Suspended\" state is caused by ConEmuHk bug. Certainly, your process is started in suspended state to inject WinAPI hooks, but ConEmuHk resumes your process immediately after that!\nSo, your lags most probably are arisen by your anvirus/antimalware software. What do you use?\nActually, to debug this problem I need to see at least call stack of process which starts this \"Suspended\" process.\n. As I said before I need information about two processes: your application and its parent process.\n. Anyway, I suppose the Trend Micro (which is tmmon.dll) raises conficts with ConEmu in your system. And I suggest you contact them. Reasons are simple:\n- only you have license to use this product and you have legal ability to contact their support;\n- only ConEmu has open-source codes and anyone may contribute to impove smth, but Trend Micro is closed source proprietary software.\n. @OverlordQ Read the issue for questions. Nobody can help without thorough information.. First sight: when you run smth from jump list, your parent process is \"explorer.exe\", but not \"ConEmu.exe\". So, your started process inherits environment from Explorer.\n. Screenshot!\n. Expected behavior. You've created xml file in the protected location. ConEmu does not update them.\n. ConEmu does not create xml file in protected locations. It just can't.\nBut if you start it first time as administrator, or if you have previously disabled UAC, than in the only that case, ConEmu may suggest installation path as one of possible locations for xml file. User knows better what they want, don't they?\n. Move it to %APPDATA%.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html#search-sequence\n. I suppose it's either configuration problem: https://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\nOr ssh bug: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n. > it only fails when I run the ssh under ConEmu, if I do it from a regular windows (git-bash) terminal it works\nThat's not true. Read this: https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n. OK. Then please try the following:\n1. In bash started in ConEmu show RealConsole and try to type accented characters in both windows.\n2. Attach (Win-G) bash started outside of ConEmu. Type in ConEmu window. Is it working?\n3. If there is a difference, please show screenshots of Settings/Info for both tabs.\n. 1. Are you sure you have changed focus to RealConsole while trying to type accents? RealConsole has OnTop flag and one may \"type\" in ConEmu window by mistake.\n2. If you show attached RealConsole, accents aren't working in both windows?\nWhat git/ssh version you are using? \n. Thats why I mention same conditions of fair comparison. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html#stand-alone\nI believe, if you execute \"chcp 65001\" in standalone prompt and execute ssh - you'll get the same problem without ConEmu. Than it's obviously an ssh bug.\n\nEnvironment gets executed even when I attach external consoles?\n\nHm. The commands from Environment are executed by server. Server is started on Attach. Chcp and alias commands has per-console effect.\nI'm not quite sure if it's correct and expected behavior.\n\nworkaround for when I need chcp utf8 \n\nYou found it. Is it working?\n. Is gradlew a jar-file? Than it's not an executable and you have to \"process\" java.exe.\nWithout example of output of gradlew and chcp (what cp you are using?) I can't be sure what do you need to set. I suppose following may work\nset ConEmuCpCvt=java.exe:65001:850;\n. > ConEmu: 10914 x64/x32\nWhat??\n. Anyway, I think it's newly introduced Microsoft bug.\n. I suppose you have not updated all ConEmu files properly.\n\n. Please do the following\n1) Run bash using following command (from Win+R for example)\nConEmu64.exe -basic -log -run {bash}\n2) Reproduce the issue with doubled CJK. Make screenshot. And Dump screen contents using system menu item in Debug submenu.\n3) Post here link to created files.\n. I suppose all \"problematic\" computers are not DBCS-aware installations Win10. To check\nConEmuC -checkunicode\nAnd the tool would show SM_DBCSENABLED=0. \n. Please show output of ConEmuC -checkunicode\n. > However if I use any of the other tasks (even the same bash task, if I launch it via another Macro hotkey), it starts in my Windows user profile directory (that is the value of ConEmuWorkDir)\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html. Do you want to start two or one tab?\n. I don't know what's inside your {venv} task, but I believe you may setup it with studio in one line.\nNothing to improve in ConEmu.\n. You do nothing in {venv}\ncmd.exe /k\nSo, all what you have in {venv} you have in {vs2015} too.\nSo I can't understand your problem.\n. I need crash dump.\nBad Issues\n. Also, if one knows about discussion (any breaking changes), it would be better to let the authors know to. Don't you think so?\n. I don't see any crashes on ConEmu + Far 3.0.4774\n\nyou mean Far Team?\n\nNo, I mean this site. I'm not obliged to monitor all third-party software changes even they relate to ConEmu.\n. ConEmu does not care about Far's history length.\nIt's possible that crash occurs on certain console contents, but without example I can't fix it.\n. I need more explicit information.\nIt would be nice if you can send me or Far Manager .db file with your history entries. And screenshot when ConEmu crashes.\n. Is it reproduced in 180418?. 1. How you you run Far?\n2. Is ConEmu plugin of proper version is loaded into you Far?\nI'm running Far 3.0 build 4949 and CD is detected properly.. Is ConEmu installed in the C:\\Program Files\\Far Manager\\ folder?\nDo you see ConEmu ... items in the F11 menu?\n\nWaiting doesn't help, but if I press any key, or even move the mouse over the tab, it updates.\n\nEvery time?. So, this looks like a bug in Far Manager - sync call still doesn't work until something comes into Far input queue.. I've done whatever possible. There is no way to get panel folders synchronously.. First of all you should search for TH32CS_SNAPTHREAD instead of CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.\nYou'll see very few cases which are conditional. Generally speaking, enumeration of threads would be called on Win+G only AFAIR.\nTo check the bottle neck you can simply run the following\nConEmu -basic -log -run cmd /D\n. And post link to LogFiles here\n. I use my fork of minhooks, it doesn't use CreateToolhelp32Snapshot\n. Hm. It's possible though\nJust add empty string value with name \"Extended\" to your created items. E.g.\n[HKCU/SOFTWARE/Classes/Directory/shell/ConEmu here]\n\"Extended\"=\"\"\n. Default shortcuts are pain for me. There is no scheme fitting all users.\n. You misunderstood the meaning of DefTerm!\nThe feature allows users to run children console applications in ConEmu automatically.\nBut you are talking about creation of console window in existing process / existing GUI application.\nYour app was already started outside of ConEmu and perhaps created some visible windows, doesn't it?\n. Ok, I'll fix it\n. And why do you post this here?\n. When I execute, for example, from Far's command line (outside of ConEmu of course)\nC:\\tools\\7z.exe a -r test.7z *.*\nFar always starts cmd.exe. But you insist it doesn't. What I'm doing wrong?\n. First if all, you have not said what do you want to change.\nIf my guess is correct you need this:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/GuiMacro.html#SetOptionID\n. > I was able to get some of the ANSI codes recognized by manually reading data from console screen buffer using ReadConsoleOutputCharacter and then printing it to stdout.\nDo you mean \"disable 0x200\" and read raw ANSI already written to conhost (RealConsole surface)?\nIf so, that's wrong approach. Image what would happen with coordinates during your \"conversion\".\nAlso, this method would never be \"real time\".\n. LogFiles\n. Use Far /w. I can't fix Windows bugs.\n. This is correct and expected behavior.\n. It is.\nConEmu is terminal developed to start console applications.\nWhen you run expected application, there is no \"garbage\" output.\nBut when you run GUI - things become complicated. To avoid ambiguous behavior of ConEmu, it shows to user what happens with their applications.\n. 1. You said \"161009\", but it's not clear if the error appears in that build or existed before? Try previous ConEmu build.\n2. The phrase \"open git bash\" is undistinguished. What do you run exactly?\nThird-party application problems\n. > it's not clear if the error appears in that build or existed before? Try previous ConEmu build.\n. 161009a\n. Dup: gh-896\n. I do not see the loop of \"Close all consoles, active console, and Cancel\" dialog.\nWhen I press Cancel - ConEmu does not show the same question.\n\nPlease attach your settings (xml) and post here screenshots of confirmation dialogs..

RTFM, no?\n- WslBridge\n- Pass ANSI Escape Sequences up to the Console\n. BashForWindows is so special that it has its own page in the documentation. Easy to find.\nI spent a lot of time writing them and it's unpleasant to see that users do not look at it.\nInstead of sarcasm it would be much better to suggest improvements to docs. The link exists on every page.\n. OK. Consider this as translation problem of non-native speaker. Sorry for misunderstanding.\n. No, you don't. As docs state, true-color support is limited yet.\n. > sometimes when I start a console, arrows are not working\nWhat do you do? \nAnyway, the solution you mentioned just tries to force proper mode, which user may turn on manually any time. This also described in docs\n\nAlternatively, you may enable StatusBar column \u2018Terminal modes\u2019. LeftClick the column and select \u2018XTerm\u2019 and \u2018AppKeys\u2019 when tab with Bash on Windows is active.\n\nDefault {bash} task doesn't uses wslbridge because it is third-party product.\n. I'm aware of it.\nWhen I finish with stable (severel TODO in my list) I plan to refactor the console server.\nIt's a pain for me (as developer) because I have to sync in realtime conhost contents and true-color attributes.\n. As docs explains, current ConEmu build limits true-color support to the bottom of the buffer.\nThe 9999 was written at the moment when ConEmu default backscroll buffer height was 9999 lines. So in fact the number should be the same as the long buffer height defined in your ConEmu settings.. First of all, ConEmu doesn't set TERM at all. So your description is at least incomplete.\n- Bad Issues\n- Third-party application problems\n. \u0432\u044b \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c\n.

It's processed by Windows to open \"Devices\" charm. So, it's a bug in the third-party software, that is can't handle it.\n. By design. For example one user disabled title bar, tab bar, status bar... And asks - how to revert them? I can't open settings dialog. And here you are: few hardcoded hotkeys.\n. No. The key meaning of predefined hotkeys is that they are always available.\nXml may be bundled with modified keys by third-party party integrators. This breaks the meaning.. \nSo, your only complain is inability to set your own hotkey to open settings dialog? But you can!. \nI can't add all possible combinations of actions to configure hotkeys. But with Macro user may set almost any possible personalized set of actions )\n. 1. Open Settings dialog\n2. Use Search field to find the \"title\".\nWhat can be easier??\n. If you posted this information when you created the issue, then the answer would be absolutely different: https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n1. The documentation reflects actual build or tries to do that.\n2. If the user asks obvious question without description what they've tried already, what do you think the author can suppose?\n3. Again. Old Build! Even if there was a bug, why user can't suppose it was fixed long ago?\n. My responses were neither impolite nor helpless.\nThe template of the new issue asks from user important information and when user just ignores this petition I'm a little disappointed.\nAs for your current request, I have no idea if you updated your installation or if you suffer from the problem on current version.\nI don't think I need to look for the problem in the old build (restore sources or install it) because it is deprecated.\nAs for your bold text, it's ambiguous. And that usually means the user overlooked the option.\n. Perhaps \"User screen transparency\"?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTransparency.html\n. That usually means something bad happened with conhost.exe.\nCan you reproduce? Than attach LogFiles please.\n. 2 all\nI need more information to reproduce the issue.\n\nWhat are you doing exactly?\nShow screenshots with status bar visible of course. I need at least these columns: Terminal modes, Console visible rectangle, Console buffer size, Cursor information, Console server PID.\nI need all LogFiles created by this instance of ConEmu.

Third-party application problems\n. RTFM: http://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n. 1. Just Delete old bad version.\n2. Docs are here: conemu.guthub.io, conemu.ru is a partially translated mirror.\n. Look. In your screenshot ConEmu explicitly shows you where is old bad version is located. I haven't suggested you to reinstall ConEmu.\nLast line in the message! ConEmu files located outside of ConEmu installation folder? Isn't it obvious?\n. 1. If it is not obvious for you it would be better to suggest obvious message.\n2. Again. ConEmu updates only itself files. Files copied by user somewhere on disk (outside of ConEmu installation) wouldn't updated automatically.\n3. Sad that you ignored my messages several times. User must not copy ConEmu files outside of ConEmu installation. If they do that, they (like you) come here to ask your question.\n4. This is NOT a bug.\n. Documentation is available for push requests also.\n. > In your screenshot ConEmu explicitly shows you where is old bad version is located. \n\nLast line in the message!\nJust Delete old bad version.\n\nWhat is unclear? How these words can be more obvious? Are you kidding?\nConEmu uninstaller does not remove user files which is ConEmu.xml located in the user profile folder.\nMoreover, reinstallation is not required, as I told you many times.\nDo you see the large button Add default tasks... on your screenshot?\n. Screenshot please. I don't know the moment and reason when your cursor changes.\n. 1. It is restricted to Far\n2. There is an option already. On the \"Far Manager\" settings page.\n. 1) Why do you talk about the WriteConsoleW? Have you checked the result in the RealConsole by Ctrl-Win-Alt-Space?\n2) Please run from ConEmu's prompt ConEmuC -checkunicode and show result here.\n. @miniksa Can you take a look at this? Reported already several times here.\n. Perhaps this comes from changes in attributes processing. I noted some time ago (not sure where exactly) that new Windows build process high byte of console attributes \"in proper and better way\"...\nOne of the most weird things in conhost is COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE/COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE processing. It works differently on DBCS (Chenese/Japanese/...) Windows distros than on \"European\" distros. On DBCS systems, when certain CJK codepages are selected, each double-width glyph takes two (or more?) CHAR_INFOs (cells). That never happened on European distros, even if CJK support was installed and these codepages were selected in the console.\nI can't reproduce this issue on my test Win 10 boxes yet.\n. @miniksa Finally I managed to install insider build.\nFirst, the expected behavior from \"stable\" Win10 build. All glyphs are written and displayed properly, no doubled CJK and data properly fit on screen.\n\nNow the 15014.\n\nI'm still checking the results, here first notes.\n\nRegardless the fact SM_DBCSENABLED is 0, COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE and COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE are set. Is that intended on non-DBCS enabled OS? There were not used previously, only CJK versions of Windows (up to Win 10 14393) used them.\nMore worse that even conhost treats CJK glyphs in different ways.\nSomewhere it shows them (by squares, yep) supposing they have double-cell width, somewhere - single-cell width.\nWhen ConEmu writes 80 characters (the console width) on non-CJK Windows, the data is expected to be written properly without wrapping. But that's not true anymore. Even in conhost's window we may see that only 77 characters (I counted them) were written under the frame (the line with three CJK glyphs).\n\nFinally. Here are drawing bugs during selection in conhost's window. I selected one by one cells with mouse. Cells have unexpected width during selection. And strangely the line below the selection is broken during selection.\n\n. @miniksa Inconsistency of API... WriteConsoleOutputAttribute, WriteConsoleOutputCharacter, ReadConsoleOutputCharacter, ReadConsoleOutputAttribute, ReadConsoleOutput...\nSome of functions treat CJK as normal single-cell glyphs (WriteConsoleOutputCharacter, ReadConsoleOutputCharacter).\nSome of functions return COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE/COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE and therefore double cells (ReadConsoleOutputAttribute, ReadConsoleOutput).\nSome of functions has undefined behavior (after WriteConsoleOutputAttribute and further WriteConsoleOutputCharacter glyphs are \"written\" after filled with attributes cells).\nIt's all on non-CJK insider Win 10.. I used to check GetSystemMetrics(SM_DBCSENABLED) which actually was 1 only for Windows installations developed for China, Japan, Korea (CJK).\nIf SM_DBCSENABLED returns 0 that meant that CJK glyphs use only one cell in conhost, regardless of the codepage.\nThat was true before.\nNow it is broken or changed.\nWhat is correct behavior?. That means that your winbox somehow restricts from acquiring files from it. It would be better to contact its authors.\n. D&D is rather complicated and its documentation is weak. I doubt I can fix the problem (if it exists in ConEmu indeed) without ability to debug.\nHowever, it may be interesting to see LogFiles when you reproduce the error.\n. Have you checked the settings?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTabBar.html#id2599\nAnyway, each console has an index, so you can activate the console by number, not \"tab\". Tab may contain several consoles (split/pane).\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/MicrosoftBugs.html#BrokenText\n. @Ashkin This is by design. If you want to save font changes - change font in settings. There is the option for the font height, no sense to use temporary zoom feature instead of proper option.\n. Follow \"guide\" (you have not said \"what guide\") step-by-step to get proper results.\n. And the page tells where you can get connector: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html\n. What if you add -dir C:\\test to the Task parameters? Any changes?\nShow the contents of the C:\\test folder?\n. Please don't use external picture hostings. Github can embed them nicely...\n. I see.\nTry to replace conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t with wsl-con.cmd -run. Specify full path to cmd file if required.\n. That's due to limitation.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#xterm_256_color_processing_requirements\nYou have to scroll the console to the bottom of the buffer. The section :do_run in the cmd file is doing that. So you may either copy these three lines top your own cmd file and run it in Task or do the same echo in your bash profile and run connector from the task.\n. Adding the line echo -e '\\e[9999H' into the .bashrc might work.\n. Haven't you read my messages? That is limitation. After ctrl-l you'll lose 24bit colors.\n. Note 1. ConEmu buffer may be greater than 9999 lines (current maximum is 32766). So some users have to change these numbers.\nNote 2. Vim switches buffer to alternative mode which does not have scrolling. So all works from the box in Vim.. ConEmu can't be \"fullscreen 720\" on \"monitor 640\".\nI don't understand you.\n. ConEmu can't asks must not change the resolution of the monitor. It's a terminal, it adapts its size to resolution changes. So the answer is \"no\".\nHowever, I didn't understand what happens on your last screenshot? Doesn't ConEmu stay in fullscreen mode? There is strange gap at the bottom of the screen.\n. What?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n. > I want is It should open the following way In the edito not separate window\nThis is you question at last? So why you ask here for a feature of VS Code???\nConEmu inside allows third party developers to integrate ConEmu inside their applications. Obviously this work must be done by this third-party application authors, but not me.. Assertions are not crashes!\nAnyway, I need exact steps to reproduce because it depens on some race conditions in Microsoft's conhost.exe.. Dup: gh-934. Please report this top Docker team\nThird-party application problems\n. It would be an error in ConEmu, if Docker acts absolutely the same way in ConEmu as in raw conhost.\nBut it does not!\nBrief look into issues will prove that!\nDocker true to determine ConEmu presence and behave differently.\nAgain. Report to the Docker's team.\n. Why do you think that you can run admin consoles with asterisk?\nDocs do not offer that.\n. This is offered for task contents only.\n. Have thinked over the issue.\nThe checkbox in the \"New console dialog\" have the priority.\nWhen you run the normal task, user may check or uncheck the box to change starting behavior.\nSame as with \"admin\" task. The checkbox can't be set in the \"indeterminated\" state, so the \"uchecked\" default state has priority over Task contents.\nYou may just run you admin task by hotkey to run it unmodified.. Read docs! I spent a lot of time writing them and I'm upset when users ignore my work.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SplitScreen.html. Really? So please teach me how to write docs.\n. Haven't you even try to search in the issues or docs? It's a pity...\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/953. > If I change the Background its also changed for Powershell. Why?\nWhere you tries to change \"Background\"? And why do you think it must not be changed for any other applications running in ConEmu?. > I dont like the prompt and would like to have the normal $P$G.\nConEmu may be configured for any taste.\n\nWhy this isnt possibe via settings?\n\nAnd what you have tried? Have you seen the contents of the {Cmd} task???. Perhaps you should learn how to write .NET console applications instead of reporting invalid bugs.\nThe Console.Write never writes CR/LF implicitly.\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/system.console.write.aspx. http://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html. Tool? You have to use .NET functions properly instead!. What? Your application does not break the line. Why ConEmu must break the line if your application doesn't do that?. It's not a problem.\n\nUsers expect when they run smth1.exe the terminal shows output of the smth1.exe without changes\nUsers expect when they run \"smth1.exe & smth2.exe\" the terminal concatenates their outputs without changes\nUsers even may run smth3.exe in the middle of the prompt to write text without changes\n\nThat is correct behavior.\nWhat do you want? Again,  Why ConEmu must break the line if your application doesn't do that?\nIt's your application duty to output linefeed at the end of its output.\nIf you dislike cmd.exe behavior, that it doesn't start the prompt from new line, I really can't understand why you come here instead of knocking to Microsoft?\nThird-party application problems. To check the ConEmu:\nConEmu.exe -basic -run cmd.exe\n\nAnd try your hello.exe\nConEmu is a terminal! It just displays what console applications print. ConEmu never adds any linebreaks self willed.. If you dislike the behavior of some console application (which you run in ConEmu) you should contact this console application author.\nThat may be either clink or cmder (because cmder is a bundle of ConEmu+third-party stuff).. Rather strange. Usually that means that binary mentioned in the last message line is obsolete.\nAre you sure that C:\\Admin\\tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\ConEmuHk64.dll is up to date?\nAnd check the contents of the C:\\Admin\\tools\\Far30b4242.x64.20150117\\plugins folder. Perhaps there is a ConEmu subfolder with obsolete plugins?\nIf neither of above suppositions is true, you should check all binaries loaded into Far.exe process. Use ProcessExplorer to do that.. Asterisk is not defined as \"run command as admin\". Docs never state that.\nDon't confuse command line options with special Task prefixes.\nRTFM. Especially that: http://conemu.github.io/en/LaunchNewTab.html#Create_new_tab_from_existing_one\n. Rejected. Command line is executed \"as is\". And there is already ways to run elevated tabs.. fixed. * http://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n* http://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html\nThis does not relate to ConEmu. The npm uses wrong encoding, which you (or its author) have to fix.\nPerhaps simple chcp 65001 would help.. http://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html. The call is not listed in supported commands, and it would never work on the Environment page.\nAll commands here are executed by ConEmu directly and are shared for any shell started in ConEmu.\nThe call is executed by cmd.exe explicitly, the batch may call any external applications, and it has no sense here.\nIf you want to load your aliases from cmd (why? all aliases may be configured here) you may run your batch from the Task.. What application (language, bitness, debugging options) you are trying to debug?\nWhat have you configured on DefTerm page?. Also, it would be nice to see the process tree (from VS & ConEmu) with full command lines.. Something like this. I'm interested in processes (ConEmuC) spawned by Studio. And their command lines of course. Process Explorer\n\n. ConEmu is based and implements all features of RealConsole.\nThere is no proper way to\n determine if the line and actually all thouthands of lines below it are \"empty\";\n limit initial scroll buffer to visible area.\nIt you have some brilliant idea how to implement this properly - share it.. \nIt's not a PowerShell.\nWindows console is implemented in that way!\nAbsolutely all Windows console applications share this behavior.. Think of Windows console as two dimensional array of char+attribute. API allows to change and read any cell of this sheet. . @BrenBarn Do you know how many API functions Windows provide to console applications? I can rephrase your suggestion: just write new Windows kernel.... Read this: Bad Issues. You have selected wrong project.\nIt's not a ConEmu, you are using cmder config.. What actions do you need really? ConEmu default RClick behavior is most user-friendly in comparison with any terminal I know.. I believe, that bad behavior would not be implemented in ConEmu. I consider the RClick menu is bad behavior. Moreover RClick menu has no sense at all.\nThink about several possible situations, what do you expect from menu?\n\nthere is no selection, there is text in buffer\nthere is no selection and clipboard is empty (rare)\nthere is active selection, there is text in clipboard\nthere is active selection and clipboard is empty (rare). @dnut You can set right click to open the menu. Almost all hotkeys in ConEmu are configurable. So your requested features are already implemented.\n\n\nConEmu's default RClick behavior is the least user-friendly in comparison with any terminal I know.\n\nThat is your opinion. On the contrary when I see any other \"user-friendly\" terminal I realize that they are not so handy as ConEmu. IMO.. As I said in my previous comment - in hotkeys\n\n. First of all, you are running cmder.\nYou must check your npm in bare ConEmu instead, with default settings.\nUnpack latest ConEmuPack.7z in some new clean folder, run ConEmu -basic and try to reproduce.. The goal of the project - reliable and fast terminal.\nThere are many other todo-s with higher priority.\nSo, at the moment - no.. Just use Notepad, what's your problem?. Please fill info by issue template. Have you even read what you have posted?. RTFM: http://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html. Please search through issues between posting duplicates!.

[Maximus5/ConEmu] Mouseover Alters ConEmu Window Size (I #1000). Yes, it is. Trying trello to put my todo in order.. How about current preview? Things were changed. Different things. User may set up any number of \"ConEmu here items\" and its absolutely unfriendly to lock them to startup task. Use named tasks instead.\n\n\nctrl+shift+e and ctrl +shift +o also open cmd if current focused window is cmd.\n\nUnclear\n\nonce click intergration->Unregister, the intergration form inputs would be all clear, have to restart ConEmu\n\nNo. As I said, any number of items may be registered and user may just modify something in the command to register one more item.\n. By default, ConEmu suggests {cmd} -cur_console:n as command. Googling is not required to change {cmd} to any desired task. Anyway, docs page explain details. I plan to show docs link at every page in future.\n\nAbout ctrl+shift+e and ctrl +shift +o, the shortcuts to open a new splited pane\n\nSo what? You described the current behavior.\n. Decided to close this issue.\nBy default, ConEmu suggest {cmd} task and user may change it to any desirable.\nAt the bottom of the page there is hyperlink to docs, no googling is required.\nAlso, changing editbox to drop-down restrict users from any modifications of command line, and I don't like the idea to put here (on the simple settings page) dozen of checkboxes to cover all options.\nIf anyone know how to improve docs, there is a link at the bottom of each page.\n\n. What does the tip message tell you exactly?. The tip shows you two actions assigned to one hotkey.\nIsn't it obvious that you shall correct one of them?. \nThe tip contains three lines: key, desc1, desc2. If you suggest smth, please be more precise.. Shall I guess what or not have you configured in ConEmu?. Why do you think ConEmu shall use some other font instead of selected by user (you) in settings?. I've tried to use automatic font mapping provided by Windows, but it's slow and buggy, only certain characters were mapped. So, at the moment, only manual configuration is supported.. @Tacsy What you are talking about? You already has configured alternative font on your screenshot. But I see no sense in choosing the same font as main. And I don't see any problems on your prompt screenshot.. You said \"git bash is broken\". So, you chose wrong site to report the problem.\nThird-party application problems\nHint: you have to convince git bash to process unicode properly (aka UTF-8).. 1. Read the link I posted.\n2. The screenshot you posted is not \"git bash\", it's the mintty.exe. What you named \"git bash\" is a bootstrap for mintty.. What is the sense to reporting bugs of a year old build?\nUpdate to preview at least.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. 1. Have you read this: https://conemu.github.io/en/VimXterm.html#Vim-scrolling-using-mouse-Wheel ?\n2. Vim version numbers are about nothing. What build you are trying? Where you have downloaded it?\n\nIs it possible to view the raw ANSI from the mouse?\n\nThere is no simple answer. KeyEvents may show RAW ANSI input but ConEmu may change keyboard/mouse translation mode conforming active application.. Simple to reproduce\n\ndownload the ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/vim80-069w32.zip\nunpack it to some clean folder, so you get, for example C:\\Tools\\vim\\vim80\\vim.exe\ncreate config file near to vim.exe, for example C:\\Tools\\vim\\vim80\\vimrc.conemu with contents described in docs\n\nrun vim with created config file using -u switch, for example to open the file uninstal.txt (from vim80 folder)\nvim -u vimrc.conemu uninstal.txt\n\n\nenjoy working mouse wheel in vim started in ConEmu\n\n\nif still not working, run the following command\nConEmu -basic -dir C:\\Tools\\vim\\vim80 -nosingle -run vim -u vimrc.conemu uninstal.txt \n. > No ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT, changing to = 0x000001F7\n\nNot sure of the exact nature of this message, but it seems promising\n\n\n\nAs I said before, KeyEvents may get different input than vim due to miscellaneous reasons.. The folder vim80 does not have README.txt file.\nAlso you don't follow exact gudeline posted above.\nFor example, your conemu.vimrc is buggy:\n\n. \n. I had commented line \" echo hello, that was the reason for size difference.\nWell, try to use -log switch and post here link to zip-ed log files. E.g.\nConEmu.exe -log -basic -nosingle -run vim -u conemu.vimrc uninstal.txt\n\n. Try to move the mouse over screen while scrolling the wheel. Perhaps smth is broken in Win10 again.. Please redo logs (with mouse wheeling) on this test build:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/f6xwg9kl5kl0tvr/ConEmu.exe.170109.7z?dl=0. Someone (either conhost or vim) sets the ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE in the console input modes. That means \"application do not want mouse input\". So the wheel is not posted too.. Try this test build:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/04yo06vssx52tlx/ConEmu.exe.170109a.7z?dl=0. Since ConEmu build 170730 mouse emulation was implemented in xterm-compatible way.\nI can't remember where I took from suggestions to remap <Esc>[62~ and <Esc>[63~. So they are deprecated now.\nThe following config would be enough\n~~~\nif !has(\"gui_running\")\n    set term=xterm\n    set mouse=a\n    set nocompatible\nendif\n~~~\n. What Vim do you use now?. 1. Downloaded and installed current official vim version from here: ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/gvim80-586.exe\n2. Modified the file vimrc_example.vim as described here\nMouse wheel is working and click&drag selects text.\nI don't know what have you modified in your config, but that is not a ConEmu bug.\n. You can. \nSettings/Keys/type \"group\" in the search field. > I tried several workarounds\nWhich exactly?. So, you haven't even read ConEmu docs?\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. What exactly doesn't work? What do you press and what do you expect?. Do you use cygwin/msys connector?. http://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#wslbridge. The page https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html contains all information you interested in.. As I said above. You need connector+wslbridge to give ConEmu ability to bypass Microsoft's conhost bugs.. What is the version of the connector you are trying?. New version is bundled with ConEmu. wsl-con.cmd may download old one.. Version of the connector of course. It's the only significant thing.. As I said above:\n\nNew version is bundled with ConEmu.\n\nDid you downloaded Pack or Installer? Doesn't matter. Proper and latest connector's binaries are located in the folder with ConEmuC.exe.\nOf course, connector requires proper cygwin1.dll, msys-2.0.dll, etc.\nwslbridge.exe and wslbridge-backend are required too, and they requires proper cygwin1.dll, msys-2.0.dll, etc.\nBatch file wsl-con.cmd is obsolete, if was created earlier to demonstrate the ability.. 1. What does \"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\"  --version print?\n2. What does \"Terminal modes\" status bar column show when you run connector+wslbridge?. I see now. You need version 1.1. But it was but released as binary. Sources only yet.. In the ConEmu distribution.. Next alpha build.. Till then: https://github.com/Maximus5/cygwin-connector/releases/tag/v1.1. Conhost.exe is closed source Microsoft application. So I can't fix conhost's bugs.\n@miniksa can you take a look at this? It's rather strange that conhost tries to paint anything utilizing CPU even its window is invisible!\nPerhaps related: CPU and I/O consumption. Check the permissions? Download forbidden...\n\n. It works!. The code raises crash in the Windows kernel. @miniksa is that expected?\nDWORD dwType, dwSize;\nRegQueryValueEx(hKeyNames, L\"Counters\", 0, &dwType, NULL, &dwSize);\n\n. Try this test build\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vkp1yz14ataj4e8/ConEmu64.exe.170110.7z?dl=0. > Was this correct?\nYep.\nThings are worse that I can imagine. The crash occurs at\n~~~\n\nadvapi32.dll!PerflibciSetObjectsValidityState()\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciEnsureCounterSetList()\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciEnsurePerflibV2StringTable()\n    advapi32.dll!PerfGetNames()\n    advapi32.dll!_guard_dispatch_icall_nop()\n    KERNELBASE.dll!LocalBaseRegQueryValue()\n    KERNELBASE.dll!RegQueryValueExW()\n~~~\n\nThat means, the Insider build 15002 is broken completely. ConEmu can't do anything with that.. The bug doesn't relate to BashOnWindows. It's native Windows API bug.. Perhaps it depends on BashOnWindows, but only MSDT devs may check that.. @asser-dk I see BitDefender in the loaded modules. I'm almost sure it's not a problem, but can you run Bash/ConEmu without it to ensure?\n~~~\navcuf64.dll *C:\\Program Files\\Bitdefender\\Endpoint Security\\Signatures\\AVC\\AVC3_00565_030\\avcuf64.dll   3.12.17122.6492 25.11.2016 14:46    000000006C0B0000-000000006C15E000\n~~~\n@miniksa Can we do anything to troubleshoot or report the problem? At the moment it looks like a race in advapi32.dll (PerflibciSetObjectsValidityState). Two crash dump are available.\n~~~\nadvapi32.dll        10  10.00.15002.1001    13.09.1936 0:19 00007FF93D9D0000-00007FF93DA78000\n~~~\n~~~\n\nadvapi32.dll!PerflibciSetObjectsValidityState()   \n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciEnsureCounterSetList()  + 0xb7 bytes\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciEnsurePerflibV2StringTable()  + 0xd6 bytes  \n    advapi32.dll!PerfGetNames()  + 0x40a bytes\n    advapi32.dll!_guard_dispatch_icall_nop()  + 0x5c0f bytes  \n    KERNELBASE.dll!LocalBaseRegQueryValue()  + 0x43f bytes\n    KERNELBASE.dll!RegQueryValueExW()  + 0xf6 bytes \n~~~\n. Thanks for investigations! Unfortunately I have not yet updated any of my PC to 15002 build, so I can't say yes or no.\nI believe you are right and the function was detoured.\nConEmu doesn't detour its own executable, so the problem might be in BitDefender.. I think it's not required due to 1a1324d. No. Impossible. Search through existing issues.. ConEmu is native Windows application with absolutely no dependencies which can be used in any Windows version from 2000.\nAnd I hope it will be further.\n\nEdge is Metro application. Will not use .Net for simple application!. Why don't complain to Microsoft on their bad UI design instead?. \nWindows XP is still used by many people, and it doesn't differ a lot from 2k.\nI'm trying to convince users that without telling Microsoft of bad design, it would never been improved.. 1. I don't see any sense in that. Small and fast application would become huge (with dependencies) and voracious.\n2. Even if one use .Net (not Metro) they would face necessity to implement parts of code in either native dll or pinvoke.. There is already hotkey to show list of tabs, but this issue is not about that.. @mmoore99 Nope, it doesn't. Show the screenshot. Yep. You are using a build from year 2016. Please read what you posted.\nThird-party application problems. Please read what you posted.\nThe issue (first message) contains rubbish.\nPlease edit it.\nBad Issues. Does Ctrl+C work if you run the following?\nConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}\n\n. I didn't ask that.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1018#issuecomment-273846370. 1. Press Win+R\n2. Type ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}\n3. Than try Ctrl+C\n4. Report the result. @miniksa Can you check this? Seems like conhost window doesn't process WM_KEYDOWN message anymore? I don't know other way to emulate Ctrl+C.. @miniksa I just post C key supposing the Ctrl is pressed at the moment.\n~~~\nSendMessage(ghConWnd, WM_KEYDOWN, r.Event.KeyEvent.wVirtualKeyCode /it's 'C' or 67/, 0);\n~~~\nIt worked previously on all Windows versions. However, some users reported this method has large lags in some undefined cases.\nYep, this method looks like a dirty hack - it's asynhronous and uses assumptions.\nBut GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(0,0) just does not work as expected. It may terminates ping for example (same as Ctrl+C), but it does not break ReadConsole function which cmd.exe uses for prompt reading.\nActually, it would be much better, if GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(0,0) behave the same as real Ctrl+C keypress, than ConEmu will use official way to post break events.. Is there a way to install fresh insider build? Have tried three times to update clean installation from 14393 to 15014.\nIt just hangs after rebooting, and if I reset the PC, 14393 is back.. @miniksa Sure, backward compatibility is a hell... Perhaps new flag (e.g. 0x10000) in dwCtrlEvent to break ReadConsole would be a good solution.. Ctrl-C never asked confirmation to break the process.\nSo, ConEmu's internal kill process would not as confirmation too.\nThe idea of the kill it to do kill ASAP to minimize the harm running process may do. Moreover, if the running process voraciously uses CPU or HDD, the confirmation dialog may appear after long delay and the kill would not have any effect.. @fluffynuts \n\nAnd yet, it does\n\nYou showed screenshot of the \"Kill active process\". It shows confirmation as expected. The reason is very simple - there is no way to determine active process, ConEmu uses some AI and assumptions to detect it, therefore user have to confirm these assumptions.\nI talked about \"Terminate (kill) all but shell processes\" which proceeds immediately without confirmation.\n. That is expected behavior\nQuake style by design is expected to be single instance application.\nHotkey is registered globally by WinAPI and therefore acts for the first instance only.. Wrong questions have bad answers.\nYou should use configs to instantiate different instances. Obviously, each config may have unique set of global hotkeys.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuArgs.html. Different configs mean absolutely different configs. They are different.\nJust run ConEmu -config DB and setup it.\nAs I said, global hotkeys were developed for certain instance. And you can't get exact window (DB/GIT/...) by one hotkey.. Why do you spawn cmd.exe outside of ConEmu? It would be much better to get it in new tab inside ConEmu window.. Why do you use ConEmu? Is suppose to get proper terminal, don't you?\nThan, why do you run new cmd.exe in legacy console window instead of ConEmu?. Did you disable \"Multiple consoles in one ConEmu window\"?\nIf so, Win+X shall open new window, if it opens new tab - it's a bug.. What for?\nConEmu creates tasks for all found (installed) Visual Studio prompts. With few clicks user may change (or create a copy) them.\nMoreover, for example I have following toolsets installed:\n\namd64\namd64_arm\namd64_x86\narm\nx86_amd64\nx86_arm\n\nWhich do you suppose ConEmu have to suggest by default? All six or even more? That would be crazyness.. Perhaps you need to search in settings first?. And what? Do you know what \"required files\" mean? They are required.. Why do you report ssh bugs here?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. What have you checked to be sure in that?. Simple googling by \"cmalloc would have returned NULL\" make me sure it's not a ConEmu's problem. For example: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-07/msg00185.html\nYou may try to use connector or decrease the size of the window.. Closed as not related to ConEmu.\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. I'm tired to explaining why cygwin and msys bugs should NOT be addressed to ConEmu.\nSeems like downvoters are not able to understand that.\n\n@diegocr gpg problem is off-topic here. Have you tried it in bash started from mintty? If it works in mintty (I doubt) you should report that to gpg devs. Otherwise don't hesitate to create new issue here.. * https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n* https://conemu.github.io/blog/2017/01/18/Build-170118.html. Only one question. Why do you try to use debug build of ConEmu, if you aren't its developer?. I have no idea where did you get this icon.\n\n. I can't understand why do you use Far without ConEmu.\nAnyway, in your case you may set up console alias like that run=conemu -run $* -new_console:c.. You shall create and use alias in the Far.. It's a duplicate of the existing issue. AFAIR there is existing feature request. http://conemu.github.io/en/RoadMap.html#horizontal-scrolling. 2399ae7, 04cddcd. It's either unbelievable or cmd's bug.\nShow screenshots.. Are you using clink? So why do you report its problem here?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/FaqPlainShell.html. You do minimize ConEmu, don't you?\nThan if you restore it the [*] mark is created from the active tab, so you can't \"check\" if it was modified.\nIf inactive tab was modified, than it is not shown on taskbar (by default).\nWhat do you propose [*] mark on taskbar means?. I may implement flashing on changes.\nIt would look like\nConEmuC -GuiMacro Flash 1 3 3\n\n. \nScreenshot \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 Main. It's not a question for ConEmu actually.\nRTFM: http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html#bash-history. Sorry, thought it was already implemented. It would look like SetOption(\"Check\", 1574, \"Toggle\").. Sure, there are no code yet.. ConEmu is not a game...\nAnd you have bit suggested anther one. http://conemu.github.io/en/#Disclaimer. \n. Toolbar? It's located on the top of the window by default.\nWhere have you seen \"normal\" dropdowns? Creating tabs from tasks or any arbitrary shell is a feature unique to ConEmu. I don't think current behavior must be changed.. Tasks are uncommon to any application except ConEmu.\nSo you are expected to get used to tasks representations.\nAlso, \"new tab\" creator in almost any tabbed applications (mainly browsers) is a small usually rectangle button. Making it wider has no sense. Are you scare from pixel-hunting? Use keyboard instead.\n. If you use full-size keyboard than maximized windows resize automatically\nIf you don't, user able to scroll the contents easily with fingers.\nI don't think that implementing some automatic scrolling is good idea. In fact, the scrolling can't be done if output reaches the bottom of the buffer or even the console application outputs directly at the bottom of the buffer.. Show example screenshots. Screenshots. http://conemu.github.io/en/FaqPlainShell.html#PowerShell. There is also -reuse switch.\n. Perhaps there were different AppID in started ConEmu windows.. \n1. There is no status bar on screenshots.\n2. True color support in ConEmu is limited to the bottom of the buffer.\n3. RoadMap and existing issues.. It doesn't mean any good thing. There is no API to get 24bit colors from conhost.. Any console ssh client capable to write raw ANSI to terminal instead of trying to process them internally may show 24bit colors in ConEmu.\ncygwin/msys connector. Merged: gh-227. Please learn hew to use PowerShell properly. Obviously your error doesn't cone from ConEmu.\nYou shall escape \"bars\" in the PS prompt.. Wrong place to asks questions about cmder.\nTwo hints. Directory have to be double-quoted. Cmder forces working directory to use profile.. Please show text data from About/SysInfo.\nAnd output from \"ConEmuC -checkunicode\".. 1. Do you see the problem in the latest 170227 build?\n2. Try to run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}. Any changes?. @miniksa Seems like it's a compatibility issue. Haven't checked it thoroughly yet on 15031, but on stable Win10 build 14393 cursor coordinates are reported from the console properly.. Just checked on Win10 build 15031 (GetSystemMetrics(SM_DBCSENABLED) == 0). The problem exists. The ReadConsoleOutputW does not return COMMON_LVB_***_BYTE flags, but GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo reports wrong X position in dwCursorPosition as if cells are doubled with COMMON_LVB_***_BYTE.\nConEmu can't do anything with that. @terrywh you shall wait for next insider build with a fix.\n\nlsbi    {dwSize={X=0x006e Y=0x03e8 } dwCursorPosition={X=0x0004 Y=0x0007 } wAttributes=0x0007 ...}  _CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO\npLine,10    0x0000023622d30cc0 {{Char={UnicodeChar=0x003e '>' AsciiChar=0x3e '>' } Attributes=0x0008 }, {Char={UnicodeChar=...} ...}, ...}  _CHAR_INFO[0x0000000a]\n    [0x00000000]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x003e '>' AsciiChar=0x3e '>' } Attributes=0x0008 }  _CHAR_INFO\n    [0x00000001]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x0020 ' ' AsciiChar=0x20 ' ' } Attributes=0x0008 }  _CHAR_INFO\n    [0x00000002]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x63a5 '\u63a5' AsciiChar=0xa5 '\u0490' } Attributes=0x0007 }  _CHAR_INFO\n    [0x00000003]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x53e3 '\u53e3' AsciiChar=0xe3 '\u0433' } Attributes=0x0007 }  _CHAR_INFO\n    [0x00000004]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x8fde '\u8fde' AsciiChar=0xde '\u042e' } Attributes=0x0007 }  _CHAR_INFO\n    [0x00000005]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x63a5 '\u63a5' AsciiChar=0xa5 '\u0490' } Attributes=0x0007 }  _CHAR_INFO\n    [0x00000006]    {Char={UnicodeChar=0x0020 ' ' AsciiChar=0x20 ' ' } Attributes=0x0007 }  _CHAR_INFO. e0dc924. So, you press LBtn, drag mouse to select text, release LBtn, and at that moment observe delay before copying to clipboard? Perhaps the delay has effect on the screen repaint only?. Show your settings.\nI think it's due to your configuration... Paste does not imply preceding Copy.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsMarkCopy.html#id2340. It is expected behavior.\nAs I understand you have chosen Paste action for Middle mouse button (IMHO Right button is more handy).\nSo, Middle button does not do copying and pastes current contents of the clipboard.\nThe copying is done by timer because of click/double-click/triple-click. And Copying is not implied by Paste action.\nIf you want proper paste of selected text or clipboard contents you have to use Auto actio for your middle mouse button.. Copying takes time. Copying puts to clipboard unwanted data, some applications monitor the clipboard and ConEmu may just fail to copy text twice. Moreover, copying is not required if you want just to paste the selected text immediately.. Also, implementation of \"reset on copy\" conflicts with double and triple-clicks.. auto works on strict rules:\n if you click inside selection, the selection is pasted internally, without modifying Windows clipboard. That's very useful, because you have your clipboard intact (c++ code snippets or so) and the paste was done.\n if you click outside of selection, the copy operation is done.\n.

Please report issues properly. Read this: Bad Issues\nAt least:\n1. No version info\n2. No exact information how do you run ConEmu\n3. No LogFiles. Your issue was bad because I couldn't understand your problem.\nInstead four long posts you may write jyst \"Apply button is not enabled for negative numbers of X coord\".\nScreenshots makes it clearer.. Don't be rude!!!. > i think you have an attitude problem\n\nif you are clever?\n\nI've politely asked for information but you rudely and aggressively argue. It's a bad attitude in either conversation, moreover I the open-source project issues . \nWhat do you mean?. http://conemu.github.io/en/CpuIoConsumption.html. I believe it depends on your Far settings and panels contents.\nCrash dump is appreciated.. No, your problem has different source.. I'm not sure if it should be set.\nEnvironment variables are inherited automatically (processed by CreateProcess internally by Windows), but aliases are set in per-console basis and new console does not inherit them indeed.\nMoreover, if you run Bash (cygwin, msys or even more WSL), neither variables nor aliases could be inherited. It's physically impossible.. Why don't to set aliases in the Environment settings page?. I see. Hm, what conditions are when output is empty in the editor? What is purpose of the patch? Issue?. I mean, macro Ctrl+O works for me perfectly.. I don't see the problem: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/688#issuecomment-285908855. > A semicolon after a member function definition is optional.\nIt's not an error, so because I like them, it's my code style.. Don't you ask ConEmu to open ConEmu64.exe in the new tab of existing ConEmu window? Do you know what happens if you put two mirrors face to face?\nPress button \"Add default tasks\" and let ConEmu create proper task instead of bad one!. f6e2a6afa1fe786d7eb8a938263b7f3acadbaca3. @miniksa Seems like GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo returns negative value -32764 in the CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO::srWindow.Bottom. This happens after RDP seance.\nI can't reproduce this on my PC.\n@igor-brylin This is an assertion, but not a crash. ConEmu can't work with broken RealConsole information and notifies you.. @igor-brylin I need LogFiles to be sure.\nPlease run ConEmu64.exe -log, reproduce the assertion, and put here link to log files.. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. ConEmu would never customize any ChildGui application.\nUsers should use real console applications instead of their graphical analogs.\nDon't you expect ConEmu changes, for example, sprites/graphics/background of computer games if they are running in window mode inside ConEmu? Quake for example? ;-)\n. @jrcharney Well, proper location of this article would be in the ChildGui page. However personally I don't like ChildGui inside ConEmu because they are not console applications and ConEmu has no control over them.\nI run WSL, cygwin bash, git for windows directly in ConEmu tabs without third-party wrappers like PuTTY or mintty.. > Why not call it native terminal emulator , or something like that.\nI named \"real console\" so long ago to distinguish it from \"virtual console\" where ConEmu draws the text. I dislike the \"native terminal emulator\" term, because it's not clear is it ConEmu or \"conhost\".\n https://conemu.github.io/en/RealConsole.html\n https://conemu.github.io/en/VirtualConsole.html\n\nI hadn't intended on using anything that had graphics in it.\n\nBut you do. PuTTY, mintty and others \"had graphics in it\". They paints graphics instead of \"writing\" text data (ASCII or Unicode) to \"standard output\".\n\nIf the boss likes PuTTY, I'll use PuTTY.\n\nThat's pity but understandable.\n\nI had almost forgot how different WSL and BUW were\n\nHm? WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) and BUW (Bash on Ubuntu on Windows) are two sides of the same coin.\nAlso, WSLbridge is not a ChildGui or mintty, it's a real console application.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. 1. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 Environment64 \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443.\n2. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u044e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c 32 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0437 64 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0448\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442.\n3. \u0418 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e.\n\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0421\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435, \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0442\u044b \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e.\n\u041d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c PATH \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 CmdInit.\n. Admin shield is displayed as expected. By design.. At the moment standard Windows' TabBar control is used and ConEmu does not draw icons itself.\nI  future improvements would be possible.. I'll take a look. There is an option in ConEmu.xml\n. And would never work! RTFM: https://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html. I don't know what have you entered in the startup field or task. Something wrong.\nJust run ConEmu64.exe -detached and correct your settings.\nAnyway, it's interesting what is wrong with your settings.. Press \"Add default tasks\" and see the {bash} created for you.\n. Do you prefer to forget about the ilness instead of taking medicine?. The statement if (!rcCon.right || !rcCon.bottom) means the space assigned for ConEmu console width or height is zero. This is invalid situation of course. Shrinking real console to zero-size is even impossible, but setting it to such small values causes erasing of almost all collected previously output (backscroll buffer too).\nAre you trying to create zero-size ConEmu window? I doubt, but.... Can you share sample project demonstrating the assertion?. Haven't checked it yet, pending.... At last...\nYou are creating ConEmu with zero-width. This means you create zero-width RealConsole.\nEven if ConEmu creates RealConsole ignoring requested width, when you try to resize ConEmu control, console will either reflow its contents or even crop long lines from existing output.. Well, let me google for you\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/2d506b96-e856-4752-90af-4f8194bb0040/windows-7-command-prompt-message-errors-cmdexe?forum=w7itprogeneral. The mentioned page tells about the problem in cmd.exe and the page doesn't mention ConEmu, right?\nThat means the problem is in cmd, but not ConEmu.\n. But you may try to run dir from ConEmu started as following\n\nConEmu -basic -run {cmd}\nConEmu -basic -run cmd.exe\nConEmu -basic -run cmd.exe /D\n. Old Builds. 180416?. BashOnWindows in ConEmu. Did you read the link I posted? It describes in details your problem.. It's a duplicate. Posted several time already. Use search.. Path (with xml file name) or the directory where xml is located?\nProposed environment variable name?. Duplicate: gh-1051. RTFM: Shell working directory. > it's worth mentioning somewhere in the UI around the appropriate settings that it won't work w/o manual adjustment\n\nWhere do you suggest to place a note and how to weird it?\nYour snippet is useful, will place it in docs.. 1. Your snippet is not complete. I have naked PS> prompt when use it.\n2. The page PowershellPrompt.html has more complicated example with prompt selection support.. I do not believe the same command with exactly the same conditions does not fail without ConEmu.\nThird-party application problems. ConEmu can't physically do anything to \"change\" git upstream.. She git status and git --version in both environments.. It would be helpful to know what version is working and where the problem appears.. That is not useful. Two years passed since 150813g.. Git 2.11 is absolutely different bundle and its not related to the issue.\nAre you sure there is no problem with 170316/1.9.5?. ConEmu doesn't \"draw\" standard WinApi controls for obvious reason: they are standard, and are painted by WinApi internally.\nAnd I don't consider to draw them internally by ConEmu... Implement the bicycle?. However, @miniksa is it possible to fill that as a bug in Windows GUI, which fails to paint controls in standard dialog properly?. I use CreateDialogIndirectParam to create settings pages. Native WinApi.. Have you tried to find?\n\n. If you don't use connector, all output errors should be reported to cygwin!. What do you mean by \"command history\"? The contents of the backscroll buffer (std output)?\nIf so, I have no plans to restore it. It's rather complicated task and it may not be even possible with some shells or applications. ConEmu tries to restarts tabs in most similar environment as possible, nothing more.\nFrom your words about lost working directory I can make the conclusion that you don't use cmd.exe as shell and you have not read manual: Shell working directory\n. It has no sense unfortunately.\nThe bottle neck is actually not a ConEmu \"scrolling\", but conhost throughput speed.\nBecause ConEmu provides full RealConsole functions support, we can't do things \"faster\" than they are done by conhost.\nPerhaps, in future, I would implement RealConsole server internally, without need of conhost, but I can't predict any time frame.\nBut, I'm almost sure ConEmu may be faster than native console window, because conhost may do some optimization when its window is invisible.. Shell I guess your Windows build?\nOr how do you run bash?\nReading: BashOnWindows in ConEmu. http://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#arrows-sol-2. RTFM: Shell working directory. Yes, and what task have you specified as \"default\"?. \n. Unless user tells ConEmu which task it shall use for Win+W, the startup task is used.\nIt's logical and by design.. Remove what item?. \nThis item is your current command executed in the active console.. Why did you crop the screenshot? Where is the StatusBar?. Almost. What is shown by \"Terminal modes\" status bar column?. Two notes.\n\nSeems like you are not using connector: http://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html\nActual build at the moment is 170402.\n\nAnyway, I think that it's not a ConEmu bug. . Generally you need connector for cygwin/msys when you face cygwin/msys bug. The WSL is expected to be working properly without it. If not, you shall report the problem on the WSL issue tracker.\nI believe if you would use predefined {bash} Task you will not see keyboard problem.. Sure it is not. Actually, it never was.\nBashOnWindows\nWinApi doesn't expose list of processes running in Linux subsystem.. I see now. @christoferd This issue was fixed and closed.\nFrom your description is absolutely not clear what versions did you use. Anyway, if you are talking about WSL, incomplete operations are not and will not be detected there. . The echo is processed by ConEmu itself and you may just write echo \"^[[9999H\". Actually, 9999 may be not enough if you have specified greater number in the console buffer height.. It's all in docs.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/VersionComparison.html. Read this please: Bad Issues. Hm... The reason?. 8bce6e8. Do you autorun the ConEmu on Windows startup?. Sure, it's wrong syntax. Correct syntax is.\n~~~\n\nset ConEmuPalette=\"\"\n~~~\n\nor \n~~~\n\nset \"ConEmuPalette=\"\n~~~\n\nSo I do not understand your problem.. You have not checked your issue before posting. Seems like github eats some text due to markdown formatting. Anyway, from you description, I can make a conclusion that the bug in inside your plugin, so you shall report the problems to plugin's author.. I have absolutely no idea what you are doing... No problems here\n\n. 1. Show your ConEmu/About text\n2. I noted that your first command line has no space identation ~faasd asd. And zsh prints ... not found: fasd. No double aa.. Mintty is not a Windows full featured terminal. It's just a pty emulator not related to conhost.\nWithout repro steps this will be closed.. @kvnxiao not enough information.. @kvnxiao I can't check this on Japanese Win10 now. Can you paste several \u2192 in bash (where cursor is bad positioned) and make \"Dump screen\" (ConEmu system menu / Debug).\nPlease attach created file and show text from ConEmu/About/SysInfo.. This looks like a bug in conhost.\n@miniksa Can you check this, please?. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2017/12/03/Build-171203.html\nGlyphs widths is a mess.\nConEmu tries to draw glyph widths properly, but what about columns?\nMy point is that StatusBar must show characters count instead of some abstract column indexes taking into account one, two or more cells they use.\nHow many times user have to press BS key or Left/Right key to move by one character? One time per character.\nHow many symbols would be placed in the clipboard when user selects the \"\u304b\"? One character.\nSo ConEmu shows cursor position in characters as normal text editors do.\nBut conhost API return \"columns\" and it's rather tricky to obtain proper cursor position.. @Engine-Treasure You didn't tell us ConEmu version. > when executing zsh with oh-my-zsh\nzsh from which package: msys2/cygwin/wsl/else?\n\nin both CMD and Powershell.\n\nDo you run cmd.exe / powershell.exe in ConEmu and from their prompt run zsh.exe?\n. I said many times, that due to bugs in bash (WSL) the only correct way to run WSL in ConEmu is wslbridge.. However, I don't observe wrong cursor position after ConEmu64.exe -basic -run powershell.exe. Even if I don't run WSL via wslbridge (directly bash.exe from powershell prompt).\n\n. Yes. Win 10 1709.\nI need the following\n\nAbout/SysInfo\nLogFiles and Screenshot of Info settings page when you observe cursor glitch. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1106#issuecomment-361411132. > still have this issue on windows 10 1709.\n\nNo ConEmu version.\n\nthis happens when I set the \"Language for non-unicode program\" = zh_cn\n\nIt does not matter. Terminal should work properly in any OS settings.\n\nif I change this value to en_us, it works perfectly, but then the native powershell won't show chinese charactors any more, regardless any codepage, encoding settings >_<\n\nThat's interesting, but I don't think it's related.\n\n. Only one question: why do you use old ConEmu build?. @jakara Don't you speak about native console window? But it does not relate to ConEmu and this issue, isn't it?\nThis issue is opened too long, too many versions of Windows 10 and ConEmu were released and I still have not received information about actual state.\nIf one observe cursor problem with current version of ConEmu, don't hesitate to create new issue (you may post link to this one) with information: versions, screenshots, output of ConEmuC -checkunicode and Abous/SysInfo.. API does not exists.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html. It's good for bash.\nAgain. There is no API to retrieve color information.\nRTFM.. Don't do that or don't use mintty.\nChildGui has strong limitations.. What I'm doing wrong?\n\n. I didn't make a decision yet. This issue needs more investigations, perhaps I can implement some workarounds, if it really depends on ConEmu.. 1. node --version? yarn --version?\n2. Update ConEmu to latest preview\n3. During broken progress lines show screenshot with ConEmu and Settings/Info page visible.\n. 4. Text from ConEmu/About/SysInfo. 2all: are you using clink? Try to disable it.. Is the problem reproduced if you run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd?. RTFM: ChildGui has strong limitations. Don't use mintty.\nI will not spawn more global hotkeys, that would be bad UX.. And RTFM again: cygwin/msys connector. If you are able to suggest improvements in docs - pull request are appreciated!\nGlobal hotkeys are not so flexible as \"native\" ones. I strongly dislike to seize combinations from running applications... And what's worse, GUI applications are used to much more broader hotkey system than console ones. So it would be bad to intercept them.\nAnyway, there is a workaround to process any \"native\" hotkey in ConEmu. Described in docs.. 1. I have not seen that ever\n2. The problem may be in other cmder parts\n3. If you may build ConEmu, than you may run debugger and check the place where the waiting occurs. I suppose, some deadlock may take place. Also, LogFiles may contain useful information.. How do you run WSL?. How many times I shall explain that using of connector is essential?\n\nRead BashOnWindows in ConEmu\nDownload and install latest ConEmu build (180628 at the moment)\nRun ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}\n. I'm working on improving pty interface. Until then ConEmu does what it can at most. Still can't reproduce the issue.\nIt may be some extra configuration of tmux on your side.\nSo the questions:\nUbuntu release?\nDo you start WSL with default {bash} task? E.g. ConEmu64.exe -run {bash}.\ncat ~/.tmux.conf?\ntmux -V? How have you installed it?\nset | grep TERM?\nDo you work with local host or ssh somewhere?\nWhat keys (exactly) do you press to get the issue?\nAnything else? May be you have modified other dot-files what have some effect.... ConEmu+connector do their best to push escape sequences in the input queue atomicly. But it's a byte stream, delays may come somehow. > Is the mouse=x54 normal?\n\nJFI, it's a mouse mode requested by console. Expected if requested ;). Changing the layout after pane creation is not allowed at the moment.\nYou may create a pane in a split and maximize/restore it.. 1. Shall I guess what shell do you use?\n2. Settings page shows you an example: http://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsEnvironment.html. Use existing issues instead of creating duplicates. They are not so far\ngh-1114\n. Report your problem on the correct site. Cmder or clink.\nThird-party application problems. Really? Why do you think it's not an external issue? This is not a bugtracker of the clink.. The clink \"executes\" prompts. That's all. Unless you disable clink, this is Third-party application problems.. \"Suppress bells\" does not actually suppress any sound console application may produce. It suppress only \\x07 output. So, properly realized beep shall work.. What do you see there? \"Clink\"! Disable clink to \"hide\" it or ask the question to clink's author.\nFrom your screenshot I can make conclusion that you are using cmder. So you questions shall be addressed to the cmder bundle.\nIf not - you may edit the task {cmd} and strip the CmdInit.cmd call from there.. Never seen that. I need more info\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html#Crash_dumps. Same as gh-1012. I see third-pary module injected in ConEmu64.exe.\nC:\\Program Files\\N-able Technologies\\AVDefender\\Signatures\\AVC\\AVC3_00551_008\\avcuf64.dll\nAnd crazy stack rising the crash (simple RegQueryValueEx call)\n000001a5d8c1f690()  Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciInsertRedBlackNode()  Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!SaferpLogResultsToFile()   Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciBuildCounterSet() Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciBuildProvider()   Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciEnsureCounterSetList()    Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!PerflibciEnsurePerflibV2StringTable()  Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!PerfGetNames() Unknown\n    advapi32.dll!__guard_ss_verify_sp_default() Unknown\n    KERNELBASE.dll!LocalBaseRegQueryValue() Unknown\n    KERNELBASE.dll!RegQueryValueExW()   Unknown\n    ConEmu64.exe!CProcessData::LoadPerfData() Line 326  C++\nI think you should test the problem without AVDefender and complain to \"N-able Technologies\" (I believe the problem will go away).\n. Do you use connector? If you don't, you shall report the problem to Microsoft.. Reveal the RealConsole, set focus into it and try to paste there.. You must be sure ALL real console properties are THE SAME in both windows.. Happens? Do you mean the pasting problem appears after you drag the ConEmu between monitors?\nTo summarize:\n\nWhen you run bash.exe (WSL) in ConEmu without connector\nand run ssh there to some third machine\nsometimes the pasting long lines into the bash/ssh prompt do not do CR, right?\n\nFew more questions. If the problem occurs:\n\nIn \"Terminal modes\" status bar column there is \"BrPaste\" option. Try to change it. Any changes?\nIn ConEmu the Paste is working like simply \"typing\". So, the problem have to be occurred when you just hold a key to type long sequence. Isn't it?\nIf you show in the time RealConsole, put focus in it and host a key, does the problem reproduces?\nIn RealConsole properties there is an option \"Use legacy console\" (https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1111#issuecomment-294752049). You shall restart console to apply it. Any changes?\n\n@miniksa I think the problem is inside conhost. Can you check that?. The difference may be in the API which the shell is using.\nBash (doesn't matter WSL or msys/cygwin) reads keypresses one-by-one. But cmd uses ReadConsole which does not return to user mode until Enter.. Thanks, Michael!\nIs there a way to disable reflowing from ConEmu? It's nice to retail upper buffer contents, which is irreversible cropped otherwise, but it cause problems.\nAs an alternative, I think about software reflowing implemented by ConEmu or reflowing only invisible part of the buffer.. I close this as external issue.\nAlso, I think if you use wslbridge+connector you'd not see the issue.. @nick4fake Yes. It's conhost problem.. What? Didn't understand you.... I think, if you run from Win+R the command\n\\Cygwin64\\bin\\bash.exe /bin/xhere /bin/zsh\nYou would get \"starting\" message in Win7 without ConEmu too.. RTFM. TSA.. If you use WSL, ConEmu has absolutely no control over git, bash or anything else. Report to Microsoft.\n\nThird-party application problems\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. Nothing to do with ConEmu. Just run it via batch\n\nRun-node.cmd\n:do_run\nNode .....args....\ngoto do_run. I have no plans to implement such feature in near future. For now, one window = one instance.\nEven Chrome do not switch between windows on Alt+Tab.\nThe logic of switching would be rather complicated, I'm not sure if it is worse expected time.. So, why do you think it's not a Third-party problem?. Tasks. Why do you think it's not a third-party problem?. You didn't understand.\nWhere did you \"test\" it? In ConEmu? Why?\nTest it without ConEmu!. Ctrl+/ never worked for me. Even from RealConsole. If don't know why but this is a question for another place.\nBut the Ctrl+_ (which is actually Ctrl+Shift+- on my keyboard layout) is working properly.. Just start text section with shift+left/right.. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1137#issuecomment-300441912. Not an issue, but the comment\n\nJust start text section with shift+left/right.\n\nWhy did you ignore it?\n. I still do not understand your purpose. Shift+Left/Right solves your issue.. Why not? Press Shift+PgUp after then.. 1. No Windows version\n2. If it's a Win10 than you didn't search for duplicates. It's actually a bug in Windows.\nAnyway, I'm interested in text from ConEmu/About/SysInfo.. @MewX, if you check the whats_new, you can see when it was fixed.. And what do you expect?. * What shell do you use?\n* What neovim/bundle version do you use?\n. I do not see \"terminal modes\" status bar column. It looks like you are not using connector (non msys/cygwin vim).\nAlso, it's but clear if you are using xterm emulation.\nAt the moment I do not believe the same problem can't be reproduced without ConEmu.\nThird-party application problems\nNo sense to compare with WSL version or GVim. Both are too different from standard Windows console application.. Again. I don't believe you can't reproduce that without ConEmu.\nSame conditions, sizes, RealConsole properties, and after reproduction - just report the bug to Vim authors.. Which Vim version do you use? Official/cygwin/msys/wsl?\nDo you use xterm emulation?. If you do not use connector and do not use term=xterm, than all bugs should be reported to Vim authors. ConEmu has absolutely no control over its output!. @raffylopez If you don't use xterm emulation, than you should be able to reproduce the bug without ConEmu. Open RealConsole properties and compare it with vanilla conhost, set the same options.... Duplicate. Microsoft Bug.\n. Just wondering. Any changes if you turn on \"Legacy mode\" in console window properties?\nIf you have not updated Git-for-Windows, it's probably a bug in conhost.exe.\nDoes cmd.exe suffer from type issue? If it's OK, does not matter, because cmd.exe uses different API to read keyboard, but if cmd.exe is the same.... @miniksa this looks like another bug in V2 realization. Can you check it please?. BashOnWindows in ConEmu. Did you try to change keyboard mode?\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#arrows-sol-2. Just new you may set up a hotkey for each task. This is faster than pixel hunting.\nThat doesn't mean I reject the toolbar customization.. There is a hotkey to open the pop-up Tasks menu. Up to ten tasks in two clicks.. @wolfen351 Just look at the page top - the issue is open.. It looks like a Far crash! ConEmu never closes consoles without any reason.. Third-party application problems. Appreciated. Sort of\n... = (cchMax <= countof(CharsEx)) ? .... Duplicate. Use issues search please!\n. I think you can do that already. I suppose this is a duplicate of gh-1149. And how ConEmu would guess what do you want to run? Even I do not understand that from your description.. Sure. What do you think, ConEmu should do when you press \"+\" button or the \"new console\"?. What console? How ConEmu may decide this?\nOpen tasks and check your options. Have you set one task as new console?. You confuse terms. There is startup sequence and the task which used to create new console upon user request.\nObviously, if user have not specified this task, startup sequence is used instead.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTasks.html. You missed this: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTasks.html#id2750\nDid you marked the task which you want to run?. Simple question: what task is marked as \"Default task for new console\" in your settings?. Read about -new_console:c and companions\n-new_console\n. I don't know what do you pass to -run switch. But you shall pass -new_console:c there.. @Ryonez You are using VERY OldBuild. If one observe problems with fresh ConEmu build, don't hesitate to create new issue.. Third-party application problems\nPlease report clink problems to the author. I believe it works fine without clink.. There is already \"Restart current console\" hotkey\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/KeyboardShortcuts.html#Full_list. \n. Ping. Issue is closed?. I believe third-party software raises the crash. ConEmu is working fine with ssh on Windows without Comodo. And personally I use third-party antivirus software without any problems (AVP). Report to Comodo.. I said nothing about cmder.\nJust looked above to\n\ngithub-cygwin referenced this issue from commit \n\nWell, open ConEmu/About and paste here the text from SysInfo tab.. JFI, I use git in ConEmu on daily basis and haven't seen problems with rebase.. That's really strange.\nPlease try to update to latest alpha build.. Any updates on this? No messages for a long time. Did you give up?. Nowadays correct way to run msys/cygwin is the connector. That you have both ANSI and no affection of heavy msys/cygwin forking.. @unpairedbracket Is there any sense to complain on build released almost four months ago?. @raghur If you still experience the problem let us know. Please make console log file with screenshot demonstrating the problem\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiLogFiles.html#connector. 190217?. ConEmu do nothing to interfere with tailing.\nFar's viewer has awful amount of patches tailing-relative. It's quite fare to consider Far still has bugs.\nWhen user press smth in ConEmu, it just \"repost\" the key into conhost buffer.. It's very interesting, where and why do you take such Old Builds?\nNo sense to report their bugs.. I see. Unfortunately I do not maintain msys2 package. Please update ConEmu \nmanually.\n. What does that mean \"Sublime focused\"?\nChildGui or Sublime is started standalone, outside from ConEmu?\nGlobal hotkeys are processed by Windows API and ConEmu has absolutely no control when ConEmu has no focus.\nAsk Sublime authors to stop seizing keypresses or just choose another one.. As I said before, hotkeys are processed by Windows, ConEmu has no control.\nBut! The \"\u00a7\" key is not common, you can't \"enter\" it directly in standard US QWERTY layout.\nWhat languages/layouts are you using?. Just use full path. Example:\n\n. @zommuter Of course it couldn't! Learn about cmd /? especially about double quotes.\nAnyway,  you DON'T need cmd.exe at all to run wslbridge.\nMoreover, wslbridge task is precreated four you in latest ConEmu builds.. This looks like a conhost bug. I've seen that several times, but without 100% repro.\nYou may try to turn \"legacy console mode\" on.\n/cc @miniksa. Yep, that's expected...\nI consider this as external issue. Regardless the fact you can't reproduce it in bare conhost, because different API are used. ConEmu is allowed to change console buffer size programmatically only.. @miniksa Just reproduced. And I realized that contents did not disappear. In fact, text foreground color was set to the same value as background.\nSo, if you try to select text in ConEmu you'll see hidden contents. RealConsole looks like empty one, even after text selection, but Ctrl+C do copy hidden text too.. @asolopovas Have you checked WhatsNew??\nhttps://conemu.github.io/blog/2017/08/19/Build-170819.html. Duplicate. RTFM.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/Xterm256Colors.html. And what did you try? I already wrote all steps in docs.. You have ignored issue template. How could I guess what OS do you use? Moreover, you mention WSL in the last comment only!\nBashOnWindows. Shall I name all possible benefits from using connector?\nThe world is simple: no connector == no escape sequences to ConEmu, no escape sequences == no italic.. It is not possible to get ANSI from WSL without wsl-bridge. In turn, wsl-bridge doesn't work without cygwin or msys2.. https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html. I don't understand your suggestion.\nFrom where do you want to run commands?\nWhat paths do you mean?. \nLDblClk+RClk. I use it constantly.. what?. http://conemu.github.io/en/Xterm256Colors.html. Can't reproduce. Please share your conemu.xml and logfiles (run ConEmu64 -log, and reproduce the gap problem).. It's a question for ant, why it exists without any info, isn't it?\nI can't fix problems in third-party software. Few hints for you:\n\nWhat did you change these days? Not a ConEmu, because you are using stable. So, if it worked before, ConEmu can't be responsible for changes.\nTry latest ConEmu alpha build.\nTry to disable hooks.\nTry to disable antivirus software.\nContact ant authors for support.. User can configure this. Already and ever.\n\nAs for Far modes, I switch them by Ctrl+Shift+Number. Obvious place:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Q9sDK42.png\n. Well, notes about docs are fair. For me as author it's rather hard to do \nbeta-reading of many pages. PR are appreciated.\nHowever, first place to change hotkeys is page with hotkeys, isn't it?\n. \n. Whaat was the reason for letter M in -new_console?. Neither O nor N are used. Switches are case-sensitive.\nI will change it to N.. > When conemu is minimized to the system tray, clicking on a conemu icon in the taskbar creates a new tab.\nAnd this is absolutely correct.\n\nThis happens even though Single instance mode is enabled.\n\nIt says \"use existing window\". So you see the difference between window and tab? You all ConEmu to run new console, and it just does that.\n. It depends on settings.. Didn't understand you. What's the problem?. 1. ConEmu version\n2. Your task settings\n3. Presence of all executables mentioned in the error mesh. 4. Git version. RTFM: -new_console\n. Only for those tasks, where you need it.. So, what's the problem? Just use them. Who? Working directories?\nSure, because you use wrong syntax missing :d: switch. But ConEmu does not recreate task already configured by users. So I wonder, how connector appeared there?. I see. Have not checked yet. Connector was working on my PC with git-cmd. But: git version may be different and path didn't have spaces.. Duplicate: gh-1178. ChildGui. Well... The link contains thorough explanations why ChildGui behaves differently than native console applications.\nDo you suggest to paste it in the issue? Or post only the link? Or smth else?. There is http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFAQ.html\nEveryone may contribute!. It has nothing to fix with ConEmu. You may easily check that using ProcessExplorer to examine PATH in launched process tree.\nReport to MSYS. Try to use sh.exe instead of bash.exe and vice versa.. ConEmu inherits environment from parent process. To obtain new environment from parent, just restart ConEmu.\nUse search before posting.\nDuplicate: gh-468. 1. If you don't use cygwin/msys connector all issues must be addressed to Microsoft. You are using WSL, aren't you? BashOnWindows in ConEmu\n2. Before posting issues on stable version you should check if bugs are already fixed in latest alpha.. > but byobu is working fine with the pre-installed WSL window\nThat can't be. If you don't use wslbridge+connector, ConEmu just reads what WSL print to conhost.\nSo, if you have the same properties of real console (e.g. height/width, legacy mode, codepage), you have absolutely the same view in ConEmu.. If the problem persists, you may try wslconnector.\nBut it would be better to report it to Microsoft.. How exactly do you run wsl?. Don't run it that way.\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. I don't know how Mosh behaves. But from your description it seems like Mosh is a ChildGui. It creates window from window. ConEmu was not intended for such applications.\nContact Mosh authors to know how to run Mosh console.. Due to WinAPI limitation it's not possible to monitor keyboard layout in Win10.. It works if you disable per-application layouts.. Are you on insider build?\nI suppose it may be a bug in latest Windows version.\nTry to compare with previous ConEmu builds.\nTry to turn on \"Legacy mode\" in RealConsole properties (console restart is required).. Shortcuts? Where?. User must specify the command after -run switch or do not specify it at all.. https://conemu.github.io/en/CmdPrompt.html#how-to-set-up-your-prompt-automatically. There are examples in [Tasks](https://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html), even the defaultShells::cmd`.\nAlso where is an answer in a FAQ: https://conemu.github.io/en/FAQ-6.html#q-6-12. Do you really need to create splits from command line instead of running the task?. User shall mark the task which they want to use as default.\n. Just use ANSI in PS1.\n\nANSI sequences\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. It's ChildGui and ConEmu can't be responsible for third-party bugs.\nCan you reproduce the problem with notepad or mintty?\nAnyway, ChildGui is sort of side feature, using console shells is always preferred.. > it worked perfectly in the previous build(s), and has for months.\n\nAlmost unbelievable. You may easily download previous ConEmu version and check the behavior. I'm almost sure it will be the same.\nIf so, you shall report the problem to Fatty authors.. Seems like you have not try to search in the issues.\nAnyway, Ctrl+/ never worked for me. Even from RealConsole. If don't know why but this is a question for another place.\nBut the Ctrl+_ (which is actually Ctrl+Shift+- on my keyboard layout) is working properly.. Dup: gh-1136. I see.. LogFiles please. Contents of the \"Terminal modes\" status bar column in both cases?. I'm interested in LogFiles when \"WC\" was set unexpectedly.. Duplicate: gh-811, gh-1199. Fixed in 8a4ddcb. Of course. You are missing double quotes.. Where do you try to specify the icon? What do you have as result? Screenshots?. At last. Only now I understand that you are trying to do this from PowerShell console.\nYou shall learn how to execute commands in PowerShell. And ConEmu.exe -reuse -run is almost harmful.\n& powershell \"-new_console:C:`\"C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\\favicon.ico`\"\". Please read this: Third-party application problems\nAnd report this to git-bash authors.\nAFAIK this depends on the size of the console and have nothing to fix in ConEmu.. Unbelievable. I think you have not tested it thoroughly.\nProvide two process trees from \"working\" and \"not-working\" use cases. ProcessExplorer. Also\n\nThe situation is handled properly with Git bash 32 and 64 bit clients\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"git clients\"?\n\nIt's the 64 bit ConEmu client that has the problem.\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"ConEmu client\"? ConEmu doesn't contain any git binaries.. No sense to create duplicates.. Where is your Windows version?. ConEmu version?. http://conemu.github.io/blog/2017/11/17/Build-171117.html. The git option core.autocrlf is not related to this issue.. Short answer: modify CmdInit.cmd file. Seems like you use custom Windows theme?. @sgabenov This question was about ConEmu {cmd} task. It doesn't run clink prompt.\nActually, I dissuade users from using clink.. > If ran from cmd or git-bash using mintty \nTHIS is NOT fair comparison. ConEmu doesn't ruin node. From your screenshots I can make a conclusion you run bash. Report this to your bash bundle authors.\nThird-party application problems. Also you said: it runs from cmd.\nSo run cmd.exe in ConEmu (as shell) and check!. Just checked. And...\n\nIt is working with node 7.9.0. Regression in node?. ConEmu does not change environment variables while running applications.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/WindowsEnvironment.html. ConEmu doesn't change environment. And hooked GetEnvironmentVariable properly returns empty string.\nBut Node checks for non-zero GetLastError() instead of described ERROR_ENVVAR_NOT_FOUND.. It's all in docs: http://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html\nTL;DR - it's a required component to bypass conhost bugs and limitations.. Didn't understand anything. My output doesn't disappear.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html#Screenshot. What about current alpha?. @ecx86 Your zsh issue is different.\nI've asked @gelato about new alpha. Especially about running bash as default Task ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}.. > default settings\nI do not believe in that. Run the ConEmu with real default settings and recheck:\nPress Win+R and execute ConEmu64 -basic -run {cmd}.. Show screenshots at least. I do not see any problems on my side.. > Opening up the real console (win+ctrl+alt+space) shows the same effect with the cursor changing between a solid block and an underscore at about twice the rate to the normal cursor blinking.\nDid you click in RealConsole? If so, it's not a ConEmu who process the clicks, but your console shell, application or something else.. And what do you suggest?\nReport false positive to Antivirus developers.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/FalseAlarms.html. Developers physically can't do anything to anything to bypass suspiciousness of all possible antivirus authors.\nEven \"hello world\" may be detected as false positive.\nConEmu is rather complicated software which use code injection into spawned processes.\nAnd it's open source project.. Old Builds. There is a conhost bug, which become apparent when console window size is changed via API. It's not possible to disable reflow in conhost v2 which,  if I understand your problem correctly, raises drawing issues. /cc @miniksa\n. Update to latest alpha\nOld Builds. Try again, Show screenshots of ConEmu and Settings/Info page.. I have requested information from you.\nI can't try Docker.. AFAIK Docker for Windows requires HyperV. I don't want to install it.. I don't. I've installed VirtualBox.\nSo, you don't want to provide simple screenshots?. It looks like a race. \"xterm\" is expected in the second groupbox instead of \"win32\".\nI want to look at Log Files when you are able to reproduce the problem.. -new_console:p. Mode change is done automatically if ConEmu received ANSI sequences. For example, using default task {bash} runs WSL properly.. Did you check docs??\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/GuiMacro.html#TermMode. Please do git diff in your working folder and upload the patch. * https://conemu.github.io/en/MicrosoftBugs.html#ErasedWindows10\n* dup: gh-1164. > works in previous versions\nPrevious version of what?. Try to install build <= 170709 now and recheck.. Arrows are working properly.\nI will check the problem with tilde.. Let's move DeadKey conversation to gh-1224. I wonder, without ConEmu are you able to enter single dead key? For example, I have to type AltGr+~ twice to get two tildas printed. Is there a way to print one tilde?\nAs for arrows. It's all about turned on XTerm emulation. I thought race was fixed, but probably not completely.\nDoes not matter what is shown in tab title. MSYSTEM value has effect on bash profile scripts, but not a connector or ConEmu.\nIf you see arrows aren't working, open Settings/Info page and show screenshot here.. I can't reproduce the problem with arrow keys. On your first screenshot second groupbox shows \"win32|msys2\". To understand why it shows \"win32\" instead of \"xterm\" I need LogFiles reproducing the problem.\nCheck the option, save settings, and try to reproduce. When the problem appears, make a screenshot of Settings/Info and push here link to the logfles and screenshot.\n\n. Dup: gh-1031. ConEmu is terminal of \"general purpose\".\nIt was designed to run ANY console application and save user favorites in Tasks.\nI see no sense to create \"ssh connection page arguments\" because doesn't know how to connect to remote hosts.\nJust create ssh tasks!. ConEmu has never restored Far folders.. There are some chances.. Please show your ConEmu/About/SysInfo. It does work. What's the problem?. 1. Old Build!!\n2. Doesn't matter because if 1, but... \"Crashes\"? Who?. Why? It doesn't happen on actual build?. Please read you post and links and update.\nAlso, \"x64\" is NOT a version number!. I do initialize ssh-agent once per ConEmu instance in startup task. Than you do but need any special steps/scripts in profile. It works seamlessly.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SshAgent.html. My personal solution\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SshAgent.html#step-by-step. When you run ssh-agent from the bash profile, it stats as current console process and this prohibits console from termination. As I said before, my solution is to run ssh-agent separately, so you gain its keys in all tabs started in ConEmu regardless they are bash, cmd, powershell, whatever.... The option Kill ssh-agent with ConEmu works for this \"externally started\" ssh-agent.\nAlso, if you start ssh-agent from bash profile, and decide to start second bash tab, what happens in your case? If tabs shares one ssh-agent, then when you close first bash tab, second bash tab will lose ssh-agent abilities.. https://conemu.github.io/blog/2018/01/08/Build-180108.html. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\nThe issue is fixed long ago. Update and use predefined Tasks for bash instead of bash.exe!\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu\n. @nickjj Have you read my last comment and links? How do you run your console and what the shell you run?. No. It's correct task contents. One should use conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl to run connector/wslbridge.\n. As I've said, it's correct task contents.\nI don't know why cygwin pty loses connection with client side.. wslbridge Windows side is built with cygwin. So I don't understand your question.... Wslbridge is third-party tool built with cygwin. It is supplied with ConEmu distro along with cygwin1.dll. To run cygwin ConEmu starts appreciated connector.\nThere can't be conemu-wsl-64.exe.. I don't understand. Show illustrative screenshots.. ConEmu doesn't do text reflowing in the console. It just shows the content of the RealConsole.\nYou shall update to Win10 to get the feature.. I don't understand your problem.\nRun the installer manually and check installed features.. > The installer included with ConEmu won't work behind my proxy\nWhat? How the downloaded ConEmuSetup.exe may ever work with proxy? It is the installer. It doesn't even try to use any internet resources.. Well, step by step\n\nDownload installer\nRun installer\nChoose Change mode\nCheck all desired features are on. Dude, I feel you ignore my recommendations. If so, why do you write here?\nYou MUST run installer MANUALLY to check proper features.\nHow many times I have to repeat that?. 1. ConEmu doesn't show the version in the title bar\nIf you really update ConEmu from choco to 17.8.19.0 you shall see in the About box 170819.\nObviously old 161022 means the installer did not updated your executable.\n\nDude. Do the steps I wrote before. Until than our conversation would be meaningless.. ConEmu installer is just an MSI package which install features selected by user.. About box is on it's usual place: https://conemu.github.io/en/AboutDialog.html\nI don't understand tge point of the thread. Version is visible in MANY places. Even in the StatusBar which is visible immediately after ConEmu start. Nothing to do at all.. This is not \"out of focus\".\nThis is \"flash window\".\nAnd the flash is a visual signal instead of beep. This is by option and by design.. That is not a ConEmu issue.\n@miniksa can you check this?. As not ConEmu generates these messages I can't do anything to stop them.. IsKeyboardLayoutChanged is a good place.\nOf course it would be much better if console applications have proper API to determine the keyboard layout. Nowadays there is absolutely no way to do that. Standard GUI functions aren't working for obvious reason, console variant was broken in Win10.. PR was not successful.\nAt the moment only commit 1638b9b5 fixes it, but there is no corresponding build yet.. You shall add \"-new_console:a\" to your command line (started from TC).\nOn August 28, 2017 10:33:05 Lab 313 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm using Total commander in non admin mode.\nI want to run 'cmd' from the TC command prompt.\nIt starts usual ConEmu, but I've registered Admin task as default for new \nconsoles.\nIs it possible to request admin rights for such case?\n--\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1237\n. I don't know what do you run from Win+R and TC.\nWithout details I can't say more.. Win+R with cmd must not run the tab in Admin mode. So you have configured something outside of ConEmu, and I can't suppose what exactly.\nTry ProcessExplorer to compare started instances.. At this image you only configured the Task {cmd (Admin). It has nothing in common with \"run default ConEmu in admin mode\". Obviously running cmd from Win+R do not run this task.. You request contrary things.\nYou ask \"run cmd.exe in ConEmu\" but in fact want to \"run the task {cmd (Admin)} in ConEmu\".\nDecide what do you want in fact and run \"ConEmu\" from Win+R if you'd like to start ConEmu's default task.. So, why don't you run \"ConEmu\" instead of \"cmd\" to get what you want?. That is due to http://conemu.github.io/en/MicrosoftBugs.html#ErasedWindows10\n\nThere's no way to know if colors were broken or the are invisible by design.. Legacy mode is RealConsole property, it doesn't exist in ConEmu settings.\nResize occurs in many cases, not only user-triggered window resize: splitting panes, lock screen, monitor changes... It has awful consequences in current Win10.. 180416?. I think you chose wrong site to request help on Gradle config.\nThe only thing I can say, connector emulates posix tty properly, just because it's built on top of cygwin tty API.\nPerhaps your Gradle don't know TERM variable ConEmu exports. But the same value is exported by many other terminals.\nReport to Gradle.. I think you misunderstood the tty detection.\nThe code mentioned above is a detection if the current input/output handles are handles to WinAPI conhost handles.\nObviously when you run connector (or mintty) the current handles are not WinAPI capable. They are \"true\" posix tty handles. That means that application must use ANSI sequences for communication with terminal API.. What do you want to check? If the terminal supports ANSI on Windows?\nIf so, one may check for environment variable ConEmuANSI or ANSICON.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuEnvironment.html\nWhen ConEmuANSI is ON defined, application is allowed to write ANSI sequences.. Application which was not built with cygwin/msys can't determine if there is POSIX tty on pipe handles.\nWell, they may load cygwin1.dll or msys-2.0.dll and call their functions but that is VERY complicated.\nI can suggest solutions for ConEmu only.\nPerhaps it would be better to implement some switch in your tool (e.g. --color) to force progress and colors in any terminal.\nHmm... Also I may try to redirect API calls to \"real\" handles, but all processes spawned from connector are free from ConEmuHk and you shall run them via ConEmuC -c ... to get them detoured.. BTW, there is command ConEmuC -IsRedirect which returns 1 as errorlevel if CONOUT is redirected, 2 if not.\nBut I'm not sure if it works in connector, I think it doesn't now.\nAnyway, this is a solution for ConEmu only.. I thought it was fixed. To \"unfreeze\" you switch tabs.. That is by design. User expects the opened console ready to execute commands when they run a shell.. Switch -min worked for the first instance for an obvious reason: minimize action was not passes to first instance from newly runned one.\nBy the way, why do you run tabs via -reuse switch? How do you run python scripts? Why don't use -new_console instead?. Did you ignored new ConEmu build?\nTo run set of tabs simultaneously you may use -runlist switch.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuArgs.html\nThe -new_console would run tabs inside the same window where the script is running.. I don't understand why the -title flag suddenly appeared.\nIf you \"reuse\" some window, it would be logical to reuse it at whole, with all settings and the title of course.. You may use GuiMacro to create new tab in the specified window. It's upon your script to select it.. It was expected that when user presses the \"Startup dir...\" button the cursor was set at the end of the command. What did you do? Can you reproduce?\nIf you can't reproduce... It would be interesting to examine the dump. Use DropBox or something. Only dump. Logging have to be enabled explicitly to generate LogFiles.. @alexdevero Please read what is this issue about. ChildGui\nAnd report your desired behavior to node.js authors.. > The line break is defined by the width of the ConEmu window and rendered also by ConEmu.\nDefinitely not. ConEmu is terminal, it shows what your node.js prints, and it's node.js choice when to do line break.\nThat is NOT a gap defined by scrollbar\nThe reported bug (this issue) for ChildGui was fixed year ago.\nYou problem is related to node.js (configuration or anything) and is offtopic here.. Only two levels are supported. Restart tab. Run ConEmu.exe -basic and choose default task for your shell.\nANSI is working properly in current version.. For example, run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {Bash::Git bash} and you'll see properly colored prompt.\nIf so, report the bug to stack's authors.. What do you mean by \"cmd32\", \"ran regularly\" or \"run zsh from an admin cmd\"?\nI told you to check something and you didn't answer.\n. Show your ConEmu settings, Features page.\nShow dir \"%ConEmuBaseDir% in both \"working\" and \"broken\" consoles.. The file is obsolete!\n06.06.2017.  00:03           353.504 ConEmuHk64.dll. So?

I believe the hijacking of OS security system is wrong way and I would not give ability to do that via ConEmu, it may be used by third-party software.\nIf you want to eliminate UAC confirmation, run ConEmu under admin.. It's very simple to check.\nInstead of Franz try to attach standard \"notepad.exe\". I believe there would not be any problems  with Firefox. . ChildGui support is a side feature and it works if the GUI application \"supports\" embedding.\nInitially you reported a problem of ctrl-tab in application running outside of ConEmu, don't you? . Looks like Franz intercepts your keyboard. ConEmu can't do anything with that. . As I've said before, ChildGui is advanced feature and keyboard behavior can't be guaranteed because it depends on third-party GUI application.\nKeyboard events are processed by Windows and posted into the window input queue which has focus at the moment.\nWhen you run console application in ConEmu, the behavior is predictable, because ConEmu has full control over focus.\nBut with ChildGui ConEmu can't guarantee anything.\nPlease read docs for more information.. Read carefully what is written in the https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html#connector-ps1\nAnd check what ConEmu* variable exist in your host.\nAt last, use preview at least, stable is old! .

ConEmu creates default tasks for all installed bash shells for you itself.\nEven if you want to copy connector (as per 1 it's not required), you shall not copy msys-2.0.dll anywhere! You break your git installation!\n. Docs are updated less frequently that distro. Have you read the link I've posted? I doubt...\n\nRun ConEmu64.exe -basic and check tasks.\nDo you use Git-for-Windows v2.x? Seems like.\nIf so, git/bin shall contain only three files: bash.exe, git.exe, sh.exe. No msys-2.0.dll. This file breaks your msys2 installation.\nGit 1.x had different structure and obsolete method worked with this obsolete git distro.. Yep, docs have to be updated. But that takes time, and it's almost impossible to reread all these pages to maintain them. So any help, PR, or smth from users is appreciated.\nAll installations if git-for-windows v2 I have have not msys-2.0.dll in git/bin. Correct place of the file is git/usr/bin. If you look in .exe files in the git/bin, you'll see that they aren't linked with msys2, they are native Windows console binaries by design, they are just a wrappers for binaries in git/usr/bin. When you run smth linked with msys2, this msys-2.0.dll treats its location as POSIX \"root\" and search for initialization files from there. Obviously, all proper files are installed relatively to git/usr/bin, and msys2 loaded from git/bin will fail almost completely.. \"Add/refresh default tasks\" is rather long, I don't consider it as an option.\nParagraph \"Add default tasks\" clearly states \"new applications\" and tells you press \"Add default tasks\".

Ah, I see now. Definitely a bug.. @yxliang01 In latest alpha build?. Isn't -title switch is suitable for you?. https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuArgs.html. Not correct.

Yes, modifiers can't be used as single hotkeys.\nI don't understand your question about left/right generalization.... You didn't say what action you have tried.\nSo I may only guess that its type is Global.\nThan it's expected behavior due to WinAPI limitation..

You may use \"-cur_console:m: \" as temp workaround, it would use a space as prefix.. The correct solution: -cur_console:m:\"\" ;). What did you compare with? Where.profile is working. This looks like Microsoft bug.\nIf you run wsl.exe there's no way to trigger .profile.. If you had installed previously bash.exe (legacy WSL), did you uninstall it by lxrun /uninstall?\nAs for me, legacy version blocked .profile from loading by wsl.exe.. The same is done automatically by connector. 12 days ago.. Connector is bundled into ConEmu. Wasn't it updated in alpha?. @rolandas-valantinas Your question is offtopic because your .inputrc is read definitely.\n\"Normal\" Ubuntu keys have two encoding modes, and when you have checked AppKeys you get ^[OA, when AppKeys are off - ^[[A..

When your task fails, please run ConEmu with -log switch, reproduce the problem with \"El sistema no puede encontrar el archivo especificado\" and attach LogFiles here.\n\nI see weird dots after ConEmu in the executed command. Was it paste error or the path is really broken?\nC:\\Program Files\\ConEmu..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe.. Fixed in docs. This is not a ConEmu bug. ConEmu displays text using attributes returned by conhost WinAPI.\nAnd in the first block I receive proper COMMON_LVB_REVERSE_VIDEO|COMMON_LVB_UNDERSCORE|0x40, but in the second block (after \"correct sl to ...\") I get erroneous COMMON_LVB_REVERSE_VIDEO|COMMON_LVB_UNDERSCORE|0x04.\nObviously because of COMMON_LVB_REVERSE_VIDEO I inverse the 0x04 and you see black text on colored background.\n@agross When you use proper task with connector/wslbridge you may see proper colors and underlined text in both cases.\n@miniksa Can you check that? Looks like a bug in conhost, because the RealConsole window displays proper colors in both cases, but API returns broken attributes.. The following is working in my tests\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDir%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & \"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" --wsl -t /usr/bin/zsh -i -l -cur_console:p:m:/mnt\n. -t is a switch of wslbridge. Bare --wsl implies it.. What command line did you test exactly?. Yes, of course. Your command is not \"bare --wsl\".. If you do specify any arguments after --wsl all these arguments are passed to wslbridge without changes, in your case it's /usr/bin/zsh --interactive --login. ConEmu doesn't modify them.. I said \"bare --wsl\". The \"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" --wsl implies -t!. All -cur_ and -new_console switches are processed by ConEmu internally! Connector doesn't receive them.\n-new_console\n. As I said before\n\nin your case it's /usr/bin/zsh --interactive --login\n. Exactly. I don't know how to explain it shorter.. > Also, one missing feature is setting ConEMU's cursor color/type. This can be controlled by ANSI codes usually, but it doesn't seem like there's a way to set the default color or shape.\n\nYou may change the cursor shape with ANSI. Color of the cursor is not configurable.\nIf option Color (inverse screen part under cursor shape) is turnen on - ConEmu uses pattern to inverse area under the cursor. If option is off - either 0 or 15 color is used (depends on dark or light background).\n\nAlso, it would be nice to see an explanation for why blue, yellow, and cyan have two numbers next to them, and also what popup and popup background do in ANSI mode.\n\nANSI color indexes are not compliant with standard Windows console color palette. So the first index is RealConsole (WinApi) palette index and second index - is ANSI index.\nSo the \"blue\" would be either \"34\" for text, or \"44\" for background color.\nSame for \"intense\" part, but I didn't add second index there.\nOf course, for intense you may use \"94\" and \"104\" or BrightOrBold ANSI flag.\nAs usual, PR to documentation are appreciated.. I consider this is incorrect approach.\nIf you run some console application in ConEmu tab, you need ability to view its output. Supposing your console never would have any output is wrong - errors, warnings, whatever...\nIf you are sure your server will never output anything (really?) You have two ways\n\nrun your server outside of ConEmu windowless completely\nrun server in the same console where your client is running\n. > Commands like ssh or plink do not provide a feature to run completely windowless, they do require the console, unfortunately.\n\nThat is not true. Any console application may be started either windowless or hidden (if they really require console window, I doubt).\nI believe both solutions I suggested are possible. And you didn't comment on sharing solution.. > The main issue that needs to be addressed is one of user interaction.\nSame as I said above. So the hidden server may require user input. But you says it does not. If so, server may be started in hidden window.\nI don't know what do you trying to run exactly, so all my suggestIons are theoretic.. Your description is still not complete. Do you run two or more commands one by one?\nplink REMOTE_HOST -D LOCAL_HOST:PORT\nplink LOCAL_HOST:PORT. You can.\nRun ConEmuC -? and read about asynchronous execution..

Just checked in my test Win7 and I see no issues with console window.

Do you have Visual Studio on your work PC? Or actually any other tool which may show the information (class, process, etc.) of your \"tool window\"?.

Everything (except -new_console) after --wsl is passed directly to wslbridge, so I believe there are spare flags in the solution.. What was the error message?. Why do you pass this - as argument? Simple --distro-guid={3d833ab2-222f-4e10-8ceb-d56423d90556} is enough addition.\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl --distro-guid={3d833ab2-222f-4e10-8ceb-d56423d90556} -cur_console:pm:/mnt. Have you read docs?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#wsl-distro. Don't you use {cmd} task?\nJust append /git switch.. Show the screenshot. Setup / Integration / ANSI execution. And man, you have rather old build, update to preview! That's may be the problem!. Build 171117 has been released.\nIt contains latest connector and I hope connector Tasks are working properly now.. I have no idea what's happening\nIn coming builds of Windows and ConEmu it would be possible to eliminate spare layers (connector+wslbridge) and the problem should gone. Details please, in the new issue.. So what is the problem?. How do you run your shell and what shell exactly? How do you run ConEmu?\nHint: Elevated or restricted accounts may have different SID preventing communication.. Personally, I'm using ssh-agent without any problems in ConEmu consoles.. And you didn't show your output from command described in the hint.. Each page has \"Suggest better edit\" link\n\n. 1. I do not observe malformed pasted text. Perhaps your description is not complete.\n2. Reports for stable build 161206 has almost no value. It was released a year ago and new stable will be released soon.\n3. If you do not use connector+bridge (standard {bash} task generated for you by ConEmu, most issues are not related to ConEmu at all.\nFurther troubleshooting is required from you\n\nDue to settings from the issue, the selected text is immediately placed into Windows clipboard. So, you may ensure that it's OK by starting Notepad (for example) and paste the text there after step 1.\nYou click in the terminal in step 2. What for? You may press right mouse button immediately. Moreover, left-click has no sense - it just resets the selection, \"cursor\" is not changed with left-click at that moment. The same you may do with Esc key. Anyway, you shall to validate clipboard contents after step 2. Go to notepad and do the paste.\nAt last. If the clipboard contents is OK, run the command ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd /d from Win+R, and try to paste some certain text (copy it from Notepad or so). In my tests I have no glitches in 100% of tries. But I'm using Win 10 version 1709 (build 16299.19).. Just created test build of connector.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/m1fpkw3kei2wgre/conemu-cyg-64.exe.1.2.3.7z?dl=0\n\nWith --log switch it dumps all received input to connector-XXXX-in.log in the same directory where connector is located (%ConEmuBaseDirShort%). So the test variant of {Bash::bash} is:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --log --wsl -cur_console:pnm:/mnt -t bash -l\nIt's intersting what would you see in the log after consequtive Ctrl-V, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-C, ...\nPerpahs this issue is related to gh-1311.. So, your problem was in the stable build. I suggested to update it previously.\nThis issue is closed. Locked console is discussed in gh-1311.. What shall I write to avoid old-builds-issues? The message is not clear?\n\n. @ronindesign \n\nYou should define what an old build is, instead of using a relative / ambiguous term.\n\nBut there is the definition in the screenshot (issue template).\nConEmu versions has following format `YYMMDD`, so if you are using old build,\nthere are chances that your problem was fixed long ago.\n\nIn any case, this issue relates to all the builds up through current alpha...\n\nBut that is not confirmed. Or do you mean freezes?\n@conan \n\nSorry, I rely on ConEmu so much for daily productivity that I'm generally not prepared to be running anything but stable builds.\n\nThat's clear and that's why I recommend to use Preview builds. Personally I'm using Alpha ;)\n\nOnly when running bash using the file you sent (above) was the problem resolved, \n\nI believe that if you take connector from the Preview and use Default task {Bash::bash} you'll see the same behavior.\n\nbut I experienced a far worse problem (freeze) which prevents me from using it. Is this problem fixed in an alpha build?\n\nAt the moment there are no build newer than Preview.. @gijsk \n\nI see the same issues with copy/paste in the preview build\n\nIf you don't use connector, it's not a ConEmu issue.. It depends on many factors.\nWhen you run some application without ConEmu, you see the conhost window and all input (Windows WM_CHAR and others) is translated into console events internally by Windows kernel (conhost) without using WinAPI.\nSecond. When you run application in ConEmu, I have absolutely no other way to post key sequences into console input buffer than Windows console API (conhost doesn't use it). Moreover, there are many ways to read that input and it depends on the console application which API function is use.\nThird. In the issue there are confirmations that in some configurations there is no input loss (freezes is offtopic here). So it can't be obvious ConEmu bug, because I always use one way (defined console API) to post keypresses in the console input queue. If the console application can't read correct input, that means the queue is broken inside conhost.\nFourth, when you don't use connector (why? all cygwin/msys/wsl default tasks created by ConEmu use it), I have less control over console processes. Actually, when you run WSL without connector - absolutely no control.\nAt last. I'm not sure, comments are messed up, but seems like messed input was detected in the last insider builds of Windows 10. And the issues doesn't depends on ConEmu build (stable was released about a year ago).\nAll these reasons make me almost sure, that this is a Microsoft bug, like this known and reported.\n@miniksa Can you verify that?. No need to download anything. Connector is included in the latest builds and default tasks are created for you.\nConEmu64.exe -basic for check.. Nope. As I understand, current issue is occurred with ConEmu and bash for Windows.\nUnfortunately, neither user have provided exact command line they use.\nHm, now I understand that repro steps are absent in the issue.\nTo check further we need the command, the versions and the steps.\nFor example\n\nRun ConEmu.exe -basic -run wsl.exe\nPaste the string bla bla bla using Ctrl-V dozen of times.... Build 171117 has been released.\nIt would not fix paste dropped characters problem in bare wsl, but it contains latest connector and I hope connector Tasks are working properly now..

When exactly the diary occurs? Video?\nWhat if you run wsl.exe instead of task with connector?. Try to add --verbose switch before the --wsl. Try to monitor process creation. The lag occurs on certain step, but outside of ConEmu code.\nTry ProcessMonitor or ProcessExplorer. \nAlso, perhaps logs from ConEmu64.exe -basic -log -run {bash} may show something..

AFAIK there is a bundle with mintty.. Yes, I don't have any delay.\nWhat about wsltty, did you check it as I asked?\nBTW, do you have git or cygwin installed on your computer?. What about wsl.exe started without ConEmu? Delay?\nIt looks like the delay occurs after connector runs exec on wslbridge.exe (from your log). ProcessMonitor shows when the exe is started, and you may see from its log what process contains the lag.\nIf it's in wslbridge, you shall report this to wslbridge author.\nVisualStudio is not useful to debug cygwin applications.\nI've asked about cygwin because it's interesting to compare startup time of wsl and bash from cygwin.. @rprichard Do you have any idea what to test further?. Process id\n. Because the process is changed?. The message from wslbridge itself (wslbridge.cc:845). Antivirus/defender?. Perhaps it's related to https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/981\nAnyway, it's out of ConEmu responsibilities. I don't know the reason of the problem.. BTW, adding conemu-cyg-64.exe and wslbridge.exe to Windows Defender exceptions may significantly decrease delays.\nI don't think ConEmu may do anything with them. @elijahgagne Have you tested wslbridge without ConEmu?. Anyway, I hope in the nearest future, when new PTY interface become public, ConEmu will run WSL directly, without wslbridge.. Have you tried wsltty or started wslbridge from conhost?. Wsl has different supported switches. Better for what?\nThe only proper way to run WSL is described in BashOnWindows in ConEmu. May be this issue is related to gh-1841. @kbirger Are you definite about same command lines for wsl task in Cmder and ConEmu instances? Just to be sure that they both run wsl via connector? Have they both same height of the buffer?\nI hope so, than there are some Windows options that ConEmu doesn't control.\nFirst thing that comes to mind - RealConsole settings.\nPlease open conhost settings in both instances (either from ConEmu SystemMenu/Debug or from shown conhost window) and compare them.. If you are experiencing the same delay in both instances - no sense in comparing properties.\nYou may try to copy whole ConEmu folder to new location and run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}. Please try 190310.\nIf the delay is still noticable, please make logs from both ConEmu and connector.\n ConEmu: run it with switch -log\n connector: modify {bash} task adding --log before --wsl.. @kbirger Shell completion is not related to alternative buffer, it operates in primary buffer only. Another issue.. Disable lazy tabs switching.. Dup: gh-1322. \n. Connector is bundled with ConEmu. Don't use old versions.. Docs have to be updated.\nConEmu creates default tasks with connector, you may check them. Copying is bad approach nowadays.. It is to complicated to hook ITaskbarList3 interface and it doesn't worth the time.\nJust show your progress in the console window title and ConEmu will catch it automatically.

On your screenshot I see gaps between _ _ _. If you didn't enter spaces that means that _ is shorter than a cell and gap between _ and the cursor is expected.. The commit mentioned wrong issue.. No. I have not yet checked it. That is because connector acts as \"remote terminal\". Previous version, which had no lags, had much worse problem - freezed input.. It's upon a chance when your terminal freezes in 171109.

Why don't you run ls in git-bash? Or why don't you run wsl-bash shell?. It's strange that git is slow in wsl. Perhaps this have to be reported in BashForWindows issue tracker?. I have to check this. No and no.\n\nIf you downloaded 7z package and were able to unpack it, that means you already have 7-zip on your computer.\nEven if I ship 7za within ConEmu it will not be able to unpack newer 7-zip format when it changes at some moment.\nI don't like the idea of having a megabyte of code in ConEmu (as library) just for unpacking. And the same note about format change.\n\nIf one don't want to install 7-zip, they may use installer which does not require any third-party software.\nThe original issue is resolved.. Run ConEmu64.exe -log, scroll wheel fast back and forward few times, push logs here.. Old Builds\n. @marwatk Don't mix issues. WSL is completely different subsystem and you should read docs first.. BTW, when you run Code from ConEmu it deliberately inherits (I believe erroneously) StdIn/Out handles from parent process. . Comparison is not fair. Show the RealConsole from the moment when some text is not visible and compare there.\n. ConEmu shows what console application tells to it.\nIf your application (react-native) has branches in code due to ANSI detection, this may be a bug in this application but not in ConEmu.\nTurn on ANSI logging, start new console (tab), repeat your command and upload here link to generated log file.. Your link is not working. Please use gist instead.. In the log I don't see ANSI sequences before UP-TO-DATE, so react is using WinApi (it's not logged).\nI need more thorough steps to reproduce, I'm not a react user.\nJFI\n```\n\nping zikro.gr\nPing request could not find host zikro.gr. Please check the name and try again.\n```. In your last log there are following lines\n\n[30m\u001b[40m:app:installDebug \u001b[33m\u001b[40mFAILED\u001b\nThat means black on black for \":app:installDebug\", isn't it?\n. As I said, if application determines ANSI capable terminal, it uses ANSI, if not (no ConEmu) - it switches to another code brunch and uses WinApi. Report to authors buggy ANSI output.\nIf you disable ConEmuHk don't you see these unprocessed ANSI sequences? I didn't understand you.. > What is exactly that you don't understand?\nSimple thing. If your first log https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1342#issuecomment-349022745 there are no ANSI in the line with :app:preReleaseBuild UP-TO-DATE. Absolutely. But there are ANSI above (cmd prompt and line with Running C:\\Dev\\Android\\sdk/platform-tools/adb).\nIn your second comment https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1342#issuecomment-349084922 there are ANSI codes in the line \u001b[30m\u001b[40m:app:preReleaseBuild \u001b[33m\u001b[40mUP-TO-DATE\u001b[37m\u001b[40m. And these codes are produced not by ConEmu but by your console tool, aren't they?\nI don't know what was the difference in your settings between these two logs. That is what I don't understand.\n\nIf you think this is not a ConEmu bug\n\nOf course. \u001b[30m\u001b[40m means black on black and that what ConEmu displays to you. Do you agree that this code is produced by react-native? I hope so, it's obvious. ConEmu must not change output produced by console applications, thats why you see black text on black background.\nI told you several times, that it's upon react-native to decide which API they use: ANSI or WinAPI. ConEmu has no control over it.\nAnd instead of reporting the problem with their ANSI to react-native authors you decided to disable major part of ConEmu features. Well, it's your decision.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html\n. Seems lime you just don't hear me.\n\nWho prints ANSI codes? Don't you think it's the ConEmu?\nThese ANSI codes tells ConEmu to use black on black. Aren't they?\n\nPlease tell me do you accept these assertions or want to argue them?. > I am still waiting you to answer my questions\nAnd you ignore mine questions.\n\nWhen the cmd.exe prints, doesn't it get ANSI code sequences? \n\nWhy do you think it does? Did you check that? Did you seen them? Again. The application may use WinAPI instead of ANSI. Only authors or debugger may say what happens there.\n\nWhen ConEmu prints without the Hk injection, doesn't it use ANSI code sequences? Why does it print without any issues?\nSo, here are the ANSI codes with the Hk injection disabled\n\nWhat? Where did you take these ANSI codes??? If you disable ConEmuHk, you ConEmu ANSI logging is not working. Sorry, but your assertions doesn't look reliable.\nIf you see these codes in the console you can't insist that there are no issues.\n\nAs you can see, there is 37 Foreground and 40 for Background colors which is white text on black background. How do you explain that?\n\nDo you insist that ConEmu CHANGES the data console application prints? Do you really believe I specially make you life harder by changing correct 37 to wrong 30? ConEmu is open source, you may easily check my code.\nRead this article, you may find it interesting\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. > Still waiting an answer why it works without Hk injection and why it does not with it enabled.\nSo I need to dig the react-native and gradle projects, examine their codes, learn how to debug them and try to understand why they push 30 instead of 37? How do you estimite the time I need to pay to create a possible PR to these projects?\nBTW, you issue has something in common with https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2724 . > Once again I will tell you that this is not true, because if that would be true, then that would be the case even for cmd Windows and ConEmu with Hk injection. How many times do I have to write that thing?\nHow many times I have to write that application or library may (and often has) different branches of the code (if else statement). And the code for ConEmu may be different! Why this statement is so hard to understand?\nThe same was with Docker and well, I spent my personal time to create a PR to the DOCKER!\n\nYes I can see them, because I am a developer with plenty of knowledge\n\nSo you may easily set a breakpoint in the ConEmu code at functions CEAnsi::OurWriteConsoleA or CEAnsi::OurWriteConsoleW to ensure that ConEmuHk doesn't do any magic changing 37 to 30.\n. Assume some application works in Windows 7 but crashes in Windows 10. What would you do? Report to Microsoft that Windows 10 is broken or tell the application authors that they have problems with Win10? What report would have the effect?\nWell, I don't insist that ConEmu is completely bugless, but your issue let me think that something in the react-native or its libraries works in unexpected way in ConEmu. And their authors have much much more chances to understand what! They known how their product works, but not me.. > To be clear. Then you did it (Copy All) the ConEmu converted\nThat is a total surprise. I asked to to make ANSI logs via ConEmu interface, to get REAL ANSI output from your console application.\nSo I can't trust any logs you attached before because they are just representation of ALREADY PRINTED data. That was not I asked for.\nBut I asked to to get RAW ANSI codes to check if there is something wrong!!!\nMoreover, I asked to to create a step-by-step guide to reproduce your problem. Where is it? I need to learn manuals how to create the app, how to configure it, how to run it?. I'm afraid I will surprise you. \n\nDo you know what is react-native? Yep, it's a js script executed by node.\nDo you know what is node.exe? Yep, it's a Windows executable.\nWhat would you see, if you run dumpbin /imports:kernel32.dll node.exe?\n\nSurprise: 20 functions from Windows console API. Do you still think it prints ANSI codes to ConOut?\nFillConsoleOutputAttribute\nFillConsoleOutputCharacterW\nFlushConsoleInputBuffer\nGetConsoleCP\nGetConsoleCursorInfo\nGetConsoleMode\nGetConsoleScreenBufferInfo\nGetConsoleTitleW\nGetNumberOfConsoleInputEvents\nReadConsoleInputA\nReadConsoleInputW\nReadConsoleW\nSetConsoleCtrlHandler\nSetConsoleCursorInfo\nSetConsoleCursorPosition\nSetConsoleMode\nSetConsoleTextAttribute\nSetConsoleTitleW\nWriteConsoleInputW\nWriteConsoleW\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/Localization.html.

That is but a ConEmu build.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html#Software_version. No details in the issue.. You should describe repro steps at least.. I will check. At the moment, I think that ConsoleZ doesn't do real \"pasting\", but instead post a WinAPI message into conhost window.\nI do not consider this trick as solution because it is not synchronous, it does not work the same way as normal key typing, it does not support bracketed paste, and more.\nConEmu do the real work.. What is the purpose of pasting such long texts? I don't understand the use case in console terms.. BTW, the fast workaround is to show RealConsole and do paste there.. There is https://conemu.github.io/en/MicrosoftBugs.html#BrokenText\n. @AjawadMahmoud What? Didn't understand anything.. 1. I didn't change anything about keytyping or pasting.\nAll previous builds are available for download as 7z packages and you may check them all to compare behavior.\nBroken input shell be addressed to Microsoft unless you are using the wsl connector.. As I said before. When you run bash without wslbridge its paste behavior is bad and undetermined (it may works properly occasionally). It looks like a race condition in Windows wrapper called bash.exe. And it must be fixed by Microsoft.. You may define alias to run wsl in new ConEmu tab.\n\nI think you misunderstood WSL. Windows Subsystem for Linux is developed by Microsoft+Canonical engineers. Obviously your argument about PowerShell is not actual. Also bash.exe is not a \"bash\", it's just a bootstrapper for WSL, actually there is wsl.exe which do absolutely the same thing.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html. All off-topic comments will be deleted from the thread. Please stop posting here WSL related questions.. > In Cmder, one can press ctrl+shift+v to have the same 180 chars appear instantly\nI think this is not related to cmder. Hotkey is processed by clink, and that means that ConEmu (cmder) does not send keypressed at all, clink just get clipboard contents at once.. I can't be sure what happens on your side (no screenshots), but in Win 8.1 behavior of ConEmu x32 and x64 are absolutely the same.\n\nConEmu doesn't \"print\" replacement characters, instead, it calls WinAPI to draw strings and your results may depend on certain font or even problems in Windows GDI32.\n. Your font may have certain glyphs and then GDI does not draw replacement character instead of them.. ConEmu uses absolutely the same methods to draw glyphs. You may check it yourself...\nIf the difference comes from font, the problem may be in the font, isn't it?. I don't see if fcw is open-source or not.\nBut ConEmu is.\nThe error message you see doesn't come from ConEmu, looks like fcw shows it (no screenshots, yep).\nBased on this I think you should contact fcw author.. ConEmu doesn't have GetWin function. ConEmu doesn't export GetWin function. The message comes from fcw and its codebase should be investigated.\nAlso you say \"display is mangled\" but did not provide screenshots. From both ConEmu and RealConsole.. From what I see, File Commander tries to change size of terminal window instead working in existing environment. What it will do, if user runs terminal maximized I wonder?. I have no idea what happened with your msi, just checked and x64 msi updater is working properly\n\nDownload 170910: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/download/v17.09.10/ConEmuSetup.170910.exe\nRun its manually choosing x64 part and choose Remove\nAfter that install current version: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/download/v17.12.17/ConEmuSetup.171217.exe.

Try to run {cmd} instead of {powershell}. What happens?. Than it's not a ConEmu problem.\nTo be sure, in that {cmd} console (are you in C:\\T[e]st?) run powershell.exe and see what happens.. PowerShell must retain the current directory of the parent process. And it does on my PC regardless of brackets in dir name.\nTry PowerShell.exe -noprofile.. This should be forwarded to Microsoft PowerShell team.. The last check: did you try to run PowerShell from cmd from T[e]st without ConEmu?. It's recommended to post your issue in the Microsoft Community forum for advance troubleshooting about your issue on powershell: https://goo.gl/oGbY7a. ChildGui is advanced feature with limitations.\nRequested way to start applications would be asynchronous and will raise bugs and race conditions, I don't like this way.\nIt would be better to ask vim authors to use proper colors for menu bar.\nAnyway, personally I don't see any difference between started gvim's.. > so is there any difference between the two ways to start a program?\nThe difference is in --windowid, I don't know what gvim does to process this switch and what it changes.

Have you tried ConEmu.exe -basic -run cmd?\nAnyway, ConEmu doesn't draw on \"desktop\" canvas, it always uses DC of its own windows, so it looks like a bug of video driver or GDI subsystem..

And what is the question?\nBad Issues. I spent a lot of time writing docs. But some things obvious to me (as an author) may be missed from documentation, or they are not easily accessed via hyperlinks or so. Each page has \"suggest better edit\" at the bottom and PR are appreciated.\n\nThe wiki page related to Vim (and actually all third party tools) is my gesture of goodwill, the place where my users may find some hints how to configure their console tools.\nYou are right, ConEmu is a terminal, it is not required to turn on xterm colors in Vim. But why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\nEnabling XTerm in ConEmu (some techinfo is here) just tells the terminal to post keyboard and mouse events as XTerm sequences. Simple. Nothing else.\nUnless you enable XTerm in console application, this console application will not use XTerm/ANSI sequences to output colored text. But in most applications enabling XTerm mouse/keyboard means enabling XTerm colors. Logical.\nUser is not obliged to enable XTerm to get console application working with mouse. Just take a look at Far Manager - properly written Windows console application using WinAPI.\n\n\nwhy does conemu show incorrect color(I guess it's still xterm 256) after disabling inject, xterm, true color mode the three options?\n\nIf you cut the monitor cable, the monitor would not show anything. Unfortunately.\nTechInfo here: https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html\n. I'm lost.\nWhat do you want?\na) let Vim write ANSI sequences to output colors?\nb) let Vim receive ANSI sequences as mouse and keyboard events?\n. > disabling XTerm and letting vim's non-XTerm colors works if users don't use mouse.\nI completely can't understand you. What is your problem? Just use Vim with default config.\nAs I said before:\n Enabling or disabling XTerm in ConEmu have effect on keyboard/mouse sequences only.\n If you don't turn on XTerm, Vim doesn't use XTerm colors.. No description. So I suppose you showed screenshot with non-XTerm colors in cmder, and with-XTerm colors in Vim.\nBy XTerm colors here I mean 256 (or higher) color palette.\nThat is correct. So, what do you want to configure?. You are missing a screenshot at least.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html. @SamHasler Don't mix issues. Create your one with thorough description.. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsChildGui.html#id2568. Three is an option in ConEmu allowing to set focus in ChildGui. The problem is that users expect Ctrl-Tab is working out of the box, there were a lot of reports. That's why the option appeared.\nAnyway, ChildGui is a side feature with a lot of limitations and I warn users about that in docs.\nConsole analogues are preferable.. Nobody reads docs, I know\nBest practice to run cygwin in ConEmu - install ConEmu and just choose the Task precreated for you, e.g. {Bash::Cygwin Bash}. It runs bash.exe which is console application.\nI've written about ChildGui and Tasks many times in docs, and I'm sure docs contains all required information. E.g. https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html and subtopics.\nIf you may suggest improvements - PR are welcome.\nAbout \"analogues\". Running mintty in ConEmu is something like installing Windows ==> Virtual Box ==> and Windows guest. The guest OS is working, but it has completely different settings and things. Host OS can't do anything with guest OS.\n. @mintty Checking this issue now on Windows 8.1 and mintty does not receive WM_MOUSEACTIVATE. Selections just does not work... BTW, DoubleClick selects the word, but dragging mouse cursor does nothing.. I can only repeat.\nConEmu doesn't send WM_MOUSEACTIVATE message\nAnd I don't see WM_MOUSEACTIVATE in mintty input message queue on any of my PCs\n. TaskBarGhost serves only clicks on the Taskbar aero thumbnails. Of course they don't occurs without user clicks on this thumbnails!\nLook, I don't say that you don't receive the event.\nI say that ConEmu doesn't send it and I don't see it in mintty GetMessage/PeekMessage queue. I've specially attached debugger to the mintty process and ... nothing.\nI can't \"fix\" something that I don't see.. Your command starts two processes attached to ConEmu \"conhost\": git.exe and sh.exe.\nConEmu is not able to realize if the processes are \"real\" or \"fake\".\nYou shall create an issue for Git and ask them do not leave these processes alive after creating new GUI window.\n\n. All ConEmu builds are available for download, you may check them.\nIt's absolutely illegal to monitor only root process. How do you think what would happen if the root process is a bootstrapper? In other words if root process does some initialization, runs the workload, and exists?. That is your opinion.\nConEmu is not a Far.\nI don't want to get bugs about unexpected killing application or even console start fails.\n\nHow do you think what would happen if the root process is a bootstrapper? In other words if root process does some initialization, runs the workload, and exists?. I would not implement bad options. Simple. I've already explained the reasons above.\n\nEven a Far uses \"forking\" technique when it autoupdates. With your suggested option the console will close unexpectedly instead of continue working.. > can you add such an option please?\nI've already answered the question.\n\nConEmu not closing the window as long as there is any background child process running is really very, very pesky.\n\nConEmu is safe terminal. You'll never lose your work unless you decide to press the close button. Suprise, but you may close ConEmu any time.\n\nConEmu terminates all the child processes, including those that are completely unrelated to the batch operation currently running.\n\n\nConEmu does not terminate anything by Ctrl+C.\nGUI applications are not attached into ConEmu console automatically, unless they do that themselves.\nCtrl+C is a feature of OS, sort of signals in Unix. It's absolutely on your applications what they do when signal is received. And of course, the signal comes only into applications attached to that console.\n.

That is an Microsoft conhost bug reported regularly on all Windows versions (few days ago it was Windows 7).\n\n@miniksa Is there a way to bypass the problem? Why input is dropped? How may ConEmu deal with conhost on legacy but still supported Windows versions like Win7?. How do you run Bash? Via task? What is there?.

I close this as old issue and not related to ConEmu (ConEmu just start process, Windows blocks that action).\nPerhaps it has something similar with gh-1602, than you may try to specify your distro guid.. As you said, hotkey marker is set. So the ConEmu work is done properly.\nBugs and issues about Windows Explorer features shall be reported to Microsoft. It's not in my competence.. OK, this Microsoft problem may be bypassed via some registry manipulations. But it's still MS problem - hotkey is displayed but not processed.. Purpose?. Background is set on per-console basis.

I do use ShareX for screenshots.\nNot sure about the same exact reason, but if ConEmu can't find Far borders, it can't drag them of course.\nAbout glitches...

KiTTY is ChildGui, it renders output internally\nThe issue is really weird because it is not reproduced in my environment at all. Perhaps it depens on some fish or ubuntu settings, I don't know.\nLogFiles are required.\n\n\nIn the folder C:\\Users\\TJYSunset\\Temp\\ConEmuPack.180309\\ run \nConEmu64.exe -loadcfgfile .\\ConEmu.xml\n\n\nChange the contents of the {Bash::bash} task to\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --log C:/Users/TJYSunset/Temp/ConEmuPack.180309/ --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt\n\n\nSave settings, exit ConEmu\n\n\nNow in the folder C:\\Users\\TJYSunset\\Temp\\ConEmuPack.180309\\ run\nConEmu64.exe -log -loadcfgfile .\\ConEmu.xml\n\n\nIf the \u23ce sign appears (as expected) than close ConEmu, zip all created *.log files (in your ConEmuPack.180309 folder) and post here link to your archive.\n.

Hm, results are expected.\nWaiting for log-files\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1402#issuecomment-373381915. I need screenshot with the problem and visible StatusBar with TermInfo column.. Don't know what happened on your side. Sadly. It may be or may be not ConEmu problem, and without reproduction we can't be sure.\nHowever nobody else joined the thread.. That is definitely Microsoft conhost bug.\nThe problem is that on CJK Windows versions conhost still behaves differently than on European versions.\nEspecially in that case, when fish outputs the \u23ce (U+23CE) conhost advances the cursor by two cells on CJK Windows 10 (I'm trying Chinese build 10.0.16299.15), but on European version the cursor is advanced by only one cell as expected!\nConhost fills two cells with single-width glyph! Yeah, it sets the COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE and COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE flags in these two cells, but terminal app (fish) expects that it output only one character and things are broken.\nFrom my tests, a lot of glyphs are treated improperly as double-cell characters on CJK windows (at least all Russian and Greek letters).\n/cc @miniksa. Actually, that happens even without ConEmu.\n\nPS. Going to create a workaround.. @Leoyzen What is your comment about?. \n. Did you install powershell manually? Why don't you use PowerShell Core 2.0?. Yes PS 6.0. Confused with .Net Core. PowerShell is not built with msys/cygwin. It's a Windows console application.\nWhen you run it from POSIX terminal (connector) its behavior is different compared with conhost or {cmd} task.\nI believe you'll get same results if you run your tests from mintty/git-bash.. I think, dragging the panels by the bottom in the center may change size of both panels. So left and right panels may be changed independently without modifiers.. ConEmu may trigger either macro or sequence of keys.\nMacro mode is resource consuming and therefore is not interactive.. https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html. You shall\n\nUse predefined Task to run WSL: https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#connector\nInform ConEmu about WSL working directory: https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html#connector-ps1. https://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html#Where_log_files_are_created.

Read this first: https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html. I don't understand your problem. Anything is configurable in ConEmu.. Expected behavior.

You may copy all console contents at once via menu.. I think it would more handy to start selection with mouse and expand selected area with hotkeys (e.g. Shift+PgDn or even Ctrl+Shift+End). You can start either rectangular or streaming selection. Obviously it depends on tge direction you drag mouse for selection start or arrow keys pressed.. Required sizes are 14px, 21px, 28px.. @aplocher I'm not a designer, are you?. The toolbar resizes icons because there were no properly rendered bitmaps. This will be changed of course.\nNope. Users (and me) receive notifications on new comments only.. Nope. It should work like a charm, there are no limits for Tasks count.\nCheck your XML, seems like you didn't fill the Count properly.. ConEmu doesn't control transmission of screen contents, it's an RDP bug or configuration problem.\nAlso you are using a year old ConEmu version.. You don't need hotkey to preview palettes. Moreover, the palette is not an option supported to be changed often - it's configured per ConEmu instance or selected Tasks.\nYou may easily preview palettes from Colors settings page, just place focus into palette name field and press Down key multiple times.. Why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\nThird-party application problems. You shall try the same steps but without ConEmu too make comparison reliable.. Seems like you don't use wsl connector?. https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartCmd.html\n. Why don't try usual -c switch?\n{bash} -c \"ssh root@<IP>\"\n. If ConEmu doesn't have focus, the shortcut activates the window. This is by design and previous requests.. The purpose of hotkey is to switch \"focused state\".\nIf ConEmu has focus - hide it, if it does not have focus - user shall be able to type commands immediately after hotkey is pressed.\n. \"Set focus to ConEmu\" is intended for ChildGui only.. What is the visibility? Should ConEmu get focus if it is covered by other windows? If it is covered by 95%? Or 95% of ConEmu is visible?. Do you have \"Restore to active monitor\" enabled?. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsDefTerm.html#id2660. try matlab -nodesktop -new_console\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html. That means MATLAB is too complicated to embed it automatically.\nIt is GUI application which starts GUI windows and (may be) one conhost window.\nYou have only one option - attach certain console manually after MATLAB startup.. 1. Description is not clear. Slow? What? Where?\n2. How do you start your console?\n3. Why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?\n\nThird-party application problems\nBad Issues. Unanswered\n\n\nHow do you start your console?. So you do not run bash/vim via cygwin/msys connector in ConEmu?\nOn the \"fast\" screenshot how do you started your console?. @tooyangtoonavie Why do you ignore my questions? Don't you really believe I can magically guess that you start git's bash with \"DOUBLE CLICK\"? Moreover, how can I guess what is the contents if the shortcut icon on your Desktop?\n\nI will surprise you.\n\nPress Win+R and run your C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe (don't you use DefTerm feature?). Run vim and observe the slowness.\nPress Win+R and run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {Git Bash}. Run vim and compare the speed.\n. Timer?. There is column \"Timer\". Did you mean \"CPU time\"?. These are absolutely different times.\nCPU time depicts actual consumed resources, it doesn't go if application waits for something.\nStart time - is fixed value.\nAlive time - counted from Start time.\n\nActually, there are other counters.. Are there problems if you run 180114 as ConEmu64.exe -basic -run powershell.exe -noprofile?\nAnd what about cmd: ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd.exe?\nWhen you notice whole system slowdown, what happens in the TaskManager or ProcessExplorer?. Just download 7z package and unpack it to some folder. ConEmu is fully portable.\nWhen you see the slowdown, look also at \"GDI objects\" and \"User objects\".\nI have opened ConEmu instance (no powershell however) for days and don't observe any slowdown.. Of course, when you see slowdown, check in TaskManager not only ConEmu processes, but all running processes in the system.. Same as gh-1428. Can you check build 180130 please?. Can you turn on LogFiles?. LogFiles\n-log switch or checkbox in settings.. It looks like a race condition which is not expected in Windows 10.. If you have title bar - you have buttons there.\nOtherwise user may choose if they want to see toolbar.\nI know many cases when ConEmu was used without TabBar, StatusBar and TitleBar. It's a user choice.. Try to remove clink from autorun. It has no sense in ConEmu.. Try to set https://conemu.github.io/version.ini as update source. I think either your provider or router or administrator blocks ConEmu downloader. Also this nay be a temporary problem. Nothing nay be changed from my side.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/UpdateModes.html#auto-curl-wget\n. I don't know. You have bad lines:\n12:06:22.499{3480} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Connecting to Server, family=13617, data=1.101.113.147\n12:06:22.552{3480} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Connected to Server, family=13617, data=1.101.113.147\n12:06:22.607{3480} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Closing Connection\n12:06:22.607{3480} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Connection Closed\nJust checked and correct lines are\n13:00:00.689{14812} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Connecting to Server, family=13617, data=1.101.85.147\n13:00:00.709{14812} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Connected to Server, family=13617, data=1.101.85.147\n13:00:00.848{11792} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Sending request\n13:00:00.848{11792} Info:  InetCallback for handle x00CC000C: Request sent (181 bytes)\nConEmu calls WinInet (Windows API) to acquire files and someone closes your connection.\nTry to compare with Internet Explorer.. You shall try in IE 8 github.io sites which certificates were issued to github.com, e.g. https://minwook-shin.github.io/ or https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/new-project.html and so on.\n. As I supposed.\nI can't check IE 8 (don't have this version) but IE 11 works with all these sites. AFAIK IE 11 uses wininet.dll, so the problem may be either with you internet settings (look in Control Panel) or absent updates of certificate roots.. I don't think I will help, but try it and let us know.\nGoogle:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=internet+explorer+unable+to+open+https+pages. This request actually gets in the conflict with #1397.\nAppDistinct option supposes the change in the active console only.. Only GDI functions are supported in current version.. Well, can you run ConEmu64.exe -log, reproduce the problem and upload LogFiles? . @lowtrucks So what about your TaskBar? Do you have it at all? Seems like it is not set to auto hide, but I don't see it on screenshots.. You've reported this on wrong place.\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/\nWhen you start \"ConEmu here\" from Explorer, ConEmu doesn't force starting shell to change the working directory to certain folder, instead ConEmu process changes its own working directory to E:\\... (there is no /mnt of course) and starting shell inherits this working folder.\nSo you shall ask Microsoft engineers how to eliminate /mnt from working folder. Tat is the only correct solution IMHO.\nAlternatively you may try to force your shell to certain folder by shell startup command or even write a script in your ~/.profile stripping /mnt and do cd.\n. 1. Try latest ConEmu build, no cmder. Download build 180131 or later and run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}.\n2. Clink has known problems and you shall not use it in tests.\n3. Run ssh without ConEmu to compare.. 180503 is obsolete, update! Old Builds\n\nThen the error occurs.\n\nThe text?\n\nRunning less or vim on the remove Linux host through ssh behaves exactly the same way as described in the previous bullet. Only this time it is the ssh.exe, that gets the fatal error.\n\nUnclear. Do you run ssh once and in that ssh instance error occurs when you run less on remote??. Anyway\n\n\nYou shall NOT run cygwin or msys applications directly:\n\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html#add-default-tasks\n\n\nI believe this may be easily reproduced without ConEmu, so report it to cygwin devs. Most likely they fail to process backscroll buffer Windows conhost legally provides.\n\n\nThird-party application problems. Yep, simple googling for the error give a link:\nhttps://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2015-08/msg00353.html\n\n\nAnd the answer:\n\nSo why not run under mintty, then?  Cygwin runs better under mintty in general.\n\nSame as me: Use connector to bypass cygwin bugs.. That is not true. Cmd without ConEmu does autocompletion on pasting texts with tabs.. Also, your issue description is not fair.\nI strongly doubt that you have $ in your cmd prompt.. I just say that issue is not related to ConEmu. 1. In WinAPI there is no way to tell console app \"hey, I'm going to paste\"\n2. In posix environment (BashOnWindows in ConEmu, cygwin/msys connector) ConEmu uses ANSI prefix and suffix on paste. And program (e.g. zsh) knows that paste is in progress.\n@miniksa is it true, and we still don't have API function to \"paste\" arbitrary string properly? . That is not a valid way. I prefer to avoid undocumented functions use.\nconhost has its own secret WM for paste AFAIR. The issue may be closed either by topic-starter or by project owner.. Look in the StatusBar for \"Terminal Modes\".\nIf Docker asks for xterm emulation and keyboard support, ConEmu fulfils its request. If application in the Docker container doesn't know how to process xterm keyboard events, it's a Docker problem but not a ConEmu bug.. Does bash task contains conemu-cyg-64? Jyst to be sure.. How to reproduce?. Or I need ANSI LogFiles\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiLogFiles.html. You don't need to \"install\" wslbridge. It's included in ConEmu distro and all you need - proper default Task created for you by ConEmu.\n. Issue has been already fixed, just wait for a while, new build is on the way. What about build 190217?. @L00SED No status bar. What version are you running?. To understand what happens please turn on LogFiles and make screenshots before and after the problem appears (I need timestamps to search in log).. I can't reproduce your issue.\nCode snipped is correct.. Do you have TaskBar autohidden?. A lot of builds passed. Is it really actual yet?. If you said \"fullscreen recording\" than where is the Taskbar?. If TaskBar is autohidden, ConEmu (as any other maximized application) have to leave few pixels user may use to activate TaskBar.. For screenshot from https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1445#issuecomment-385240323 I want to see LogFiles please.. I need LogFiles and step-by-step full-screen screenshots in current ConEmu build.. I don't think they are related, 1445 has gap not on TaskBar side.. It works properly on my Win 10 (1709), VS 2017 (15.5.x) and ConEmu 180318.\nNot enough info to go further. At least I need exact message text and Log Files.. * What project type do you try to debug? C#, C++, Desktop, UWP?\n* What platform and config? Mixed/x86/x64/release/debug?\n. @jValdron Log file devenv.exe-26500.log was created during Debug attempt or \"run without debug\"?. Sample project or at least exact project/debug options would help. Unfortunately I had not enough time to dig it. Anyway, I forked your repo.... ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {git bash}. ConEmu distro doesn't provide any msys2 dlls. If was your decision to place it there. Remove it.. Also, conemu-msys2-64 doesn't use cygwin1.dll! It's msys2 binary and the name depicts that.. It's the question for @git-for-windows what happened in latest msys updates which leads to impossibility to run bash in the interactive mode.. Definitely. It's a Git-for-Windows problem. For example, if you change your Task by adding -t xterm bash stops exiting on start.\nset \"PATH=%ProgramFiles%\\Git\\usr\\bin;%PATH%\" & \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe -t xterm /usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i -new_console:p\n. Git-for-windows is a bundle of MSYS, git and things.\nIt's definitely a problem of git-for-windows, especially because it doesn't work even without ConEmu (git-bash.exe fails too).\nJFI, the bug is already fixed in latest git-for-windows.. You didn't fill the shell field in the issue. Shall I guess?\n\nBad Issues\nChildGui. The Ctrl-Tab hotkey is non-configurable because it has too tight integration with dozen of tab switching options.\n\nYou may use GuiMacro as @m0n recommended.. It's user choice of course, but almost all Fxx keys are used by certain console applications themselves.. Have you tried to read docs?\nShell working directory. Current build is 180206, have you tried it?. Current build is 180206, have you tried it?. Did you see the commit?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/blog/2018/03/18/Build-180318.html. What about current ConEmu build?. Is this issue actual (build 190301)?. But ConEmu resizes panels internally. What is the purpose of these macros? I doubt the behavior may be changed.. Copy/Paste in terminal differs from any other application. In general you can't put text cursor in arbitrary place to paste there, the application (not terminal) decides where cursor may be located and where user may type text.\nPersonally I see mo sense in copy/paste menu - much more handy way is keyboard hotkey or RClick to do the action. RClick intelligent mode is unique in ConEmu which is answer to inability to do things properly in other terminals.\nAs far as I can remember, \"Stream\" selection was renamed to \"Text\" selection intentionally.. Do you really select files/folders from Far Manager panels? I can't imagine the purpose.. > No, I mean \"selecting text\" in the \"user area\" (command-line part of FAR).\nI do that daily. Just hide panels, Intelligent mode is enabled for you.. Close the issue?. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsKeyboard.html#id2526. @dima-ringba Far is Windows console application utilizing WinAPI. Just don't turn on xterm in Far consoles!!. @JonathanHolvey To get full featured terminal for bash you should use connector.\ncygwin/msys connector\nRecreate default tasks.. So you only have problems with Ctrl+BS?\nThis is general and well known Unix pty issue. Just google for keymappings for your inputrc.\nYou may check what ConEmu sends by showkeys -a.. Don't assume, but check\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/KeyEvents.html#key-reader. Not KeyEvents, but key-reader as my link says.\nThere are precompiled binaries on GitHub\nWith KeyEvents you may see, that there were no differences between versions.. Sample output\n$ ./kr-cyg32.exe\nStarting raw conin reader, press Ctrl+C to stop\n<x1F><x7F>\n<x1F> was Ctrl+BS, and <x7F> just BS.. And mintty. ConEmu bahavior is the same.\n\n. > In ConEmu 161206 and 180506 I get  for both Backspace and Ctrl+Backspace\nWithout connector?\nArrows (at least) are working properly for me and many others. So\n\nrun ConEmu64.exe -basic -detached and run predefined task for Msys2, check arrows (in bash prompt or where?)\nrun mintty from your Msys2 installation and compare results of key-reader\ntell us what Msys2 version do you use. Did you see this: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsConfirm.html#id1546\n. Show your hotkey settings.\nWhat hotkey do you try when \"Create new console\" dialog appears?. You have set hotkeys for actions with Create confirmation as description states.\n\nYou may create GuiMacro to do that without confirmation. Or replace Win+W hotkey.. Strange, recreate(2,0) should not show confirmation. Commit 1ae29ff6e will fix the problem. Please read docs. ConEmu does not merge anything, all environment are inherited from the caller.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/WindowsEnvironment.html. > I do not know enough about the explorer integration, but something is off here.\nIt depends on the caller process. Restart it or report the problem to Microsoft.. How do you run your shell? Do you use Connector?. When you run less from cmd - all problems should be addressed to cygwin/msys. They use WinAPI instead of ANSI and ConEmu is out of play.\nTasks were implemented to hide complicated command lines, so users may run them by names.. Why do you say \"hang\"? The shell just don't respond to input? Why do yo think it's not a Third-party issue?\nTo debug\n\nUse latest alpha build\nOpen Real Console and try to type there\nLook at process tree at ProcessExplorer when the problem occurs.\n. Just install ConEmu and run ConEmu.\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html. Yep, you are using cmder )\nIt overwrites prompt via clink and this may break things.\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html (I prefer to see directory in the tab title)\n. 1. Your cropped screenshot https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1472#issuecomment-383367714 is definitely the cmder.\n180206 is OldBuild.. https://conemu.github.io/#Disclaimer\n\nIt's not a terminal responsibility. There are several official download mirrors:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Downloads.html\nAutoupdate is working now.. I believe the issue is inside Docker.\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. Waiting for details: Versions, Screenshots etc.. > Again, it doesn't happen when I use plain CMD outside ConEmu.\n\nI don't see screenshots with ConEmu and plain CMD.\nI still think it's a third-party problem, but you are using very old stable build. Update to Preview at least.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. Windows Control Panel.\nWhen you disable theming (no caption and custom frame width) system colors are used.. Bad Issues. Old Builds. What do you mean by \"changing the conemu window from on screen to another\". * Screen?\n https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\n https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. > Roll it, change the screen under the mouse, unroll it.\nWhat is the \"screen\"?\n\nIt is not an old build issue.\n\nAnd what build are you trying? In your description it definitely OldBuild.\nAnyway, I can't understand your problem from the description. It's completely obscure.... 1. Windows has build numbers too.\n2. Why do you talk about ssh? Have you tried it with simple cmd?\n    ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd\n\n. One more interesting thing: the mentioned ghost console contains definitely different text. I do not see exactly because screen record is cropped.. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. There is no flashing with pwsh.\n\nDownloaded https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.0.2/PowerShell-6.0.2-win-x64.zip\nStarted as conemu64 -basic -run C:\\Tools\\PowerShell-6.0.2-win-x64\\pwsh.exe -nop\nConEmu window is resized without problems\n. When you change manually the macro You shall write it properly.\nBut you changed and saved wrong version of the Macro! Use Lua version instead!. There is drop down list box. Check it.\nThere are different Far Manager versions.\n\n\n. Only one question. Why do you use Old Build?. Next question\n\nStart cygwin bash console\n\nHow exactly do you start bash?\n. For reading\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html. Is there mintty in your screenshots?\nI suppose you have different TERM variable set in terminal. This may cause your background color. Check the same in mintty.\nTo go further I need ANSI LogFiles:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html#Log_console_output\nReproduce background problem and name screenshot at that moment.. You may see in the log the following line\n\u001b[m\u001b[97m\u001b[48;5;242m\u001b[H\u001b[2J\u001b[22;1H\"/etc/adduser.conf\"\nThe \\e[48;5;242m means gray color in the xterm palette. So what is the question?\nYou have requested background color for you vim color scheme.\nhttps://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/. I think the behavior of this menu item shall replicate the same item from [+] toolbar button.. Related: gh-701\nI decided to rename all items to \"New console dialog...\" so they will work equally regardless confirmation setting. The main idea of Inside mode is that ConEmu just fit available area. Inside windows can't be resized from \"ConEmu side\".\nIf you want to use the feature, user have to ensure there is enough space for Inside window.\nSo, show the pane before calling Inside mode.. Please use search before posting.\ngh-1368. I didn't catch what do you suggest.\nConEmu works on top of conhost.\nThat means if you run ConEmu in Windows 10 you get flex-wrap from the box automatically.\n. Definitely, I need to check Detours and compare them with Minhook. If there will no speed drawbacks, I may use this package.. Old Builds. The request would make sense for different macro.\nYour case is already implemented.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html\n\n. You are correct, the feature has glitches.. * Third-party application problems\n* https://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html. \n. And there is more.com process on your screenshot, which obviously is not powershell.. I think it's possible to set the folder for AnsiLog files with -new_console argument.\nFor example: -new_console:L:\"C:\\Logs\".. Of course, they did not. That's why this issue has enhancement label.. gh-227\nIt's in RoadMap. I don't want to limit backscroll buffer just because of colors.. Your variation does not conform standard Windows palette. For example color-8 is expected to be BoldBlack.\n\n. %s means the title of the console, which you set from bash profile.\nBut best practice is described here: Shell working directory.. Default task or Startup task?\nGenerally speaking, you know the default task name, don't you?. Don't use -run switch at all. What's the problem?. The message is correct. Don't use -cur_console.. How and where did you configure it?. That is not expected. Create new admin task for your admin menu. You may even reuse your startup task in admin task.. If you have the task {Far Manager } you may create the task {Far Admin } containing\n{Far Manager } -new_console:a\nAnd run admin task from menu. 1. AppDistinct\n2. -new_console. Just start another ConEmu instance with task containing 2 PowerShell consoles.\nYou may even do that from first task in background console.. {First task}\n```\n\n{Far}\n{Far}\n{Far}\n-cur_console:n cmd /c start ConEmu64 -run {Second task}\n```\n. I said \"two tasks\"!\n\nAll powershell-s go to second task!. Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/q/49620861/1405560. Really? A year old build?. * https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html\n* https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. What exact \"latest\" version have you checked?. I need Log Files and ANSI output with repro. Please run from ConEmu prompt ConEmuC -CheckUnicode and push screenshot here. I'm interested in output from latest 180318 build. Please download fresh build 180408 and show output of ConEmuC -CheckUnicode again.. I wonder, are there any changes with this patch?. Updated link:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ldvfttrst3acxkw/ConEmuCD.gh1501.b.7z?dl=0. I think ConEmu issue tracker is wrong place to ask.\nConEmu hides cursor when console application asks for it. Check your bash profile.\nTo ensure, you may turn on ANSI logging and check for  cursor modification sequences.\n. The file please.\nComparison with 161206 is not fair, there were no connector, and ConEmu didn't received any ANSI.. You may try to change TERM to xterm via connector arguments. You may disable autosave if you don't use \"Auto save/restore open tabs\" and \"Auto save window size/pos on exit\" is off.. Of course, there is no way to save on one configuration several same name values. How do you think ConEmu may distinguish them?\nYou may use either named configurations or different xml files.. It can. But you didn't invent the way how windows would reload them on start! Don't you run them all from the same shortcut?. It's impossible due to ConEmu architecture. Tell the problem to font authors?\nConEmu uses WinAPI to extract font properties, there is absolutely no magic about it.. JFI\nTab labels aren't painted by ConEmu and I don't know what is going during that. Perhaps spacing is ignored tgere.\nWhen ConEmu outputs something to VirtualConsole the glyph width from Font properties is utilized, I suppose spacing is taken into account.. Please ask extension maintainer. It's not my project.. ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}\nRun this from Win+R. > In the debug tool I see an unexpected command CD: \"C:\"\nThat is not unexpected and not a command. It's a working directory for command to be executed.\nAnyway, seems there are some problems with executing simple command\ncmd /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\"\nTo be sure\n\nRun ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd.exe and try to execute from the prompt (in ConEmu)\n\ncmd /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\"\n\n\nIf previous test passed, try to comment this line in CmdInit.cmd. I suppose the ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd} will start properly.\n\n\nIf so, uncomment line with find and attach here the log from Settings/Debug/Exec (I need .csv file, use Save as button).. Ref: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/623#issuecomment-340801295. Hm... Next tests than\n\n\nRun cmd.exe outside from ConEmu. Try to execute from the prompt cmd /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\". What happens?\n\nRun ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd.exe -cur_console:c1, open Debug page and try to execute cmd /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\". Window shall retain. I'm interested in csv logs.\nTo be shure, do you have %windir%\\system32\\find.exe file? Is it native Microsoft executable?\n\n. > any exe from this directory, such as ping, ipconfig, etc, has the same behavior.\nWhat behavior? Crash? Pipelined or not? More details please.. Just to summarize (for search and for history):\nThe following command fails in weird way when executed from cmd prompt started in ConEmu\ncmd /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\"\n\nTwo error lines appear\n\nthe process tried to write to a nonexistent pipe\n\n\nOriginal shell unexpectedly exits with exit code = 0.\n. So, I have two questions\n\n\nDetails about \"ping, ipconfig, etc, has the same behavior\"\n\nMay be the following command starts properly?\n\n\"%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\"\n. Nope. All tests were done with -basic switch, that means same settings in any machine.\nAs I mentioned before, there was similar report for Windows 7. Very few users observe the problem.... @n-dobryukha Without your help the issue can't be resolved.. Let's try ProcessMonitor first.\n\nStart cmd console in ConEmu: ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd.exe /D\nStart events logging in ProcessMonitor\nExecute ping in cmd prompt (immediate closing of the window is expected).

For example, you can press ENTER to introduce blank lines between the lines coming from the process.\n\nNope. When you press Enter the key is processed by the console application. Even on Linux things go that way. Any other behavior will totally break application output.\nJFI, if you run the following from ConEmu WSL prompt\nfor i in `seq 1 100000`; do echo $i; sleep 2; done\nYou may use Enter to insert blank lines. Guess why?\n\nGo to settings, there are a lot of neats )\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTabBar.html#id2599. You can clear the console at any time.\nSo, what's the question?. Open hotkeys list and search for reset or terminal.\nAs always, docs are very useful too\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html. Ref gh-751, gh-1420. Contents of your bash task? Connector?. Try to open some file in emacs directly. I just have checked and saw no problem.... It somewhat related to https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/1668. Test files for history:\nhttps://gist.github.com/Maximus5/ef2cae5e0dd546a9f01bb023d216a540. Perpaps in future, there (in separate xml) will be located cmd prompt history too.. I have no idea. It's a question for bash authors I think. Docker process all ConIn and ConOut internally. It is not build for msys or cygwin, but it runs from bash. That is strange. Anyway, docker issues shall be addressed to its authors. The \"input stream\" error will appear in mintty too.\nAs for Git Bash, its distribution somehow differs from official msys. You may ask git-bash maintainer what's going wrong.. How do you run \"Ubuntu shell on WSL with zsh\"?. That is wrong way to run BashOnWindows in ConEmu.. BashOnWindows in ConEmu. Old Builds. How exactly do you run your cygwin console?\nDo you know about console codepages?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/UnicodeSupport.html. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. TLDR - don't do that.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nRun e:\\PortableApps\\Cygwin\\Cygwin.bat outside of ConEmu and observe the same bugs. And the bug should be addressed to cygwin, isn't it?\n\nIf i use the Cygwin console standalone\n\nIf you use recommended Task you will not have this problem.. Did you read my comment? Did you check what I suggest?\n\nRun e:\\PortableApps\\Cygwin\\Cygwin.bat outside of ConEmu . Use default task {Cygwin bash} as I said above.\nThis way allows to bypass cygwin bugs.. Is there any reason to report problems on the build released half a year ago?\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n. I've checked it and do not see the problem - \"ConEmu here\" starts shell in the folder from Explorer.\nShow screenshots of tge task, integration, and started shell from Explorer.. Just use -dir C:\\Development in the Task parameters.\n-new_console:d:... has higher priority.. I don't understand.\nWhat task did you configure?\nWhat context menu item did you register?\nWhere do you call it and what happens?. Update to tge latest 180429 by the way. So, they do work both? Both 1 and 2 open proper folder.. Did you try {cmd} task?. You didn't understand purpose of the title switch in ConEmu.\nIt set fixed title in the ConEmu window and of course it will not reflect console title anymore.. You may create a request for new feature. I have in mind templates support for window title (like Tab templates work now).. ok. But it is safe.. In most cases you use paste to execute some commands in the prompt. So, by Ctrl+V you get the command pasted and it's ready to be executed by explicit Enter.. BTW, Shift+Ins does multiline paste by default. You've asked about default Ctrl+V behavior (options for the fresh installation). So I didn't mention any option.. Please don't post questions already answered here many times\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\nTLDR; Use default bash task. 1. ConEmu doesn't change tasks without explicit request. This is by design.\n2. WSL can't work properly without connector. This is due Microsoft WinAPI limitations.. But why? Icons are apparent way to distinct tabs.. You may disable Tab Icons via TabIcons option in settings.. https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html. Isn't it a question for cmder?\nIn ConEmu you have different icons for different shells by default.. I mean (my way) you may define tasks for your tabs with specific initial path, environment and of course the icon.\nThat doesn't mean I stop improving TabBar, just a note about current abilities.. Shell working directory. Your description is rather abstract. What shell are you trying? What exact steps have you made to configure it?. Just rechecked and Duplicate starts new cmd shell in proper folder.. And how do you run these shells?\nAs you said, it works with cmd, that means if ConEmu able to know shell CD, things work.\nSo, it is either your shell doesn't report CD to ConEmu (easy to check with tab templates or even via \"Restart...\" dialog),\nOr your shell changes the directory to certain fixed folder after start.\nNeither of these is related to ConEmu, just config of your shell.. What's wrong with you? Do you really think the rudeness helps???. Do you have problems with reading comprehension?\nI've asked you\n\neasy to check with tab templates or even via \"Restart...\" dialog\n. I don't see any bug in your description.. ConEmu -basic -run cmd\n\nScroll bar appears automatically, as expected. Does not matter if \"Dynamic range\" is on or off.\n\nNo bug, closed.. When dynamic is on, there is nothing to scroll and scrollbar does not appear on mouse over.. And on your last screenshot you haven't moved mouse cursor at all.. Scroll bar is brought by timeout from settings. So, if you command stops scrolling fast - there is no reason to reveal the scrollbar.. Report the problem to fix the bug. Easy.. 1. ConEmu never generates *.zip files.\n2. On exceptions or crashes ConEmu saves CrashDump into Desktop/ConEmuTrap folder and asks user to zip it and report to developers.\n. That behavior is intended and optional.\nSay thanks to the gh-1420. 1. https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n2. https://conemu.github.io/en/VersionComparison.html#x64-or-x86. https://conemu.github.io/#Disclaimer. The Move splitter upward does not do split, it does just as it say - moves the splitter between splits.\nAnd there is no \"crash\" on my side.\nI don't believe... Why do you think that \"it just quits\"? . Have you checked process list?. Please attach any debugger to ConEmu GUI (for example, ConEmuC64.exe /DEBUGPID=<ConEmuGuiPID>) and try to reproduce. Is there exception or crash?. Does it suggest to create a dump?. So, what is your compains/suggestions? (1) and (2)?\n\nThe display position is very good, suspended in the upper half of the screen is very conducive to viewing and beautiful\n\nPosition of ConEmu window is configured by user and stored in settings.\n\nIt is very quick to open and close, just press the shortcut key F1, you can also set the focus to automatically hide the loss\n\nConEmu may be opened by hotkey.\n. 1. Build 161206 is two years old stable. Actual is 180503. It's unfair to compare old builds.\n2. When you run ConEmu first time you see rather simple dialog to turn on your hotkey and Quake style. There is even the interface language option now.\n3. You mentioned F1 key many times. But don't you know that this key is usually assigned to open Help for almost any Windows application? Well, it's a user choise but this decision is not user-friendly for Windows users.\n\nAfter all. Do you suggest to implement default keyboard schemes? Seems like you mentioned only F1 key and I've already answered about it.\nWhat is your native language by the way?. l10n like this? It's all in your hands.\n\n. Nope. Selection is working on your config.\n\n. I don't know what are you doing. The selection just works.\nAnd if course properties of RealConsole have no effect on selection in ConEmu.. Show your animation. 1. Run ConEmu64.exe -basic -log -run cmd.  Does section works?\n2. Run ConEmu64.exe -log -run cmd /D. She question.\nUpload LogFiles on problems.\n@dakotahawkins there is blinking on your screenshot, may this depict up/down/up/down mouse events?. It was fixed in 180429, kudos to @dakotahawkins . I don't see version and console info on the screenshot. Thanks for diagnostics\n00105e6. My commit is almost the same, but it does not change comments on other lines. I prefer clean commits which are easy to understand. Yours commit changes different if branches instead of removing bad one.\nAnyway, I really appreciate your efforts in troubleshooting!. It's not clear.\nIf you select text in prompt, what is the sense to paste that selected text in place?. Both -cur_console:pm:/cur_console:pm:/mnt and -cur_console:pm:/cur_console:pm:/ are illegal.\nYou pass p and m switches twice.\nAnd both help page -new_console and About/-new_console show you proper syntax: m:\"\"\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html#syntax\nm:/ is illegal too, don't you want to get //c/path instead of /c/path?\n. I see now.\nYou talked about m switch, but it is intended only for conversion of paths on paste.\nBut your issue is about wslbridge in fact, nit ConEmu.\nActually, it's a question to @rprichard - how to run wslbridge properly in your case.. Try these binaries\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/i8z8gm80wfrcr91/wslbridge-wslpath.7z?dl=0. > It works great now while using /cur_console:pm:/mnt. But should I still switch that to \"\"?\nAs I said, this options is used for pasting paths only. Your choice.\n\nAccessing /mnt/e is an empty folder. Not sure if this is expected.\n\nAsk this in Microsoft/WSL tracker. May be that is a WSL bug.\n. You may use any option\n\n-dir E:\\ in the Task parameters\n-new_console:d:\"E:\\\" in Task commands\nor special wslbridge switch -C/e/. From my observations it's only one pixel left to reveal taskbar.. Please show your monitor information from About/SysInfo. One pixel. The same experience from MSPaint and ConEmu\n\n\n\n. And when you run ConEmu with standard styles (frame and caption) Windows maintain its position internally.\n\n. More tests here: https://github.com/Maximus5/ms-bug-8\nActually, for all standard windows autohidden TaskBar obscures two pixels of client area.. https://conemu.github.io/en/PowershellPrompt.html. From your video I think it does not relate to \"double click\".\nThere is an option Change prompt (cmd, powershell) text cursor position with Left Click\ue9cb.\nBut! ConEmu does not change text cursor position when you click above the prompt.\n\nTry to compare with ConEmu64.exe -basic -run powershell -noprofile.\n. gh-1454. gh-346. BTW, you are talking about menu in the gh-1541 ;). I don't know any application that behaves such way.\nIt's expected UX to size contents but not the window itself.\nMoreover, when you increase font size increasing window will reach limits very soon.\nSo, no. This would not be good behavior.. Terminal is just an application which should follow common UI expectations.\nBut you may turn on \"Auto size\" on the Fonts settings page and resize the window maintaining its size in cells.. https://conemu.github.io/en/CpuIoConsumption.html. It is set by default.\n\n. I've said many many times. Don't run bash.exe or wsl.exe directly.\nUse predefined {bash} task instead.\nWhat shall I do to make this clear?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html. > Btw. only happens within ConEmu other terminals are fine.\nI don't believe in that. What terminals?\nConhost? It is not a \"terminal\" at all. It is Windows Kernel. Of course it has privileges.\nwsltty? It uses wslbridge. And you don't use wslbridge in ConEmu. Is the comparison fair?\n. > Well, up until 1803 there was no problem with it. All I/O worked just fine.\nIt is not true. As mentioned in gh-1314 there were problem with IO, there were dropped or even defective characters on paste. The issue was repored on bare wsl/bash without connector too. And it was closed coz the only workaround is using connector.\n. Anyway, I found what was changed in Win10 and fix is coming.. @mloskot Why do you ask in this issue? It's about paste only.\nDistros were discussed and explained here: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1309#issuecomment-391029398. Release notes say \"Default task\".\nBut I doubt you install new clean configuration. What is your bash task contents?. All questions should be addressed to wslbridge (@rprichard) - it does not support -c switch. Use -t instead.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#connector\n. BTW, if you want colorized ls output\n{bash} -t bash -i -c \"ls /bin\"\n. Nope. Order is preserved.\n\nShow screenshot of ConEmu before close\nShow your xml file after ConEmu close\nShow screenshot of ConEmu/Startup settings page after ConEmu start\n. And 180206  is definitely Old Build. At last do you really close ConEmu window instead of minimisation/hide?. Just create aggregate task to run them.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html. Don't you use cmder again?. * install ConEmu into separate folder from https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/download/v18.05.06/ConEmuPack.180506.7z\nRun ConEmu as ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd.exe /D.\nCheck your prompt.\n\nThe issue was not created by template, I don't see versions, shell/task you are running, etc.. What is your result about? I've asked you to check your issue (prompt) I  newly installed ConEmu.. \nThere were only quotations. Github requires empty line after >-quoted lines.\nI don't understand your problem.\nDo you know about tab templates?\nDo you know that you may change console title with ANSI?. What title? Window? Tab?\nTab templates: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTabBar.html#id2106\nWhen you run cmd.exe /D neither batch file is loaded. You have to change prompt by prompt ... command manually. And that was what I meant by \"Check your prompt\".. The question was: window or tab? And you already have folder in window title.\nAnyway, please read docs. It's all there.\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CmdPrompt.html\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html\n. I've already answered you.\n\n\nYou may change title of the console window via ANSI sequences. But some shells set title themselves.\n\nPreferred and working way is tab title via tab templates in settings dialog.\nThe issue about window title template already exists.\n\nI don't know how to explain that better. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1521. Just to be sure - does it reproduce if you run ConEmu as\nConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}?\nWhat is output of the command ConEmuC -CheckUnicode?. ConEmu uses some AI to disable confirmation before 10sec. That's why I asked for details.. 180206 is definitely old build. Actual is 180506.\nContent of the task matters.. This feature is intended ONLY for DefTerm as page name says. Please add after conemu-msys2-64.exe logging switch --log c:/temp (or some othe folder).\nRun the task, reproduce the problem recording gif and upload here link to logfile (gist?) and new gif.. I can reproduce the gh-1259. Interesting page (your link) but you misunderstood its meaning: it describes what user application may write to stdoutput.\nBut you need description for stdinput encoding, it's different.\nConEmu implements xtrem keyboard sequences.. Sort of: http://www.xfree86.org/4.5.0/ctlseqs.html#PC-Style%20Function%20Keys\nLet me know if you may find better page. Sort of: http://www.xfree86.org/4.5.0/ctlseqs.html#PC-Style%20Function%20Keys\nLet me know if you may find better page. Just click [+] button.. Do you mean \"two finger scroll touchpad\"?. Please run ConEmu64.exe -basic -log, execute some command with long output (e.g. dir /s c:\\Windows\\system32) and try to scroll with touchpad.\nIf problem persists upload LogFiles to gist and put link here.\nHowever ConEmu has scrollbar and you may use it for convenience.. Yes, I need logs.. I have a question.\nWhat is the (expected) behavior of that mouse wheel?\nIn general, when user does one \"click\" of the wheel, they have an option to select how many lines of the contents to scroll. It's 3 lines per wheel click I think.\nHow about your device?. I made a commit and it's interesting to compare it with iTerm2 (new build will be released soon). I think it's not so smooth as iTerm2 but 180626 is expected to work properly with your touchpad ;). You started normal ConEmu console, but change it behavior after that.\nI suppose both instances have different AppID - About/SysInfo.. Check AppID. Did you save settings after activating quake mode?\nWhat are the properties of pinned shortcut?\n. > If not in quake mode and is hidden by Ctrl-`, then TaskBar pinned button launches a new window\nYou saved settings for Quake mode, don't you?\nSo, why do you talk about \"not in quake mode\"?\n. I'm totally lost.\nWhat are you doing, why, and what is the problem?\nWhen you change Q mode pinned shortcut is not obliged to restore application in different mode. . * Close (terminate) all ConEmu instances\n Change properties of the TaskBar pinned item - add -log switch\n Reproduce. 1. You are using very old deprecated stable build of ConEmu.\n2. Reflow of console contents is done by Windows, not ConEmu. So this issue should be addressed to Microsoft.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. ConEmu does not render anything, it's Windows API.\nAnyway, this feature request already exists: gh-788.. 1. Old Builds\n2. BashOnWindows in ConEmu. Dup: gh-1309. That is because your mikrotik output contains code \\e[1;9999r. This locks scrolling in that region and all output goes above the screen.\nI don't know where this value (9999) comes from, but it's incorrect, because your ConEmu backscroll buffer is much larger.\n. I have no idea why 9999 number appears. Try to limit backscroll buffer in ConEmu?\nRun your task with switch -cur_console:h1000,  any changes? Attach log file.... Thanks, I'll add this to docs.. https://conemu.github.io/en/InternetIssues.html. Issues in \"Ready for Testing\" shall be either closed or moved back to backlog on problems. The answer was from @jpwilksch ;)\nI consider to do following changes\n\nreplace > with $ and $ with #\nsupport some flags from environment, e.g. set ConEmuPromptNL=NO or set ConEmuPromptNames=NO . Isn't it fixed already? Perhaps you left -lng switch in the command line?. Vendor folder means cmder, not a ConEmu installation.\n\nThe problem was fixed three month ago in ConEmu.. Old Builds. Sorry, I completely forgot that there were no new builds after commit with bugfix.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/blog/2019/01/08/Build-190108.html. So, redefine them?. I suppose that your keyboard just doesn't send proper keystrokes.\nYou may check that by starting KeyEvents outside of ConEmu.\nRun it, press Apps+R and show the results. Your keyboard doesn't send proper events as I supposed.\nUnless you have some settings in your BIOS ConEmu can't fight with hardware.. Why do you report cygwin/bash problem here?. > In addition, the cygwin terminal does not have this issue\nReally? Press Win+R and type c:\\cygwin\\bin\\bash.exe -l -i. Type commands and shutdown. History is saved, isn't it?. Sorry, I have not noticed that you are using cygwin default task.. https://conemu.github.io/en/MicrosoftBugs.html#ctrl-c is related to native Windows console applications.. Have you tried to update ConEmu?. Third-party application problems. 1. conemu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}\n2. title abc\n3. working. I do not suggest anything yet because lack of facts )\nIt's improper on startup because it's expected the title of started cmd console is cmd, not ConEmu.\nTry to run the following\nconemu64.exe -basic -visible -run {cmd}\nand you'll get RealConsole visible on start.\nCompare conhost (RealConsole) window title with Tab label after startup and after several title bla-bla-bla different commands.\n. And without -visible it airways fails?. @miniksa It looks like a regression in the insider build. I can't check this personally (failed to update Windows to latest), but from description it looks like conhost doesn't change RealConsole title if console was started hidden, as ConEmu always does.. Almost. It should be\nconst wchar_t* posixSpec = bAutoQuote ? L\"$!\" : L\" ()$!\";\n\n. Reading about quoting: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/quoting\nConsider following changes:\n\nDupCygwinPath would be called with bAutoQuote=true on Paste; it would be still possible to paste with bAutoQuote=false via GuiMacro\nUse strong quoting (single-quote) where only ' have to be weirdly-quoted: 'Here'\\''s my test...'. https://conemu.github.io/en/Xterm256Colors.html\n\nMerged: gh-227. Long RClick does work.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFarPlugin.html. * And get this file: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/download/v18.05.06/ConEmuPack.180506.7z\n And this: https://farmanager.com/files/Far30b5200.x64.20180502.7z\n Unpack both in the folder, e.g. C:\\Test1582\n* And run C:\\Test1582\\ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {far}\n\n. Final test, run this\nC:\\Test1582\\ConEmu64.exe -basic -log -run {far}\nand show ConEmu-gui-*.log. RightClick ignored of NOT isFilePanel\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html#Screenshot. Screenshot of Settings/Info?. Strange situation.\nMay you share your Far profile?. You may export profile to xml and review its contents for sensitive data: far /export profile (as I remember, please check in Far help).\nAlternatively, you may try Far with clean profile on your PC.. WSL: ConEmuC started under WSL can't find appropriate GUI window. I may check that and this probably may be fixed.\nPowershell: Notepad is started under Admin credentials. Expected behavior, I don't see the problem.. https://conemu.github.io/en/csudo.html. Nope. When you run ChildGui with -new_console switch you tell ConEmu to run this ChildGui inside ConEmu.\nBy design.. Via cmd start notepad.exe. It is not possible to run graphical ntvdm applications in ConEmu. By design.\nOnly console ones are supported like Norton commander, Dos navigator or Turbo Pascal.\nWant graphics? Use Dosbox or run them outside of ConEmu.. Doing what? Impossible things? Of course not.\nDosbox integration exists already, ntvdm support is limited by design.. JFI. ntvdm hangs because RealConsole window is hidden and out-of-focus. ntvdm can't utilize DC provided by ConEmu. No API, no way.. You may scroll the window as usual.\nWhat do you mean by \"lose the search state\"?\n180309 is old build.. > and 180528 is alpha\nThat is not correct\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. But I'm still not sure what are you suggesting. Can you illustrate the problem?. 1. I think it's a bell from your shell: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsFeatures.html\n2. https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#wsl-home. Configure your readline in bash. It's not related to ConEmu. I prefer $(...) syntax as more usual. . I don't know what have you configured to start with ConEmu. But it (task/shell) exits immediately and switch -new_console:n is specified.\nTry to run ConEmu.exe -detached -settings to configure.. Build 161206 is to old to compare.\nI need LogFiles.\nJust for now I can say that your shell exits and ConEmu closes thereafter.. Try to enable LogFiles and work as usual (just add -log switch to your ConEmu shortcut).\nI don't know what happens on your side, but some information may be written in logs.\n\nWindows 10 Pro Spring 2018 Stable\nWhat is exact Windows version?. Also, the description may be ambiguous, and screen-recording may help.. Two suppositions\n\n\nChildGui?\n\nSome dialog (ConEmu update arrive, close/restart/whatever confirmation, ...) in background?. And questions: during continuous blinking\n\n\ncan you close ConEmu by cross click?\n\ncan you open other window like TaskManager?. Single flicker of elevated RealConsole is by design yet.\n\nNext time you see infinite flickering if you could make MemoryDump of ConEmu process it may help too.\n. I see events, but I don't understand why they happen\n\n7:56:35.027 Wheel Dir:-120 LParam:{3589,607} Real:{3589,607}\n7:56:35.027 -- skipped (isInternalScroll)\n\nWhat have you started in the console? Wheel events were not processed by ConEmu internal scrolling procedure.\n\n7:56:44.252 Activation by mouse: HWND=x005319E8 msg=x21 wParam=x5319E8 lParam=x2010007\n\nStrange one. Have you tried to activate ConEmu by clicking on the scrollbar?\n\n7:56:45.071 Activation by mouse: HWND=x005319E8 msg=x21 wParam=x5319E8 lParam=x2010001\n\nThat click represents client area. Were there two clicks or only one?\n\n7:56:45.209 CFrameHolder::OnNcActivate(1,x0)\n7:56:45.209 CFrameHolder::OnNcActivate(0,x0)\n\nYep. These messages ConEmu receives when Windows activates and deactivates the window.\nSo the questions\n\nCan you reproduce it now? And if you can, are you able to create memorydumps of ConEmu.exe (GUI process)?\nWhat have you started in ConEmu?\nHow exactly have you switched focus? Where have you clicked in ConEmu and how many times?\n\nScreenshots?. Have you enabled options?\n\n\nInject ConEmuHk\n\nSkip focus events. Looks like not a ConEmu issue. I've just caught the same behavior in the another applications.\n\nIf something was started under debugger in Visual Studio 2017, even if all threads of debugging process were paused, any application starts blinking on activation, regardless of the way activation was done (Win+R, Alt+Tab, click on the TaskBar, etc.). If I pause VS debugger, the problem is gone.\nWindows 10 17134\n(recorded gif has slow FPS, just for illustration)\n\n. Reboot fixed the problem.. https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsMouse.html#id2344 ?. I mean your issue may not depends on any other conditions.\nI've asked you for screenshots immediately and only now you provided a link. And I see not a \"powershell prompt\" but ssh to remote machine with bash prompt.\nThat (ssh/bash prompt) + option + click in certain area of the console may be the reason of (probably) expected behavior.. >  I should uncheck \"Change prompt (cmd, powershell) text cursor position with Left Click\"? \nTry it. Checked and unchecked, when you ssh'ed somewhere.. Now the problem is localized and I can do some checks.. BS works out of the box.\nLook at \n\nDefault Tasks\ncygwin/msys and cygwin/msys connector. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. https://conemu.github.io/en/InternetIssues.html. And what helped in your case?. Yes. Feature stopped.\nWhy do you need it?. I'm really surprised that somebody uses this knotty feature.\nDon't you prefer \"real\" xterm-256 color mode?. gh-227\n\nThis is one of the most frustrating things in my RoadMap. Why do you post it here? It's either your shell or Go problem.\nConEmuC.exe -args ///\n. As you may see, both bash and ConEmu pass cout of slashes properly.\nSo it's definitely a Go problem.. Nope. Two slashes from git-bash.\nSo it's not a Go, but Msys2.\nThird-party application problems. Of course not. This one https://www.msys2.org/\nConnector conemu-msys2-64.exe does not do anything more than run your shell (bash) in ConEmu.\nThis is third-party application problem and you may easily check that yourself by running mintty from your msys2 installation.. No hostility at all.\nA lot of users come here complaining to ConEmu, because they observe problems. But they do not understand that these problems are third-party issues. I'm explaining that again, and again, and again...\n\n\nWhy do you post it here? It's either your shell or Go problem.\nYou were wrong here.\n\n\nNope. I was absolutely correct, your shell (bash) runs your application with these switches (stripping one slash). Where I was wrong?\n. @mmendoza01 I think you shall turn on compatibility in cmd.exe, not in ConEmu.. Same as gh-1506. Use default task created for you by ConEmu to run WSL!\nBashOnWindows. * https://conemu.github.io/en/cmder.html\n https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html\n https://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html#add-default-tasks. 1. 180206 is rather old build\n2. Num Lock works OK in my tests in the current build in Win 8.1. The issue is related to https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge\n\nHave you tried official wslbridge release without ConEmu? I believe the problem would be the same.\nHave you tried to put GUID in the Task? https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#wsl-distro\n. Can you provide some more info?\n\nYour account has limited privileges? So how did you install WSL than?\nDo you have WSL entries in\n HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Lxss and\n HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Local Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AppModel\\Repository\\Families. So can you search registry for guid you are using to start bash?\nI plan to create predefined tasks for WSL and your information is disappointing...\nHow did you obtain that guid?. This is standard Windows Tab control.\nThere is official way to ping Microsoft, why not to use Feedback hub?\nTell them that Tab colors are indistinguishable.. Workaround is described in gh-552. I don't think your patch is working. Have you checked it and how?. You may ping me on Twitter or LinkedIn. But I think that GitHub is perfect for conversation.\nLet me explain. Unless ConEmu architecture is fully rewritten and it depends on conhost, there is absolutely no way to create buffer longer than 32K lines.\nBut there are good news: Microsoft console team is working on new API and ConEmu part will become somewhat easier.. That makes sense. Hotkey chords are not supported in ConEmu.\nAren't you able to scroll output with keyboard already?\nAnd you are using Old Builds. You have to describe your request in simple words. Please don't refer to other tools, just describe what do you suggest.. Can you share info from About/SysInfo?. I've moved information to log file instead of assertion. ^[[D means \"move cursor leftward\" and it caused by the feature change text cursor position with LClick\nSo the questions are\n\nWhat have you configured?\nWhere exactly have you clicked and where the cursor was at the moment of the click?. How to enable multiline zsh prompt? An example?. Nope. I don't see any problems with standard oxide theme\n\n\n. Please make log files via connector --log switch, reproduce the issue creating step-by-step screenshots and attach them here (gist or zip).. Does the problem persist in the current ConEmu build?. BTW, I've requested log files long ago: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1609#issuecomment-397907723\nIf the problem persist, I Need them with screenshots.. So, I consider this is solved.\nIf someone still observe the bug, don't hesitate to reopen with logs and screenshots.. You have to use wsl connector!\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#arrows. Does it happen with ConEmu64.exe -basic -detached? (Start predefined Cygwin bash task from menu)\nWhat cygwin version are you trying?. Connector requires modern cygwin1.dll which it was built for.\nAlso you may buid it yourself from sources if you don't like to update cygwin.. Do you mean inversed colors of the first glyph?\n. * Windows 10 stable it insider build?\n I have ConEmu/Far opened for days without issues. But my resolution is considerably smaller.\n The problem comes from RPS I think, that means conhost processes API calls much much slower than expected, if so - ConEmu can't do anything to bypass that.\n* Try to: resize window, set \"sleep in background\" if it wasn't set.. Generally it's a ReadConsoleOutput function called from far.exe/ConEmuC.exe. How many total processes/threads you have running at that moment in your system.. And I'm interested in exact function names in ConEmu64.exe.\nSymbols are available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/files/Symbols/\nOr I need at least exact ConEmu build no. @christinaa Same questions. How do you run zsh? Version of Windows? And I need log files from connector.\nI can't check insider builds now, but I see no problems in the Win10 stable.. That is unfortunately Windows 10 bug.\nWriting to console output the sequence \\b \\b no more proceses expected result, the cursor is moved left twice.\nStable - ok\n\nInsider - broken\n\n/cc @miniksa. Just checked Win10 build 17692, the bug still there. But I created a workaround in ConEmu build 180626.\n\nInterestingly, wsl/zsh started in native conhost window does not suffer from BS problem. Only applications which call WinApi get wrong cursor position.. Interestingly that separate calls provide correct cursor position\nWriteConsoleW(hOut, L\"\\b\", 1, &n, nullptr);\n    WriteConsoleW(hOut, L\" \", 1, &n, nullptr);\n    WriteConsoleW(hOut, L\"\\b\", 1, &n, nullptr);\nand only write three characters at once get us to wrong result\nWriteConsoleW(hOut, L\"\\b \\b\", 3, &n, nullptr);. There is nothing to fix in zsh. And as I've mentioned, native wsl window works properly.. @chris-downs What issue are you talking about? Workaround for this one was implemented in ConEmu three months ago. There are absolutely different console modes supported in ConEmu: WinAPI and POSIX.\nIf you do run git-bash without ConEmu and try to run Python you have the same result, isn't it? So the problem should not be reported here.\nConEmu (and connector) have never done winpty trick. How? I even do not inject ConEmuHk in POSIX processes.\nThe only available solutions:\n\nUse python from git-bash distro. It should be compiled for POSIX. If it does not - report to git-bash-for-windows maintainer.\nUse ConEmuC -std -c python instead of winpty because it does proper trick.. ConEmu just shows what console applications write to the output buffer.\nIf it's posh-git I suppose you are using git with native WinApi console interface. That means, ConEmu event does not received any ANSI color sequences and there cannot be bugs in the ANSI processor.\nMost probably, it's a third-party problem.\nI don't know where the problem has came from, but Log Files may show some information.\n\nWorkaround: reset color in the powershell prompt.. Nope, no color postprocessing. You may take a look at RealConsole to compare outputs. But to be sure, I need Log Files. As usual I need\n\nExact versions of ConEmu and Windows\nSteps to reproduction\n. 1. Screenshot is cropped. Is don't see the StatusBar\nHow do you run WSL?\n\nWindows version?\n. Nope. Predefined task is different.\nThat means you should report the bug to Microsoft.\n\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/DefaultTasks.html\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. I've said and posted link to documentation many times.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#arrows\n\nThe only \"proper\" solution is using Default Task {Bash::bash} generated by ConEmu.. What problem with zsh? What exactly have you tried?. There are examples in docs. Especially for fish. Just change fish to zsh and it's working\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#connector\n. BTW, my Chrome switches to last tab by Ctrl+9. I think Ctrl+0 in ConEmu if fine hotkey for activation of last tab, will implement it.\nBut you can use it already with Macro Tab(7, 1); Tab(6,-1);.. * Default is Ctrl+N\n In the current build you can't bind Ctrl+0 separately\n The next build will do the trick automatically. The only proper solution is default {Bash::bash} task.\nOthers, even if they \"seems\" to be OK does not work completely.\nFor example:\nConEmu is not able to switch AppKeys mode and arrows will not work for you in some cases;\nConEmu is not able to retrieve current working directory from WSL shell;\n256-colors is not working at all;\nJust few issues I recall at once.\nWell, you definitely may use ubuntu1804.exe -cur_console:p5 as ConEmu support any console application to be run in, but all bugs in that case should be addressed to Microsoft.. JFI\nMicrosoft is working on new PTY interface and I'm working on its support in ConEmu ;)\nWhen things go to release I hope neither connector nor wslbridge would be required and speed is expected  to be greatly improved.. 1. There is newer build\n2. I need screenshots or video. I've already seen bugs in ssh.exe from system32. This implementation of ssh does not pass ANSI sequences to terminal (ConEmu) but calls WinApi functions.\nTo be sure, you may run ConEmu64.exe -basic -log -run {cmd}, start ssh and mutt and upload log files. * https://conemu.github.io/en/VersionComparison.html#release-stages\n* https://conemu.github.io/en/OldBuild.html. @CargoCoder Windows version? ssh version?\n. Open-ssh is not a good choice. I use ssh from git-for-windows.. Version of ConEmu?. The \"stable\" is not a number.\nIs there any sense to complain two years old build?\nOld Builds. > thinking that the author -- and presumed releaser -- of the software would know what version that meant. \nThere were dozens of cases when users said \"I'm using latest stable/preview/alpha\". But they didn't after direct question about numbers.\n\nis still present in the brand spanking new latest and greatest version\n\nThat's pity, but now we have a reason to continue investigations.\nCan you please turn on Logging on the DefTerm settings page?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsDefTerm.html#id2866\n. Perhaps dup of gh-1625\n\nYou are using build from 2016 year. Old Builds\nWindows build is omitted\nYou noted PowerShell as your shell. There is no sudo command.\n\nUpdate ConEmu and fix your description. I need ANSI log files and video (preferably)\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiLogFiles.html. 1. https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n2. -dir %CD% in task parameters: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTasks.html#task-parameters-example-dir-c-icon-cmdexe-single. I said Task parameters not a Task command. Different fields.. And note. ConEmu can't map \"linux-only\" paths (e.g. ~/sources) to %CD% because there are no Windows representations for them.. Have you seen my first comment?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n\n/e/src (expected). That is a WSL path.\n\nThat is not a \"wsl path\", it has appropriate Window representation - e:\\src.\n. Please go to my first comment and read it.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1629#issuecomment-403310751\nThere are two steps, perfectly defined. Seems you have done only one step, obviously it's not enough.. If the whole article is too long for you, here is explicit link\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html#connector-ps1. > Add menu item \"Open in editor\" to right-click menu (no into the Edit sub-menu, please!)\nNo, into Edit sub-menu.\nWhy do you think that menu item related to editing/selection/copying may goes out of scope?. Two reasons\n\nEach function in ConEmu may be accessed much faster by keyboard shortcut rather than by mouse\nEvery user has their own preferences and the Menu root level can't hold all requested items.\n\nFir example, I use often the \"Restart console\", but it is not in the root, it is inside its own group. And I don't move it outside, using hotkey instead.\nMan, it's terminal, use keyboard ;-P. Hmm, perhaps this is duplicate and there is already similar request. I don't think it's ConEmu problem. More probably it's the problem of your video driver and Windows 7 video effects.\nConEmu does not use any tricks to draw - the simplest GDI calls are used.\nYou have not provided screenshots, but mention putty as your shell. It is not a shell, but ChildGui and it's drawing problems should be addressed to putty authors.. Skype version?. What if you run ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd and maximize it? What is visible in the shared screen? And I'm not sure what is the \"proper\" part of your screenshots - I see there ConEmu window.. Then something in your ConEmu settings make Skype buggy? Perhaps it's hidden title?. There is nothing to fix in ConEmu. It's Skype problem and the question is \"why it ignores Windows with alpha transparency\".. I think this may be noted in FAQ sections.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuFAQ.html#faq-10\nPR would be appreciated. Have you checked the digital signature of the ConEmuSetup.180626.exe?\nIt starts without any compatibility problems on my Win10 and Win8.1 machines.. Nope. It's a duplicate of gh-1385. There are already created issues about full true color support.\nAnd I hope in the next alpha ConEmu build this support may appear (in connector tasks).. For the sake of reliability ConEmu injects ConEmuHk only into processes when they bring their window to foreground (get focus).\nThat is by design and I have no intention to change that.\nRun ConEmu instead of cmd. Seems like you don't use proper method to run WSL\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#connector. Also, https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\nCtrl-Win-Alt-Space. The following files are expected in the folder\n\nDosBox.exe\nDosBox.conf  (you may just make a copy of DosBox_Sample.conf)\nAlso seems like files SDL.dll and SDL_net.dll are required by DosBox.exe itself, but ConEmu does not check for their existence. ConEmu should show info message like this:\n\n\nDosBox files must be located here:\nD:\\Software\\Emulators\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\DosBox\\\n1. Copy files DOSBox.exe, SDL.dll, SDL_net.dll\n2. Create of modify configuration file DOSBox.conf\n. ConEmu expects conf file inside its folder because there may be special rules for drive mapping. There are examples for different shells in docs, have you read it?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html\n. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nn-shobjidl-ivirtualdesktopmanager. RightCtrl+Number are used by default to switch tabs.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsHotkeys.html. The bug is inside npm.\nYou may confirm that by starting outside of ConEmu the mintty from git bash (default git bash terminal).. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. So, do you confirm it's reproducible in mintty?. You are trying to run console application (npm/vue) designed for WinAPI from terminal designed for POSIX API. Image you try to run Notepad under Ubuntu (and I mean real Linux installation, not WSL).\n\nObviously you have to use either proper versions of software (npm designed for POSIX, Notepad compiled for Linux) or use wrappers like Wine.\nSurprisingly there is wrapper in ConEmu too\nConEmuC -std -c vue create test-project. Required information from issue template is absent. Please update. Possible duplicate gh-1625. You can do it. What is the question?\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Tasks.html#jump-list\n. That is because you've checked \"Copy on LBtn release\" & \"Reset selection on LBtn release\".\n. And even than, I can't reproduce the issue.. Pear run ConEmu with -log switch, reproduce paste problem and push here log files. What about 190301?. https://conemu.github.io/en/InternetIssues.html. If you are using connector, I need its log file\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiLogFiles.html#connector. Seems like you hardly modified logs, they are not suitable to produce any valid output. That is mintty.\n\n. I've also noted that there are no ConEmu's special ANSI sequences about console size. Are you sure you are using actual ConEmu and connector?. If you still have freezed console, you may create memory dumps of processes ConEmu64.exe and ConEmuC64.exe. They may help. Definitely you can, appreciated. That's why I hate cropped screenshots. 1. Uninstall cmder\n2. Install ConEmu\n3. Profit? ). Screenshots are from cmder, so I doubt.... Please run ConEmu with -log switch and provide the logs with duplicated lines.\nWhen you run ssh (Win32-OpenSSH) it does not push ANSI to ConEmu, but writes process sequences internally and calls WinAPI functions to produce output. ConEmu just shows that output.. Hmm? I didn't get your point with \"log in cmd.exe\".\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/LogFiles.html. And perhaps more interesting are ANSI log files:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiLogFiles.html. * https://conemu.github.io/en/KeyboardShortcuts.html#Full_list search for \"monitor\"\n* https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsSizePos.html - fixed/free position of quake window. So, you describe current behavior and it is by design.\nWhen \"suppress bells\" is checked you don't hear the sound, but to notify user ConEmu may flash window/taskbar if the \"Disable all flashing\" is not checked.\nWhat is the question?. Such requests exists already.\nSee gh-1608 and drawing label. Properly written WinAPI application may access console API because RealConsole exists when you run connector. But they never do, because they see inherited I/O handles and they have no intention to reopen them.\nOn the other hand, when you use connector, ConEmuHk is not injected into the cygwin/msys/wsl processes. Reason are either simple or obvious: speed, compatibility, binary difference. That means that ConEmu can't automatically switch POSIX to WinAPI modes.\nBut user can do that himself\n$ ConEmuC.exe -std -c node -p -e \"Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)\"\n\nfalse\n. If you want to bear multiple bugs of cygwin/msys console implementation, you may run zsh.exe directly.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html. I've already explained that above.\nConnector emulates POSIX pty. Applications written exactly for that pty interface (cygwin/msys) are able to utilize full power of that pty view I/O handles they inherit from parent process. Applications written for WinApi can't utilize WinApi console functions on that handles obviously, they are not WinAPI capable.\nThere is absolutely no sense to run node via connector.\nThere is no sense to run winpty from connector, coz ConEmuC does the work better.\n. How does git-for-windows relates to WSL?. You may (and probably should?) install git via apt.\nAnyway, it's a question to wslbridge why only specially defined environment variables are passed to WSL side. You may define them in you task just after --wsl switch like -eUSERPROFILE.\n. Definitely. Windows can't restore hidden window.\nThat is not a bug, but user choice.. Repro steps are not complete or clear.\nWhat do you do exactly on step 2?. Mentioned option https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsDefTerm.html#id2660 corresponds only for DefTerm feature.\nWhen you run something from ConEmu, DefTerm is not working, so it's user choice to append or -new_console:n.\nI suggest you to define an alias for start to get preferred behavior.. Perhaps. If you convince me why you do not want to see the output of fast executed command.. I didn't get the question. Illustrate your problem. gh-210?. That is gh-210. Have you ever tried?\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. Start WSL in ConEmu instead.\nRead docs I've posted. Nope. The only proper way for now is described in docs.\nWslbridge.. There is gh-38\nI don't like the idea of setting completely different fonts (names) per console.. I don't see trimming on your screenshots. What do you mean?. What is your taskbar location?. Please run ConEmu64.exe -basic -log -run cmd, maximize/restore the window, close it and push LogFiles here.. As workaround you may set up padding.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsSizePos.html#pad-size-pixels. Describe problems with screenshots please. gh-1608. Linked page says explicitly how you have to run the script. And you get with -cur_console:h0:\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#xterm_256_color_processing_requirements. Why do you crop screenshots?\nWhat perl version you are trying?. git-for-windows is msys based.\nYou have to run it properly via connector.\n\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsys.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/DefaultTasks.html\n. You shouldn't run POSIX tools from PowerShell!\nI guess Vim is also from git-for-windows. It's Msys application (POSIX API) they works properly ONLY under connector.\n\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/VimXterm.html. Just run it via ConEmuC.exe -c. I know the problem, but not being any of RTL language speaker, it's hard to read and understand proper outline and direction.\nIt would help a lot, if you may create reliable test and the screenshots of expected and wrong output.\nFor example, simple \"hello world\" from any programming language.\nAlso, it's not clear to me, what is expected behavior on English text containing parts of RTL.\nIt would help if you may provide a program which may be used as etalon.\nI saw the Konsole in your gist, but it's rather hard to test and compare.. Exactly.\nWell, terminal may treat each line of output as text chunk (which may be incorrect in editors like Vim), and use bimap from physical character index in the line with its position onscreen. But I don't know how home/end/clear must behave.\nAlso, there may be a problem with formatting: mc, far manager, ls/dir, etc.. This is exact duplicate of the existing issue.. gh-1385. Nope. It's only your preference. The default was set by explicit user request (regardless to my own opinion, but I don't use quake mode). Sorry but rejected. https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#connector. I don't understand your question. Illustrate?. Have you tried to look into keyboard shortcuts? It's a Win+N by default.. What is the question ?. Your screenshots are blurry.\nAnyway, that looks like a Third-party application problems. It looks like you run your own application, and this application outputs short strings.. The \"not enough memory\"  message in most cases means Third-party application problems related to inability handle long backscroll buffer ConEmu sets by default.\nTry darcs -cur_console:h0, decrease ConEmu width/height, etc.. Ah, I see.\nBut I can't do with that anything unfortunately.\nConEmu shows the text exactly as it was emitted to StdOut by application. Line by line. Without changes of the characters.\nIn your case, the \ud83d\udd0b consists of two characters (surrogate pair) which occupies two cells in the RealConsole. That means that in some circumstances (output starts from odd cell index) you have these characters on separate lines.. Even if I try to check for IS_HIGH_SURROGATE at the end of line and for IS_LOW_SURROGATE at the start of the next line (complication of code) there may be not enough space to draw it. And where it should be painted? At the end or at the start?. Nope. It works as expected, your background and foreground colors are set to your values.\nThese colors have no effect on preconfigured prompt.. Don't exit your shell?\nOr don't leave empty ConEmu window and choose and close the terminal?. Neither ssh nor rdp conforms to ConEmu ideology\nssh Look, you already can run ssh client in ConEmu, can't you? No sense to move huge parts of code to implement absolutely the same ssh, but inside ConEmu.\nrdp That's worse. ConEmu is terminal, it's intended to show (simplifying) plain text stream from console applications. RDP is \"terminal\" focused on graphical output. ConEmu will not go that way. It would be too complicate.. It looks like we may connect to some remote host PTY. If so, ConEmu may support this option when br-pty branch will be ready.\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/08/02/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/. What for? User don't need to edit predefined schemes.. That is duplicate and known Microsoft bug.\nJust wait until the fix get to Windows build.. ConEmu itself doesn't provide the ability to run \"vim bla-bla-bla\".. Please read docs, it's all there\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. So? The message states that far.exe not found.. Have you ever opened settings dialog?. Are you looking for gh-1677?. But I consider your suggestion make sense. It's cmder, so I can't be sure what package (vim) you are trying.\nANSI log file contains x27, so this file was not created neither by ConEmu not by connector.. Exact steps please.\nWhen I press Shift+Enter I get new tab in ConEmu.. And what is the problem?. Do you run bash (wsl) via connector?. Few hints\nDon't use /switches, -switches are supported\nDouble quote each argument, not a whole command line\n%cd% is expanded by cmd, use appropriate PowerShell alias\nProcessExplorer and ProcessMonitor is very useful to determine what is executed actually. You didn't specify p switch at all, so why do you wonder?\nBashOnWindows in ConEmu. There is no way. Bash \"eats\" required ANSI sequences and ConEmu can't adjust modes. The \"X\" is the default working with most of apps.. I'm not sure what do you ask.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#wsl-shell\nHere is an example how to run your own shell. Just change the command?. Why do you try that? It doesn't match my example absolutely.\nChange your shell as in example. Add switches to shell, at the end of command line! Not before --wsl!. Each Unix shell has -c switch (and of course -?)\nAren't you looking for this?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinStartCmd.html. You shall forward this env var to wslbridge.

First of all you have to be more precise.\nShall I guess what are you running?\nShell working directory. If you need to extend prompt function, that is the question for PowerShell usage. When you find the way, PR to docs is appreciated.. ConEmu doesn't need any return from prompt actually. It is expected that proper ANSI sequences are issued to console, doesn't matter how and when.. Perfect, thanks!. ConEmu logs exactly what your console applications print to console output. That is expected behavior.. That happens because your application (cat) have done its work and what you see at the moment it is a transmission via pipes, sockets and API from wsl to ConEmu and conhost.\nI'm working on PTY implementation which should be much faster.. Have you checked that without ConEmu? With the same codepage selected in the console?. I don't believe that ConEmu may be a source of the problem, because it happens outside of ConEmu (as you said). I think you have either installed some Windows update or other third-party tools which causes the problem.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\nTry to compare your environment variables, especially the PATH.\nAlso, the ProcessMonitor may be useful in your case.. What? It's available for years. Just open keyboard shortcuts and search for \"group\". You may change the palette using GuiMacro. I think this is the proper way.. Tabs may be reordered any time, panes - may not.\n. In startup dialog you enter a directory path. Why do you expect %CD% working there?\nIt's created to use with -dir switch in task parameters.. Shell working directory. There is no real mapping of your Unix home directories to Windows file system. That's why ConEmu physically can't start a process in a directory which does not exist.. It's a first time I hear about Bandzip. Because of restrictive environment first (if not last) thing you may provide are log files and screenshots.. Nope. You may either maximize this split, or detach it and reattach.. I have split operations in mind, but there are other critical things. Of course, task scheduler is a service, ConEmu doesn't hook it.\nMoreover, there is no sense to hook it, just run ConEmu with parameters.. I'm not an owner of ESET license, and I believe the complain from their user will have stronger effect.\nIt's the same as False Positives but even worse - one IP is used for many different sites.. Closed as totally rubbish description. Closed as totally rubbish description. This relates to wslbridge code. You may report it there.\nI tend to get rid of wslbridge after creating new pty api support.. Second option already exists: https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsConfirm.html#id1546. No need to overflow you question in dozens of places.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+horizontal+scroll. It looks like a request for Microsoft. Explorer is build such way it's impossible to embed it anywhere.\nDon't do that. There are plenty lot of nice console file managers which interface is native to ConEmu. \nE.g.https://conemu.github.io/en/FarManager.html. Please read docs before asking questions\nShell working directory\nOr even a search in the issues. Show screenshot of the General page. Settings are OK.\nYou said \"start the kitty\". But what do you do for that? I need more precise instructions. I need at least screenshots of the problem. Can anyone approve the fix?. So it should be the same as gh-1159 and gh-1775.\nFeel free to reopen if it comes back. There is already option to fade inactive panes.\nIt's quite enough to distinguish the panes. And I don't like the idea to complicate the settings and the code (which are already complicated).. Nope. This is too short.\nImagine that -nc is a switch of the application you are trying to run.. Hm. I don't understand your problem.\nHave you tried to use -new_console:u:userY?. I don't have smartcard to check this. Can you show step by step screenshots please?. Please use search before posting. At least in the issues\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/Xterm256Colors.html. Because you run the command remotely, ConEmu can't look after your remote processes.\nAs workaround you may use GuiMacro to flash window, rename tab, show message box, beep, whatever... GuiMacro via ANSI and of course you have to use connector.\nSo, just create some alias and &&append it to your command. Please read docs, it's all there\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/CpuIoConsumption.html. Have you taken a look into settings?. The problem comes from bad design of Windows UI API.\nDocked window is treated as Maximized, and thats why applications shall not save coordinates. But Maximized is not Docked \ud83d\ude15 It's impossible to save or restore position without heavy tricks.\nOn the other hand, I've already implemented almost all emulation of docking.. Bad approach.\nIf it works for you it doesn't mean the way is correct.\nIf you store coordinates in pixels, than if you close the window in maximized position\n1. User will not be able to restore window to the expected size (usually smaller than monitor)\n2. If your display is changed and you run the application, you start it with wrong coordinates due to different display sizes.. Actually, I have intention to make scrollbars drawn internally. But till it is not implemented, I can try API way.. \n. 190310. > Yup, would be good to just have it as a toggle in the settings menu.\nThere are too many options and toggles.\n\nIs there a way to enable this for conemu shell integration?\n\nOf course. Integration docs for Command field\nExample: -Theme -run {powershell} -cur_console:n\n\n. @musm Do you mean taskbar jump lists? If not, you may just modify shortcut properties.. Jump lists are tricky \ud83d\ude44\nAdd -theme in Task parameters.\nGo to the \"Task bar\" settings page and update jump lists, disable \"auto update\" if it's enabled.\nReturn to \"Tasks\" page, remove \"-theme\" from parameters.\nSave settings. Good point, I'll check it. Have you read docs?\nCPU and I/O consumption. It doesn't mention 64 bit exclusively. Do you know the meaning of square brackets?\nPTY API is not supported yet, continuous scanning of conhost surface may produce consumption.\nMoreover, the conhost itself may produce consumption too.. Try to run ConEmu64.exe -basic {bash}.. Win+R\n. Sorry\nConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}\n\n. By the way, you issue doesn't show were this utilization occurs.\nI recommend ProcessExplorer to check.. I've never seen such large utilisation in rest (it's usually lower than a percent on my home PC).\nWhen you run in ConEmu something producing massive output to the console, utilization augmentation is expected.\nI can't test your exact build of Windows 10.. Unclear and ambiguous\n\nWhat exact shell do you run? What exact command line?\nScreenshots?\nWho hangs?\n. You should try to compare with wsltty.. @littleq0903 Please be more detailed.. You said: Putty, ssh. So what do you try?\nAnyway, that is Third-party application problems. I'll try to repro the issue with Ctrl+K.\n\nBut it would be better to fix both problems, so I need either description of broken text or (better) ansi log files with screenshots.. > typing over existing line I want to use, using the \"history\" function, text got overwritten although the line extended.\nDo you talk about bash prompt here?. Nope. Simultaneous keypresses are allowed with modifiers only.\nKey chords are not supported too.. I haven't understand your question. You can't disable that info. During resize new dimensions are shown either in the StatusBar or (temporarily) in the upper left corner.. 1. Exact Windows version, paste to gist About/SysInfo contents\n2. Output from command ConEmuC -CheckUnicode\n3. What is the vim you are running?. No, I've asked about text information from ConEmu about dialog, have SysInfo ;)\nAbout/SysInfo\n. Never mind. I see the data on screenshot. Question: do you use xterm mode in vim?. No update yet.\nThat may be a bug in WinAPI, but I can't be sure yet.. 1. The issue is malformed\n2. Required information is absent\n3. Cmder is on screenshot, not ConEmu..

I don't think it's ConEmu problem.\nIsn't your shell the PowerShell? It uses WinAPI to output data.\nBut I see \"lambda\" in your prompt. Isn't it cmder?\nAnyway, please read this\nThird-party application problems\nCmder. Have you checked the same in PowerShell started without ConEmu?. You can already. Nope. It's just your color configuration.\nGo to the Fonts page.. I doubt you are using connector. AFAIR there must be g bash.exe in the StatusBar. I need to check this. Old Builds. Also, it's a Cmder and clink.\nIt's not a ConEmu problem. To be certain you should run from Win+R\nConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}\n\nAnd compare the behavior. Definitely. ConEmu simulates Unix Primary Selection of you don't move mouse cursor.\nDouble click to select word, don't move the cursor (leave it inside selection) and Right click..

And what is the question?\nUse templates. Network path are starting with two backslashes. Your post still doesn't show full task contents.\nPerhaps you need quotes.\nJust use ProcessExplorer to examine what PATH got kputty in real.\nAnyway, it's a crazy behavior, when application fail to find dlls in its own folder, where its binary is located. I believe it a reason for kputty bugreport.. Few insights\n\nYou are using very old version, so its behavior may be unexpected\nTo check the actual results (without ProcessExplorer) replace kputty with simple cmd.exe and print your PATH from the prompt\nIt's expected that -new_console may be located anywhere in the command (I prefer the tail), but again, you stuck on the very old build\nAnd you even do not need -new_console - just put your required /dir bla-bla-bla in the task properties\nI see no pros in your last comment. Environment is already inherited in Tasks, and in any Task command you may set all required vars to required values. Moreover, current build support Task nesting/inheritance - you may do nice things with them.\n. I don't believe in that. Most probable your comparison is not fair.\nThird-party application problems\n\nCheck user credentials under which you run Far.\n. > You also can put a line in Settings/Startup/Environment in ConEmu:\n\nnet use S: \\server\\shared\n\nNope. Environment page supports only limited set of commands, which ConEmu executes internally (set, chcp, alias).\nBut net use ... & ... can be put in the task contents.. How do you run zsh?\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#wsl-shell. Can anyone approve the fix?\n@isamuelson?. 190217?. The message comes from cygwin and is crazy...\nTry to download ConEmuPack.180626.7z, unpack it to some folder and run explicitly the unpacked executable: ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}. Any changes?\nTry ProcessMonitor to check if cygwin1.dll is loaded from the ConEmu/wsl folder. Perhaps something wrong is with your OS.\nEnsure that ConEmu is not started under any compatibility options.\nIf the problem persists - read this article: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinHeap.html. Show (in gist/pastebin) info from ConEmu/About/SysInfo. Seems like it's not complete.\nRun ConEmu64.exe -log -basic -detached. Close the window and push logfile here.. Do you have cygwin installation? If not try to install cygwin x64 and run mintty.\nif it works - try to copy cygwin1.dll from this distro.. In general - this means a problem with dll load base. Causes - third-party tools like AV, or even some changes in Windows ASLR.. I'll try to reproduce that.\nAnyway, I'm interested in crash dump of the powershell.exe process.. https://conemu.github.io/en/CrashDump.html#How_to_create_required_dump. Run PowerShell without ssh module and than call Start-SshAgent. Please use some sane file hosting. DropBox, GoogleDrive, etc. are nice and reliable.. I have no intention to abandon the project.\nBut I have no time to work on bugs and features at the moment. Unfortunately. A lot of tasks on new work ;). Not enough information.\nConEmu doesn't position scrollbar at arbitrary position. It's always about cursor position, which in turn is your shell responsibility.. ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd /d\nand\nConEmu64.exe -basic -run {cmd}\n. Also, I'm interested in log files with repro. Logs, screenshot, note which variant reproduces the problem. @miniksa This looks like a Windows 10 regression. Can you please check it?\nSteps to 100% repro:\n Download gh1780.cmd and any of latest ConEmu builds\n Run the following ConEmu64.exe -basic -nokeyhooks -run gh1780.cmd (specify full path to gh1780.cmd or run in the directory containing it)\nWe get second tab (with cmd) unexpectedly scrolled upwards.\n\n. I have to read messages twice before answer.... I've updated to Win10 build 18342 and for me the problem is gone!. @asolopovas Have you tried the test I'd posted? https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1780#issuecomment-467191175\nAnyway you are on the older Windows 10 and that may be a problem.\nI strongly doubt that same ConEmu build have different behavior on different bitness. They have same codebase and run same conhost/shells.. You may change the shape of the cursor\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#Terminal_modes. What is your vim from and hub how do you run it?. vim --version\nTurn on Terminal modes on the StatusBar and show screenshot. I suppose you should ask the author of win-sudo.. What is bash from? WSL/MinGW? I see MinGW in the prompt.\nHow did you run bash on the left and on the right?\nI suppose you know, that mingw works differently when started from conhost (directly, bash.exe from Win+R) and from mintty.\nThe same with ConEmu - directly and via connector.. Tasks file format is the same as Task itself.\n\"Auto save/restore opened tabs\" works unless you press Reset on your PC.. Why do you think it's a ConEmu issue?\nHave you tried the same from cmd?\nThird-party application problems. If the problem persists in build 190301 please make ansi log files with repro and new screenshot.. Actually, I didn't understand the purpose of FR.\nWhat do you want to do with that key?. Why not just start new console dialog (even via the hotkey) and choose you Task there?. I suppose I've found the problem.\nCan you build ConEmu yourself or you'll wait for new build?. I've tried your steps (in build 190108), but mouse works as expected before and after...\nScreenshots, please, with StatusBar visible.. Please read docs. It works perfectly.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html. @mcandre How do you imagine \"out of the box\" work?\n\nnot for all the available MinGW, MSYS, Cygwin, Git Bash, Command Prompt, PowerShell environments.\n\nFalse. All of them are supported.. You have selected wrong place to report.\nI'm not a maintainer of PowerShell. ConEmu shows exactly what console applications prints.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\nJust reveal RealConsole and compare.. I see on the first screenshot in the status bar version 180626 (good enough) but the size of the console is 318x43. I have strong doubt that the are 318 cells in a row on screen. So either your console app or profile set the size of RealConsole (press Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space) to such size.. 99c88ba3. Take a look at my previous comment. There is a sha with your commit, rebased on daily branch. All new commits should go there.. Thanks for PR, by the way ;). Have you read docs? There is GuiMacro\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/GuiMacro.html#SetOptionName. Turn of \"Auto save window size and position on exit\"?. I'm not sure what are you doing?\nDo you run in ConEmu something?\nIf you run some App (which is not able to support high-dpi properly) from ConEmu (which notes Windows that it's high-dpi aware) you may see some strange artifacts.. Unfortunately I can't activate Tablet mode now on my PC.\nCan you share more info? Dump, screenshots, logs?. Have you tried GuiMacro?. You are absolutely wrong\n\nAny of ConEmu distro may be used as portable: https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuXml.html\nBoth ConEmu.exe and ConEmu64.exe may run any shell bitness.\nPlease don't use paf format if you do not know what is intended for. Use Pack instead.. > ConEmu64.exe installed to directory and available to launch.\n64bit tasks autopopulated\n\n\n\nExact examples, please!. You don't need ConEmu64.exe to run 64bit console applications.. Why you have said that \"used shell\" is \"cmd\"?\nPlease read docs how to run and use WSL in ConEmu. Nope. Shell is a command interpreter you run in ConEmu (on startup) - cmd, PowerShell, wsl bash, msys bash, cygwin bash, etc.\nJust VIM is not enough. What distro it's from? How do you run it?. That is because you didn't follow the guide link to which I've posted.\nYou have to run wsl via connector and wslbridge.. The docs describe how to turn desired terminal mode on start (https://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html#syntax). Look at -new_console:p....\nBut it's strongly not recommnded way. ConEmu will not be able to change expected terminal mode during run.. I don't understand you.\n\nArrow keys work well in vim when I run ConEmu through ConEmu64.exe -run {bash}\n\nSo, if arrow keys are working well, why have you opened this issue?\nThe contents of the task on the screenshot is not correct. But you already have proper task {bash}, just use it.. The {Bash::bash} already set up for you connector and wslbridge.\nThere is no other way (yet) to run bash properly.. Nope. It's OK\n\n. Just look into settings\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsPaste.html. I wonder, isn't it better to implement max CPS aka paste speed?\nAnd what line delay in ms do you use?. Yep, characters per second.\nI think, that simple delay (which is definitely simpler to implement) may be not enough if lines are long. This is hardcoded because it highly depends on options and current keyboard state.\nAnd yes, it may be disabled. Look at the Tab bar settings page.\n. It's better to use GuiMacro. I'm afraid that all yours sessions, started from kitty launcher have one PID. Aren't they?. You said \"ls\" and \"ctrl-l\". But mentioned shell \"cmd\" doesn't provide \"ls\" command and \"ctrl-l\" shortcut.. So, why do you think it's a ConEmu problem?. Thank you for the report.\nHowever, the crash dump was created by old version 180626, not a 190108.\nAnd the crash itself is strange:\nUnhandled exception at 0x00007FFC928661AD (propsys.dll) in Trap-180626-15168.dmp: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x000000AA5C8FDC90.\nSuch crashes usually means something bad in your OS.

What font settings do you use?\nI see proper picture\n\n. Have you tried latest release? I mean for drawing issues\nI think that mouse in tmux should be separate issue, and seems like one already exist. dup: gh-1835. Yeah, I've noted in Twitter the problem with 24th build. dup gh-1835. > On Linux and macOS, the TERM_PROGRAM variable is set to the terminal name\nThat is not true. I've checked three terminals on Ubuntu, and only one defines this variable. And it's vscode :). I'm not against the unification, but does it make sense?\nQuick googling shows same proposals were rejected: https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/776, https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/781\nBTW, many terminals set VTE_VERSION variable.. And COLORTERM. I'm in doubt, really...\nOn the one hand unification is good, but on the other hand neither terminal I've checked in Ubuntu sets this variable.\nWe may not count vscode (it's not a real terminal and it's a cross-platform application).\nI decides not to spawn more environment than we have already.\nBut! You may add set TERM_PROGRAM=conemu in the Environment and it will answer you case.. So, do you observe the problem now or not?. Try to disable Long console output. 190310. I do not observe the problem neither with with standard settings nor with yours ConEmu_settings_rendering_error.xml:\n\nBut I do use mintty, not a wsltty. And I run the following:\nConEmu64.exe -basic -runlist C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\mintty.exe - ||| C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\mintty.exe - -new_console:sV\nSo, the problem is either with wsltty, or mintty settings (try it with clean profile), or your display settings (scaling), or anything else (like enabled compatibility mode for ConEmu).. I don't observe that.\nTo be sure, run this:\nconemu64.exe -basic -run {PowerShell Core}\nAnd press Win or WinQ key. In my tests - no garbage in pwsh prompt.\nThat should be either third-party software or old Windows 10 build. I'm now on Win 10 1903.. conemu64.exe -basic -run powershell.exe -noprofile\n. Can't reproduce, it disappears in my tests.\nCan you attach log files with repro?. Not a console out logs.\nI'm interested in ConEmu LogFiles.. AFAIR, ConEmu used two finger scroll. @asolopovas You run ssh without connector. That means all issues have to be addressed to openssh authors. Simple check: run from WinR the cmd.exe and try it there.\n@kbirger How do you run WSL?. https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html. > I tried in Win R cmd.exe it works same way as in powershell, by which I mean without any issues. Only If I run it from via conemu I face these issues.\nVery very strange. If you do not use the connector, ConEmu does not process any ANSI (it just does not receive them!) and it shows just the contents of conhost surface.\nAnd that means you have to see same problems in cmd/powershell.\nSo, I believe the tests/comparison was not fair.\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html. In comparison you should take care about buffer height and window size.. May depend on monitor config. Don't know, will investigate. Unless you run ssh in connector, all display issues should be addressed to your ssh client authors. Same as gh-1846. @hcc1187 Are you sure that now build (190303) works and (190310) doesn't?. There is no status bar on screenshots, no build, no screen sizes, no buffer info. 1. How about 190310? It's newest one.\n2. If it's the same, I need logs from connector, add --logs before --wsl, reproduces the problem (first occurrence is enough), make screenshot of this moment, and terminate your wsl session.. > 2. --logs before --wsl errors with:\nSorry. The correct switch is --log.. Dup: gh-1852. There is no such hotkey in ConEmu.\nPerhaps, console receives wrong sequence. You may check it with https://conemu.github.io/en/KeyEvents.html#key-reader. What vim? There is a dozen of different distros and versions. Ho do you run it?. Thanks for reporting. New upload procedure have unexpected bugs :(. My opinion in short - this would not work.\nConhost is a special system process, there is no sense to hook it and I think it may be even dangerous.\nNew PTY API allows us to start console applications inside virtual terminal, but doesn't (yet) allow to intercept console creation.\nPerhaps @miniksa or @zadjii-msft may confirm or disprove my vision?. Anyway, hacking with verifier reg keys are intended for debug purposes only, not for production. IMO. My main concern is that in such way we may harm all console processes.\nConhost.exe is started for any console subsystem, regardless console window visibility status.\nAt the moment I can't say may this technique work seamlessly or not. This requires investigations.... This looks like a common problem of msi, not related to ConEmu.\nGoogling: https://appuals.com/how-to-fix-error-code-2755-when-installing-programs-or-applications/. mp_FarInfo is never allocated by the object.\n. It's a 2dee092 regression. I'll fix it there.\n. This is initialization procedure. It's inappropriate to skip any functions without terminating the rest of startup procedure.. The arg is not a type, it's an instance. So arg.OnSrvStarted is OK, but arg::OnSrvStarted would not be compiled ever.. This is absolutely wrong.

A good starting point though is just to open a file longer than the length of the terminal with syntax highlighting and do VG in normal mode (SHIFT-V SHIFT-G) and then ESC. This should achieve the affect with the gray shown above. However this is just one of many cases in which it occurs, and it happens with differing severity at different times.

If the URL links to one, it's because imgur sometimes just puts .jpg at the end of the URL that is easily copyable to the clipboard in order to ensure a direct link, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the actual file is a JPEG. Also, a GIF could very well represent these images if the color count is below 256, which is certainly possible, but I would just use a PNG anyways and optimize it losslessly anyways to be sure since that would both ensure it was unmodified and even if the bit depth only needed to be set at 8, an optimized PNG is still smaller than a GIF anyways, and I'm not doing any animation.\n. > Trolling?\nWho, @m0n?\n.

If I use the standard Shift+Win+(Left or Right Arrow) shortcuts while ConEmu has focus in your example, then when it gets moved over by Windows, it'll be displaced down/up by the width of the taskbar as it jumps between monitors.

Depends on the shell you are using. For example, in Powershell:\nfunction nano { &\"${env:USERPROFILE}\\Desktop\\Nano\\nano.exe\" -new_console @args }\nThen run \"nano $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts\", and add that line to your profile.\n.

Perhaps, ConEmu could provide an option to expand TABs when pasting?\nOr just replace TAB with  SPACE?\n.

You are using the official vim 7.4 build (clue is: compiled Aug 10 2013 14:33:40).\nNewer builds with lots of patches can be found here.\nHowever, I don't think a newer build will solve your problem.\n. Have you tried starting vim with different terminal types?\nvim -T win32 (default if TERM is unset), vim -T xterm, vim -T ansi, etc. (check actual type with :set term? inside vim).\n\nxylographe the link you've given us is for gvim not vim for terminal.\n\nThe executables (gvim-7-4-977.exe, etc.) are installers, which install both graphical and terminal vim.\nIf you prefer, you can open and extract files from the installer with 7-Zip.\n. When you get the \"Failed to create Main font!\" error message, you can select the Default font charset to alleviate the problem.\nI think, limiting the list of available fonts would be less user friendly.\n. It looks like your \"standalone\" test is using mintty, not conhost.\nDid you use cygwin/msys terminal connector with ConEmu?\n. Not so strange, the arrow keys send a sequence that starts with 0x1B (ASCII ESC).\nVim doesn't seem to recognise the sequence as one, hence it acts on each byte separately.\n. Could be caused by ConEmuHk injection.\n. @eromoe  The square means that the typeface you use has no glyph for the \u30fb character.\n. @eromoe Have a look at \"Main console font\" and \"Alternative font\" in Settings > Main.\n.

Being able to ^= and ^- to make a specific pane \"huge\" and then return it back to normal would be great.  Ideally, the row x col would remain the same and the window would grow and shrink in size to accommodate. . Coming from both Mac OS X and X-Windows.  I usually have about 10 ConEmu windows open, each with different terminals logged into different machines... with editors running etc.  Many of those aren't relevant to a troubleshooting session.  So on both UNIX and Mac OS X (iTerm2) I can dynamically adjust the fontsize (which in-turn grows the window to keep the same column count).  It's common behavior in other terminal emulation systems, so I'm not sure why this would be unintuitive.\nMaybe I don't understand the term \"cell\" size; I had assumed that meant the size of a cell containing a single monotype character.\nBasically, I have a common use pattern where I take my 80x24 terminal.. and want just that one window \"really big\".. then I want it back normal size.

This is\n                expected by most users.\n\"double\":       Use twice the width of ASCII characters.\n                                                *E834* *E835*\nThe value \"double\" cannot be used if 'listchars' or 'fillchars'\ncontains a character that would be double width.\n\nThere are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for\nthose characters are solely based on how many octets they take in\nlegacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,\nRegistered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,\ntherefore those fonts have \"wide\" glyphs for them.

Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or\nVim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font\n(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with \"-cjkwidth\" option.),\nthis option should be set to \"double\" to match the width perceived\nby Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has\nto be set to \"double\" under CJK Windows 9x/ME or Windows 2k/XP\nwhen the system locale is set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode\nStandard Annex #11 (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).\n\nVim may set this option automatically at startup time when Vim is\ncompiled with the |+termresponse| feature and if |t_u7| is set to the\nescape sequence to request cursor position report.\n\n```\nand I find the vim's sources code(file : src/mbyte.c):\n/*\n           * For UTF-8 character \"c\" return 2 for a double-width character, 1 for others.\n           * Returns 4 or 6 for an unprintable character.\n           * Is only correct for characters >= 0x80.\n           * When p_ambw is \"double\", return 2 for a character with East Asian Width\n           * class 'A'(mbiguous).\n           */\n                 int\n           utf_char2cells(c)\n                 int         c;\nI also track the ConEmu's sources, but I can't find how to fix it.\nhope helpful.\n. As for scrolling - ConEmu always shows real console position, unless it was scrolled virtually.

    "gene-pavlovsky": "I don't get it. For me, it still shows the full path, rather than the basename (last part of the path)\n. @Maximus5 Well I replaced %s with %d, what else is there to look at? It doesn't have effect on Far at all (and setting %d in Far settings didn't work either). I'm mostly using Cygwin bash, my PROMPT_COMMAND includes a call to ConEmuC -StoreCWD.\n. The OP posted a screenshot using %d followed by Works great! comment and then the issue was closed. What is the solution, then? Please point me to the full list of available tab template field patterns. I didn't find anything relevant here.\n. @Maximus5, sorry to steal your time with my questions.\nTo be honest, there's no %f in the screenshot, and that's where I looked. Now I see in settings themselves there's %f (but it's not mentioned on the Far manager's page).\nIt seems to work half of the times - sometimes it doesn't update. So I changed drive from C:\\ to D:\\, didn't update. Entered a dir, updated. Entered a subdir in that dir, not updated. Entered another subdir, updated.\nSame issue if I use ConEmuC -GuiMacro Rename 1 \"$PWD\" instead of Rename 0 in bash's PROMPT_COMMAND. Should I open another github issue?\n. Sorry for misunderstanding. Right, I posted another issue about Far with more details. Problem in bash was unrelated. That issue was due to:\n```\n19:13:59 /proc\nConEmuC -GuiMacro Rename 1 \"$PWD\"\nError: Current working directory is a virtual Cygwin directory which does\nnot exist for a native Windows application.\nCan't start native Windows application from here.\n```\nSame happens with /cygdrive. Small price to pay, I guess.\n. I renamed mine to /mnt through fstab. If I would be running Linux, that's where Windows filesystems would be mounted.\nAnyway /dev and below, /proc and below and exactly /cygdrive (/mnt in my case) are the places which don't map anywhere within Windows world (e.g. can't open Far pointing there), I have no idea what to update the CWD to. Just change the tab title to the current path?\nBtw, if I change the tab title with ConEmuC -GuiMacro Rename 0 \"title\", what should I do to reset it to the default tab title template (e.g. %c %d)?\n. Genius! Could have guessed it :)\n. Would you consider changing that (i.e. make the setting persistent)? For me, there is no utility in having the settings dialog always on top.\n. Sorry, I can not see the problem with that. It's easy to switch back to the dialog with the taskbar or keyboard shortcut.\n. Win 7 x64 (Win 6.1 build 7601: SP1) with all the latest updates, having exactly same issue.\n. conemu-logs.zip\n. The Keys&Macro mentions auto-conversion for Cygwin in the description of the second paste shortcut, which I don't use (). The first paste shortcut (Shift+Ins) is the one I use, and it does auto-convert paths to Cygwin (/cygdrive/...). I'm using /mnt so to make ConEmu output /mnt/... I have to add :m:/mnt to the new_console task option for Cygwin bash. But it would be good to be able to disable it, for example some of my tasks are ssh to remote servers (Cygwin ssh), doesn't make sense to convert my local Cygwin paths if I paste them there.. Was also curious about that. Extra note: the detached Far has regular Far colors (i.e. as if you run standalone Far), not ConEmu color scheme colors.\nIt appears that ConEmu and Far don't interoperate regarding Far's internal console detach feature?\n. Is there a way to setup a ConEmu hotkey that opens a new Far tab with the same active AND passive panels as the currently active Far tab?\nIf I set up a Far task with /dir \"%CD%\" option and ... Far.exe \"!ConEmuWorkDir!\", then run it via a hotkey, the new tab opens with the active panel equal to the last tab's active panel. But I have no idea how to propagate the passive panel as well.\nIf that is possible, this could be the ConEmu-friendly solution for some use cases when somebody might want to use Far's console detach feature (of course, that doesn't copy the environment variables from old Far to new Far, maybe something else too?).\n. Both topics of this issue work well now.\nThank you :). Tried to:\n- Reset my ConEmu settings.\n- Reset my Far profile.\n- Downgrade Far to latest stable (v3.0 build 4774 x64)\n  Issue is still reproducible (~70-80% of the time the folder is not updated correctly). If I change to a folder and the tab title is not updated, executing any command (e.g. echo) usually updates the tab title - from 1st, 2nd or sometimes 3rd try.\nThis issue is quite problematic since it means tasks launched with /dir \"%CD%\" option are often run in the wrong folder.\nBy contrast, export PROMPT_COMMAND=\"ConEmuC -StoreCWD; $PROMPT_COMMAND\" added to Cygwin bash's PROMPT_COMMAND updates the folder every time without fail. So issue seems to be somewhere between Far and ConEmu.\n. What's also interesting is that executing ConEmuC -StoreCWD from Far's command line doesn't reliably update the tab title. But waiting little bit (doing nothing) then pressing an arrow key (up/down), and the title gets updated.\n. Just installed 180422.\nThe problem is reproducible every time.\nWhenever I change panels, or enter/exit folder, tab title is not updated. Using a hotkey to start e.g. bash in the current directory (/dir \"%CD%\" task parameter) starts it in the previous directory. Waiting doesn't help, but if I press any key, or even move the mouse over the tab, it updates. Sometimes I can see some flicker in the tab title (it updates from the previous dir to my home dir (for some reason), then immediately to the current dir).\nP.S. Currently using Far 3.0.0.5194. Far task: set \"FARHOME=\" & \"far.exe\" /w /p\"%ConEmuDir%\\Plugins\\ConEmu;%FARHOME%\\Plugins\" \"!ConEmuWorkDir!\"\nTask parameters: /dir \"%CD%\"\nPlugin is loaded, version 18.4.22 (build 1804220), path: C:\\Program Files\\Far Manager\\Plugins\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.x64.dll\nP.S. Windows 7 x64\n. Maybe I could try to run ConEmu under a debugger to check things? I have VS Community Edition with C++ and .NET.. Yes, yes (ConEmu, ConEmu Background/Panel Views/Underlines), yes.. Would you please report this to Far manager bug tracker? Your explanation would be of better help to them.\nOr if you prefer I can file a bug myself but then please tell me some more details :) Thanks. Tried the latest alpha and there is a definite improvement. It works mostly correct now.\nThe only noticeable issue is that when changing from C:\\some to C:\\some\\path (for example) sometimes C:\\Users\\gene is shown for just a moment before the path is updated.. I see. Huge thanks, this little thing was slightly annoying me for ages, it's wonderful to see this finally resolved!. I'm using bashcmd, a small program I wrote to be able to use bash on Far's command line. But I think that bug can also be reproduced with a simple test program.\nTo use bashcmd, download https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49471027/far_bash_comspec.7z\nThe instructions are in the README files inside.\nThis issue doesn't happen if I run the commands from a plain Far running on it's own (without ConEmu).\nIf I understand correctly, ConEmuC somehow intercepts execution of any child subprocess, to be able to catch ConEmu options (e.g. -new_console), then runs the child process with the original command line minus the ConEmu-related options, is that right? \nI see there is a cmd.exe invocation involved in the chain of processes originating from Far. This cmd process receives the correct command-line, but then doesn't pass it right because of the \\\". Why doesn't ConEmuC run the bashcmd.exe directly, but does it via cmd.exe? When same Far is executed without ConEmu, it runs bashcmd.exe directly.\n. Bottom line.\nFar tries to run bashcmd.exe with a particular command-line.\nIf that happens in standalone Far, it works and bashcmd.exe receives the correct command-line.\nUnder ConEmu.exe, an additional cmd.exe gets in between Far and bashcmd.exe, as result bashcmd.exe doesn't receive the correct command-line because of some quoting issues (apparently, a combination of \\\" followed by |).\n. When the same command is run in standalone Far. No cmd.exe - no trouble.\n\n. When I was working on this: https://forum.farmanager.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=10242\nI tried many things and quickly realized that executing something involving a lot of quotes and backslashes via cmd.exe is complete torture. The only way to get the exact command line was to run the process directly and obtain the command line via Windows-specific GetCommandLine() rather than using C-standard argc/argv. That's what bashcmd.exe does. Only this way I was able to send the exact command line from Far to bash (bashcmd.sh), with all the quotes, backslashes and such intact.\nIs there a reason ConEmuC uses cmd.exe rather than run the process directly? Besides this issue, there's also the inefficiency of spawning an extra process.\n. \nJust tried it, Far didn't use cmd.\nI've digged deep in Far sources so I know what's happening in there. If you wanna see for yourself, see execute.cpp. Far checks the command line (PartCmdLine()) according to specified ComspecCondition option, or default if none specified - by default it checks for presence of any of <>|& characters not within quotes.\nYour 7z command line doesn't have any of those characters, therefore Far proceeds to directly execute 7z.exe (see Execute() function).\nIf Far finds the command line too complex (pipes, redirections etc.), it uses ComSpec to execute the command - either System.Executor.Comspec (far:config option) if set, or ComSpec env var.\nIn my case, I've set System.Executor.Comspec to %FAR_ComSpec% which is an env var pointing to my bashcmd.exe (all of these setup details described in the README of bashcmd 7z archive I've reference in a previous comment).\n. Some curious findings.\n- grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sort -u - fails (intermediary cmd.exe)\n  bashcmd.exe: cmdLine=\"C:\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\bin\\bashcmd.exe\"  /S /C \"grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4\n- grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sort -u -cur_console - fails (intermediary cmd.exe)\n  bashcmd.exe: cmdLine=\"C:\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\bin\\bashcmd.exe\"  /S /C \"grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4\n- grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sort -u -new_console - runs in new console and works (no intermediary cmd.exe)\n  bashcmd.exe: cmdLine=\"C:\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\bin\\bashcmd.exe\" /S /C \"grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sort -u\"\nAlso, if I run this command from a Cygwin bash under ConEmu, it executes correctly without any intermediary cmd.exe.\n```\nexport BASHCMD_DEBUG=pause\nbashcmd.exe /S /C  \"grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sort -u\"\nbashcmd.exe: cmdLine=C:\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\bin\\bashcmd.exe /S /C \"grep external_id video_ids.txt | cut -d\\\" -f4 | sort -u\"\n```\nSo for some reason the issue only occurs when running under Far in current console.\nP.S. It doesn't seem plausible to me that Far spawns this cmd.exe, since in Far my Comspec is set to C:\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\bin\\bashcmd.exe. So I can only imagine ConEmuC is starting this cmd.exe for some reason.\n. I don't really understand why you closed this issue.\nMy primary point here is not reporting some particular hotkey causing issue with 3rd-party software. It is a feature request: I want to be able to disable or modify any of the predefined key bindings. At the moment they are forced on the users.\nAs for the Win+K issue, I've figured it out. I have Windows 7 here, don't even know what charms are.\nKeepass has a \"show keepass\" hotkey (I've set it to Ctrl+Alt+K), but it doesn't act as \"hide\" if Keepass is already active. I wanted a show/hide Keepass hotkey, so I made  Autohotkey listen for Win+K, and then either minimizes Keepass window, or sends Ctrl+Alt+K which shows Keepass. When I press Win+K, Autohotkey sends Ctrl+Alt+K, this happens before I had a chance to release the Win key, so I guess ConEmu thinks both Win and Alt and pressed, and K is pressed then released, and shows it's settings. This theory is confirmed by the following observation: if I press and release Win+K really quickly, the hotkey works properly and settings are not shown. I'm not sure if that can be considered a bug of either Autohotkey or ConEmu, what is your opinion here? If I could disable or change the Win+Alt+K hotkey, though, I could get rid of the problem...\nAs a workaround, I've changed AHK Send ^!k (Ctrl+Alt+K) to\nSend {LWin up}^!k ; Prevent ConEmu thinking Win+Alt+K was pressed.\n. I get your point. But this rare use case justifies having one predefined hotkey for settings. It could also be solved by adding a command-line option. You would then advise that troublesome user to open the Run... dialog and type ConEmu.exe -settings.\nThe other hotkeys that open some particular sections of the settings are convenient if these sections are frequently accessed, but I see no reason why they can't be customized or disabled.\nThere are also other answers to \n. Here's an example. In this case UpdateEx is trying to check for Far updates and Far website is very slow to respond these days.\nThe cursor doesn't change in standalone Far, only under ConEmu. And as far as I remember it also happened in other cases (e.g. doing something in bash). Is it something like \"Program not responding\"? Anyway, to me this behavior is quite irritating.\n\n. Oh, I see. I tried to find it using settings search, but I was searching for \"busy\". My bad.\nSorry.\n. Are you sure this is the problem? In my case the lines being pasted are really short...\nThe page you referenced has a broken link: https://github.com/Maximus5/issues/760\nShould be: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/760\nAlso, it does work without fail in plain cmd.exe (connhost).\n. WC in the one opened via RCtrl+B (arrow keys, backspace not working properly)\nXC in the other one (everything working ok)\nManually switching mode from WC to XC makes the first one work ok. Again, bash opened via RCtrl+B shortcut I'm using.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/is5pfnc1ngoxtxx/conemu-logs.7z?dl=0. Cool, thanks. Waiting for next alpha.\nShould the other two bugs (duplicates) be also closed?. ",

    "ttimm": "From my point of view, the behavior is not correct what I would expect from elevated processeses; an elevated process normal does not require a second elevation. For example, start cmd and type \"start cmd\". You do not get a second elevation prompt. But run the command I gave above and you will get a second elevation prompt.\nWhile it may seem like a security breach, it is not from my point of view in this case. This can only be done if the command is invoked from an elevated process.\nThe idea of running ConEmu itself is more insecure, because I cannot run any unelevated consoles in it if I choose to do this as I explained.\nIt simply is very unpleasant to repeatedly get UAC prompts with no way to suppress them in a controlled way if I want to. I can either run all consoles in elevated mode, which is more harmful, since I cannot have any tabs that have less privileges. I recall that there also is a UAC silent mode in Windows, which disables all UAC elevation prompts, which is a bit extreme, but would get the job done.\nIt simply is a matter of preference to be able to launch elevated consoles without UAC prompting. It would make things more secure to have this ability, because the alternative workarounds make the system less secure.\nFor example, take the Windows Application \"Search Everything\". This program uses the NTFS table to index files very fast, but this requires elevated privileges. In the past, if you added this application to start with Windows, you would cause you to confirm the UAC prompt each boot. A new version now has a button in the options to install a service, which would give the application the required privileges. An UAC prompt would only appear one time when clicking this button to install the service.\nLong story short, I would like to see a way to work with ConEmu without having to run everything elevated. You could consider this a feature request. On the other hand, the behavior for the subprocesses could be considered a bug if you interpret it like I did with different expectations. In this case, you would  not need to work to add any extra features like the developer of \"Search Everything\". I hope this description clarified my intent.\n. I did not think about the process tree from ConEmu's perspective. I guess the command I used just instructs the unelevated process to call a function to request an elevated process. So this may be the problem.\nWhat I am actually doing is a bit more convoluted, so I omitted the description. As I described, my final goal is to create elevated prompts and unelevated prompts in a single instance of ConEmu. I can start an elevated instance of ConEmu without an UAC prompt by just creating a task in taskschds and having it run with highest privileges. But an elevated ConEmu starts all processes as elevated.\nSo my idea was to apply the idea of using the task scheduler method to attach elevated processes to an unelevated ConEmu. This way I could create new unelevated consoles. By invoking my special command, I would create elevated consoles, but would not have to confirm UAC elevation each time. My special script would only have the ability to attach a new elevated console and would not create a security breach, as it is isolated and does not take any parameters.\n. I got an error about the \"/ASYNC\" switch. I suspect this a newer switch? I have installed ConEmu via Chocolatey; it seems the version is a lot older than currently available versions.\nI am seeing some strange behavior, I guess this is due to the missing switch? The tab is not disappearing when I try to close it and nothing happens after this if I type, however the tab disappears when I try to switch to another tab. I will try a new version later.\nWhat I want to achieve is just to run unelevated and elevated tabs in a single ConEmu GUI and I want to be able to create elevated tabs without UAC prompts if I create a new elevated tab. I think your advised solution is probably going to work, but I think I need a newer ConEmu version. I will report back later, but the test without the \"/ASYNC\" switch is already looking promising.\n. I know that you do not maintain the package, I just wanted to explain why my version was older. The version I now downloaded from fosshub is labeled as alpha (there also was one labeled as preview). I believe that this version does not have the problems I described and allows me to do what I want.\nI am still a bit confused about the separation of ConEmu as GUI and ConEmuC as command line tool. The documentation of the command line switches is kind of hard. I just looked, ConEmuC /? does list the existence of the async option as \"/Async\", \"-async yes|no\" in the usage section, but it only lists /AUTOATTACH in the switches section with a mention of the word \"asynchronous\".\nSince I somewhat got what I wanted working, I guess we could close this issue. Alternatively, you could consider if it would be worthwhile to provide a  mechanism for the UAC prompting like \"Search Everything\" provides to facilitate my use case with unelevated and elevated prompts. But I would like to see some better help output.\nAnyway, I like ConEmu very much and want to thank you for your help with this issue.\n. The build from fosshub is labeled as 150316 alpha. As I described, the output mentions /Async, but does not describe what it does. It is also not consistent: \"/Async\" and  \"[-async Y|N]\" is mentioned and you gave \"/ASYNC\" as advice to me. There also is a \" /AUTOATTACH\" in the description that contains the word asynchronous when I search for \"async\".\n. Thank you for clarifying. My main suggestion would be to explicitly list and explain all options. The discussion about the help text kind of deviated from my original problem. I can live with the solution and think that we can probably close the issue.\n. ",

I made some tests: dialogs with 2 and 3 chars wide margins behaves differently (as seen on the pictures in my previous post). BUT the glitch depends on FG of the filename behind the top row of the dialog! I can't see what the logic is in this: some colors causes glitch (independent of the color & 4-bit checkbox) other colors are OK.\nMoreover: where dialogs with 2 chars wide margin causes glitch, 3 chars wide not and vice versa.\nI found another(?) problem(s?) too - screenshots from 160207.

After this feature appeared white text turned gray. I'm unsure in that this option must to be enabled by default. At least this fooled me when I updated my ConEmu months after this feature introduced.\nProposal 2: let add a checkbox \"Use this feature on bitmap backgrounds\", unchecked by default. You force this feature by default but since bitmap hides background color this could leads problems (see above)\nProposal 3: on bitmap-backgrounds calculate an average background color for each character (of course You need to do this only when a new background image used then cache it).\nProposal 4: cast a contrast-shadow around characters - that would be make ANY text readable on ANY background :thumbsup: ( I know the technical difficulties :smiley: )\nOFF-TOPIC: congrats for (the long-time-not-seen) stable releases! :smiley:\n.

ConEmu64.EXE, don't change anything, press OK\n5.) Setting's Storage shows HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\ConEmu.Vanilla\n6.) Set \"Hide caption always\" from OFF to ON\n7.) type EXIT\n8.)

RClick shows System Menu\n14.) GOTO 7\nstep 15: fix bug ;). In ConEmu v.171217 this bug seems to be fixed.\n(hmm... I never saw \"Hide caption always\" greyed out...). In v.171205 this bug was fixed - thank You!\nI using Stardock's ShadowFX wich is a MUST under Windows10 - You can customize shadows under windows. I noticed that, if ConEmu's title hidden, shadow disappears =O\nThis is just a small information for You, it not bugs me as I not hide Title (only when ConEmu is Maximized).\nThis maybe not a bug but a natural side-effect.. In 2017-12-17 this bug still fixed for me.... In 171226 bug re-appeared with a slight difference: this border appeared \"outside\" of a window originally, and then now \"inside\". I had no half-cutted scrollbars (I think it is because of Win10's borderless window).\nAlso \"Frame size\" setting do not sets this border's size. Curiosity: try to set it to -1 and borders gone except at the top (it's a new kind of border \"made from titlebar\") !. In ConEmu v.171217 last settings page now remembered, however not saved when You exit ConEmu. When I testing an issue, would be nice to remember last opened page after re-start ConEmu. Other than this situation it is not a problem.\nThank You for fixing all minor issues I came up with :). In ConEmu v.171217 this bug seems to be fixed! Congratulations !!!. In ConEmu v.171217 bug seems to be fixed! Thank You as always !!!. Nice GIF anim :) How do You did that? (what program is so easy)\nI figured out bug caused by using the same 4-bit border fg/bg color (gray on gray). Regardless of \"TrueMod (24bit color) support\":\n\nUnfortunatelly there are glitches...\n\nSo, I interpreted text \"use both panel edges\" as \"move both panel bottom edges together\". Would be nice a checkbox to able move bottom of panels together or independently (CtrlShiftUp/CtrlShiftDown). I prefer to move independently. Or at least Ctrl+Drag would be independent height resize.\nBut this whole drag-resize is very minor problem, I just created as a record!. Resizing now works well, thanks for Your effort for such a tiny bug!\nUnfortunatelly I need to report another issue :(. Yes, that would be more elegant. I just presumed that user's default needs is to resize both panels by default :) I made vsplit2.cur for resizing at center:\nvsplit2.cur.zip\nBTW I using right panel full height (as a \"main\" panel) and I have a few lines for last command's output below the left panel:\n\n. I having a LUA macro on 'ShiftCtrlUp'/'ShiftCtrlDown' - so independent height resizing calls that macro :(\nIf \"Resize panels by mouse\" is in 3rd state, resizing works \ud83d\udc4d It is possible to make resizing interactive when  'ShiftCtrlUp'/'ShiftCtrlDown' is remapped?\n\nHere is a (hot-spot-)fixed cursor: vsplit2-2018-01-30.cur.zip\n. Please use fixed .cur I posted on Jan. 30\nAfter that I will close this issue :). This happens only if \"Admit monitor dpi with font size\" is checked. I just noticed that icons size depends on TabBar font size too (which is in my specific case is exactly 19px tall).\nIf You want, I can make a few different size variations but then You need to select from them by a few additional lines of code.... @Maximus5: The requested 3 sizes are attached: Win10_toolbar.zip\nCould You use the 38th icon instead of Scroll.bmp please?\nMaybe unneccasary to remark that: do NOT downscale icons! (because of nearest-neighbourhood scale there will be missing columns/rows)\n@aplocher:  I was not intended to make a Win10 theme - I just needed to give a subject for the \"issue\" and then I did referred this as \"Win 10 style\". I created that 19px tall icons just to not to be resized by that fucking stupid Windows.\nThanks to Your critisism I modified skin a bit. (however I will never make Scroll icon B&W - this Win10 styling is so boring... ). This was tricky to save but works finally: search.bmp.zip. Instead of SVG support I strongly suggest a checkbox: \"Disable fine resizing toolbar icons\"\nFor this checkbox I magnified missing 2 variations of original icons. I hope original author will create 21px & 28px variants... (until that, magnified versions are OK).\nPrevious indexed-color Win10 icons are re-saved in ARGB (tested even on XP)\nI modified the attached zip in the original post to reflect these changes/additions.\n@Maximus5: if somebody edit a post, do You informed about that automatically?. OK, works well now.. As of 180206 this little bug is fixed - Maximus5 You are a quite precise man/woman.\nHowever I consider showing Min/Max/Restore always - who wants a window without these buttons? (apart from full-screen games & a very few pervert \"hyper-power users\")\nI can't express how I admire You/your work on ConEmu.... Sorry Maximus5, I did transformed this issue into another one as I realised that original issue was wrong.\nIf You follow my instructions You will face the bug presents in 180131.. Not related to invisible titlebar:\n@lowtrucks: on both of Your screenshots there are a 4px tall area at the bottom. On 2nd screenshot I see FAR is maximized - what is that dirt at the bottom then?\nPlease tell me how do You made these screenshots? (do You edited a fullscreen screenshot and accidentally crop them 4px larger at the bottom?)\nI having a problem for a few weeks now: c.a. once a day ConEmu is shortened by 4px at the bottom when maximized. All running ConEmu instances get shortened when once this happens (!) Problem still exist when I restart ConEmu instances (!). I need to sign-out to kill this bug (!).\nSo, can You tell a tale about this bottom area? Is it there right after boot? \nP.S.: ...I working on Windows 10. Hm... When I make a screenshot with Alt-PrintScreen there are no additional dirt at the bottom.\nI mean \"dirt\" as the bottom 4 lines of Your screenshots.. ...yes, Alt-PrintScreen copies this space instead of the underlying app :T \"nice\"\nOn Win7 & 10 that space is 2px only.. @Maximus5: ALT+Printscreen copies only the active window to clipboard, so don't except a TaskBar.\nlowtrucks attached screenshots are 1056 px tall (1080-24), so I also don't think that extra dirt is because of Auto-hiding TaskBar.\n@lowtrucks: could You send 2 Printscreen snapshots (without ALT pressing) one with TaskBar at the bottom and another one with TaskBar at the left? Many thanks!. @lowtrucks: Thanks! Now I see that better to report maximized window screenshots by plain PrintScreen instead of Alt-PrintScreen.. Seems to be fixed - do You commented out calling of this dialog? :wink:\nMaximus5: I have a button here on GitHub \"Close and comment\" - for such a simple issue like this, do I need to push that or better to leave closing task for You?. Man, I managed to reproduce this issue!!! :thumbsup:\nSo I simplified/modified original post, please re-read it! If You can't reproduce it then I send You the logs & screenshots of course.\nNow I'm sure You can fix this bug (I played with it by weeks now to narrow down problem source... I'm so happy now!). No, I had not!\nHowever if bug presents and I set TaskBar to autohidden at left side then right side also shortened (!).\nI think better to fix 1448 and then I send You logs/screenshots.\nRemark: I wrote that edge shortened by 3 pixels which is 4 pixels really (we see 3 px desktop background + 1 px border of ConEmu's window). I think You know that You must download PNG to examine pixel-perfect.\nAlso I noticed that I used 125% custom DPI - if You using 100% then 4px becomes 2px only!\nAre You sure in that You examined display close enough? Best to make a full-screen screenshot and examine it in an editor. For quicker checks I using https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit with Ctrl-Alt-Z as hotkey.. I found another easy way to reproduce issue:\n\n...and log files with screen recording \u2190 here\nThis shrinking is annoying because I using Taskbar at left side and I fine-tuned Statusbar's font size to eliminate any border in a maximized ConEmu.\nLooking nice:\n\nNot nice:\n\n. It is actual :cry: Gap between FAR's panel and statusbar caused by shortened ConEmu window. Happens few times per day randomly but You can reproduce as seen on following fullscreen recording (MUST hide window caption):\n\nI can't reproduce #1170. Part I: I set (left-side) Taskbar to auto-hidden only during recording. Auto-hidden Taskbar on/off not influences this issue (my post on  2018 Mar 21 shows a (bottom) Taskbar with -basic switch).\nPart II: seems ConEmu is over the hidden Taskbar, maybe I will make another report about that. But if You want I can inspect this right now.. @Maximus5: see #1539 for answer. Release notes of 180503 says \"Maximized ConEmu was not sized properly after display changes.\"\nI was so :), but seems that fix is not for this issue :(\nBTW many thanks for Your incredible amount of work on ConEmu!.

Windows XP+ allows remapping of physical keys in the registry, so I remapped some unnecessary keys. An easy-to-use utility for this is SharpKeys. For example, You able to disable the fucking Win-key(!) - if it were You. Muha-ha-ha :laughing: However You can create Win and App (Menu) keys by remapping right Alt and/or Ctrl.\nA much more powerful and complex utility is Autohotkey. It is mainly for create macro-keys but it even can remap keys on a per-app basis or simulate mouse actions.\nI using both of them.. On the \"Keys & Macro\" page You can define shortcuts to 32 GuiMacros - see \"Type\" column with value \"Macro 01\" - \"Macro 32\". There are definite GuiMacros to control window.\n. if (bit64.band(Mouse.Button, 1) == 1) works without ConEmu. Do You think the problem is in FAR?\nI really like if this line of code could work with ConEmu too...\nAlso, don't You think this NUMLOCK-bit is a bit strange?\nOf course, these macros have demonstration purposes only, msgbox (\"my_function\") replaced by an useful function (Ctrl-Shift-Left/Right shows content of highlighted file/folder on passive panel, Ctrl-Shift-Up/Down moves highlighted line and update content on passive panel as well). ### Enhancements\n- Add option 'Menu' to \"Mouse/Mouse button actions/Right\" (This way copy/paste mechanism can work as in Windows usually and as CottonEaster likes). Perhaps add two options: \"Shift-menu\", \"Ctrl-menu\" (as ConEmu having two menus)\n\n\nAdd a modifier key drop-down-menu to \"Intelligent mode\": I'm smart enough to remember what \"Intelligent mode\" means but stupid enough to remember so many modifiers, so I like to uncheck stream/block modifier checkboxes and use only 1 modifier with \"Intelligent mode\". I feel should open an issue for this (?)\n\n\nAdd description for \"Intelligent mode\":\n\n\nHold left mouse button then start moving horizontally for stream selection (like GUI text editors)\n\nHold left mouse button then start moving vertically for rectangular selection\n\nTypo\n\n\nRename \"Mark/Copy\"/\"Text selection\" checkbox to \"Stream selection\"\n\n\nRename checkbox to \"Start selection with Shift+Arrow (Stream = Left/Right/Home/End; Block = Up/Down)\"\n\n\nRename description to \"Enable stream selection (like GUI text editors)\". > \"Personally I see mo sense in copy/paste menu\"\n\n\nIf this aimed to me, I did'n talked about a separated \"copy/paste menu\" - I wanted to refer to the existing menus.\nMeanwhile I realized that user can set plain RClick on \"Keys & Macro\" page for this effect. @CottonEaster: this is the solution for You!\n\nRClick intelligent mode is unique in ConEmu which is answer to inability to do things properly in other terminals.\n\nUhhh - I absolutely not understand You :confused: ...or You did misunderstood some of my words :smile:\n\n\"Stream\" selection was renamed to \"Text\" selection intentionally.\n\n\"Text-selection\" terminology is OK but then correct \"stream selection\" in StatusBar! :P. No, I mean \"selecting text\" in the \"user area\" (command-line part of FAR). There are fragments of commands I typed and fragments of output of commands.\nThe main thing is that intelligent-mode unavailable for ALL programs that using mouse (this is the reason I changed title 1 min after issue created).. Ahhh! You are right! ConEmu's FAR plugin works with Intelligent mode intelligently \ud83d\ude04. Worst Feature Award Winner! :(\nMy Windows startup script starts FAR in a ConEmu window, other 3 programs in other ConEmu window, 4 logging programs in yet another ConEmu window and a single app in another ConEmu.\nNow I get these errors twice in a minute:\n\"Can't open file for writing!\nC:\\Prg\\Windows\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.xml\nErrCode=0x00000020\"\nor\n\"Failed to write configuration file, Code=32\nC:\\Prg\\Windows\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.xml\"\nSeems ConEmu instances wants to write to the same ConEmu.xml file in the same time.\nAdditionally please make a checkbox for poor users dislike to save 4*180k to SSD in every minutes! Or optimize things and save only when specific parameters/tasks are changed.\n(temporarily I inserted pauses between ConEmu windows starts to eliminate concurrency). @Boscop: modify Sleep mode to Hybrid sleep or Hibernate! Hybrid sleep saves RAM to disk, so if battery runs out, RAM will be loaded from disk, otherwise works like normal Sleep.. Ohh - unfortunately after a Sleep ConEmu instances synchronized together :laughing:. Thanks Maximus5, I turned off \"Auto save window size/pos on exit\" and everything is :ok_hand:. Yes, my description is bug-free :)\nHowever when \"Appearance/Scrollbar/Auto\" selected, \"scrollbar not appears\"\n...or it appears for You?. Sorry, I interpreted \"Auto\" as \"Auto appears when hover mouse\" basically\nConEmu -basic -run cmd\n\n. I deleted my last comment.\nI figured out that scrollbar show/hide depends on number of lines printed in a whole (or a rapid row). I made an utility for testing: Print_some_lines.zip Under 400 lines usually scrollbar not appears and over 700 usually appears.\nFollowing screen recording shows this behavior, plus that mouse hover not works (even when many lines are printed to console) after v180415:\n\n. So, the mouse-hover part of Auto Scrollbar works again - thanks!\nI close this issue, however a command output less than 400 lines usually not brings in Scrollbar, more than 700 usually works well - I don't care :). True :) Thanks for enlighten me!. Issue seems to be fixed :)\nMinor: ConEmu's window edge (as in case of every other app) is under the Taskbar if it is Maximized and Taskbar autohidden:\n\nIf You have the power to control a Maximized window's size/position then please take into account auto-hidden Taskbar's 2 pixels size!\nTo be honest, I was the user who tell You Maximus5 about this 2 pixels of auto-hidden Taskbar on Google Code, and as I remember You fixed something with it... (?). ...and sorry this issue is dupe of my issue #1448 :(. Hmmm - GitHub seems fucked up pictures, so You need to download to see them pixel-perfect.\nIt is 2 pixels here - I loaded a screenshot into Photoshop, zoomed in well to grid appear, then made a screenshot of Photoshop:\n\n. Using native resolution (100% DPI/font scaling):\nForeground: x00080CD6 {1,0}-{2560,1440} 'VirtualConsoleClass' - {\\\\Server\\Shared} - Far\nDisplay: bpp=32, planes=1, align=1, vrefr=59, shade=x00000000, rast=x00007E99, dpi=96x96, per-mon-dpi=1\nMonitors (dpi: WholeDesktop, Effective, Angular, RAW):\n  00010001: {0,0}-{2560,1440} (2560x1440), Working: {0,0}-{2560,1440} (2560x1440), dpi: {96,96};{96,96};{108,108};{108,108} `\\\\.\\DISPLAY1` <<== Primary\nI tried 1024*768 and Taskbar-at-bottom, hidden Taskbar is always 2 pixels.\nI have a powerful nVidia graphics card =).

I din't said that ConEmu differs from any other programs.\nI don't mind how many pixels Your Taskbar occupies (on all your screenshots Taskbar is 2 pixels)\nIf we report this 'bug' to Microsoft they will mention to buy a 4K monitor and error will be much negligible :laughing:. Mr. Maximus5, You won the \"Everi Pixelz Countz\" award!\n:trophy:\nCongratulations!\nVery nice!. Because a practical reason: slow to reach this new function through a sub-menu.\nMenu item \"Open in editor\" right under \"Edit\" just accelerates this function, I think it is more important that a super-orthodox philosophy which can't accept exceptions over usability. We are (so, at least I'm) not robots, we have exceptions even in our language (!) too.\nMoreover I don't want to EDIT contents, I just like to VIEW (browse/search) it in my editor. All menu items under Edit is related to select/copy/paste mechanism and \"Open in editor\" is a distinct function which takes shit on all selections and all related functions. Instead open contents in another view (through an external app). Further select/copy/paste will made in THAT editor, IF any.\nPerhaps You can interpret this function as a separated one as this not copy/paste/select text BUT \"open contents in an external editor\" - there is no any \"EDIT\".\nAs I described this whole procedure is executable with half-dozen clicks but target would be a one-click solution.\nWhat's Your PRACTICAL reason to force this menu item into a sub-menu? (no THEORY, practical reason please!) Main r-click menu is not too long, a new menu-item easily fit in it.\nAs usual, thank You for ConEmu!. \"Man, it's terminal, use keyboard\" - You are cruel :) I developing interactive/multimedia apps, so a mouse is permanently fixed to my right hand.\n\nNavigating in sub-menus IS PAINFUL!\nremembering yet another 1-2-modifier key + shortcut are also painful\nkeyboard/mouse interactions are exactly the same number of button presses in this case (namely 3)\n\nWhy the mouse-menu in general, when You can activate all it's functions via keyboard? I hope You still support mouse in the future...\nSeems I never will achieve a root menu item, even after I described why this function DOES NOT FIT in the Edit group - it's a separated function which is NOT related to text selection/editing. Is a different VIEW of the content, You open content in a different app, like Windows \"Open with\" - what the Earth connect this function to the existing Edit functions? There is even no word about \"Clipboard\". This is like \"Open with\" in Windows...\nReally sorry if You can't accept/understand this.\n\"Every user has their own preferences and the Menu root level can't hold all requested items.\" - and it's opposite also true: \"Every user has their own preferences and the sub-menus can't hide all their items (mostly if that item is NOT belongs to there).\". Mapped logical network drives / subst drives visibility depends on elevated/non-elevated creation in Windows 10 (as I experienced).\nFor example: I create my S: drive at elevated FAR start and using S: only in FAR. File explorer (and hopefully ransomware) can't see S:\nSo, try to start ConEmu with/without elevated!. @d1letant \"Any other ideas?\" - seems You didn't understood me... Your admin created mapping without elevated, so You will NOT see that drive in elevated ConEmu (and anything You start from ConEmu)\nAs I already wrote, start ConEmu non-elevated and You will see Your admin-mapped drives!\nOr ask Your admin to create net mapping from an elevated Task too, which started at every login (then drives will be visible for both elevated and non-elevated apps)\nAlso I already wrote  that this is a Windows10+ \"feature\". I used ConEmu/FAR for years and when I switched to Windows10 I played quite time to make things work...\nOnce more: subst/mapings created from an elevated prompt seen only for elevated programs (so those are invisible for plain File Explorer or other apps). Subst/mapings created from an non-elevated prompt seen only in non-elevated programs (like plain File Explorer or regular apps but unseen for Your elevated ConEmu/FAR)\nYou also can put a line in Settings/Startup/Environment in ConEmu:\nnet use S: \\\\server\\shared. \"Environment page supports only limited set of commands,...\" - the way to enhance ;). What program shows this code \"93\"?\nOn a traditional keyboard here is a key labeled with a \"Menu\" icon, that is for pop-up right-click menu in Wondows.\nThe standard calls it \"App\" key which IS usable in ConEmu.. On a Windows 10 1809 LTSC here is no \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor.\" (HKLM-variant is presents). When I add the missing \"Command Processor\" key then \"Register ConEmu autorun\" works.\nBut \"Force new ConEmu window\" not works - new cmd.exe opened in a new tab.. For me, it's works. Attach that noisy_net.png!. I tried \"exactly\" your commandline and it works.\nTry ConEmu -basic then enable background image:\n\nIf that works then something with Your config is wrong. Set \"Replace color indexes\" to \"*\" or \"#0\" or...\nRecently I cleared my .cfg file becouse something fucked up in it during the years and adjusted all settings step-by-step manually.. For me, this Startup/Tasks/{Logs} works well (see empty lines between each command):\nc:\\my\\src\\terminal\\terminal /p /l burner.log -new_console:W:\"T:\\noisy_net.png\"\nc:\\my\\src\\terminal\\terminal /p /l rss.log  -new_console:W:\"T:\\ipon.png\"\nc:\\my\\src\\terminal\\terminal /p /l playlist.log\nc:\\my\\src\\terminal\\terminal /p upload.log. Yes, solved if You notice that red circle on the image I attached :)\nYou can close this issue then.. @plashenkov: \"Mouse wheel doesn't work in Far ... by default\" - it works for me. With or without BufferHeight. Don't forget to enable \"Send mouse events to console\" checkbox!\nTry ConeEmu.exe -basic\nSee this issue. I modified the steps...\nHappy New Year!. @Alexound: try ConEmu64.exe -basic -run powershell:\n\nSo, if You get unwrapped text instead of like on this picture then start to play with Your ConEmu settings.\nConEmu gets text content from the original console (named \"Real console\" which is hidden by default - use Ctrl+Right mouse button and select \"Debug/Real console\" to see it)\nWould be wise to using latest ConEmu and filling asked questions (like Your OS, etc.) at posting.... @KuraiAndras You wrote that You using 190108 but on the screenshot version is 180626.\nFor me both versions works well (try ConEmu64.exe -basic). @ysc3839: You can copy graphics from behind ConEmu, tint it with a color then use it as background bitmap - this works however is a resource hog (in theory).\nPerhaps would be an easier option to use background of Windows only for \"graphics from behind ConEmu\" (?). @farzadmf : use AutoHotkey to remap your key-combo shortcuts per/application!\nSomehow like this (not tested):\n```\nIfWinActive ahk_class VirtualConsoleClass\nF1::   sendinput ^+{tab}\nF2::   sendinput ^{tab}\n\nifWinActive\n``.

And ClearType settings is enabled.\nIs that enough to convince @Maximus5  ? :)\n. @Maximus5 can you also comment on the font sizes discrepancy?\n. @Maximus5 , sorry if it sounded like a complain. I am just curios.\nFor both checked and unchecked they look significantly smaller than in Visual Studio or Sublime, which makes me think that your way to calculate size is not consistent with them\n\n\n. P.S. And Admit monitor dpi with font size makes no difference\n. Lodged a separate feature request #481 to address font size selector\n. BTW, I raised a question for DirectWrite on Source Code Pro repo https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/issues/116 and they advised to use TTF font instead of OTF. Now ConEmu looks great without DirectWrite\n. ",
    "JoeUX": "Hi all, I just saw this and wanted to note that DirectWrite and ClearType are not alternatives to each other. DirectWrite uses ClearType, and includes a lot of other features like OpenType typography, so it would never be one vs. the other. The choice is DirectWrite vs. GDI. This article is decent.\nI'd love to see DirectWrite in ConEmu. Note that it's a bit of a moving target, as more features, APIs, and performance boosts are implemented with every major Windows release. I remember that Windows 8 saw a big bump in font rendering performance. DirectWrite is part of Direct2D, and new versions of 2D sometimes get backported to Windows 7.\n. ",

",
    "mqudsi": "Please note that sharing screenshots is useless for clarity comparisons, and only indicative of font kerning and glyph support.\nClearType/Direct2D/DirectWrite optimize the placement of pixels for your display so naturally it makes no sense to expect output that's been customized for your display to accurately represent what you see when a screenshot of that is viewed on another person's system..

Solution found by way of Andre Neves (http://superuser.com/a/1091991/16966), who reported the issue with ConEmu 160619 [64]. I'm using 160612 [32], and here's my keyboard settings:\n\n. I'm not sure about the 'resize with arrows' part you quoted Maximus, but for me I have to click ConEmu systray icon every time I logon to Windows in order to regain Aero Snap hotkeys.  \nAlso, on this 1st systray click, when ConEmu opens but there is no command prompt. I close the window, Aero Snap works. I run ConEmu again (from start menu, because systray icon is gone), command prompt is available, and Aero Snap still works.\n\n. Something strange here. In the screenshot from systray-click that I just uploaded ConEmu is v160612 [32], but the entry in Control Panel >> Add/Remove Programs is 161206x64.\n\n...Running ConEmu from Start Menu is the newer x64. Running ConEmu by  \"Start >> Command Prompt\" shows the older 32bit ConEmu. So I have it installed twice somehow. \nFrom newer x64 ConEmu under Settings>> Integration>> Default term I set \"Force ConEmu as default terminal for console applications\" and 'Register with OS on startup\". Now after a fresh login Aero Snap works and opening Command Prompt shows x64 ConEmu shell. There is no systray icon anymore but that's okay because I didn't really use it anyway.\n\n. ",

Yes, it's quite clear for me that I should have ConEmu plugin to make ConEmu Features to work. And I have them, attached image shows it. And I use thumbnails panel mode from time to time. But I can't figure out, why I can't see \"FAR windows\" option working.\n\n. F*cking shit! Just made it working. The problem lies in installation. When I install ConEmu for the first time on any station, I use installer package - to create icons and app uninstall entry. And all other consequent upgrades are made from archived version with plain unzip command. This leads me to the situation, where I have two copies of ConEmu FAR plugin under Plugins directory. First one installed with installer package to  the Plugin directory without ConEmu subfolder. And with unzip command I created ConEmu directory with newer ConEmu plugin. I do not know which one has got loaded, but I think they disturb each other.\nYou should think to correct paths in installer package so they correspond to archived version,\nProblem solved, thanks for pointing to the plugin.\n.

    "OregonGhost": "I'm not sure if that is the same, because you write that the debugger in VS has changed and ConEmu has not yet been adapted. But 140707 works fine, so it seems it's actually a regression in ConEmu.\nI'm not sure where I'd start to debug that thing (just cloned the code and built the latest version), though I'd like to help you with this, because I'd really like to use a newer version because of all the other goodies :)\n. I'm not sure if this is the same, because the behaviour is very different from #96. It seems that the process msvsmon.exe is not yet fully started (it has only 120KB memory allocated at that point, a moment later it has like 10MB or more), but I'm not sure if that's just the way ConEmu works.\nAfter your call to CreateToolhelp32Snapshot (which returns an invalid handle, making you return CIR_SnapshotCantBeOpened, aka -113), I called GetLastError(), and that returns ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY (\"Only part of a ReadProcessMemory or WriteProcessMemory request was completed.\"). This can mean that the process was gone, or (from documentation) can also mean that the caller is 32-bit, while the target is 64-bit. However, the ConEmu process that produces this error is a ConEmuC64.exe, so this is likely not the reason, and the process is just starting up, so it's not actually gone. Maybe this information helps you?\n. ",
    "cobrabr": "I have the same problem, and not just with VS (running the latest alpha version, 150722 as of this post).

I don't have any exact steps -- it's very random. I can send you my ConEmu.xml for the settings, however.\n. OS: Win 7 x64\nUser: Admin, no UAC\nConfig:\n\nFor the details, I'll go to Process Explorer once the issue pops up again (ProcExp is always running in the background anyway :smile:). And I'll see about grabbing the memory dumps as well.\nAs you can see in the screenshot, I had Aggresive Mode enabled, but I have just disabled it. I'll keep you posted.\n. I haven't seen this particular issue come up, but every time I upgrade ConEmu, every hooked executable that I have open crashes. Turning off Aggressive Mode seems to have helped with the original issue, though...\n. Setting the coordinates when quake mode is on doesn't work properly -- if you try to move it to a second monitor by setting the X coordinate to a value larger than the width of the monitor (which is what happens when you move it with the mouse) it changes the value to the largest possible value within the first monitor. Doing so when quake mode is off works perfectly.\nThe same is true for moving the window with the Win Keys -- it works with quake mode off, doesn't work when it's on.\n. It seems to have improved, but I still get some occasional crashes in Windows Explorer. There is no error message, though; Windows Explorer simply says it crashed, closes and restarts.\nI'll keep an eye out for further specifics, if I can, but I think this can be considered fixed.\n. I've been having a crashing issue that might be related to this one: whenever ConEmu updates, every process that I have listed under the \"List of hooked executables\" crashes and restarts, including Windows Explorer. \nHere is the Event Viewer entry for the latest crash I've experienced just now, updating ConEmu to version 160313:\nError:\nFaulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 6.1.7601.17567, time stamp: 0x4d672ee4\nFaulting module name: ConEmuHk64.160310.dll_unloaded, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x56e1ee28\nException code: 0xc0000005\nFault offset: 0x000000007e16b62c\nFaulting process id: 0x13a8\nFaulting application start time: 0x01d17df7f5fb16b1\nFaulting application path: C:\\WINDOWS\\explorer.exe\nFaulting module path: ConEmuHk64.160310.dll\nReport Id: 13898f33-e9f7-11e5-abd2-7427eabe1032\nEvent Data:\nexplorer.exe \n6.1.7601.17567 \n4d672ee4 \nConEmuHk64.160310.dll_unloaded \n0.0.0.0 \n56e1ee28 \nc0000005 \n000000007e16b62c \n13a8 \n01d17df7f5fb16b1 \nC:\\WINDOWS\\explorer.exe \nConEmuHk64.160310.dll \n13898f33-e9f7-11e5-abd2-7427eabe1032\nI can open a new issue for this one if they're not related.\n. Any idea about this last one, @Maximus5?\n. The log files and the XML config can be found here.\nFYI, for the first run with the logs, I opened, disabled Quake-style slide down, moved to the second monitor and then closed, just in case you see extra stuff there in the log. :)\nLet me know if you need anything else.\n. For me (as the screenshot shows), the values that reset aren't negative -- in fact, I'm pretty sure Y remains at -3 (that value is negative in this case because of the Quake-style slide down, I believe).\nBut like @claw0 said, it used to work in the past -- I've had my ConEmu on my second monitor since the first day of using it, and it always saved the position properly.\n. Just tested it, works fine. Thanks, @Maximus5! :+1: \n. The steps described by @AndreKR are exactly what I'm experiencing right now. If it helps, I'm running Win10 x64.. There you go: ConEmu_xml.zip\nMulti.LeaveOnClose is set to 00, if that's what you're wondering... \ud83d\ude09 It's what ConEmu itself saves, when I check that particular checkbox. When I uncheck it and then save, the value in the XML changes to 02.\n. It also moves the window to the right (by about 50px on my screen) and the right-hand border cuts the red \"X\" on the top right.. ",

What I am saying is that this was originally a feature of DOSKEY but these features were later integrated into cmd itself.\n. @bbottema, no idea. Generally speaking, keypresses that aren't first handled by ConEmu get passed to the console window host, so whatever hotkeys cmd supports are also supported by ConEmu.. There's a file in the ConEmu install folder called CmdInit.cmd or something along those lines - it sets the prompt. All you need to do is remove the part that retrieves includes the computer name.\n.

Yes, CNet, ZDNet et al. have talked about it (you make it sound as if CNN needs to cover this too), but another criteria that makes 7-Zip notable is its historical value. It is a 16-year-old graphical file archiver made by the same person who made the 7z file format and the LZMA compression algorithm. It is notable because it is a clear open-source competitor to RAR.\nHowever, one thing that ticks me off about Wikipedia is how admins often override voting (ex. everyone can say \"no\" in a close discussion and the admin will say \"yes\" and delete it anyway), and how deleted articles cannot be recovered. Instead you have to go in there right before it's deleted, salvage the article, and bring it back to userspace.\n. CE looks stable enough to me.\n. Many thanks.\n.

So the entire file will look like:\nrH5/CoweD6V9936O/TuuxQskDT6YTg/Cllww0yC/Y2hjMjtwSGtPUhhLKV+QyiXGv7H5yeBmNTmE2GsoqxD6jMaDAp/WOhvZATmX31FuouKRqLiGNTy3UTr21Vu4xJHkro3NTFQfQuu430JXAIvmRV5uLN\n...\nF1AY1iAiDCHYrQ0zFYB97pQPf5Bl31huAmP2IktYNPRcqeuw4idL/af+1ntvvQ4PBYY6pjG0YmOhp8IU8/yJFOaJxS1OcmiBd/spoAp+N3tdV7VWnHxBn9/JgwjBrghwot152Wpkvw2M0gBfboAVHKHV/14zeA4u+IlxzPrv\nYou could encrypt just parts of the XML file to satisfy my needs, but that seems like more work. \nI would propose doing the encryption with a customizable symmetric key (passphrase).\nThanks,\nEWG\n. That certainly works for me. To provide an example:\n<key name=\"Task1\" Encrypted=\"True\" modified=\"2015-04-13 20:02:54\" build=\"150409\">\n    rH5/CoweD6V9936O/TuuxQskDT6YTg/Cllww0yC/Y2hjMjtwSGtPUhhLKV+QyiXGv7H5yeBmNTmE2Gsoq\n</key>\n. I originally opened this two years ago. However, even if this was implemented now, I doubt I would use it. I no longer like the idea of stored sensitive data in an encrypted config file. I prefer the config file to be clean and access sensitive data through another means.\nThe way I am doing things now is, ConEmu calls a script, which runs and does things such as:\n- prompt for a passphrase and use that to access a credential management API\n- use that credential to run a new process (e.g. PowerShell) and add that process into ConEmu as a new tab\nIt seems that other people are interested in this, so I'll leave it up to you to keep open or close. However, it's good to close by me.. @admsteck I think you just want to use built in Windows functionality to move a window. If you press the \"windows\" key and use the arrow keys, you can move any app around.\n. win+arrow works for me when ConEmu is in quake mode. I'm thinking that I may have removed a ConEmu macro that was bound the win+arrow to get that working. Also, I'm on Win 10 in case that's relevant.\n. I deal with this all the time and it's because of an issue with PSReadline (https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/issues/77). You can run \"rmo psreadline\" to disable that extension and I bet this issue no longer occurs for you. This is not an issue with ConEmu, you can verify that by opening normally PowerShell and confirming it has the same behavior. \nMy solution is to have two ConEmu tabs open all the time. One with PSReadline and one without it.\n-EWG\n. In case this helps, in one of the newer versions of ConEmu, I wasn't getting the default AppKeys settings for a new custom task. I changed my custom task to include -new_console:p5 and that fixed it for me. See \nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html for p[N] - pty modes meaning.. Thanks so much, -reuse is what I was looking for!\n. Thank you Maximus. Sorry about the confusing screenshot, I have updated it to show the .ico file instead of the png file, but the result is the same. \nI did read the manual but didn't notice that it's capital C, I was using a lower case C. With that change in place, I am working. \nThanks for setting me straight!\n. Thanks for setting me straight!\n. I'm seeing that 1.12.2-rc1 fixes things for arrow keys in bash. However, it still seems to be broken when I use vi or nano. \n. Sorry, I should have said Docker 1.12.2-rc1, https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.12.2. \n. Thanks Maximus5, however, I cannot reproduce this issue running just VIM in PowerShell. Is there a good way I can verify whether this is a VIM or ConEmu issue?\n. Here's a demo of the same thing in native PowerShell as best I can try to match the window and font sizes.\n\n. I'd prefer a command line option if possible. I use a CMDB file to store a list of hundreds of servers that I ssh into via Putty. I have a PowerShell profile script that queries the CMDB file and dynamically creates PowerShell functions with the names of the servers. This lets me type in the name of a server, hit enter, and have it open a new ConEmu tab running Putty and connected to the server. \nI'd like to also be able to take groups of servers and open multiple Putty connections to each of them, but have them in a grid with splits.\nIn case this helps at all, I would be happy with just being able to know the current count of tabs. That would let me do this by creating the tab with splits at the end of the tab list.. The third example under \"fails\" is using double quotes, but it still fails. ```\n\nSetup\n\nmkdir \"C:\\temp\\icons\"\nmkdir \"C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\"\ninvoke-webrequest \"https://github.com/favicon.ico\" -outfile \"C:\\temp\\icons\\favicon.ico\"\ninvoke-webrequest \"https://github.com/favicon.ico\" -outfile \"C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\\favicon.ico\"\ndir \"C:\\temp\\icons\"\ndir \"C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\"\n\nTesting\n\nWorks as expected\n& ConEmu.exe -reuse -cmd powershell -new_console:C:C:\\temp\\icons\\favicon.ico\n& ConEmu.exe -reuse -cmd powershell -new_console:C:'C:\\temp\\icons\\favicon.ico'\n& ConEmu.exe -reuse -cmd powershell -new_console:C:\"C:\\temp\\icons\\favicon.ico\"\nFails\n& ConEmu.exe -reuse -cmd powershell -new_console:C:C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\\favicon.ico\n& ConEmu.exe -reuse -cmd powershell -new_console:C:'C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\\favicon.ico'\n& ConEmu.exe -reuse -cmd powershell -new_console:C:\"C:\\temp\\icons with spaces\\favicon.ico\"\n\nError\n\nC:C:\\temp\\icons : The term 'C:C:\\temp\\icons' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function,\nscript file, or operable program.

Thanks, I appreciate the help understanding this. \n-EWG. I've noticed that bash is slower to start and slower to run things when using the wslbridge. If I run bash without wslbridge in ConEmu, I don't see that slowness (but there are other issues of course). I put an exception in Windows Defender and that cut down my delay by about half, but it's still enough that it's noticable. Should this get opened as an issue at https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge?. I just tried wslbridge without ConEmu. It opens fast and I see no delays running things. So that is a good data point.. I just tried both of them, neither show delays.. I'm seeing no noticeable delay with minimal testing.. I tried all ConEmu versions over the last six months. The issue started on version\n171203. It is not present in version 171117 or earlier. \n. In case it's helpful, I updated to 180108, but did not see a change in behavior. . I've noticed this on 171217 as well (didn't notice it on previous builds). It happens infrequently and goes away with a window refresh. I don't have reliable steps to reproduce it. Definitely not a big deal to me.. Agreed, I'm still seeing the issue after update.\n\n. I am testing with \"ConEmu64.exe -log -basic -run {cmd}\" - will follow up\nI don't run ConEmu maximized.\nHere's a video of it.\n\n. In this case, I just hovered to reveal the aero peek. However, I usually see this issue just after opening ConEmu for the first time or after minimizing some other large window that was covering ConEmu. \nSo far I haven't seen the issue with \"-log -basic\", but assuming I do, I'll upload the logs.. While using \"-log -basic\" I opened a new tab with putty and got this:\n\nAttached are the logs:\nlogs.zip\n. Still seeing the issue:\n\nSometimes it's worse now where the title bar is completely gone and nothing is showing main window:\n\nI don't run ConEmu maximized, but I do generally run it covering about 80% of my screen space. If I make the window very small (better for screenshots) I have been unable to reproduce the issue.. In this version and the last, I am able to reliably reproduce this issue\n\n. logs-title-bar.zip contains logs and screenshots\n. I've been running this for about five hours and it's looking fixed on my machine.\nThere is one very minor thing I've noticed and it's that I see a small \"jitter\" after bringing a Putty window to focus. I don't see the jitter bringing other native console windows to focus. After the window settles, I don't see the jitter. \n\nI personally would not consider this a bug and do not see any need to work on fixing it.. I think this is the same as https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1369. logs-hotkeys.zip contains logs and screenshot\n. I'm no longer seeing this issue in 180114. Update: I've removed my comment about shift-up/down not letting you get the full width of the page. I now understand that if you start the selection with the mouse (as Maximus5 suggested) you can start anywhere on the screen. \nOlder versions of ConEmu would let you \"copy and scroll\" quickly so I'm still hoping that we can get that back. .

    "znamenap": "Hi, \nCan you confirm wherther this scenario is doable and a good compromise to encrypted XML element values? Would you be kind to me and include the below scenario on your TODO list? Should I specify it in different issue? Is there any alternative how to perform the scenario withou a code change? Thank you for soon reply.\nThis actually relates to my feature request which I didn't raised and was just about to do when I saw this issue. In my opinion an alternative way can be the following scenario to be added to ConEmu features:\nScenario: I'm being asked for password via credentials dialog while ConEmu is triggering a task\nGiven I've to run a console app (i.e. PowerShell) using different credentials (while being in corporate or enterprise)\nAnd I set up a new console settings in tasks in ConEmu settings\nAnd I entered just the user name (i.e INTRANET\\znamenap_aps my different Windows account) \nAnd dialog validation recognised I want to be asked for password when task launches\nAnd I saved settings and closed settings dialog\nWhen I start the newly set console \nAnd ConEmu determined I want to be asked for credentials\nAnd ConEmu shows me credentials dialog with prefilled username and leave password blank for me\nAnd I enter credentials (i.e. password) in the dialog\nAnd I confirmed the credential details\nThen ConEmu creates new Windows identity credential token (usable for network access)\nAnd ConEmu uses it to start the new console (aka runas)\nThen attaches to the newly started console \nAnd host the UI among the other tabs.\nReasons for this feature:\n- We're forced to change password frequently, and three bad attempts to login with old password being stored somewhere in settings actaully immeadeatly locks the account.\n- Storing plain passwords in configuration file is bad security practice although you can set up encryption of the settings file by NTFS feature (file properties, advanced tab). This is still dangerous if sombody hacked your password and logged in with your credentials and observed the settings file.\nNote: Re, encrypting XML element content. I'm not sure which language is used whether it is C# or C++, however, .NET has ability to encrypt such configuration keys and handles encryption decryption transparently at API level, so the API user does not notice considerable change. Nevertheless, it is limited to the actual machine, if you moved such settings file with encrypted XML element to a different machine  than the API will decrypt the values, but provide incorrect values. Moreover, it adds risk on what hack the value is there when you need to figure out the password, because you forget it.\nCheers!\nPavel\n. ",
    "littlemissgoth": "Shuffling the command-line around has worked, thanks.\nMight I suggest that (especially given the previous behaviour), it might be a good idea to make the error message a little bit more informative... even if its just to either reference the page you pointed me to or give a very basic syntax summary (ie, conemu.exe [switches] /cmd command [-new_console|-cur_console]... it might help a few other people having the same sort of issue and maybe save you having to respond to more idiots like me! ;-)\nJust to follow up on your points...\nWhile the current documentation might say that, I set this up in 2012, and the documentation back then was no where near where it is today..... and to be honest, once I had a working configuration, I've got better things to do with my life than figure out if its going to break in 2 or 3 years time.\nGiven what you've described, I guess my old config must have had Windows setting ConEmu's startup directory (due to removing the NoWorkingDirectory reg value), rather than ConEmu setting it on launch... that would explain how my config would work, even if, from ConEmu's perspective it possibly shouldn't.\nI don't use 'ConEmu here' because I'm using the same configuration, just with the runas key, to have an 'Admin DOS prompt' menu entry and its just easier to have it all in one .reg file (along with an export of HKCU's ConEmu settings) that I can apply to a fresh install.\n. Yes I've run conemu /?, it doesn't make it clear that -new_console has to be specified after the /cmd switch.

A representative page (for the find command) can be found at [http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?find]. Man pages also generally have a fairly rigid structure, so syntax is described before examples are given\nOh, and while I think about it, the /? help for /cmd states that it \"must be the last used switch,\" which suggests that actually, -new_console cannot be specified after /cmd <command> while the -new_console page doesn't mention that it should be specified as part of the command's commandline\n.

    "eugenesvk": "@Maximus5 \nI have a similar question \u2013 is it possible to attach a ConEmu instance in a separate pane within Total Commander?\nThere is already an addon that allows to launch a cmd/powershell inside a tab in TC http://totalcmd.net/plugring/tconsole.html, so I was wondering if somehow I could attach the awesomeness of preconfigured ConEmu there as well.\nAnd if it's not possible to connect that addon with ConEmu, is there a chance you might add support of Total Commander in the same way you currently support the default File Explorer through integration of the \"ConEmu inside\", allowing to attach a terminal window to Explorer?\nAnd the reason I'm asking here is because as far as I understand that's not a functionality TC can support on its own without changes in ConEmu (but maybe I'm totally wrong here).\nAlso, I've also left a suggestion at TC's forums http://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?t=43677&highlight=).\n. @Maximus5 \nThanks, that sound exactly what I need! Though I don't understand how to use it.\nWould you please provide some instructions there?\n1. I've managed to open the ConEmuInside.csproj file in VS 2015 Community 14.0.24720.0 and successfully launch the window with ConEmu (same as the one you have in your screenshot). But how do I actually attach it to TotalCommander?\n   I can run the generated ConEmuInside.exe file, but then again it only shows what you have in your screenshot.\n   By the way, the the settings window of ConEmu after you start the solution is not scaled properly and can't be resized (tried it both with default settings and my settings file from regular ConEmu installation):\n   \n   And a minor bug: the last button where you select where to source settings file from is not working (no file selection dialogue is opened)\n   \n2. As a second step, I've tried to run the attach to process to TotalCommander, but then again, not sure what to expect from this.\n   After trying to attache to explorer.exe, thought, I've got my Alt-Tab menu decrease in size and not fit the icons anymore\n   \nSo how do I use this awesome tool ;)?\n. 1. As I mentioned above I already have asked the TC author and also the author of the plugin that shows a shell inside TC. Tough I guess he could just say the same thing: \"Ask ConEmu author\". Also, given that it was you, not Microsoft, who enabled integration with Windows Explorer, I thought it'd also make sense to ask you about the TC integration.\n2. It's Windows 10.0.10586. And these bugs don't appear with default ConEmu installation (i.e. the one that can embed processes in Windows Explorer, both settings window and Alt-Tab work fine)\n. > The Inside mode is described in docs\nYou're right, I've only seen the first part before (on the ConEmu Inside option for Explorer). Still, after reading this I'm not sure as to where to get the HWND code of a tab inside TC. Is that something only TC developer would know or can it be check by some utility?\n\nif TC can provide the \"space\" for terminal, or there are existing plugins which may do that, you may run ConEmu inside TC easily\n\nAnd as I've mentioned and linked above, the answer to both is yes, TC provides such a functionality and there is already an addon that allows to show show cmd/powershell consoles inside a separate tab in TC. The question still remains how to utilize that space to 'inject' ConEmu instead of the terminal in that addon. And you're best suited to answer that question since you've already done this for Explorer.\nIs there a chance you could at least look at that addon and see if there is a simple fix that can place ConEmu in that space the addon creates? Otherwise of course it's up to you whether to spend time developing a TC addon, just thought that since there is already something similar maybe that wouldn't take much time, but I have no idea.\n\nAfter trying to attache to explorer.exe\n\nNevermind, was just trying to do random things to try to see how the inside option worked, so thought if I chose the explorer.exe process it would spawn a ConEmu process inside.\n. Ok, I've finally managed to get somewhere, but wow that ConEmu Inside github link (https://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-inside) just led me astray and wasted a lot of time because it didn't accept any of the commands to actually inject anything. And since I wasn't sure whether it was a wrong HWND or something else, I realized too late I should just ignore it and use the regular way to launch ConEmu.exe. Have no clue why you'd even link there instead of pasting a simple command line of the already existing ConEmu.exe.\nSee the error message below (and I've tried all different combinations of the syntax, including the correct one that I found out)\n\nAnd about that command \u2014 the main description (https://conemu.github.io/en/InsideParent.html) contains a mistake in command syntax that also took me a while to realize (I thought I entered wrong HWNDs): the commands should be with a slash / instead of a hyphen/dash -. And this insidewnd switch isn't anywhere in the help menu of the main program either.\nAnyway, finally I realized that the proper syntax is \nConEmu64.exe /insidewnd 0xHWND /config \"inside\" /single /cmd {PS} after I've looked how \"ConEmu Inside\" was launched from the registry.\nNow, back to the HWND and TotalCommander, here is the rub \u2014 the only proper HWND space that can inject ConEmu is the space that addon creates, but the addon also overwrites ConEmu output because it has a console of its own.\n1. So you'd get something like this \u2014 notice the highlighted ConEmu status bar at the bottom with powershell while cmd is actually shown because that addon overwrites ConEmu output.\n   \n2. Alternatively, if I try to inject in an empty TC tab with folders I get the top and the bottom of the window, but not the middle. Notice the status bar at the bottom, command line at the top and regular TC window in the middle.\n   \nThere is a chance there is some window HWND that I've missed, although I think I've tried all of the ones Spy++ showed.\nOtherwise I guess we're back to square one \u2014 you need an addon in TC to generate an empty window that ConEmu can hook into and no addon would do that because it would generate a window for its own purposes :(\nI'll check with the TC author to see if there is an HWND that can be used as well as with the addon author to see if there is a way to generate a simple new HWND and call ConEmu with that HWND instead of hooking the default cmd/PS consoles.\n. Ok, I've found two better spots and one additional problem (solving which would allow to embed almost like in WinExplorer)\n1) Tree-view on the left hand side \u2014 this whole window gets hijacked, so it's almost perfect (there are just a few artifacts when you browse because TC sometimes overwrites parts of ConEmu)\n2) In horizontal arrangement if you decrease the bottom panel to something like ~15% then you'd only see ConEmu window (since it injects itself at the top of the panel) so you'd get ~4 lines of text (of course if you have no tabs for ConEmu)\nHowever, the additional problem is that HWNDs are dynamic, so then, @Maximus5, a few extra questions are:\n1) Is there a way to identify a window's HWND by it's position relative to the process window (e.g. get an HWND of the left-most window)?\n2) Is there a way to identify a window's HWND by its other attributes (e.g. Caption/Class seem to be the same regardless of dynamic HWNDs)\n3) Is there a way to reference a window by its other attributes instead of HWND?\nAs a side note, I've noticed that in Windows Explorer an empty preview area has no HWND, yet you're able to inject there. How do you find that area and can a similar process be maybe used in TC?\nAnd if 1-3 are no-gos, would you be open to adding those additional fields so that ConEmu could be embedded in more applications?\nThanks for your consideration.\n. I don't know why ConEmu requires them, but more importantly \u2014 it doesn't matter what I think the reason is. The problem is the lack of description of such requirement either in the docs or the app.\n\nHWND is strict and unambiguous option\n\nAnd those two qualities are not everything. For example, I use Autohotkey to enable some app-based shortcuts and practically there is always a combo of some window properties that are unique to the application I need to set up hotkeys for.\nSo here is how I'd imagine it \u2014 ConEmu would optionally read additional fields for a process/window (e.g. process name, window caption/class/style or whatever \u2014 you know this better than I do) and allow the user to pass those as arguments.\nIf I know HWND \u2014 that's great! Strictness and clarity are awesome! If not \u2014 not a big deal. I can achieve exactly the same result through other standard process/window parameters.\nCan there be a fringe case when ConEmu would fail to attach itself because there is another process \"Total Commander\" with window caption\"W_TreeList1\" and class \"LCLListBox\" and style \"56010153\"? Theoretically \u2014 sure, practically \u2014 no way, it's as close to strict and unambiguous as HWND is. But wait, it's even better \u2014 I have no clue what HWND is, but I can check those other fields. And even if a bad match ever happens \u2014 no big deal, a 99% success rate is much better than 0% success rate, because currently I can't do anything.\n\nObviously only their authors may advise you about.\n\nAnd that's exactly the problem! Currently you expect every other app to be aware of and make an adjustment for ConEmu. While there is no good reason for that. Autohotkey doesn't expect each app to pass some unique arguments so it can identify it and ConEmu could be the same.\n. So would you please consider adding additional parameters to the mix besides PID and HWND? It's just such a waste of this awesome feature \u2014 ability to embed in any app that has some free window space lying around. No addons, no nothing, just pure ConEmu awesomeness inside :)\n. Just tested with a fresh install of ConEmu 160228 portable and this bug is not reproduced. Seems some cmder settings interfere or something. Will leave this open while trying to isolate what the exact cause of this issue is.\n. The issue appears when I enable https://github.com/mridgers/clink. Using default fresh install, no settings changed.\nAny idea why this is happening? Will also open an issue with clink, not sure what is going on here :(\n. Thanks for a prompt response!\nDo you have an idea whether there is a way to make clink aware of these codes?\nI'm trying to shift to configuring prompt via clink, but it's much harder for me since it's lua and not many examples to copy&paste&adjust from, documentation isn't great :(\n.

I was trying to ask Mintty author to implement a simple Ctrl-C/V to copy&paste remapping and he was very resistant referencing some stupid 30-year-old standard (even though top terminals in Linux allow you to happily remap copy&paste to ^C/V and move interrupt/next line sequences to another keybind, e.g. Ctrl-Shift-C or something).\nBut gladly I can just use your awesome connector and not remember for just one use-case that copy&paste is mapped to something else vs. all my other apps.\n. Thank you, this seems to be fixed!\n. 1. Ok, though just to clarify, I didn't mean autoupdating when ConEmu was running, but only on launch of the first instance.\n2. &3. Understood. Surely wouldn't want to add crazy issues elsewhere since my situation is not very frequent so could live with some manual hack (e.g. restarting AHK or maybe just adding that path to ConEmu environment var)\n. > Just use env.vars.\nHave you tried it before recommending? It doesn't work and my guess is because you're not using the clink.bat to launch clink, but rather injecting it with a direct command, so this env. var is simply not read.\nThat's why the only way is for you to pass that variable from ConEmu when you inject clink. You can use an env. var for that, I don't mind, I can set to to ConEmu/config/*.lua in the settings.\n. Of course I have, and it doesn't work neither with env. var, nor with a direct command replacement in the clink.bat start \"Clink\" cmd.exe /s /k \"\"%~dpnx0\" inject --profile c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\config\\cmd Init Clink.lua\"\nThat's why I though you didn't use env var, but obviously that's not true.\nIs there something else that I need to set up?\n. 1) Ok, let's call it problem with how ConEmu configures clink injection, not that important.\nWhen I turn off Feature -> Use clink in prompt and inject clink myself via c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\clink\\clink_x64.exe inject --quiet --profile c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\config\\ in my cmd Init.bat which I invoke in Tasks with with \"%windir%\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /k \"%ConEmuDir%\\config\\cmd Init.bat\" it works.\nHowever, if I turn clink injection in ConEmu on and put the exact same line in c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\clink\\clink.bat (or change it to the format you have start \"Clink\" cmd.exe /s /k \"c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\clink\\clink_x64.exe inject --profile c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\config\\\" it doesn't work. I still injects clink, but doesn't seem to pass the profile string to it. When I've tried to add just --quiet switch it also didn't work.\n2) %clink_profile_arg% variable in a) c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\clink\\clink.bat, b) in Startup - Environment. I realized b) doesn't make sense because you have set clink_profile_arg= in clink.bat anyway, which resets it.\n3) 160403a [64]\n. 1) Well, it's only obvious to you since you know how ConEmu injects clink :) \u2014 I only see Use clink in prompt setting. That's exactly why I'm asking you to add to ConEmu the ability to pass `--profile path\\to\\profile\".\n\nany of start in clink.bat would never work \n\nWhy are we discussing the clink.bat then since that start command is the only place where clink_profile_arg is used as an argument to clink. If you ConEmu ignores that command (because it's already launched a console), then the only way seems to be for ConEmu to add the --profile flag itself, no?\n2) I put set clink_profile_arg=--quiet --profile c:\\Dev\\ConEmu\\config\\ in ConEmu  Startup - Environment and, separately, at the start of clink.bat file or instead of line 54 set clink_profile_arg=\nBut again, it doesn't matter because ConEmu ignores the start command where this variable is used. \nAlso, editing clink.bat is a bad option since it's likely to be overwritten on updates and also defeats the purpose of being able to set all config files in one config folder\n3) Sorry, Win10x64, clink 0.4.7\n. > You have full control over clink.bat, so I still do not see any use of proposed option and there is nothing to do with ConEmu\nI've already mentioned the point, actually two, but am happy to repeat:\na) on upgrade of clink it's way easier to just drag&drop new version without having to think that you've actually modified one of the package files\nb) it means that my goal of having all config files in one folder can't be achieved. And with your proposal it's even worse because at least clink profile doesn't get overwritten on updates while this new clink.bat will be\n\nWell, let me modify clink.bat for you if you can't do this personally\n\nThanks, but after you've mentioned that ConEmu ignores the start part I was able to find the solution \u2014 without any debug prints: \"%~dp0\\clink_x64.exe\" inject %clink_profile_arg%. You have an extra %* that is not needed (since start part is ignored)\nBut this is a bad solution for reasons specified above.\n\nAnyway, this enhancement is for clink only\n\nNo, it's not unique to clink. What I've requested is only one way to solve it. The other way would be for the app that injects clink (i.e. ConEmu) to be able to pass command line parameters to it. \n. > It looks like a lack of clink, but not a ConEmu.\nYou can't clearly make it exclusive to clink. It's arguably easier to say \"why can't ConEmu pass a simple command line switch that's already implemented\" because that's the default way command line utilities operate \u2014 by accepting command-line arguments.\n\nSure. But what for? If this may be perfectly implemented inside clink.bat?\n\nIt's hard to answer this one \u2014 change those words to ConEmu and ConEmu settings and you've got an identical question.\nOk, will wait for the clink developer to respond. Though he's not as responsive as you are (thanks for that).\nBut hopefully you would reconsider and maybe add support for passing command line parameters to clink (no need to even change the settings GUI, the env var can be defined in statup->environment)\n.

    "llinfeng": "@Maximus5 Could you please clarify the syntax that is used by the Task.txt files? I have read the docs, and tried all that I can, but I am really bad at names + syntax. Here is what I have got from the following Task.txt file:\n\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i  -new_console:d:C:\\Users\\llinfeng\\Nutstore\n-cur_console:d:C:\\Users\\llinfeng -cur_console:t:reading \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i\n The first line of content is copied from the setting page where \"Predefined tasks\" are defined, to be found as: Settings/Startup/Tasks\n The second line of content is copied from the \"Auto save/restore opened tabs\" option under Setting/Startup.\n* What I have achieved so far: start multiple consoles from git-bash, with customizable tab/console names.\nQuestion:\nCan I specify tasks that also run a set of commands, each from a separate console/tab? Here goes my daily tasks that I would like to keep running on the machine that I am physically working on.\n latexmk building/compiling task/job for my paper (alias defined as paper)\n latexmk building/compiling task/job for my notes (alias defined as notes)\n* latexmk building/compiling task/job for my reading-list (alias defined as reading).\nPS: Limitation for the restore option.\nCurrently, I can (re-)generate myself three consoles named as paper, notes and reading through the Restore option, specified as follows. Yet, my previous running jobs are ignored when I restart ConEMU, and my previous working directories should have been reset to my home directory.\n\n. Oh, by \"task\", I am more or less thinking about something more literal: that in a console that I start, I am expecting to have a certain process running. I should have confused \"task\" with \"process\". I am pretty sure my use-case is rather limited: I only use git-bash, and I only use latexmk on it. \nSolution:\n@Maximus5 Thank you for bringing up the -c handle, I am achieving what I originally had in mind!! \ud83d\udc4d Here goes the running example of mine:\n```\n-cur_console:d:C:\\Users\\llinfeng -cur_console:t:reading \"%ConEmuDir%..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i -c \"reading\"\n-cur_console:d:C:\\Users\\llinfeng -cur_console:t:notes \"%ConEmuDir%..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i -c \"notes\"\n-cur_console:d:C:\\Users\\llinfeng -cur_console:t:paper \"%ConEmuDir%..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i -c \"paper\"\n```\nIt is clunky code, but it really does the job: kick off the processes right when ConEMU restarts.\nPS: on setting git-bash as the \"Default task for new console\".\nAfter specifying a \"Tasks file\" under Settings/Startup, the set of tasks specified as such shall take precedence against all existing tasks. Thus, by default, if one were to map, say <c-t> (Ctrl + T) for Create new console or new window (check \"Multiple consoles in one ConEmu window\"), s/he will see all those specified tasks are all started afresh. I fix this by going to the Settings/Startup/Tasks and made {Bash::Git bash} the \"Default task for new console\" (there is a checkbox to the left).. ",

    "afilp": "FYI, I had already created an issue at JetBrains, back in May 2015:\nhttps://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-140298\nPlease vote for it (and/or comment there). Thanks.\n. @Maximus5 My only problem with ConEmu being external to WebStorm is that I cannot switch to Terminal with the \"Alt-F12\" keyboard shortcut (once it is already open), as described in my original post here:\n\"every time I hit \"Alt-F12\" (WebStorm's shortcut) to go into the \"Terminal\", the ConEmu window does not get the focus.\"\nI also cannot \"hide\" the Terminal view (in other words return to my WebStorm code view) with \"SHIFT-ESC\", while I am on ConEmu. This is reasonable though (since \"SHIFT-ESC\" would be triggered inside the external ConEmu, NOT WebStorm), so I could just do \"Alt-Tab\" and return to WebStorm (I would prefer the \"SHIFT-ESC\" obviously, if it is possible for ConEmu to know that it \"originated\" from a WebStorm process and give it the focus). But once I switch to WebStorm with the \"Alt Tab\" then I still need to press \"SHIFT-ESC\" because the focus remains on the Terminal (due to the previous \"Alt-F12\"), and not to the code view.\nI understand that this problem may need to be solved by WebStorm, rather than ConEmu, if ConEmu remains external. WebStorm needs to treat \"Alt-F12\" differently when an external terminal is used. I believe that it should not open the small Terminal view at the bottom and give it focus but rather trigger the \"re-focus\" of the external ConEmu instance that was opened by the initial \"Alt-F12\". If this is implemented, then doing \"Alt-Tab\" from the ConEmu window will get us again inside the \"Code View\" of WebStorm (or where we were before), so the switching process will be fast.\nDoes this make sense at all?\n.

I've not found in you url why \"detach on conemu window close\" is impossible (however every tab in conemu has detach option right now), but I trust your experience in this topic.\nWhat about using pending moves in installer?\n. Why stopping injected threads and FreeLibrary can't help?\nOnce again - what about using pending moves in installer?\n. Why you think that it's unwanted behavior? It's standard behavior for system-wide updates. Console window is definitely system object. Isn't it?\n. You can reset color in shell prompt.\nFor bash/zsh/... it is $PS1, so you should replace PS1='\\$ ' with PS1='\\e[0m\\$ ' in your .bashrc file.\nFor command.com/cmd.exe it is changed by command like prompt $e[0m$p$g which you can add to registry entry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor:AutoRun (directly or via .bat file).\n. Maybe writing N empty lines on shell startup (in something like .bashrc) will help you?\nUnfortunately there are no correct way to get \"DefaultBufferHeight\" option (GetOption macro is awful).\n. It's a pity.\n. @Maximus5 I've discovered that version with word suffix (\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"dev\", \"nightly\") marked in chocolatey as prerelease. So anyone can choose whether to use cup conemu to use stable channel or cup conemu -pre to use bleeding-edge version.\n. Thanks.\n. When videocard-native textmode was replaced by windows console emulation we've lost ability to control font. Then fonts got unicode and application-specific fonts become insane relict.\nSo correct solution for your suggestion is:\n1. Request (or find) related symbols in unicode.\n2. Wait until windows support it.\n3. Request Far team to detect they are supported and use them.\nNothing to change in ConEmu.\n. Command conemuc /guimacro:t1 close(0,0) closes tab 1.\n. You ever can setup task with either bash -c 'cd /cygdrive/c/code;exec bash -i' or bash --rcfile ~/.devrc (with cd .../code in .devrc`).\nObviously same achievable with zsh.\n. @Maximus5 You are right.\nOnly difference of using bash option --login - sourcing .bash_profile (or .profile) and /etc/profile instead of .bashrc.\nCygwin default /etc/profile does cd $HOME if ${CHERE_INVOKING} not defined.\nSo if you want to use profile your one-line command should be bash -c 'cd /code;CHERE_INVOKING=1 exec bash -i --login'. Command using setup script shouldn't be changed, because all you need is to configure script that you want to setup environment. I.e.:\nBash\n. /etc/profile\n. ~/.bash_profile\ncd /code\n. -1\n1. Do you want to drop files in unix format to non-unix consoles? How unix console should be detected?\n2. How you propose to convert path to unix format? It's not just prepending \"/cygdrive/\". Mintty takes cygwin mounts into account. There are functions in cygwin dll - cygwin_conv_path() and relatives. They only can be called from cygwin process. Also there are cygwin binary - cygpath. You definitely don't want to create new process for each D&D.\n3. What about having several installations of cygwin on single computer (cygwin32 and cygwin64 for example). Mintty supposed to run binaries of same cygwin installation. How you propose to detect which cygwin to use?\n. What about SFU of other posix layer versions?\n. There was several similar packages:\n1. POSIX subsystem delivered with NT since 3.51 till 2000.\n2. Interix\n3. Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU).\n. BTW:\n1. Thanks for referencing Apps+Ins. I was unaware of this feature.\n2. This feature has nothing near \"cygwin path\" it states. Real cygwin path should do same as cygpath -u do.\n. :-1: Separately disablable, please.\n. :+1: It would also be usable to drag .lnk file and extract from it not only command line but also run dir and icon path/number.\n. @jimdi Pass arguments to far - active and passive panels path.\n. It depends on site lifecycle (sorry, not yet investigated). But something like this module.\n. From my point of view it's expected behaviour:\nWhen you starting cmd from cmd it has process \"tree\" like cmd -> cmd\nWhen you starting cmd from conemu it has process tree like:\nconemu -> cmd\n      \\-> cmd\n. Search mentioned page for \"history\" word.\n. @cadayton, Maybe by \"putty\" you mean \"plink\"? This is only sane interpretation I can imagine.\n. https://conemu.github.io/en/AlternativeBuffer.html\n. Use less instead of cat.\nBut your request can be reformulated to more useful: Add escape-sequence to bookmark places to scroll to. You can add this sequence to $PS1 and use as requested.\n. Already implemented in mintty: https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/569#issuecomment-282382709. @Maximus5, could you please explain \u2014 what do you dislike?\n\nImplementing new (non-standard) escape sequence?

There was misunderstanding also. I've mentioned only copying solution \u2014 not implementation. I.e. I want to be sure that escape sequences for same features existing in mintty and conemu will be same.. I've recently found that VT300+ standard contains ability to show pictures and ever video. Corresponding output mode named Sixel.\nRelated links:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel\nhttp://saitoha.github.io/libsixel/\nhttps://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/572\n\nSupporting such mode may allow rewrite of addons like conemu-thumbnail in more standard-conforming way.\nI understood if you tag this FR as \"pr needed\".\n.

I don't see any hotkey to toggle quake mode.\n. @Maximus5 I'm using the minimize/restore hotkey to hide and show the quake style window, but I don't want to use the \"Restore to active monitor\" option because I prefer ConEmu to stay on a certain monitor.  The problem is my preferred monitor is an external monitor and when I un-dock my laptop, ConEmu defaults back to the laptop display, which is good.  But when I re-dock my laptop, ConEmu still restores to the laptop display and I would like to move it quickly (preferably without opening the options window) to my preferred external monitor.\n. @elijahgagne I think that is what this issue it addressing, the standard windows shortcuts (win+arrow) do not work when ConEmu is in quake mode.  My specific question was if anyone knew of a combination of hotkeys or a macro that could be used to achieve the desired outcome until this issue is resolved.  I can move it by opening the settings dialog, turning off quake mode, moving it, then open the settings dialog again and reset a bunch of things that got reset when turning off quake mode.

I've disabled the keyboard hooks and also unassigned the hotkeys for win+shift+right/left and it still does nothing while in quake mode.  \nThe macro I have now is working pretty well, the only thing it is missing is resetting the \"frame width\" setting to 0 since something is changing it to -1.  @Maximus5 are there any plans to allow numeric or text options like frame width to be set through gui macros?\nIn case anyone is curious, what I'm at right now is:\nsetoption(\"Check\",2333,0); WindowMode(\"NOR\"); WindowMode(\"MNEXT\"); setoption(\"Check\",2333,1); setoption(\"Check\",2466,1); windowpossize(0,0,0,30); windowmode(\"MAX\");\n2333 is quake mode, 2466 is autohide, I have my window height at 30 when in quake mode.

    "jmlucjav": "@Igonato works for me, only not maximized of course!! cool (win10). ok what I meant is: it works with a quake windows if it is not maximized.. in a cmd. exe commandline, you can ignore 'start' it changes nothing. \n. 1.

    "mfeemster": "ktetzlaff,\nEven in a regular cmd console, if the program does not reset the colors upon exit, it will remain with whatever colors the program was using.\n. I've looked into this further, and it turns out that having the command box for sync dir empty prevents the option from saving. This seems counter intuitive since the tool tip shows what the default command is. In order for it to save and work correctly, I have to manually enter \"cd \\1\\n\" in the box.\nIf there is a default, it should just be used without the user having to manually enter it.\n. This seems pretty counter intuitive, the purpose of a setting is to save a specified behavior. Also, it does save, so long as the text box is not empty. I'm just saying that if a default is known, it should be auto populated and saved with that default value when the user selects the checkbox.\nI have tried and verified this with both cmd.exe and powershell.exe, so I'm pretty sure ConEmu recognizes them.\nEdit to clarify what happens:\nRegister ConEmu Inside, whether sync dir is checked or not results in a registry key being saved here:\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT*\\shell\\ConEmu Inside\\command\nWith a value of (powershell in my case):\n\"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" \"/inside\" /cmd powershell.exe -new_console:a\nThat gives no instruction to ConEmu as to how it should change directories. However, if I enter the default cd command syntax in the box:\ncd \\1\\n\nand register again, it's properly saved like so:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" \"/inside=cd \\1\\n\" /cmd powershell.exe -new_console:a\nMy point is that the user should not have to manually type in \"cd \\1\\n\" when selecting Sync dir, especially since ConEmu already knows what the default change directory command is since it tells you so in the tool tip. Instead, it should automatically pre-populate the text box with that command.\n. Thanks, I did not notice the option in the status bar, as I had it hidden.\n.

I also find that color settings seem to behave differently when using the default cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Is this because of how they both use color, or is it a bug?\n. Thanks Siddharth, this does fix it. Good find! I'm glad it was not just me who was seeing this. On a side note, I find that if I use PowerShell, it seems to override the color settings with its own regardless of what I do. This is fine with me as the functionality of it far outweighs nitpicking over the color.\n. I am admin on my machine, so I don't think that was my issue. Thanks though.\n. ",
    "ktetzlaff": "Thanks for all the feedback!\n@Maximus5: The 'shell' i'm using in this case is TCC/LE (tcc.exe). Screenshots are attached below. But maybe playing with prompt (s. below) is already a solution.\n@pyhedgehog: Using prompt and the AutoRun registry entry sounds promising. I'll give it a try!\n\n\n. Actually, the prompt approach works. TCC/LE also supports the prompt $e[<attr>;<attr>;...m syntax to add ANSI sequences to the prompt.\nSo, as pyhedgehog wrote, adding $e[0m to the prompt resets all terminal attributes to their defaults and solves my problem.\nThanks again!\n.

    "SiddharthPant": "Well same thing happened with me. The prompt will be colored but not when launching it from 'ConEmu Here'. What solved this for me was replacing 'cmd -cur_console:n' to  '{cmd}' in the 'Command:' textbox above. Launching 'cmd' from 'Run' window of OS still gives you washed out colors\n\n\n. Happy to help there. Actually this post popped up as one of the first on google and your screenshot above at #170 above actually helped me to decipher the solution. Thought it will be good to elaborate my find. \n@mfeemster do you have the setup similar to mine. My weird setup has basically an 'Admin' account and a standard account 'Sid' with ConEmu settings in C:\\Softwares\\Conemu\\Conemu.xml (Account 'Sid' has ownership of folder 'Softwares'). I think this might be throwing ConEmu colors off because of some permission issue. Does ConEmu derives its color profile settings from somewhere where a Standard account might not have permission to do anything.\n. ",

So why can't it lock the regular touchpad or mouse wheel scrolling to that range? What's the purpose of allowing the screen to fly below the range that has any actual text in it?\nTo put it another way: if I grab the scrollback handle, I'm limited to the correct range. If I want to scroll past that, for whatever obscure reason, I can always click on the arrow button at the end of the scrollbar.\nWould it be possible to restrict the WheelDown and WheelUp events to the same \"dynamic\" range? Can we do it using a macro?\nBy the way, I'm already using the macros Scroll(0,1) and Scroll(0,-1) on WheelDown and WheelUp, because the default scrolling speed is way too high for a touchpad. If I could, I would reduce it even more, but Scroll() doesn't accept a float argument.. ",

If I have Window 1 with tabs A & B, and Window 2 with tab C.

If a right click is registered in one, it registers in all (without changing focus... and ignoring position I suppose).  Same with ctrl-v?\nOr perhaps the console could have a paste shortcut, where it would take what's in the clipboard, and enter it as if it were keyboard input into each window?\nOr if it the console could tell if it's a shell (cmd/sh/bash) that specifically supports it it adds that?\n. I might have read way to far into that.\nI'm running cmd and bash in the tabs and right clicking to paste, but ctrl-v doesn't work either.\n. In trouble shooting it I realized conemu and mintty are both terminals.  So it was a bit redundant.  Not sure if it should work that way or not.  Though when WinGit2 replaces the current one, I'm sure many more people will run into this issue.\nI'm not sure how git-bash.exe is launching it, but I just created a shortcut file that kind of matched that msys did when it fell bash to sh:\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /A /C C:\\msysGit\\usr\\bin\\bash --login -i\nand that seems to work fine.

Thus far, I haven't found any way around the multiple tabs.\n@Maximus5, is it possible to make ConEmu hide a tab (without showing the original, hidden console window)? If so, that would likely be a usable workaround.\n. I should have added that the following task command works, at least for the time being, without the multiple-tab side effect.\nset MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe\" --login -i -new_console:t:\"Git Bash\":C:\"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\\mingw64\\share\\git\\git-for-windows.ico\"\nI'd prefer to avoid this approach, however, since git-bash.exe may perform additional setup which causes this method to break in future.\n.

    "eracpp": "The WScript.Shell object allows external commands to be run from within a VBScript that is run using a command such as cscript myscript.vbs.\nWhen such a script is executed from within a ConEmu shell, ConEmu seems to treat the WScript.Shell object as a new shell (thus generating a new ConEmu tab) within which all commands within the script run until the script is completed, after which the shell (the tab) is closed on its own.\nHere is a page that describes the process in detail.\n. Ah, my bad.\nI'm calling GNU Make to build a C++ program.\nThe command I'm passing is make main, which calls GNU Make 4.1, which in turn uses a Makefile to build the program using the given source files, etc.\nThe build process only takes a few seconds, thus the message.\n. It creates the tab on its own.\nJust like when I use the start command in an already opened cmd shell, it creates a new tab with a new cmd shell on its own.\nI do not explicitly instruct ConEmu in any way that I am aware of to create a new tab.\n. No, I did not pass -new_console:n with the start command.\nHowever, doing so has produced the behavior I was intending (no message).\nBefore: oShell.Run(\"make main\")\nAfter: oShell.Run(\"make main -new_command:n\")\nIf I'm understanding this correctly, I am manually creating a new shell with the no-message property instead of letting the program make it on its own.\nDoes this mean that I have to tag -new_command:n at the end of every command I pass?\nThere is no way to instruct ConEmu to use the above as a default behavior (is putting it in the commands window in Tasks meaningless)?\n.

    "angularsen": "Sorry for the late reply, but I confirm @Jaykul 's answer. I recently upgraded to 150707 on Win 8.1 x64, and started off with fresh settings.\n- Disable Install keyboard hooks option\n- Set Activate console by numbers hotkeys to Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 etc..\nThis allows you to switch apps with Win+{num} keys and switch tabs with Ctrl+{num}.\n. I understand your frustration, really, but the reason I went here is that I could only reproduce this in ConEmu, as per my bullet point 3. Please understand that many of us users of ConEmu have very little knowledge of how everything works together. I did read that link you posted, prior to creating the issue, but still didn't realize this was not a ConEmu issue for sure. Just trying to explain my point of view, no criticism intended.\n. Thank you for the command to try out, that really highlights where the problem lies.\n. You have documented things well and it was very helpful to have a contribution guideline, but I did experience it a bit too much information and effort in the context of just reporting a bug, so I wound up skimming the information and failed to recognize that my problem was outside of ConEmu. I do take blame for not reading everything properly, but I also think the information can be improved a bit to make it easier to understand this scenario for other users reporting similar bugs in the future.\nHere are some changes that might have helped me pick up on things earlier:\nContribution guideline article\nVery good, I did skim through this and found the Third Party article that way, but still didn't fully grasp Git Bash application vs. Mintty vs Standard Windows Terminal vs ConEmu. Especially terms like terminal and mintty have confused me a lot earlier, but have not had much incentive to learn more about them until now so I failed to see how they were relevant.\nUnder Reporting issues, I think the single sentence and link to Third Party software could be improved. It seems a bit unimportant the way it is written, and I also first thought it was about plugins and such.\nHere is what I propose:\nAdd Verify issue really originates from ConEmu as the first sub-section under Reporting Issues\n- Short description of how 90% of reported bugs are really a bug in the console application\n- List 2-3 relevant examples that you frequently see, such as what console app was run, what was the symptom, and what command could they run to verify the problem was outside ConEmu.\nTo me at least, it would be very relevant to see the Git for Windows example listed here, as well as the command to reproduce c:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-cmd.exe --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i.\n- Add the link to Third Party software problems as a \"read more\" kind of thing. Hopefully, most have got the point by now.\nHope this helps. Thanks for the awesome software!\n. This is good. Here are some additional suggestions:\nTLDR; Run the exact same console application and arguments as in your ConEmu task to reproduce outside ConEmu. If you are able to reproduce, then the problem is NOT with ConEmu.\nHaving problems with vim in Git bash? Go to settings, find {Bash::Git bash} task and find the command: \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i, then run this in Win + R and then run vim from there.\n\nIf you catch a bug in the Adobe Reader you would not report it\non Microsoft Connect because you run Reader in Windows, would you?\nConEmu is a terminal (console window), so if a console application (bash, vim, cmd, ...) gives broken output or interaction, ConEmu can't magically correct this.\nA lot of users say \u2018It works in cygwin\u2019 or \u2018It works in git bash\u2019.\nWrong!

I agree, reading back on it, it definitely does not simplify things. I started simple, then it grew overboard. \n1. The purpose of table 1 was to try to help understand why Git Bash shortcut differs from Git Bash in ConEmu, especially that mintty is used as terminal. But the point does not really come across well. I do think table 2 serves that purpose better, at least for me.\nHere is an updated full text suggestion. I've skipped formatting and links as I was not able to copy that easily.\nVerify issue really originates from ConEmu!\nIf you catch a bug in the Adobe Reader you would not report it on Microsoft Connect because you run Reader in Windows, would you?\nA lot of users say \u2018It works in cygwin\u2019 or \u2018It works in git bash\u2019, but since both of them uses the mintty terminal, it can exhibit different behavior. Read more in Do not compare with Cygwin or Git Bash.\nTLDR;\nRun the exact same console application and arguments as in your ConEmu task to reproduce outside ConEmu. If you are able to reproduce, then the problem is NOT with ConEmu.\nUnderstand how ConEmu works\nConEmu is just a terminal (also called console window) that runs console apps. Often these are CLI apps, such as CMD, Powershell, and Git Bash, but it can be any standard Windows console application. \nConEmu shows the output of console applications and passes keyboard/mouse events to the app. That is more or less it.\nDo not compare with Cygwin or Git Bash\nA frequent misunderstanding is seeing buggy behavior running Git Bash in ConEmu, then comparing that with either Cygwin or running Git Bash outside ConEmu. This is not the same thing!\nBoth are just a software packages, and you run console utilities (bash, vim, git) in the POSIX compatible terminal mintty, but mintty is not compatible with Windows console API.\nSo, each Cygwin or msys (git-bash) console application has two branches of code, and obviously, they behaves differently when they were started from mintty and from standard Windows console.\nOf course, if the branch of code, which utilizes Windows console API, has bugs, they would not be observed in mintty. So, run your console tool from Win+R directly, without mintty wrapper.\nRead more information in the article: third-party software\nExample: #618 VI/VIM very unresponsive after upgrading to Git 2.8.0.windows.1\n\nvim was unresponsive in ConEmu's Git Bash\nvim worked just fine when running Git Bash shortcut, so the user reasoned the bug must be related to ConEmu\nAuthor explained you need to run the exact same command as ConEmu does, to avoid running with the mintty wrapper. \nIn {Bash::Git bash} task: \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i, which typically equals \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i\nUser then ran this in Win + R and then ran vim from there, and saw the same behavior - outside of ConEmu\n\nProcesses as seen in task manager:\nTo illustrate how running the Git Bash shortcut differs from running Git Bash inside ConEmu, take a look at the output from task manager. As you can see, mintty.exe is used for the shortcuts, while git-cmd.exe is used by ConEmu, skipping the mintty wrapper.\n| What | Name | Description | Command line |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Git Bash shortcut | mintty.exe | Terminal | usr\\bin\\mintty.exe -o AppID=GitForWindows.Bash -o RelaunchCommand=\"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-bash.exe\" -o RelaunchDisplayName=\"Git Bash\" -i /mingw64/share/git/git-for-windows.ico /usr/bin/bash --login -i |\n| {Git Bash} in ConEmu | git-cmd.exe | Git for Windows | \"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i |\n| Git CMD shortcut | git-cmd.exe | Git for Windows | \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --cd-to-home |\n| {cmd} in ConEmu | git-cmd.exe | Git for Windows | \"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i |\nRead more:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConsoleApplication.html\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/TerminalVsShell.html\n.

    "mtelesha": "I believe the issue is with conemu and doesn't communicate the terminal to the server. I had the same sort of issue with vagrant ssh. Git-Bash and cynwin both worked fine but conemu and cmder both had issues with arrow keys and backspace. ctl-shift + V + backspace gave the proper ^$.\nMy solution which returned full arrow navigation and backspace:\nexport TERM=vt100\nHere is a quick screen cast of the bug and then behavior after the fix.\nhttps://youtu.be/EtazaEPGQzk\n. I don't have to do this with any other tool I use for ssh. Putty, Moba Xterm, git-bash, cygwin all work out of the box. If this is an SSH issue then none of them should work?\nBTW I loved ConEmu and am really excited I can use it for ssh.\n. I listed out TOOLS that I use with SSH that works (I didn't say that they were the same just I use SSH in Windows because I have to and these TOOLS work). You treated me like an ignorant child with your bold and \"How Many Times I have to Say That.\"\nConEmu does NOT work with ssh into Vagrant or to SSH servers unless the user communicates their terminal with TERM or use stty. You could put this in FAQ or the README and then people would know how to get ConEmu and cmder to work in ssh, BUT I guess I wasted your time.\nSo this exchange has left a bitter taste in mouth (and I certainly won't be bothering you again.)  Also guess you didn't look at my video to see the behavior and the change this was a SOLUTION for my issue with backspace and arrows but I wasted you and my time. \n. I'll make another video which also shows that arrows and backspace and delete work for SSH in Window's  cmd, PowerShell and git-bash. When i use those inside ConEmu for some reason all those inside SSH my arrow, backspace and delete to not work as expected. ctl-shift + V then Backspace gives me ^$. When I echo TERM all keys work as expected again.\nThe video shows my keystrokes and what happens in Windows cmd. Backspace types a space in ConEmu but it actually still deletes on the SSH server side. Right arrow paste the prompt and up arrow does not go through my history.\n. ",

    "tristanisfeld": "@Maximus5 Hello. By the way, I appreciate your help. You seem to be everywhere, replying to everyone who needs help. I haven't seen that level of help from any developer or project. Just wanted to thank you for that.\nYes. That is enabled. I went through many options in the settings menu to try and sort it out, enabling disabling, still no luck. I even attempted to make sure that mintty had the same window size, cursor settings (with the limited options mintty has).\nI also tested to see if upon launching the terminal, before moving the application (so its still blank as in the first picture I showed), would it be able to receive input, just not receiving the updates in conemu, and when I moved the application so as to see the results, all of my input was there. So conemu isn't receiving any graphics updates until moved. Also confirmed by selecting 'fade when inactive' in the color settings, upon launching as the terminal screen is dark until moving.\nNot sure if this helps, but if I minimize conemu, and then bring it back, the cursor will then turn black outlined in white, which is the same behavior that mintty has when you go to their settings dialogue. The cursor returns to normal after leaving the dialogue while accessing through mintty, however the cursor will remain in that state while in conemu. The same occurs while accessing the mintty settings  and conemu settings, it stays black after exiting. You can write, see text etc, just not getting the graphics update for the cursor.\n. It did not. But I also had to modify the command to conemu64.exe. It still has the same behavior\n. Thank you @Maximus5 , you fixed it with that update!\n. Sorry @Maximus5 , It returned after the last update.\n. @Maximus5 - There was another update this morning, before I got this message, I updated. But now it works. I will test the last few versions tonight, and inform you of the results. It is odd, as you said nothing had changed.\n. ",

I was unable to to find the right key for that. Do you know of a concise list that lists these commands that would work straight from ConEmu?. > F7 is not processed by ConEmu. The hotkey is processed by \"cmd\".\nYes, hence the line \"work straight from ConEmu\".. @Maximus5 Actually I find it a useful feature as well for the following reason.\nOften I run a command and expect some outcome I want to check at some point, such as a debugging statement or the output of some application and obviously I can simply let the screen roll all output. But if there's a lot of output, I need to scroll a lot and sometimes it is so much even scrolling a little bit is difficult.\nThere all all kinds of solutions to this, like playing around with find piping, reducing the log buffer, tweaking the application's output or switching to a log tailer or whatever (although with simple cli output this is not trivial). The simplest solution however is to be able to clear the screen with a short-cut. I'm used to the console of IntelliJ which allows you to do that with CTRL-K and I've become addicted to it. It allows me to focus on just the information I need and avoid scrolling pains.\nThat shortcut for resetting, scrolling back and setting cursor topleft works perfectly to this end. I don't think it was a mistake to add that feature. Thanks for that.. ",

I found a document here describes my problem more precisely.\n\nOn CJK versions of Windows, applications which requires 'monospaced' fonts (for example, terminal emulators) uses glyph widths for alphabets from this field and uses the twice the width of alphabets as double-byte characters (ideographs, kanas, ...).\nOpenType Specification changed the to simple arithmetic average of all non-zero width glyphs in the font and recommends to not relying on the value of xAvgCharWidth.

    "rfgamaral": "I'm not sure I understand your point... Are you saying the current behavior of Mintty is a bug? From the view point of an user, I don't see anything that needs to be fixed in Mintty. And I don't understand why you're asking me to ask Cygwin devs to fix something I don't see as a problem.\n\nwait until ConEmu managed to implement cygwin layer without drawbacks (unpredictable)\n\nI may be misunderstanding you but were you assuming I was running Cygwin bash implementation inside ConEmu? Because that is not the case. I'm running Mintty as standalone and I just used that as example.\nTo me it's weird to have an application like nano opened and the mouse wheel scrolls the whole buffer, moving the nano UI up and down, when it should be \"fixed\" to the terminal window. I don't understand how can this possibly be considered a bug in Mintty.\n. I'm not running nano as cygwin utility (aka windows console application). I do run ssh as a windows console application (either from cygwin or msysGit). But when I'm talking about nano I'm talking about the one I run on my Linux machine when I'm connected through SSH. That one is a native UNIX console application.\nAnd nano was just an example... I can give others like rcconf and alsamixer which also show the same problem because they are all terminal apps with a \"fixed\" UI.\n. So, what you are telling me is that there's nothing that you can do and that the problem relies on the implementation of the tools themselves, like ssh.exe? And if I used an SSH console tool with a proper implementation for the Windows console API this wouldn't be a problem?\n. Just tested with Far Manager and this one works nicely under ConEmu, no scrolling and resizes properly. Tried to search for a different SSH console tool for windows that would work better but I guess there isn't one (tried Bitvise SSH Client and Putty, neither solved the problem).\nI guess I'll just have to keep Mintty at hand for SSH connections and ConEmu for everything else.\nThanks for the clarification.\n. @Maximus5 I have the same exact issue and I was able to reproduce the issue on a new ConEmu installation. Here's what I did:\n1) Downloaded latest version from GitHub releases. Extracted and accepted the default settings.\n2) Open Settings and change Main \u00bb Size & Pos \u00bb Alignment \u00bb Pad size (pixels) to something above 0 (I used 8).\n3) Open Settings and change Settings \u00bb Appearance \u00bb Scrollbar to Hide.\n4) Move mouse over scrollbar location.\nHopefully this helps you debug the issue :). Build 180416 (preview) seems to have fixed this, at least for me. Awesome work :). I'm using ConEmu, not Cmder. Removing CmdInit.cmd didn't help, I even got more \"header\" information:\n\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]\n(c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.. I removed the Windows header and the Amaral@NAZBOX by tweaking the CmdInit.cmd file (I created a copy and used my custom version instead).\n\nI just had to remove this cmd /d /c ver | \"%windir%\\system32\\find.exe\" \"Windows\" and this set ConEmuPrompt0=$E[m$E[32m$E]9;8;\"USERNAME\"$E\\@$E]9;8;\"COMPUTERNAME\"$E\\$S. And also change this set ConEmuPrompt1=%ConEmuPrompt0%$E[92m$P$E[90m to set ConEmuPrompt1=$E[92m$P$E[90m.\nThe clink header though, seems unrelated.. I've changed the task command to:\nset CHERE_INVOKING=1 & %ConEmuDrive%\\Cygwin64\\bin\\zsh.exe --login --interactive -new_console:nt:\"ZShell\"\nAnd I no longer get the Starting /bin/zsh message. But now the task takes a bit longer to launch on the Windows 7 machine. The Windows 10 one (with this new task command) is still fast it used to be.. Nevermind, it actually takes the same amount of time with either command.. Perhaps. It didn't occur to me to try that out...\nI changed the task to the other command with CHERE_INVOKING and it works nicely. The slowness was because my work computer is connected to the company's network with AD authentication (nothing to do with Windows7/10). There's a few Cygwin tweaks which fixed the issue for me :). Yes, Startup task, sorry for the confusion.\nI know the name, but if I change that name or the change the settings Startup task, that won't match the command and I'm looking for a way to always launch the startup task, no matter which one is set on the settings page.. The command I'm using (without the -run):\n\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" -here -cur_console:d:\"%1\"\nWhat I get:\n\n. If I don't, it doesn't open in the directory I want. I have this configuration in the Explorer context menu.. I configured it manually because I have multiple context menu entries with different options. But I looked how you were doing it in the \"Integration\" and I changed the command to:\n\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" -here -dir \"%1\"\nWhich is working as expected now.\nHowever, like I said, I have multiple context menu entries and one of those is an \"admin\" one which I need to have like this:\n\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" -here -dir \"%1\" -cur_console:a\nThis one doesn't work because of the -cur_console.\nHow can I have an admin context menu entry opening in the %1 directory?. Can you please be more specific? What do you mean with \"reuse\"?. But that's not exactly what I'm looking for. I want to have 2 entries in the Explorer context menu to open the selected directory inside ConEmu with the startup task by default. After your recommendations above I reached this solution:\n```\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Prompt.ConEmu]\n@=\"Open ConEmu Here\"\n\"Icon\"=\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\"\n\"SeparatorBefore\"=\"\"\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Prompt.ConEmu\\command]\n@=\"\\\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\\\" -here -dir \\\"%1\\\"\"\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Prompt.ConEmuElevated]\n@=\"Open ConEmu (Admin) Here\"\n\"Icon\"=\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\"\n\"HasLUAShield\"=\"\"\n\"SeparatorAfter\"=\"\"\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Prompt.ConEmuElevated\\command]\n@=\"nircmd elevate \\\"C:\\Program Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\\\" -here -dir \\\"%1\\\"\"\n```\nThis is working just fine but now I was looking for a way to get rid of the nircmd dependency. I can't use  -new_console:a because that requires a task to be specified.\nIn a nutshell, is there another way to launch ConEmu default startup task in elevated mode from a command prompt?. ",

    "erquhart": "I am now encountering this issue after upgrading to Windows 10. Using Windows 8.1 I never had an issue. I don't use KatMouse, Synergy or anything like them. Only the first split scrolls with mouse wheel - the others do not, regardless of focus. This is using the msysgit (Git for Windows 1.95.x) bash - other shells do not exhibit this behavior. The new version of Git for Windows (2.x) has way too many issues to make an upgrade worthwhile.\n. ",

Could be related.  I see the same results when I try to use PowerShell with the git --version and the above helloworld program.  However, if I do git --version > foo.txt in a regular (x64) command prompt, foo.txt contains the expected text:\n\ngit version 1.9.5.msysgit.1\n\nIn the same command prompt, helloworld.exe > foo.txt results in an empty file.\nTested in 150913.\nFor now, I'm going back to 150821.  Let me know if need more info or want me to do any other tests.\n. BTW, executing (git --version 2> $null) in PowerShell on Windows 7 x64 works.\n. This appears to be working now in build 151006.

Simply right-clicking the xbutton and disabling instantly allowed ALL panes in conemu to begin scrolling properly.\nEDIT:  I opened an issue with XBMC author here:\nhttps://forums.highrez.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3885\nAnd of note as I also stated there - this issue is the same whether the mouse events enabled in conemu or not, as well as whether the panes (any of them other than #1) are active or background.. I can report for those using XBMC (and other x-mouse type mouse enhancers) - I have performed additional testing which has confirmed a fix:\nChange the mouse message type to \"WPF Scrolling Msg\" as shown here:\n\nAny other mouse message type he uses (#1-4) render successful results but the WPF, when adjusted to 3 lines as shown above - shows un-noticeable difference in usability from any other window, so I could find no down-side in simply creating a new application profile in XBMC for the Conemu app and window class to simply always switch to the WPF method and it is working great!. This is very easily accomplished simply by enabling/ensuring the use of clink in Conemu options as an addon and change it's settings for history duplication accordingly.. Yes cmder simply executes conemu, in fact that prompt was open in only conemu (but I am customizing my prompt with lambda and powerline etc.).  I will continue testing but it sure seems to be in conemu and the weird thing is even in my video you can see sometimes it does properly blank the screen and redraw, then the next history hit it leaves artifacts.\nEither way as you can see - it is VERY messy and it's just Powershell in conemu I cannot be the only one having the issue but perhaps I'm just the only one that it so annoyed by it that I asked. :)\nDo you have any ideas or are you able to load up Powershell yourself and hit CTRL-R for reverse history search and search for like a \"#\" like I did and if you paste even a page long script into history it will then recall it and along with one or two single-line \"#\" comments in history, you should see the same thing.\nEither way thanks for looking into it!.

    "theficus": "I searched through the xml and found settings to configure the size of the splitter (Multi.SplitWidth and Multi.SplitHeight) but nothing for the color. Did I just miss something?\n. Great, thanks. I was able to tweak this through the .xml directly.\nIt would be great if in the future there was a UI to customize this and its color separately from the status bar.\n. Would it be possible to add a balloon clarifying this? It behavior doesn't seem consistent to me from a UX perspective; I would assume if I uncheck \"Inactive console Text Cursor\" that it would not show any cursor in inactive windows rather than inherit from the active window settings.\n. I don't have a problem with the name, and honestly I can't think of a better way to name it.\nWould you consider changing the design to using a three-state checkbox?\n- Checked: use the defined settings\n- Unchecked: no cursor\n- Third state: inherit from parent\nI'll see if I can think of a good way to word any balloon description.\n. Gotcha. In that case, adding another radio button for \"no cursor\" would probably solve this in the most elegant way I think.\n. \nHere's an example from my computer when dragging between two monitors. \n(Repros on 180422 and 180617). @Maximus5 I just installed the latest build (180617) and the same issue occurs. It's not clear in the screenshot, but the window becomes sized significantly smaller when moved from monitor A to monitor B (and significantly larger when doing the reverse). I didn't even notice the scrollbar clipping until now but yes, it's always on.. Ok, here's a better demonstration. The window on the left and the window on the right should be the same size but as you can see they are significantly different between the two monitors. If I were to drag the window from the right monitor to the left one, it will be the size shown in the ConEmu window on the left. If I drag the window from the left to the right, it will be the enlarged size on the right.\nLeft monitor is at 200% scale, right monitor is at 100% scale.\n\n. Also on 180411 here. It's not 100% consistent, but it does happen quite often. I tried on several versions of git -- 2.14, and 2.16. This did not happen on earlier builds. Commands like git pull, git push, git checkout can all hang. This does not happen in a regular cmd.exe window. \nDisabling conemuhk.dll injection seems to work around this.. ",

I experience the problem with Stable but not with Alpha, I haven't tried Preview.  I recommend using a more recent version to resolve this problem (Settings > General > Update > Preferred release type)\n. I think the idea is: whilst it's possible to create a repeatable split-screen configuration by specifying the heights and widths of each window, it would be useful to be able to capture that information for the current configuration, so it can be used to create a repeatable setup.  So if I've got one window at 60% on the left, and two on the right one above each other, it would be useful to have an option to \"Save current split-screen config\" so the application could tell me the numbers or commands to use to repeat it in future.\nOP: please excuse me if I've got it wrong. \n. I've tried with all the combinations of settings that seemed relevant in Mark/Copy and Paste.\nThis occurs on two separate laptops running Windows 10 Pro.. I'm using the {Bash::bash} task I found in ConEmu, I did not create my own task to run a WSL terminal in ConEmu.\nTroubleshooting:\n\nYes, full text makes it into the windows clipboard.\nThis is an old habit from Windows terminals, and you're right, it's not relevant to this behaviour.  Sorry.\nYes, contents are pasted fine into ConEmu64.exe -basic -run cmd /d with no loss of characters\n\nI've noticed the problem only seems to occur when the text being pasted contains spaces; the more spaces in the text, the fewer characters get pasted.  If I have more than about 3 spaces then usually nothing gets pasted.\nHere's an example of writing some text, then copying it and pasting once per line (pressing ctrl+c at the end of each line): \n\n. Update servers are working again so I've pulled the latest preview build (171109). (I wasn't able to run the file with my existing stable build, it complained about not having cygwin1.dll).\nI don't seem to have %ConEmuBaseDirShort% on my system, but putting that file in the Program Files\\ConEmu\\ConEmu instead and updating the task appropriately gets it running.  Pasting seems to work fine (including spaces) but occasionally the console locks up completely (doesn't accept any input from typing or pasting).  I don't know how to find that log file, but I do now have the wsl folder in there with some wsl* things I didn't have before.\nIncidentally, my clear screen macro works in there as well, so it seems likely the two problems are related.. Yes, I was reporting a bug in the latest stable build (161206).  The problem still occurs in the latest preview build (171109) as well.  Does the fact that you've closed it mean it's fixed in an alpha build?. Sorry, I rely on ConEmu so much for daily productivity that I'm generally not prepared to be running anything but stable builds.  This may be my own misunderstanding of what is meant by \"stable\", but I generally take the same approach with all of my critical tools; I'm already very uncomfortable running an insider version of Windows.\nAlso yes, I interpreted \"old builds\" to mean anything older than the latest stable build.\nI've tested this problem with both the latest stable and preview builds, and the problem occurs in both cases.  Only when running bash using the file you sent (above) was the problem resolved, but I experienced a far worse problem (freeze) which prevents me from using it.  Is this problem fixed in an alpha build?  . In response to your question about the connector, I've tried setting it up several times but have never understood the documentation enough to know what to do with it.  I found it difficult to understand what I need to download and where to put those things.  I also don't understand what it does.  For these reasons the minor benefit it got me (allowing me to list the directory in the tab name) didn't seem worth the couple of hours I've already sunk into trying to make it work (and often breaking my ConEmu in the process).. I've installed that version.  My {Bash::bash} task still looks like this:\n%windir%\\system32\\bash.exe -cur_console:pm:/mnt --login -i -new_console\n\nIt still has the problem.  I'm afraid I don't really understand what you mean when you say \"why don't you use the connector\" - I installed ConEmu and used the built-in {Bash::bash} task.  Does that not use the connector?  If not, that's why.  If it does, then I am using it.\nUsing the command line pasted above in a new, custom task fixes the problem:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --log --wsl -cur_console:pnm:/mnt -t bash -l\n\nI previously ran the file you pasted above in dropbox; this created the ConEmu\\ConEmu\\wsl folder, but  I don't know whether the build 171117 update I just installed changed that or not.. @deadalnix looks like it relates to #1314 (see this comment), use latest alpha build and ensure your task command looks like the one in the link @Maximus5 gave above; running bash.exe I think will still give you the problem, so you have to do it the way that link describes.. > This is what it is doing now:\n\n\nThis is what it used to look like:\n\n\nI have this same issue, it's very difficult to get readable output from commands like ls at the moment, without losing readability of other output..

The title bar doesn't resize, so its twice as big as it should be on the 1080p screen.  The size of the window doesn't change either but something is triggering the underlying window to rescale so thats when you get that message the original poster was seeing.

Tried Far Manager without ConEmu plugin, looks like tab with Far can be closed if plugin is not used.\nAlso tried ConEmu version 140404, this version did not have this problem\u2014with plugin and without plugin tab can be closed without problem.\n. Thank you.\n. ",

    "mikofski": "Sorry for posting on a closed issue, but I think this issue is also affecting me? Lately, at least since the past 2 updates without changing any settings, I cannot get the scrollbar to appear with mouseover. The only way I can get a scrollbar is by setting Main->Appearances->Scrollbar to show from the default auto or by turning the mousewheel, and then it appears most of the time, but not always, and if I'm fast enough, I can grab it before it dissappears. The other default, not sure if this is relevant, is Appearance->Size & Pos->pad size is 0, but changing it doesn't do anything for me.\nplatform: windows10\nconemu: 180422 alpha/preview\nshells: all (bash, cmd, sdk, helper, etc.)\nBTW: I really appreciate ConEmu. Thank you very much for this excellent console! I recommend it often.. +1 similar issue.\nvim --help and vim --version also don't work - show briefly, the clear.\nconemu has issues with vim msys2, git-for-windows, msysgit and vim.org\n- crashes for commit messages\n- segfault\n- can't write to _viminfo\n- can't get viminfo data, press enter to continue\n- tried deleting _viminfo, no effect\nconsole2 doesn't have any issues with vim.\n. Hi @Maximus5 \nsorry for my terse report, and sorry if this is the wrong issue for it, I found at least 2 others that seemed similar (#341 and #335 both seemed similar). I will try to acquire trigger a seg fault again and save the vim stacktrace  to report here. (MSYS2 seems to automatically generate these now)\nI will also try to figure out why the vim --help and vim --version output is being cleared, and look through the source to see if it can be redirected or captured for the main console. It doesn't persist in the \"real console\" either, but it does persists in CMD, mintty and Console2/Z.\nIMO ConEmu is still by far the best windows console emulator in existence and I am willing to help to make it work. I greatly appreciate your contribution! Thanks!\n. so far 151025 is working great for me. Thanks!\n- vim is stable with git commit\n- vim --help and vim --version buffers are preserved\n- git-for-windows git bash is automatically detected and added as c:\\program files\\git\\git-cmd.exe --command=usr\\bin\\bash.exe -l -i\n- msys-2_x86-64 is also detected automatically, but $MSYSTEM is not set - this should be set by the user depending on whether they want MSYS, MINGW32 or MINGW64.\n. @Maximus5 2 weeks of testing, not a single incident of either\n\ncan't write to _viminfo\n\n... or ...\n\ncan't get viminfo data, press enter to continue\n\nI vote to close this issue.\n.

    "raleksandar": "Thanks on quick response!\n1. I know that Cmder is 3rd-party repackage, I just like it's defaults better (and I'm too lazy to set them myself manually), but I do keep ConEmu's Update settings to 'Preview'. That should get me latest (stable-ish) version despite using Cmder package, right?\n2. I keep status bar hidden, but here's a screenshot with status bar on: \n   \nBut since this is apparently not a problem with ConEmu this issue can be closed and I'll go and report an issue at MSYS2 repo.\n. Well, I guess so, I've installed it via MSYS2's pacman package manager.\nI've just tried running it from Win+R it's the same as with ConEmu (so it's definitely not ConEmu bug). \nAlso I've checked encoding, active code page is set to 65001 and TrueType font is selected in \"real console\" (Lucida Console).\n.

    "amithegde": "Well, I tried it on two computers and it behaved in the same way. So I thought it would be better to get it fixed. Is there any special configuration I need to do to get powershell working on ConEmu?\n. Powershell works on the machine and is installed properly.\nAttaching an image. I start powershell on ConEmu by pressing powershell command, once I get a prompt, I type Get-Pro and hit tab. It doesn't show the command and doesn't let me type it manually or press escape.\n\n. never mind, it works fine on Win 10\n. ",
    "TravelingTechGuy": "Just to add another symptom: the console/s do not appear in my list of open windows (either Alt + Tab or Win + Tab), despite still appearing as a task bar notification icon.\n. I tried once, was far from impressed, and turned it off. Is that the root cause? How do I revert? Do I need to reinstall ConEmu? And why does the setting not allow turning it off/on?\n. Yes, got it. As I mentioned, I tried the Windows 10 tablet mode for a minute and turned it off.\n. Running with -basic does open a window that minimizes correctly to the task bar. If I share my settings XML, would that be something you could pinpoint? Or is it too complicated?\nI have no idea what I may have screwed up - but I thought the UI setting should allow me to change that.\nThanks for your time :)\n. Here it is. BTW. I saved the settings aside, reset them, and re-imported, and it looks like it's back to normal (not completely sure yet, but I see it in the taskbar).\nxml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"

I can add some more data to the issue: If I reset settings to default, the console returns to behaving normally (i.e. minimizing to task bar, rather than notification area, appearing in alt-tab screens). If I then load back in my settings, it works for a while, and then reverts to the bad behavior - despite my settings having <value name=\"AlwaysShowTrayIcon\" type=\"hex\" data=\"00\"/> as you can see above). Resetting it again works, etc.\nSo I think something is corrupting the settings somewhere. Hope this helps.\n. I don't remember turning it on. What does it do?\n. ",

Here's a link to my conemu settings:\nhttp://termbin.com/d4sq\nI can't seem find an option in the settings window to disable overtype though. Perhaps I am looking under the wrong name?\nSorry, I don't understand what you mean by \"Your gif do not depict cmd starting up.\".\n. Removing the \"-new-console\" but seems to fix it, thanks for the help anyway :)\n. Yeah, from the Task {cmd}. I also removed the /dir option from the \"task parameters\" section. \n. Overtype seems to be disabled now even when reverting the command & task parameters back to what I had before. I think it might be a global keyboard shortcut I pressed..... but I have no idea what it was. An option to change the overtype mode through ConEmu would be really good since when it is enabled, you have to press \"Insert\" every time you hit enter. This happens on a semi-regular bases too, so it would alleviate much frustration :)\n. Right ok.

I changed it to bash.exe and was hopeful that this would work, but I just got the timeout again, i.e it says \"Write failed: Connection reset by peer\".\nNow usually I would check the server and ssh configuration, but the point is that this doesn't happen with any other terminal app. Also when I connect from Linux or on on the Mac it doesn't happen.

    "DRSDavidSoft": "@Maximus5 since Clink is forked (the author's been disappeared), would you like to work on a smoother and better integration for it, since Cmder also incorporates ConEmu with Clink?. @Maximus5 Hey there, when I drag a file into a cmder (ConEmu) window, it replaces to the unix /cygdrive prefix. However, I've modified the /etc/fstab to \"mount\" the Windows drives inside /mnt/, like this:\n/mnt/c/Users/David/Desktop\nHowever, ConEmu doesn't use the correct path, but instead uses /cygdrive which doesn't exist.\nThis doesn't happen in mintty.exe, is uses the correct /mnt path.\nWhat should I do in order to fix this behaviour?\n\n\n. @Maximus5 Thanks for replying!\nHow would I call the cygwin.bat with the -new_console parameter? Is the switch being integrated into the below batch file correctly?\n@echo off & cd /d %0\\..\nset PWD=%~1\nset CMDER_ROOT=C:\\development\\cmder\nset CYGWIN_ROOT=C:\\development\\cygwin\nset BASH_COMMAND=pushd \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\" ^& \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\\bin\\bash\" --login -i -c 'cd \"`cygpath -au '%PWD:\\=/%'`\"; exec bash' ^& popd\nset CONEMU_SWITCHES=-new_console:m:/mnt -new_console:a\nstart \"Cygwin Shell\" %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe /icon \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\\bin\\mintty.exe\" /title Bash /loadcfgfile \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\ConEmu.xml\" /cmd cmd /c \"%BASH_COMMAND%\" %CONEMU_SWITCHES%\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1562#issuecomment-347924086. I think you misinterpreted the command line, I've used mintty.exe simply as the icon for the new tab:\n/icon \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\\bin\\mintty.exe\"\nThe purpose of the above batch file is load bash with the working directory set to a custom path %PWD%.\n(Yes I know the correct way to do this is -new_console:d:%PWD% and I should have probably used it instead of the workaround I'm using, but it would have then only worked in ConEmu and not Console2, so I decided against the switch.)\nIn fact, I see when the Bash task is launched in ConEmu, the -new_console:m:/ switch is used:\nset CHERE_INVOKING=1 & %ConEmuDir%\\..\\cygwin\\bin\\bash.exe --login -i -new_console:m:/cygdrive -new_console:C:\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\cygwin\\Cygwin.ico\"\n\nWhich means that as specified in the documentation, using -new_console:m:/mnt is the key!\n\nAnyways, thanks for your time! I really appreciate the work and effort you've put into ConEmu. I first encountered it on a stackoverflow answer you made a while ago, and since then I've fallen in love with it! :)\n\nI guess I should make sure to read as much as the documentation as I can, to avoid using it incorrectly like you mentioned.\nCheers!. related: #1652. I think we should use PNGs instead of BMPs here. @Maximus5 can this be achieved with a new variable in ConEmu.xml and using this?\nExample:\nSetWindowLong(hWnd, GWL_STYLE, 0);. @seriouz I should've checked myself before commenting. I thought ConEmu didn't have it since the issue was open since 2016.\nIt's obviously explained in the documentation: SettingsAppearance.html\nHere's how to do it:\n1- Press Win + Alt + P to open Settings\n2- From the left panel, click on Appearance\n3- In the section \"Title bar (Caption) and border options\" choose \"Hide caption always\"\n\n. This should be possible. Well, if you read AnsiEscapeCodes.html, and according to RenameTab.cmd it seems that the following escape code can rename the tab:\n%ESC%]9;3;\"<new_title_str>\"%ESC%\\\nYou want to rename the tab to the current working directory, so instead of <new_title_str> we can use %CD% (cmd.exe's current working directory variable)\nHowever, we want to echo this after each new command is executed, so we tie it to the %PROMPT% environment variable, and change %ESC% to $e and then change %CD% to $p (these are according to ConEmu and Windows cmd's documentation)\nAnd then we can prepend the result like this:\nprompt $E]9;3;\"$P\"$E\\%prompt%\nNow all you need to do is to run the above command at each startup for which you may add it to the end of the CmdInit.cmd file that ConEmu uses.\nSo you get this:\n\n(Notice that the diectory appears in the titlebar.). Interesting, thanks for introducing such tools to me!. @sl5net No, you're mistaken. Cmder is a terminal package created by using clink and extending ConEmu. While Cmder is built on ConEmu, you shouldn't ask @Maximus5 for help, because as he said, Clink changes how the prompt string is proccessed.\nYou have to actually consider the following issues:\n1- Cmder actually sets /title Cmder in ConEmu, which is a fixed title, as explained in #1521 by @Maximus5.\n2- Clink is a pre-processor for anything prompt related. The ESC ] 9 ; 3 ; \u201dtxt\u201c ST escape sequence is ConEmu-specific OSC, Clink can't understand it, and to make this work it should pass the sequence, which it does not.\nEven if you open ConEmu.exe from cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5 directory, it runs the ConEmu with Cmder-specific designed configuration file, which should not be considered vanilla ConEmu.\nYou have two options now:\n1- Download vanilla ConEmu from here without any additions (I've tested the sequence I gave you, and it works)\n2- Open a new issue at Cmder, and ask @Maximus5 to implement something like #1521, while we at Cmder would work to make sure Clink doesn't break ConEmu-specific escape codes.\nHope this helps! :). @Maximus5 Okay, I understand the goal is to be a fixed constant, but can it still be possible to pass a \"%s\" placeholder string to allow setting a portion of title?\nFor example, if I launch ConEmu with /title Cmder: %s as the title, it would then be possible to use #1472 to display the directory name in the title like this: Cmder: C:\\Users\\home\\Desktop\nI know it's technically possible, but would you consider it reasonable to implement? :). Can I rename this issue to \"[Feature Request] Templates support for window title\" and you reopen it?. related: gh-512. @Maximus5 You're right. As you said, the support for this variable seems to be limited mainly to macOS and cross platform terminals (e.g. Hyper).\nTerminals in support of TERM_PROGRAM\n| name | value |\n| :------- | :------ |\n| macOS Terminal | Apple_Terminal |\n| iTerm2 | iTerm.app |\n| Hyper 2 | Hyper (formerly HyperTerm) |\n| Terminus 1 | Terminus |\n| VS Code's integrated terminal 2 | vscode |\n1 Until recently, Terminus set the variable Terminus=1 instead of TERM_PROGRAM=Terminus (https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus/issues/702)\n2 VS Code and Hyper did not set the variable until someone asked (respectively https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23295#issuecomment-290672645 and https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/1186#issue-195380977)\nBenefits\n\nalthough not a standard, many terminal emulators on macOS implement this\nit's used by Yarn and neofetch to detect the terminal\nit's a quick and easy way to find the type of terminal from shell scripts (e.g. to be used here https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-escapes/issues/7)\n\nTerminals that do not provide TERM_PROGRAM\nRejections\n\nmintty: argue that \"such variables [...] are not only set in the child shells but also in any other terminal started from them.\" \u2013 https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/776#issuecomment-396681576\nalacritty \u2013 dismissed as a non-standard feature\n\nNot-implemented\n\nFluentTerminal \u2013 Another xterm.js-based terminal, pending discussion: https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal/issues/222\n\nUnknown/Un-tested\n\nTerminator \u2013 The GNOME's terminal emulator (Ubuntu, CentOS Linux and FreeBSD)\nTerminology \u2013 Another terminal emulator for Linux and BSD\nTermite \u2013 A terminal emulator for GTK+ (Linux, *NIX)\n\nPrograms that check TERM_PROGRAM\n\nYarn: uses TERM_PROGRAM to display emojis on Hyper and macOS terminals.

It's not specifically related to vagrant.\nI have a powershell script that calls git.exe and tries to process the output. When it's run in ConEmu the output (STDOUT) seems to be lost, i.e. null. This is probably how vagrant is testing the VirtualBox version. Since it cannot get output, it thinks virtualbox isn't working properly.\nRunning the identical script in cmd.exe / powershell.exe it works as expected.\nWhat's even more confusing is that I have identical versions of ConEmu (i have a portable install in dropbox) and this issue exists on my work Windows 7 machine, but not on my home Win 10 machine.\nI've also seen this issue on a colleague's machine as well.\nedit: my colleague is running windows 8.1\n. Because my steps are identical to those in the first post.\nAnother way to reproduce the error is to install the Posh-Git powershell module and then import it\nPS> Import-Module Posh-Git\nWARNING: posh-git requires Git 1.7.2 or better. You are using .\nthe relevant script is:\npowershell\n$requiredVersion = [Version]'1.7.2'\nif ((git --version 2> $null) -match '(?<ver>\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)+)') {\n    $version = [Version]$Matches['ver']\n}\nif ($version -lt $requiredVersion) {\n    Write-Warning \"posh-git requires Git $requiredVersion or better. You have $version.\"\n    $false\n} else {\n    $true\n}\nIt should be seeing 2.5.0.windows.1 but sees nothing. $version is never set.\nIf I execute the identical commands in a normal cmd or powershell window you don't see the warning message.\n. I upgraded to the same version of Git as you, just in case, then tried again:\n\n\nBoth are running as Admin, but I don't think that makes a difference.\nI tried simplifying things a bit more, ConEmu vs Standard Powershell. The final command fails in ConEmu, but not in cmd.exe.\n\n\n. Also just noticed you are running x86, and I'm running AMD64.\n\n. Also doesn't work\n\n. powershell\n(git --version)\nworks. So perhaps it related to the redirect\nedit:\n(git --version > c:\\temp\\text)\nabove works, so maybe something to do with STDERR stream redirects.\n.

As a side note, I was getting build errors, but they didn't impact the test though:\n2>     Creating library ..\\..\\Release\\ConEmu\\ExtendedConsole64.lib and object ..\\..\\Release\\ConEmu\\ExtendedConsole64.exp\n2>CmdArg.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __std_terminate\n2>CmdLine.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol wcspbrk\n2>CmdLine.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol wcschr\n2>CmdLine.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol wcsstr\n2>CmdLine.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol wcsrchr\n2>CmdLine.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol strrchr\n2>CmdLine.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol wcsncmp\n2>Common.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol memmove\n2>WObjects.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol wcstoul\n2>WThreads.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol strchr\n2>..\\..\\Release\\ConEmu\\ExtendedConsole64.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 10 unresolved externals\nOnly happens in release.\nLooks like the FAR project. Since I don't use FAR that would explain the lack of impact.\n. It's not just powershell, it's a bit more generic than that.\nVagrant is written in ruby, and you get the issue mentioned in the initial comment in a CMD shell.\n. Things appear to be working properly with 151006.\nI've also had an NVidia driver update.\n. You can resize it, but you need to use the bottom right corner \"gripper\" instead of the side of the window.\nThe minimize/restore key also works for quake (and it even says so):\n\n. ",

The driver version is 352.86. DL link:\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/85053/en-us\nI'm also downloading the latest video driver and will feedback whether it changes anything.\nUpdate regarding video driver:\nSince my laptop support hybrid graphics, I just tested uninstall nVIDIA driver completely and leave only the Intel integrated video. The problem was gone. After installed back the latest nVIDIA driver, it's back. So it definitely is related to nVIDIA driver, but only happens after a certain ConEmu revision...\n. Here are the files under the coprocomanager folder:\nC:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\coprocmanager\\detoured.dll\nC:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\coprocmanager\\nvd3d9wrapx.dll\nC:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\coprocmanager\\nvdxgiwrapx.dll\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation\\coprocmanager\\detoured.dll\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation\\coprocmanager\\nvd3d9wrap.dll\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation\\coprocmanager\\nvdxgiwrap.dll\nThe two detoured.dll are in the driver distro, the two nv*.dll fiiles are as .dl_ so need to be uncompressed, 7-zip can do it.\nChecked by sysinternal autorun tool none of these files are referenced in common startup location. However they are referenced in the registry.\nI've uploaded an archive of the above dll files and the registry export.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/ConEmu%20Crash%20nVIDIA%20files.7z\nI can also confirm that after renamed the two coprocmanager folders the problem was gone.\nI would like to try the simple callexit app but lacks of two dlls on my system. Although downloaded them from opendll.com still no luck as the dependencies have dependencies. Could you upload a static linked version?\n. No binary download for the CallExit 1.1 release...\ndetoured.dll is not loaded in any process. The other two nv*.dll files under the same folder are loaded in many processes but not explorer.exe. detoured.dll are their dependencies though.\n\n.

ConEmuHooks.cpp?\nYes, comment out line 1006 InitHooksCommon(); and the crash went off. Comment out other InitHooks didn't help.\n. After commented out line 549 hook of CreateProcessW the problem is gone.\n. Still the same problem.\n. Yes I saw that. The only change against your code is in the SetAllHooks function in the SetHook.cpp file.\n\n. OK, let me response in this way:\nAs long as CreateProcessW is not commented, comment other hooks in HooksCommon[] or add FlushInstructionCache in SetAllHooks() cannot eliminate the problem.\n. I just found that the turn off inject conemuhk workaround does not work fully. When it is turned off, I can open a msysgit shell without problem, no crash at all. But when typed exit or ctrl+D to exit the shell, sh.exe still crashed.\n. Please check here for the diff: https://github.com/kraml/ConEmu/commit/f321b0e8417732905c8a5bfd7e2579fcd571b049\n.

Not fixed either.\n. Here is the dump with 150821a COnEmuHk.dll.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump-150821-13648-150822110056.7z\nBTW, which way to dump? The one mentioned here http://conemu.github.io/en/CrashDump.html by set ConEmuReportExe=xxx, or the one mentioned here https://conemu.github.io/en/MemoryDump.html by Process Explorer? This one is dumped in the 1st way.\n. There are the two dumps. The were created from two separated CallExit.exe runs.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump.7z\n. The problem is, if the debugger console is opened, after pressed enter to continue, the process will keep crashing and asking for save a dump forever(for at least 100 times, I didn't go beyond that) but never exit.\nIf you need those dumps, they are here, I've taken the one for #1 and and first 3 dumps for #2.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump%20from%20same%20process.7z\n. Yes it crashed as expected.

Here comes the dump.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump-20150907%202311.7z\n. Yes, still crashing.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump-20150908%200857.7z\n. Crash.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump-20150909%201343.7z\n. No crash with ConEmuHk.150908f.dll.7z now. I've test callexit.exe, rustc, hprest and some msys2 commands, with both 64-bit and 32-bit ConEmu, no more crash now.\nAs for the dump you requested in this comment https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/272#issuecomment-138851772 , I would like to provide one but when I create dump from PE, I got a dialog that says \"Error configuring dump resources: system cannot found the designated file\", and the dump file is 0 byte. I never used PE to dump before so not sure whether I missed any required configuration on my system.\n. Here is the dump for callexit from cmd.exe instead of ConEmu.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump-150908-46504-150909214707.7z\nI created it by start callexit, find its PID from PE, then run comemuc /debugpid= and press ctrl+break to generate a full dump when the press enter message is on the screen.\n. The last g dll works ok, no crash.\nI do notice that when started from cmd.exe there are no NVIDIA coprocmanager DLLs attach with callexit.exe. But if start it directly from explorer windows by double click, NVIDIA is there. Here is the dump in such case, if you would like to look into it.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16148499/CEDump-150908-71028-150910202156.7z\n. I started cmd.exe by click the start menu button, type cmd.exe in the search box and press enter. I just tried find the cmd.exe file in explorer window under C:\\Windows\\System32 and double click it. In neither case no NVIDIA dll was loaded.\n. yep 150910 works.\n. ",

However, when I try to build in ConEmu/tccle, it crashes with the error \"hcac2.exe has stopped working\".\nhere is dump file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3t8621k367zd6o1/conemu.dump.txt?dl=0\n. \"Uncheck Inject ConEmuHK in Features can workaround this issue.\"\nHah!!  I missed this earlier comment from @kraml !!!\nAnd yes, this solves the problem for me... I think I can live with that!!!\n. Yes, I think so... I'll pursue this on GH-272\n. I will try these this evening, when I get home.\n. Well, these experiments were interesting, if not enlightening (at least to me) !!!\nSo first, I opened a stand-alone tcc session to follow the preceding instructions...\n\ncd \\ConEmu\nConEmu64 -basic -log4\nsetConEmuSleepIndicator=TITLE & c:\\tccle13\\tcc\n1. log files were created in \\ConEmu, but I'll hold off uploading them, to see if they are of any value to you.\n2. I then opened two other tcc's in new consoles in this session, and changed all of them to the same directories that I had in my failing example.\n3. There are not keyboard delays in any of those sessions!!! dammit...\n4. I went into settings and turned off ConEmuHk (I need this off at work, so my compilers will run; I may not actually need it here).  There were still no keyboard delays.\n5. Oh, there were no 'sleep' indicators on title bar\n\nI then opened my taskbar link which opens all terminals automatically - and the keyboard delays are still present in that session!!\nSince my current log files are from the non-troubled session, I assume they are not useful??\nI'll try adding -log4 to my startup script on the failing link, and see what happens...\n. Okay, -log4 worked in my troubled session.  I then typed a (delayed) command in two of the three consoles.  Here is the log file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ydc38m52utyymg9/ConEmu-input-6048.log?dl=0\n. Okay, I'll try with -log instead.  I only enclosed 1 log file, because only 1 log file was created!!  That was the entire contents of the directory.\nI'm not sure what -basic does; should I use that in my regular startup command?  I guess I'll try it and see what happens.\n. I ran my startup script with -log -basic; my actual starting command is this:\nC:\\ConEmu813\\ConEmu64.exe -log -basic /cmd @c:\\ConEmu813\\ref.files\\conemu.startup.txt\nwhere conemu.startup.txt is:\nc:\\tccle13\\tcc cdd C:\\home \"-new_console:t:Home\"\nc:\\tccle13\\tcc cdd C:\\Users\\ascender\\Downloads \"-new_console:t:Files\"\nc:\\tccle13\\tcc cdd C:\\notes \"-new_console:t:Notes\"\nand with this configuration, I still have the keyboard problem; interestingly, when I run this command, the log files end up in c:\\ConEmu813, rather than in a directory on my Desktop.\nHere are the log files:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/f3rrkqw9bj3qci9/ConEmu.logs.0827.zip?dl=0\nBTW, I installed ConEmu 813, to eliminate the issue of mixing dlls from different version, which had been mentioned in early posts on this thread.  The dll files are current in this installation.\n. Well, I tried out the current release (150910), but it still has the keyboard-delay problem... though the crashes are gone, fortunately. Sadly, I now have the same experience on both my home and work machines (with my first version, the work machine did not have the keyboard delays, even though more consoles were open).\nWith 150910, I tried both my startup script that I used previously, and I also tried a batch file based on your Example4:\n:: Remove line breaks after paste!\nstart \"ConEmu\" \"C:\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe\" /cmdlist ^|^|^| c:\\tccle13\\tcc cdd C:\\home \"-new_console:t:Home\"^|^|^| c:\\tccle13\\tcc cdd C:\\Users\\ascender\\Downloads \"-new_console:t:Files\"^|^|^| c:\\tccle13\\tcc cdd C:\\notes \"-new_console:t:Notes\"\nThis also opened all the windows successfully, but some (not all) of the consoles have the keyboard delay... that is very odd; in the above example, consoles 1 and 2 had delay, 3 did not. At work, where I had 7 consoles opened, some had delay and some didn't, but it was not every third window that was good, I checked for that. I didn't write down the numbers though...\nIf I open one console at a time, using the 'Create new console' menu item, all work fine.\nHowever, that defeats any reason for me to use ConEmu.\nLet me clarify: I've been using Console2/ConsoleZ for years now, and it works quite fine. I occasionally find a bug, which the ConsoleZ maintainer promptly fixes... with one exception.. several of us have been begging for an option to remember a session (with multiple consoles) and automatically open them all with one command. For some reason, he won't do this.\nThis is the only reason I looked at ConEmu, and I love that feature!!!! It works wonderfully, and is sufficient benefit (especially at work) for me to learn a new program... but only if it is usable.\nI NEED a fix for this keyboard delay!! It is not usable like this...\nI will of course, collect and submit any log files that may be of use to you...\n. Oh!!  Okay, I re-ran my previous command script and collected log files:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/x8zzatyozgaph0v/ConEmu.logs.0911.zip?dl=0\n. yep, old issue looks same as my issue.\nConEmu.xml is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jg4vhrxt1vmmh9c/ConEmu.xml?dl=0\nBTW, I installed by unzipping .7z file into empty c:\\ConEmu ... don't know if that matters, but anyway.\n. I'm looking over the old thread and trying things mentioned there...\nI can fix problem by adding to each line in startup script:\n*set ConEmuSleepIndicator=TITLE & \nbut then I have to answer the UAC question for every tab, which is a hassle.\nThen I tried\n\nset ConEmuSleepIndicator=TITLE & \non each line; at first, seemed like that worked, but after a few seconds the slow tabs slowed down again.\n\nWhat are you looking for in screenshots??  I can't really demonstrate the delay.  Do you want screenshot of every tab, or just a slow one, or which?\n. BTW, sorry about closing the issue earlier; I was confused by the two buttons 'close and comment' vs 'comment' ... I thought it would just close the window...  duh.\n. Where/how is the delay specified??\nI tried ConEmuSleepIndicator=TITLE on each line, but didn't see any indicators on any tabs.\nscreen shot:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dfcih8v0dt4s6dm/ConEmu.screenshot.jpg?dl=0\n. Sorry, I don't understand??   How do I utilize this option??  I tried\nset StartCreateDelay=1000\nIn Startup:EnvironmentVariables, but I don't think it did anything, consoles all opened immediately.\nCan I put at beginning of my command file??  I'll try that...\n. well, putting \n            \nin the .Vanilla section, right after ColorTableNN, did not create any delays between opening consoles; I'm assuming the units of this field are milliseconds... does it go in some other section??\nI also tried putting it after \"DefaultBufferHeight\" later in the file, no effect with either, and the keyboard delays are still present.\n. Okay, first, when I run ConEmu64 using your ConEmu.xml, the delay is not present... Cool!!!\nof course, the start directory and tab labels are not what is wanted, but that's not important now!!\nI'll test out the patch that you just posted, using my original .xml file, and collect your Info screen dump as well... be back in a bit.\n. Whoa!!!!!!!!!!!!  I went back to my original ConEmu.xml, and merely added your StartCreateDelay record immediately under .Vanilla record...\nAnd the delay is completely gone!!!  In all three tabs... I'm going to try adding some more tabs and test this some more...\nI'll also test with your new patch, and without the StartCreateDelay, to see what the patch does...\nbe back in a bit.\n. Okay, observations:\n1. with 150910a patch, if StartCreateDelay is removed from ConEmu.xml, the delay is still present.\n2. With StartCreateDelay present in the right place, and set to 1000 msec, delay is gone and program works fine... this is already something I am happy to live with, though I need to test on my work machine as well... at work I typically have 7 to 10 consoles that I need to start after a reboot, but a 10 or 15 second start time will not break my brain!!\n3. if StartCreateDelay is reduced to 1/2 second (0x1F4) though, the delay returns, so looks like 1 second is minimum delay on this machine.\nOkay, let me go collect the Info screen; I'm assuming you want this from a failing run...\n. Okay, here is Info screen on a run with 150910a patch, delay = 500 msec, six consoles open:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/aa7oodp2cg19ril/ConEmu.screen.0912.jpg?dl=0\n. YES!!  Oh yes... just tested at work, with 9 consoles open, 1000 msec startup delay... oh my!!\nThank you, this is soooooo Wonderful...\nIt would be slightly better if I could drop the startup delays, and I'll continue to assist in any way I can...\nbut you have already made my work day so much easier...\n. Excellent, yes!  That works fine, and makes it a fair bit easier to experiment with different values.  On my home machine, 800 msec works, 700 msec still has kbd delay.\nBTW, I also thank you for changing 'Apps-P' to 'Win-Alt-P' !!!  On one occasion, I had accidentally guessed what 'Apps-' meant, but didn't write it down, and could never figure it out again!!\n. Well, okay, but I made a reasonably determined attempt to search through your documentation menus, yet somehow never came across this page!!  In any case, I'm very happy with the explicit info...\n. Here they be:\nThe logs and screens are in two separate directories, with appropriate names!! \nWait, change of intent; disregard previous file, use this one:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zv03yivfb4i16nz/ConEmu.delay.logs.7z?dl=0\nI just noticed there was a separate logs directory on my desktop, as well as all of the other logs which were in c:\\ConEmu\n. Well, at work today, I installed 150913, set startup delay to 800 msec, opened up 9 tabs, and still had the keyboard delay; 1000 msec didn't fix it, nor did 1500 msec, but 2000 msec works fine.\nFrankly, that's not too surprising; many things run slowing on my work machine, even though it's a Core-i7 machine with a high-end SSD... \nOnce it gets started, though, all the windows work fine, keyboard and otherwise, so I'm happy with this!\n. Latest preview version that I see (on Preview download page) is 150813c, from two weeks ago.  Is there an actual recent preview somewhere?\n. Okay, I downloaded ConEmuPack.150813c.7z, which actually contained 150910a, has the same issue.\nCan you give me a shortcut lesson on how to collect the data that you want with ProcessMonitor??  I downloaded the program and ran it, and I'm searching the web for hints on how to trace processes with it... but during the day I can't spend time on this because it's at work, and things have been very hairy lately!!!\n. Okay, I'm not even going to try to figure out what the hell is going on...\nI can run either executable in c:\\ConEmu, and it says 150813c, but if I run my taskbar link, which is pointing to c:\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.exe, it shows 150910a... which I don't even have on this machine AFAIK...\nI'm too tired to worry about it.\nAnyway, I deleted the taskbar link and re-created it, then added my startup arguments, and everything appears to work for now...\n//********\nLater, more detailed, test results on Wednesday morning:\nUsing 150813c, with 2000 msec startup delay, 9 consoles at startup:\nno keyboard delays, no crashes on any apps (so far), no malfunctioning scripts.\nSo this version seems to run well for me.\n. Okay, seems as it might be working now with 151006\n.

Yes, I tested with Win-R, as well as executing tcc.exe from Explorer, as well as running from ConsoleZ.  ESET works in all cases, except with ConEmu, as I carefully and in detail described above.\n. Oh, to be more specific about the image that I included.  That is tab 5 of 9, all tcc/le consoles, running in ConEmu V160111.  They were all started using a auto-load script:\nC:\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe /cmd @c:\\ConEmu\\ref.files\\conemu.startup.txt\nWhere conemu.startup.txt contains:\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\home \"-new_console:t:Home\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\Users\\dmiller\\Downloads \"-new_console:t:Files\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\pluto_prog_1109\\scripts \"-new_console:t:Pluto Prog\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\SourceCode\\vci\\bcs_develop \"-new_console:t:bcs root\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\SourceCode\\vci\\bcs_develop\\Debug \"-new_console:t:bcs bins\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\SourceCode\\vci\\bcs_develop\\BandageCommServer \"-new_console:t:bcs src\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\SourceCode\\vci\\pluto_dev \"-new_console:t:pluto root\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\SourceCode\\vci\\pluto_dev\\arc_fw\\bld\\vc_cli_ble_test \"-new_console:t:pluto dev\"\nc:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc cdd C:\\logs \"-new_console:t:logs\"\n. huh... well, that's odd...\nI'm using straight vanilla ConEmu, extracted straight from the distribution file; I've made no changes at all to its configuration.  I also tried running ConEmu64.exe directly, rather than from startup script, and I tried ConEmu.exe rather than 64-bit, but still have all the same behaviors.\nI made a second run with entire window shown, in case something on the status bar might mean something to you.\nIs your tcc/le 64-bit or 32-bit??  I was using 64-bit, but might try 32-bit and see if anything changes.\n\n. Does ConEmu leave any traces in registry?  I was experimenting with ConEmu a few months ago (when we were having issues with commands crashing, etc); I wonder if something got left over there that changed anything??\nI noticed, for example, that \"Inject ConEmuHk\" is disabled, though I thought default was enabled??\n. Aha!!!  If I use 32-bit tcc/le, this problem does not occur; it only happens with tcclex64.\nHowever, it's still true that tccleX64 by itself does not have this issue.\n. Here's screenshot of working eset\n\n. Okay, here you go... I did the following:\n1. deleted HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\ConEmu to get clean ConEmu\n2. deleted c:\\tccle14x64\\4start.bat to get clean tcc/le (there are no other configuration options for it)\n3. ran: ConEmu -basic -cmd c:\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc\n4. typed \"eset path\" to see if I could edit the PATH\nHere is the result:\n\n. Whoa!!  Nevermind !!   Upgrading tccle to 14.00.6, did indeed solve this problem!!\nWow; they almost never update tcc/le any more; I'd stopped looking!  Thanks.\nYou can close this ticket, unless you have other tests you want me to run for anything.\n. okay, that article says for tcc/le: \"Just enable Inject ConEmuHk feature. ConEmu will maintain CD for you automatically.\"\nI verified that ConEmuHk is enabled, and the ConEmuHk64.dll file is present.  But it still doesn't work.\nWhat else can I do??\n. huh... no, neither of those work... \nI wonder why?  They worked in the past... I don't think I've changed anything on this machine...\n. Yep, I noted in a previous post that this was checked.\nI'll look into SetCurrentDirectory() issue...\n//************\nJust to confirm your comment about tcc, I re-installed tcc/le 32-bit V13.06.77, and both CD display and ConEmu reloading are working fine !!!  I'll try to pursue this further with JpSoft, though they generally are not supporting tcc/le any more...\n. I wonder what ramifications I'll face by going back to 32-bit tcc/le, as well as rolling all the way back to V13 ????\n. Well, I don't actually know which is key.... I still had the installer for tcc/le 32-bit V13.06.77, I re-installed it, and it works... I guess I can now try downloading current 32-bit version and see what happens.  I'll do that, when I get in to work, and post the results.\n. Okay, I installed tcc/le 32-bit V14.00.9, and it works fine.  CD updates on title bar, and closing/reopening ConEmu restores all consoles to the correct directories.  So this is clearly an issue with 64-bit tcc/le.\nIs there any reason, from a ConEmu point of view, that I shouldn't just stay with the 32-bit tcc/le ??  AFAIKT, it runs programs just as fast as the 64-bit version does.... will ConEmu x64 have any issues with tcc/le x32 ??  I know, in the past (2014 timeframe), I had some quirky issues with ConEmu x64 and tcc/le x64 (programs crashing and such), but I'm not seeing any of that any more anyway.\n. Sounds good.  We can close this ticket then.\n. ",
    "podshivalovdv": "Will try with Far Manager without plugins, thanks a lot!\n. Works well with Far Manager without plugins. \nSo strange. \nI've enabled the Status bar - it started to work with my existing FAR manger without any problems\nI've disabled the status bar - and it still works \nWill see how it will work in the future\nThanks a lot for the great tool!\n. It is the default plugin in Far Manager which is called \"emenu\" who is causing this problem.\nHow to reproduce:\n1. Open Far Manager within the Conemu\n2. Press the Context Menu button on your keyboard (or F11)\nIn few seconds you'll notice this \"shifting\" behavior in conemu. \nI have the same problem on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1\n. Hi! \nI'm not talking about hotkeys (if you mean this), I'm talking about normal typing. \nOr you mean something else?\n. I see, thanks for the explanation. \nI haven't ever seen that problem when I run kitty in a separate tab in ConEmu that is why I was thinking that it might be a problem with the \"Split window\" feature somewhere. \nThanks.\n. It seems that my problems were cause by the enabled option \"Features/Focus in child windows\"\nAs soon as I disabled it - my problem disappeared. At least for now. \n. Hi, here it is\n\nThanks.. ",

    "daguej": "I am also experiencing this issue when dragging between a 4K high-DPI display and a regular-DPI display.  Logs here.  Screens look similar to what @HnLn posted.\nWhat's strange is that ConEmu's non-client area (the titlebar) becomes huge on the low-DPI screen.  With every other app I've seen, the titlebar resizes to match the display DPI.\nRelated: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266(v=vs.85).aspx\n. I don't think this is a Microsoft problem; rather, it appears to be a quirk in ConEmu's DPI awareness implementation.\nI would expect ConEmu to behave like Explorer: when you drag an Explorer window from a high-DPI screen to a low-DPI screen, the window resizes to match.\nSee this video for an example: https://youtu.be/f3Gujt4cW9c (sorry for the garbage video of my monitors)\nIn the video, the lower display is a high ~200 DPI display and the upper monitor is a regular ~96 DPI display.  You can see that when you drag an Explorer window between displays with different DPIs:\n1. At first, the window is big because it is initially rendered for the high DPI display.\n2. Once the majority of the window has been dragged to the low DPI display, Windows sends WM_DPICHANGED.\n3. The window changes its size so that its physical dimensions on the low DPI screen (in inches/cm) resemble the dimensions it had on the high DPI screen.\n4. The window re-renders its contents at the new scale.\nConEmu does complete step 4 (the text in the terminal is rendered at the current display DPI), but it does not complete step 3 -- the window retains its pixel diminsion on the low DPI screen, which results in a huge window.\nAs a consequence of doing 4 but not 3, the row and column count of the terminal changes when you drag between screens.\nI'm not sure exactly what Explorer is doing that ConEmu isn't.\n. Hmm.. my apologies -- it appears you're correct.  Looks like Explorer is drawing its own titlebars, so that's why it works as expected.  It's absurd that the non-client area isn't automatically DPI scaled by the system.\nEven with ConEmu's Hide caption always, the window does not maintain its physical dimensions when dragging between monitors (ie step 3 from above).\nIt would be nice if ConEmu resized its window pixel size on WM_DPICHANGED so that the terminal maintains the same number of rows and columns.  I can deal with the stupidly large titlebar, but having my 80x25 character window stay 80x25 regardless of DPI is very important.\nSettings screenshot:\n\n. Enabling \"Treat font height as device units\" does not really help -- it only makes the text bigger.\n- With it disabled, high DPI screen is 80x25; after dragging to low DPI screen it is 150x52\n- With it enabled, high DPI screen is 66x21; after dragging to low DPI screen it is 133x43\nOn high DPI display:\n\nOn low DPI display:\n\nSize & pos:\n\nConEmuLogs.zip\n. From https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn280512(v=vs.85).aspx:\n\nUnlike the other awareness values, PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE should adapt to the display that it is on. This means that it is always rendered natively and is never scaled by the system. The responsibility is on the app to adjust the scale factor when receiving the WM_DPICHANGED message. Part of this message includes a suggested rect for the window. This suggestion is the current window scaled from the old DPI value to the new DPI value. For example, a window that is 500 by 500 on display A and moved to display B will receive a suggested window rect that is 1000 by 1000. If that same window is moved to display C, the suggested window rect attached to WM_DPICHANGED will be 1500 by 1500.\n\nLooks like WM_DPICHANGED gives you the recommended new pixel dimensions that would maintain physical size (in lParam), but the app is responsible for actually calling SetWindowPos or similar.\n. Babun uses mintty, which is only system DPI aware.  That means its window is using the less-than-ideal DWM raster scaling.\nCmder uses ConEmu, so it suffers from this issue.\nWindows 10's conhost (the built in command prompt) is the only app I've seen that actually does scaling 100% right.  Not only does it scale the contents of its windows, it also somehow scales the non-client area and system menu correctly!  It does this for both the command prompt window and the options window.  Everything draws at the correct DPI/physical size and looks perfect on high- and low-DPI screens.\n. Ah -- very exciting!  This means ConEmu can now render windows correctly on different DPI displays.\n1. Call EnableNonClientDpiScaling(hWnd) when the window is created.\n2. On WM_DPICHANGED, use lParam to call SetWindowPos so that the window maintains its physical dimensions.\n. @Maximus5 I started hacking on this issue in a branch.  I have EnableNonClientDpiScaling working and resize the window so it maintains physical dimensions when dragged to a monitor with a different DPI.\nHowever, after dragging, the non-client metrics of the window change (since the titlebar and window borders are now different pixel sizes).  This results in things being positioned incorrectly since it does not appear to account for the new metrics.\nFor example, the window on the main high DPI display:\n\n(a 200dpi window -- 1,190 \u00d7 937 px)\nWhen dragged to a low DPI display:\n\n(a 96dpi window -- 594 \u00d7 468 px)\nNotice that on the high DPI display, the tab bar is 60px from the top of the window since the titlebar is 60px tall.  However, on the low DPI display, the tab bar is still 60px from the top, even though the titlebar is now only 30px tall.  Additionally, the tab bar should resize to render at the new DPI.\nI spent a little time fiddling around, but I couldn't figure out how to get the window to re-render at the new DPI.\nAny ideas how to make that happen?. Thanks for the comments on that commit.  I've made some adjustments and opened a PR (#1014) so we can do proper review.. Ah -- I'm on Insider build 14361.\nInterestingly, the cursor only disappears if the width of the window changes.  Changing only the height does not have any effect.\n. Appears to be fixed on Windows build 14371.\nThanks for investigating.\n. Can confirm working.. ",

I appreciate that. Thank you. I'll chalk it up to the difficulties of communicating via text.\n. Based on its description, including what's in the documentation, I would expect it to increase the size of the font when the window size is increased and decrease it when the window size is decreased. This is not the behavior I'm seeing, however. When attempting to change the size of the window, the number of columns is changing, and it's only ever possible to decrease the number of columns. Is this truly the expected behavior? Perhaps some clarification on how the feature is intended to work would be useful.. @Wulfex Do you have \"Auto-hide on focus lose\" enabled, by chance?. I have to agree with @ScottBeeson. The Quake-Style-Slidedown hotkey is currently controlling two separate boolean states:\n Conemu is open (not minimized to the tray).\n Conemu is in focus.\nI would personally prefer that it control only the open/minimized state. I normally work in a multi-monitor configuration. I may be doing work on another monitor and find that I wish to hide ConEmu so that I can see the windows under it. To do so, I must hit the hotkey twice, and endure a jarring flash as the ConEmu window disappears before sliding down again while it's brought into focus.\nTo state this in a standard feature/bug request format:\nSteps to reproduce (Requires Multiple Monitors):\n1. Ensure that the \"Quake style slide down\" feature is enabled on the Main > Quake style page.\n2. Open a program of your choosing on the monitor where ConEmu is/will open.\n3. If use the Quake hotkey to bring ConEmu into the foreground.\n    * note: This may be considered the \"starting state\" for reproducing the issue.\n4. Set the current focus to a program on another monitor.\n   * note: At this point, the user has decided that they wish to view the program opened in step 2.\n5. Use the Quake hotkey, with the intent to minimize ConEmu and allow the program opened in step 2 to be seen.\nExpected behavior:\n* The ConEmu window slides up, out of the way, and the desired program is visible.\nActual Behavior:\n The ConEmu window disappears for a brief moment, then slides down from the top of the screen; the ConEmu window now has focus.\n The hotkey must be pressed once more to minimize the ConEmu window.\nWhile I can certainly see the utility of a key that would bring focus to ConEmu, it believe it would be more intuitive, and more useful for multi-monitor users, if this was a separate hotkey. I've briefly tried the \"Auto-hide on focus lose\" option, but found that unsuitable, as I may wish to have the ConEmu window remain open while I do work on another monitor.. I do not. That's an interesting thought, but I don't believe it fits my workflow. I generally like to know that the terminal is going to be on my \"main\" monitor; also, a couple of my monitors are different sizes than the rest, which could make things awkward. I'll give it a shot for a while, though, and see how it feels.. Just wanted to report back on the \"Restore to active monitor\" option. I tried it for a while and found that it didn't serve the purpose of this request.. Yes. I believe I am. I guess I should have checked pull requests along with searching the issues list.\nThanks for the speedy update.. My mistake. I closed thinking it had been implemented already.. I can no-longer reproduce this issue; I'll re-open with logs if that changes. Thank you.. ",
    "youk": "@Maximus5 Why won't you learn some manners and language? Your communication style is plain rude. It might be okay where you come from, but it is not what people consider polite in the Western world.. The crash dump created by ConEmu contains private information. I will not be sharing it in public unless there is a way to strip the unwanted data. If you cannot reproduce the issue, I will think of creating VM and installing ConEmu and Far Manager there.\nI suppose by the authors you mean Far Team? As you might know, these guys are notoriously arrogant. It is of little use to discuss anything with them. Especially in this case, when Far itself works fine and it is ConEmu that causes failure.\nBy \"breaking changes\" I meant the internal changes that cause third-party software to malfunction. I don't think Far Manager developers have any obligation to provide APIs or SPIs. There is nothing to complain here.\n. I was not able to reproduce the issue on the clean installation. However, I was able to track down the source of the problem on my working configuration. It is the contents of Folder History. After cleaning it ConEmu stopped crashing. It is yet not clear what caused it to crash: a particular entry or history size by itself. History.FolderHistory.Count setting had the default value of 1000.\n. I figured out what causes ConEmu to crash. It is the length of Folder History items. For example, I have the width of the console configured to 178 characters. ConEmu crashes when there is an item of 170 characters or more. Folder History dialog is able to accommodate up to 169 characters (it expands its width). After the dialog takes up all the width, Far Manager's behavior is to trim too long items using the \u00bb character. It seems that ConEmu cannot handle this.\n. I made a minimal history.db which can be used to reproduce the issue. The key is presence of a long entry that needs to be truncated (169 characters or more) while the total number of entries exceeds 35. Then ConEmu crashes upon opening Folder History. It stops crashing once at least one entry is removed or the long one made shorter.\nPlease note that the console size is 178 by 48. Folder History looks like this (edge case before it starts crashing):\n\n. The issue disappeared starting with the version 170316. I can only assume there were changes in that version related to the cause of crashing.. ",

    "mbikovitsky": "@Maximus5, I'm not familiar with the codebase, but why not let Windows handle the snapping instead of doing it manually? Seems to me this is one of those things Microsoft does not want developers doing programmatically.\n. Assuming the inability to programmatically invoke snapping is by design (I'm not a Microsoft employee, so I don't know for certain that this is the case), wouldn't it be best to let Windows handle it and document that you can't do it manually?\nRestoring position, however, might still work. For instance, on my system the top-left corner of the screen is at (-7, 0), and when setting this position from the Settings screen the window moves correctly. Still, this isn't \"true\" snapping.\nAlso, when I disable the title bar, snapping still works when using the mouse to do it.\n. These are all valid points, but what I'm saying is that perhaps the solution is to make snapping work correctly where Windows allows it, and document that it is unsupported for the rest of the cases. Better to have a feature that works in some well-defined cases, than a feature that half-works in all cases.\n. ",
    "miniksa": "Hey @Maximus5,\n@bitcrazed, our PM, found this SetWindowPos issue being discussed on Twitter the other day and filed it as a bug in my system. I followed up with the team responsible for rendering window placement and got the following answers to some of your questions:\n- Is it a confirmed bug? Is it a feature?\n  It's somewhat in the middle. I asked the team responsible for the window framing and they said they consider the invisible frame to be By Design. I personally believe by some technicality, the frame still exists but is just invisible for theming/styling reasons, so they don't consider it a bug exactly. \n- Is there any workaround to put the window at the edge of the monitor working area?\n  This is where I got you an answer. :) The team says that you can use the DwmGetWindowAttribute function (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa969515(v=vs.85).aspx) with the parameter DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS to find the \"visual rect\" of the window as known to the window manager. A little calculation between that RECT and the one you already have for your window will let you know how many invisible pixels there are outside your bounds and let you compensate accordingly for the invisible border.\nI hope that helps you out!\n--Michael\n. @Maximus5 I've filed it as MSFT:9751066 internally and assigned to myself. I'm currently in a deep thought on something else, so I'll probably get to it early next week. Thanks for the report.\n. I see the issue. There appear to be duplicates coming out of ReadConsoleOutputW/A. I'm not sure what happened there. I'll have to keep investigating, but it looks like it will need a fix on our side once I figure it out.\n. FYI, I haven't forgotten about this investigation. We've just suddenly got slammed with e-mails and bugs from all sources and so getting to investigating this may take me significantly longer than I originally predicted. I will be back when I get a chance.. FYI, the fix for this should have just landed with Insider Build 15014 today.. Hmmm. Not sure what's up. I'll dig into character handling stuff today.. Yeah, I was finding bad behavior like this yesterday as well. Part of the deal is that it behaves differently with Raster Fonts vs. TrueType fonts as well. I'll probably be spending the rest of the week on trying to fix this up and make it consistent. I don't know what SM_DBCSENABLED is/does. Console's DBCS check has always been based on the active code page (is equal to 932, 949, 950, 936) not that system metric.\nI'll try to keep you posted as I figure this out. Sorry about that. A few of us have been working on trying to fit UTF-8 support into the console (not done yet) and it appears to have messed up quite a few DBCS routes.. I'll have to get back to you on that. Everything you are telling me about SM_DBCSENABLED is 100% new information to me. I don't really know if that particular metric used to be a part of the console code in XP/Vista/7/8. I can look. I also don't know what in the system turns that metric on or off.\nFrom what I know about the console from Win 8.1 to today, the console always did its conversions and width calculations based on code page. It's just that prior to recently, it used to prohibit changing into a CJK codepage unless your system's non-Unicode region was set to a CJK language (Control Panel-->Region-->Administrative-->Language for non-Unicode programs). I've been trying to remove that restriction to allow anyone to swap into any codepage no matter their \"non-Unicode region\" because in today's editions of Windows (as opposed to the CJK-specific ones of the 1990s), you can add just about any language pack and IME and font to any language edition of Windows, so the \"non-Unicode\" region doesn't really matter like it used to several decades ago.\nMy plan is:\n- Go back into the DBCS tests and expand them significantly across these APIs against the v1 console (legacy) since everything was \"fine\" before we mucked around with it.\n- Correct anything in v2 that is no longer compliant with the DBCS tests (including all the APIs you listed above).\n- Get that set of fixes and tests shipping up toward the insiders build.\n- Get you some documentation/research on how all this is supposed to work (including that SM_DBCSENABLED flag in the console context) and potentially get that sort of information published to MSDN.. So I've got through 1, 2, and 3 in MSFT: 10187355 which is checked in and will start shipping up to Insiders builds. Probably be there in a few weeks. I've basically restored the console's behavior to the same as what it was for the legacy console. If it works against the console with the legacy box checked, it will work again against the updated one once the Insider build updates.\nFor part 4, I'm still working on it. I basically need to write up the way that the v1/legacy console did it and publish that. . Hey @nta, @Maximus5,\nI have an active bug right now related to the console trying to paint when it's been set to SW_HIDE with ShowWindow (or via the STARTUPINFO structures that set hidden/shown). It's MSFT: 10248233 and set for the Creators Update release. If this window is hidden with SW_HIDE, then I'm already working on a fix. But I'll check down our other shown/hidden code paths as well when I go through this bug in case it's getting triggered another route.\nIt will probably be a few weeks before this makes it out in an Insider build. I'll try to bump this thread when I get the fix checked in and it starts percolating up the source tree to main.\nThank you very much for the report!\n--Michael\n. Hi guys, I'm pretty sure this bug ended up being MSFT: 10243950 which was an issue with a runaway WM_PAINT message with ValidateRect in the console paint loop. That bug's fix is almost out to the insider branch (probably in the next week or so) which should resolve this issue.\nThanks,\n--Michael. This didn't make 15014. It should be in next week's build.. I'm not able to reproduce this issue on a clean x64 VM of 15002.rs_prerelease.170102-1700.\nI also couldn't find any records of bugs/issues logged against the performance counters code behind RegQueryValueExW nor do I see any recent changes to that code.. I looked again at the dump and it's very strange. \n0:006> uf advapi32!PerflibciSetObjectsValidityState\nadvapi32!PerflibciSetObjectsValidityState:\n 2194 00007ff9`3d9d6d18 0000            add     byte ptr [rax],al\n 2194 00007ff9`3d9d6d1a 50              push    rax\n 2194 00007ff9`3d9d6d1b c3              ret\nHaving only 3 assembly instructions for this function (after looking at the source it is generated from) doesn't make any sense and makes me suspect something on @asser-dk's system has tampered with advapi32. \nIn comparison on my 15014 system, calling uf on the same function gives me 50+ assembly instructions, not 3.

But that's not where the heaps are with !heap and it's not inside any library or valid address space with !address. So if it's trying to write to invalid memory for no particularly good reason, that's why we hit an access violation. \nBut reading the source code for this function... there is no write operation that should be occurring immediately on entry to PerflibciSetObjectsValidityState. It should have grabbed its parameters off the stack, checked that the lock variable was not null (read access), and then jumped immediately to kernel32!WaitForSingleObject on the lock value it just checked. \nSo I further suspect something has tampered with advapi32.dll.\nBitDefender could be a good suspect. AntiVirus applications commonly place hooks inside system DLLs and detour them. Perhaps this was a bad detouring of advapi32 or a hook/detour that can't compensate for some compiler/linker update that adjusted the layout of advapi32.dll.\nSo as of now, I don't really have anything to file unfortunately as it doesn't look like a race condition at all to me. It looks like some other piece of software on @asser-dk's system is tampering with system DLLs and that's not something we support. If it happens on a clean machine or another machine where we understand the full state of everything installed to reproduce it (so it can be proven that the system is at fault), I'm happy to file an internal bug and pass it along. @maximus5, you're not seeing this at all on your machines, correct?\n. There have been a lot of Ctrl+C bugs in the console lately. We've been fixing them, but our feature branch is unfortunately a few weeks ahead of the code in the insiders branch. @Maximus5, you shouldn't spend too much of your time debugging/working around problems in 15002 or 15007. There's lots of known issues we fixed and are making their way up.. In before someone reports this is still broken in 15014.....\nThe fix for WM_KEYDOWN problems in general is still a few weeks away.\n@Maximus5, can you tell me exactly how you are emulating Ctrl+C WM_KEYDOWN (like the exact SendMessage/PostMessage structs you're giving us)? I want to stick your use case into our test pass if it's different from what's already in there.. I also have to sacrifice a goat to make Windows Update work properly on my machine sometimes. :P If you can get the Windows Insiders ISO, sometimes it's easier to clean install or upgrade install with that using the setup.exe on the disc image. \n@Maximus5, using SendMessage should be fine for the majority case. If it always used to work, we should make an effort to keep it working. We're writing tests right now to simulate various SendMessage keys like that anyway, I'll make sure your case is in there as well. The lag might have something to do with the miserable locking mechanism inside the console, but there's not a ton I can do about that anytime soon. Re-working the locks to be more reliable is on my backlog but keeps getting out-prioritized by other stuff.\nRegarding GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent, I agree it probably should act the same as pressing it on the keyboard. I'm not sure whether it's intentional or a mistake that the API doesn't release the ReadConsole wait handles. I'm also not sure whether fixing it will cause a compatibility nightmare elsewhere with someone who now relies on the existing behavior. :( I'd have to think about it and dig in a bit. I doubt it is a problem, but I've said that about other things in the past and they bit me later. :P I filed MSFT:10626321 to my backlog to make sure that I think about it at some point in the future.. Filed internally as MSFT:11150442. We'll triage and investigate.. @Maximus5 which dialog controls framework are you using? I can file the bug to that team.. Filed internally as MSFT:14257822. . The issue is that you're using characters that have a variable column count depending on the font. We continuously make improvements to these sorts of things, but there are a lot of characters and fonts in the world. We'll get to looking at this.. The same thing is happening for me with \u304b in ConEmu. The cursor positions in the bottom right corner of ConEmu are skipping by 2 when using left and right arrow keys as is expected for two-column width fonts, but the drawing of the cursor in ConEmu seems misaligned.\nEven when I set the console to the legacy console mode and with codepage 932 and paste in \u304b characters, the cursor drawing in ConEmu seems misaligned even though the column count in the bottom right is correct and skipping by 2 as I use the left and right arrows.\nI think this is a ConEmu issue in calculating the correct position for drawing the cursor. From what I can see, ConHost is reporting the correct number of columns for the characters when it can based on the font it has selected. It is also showing the cursor in the correct position in the underlying ConHost window when you open it with Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space.. I don't really understand the steps to reproduce this. If you can get a reliable set of steps, I can log a bug internally and try to figure it out.. I can reproduce this on my box with your steps without using ConEmu. Tried it out this morning. But oddly this only happens with the Bash window. I wonder if the shell inside the WSL environment is getting the \"window resize\" message and moving the cursor in response causing us to draw in the wrong spot. I can't get it to repro in CMD or Powershell. I'll have to attach a debugger to find out.\nI filed MSFT: 12092729 internally for investigation. With the Windows Insider Bug Bash last week, we have a high volume of bugs right now. It might take up to a few weeks for me to get time to investigate this.\n. OK, I got some time to look at this and figured a few things out.\n\n\nThe issue where when you resize the ConEmu window, the bash command line ends up wrapping early or no longer being aligned with the window frame. This appears to be the primary issue described above.\n\n\nThis manifested itself mainly as the Bash input line redrawing on top of itself. It would make it some/most of the way across the window, then the cursor would carriage return onto the beginning of the same line and start drawing on top of itself.\n\nThis one had no real work around other than resizing the window back to the size it originally was, so I made a fix for it.\nIt turned out that we weren't sending enough messages to the WSL subsystem to let it know that the window and buffer were being updated and it needed to relay that information into the WSL environment. That means you could get into a scenario where Bash inside WSL environment was told that the buffer changed, but not that the window changed (or vice versa) and it would wrap early or late and emit the wrong VT sequences for what it was trying to do.\n\nThis fix should be coming to Insiders builds in the next few weeks and has been encompassed in the 12092729 bug I generated above for investigation.\n\n\nThe issue where when you have a Bash input line full of stuff, you resize the window with Word Wrap/Reflow resize on (in the \"real console\") and suddenly the Bash line is reprinted above/below where you expect it, sometimes leaving extraneous characters behind.\n\nThis one seems to be because Bash doesn't expect the terminal to reflow text in the way that we do. It repaints its entire prompt line and everything you wrote on it after every change/modification. If the reflow moved it to another line because there was space, it can break some of Bash's assumptions and it will then repaint strangely and differently.\nThe workaround to this one is to just clear the screen after reflowing or disabling reflowing in the real console. Everything should be fine from there on out. \nOne of my co-workers has a long term task filed to investigate if we can make Bash and other utilities like this play nicer with the Word Wrap/Reflow resize, but that's not a simple bug fix like part 1 above (we never considered that in our original design, so we'll have to go do some experiments and potentially go back to the drawing board.)\n\nThanks for your patience with this and thank you for reporting this issue!\n--Michael. Hi Maximus,\nThere's not currently a way to programmatically adjust the reflowing setting. You can adjust it with the LineWrap REG_DWORD key under HKCU console before starting a console session (for those that load from the registry), or you can UI automate it off the property sheet... but there's no API or anything nice like that right now. :( \nWe have some people trying to figure out a comprehensive update to our settings story and exposing the difficult-to-set-settings is one of the things included in it, but I have no promises on timeline.\nSorry it's so obtuse. You might have to resort to a creative workaround in the meantime. \nThanks,\n--Michael\n. I've filed MSFT:12339782 to take a look at this when I get a chance to see if there is anything I can do.. Did a little bit of digging around. There was an issue MSFT: 11561936 where resizing the console window smaller while in traditional mode (word wrap/resize is set to OFF) would lose some of the color attributes. I fixed that one a few weeks ago and it is on its way out to Insiders.. Yep, sorry. Progress is slow but steady on the console host window and this is definitely on the list of things I have to solve at some point.

We'll get to it. Thanks for the report.. I tried the code in https://github.com/Maximus5/ms-bug-2 on Windows 10 17039 (in my team's branch, not RS_PRERELASE) this morning with the v2 console and it doesn't repro. Is that what you wanted me to check?\n. No, there is no way to trigger a paste event from the outside in a 100% reliable manner. \nWe've been investing effort into letting wrappers/host applications use ConPTY to become the hosting environment instead of further building out the console client API. If you use ConPTY to host things, then you event and handle the paste in whatever manner you choose and inject the results into the PTY input stream.\nAlso, there's no secret WM for paste. We just process Ctrl+V under certain conditions as a paste, but only when it's coming down our window procedure, not via the input queue API.\nThere actually is a WM_PASTE message, but we're not using it at this moment.\nFinally, if whatever shell you are using at the end of the pipeline decides it wants to treat the tab character as an auto-complete, then it will. In this case, it might be CMD.exe is buggy. But there's virtually no chance of fixing CMD.exe given that every time we change anything \"minor,\" it turns out to break half of the world.. Honestly I don't have the capacity to look at this right now. I just got back from vacation and I'm flooded with much higher priority issues that appear to be impacting a larger number of customers. \nIf @bitcrazed can get it to repro internally and can file a bug, I can queue it. But otherwise, this doesn't look to be widespread enough for me to investigate right now. Sorry.. I think this was MSFT:17318493 (\"Can't set custom title from ConEmu\") that our internal selfhosters identified but we didn't get fixed before the Insider Build went out. (There are a lot of Windows developers that use ConEmu!)\nAccording to payload tracking, it's in my parent branch which is slated to go up toward main today. It should be another week or two and it will make it out to the Insiders Fast builds.\n. @zadjii-msft, can you look at this?. @zadjii-msft Can you check if this has to do with your virtual bottom changes?.

    "RReverser": "@Maximus5 I thought I was still running into this issue on Quake mode (and I've been using ConEmu for years now), but, on a fresh setup, decided to give it another go, and only after finally reading through various discussions almost accidentally found out that it goes away if I:\n\nSet window width to 100% (this is understandable part).\nSet  Quake Style -> Frame width from -1 to 0 - this is also sort of understandable, but maybe worth specifically highlighting in docs?\nAfter that you need to slightly drag the quake ConEmu window after which frame does disappear.

    "leycec": "Let's do this.\nAn Ideological Divide\nIn the early 2000's, an ideological spectrum referred to by the two antipoles \"deletionism\" and \"inclusionism\" erupted on Wikipedia. Ironically, this bitter feud received sufficient media attention to be included in Wikipedia:\n\n\"Deletionists\" are proponents of selective coverage and removal of articles seen as unnecessary or highly substandard... Deletionists favor objectivity and conformity, holding that \"Wikipedia is not Google,\" a \"junkyard,\" or \"a dumping ground for facts.\" They argue that the interest of enough people is a necessary condition for article quality, and articles about trivial subjects damage the credibility and future success of Wikipedia. They advocate the establishment and enforcement of specific standards and policies as a form of jurisprudence.\n\"Inclusionists\" are proponents of broad retention, including retention of \"harmless\" articles and articles otherwise deemed substandard to allow for future improvement... Inclusionists may argue that the interest of a few is a sufficient condition for the existence of an article, since such articles are harmless and there is no restriction on space in Wikipedia. Favoring the idiosyncratic and subjective, an inclusionist slogan is \"Wikipedia is not paper.\"\n\nObserve the use of such words as \"conformity,\" \"enforcement,\" and \"jurisprudence\" in describing deletionists. But what sort of human might be attracted to words like that?\nThe Deletionists Have Won\nYes, that sort.\nTo paint with an admittedly wide brush, deletionists are both fundamentalist and conservative (in every categorical sense of those adjectives); inclusionists are not. Since spoken language is inherently subjective, however, there exists no unbiased means of quantifying which articles satisfy the deletionists' necessary condition of \"...the interest of enough people\" and which do not.\nGiven that, deletionism is inherently biased towards maintenance of status quo topics \u2013 which, in my concerned opinion, is antithetical to our continued accumulation of knowledge as a species. Unfortunately, at least with respect to open-source software, the deletionists have won.\nThe War on Open-Source\nI can hardly count the number of open-source projects with Wikipedia pages that either were successfully deleted or are currently flagged for deletion. The reason why is simple: Wikipedia's notability requirements for software articles are sufficiently draconian that effectively no open-source software meets them. These requirements can be synopsized by the following catechism:\nIf Google books, Google news, and Google scholar yield no hits for your project, your article will be deleted.\nThen let us query:\n1. Is ConEmu sufficiently complex to require the publication of for-profit dead-tree books disseminating its use?\n   - No, of course not.\n2. Is ConEmu sufficiently mainstream to incentivize the scrutiny of for-profit mass media television or newspaper outlets?\n   - No, of course not.\n3. Is ConEmu sufficiently academic to warrant the publication of for-profit peer-reviewed papers formalizing its theory?\n   - No, of course not. (Yes, Elsevier and related academic publishers are highly profitable. Let us ponder the ethicality of privatizing a common good payed for purely by taxpayer dollars. But I digress.)\nOf course, few to no open-source projects ever have or will meet such ludicrous eligibility requirements.\nThe size of your userbase is irrelevant. The number of daily downloads, frontpage hits, blog posts, or tech articles vis-\u00e0-vis your project is irrelevant. All that matters to the garden-variety Wikipedian is: \"Do members of the for-profit intelligentsia profit from and therefore formally discuss your work in a publicly monetized setting?\"\nIf not, you're going to have a hard time. Hence, open-source software has a hard time. Hence, Wikipedia has become effectively castrated with respect to open-source software.\nOn the bright side, nature abhors a vacuum. By ceding all of the informational territory on open-source software to the vacuum of /dev/null, Wikipedia has made it trivial for competitors with less rigidly doctrinaire policies to capture their readership. (Let us pray to Stallman this happens soon.) \ntl;dr\nDue to a dysfunctional culture of fundamentalist zealotry, Wikipedia fails with respect to open-source software. There's little to nothing we can do about that. Best of luck, Maximus5 and cohort.\n. ",

I can reproduce the issue with this oneliner:\ni=0; while [[ $i -lt 1000 ]]; do let i++; echo $i; done; vim\nUsing the same width and height, especially of the buffer (999 lines) it will run fine in the Windows Console, but will crash consistently in ConEmu. \n\nHow I can avoid ConEmu crashing\n- Decrease the buffer. The standard (1000 lines?) is too high, setting it to 300 will not crash ConEmu on vim startup. 500 will also crash ConEmu. I have not tried bisecting the problem space to find the cutoff point, but it seems obvious that it is between 300 and 500 somewhere.

I don't have the issue anymore, nor that I use git enough to reproduce it (most of the time I use git commit -m so ... so no vim invoked). \n. What what ?\nI'm speaking about the \"Repair\" options in the ConEmu installer. I've attached a screenshot because a picture definitively beat a long text that is not read or misunderstood.\nCheck list based on your link: \n- with same switch than task in Windows + R: see the case \"Under git-cmd\". No speed down under pure git-cmd ... \n- I tried on Administrator, without any shell profile (I don't use my admin account apart for installing...) either on Bash either on cmd.\n- I can change the buffer size but I think it is irrelevant : it works after using the \"repair\" in installer and I have the default settings for the admin account and it was slow (see \n  settings for the admin account). \n- It is slow even when switching tabs... and I highly doubt this is a behavior of a third party software (and if that was, then it would be mean it was introduced in ConEmu 160515/160522 because I did not install anything apart ConEmu or git-for-windows 2.8.3).\n. I'll try that tonight (I'm at work and I don't have Ms antivirus but Norton) by first disabling it then with exclusion list.\nThanks @princemaple\n. @Maximus5 I will close the issue because the solution reported by @princemaple worked for me, although I needed to reboot the PC.\nI'm sorry for the inconvenience but still think it's strange that the MS AV made ConEmu slow but not after reinstalling it. \nWith Norton/Symantec, I can't disable it or ignore files from analysis so I can't test. \nAll that I can say is that I'm under the impression it seems globally slower at work than at home but it is usable (this issue made ConEmu far more slower in comparison).\nFor the test I made tonight: \n- [x] 160522 MS \"Real Time Protection\" disabled: no problem\n- [x]  Rollback to 160504 + MS \"Real Time Protection\" enabled (after reboot): slow. I'm guessing that now that MS do something (but what?) with ConEmu, it apply to each version :/\n- [x] 160522 MS \"Real Time Protection\" enabled + ignore list for C:\\Program Files\\Git , C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\clink: unlike disabled the Real Time Protection, this need the PC to be rebooted for the changes to be noticeable. So, it works with a reboot..\nMy guess is that the MS AV was updated (it is on automatic mode) some time before I was switching to 160515. \n. I think that's because you added path to executable rather than whole directory. \nI would not be surprised to hear that when starting internally  the AV list all the executable in that directory to disallow new program  (= potential new virus).\n. @ittayd @Maximus5 I have the same problem with recent version of ConEmu (180206) and Git for Windows (2.16.2.windows.1). \nI digged into the problem, because mintty (from Git for Windows) does not come with tabs and vertical/horizontal split, and since two weeks, I'm forcing myself/forced to use it at work because whenever I do something on my tabs, then want to use less, I've got a crash.\nBased on the link provided by @Maximus5, I wrote a sample script which failed on my installation, this may be a good help to change the value of Long console output (see screenshot below) to an acceptable value:\necho whatever > whatever.txt\nfor i in {1..4600}; do echo $i; done\nless whatever.txt\necho 1\nThe last line will crash, because it seems to be the limit for Cygwin. The echo 1 is optional, it just to be sure that ConEmu will execute the less command.\nI noticed that changing the TERM from cygwin to xterm \"fix\" the issue: less is unusable (it does not help ncurses to work), but it does not crash. It is worst on vim: arrows are no longer recognized, the term is not cleared (there are junk from ls for instance), ... \nAlso, in my understanding of cygwin' code, the error is not related to the buffer height (that would also explain when changing TERM affect the outcome of less crashing); cygwin split cmalloc memory in buckets (40) and the size we want simply outbound that block size (max is 6291456/12582912 if I read this comment here). \nWhatever that size is, or where it come, is another question.\n--\nOverall, my options were set like this:\n\nAnd now (the version is different, but it works with 180206 too):\n\n.

Used ScreenToGif and turned on \"detect mouse clicks\" option:\n\n. @Maximus5 I don't think so, I think it's probably an artifact of the capture program I used.

I can reproduce the issue in a debug build with my settings (but it doesn't reproduce with the default settings!).\nIs there anything you'd like me to look at?. Confirmed! -- Mine was set to \"Show\" and setting it to \"Auto\" instead lets me select with my mouse.\nMakes sense as some of the changes between the previous version and this one related to auto-showing the scrollbar.\n. It's because of this.\nbool CConEmuChild::CheckMouseOverScroll() always returns true if the scrollbar is always visible -- regardless of whether the mouse is actually over it.\nTrying a few things now to see if I can adjust the logic and preserve the fix for the bug that was intended to fix.. As I mentioned in the diff for #1536, there are usages of CConEmuChild::CheckMouseOverScroll() that might expect different results for different reasons, so I'm not positive that doesn't break anything else.\nRegardless, I think it should never return true without checking, and in debug that change fixed this issue and hovering over the scroll area displayed the scrollbar as expected when scrollbar visibility was set to \"Auto\".. It's working great for me on a Win10 machine and a Win7 machine.\nI'll go ahead and close this since the fix is available in the new install.. @Maximus5 Do you not generally accept pull requests? I'm curious why you'd prefer to re-do the same thing in your own commit. From a contributor perspective it's not very encouraging, just wondering if there was some issue with my commit or if you prefer to do things differently.\nEither way I'll be glad when this issue is fixed, thanks for all the hard work!. @Maximus5 I tried to make that one consistent with the deleted // 1 -- show always comment, but I guess it makes more sense to change fewer lines.. Always check if the scrollbar is always displayed. Also, apparently it needs to actually check if the scrollbar is set to auto display.. This function/check seems like it may be used for various reasons, I am not 100% certain this doesn't break something else... :(. Oh I see what you mean, good point. I have it set to side-by-side diff by default, so that's not what it looked like for me (though that's the way it is, I suppose, to git.. ",
    "Elfy": "Same issue. \nIn addition to what I said here https://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues/1590#issuecomment-170306246 I tested it in fresh Win7x64 install with minimal configuration (just two cmd tabs). I can reproduce the problem. It happens not on every run, but often enough. (It happened on every run with update on startup on, but I wanted to reproduce it with as little junk in the logs as possible.)\nHere are config and log files from problematic run. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55700542/bad_conemu_session_logs.zip\nThe interesting part is in ConEmu-input-2896.log \nMessages like \n\n23:04:57.405 Searching for conhost\nMore than one created conhost.exe was found!\nMore than one created conhost.exe was found!\n23:04:57.905 ConHostPID=0\n\nappear about once a second, which coincides with apparent refresh rate of slow tab. It is also very different from log of a normal tab.\n. These logs are made with updates turned off.\nThese lines are not present when all tabs function properly. Normal behaviour is\n\n22:36:50.364 Searching for conhost\n22:36:50.426 ConHostPID=1840\n\nin one tab and \n\n22:36:49.411 Searching for conhost\nMore than one created conhost.exe was found!\n22:36:49.739 ConHostPID=1020\n\nin another. Note that PID is not zero in this case and these messages do not get repeated every second either.\n. Works for me. Delays are gone. Thanks!\nThe logs still show ConHostPID=0 though. It seems it can not detect PID of associated conhost when multiple tabs are opened simultaneously. Could it cause problems elsewhere later or is it a nonissue? I'm afraid to dig too deep in the code myself :)\nBTW, there is a way to find exactly which conhost process is associated with specific console app, though it is a bit of a black magic. Would it be beneficial to implement?\n. There is, check my repository if you are curious. I did it to manipulate kb layout in console apps from AHK script. But it relies on some undocumented Windows API and I think it might break in some cases because of security issues, so it's not worth the trouble if it's not really useful.\n. I mean this https://github.com/Elfy/getconkbl\nThe high-level overview is -- find all conhost processes, get all handles in the system (NtQuerySystemInformation), filter handles to processes, which are owned by conhost processes, duplicate them and do GetProcessId(). See if it matches PID of the app.\n. @Maximus5 I think back then the problem of finding associated conhost process fascinated me so much that I've never got to look for a simpler solution :) I'll keep  GetConsoleKeyboardLayoutName in mind.\n@M0ns1gn0r Yes, works for me even with default delay.\n.

I do have this issue as well when SSHing into an Archlinux machine and running Pacman. This has always been the case ever since I've started using ConEmu and I would really love to finally get this fixed.\n\nRelated ticket on the Msys bugtracker which points at ConEmu as the source of the issue: https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/tickets/13/\n. Thanks, I'll give it a try when I'm back home near a Windows machine.. I'm afraid this does not fix it unless I'm using it wrong. I am using Cmder so I decompressed the 7z into vendor/conemu-maximus5 (where the Cmder's default ConEmu lives) and when go into About I do see that the version is the new one I just decompressed. Unfortunately running a pacman -Syu (on Archlinux) still shows the issue. Also tried with the latest development release and still no luck.\n@kyjelblue would you mind telling me how are you using it - with cmder or standalone? And in which programs did you have the problem in the first place?. @Maximus5 Thanks this fixed my issues. https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/905\n. Well, I can't because I couldn't figure out how that would be done. I've searched the documentation which didn't help either.\nWould you please shed some light on how this is done?. It crossed my mind that this may, indeed, be a lot of work. I am looking at the link you gave me to see if I can get the startup dir going per tab. Thank you.. I don't know what you mean by \"actual build\". It was happening on the latest stable build and doesn't repro on preview build. I never used imaginary or some other non-actual build.. Has there been any progress with this issue? I'm getting same error randomly.. I see bash doesn't have delay when typing command or do other stuff but run vim inside ubuntu wsl/bash.exe/wsl delayed somhow, probably because of colors slow it down and vim's plugins. . @meatuses : What's differece between System32\\wsl.exe and System32/bash.exe? I don't see any differences.. @Maximus5 : Can you elaborate? I'm using bash.exe and looking for better one to use as main terminal.. I see, I have only one Ubuntu installed so wsl will default to it. No difference when run wsl.exe and bash.exe, also see we can change the default via wsl.conf. okie then.\np/s: I use bash.exe. Ok, my mistake \nchanged from color #13 (171117) to #0 (171203)\nis correct.\nAnyway if updating, there seem to be no problems, but only if using brand new version of 171203.. promblem is there\n<value name=\"CTS.ColorIndex\" type=\"hex\" data=\"e0\"/>\nold value that allows changing selected text color through color#13 was\n<value name=\"CTS.ColorIndex\" type=\"hex\" data=\"ed\"/>. Version is 171205, only setting changed is \"Main \\ Tabbar \\ Auto show - on\". \nReproduce - open ConEmu and minimize/restore or maximize/restore. \nTransparent tab bar is shown with contents of previous screen (desktop, whatever program was underneath it etc).  The whole screen is shifted down by the reappearing tab bar.. The newer build does indeed fix the problem.. > @TeamSpen210\nThis is a convenience feature. If you run a process and it quits before 10 seconds are up, ConEmum keeps the tab open until you press a key. That ensures if you run some program that ends quickly, you can still see the messages it produces. You can change this to be always/never/10 seconds only in the settings.\nAre you referring to Settings > Integration > Default Term > Confirm close (Press Enter or Esc to close console): [Automatic/Always/Never] ?. Yes, of course :). Thanks Maximus5. However, the instructions you provide are somewhat involved. Hence, I think that my original request - viz., 'provide easy way to give a more fully Linux-like prompt' (stress added) - stands.. ### Solution\nIn Properties, I've checked Compatibility mode on Windows 8, and the conemu exit gracefully \n\n. I expected this to seem like an odd suggestion. Hopefully I can explain why I bothered to recommend it. It could be a fair bit of work, but there is functionality that people are wanting but that no extant program has. My understanding of how ConEmu runs the shells it supports makes it the closest to implementing what is necessary.\n\n\nSSH - I can run an SSH client inside of ConEmu, but if I use it to connect to a Windows SSH server I can't use it with most Windows programs. Per the bug I linked there are parts of the OS that get in the way. SSH client connections can not create terminal services sessions without lots of additions to OpenSSH.\n\n\nRDP - I do not mean that ConEmu should somehow interact with the full remote desktop. That would not make much sense. It would be my hope to expose a shell started on a remote session via ConEmu.\n\n\nI can think of a few ways to do what I have suggested. Some of them involve using features of RDP, but some are more basic, like starting some kind of server in the new session to pipe back the shell interface.\nIf you don't want to do this that is fine, but I thought to suggest it as this is the only project I have seen that manages to successfully do invasive process hooks for a real usecase, and that may be necessary expertise.\n.

    "rossipedia": "Personally I love this feature. I rarely want my Quake style console to be full window height. And being able to just hit Win+Up to expand it to the width of the screen is very convenient.\n. It is! I have Alt+`` bound to enabling it, andAlt+Shift+`` bound to disabling it.\nYou need to go to keybinds, set up a key for one of the Macros, and then for the macro use:\nConEmuC -GuiMacro SetOption Check 2333 1\nto turn on Quake mode and \nConEmuC -GuiMacro SetOption Check 2333 0\nto turn it off\n.

I mentioned this in the comments for 6128ed4. Specifically, I'd like to see that commit either reverted or turned into a checkbox option.\n. @Maximus5 the previous behavior (full width / not full height) is what I expect from a \"Quake\" style console, as in my experience that is the common layout video game or \"visor\" style terminals or consoles (mainly in video games). I'm not opposed to having a maximized state, what makes the latest Conemu harder to use is that the \"visor\" mode (100% width, half height) has been removed.\n@filipesilva no, it doesn't. I run on a 30\" Dell (2560x1600), and whenever I put either 2560px or 100% in the width, it downsizes to something like 1873px (something like that, I can't remember the exact number).\n. Looks like I'm no longer experiencing that issue with the latest release. Normal + 2566px width does the trick for me. Thanks for all the help @filipesilva and @Maximus5 \n. @Maximus5 I forgot I filed this ~9 months ago, but it's been bugging me constantly.

I agree with that buffer can be \"dirty\" under a cursor position, I was talking about position of the last content in the buffer, not about cursor position, from the very first post. So it's not about a restriction, it's about proper UX (User eXperience) - nobody is interested to scrolling to an empty buffer.\nFor example MinTTY (Cygwin's default terminal emulator) or ConsoleZ works exactly as I described. It's incomparably more user friendly.\n. It fails in MinTTY mainly because it's not running under Windows console (GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo failed, not a console?).\nDirty is simply a line in a buffer, into which something was written (we can say except of white space characters). If something writes into previously empty buffer to the line 9997, than that line becomes the last line (or line with the highest number) of \"buffer content\".\nI don't understand, why it should be so hard to implement - each line of buffer would have a dirty flag. Scrollbar's effective area then would be from the line 0 to the last line with a dirty flag set to true. That's all. You can even forget about dirty flag for each line and have just one variable, which holds the line with the highest number into which something was written.\n.

Screenshots of Appearance and Task Bar below (can do others if needed), and log files from a fresh start, with several virtual desktop switches and resultant focusings.\n\n\nConEmu-gui-11896.txt\nConEmu-input-12260.txt\nConEmuC-size-12260.txt\n.

    "iwuvjhdva": "Agree, to show the console on all desktops is the correct behaviour for Quake-style console. In current version when you trigger Quake-style console Windows moves you to the desktop ConEmu was initially opened on while I believe it should stay on current desktop and popup there!\n. ",
    "dgunderson": "I echo the above sentiments. I use so many virtual desktops daily. I hate how Quake mode will force my screen to switch to the virtual desktop that it was initially opened on. It needs to slide down on any current virtual desktop I am currently viewing for this to be useful for me. Is there any such setting to trigger it to behave this way?. Oh, I just found it in settings: Main > Size & Pos > Restore to active monitor:\n\nThat does what I want. Thanks, and never mind. :)\n. ",

    "squishleheimer": "Possibly related, when typing a command of length greater than 8 characters and then hitting escape to clear the input, clink integration has broken the clearing behavour - the last 8 characters remain. This forces me to CTRL-C to do a hard clear. Cycling through history has the same issue - i.e the first 8 characters persist and overwrite the history of each command - but only the rendering. The actual buffer remains correct. This has been an issue since the last ~15 versions but I guess not that many users use clink with conemu.. (?) Still present as of 160607. Oh, and clink version 0.4.7.\n. ",

I have Window Positioning set to Free and X set to 0 pixels.  I thought I might fix this by setting X to a negative value but that is not supported.\n. And yes, I've seen Issue #284 and the referenced Microsoft bug Desktop coordinate system is broken but I'm on Windows 8.1.  Same bug?\n. ",
    "vexe": "I'd really appreciate any help. I'd love to just use conemu/vim forever because conemu was the ONLY thing that let me work in a decent fullscreen in vim\n. Here's a short video I made demonstrating some of my frustrations. You can see how the color of matching brace is bound to the foreground color of highlighted text. I DO NOT want any coloring on braces but if I choose a dark color I would get dark foreground on highlighted text which is NOT what I want. And if I say, change the background of highlighted text (the red) to something else, it would effect other colors (same issue)\nhttps://youtu.be/FeK2GlmYaT0\n. Oh great... lovely, now I'm running into rendering issues with split windows... just great. https://youtu.be/x3cUzH8RKro\n.

When I run vim.exe (tried all compatibility options) I get \n\n(I get the same message when I run it from conemu) thinking back I can't remember what I did yesterday to get the notion that it's a 16-bit maybe I misread something due to frustration.\n. Actually the rendering issues exist in gvim too, not conemu's fault. sigh, vim...\n. No. You still haven't answered my conemu color issues... And didn't reply to my earlier message about the vim.exe you mentioned in you answer.\n. Sorry but It's been days fighting windows/vim/terminal trying to get a decent setup working. So I've been a tad frustrated.\nBy color issues I mean the stuff I mentioned in my original post starting from \"I gave up on...\" and the other  \"Here's a short video I made demonstrating...\" \nI will try the updated SO link.\n.

    "erichiller": "I was having an issue where vim --help displayed then disappeared, after screwing around with scripts and various things for hours. I just unchecked ComEmuHk, fixed everything. Seems like that should break things, but so far, it has been good across the board, Powershell, cmd both. Windows 10 machine. Try that maybe just to help narrow down some variabes maybe?\n. I'll just leave it disabled system wide for now. I haven't noticed any issues by leaving it disabled.\n. I have no errors thus far! Looks great. Thanks for the work again !\n. Double clicking anything within far.exe, menus, file browser, etc...\n. Well, a single click even while using far in a regular console will open a menu, or perform an action. So I am trying to figure out where the error is, software, config, or me somehow?\n. If I single click whilst pressing alt (or windows key), the click is registered, menus will work. \nIf I am not pressing alt, then the click does not register.\nThis is all for left click\nThis is in far.exe.\n\n. Right you are sir! \nConEmu.exe -basic -cmd ../farmanager/far.exe\nyields:\n\nThe task I have setup though is seemingly similar:\n\n. So If I use the override I devised within cmder using what you gave me, it works:\n\"\"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe\" /single -basic -cmd \"../farmanager/far.exe\" \"%USERPROFILE%\" -new_console:d\"\nSo knowing that (THANK YOU!!!!) I tried using /LoadCfgFile with the same ConEmu.xml that I was using before, and it broke in the same fashion. So obviously it was some sort of configuration thing. I went through and started commenting out things I though it could be; it took a bit but I found the line:\n<value name=\"WndDragKey\" type=\"dword\" data=\"80808001\"/>\nSo now I simply changed it to:\n<!-- EVIL LINE; BREAKS FAR.EXE              <value name=\"WndDragKey\" type=\"dword\" data=\"80808001\"/>\nBtw, I heavily modified cmder. I have it running all new vendors everything at this point. Newest conemu, far, git-for-windows (not msysgit); and then I rewrote the ssh-agent init and profile.ps and several other batch and powershell scripts because they were not serving me. But I had unloaded all of that in testing to ensure I hadn't broken far.exe.\nThank you, hopefully this helps somebody else too.\n. Yes I have that as well, and it is terrific, thank you!\nA quick question that is totally outside of your scope, but do you know of a markdown plugin for far? I could not find one.\n. Syntax highlighter/recognition within far for markdown ala vim. There is farhelpdown , but it defunct and the repo no longer listed.\n. Perfect Thankyou!\n. There are two tasks always, and with the same parameters, the ones entered above for the task\n```\nName    PID Status  User name   CPU Memory (private working set)    Description Command line\nbash.exe    6036    Running Eric Hiller 00  3,676 K bash    \"C:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\bin..\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe\" --login -i -l\nName    PID Status  User name   CPU Memory (private working set)    Description Command line\nsh.exe  7248    Running Eric Hiller 00  1,072 K Git for Windows \"C:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5..\\git-for-windows\\bin\\sh.exe\" --login -i -l\n```\nAs far as I can tell, that is \"just how git works\" is that how your's is?\n. How do you have it configured to achieve the above? Also you still have 4 processes, as do I, just 4 different ones.  I run sh.exe Directly which then launches bash.exe. just as it appears your git-cmd.exe does to bash.exe. Still 4 processes.\n\nThen I attemped to create a configuration like yours and it didn't come out the same at all:\n\nIt launced cmd.exe and not bash, but still 4 processes.\nBut it is the 4 processes that triggers the confirm dialog.\n. Yes, It wouldn't work-\n\n. I did; the two screenshot I posted --> https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/377#issuecomment-149043798\neach shows what processes are running and what what task was configured to yield those processes. Let me know if there is something else I should have screenshot?\n-Eric\n. Whether I run ConEmu -basic -cmd {Git bash} or ConEmu -basic -cmd {Git Bash} (capitalization of B) I get \"Command Group not found\", Since it is not loading my config I can only assume. \nIf I run ConEmu -basic -cmd \"C:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\git-cmd.exe\" It loads and operated the exact same as the screenshot with git-cmd.exe & cmd.exe\nI did have it pointing at git-cmd.exe when I ran the screenshot, and the screenshot does show git-cmd.exe and cmd.exe.\n\n. To me it looks that /bin/sh.exe is just doing the same, acting as a launcher for /usr/bin/sh.exe ; but my /git-cmd.exe is most definitely launching cmd.exe and not /usr/bin/sh.exe\n. Doing that directly breaks a whole bunch of things as the GITDIR/bin/bash.exe sets up a whole bunch of environment stuff so that git works within the shell. I could try to set it up by hand using some stuff like\n\"Git\\usr\\bin\\sh.exe\" --login -i --init-file ~\\.profile\nBut it just becomes a mess I guess it is not really worth it to mess around with; I was just hoping you were able to change conemu to recognize GIT/bash.exe and usr/bin/sh.exe as processes that did not require a confirm to close dialog is all.\n. @bentayloruk Sorry for that delay I am going back a bit but I think that so long as I did bash.exe (rather than sh.exe) and had the -l and -i flags it would work. \\msys2\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe -i -l. See if that will work for you?\n. @bentayloruk No problem, also if it helps you any, I have my whole conemu install and all associated software on my repo\n. @bentayloruk Good deal, glad I could help some at least.\n. I have 3 monitors [LEFT][CENTER][RIGHT].\nTypically I keep ConEmu in the Center with the screen sized to normal.  And it behaves as normal [Ctrl]+[~] => open/close.\nPreviously If I moved my cursor over to the [LEFT] or [RIGHT] monitor and did this, the same would apply, but now it takes the entire screen. If I go into settings it will be set to Full Screen now for window size. However for the first time I open the console, the actual console will still only take the Height = 40% I had it set for, but the transparency will take the entire 100%. IF I open and close again, then the transparency will consume the entire amount. Here is my Size & Pos settings\n\nThe normal never persists, after I click apply it always returns to Full Screen\n\n. Note an easy way to tell which monitor is the LEFT is the recycle bin in the bottom left\nNormal looks like:\n\nRe-open on another monitor:\n\nBring it back to any other monitor\n\n. I think the ability to set the color of the active tab is all that is required. Say color_inactive_tab=#XXXXXX vs. color_active_tab=#XXXXXX if that is possible?\n. Sorry - if that is not possible - I do not mean to make it sound easy. I do not know the work/methods that would be required in this case.\n. @Maximus5 -- one idea, if it is easier to implement -- would it be feasible to lighten/darken the icon in the tab? Or even if the icon could be changed. \"Active\" Icon and \"Inactive\" Icon.\n. Besides being able to set an \"Active\" Icon and \"Inactive\" Icon -- the only other thought I have is -- only if possible -- to be able to set and \"Active\" tab title text colour and \"Inactive\" tab title text colour. \nDamn shame otherwise.\nThanks !\n. I realize now that the problem is particularly worsened by the fact that I have transparency. Is it possible to not apply transparency to the tab bar only?\nSecond alternative, possibly bold the active tab font?\n. Yes I concur @cboos this seems an ideal solution. I have certainly read the article on Vim mouse scrolling, and everything else I could find on the web.\nBut the KeyEvents utility you wrote might prove very helpful...\nOnce running KeyEvents I have this output:\n```\nKeyEvents.exe\nKeyEvents from Maximus5, ver 4.3.

I am more than happy to run any tests - any ideas as to what to test?. Ok, I have the logs made. \nIn them I tried scrolling down (didn't work), so I used the keyboard to go down a few lines in order for scrolling up to be possible and tried mousing up (which also didn't work).\nI hope that helps\n-Eric. Done - logs here\nJust to be clear that this was what I was supposed to do. I placed the new ConEmu.exe (version 170109 which is 1945kB) that you provided in the last post into the ConEmu directory I had already (which was 161206) - overwriting the previous ConEmu.exe (which was 1923kB).\nThe logs attached are from the new ConEmu.exe (version 170109 which is 1945kB) .. Yep, that did it! Working scrolling - not sure whether you wanted the logs, but I thought you might. So here they are. Of course, once I tried it without -basic and it reverted to 64-bit operation and thus the accordant older 161206 64-bit binary on my system - scrolling stopped working.\nAs always, much thanks! I'll look for the 64-bit binary then. I always appreciate you looking at things. \n-Eric. Yep, confirmed.\nRemoving.\ninoremap <Esc>[62~ <C-X><C-E>\n    inoremap <Esc>[63~ <C-X><C-Y>\n    nnoremap <Esc>[62~ <C-E>\n    nnoremap <Esc>[63~ <C-Y>\nand it works the same whether it is present or not.\nThanks much!\n. Did anything revert since this the 0805 release?

Currently ConEmu loads only first icon from binaries that contains multiple icons. I'll try fix this, also may be try to implement loading icons from shell associations (found TODO comment for that in you source)\n. Well, for example.\nConEmu autodetects \"Dev 14 command prompt\" as task. Best icon for this task is icon 33 from %CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\\microsoft shared\\MSEnv\\VSFileHandler.dll but ConEmu can load only icon 0 from exe and dll files\n. I've found it. Is use ExtractIconEx(pszLoadFile, 0, &hIconLarge, &hIconSmall, 1)\nI'll fix it, but it is my first fork on github, so I still learning doing that right\n. Request created\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/pull/378\n. Ok, I'll try to reset caches etc.\n. 1. List works only for x64 GUI at x64 OS (is it as planned?)\n2.

Completely reinstalled ConEmu to latest build\n1. [FIXED] If Windows is 64, then list worked only for ConEmu64.exe, not for ConEmu.exe (was wrong before, OK now))\n2. At Windows x64 only 32 bit ConEmu.exe automatically adds SDK::VS (by GUI I've mean conemu gui) - so it's strange\n3. Jumplist icons are displayed wrong (as I show at screenshot upper) - task has custom icon specified in settings (both ways - by /icon or by new_console:C:), but jumplist icon is default icon of task target, not custom. I've think that it is wrong because of Windows icon caches (and so on I try to clear theem), but now i see, that it is wrong specified by ConEmu \"Update Now!\" button\nAbout screenshot - yes, it is outdated now, but problems are same, so I do not update it \nAfter reinstalling default tasks are\n{Shells::TCC}\n{Shells::cmd}\n{Shells::cmd (Admin)}\n{Shells::cmd-32}\n{Shells::cmd 64/32}\n{Shells::PowerShell}\n{Shells::PowerShell (Admin)}\n{Bash::CygWin bash}\n{Bash::Git bash}\n{Bash::MinGW bash}\n{Bash::Msys2-64}\n{Helper::Show ANSI colors}\n{Tools::Chocolatey (Admin)}\n{SDK::VS 11.0 x86 tools prompt}\n{SDK::VS 14.0 x86 tools prompt}\nLast two are auto added only in 32 bit ConEmu\n.

    "d0vgan": "Because it happens exclusively under ConEmu!\nIn pure FAR, without ConEmu, everything is clear in FAR: no blinking of the functional key bar, and the reaction to Shift is as expected (the key titles are changed).\nFAR2 and FAR3 in their real console windows do not have these problems at all.\nWhereas both FAR2 and FAR3 have it under ConEmu.\n. Oh, just tried \"far /p\" and there is no issue under ConEmu.\nSo it looks like ConEmu confronts with some of FAR's plugin(s).\nWill investigate which one it is.\n. Funny to say it, but the guilty one is the ConEmu plugin!!!\nWith the ConEmu folder alone under the FAR's plugins folder, the issue exists.\nWith all the other plugins except the ConEmu folder under the FAR's plugins folder, the issue does not exist.\nIf I keep only FAR\\plugins\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.dll under the FAR\\plugins folder, the issue exists.\n- tested with FAR 2.1 build 1807 bis29 x86 under ConEmu 150913 [32] with both default and custom settings of ConEmu.\n. After further investigations it looks like I was wrong about FAR3 - I can't reproduce the issue with FAR3.\nHowever, with FAR 2.1 it's constant. I've verified it under Windows 7 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 8.1 64-bit on different PCs.\n. Sorry, could you comment: can it be fixed or not? Or you could not reproduce it?\n. Well, removing the file \"FAR2\\plugins\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.dll\" seems to be the only fix for this problem. Which is not great, though, because it leads to loosing the ability of drag'n'drop from/to FAR2 panels :(\n. Great, it works! (Looked at the source code changes - it was a surprise that a plugin calls a macro! Seems to be deeply integrated with FAR.)\nDo I understand correctly that another minor blinking issue can't be fixed so easy? I'm referring to the one described in the very first post: \n\"When Shift is pressed in FAR's panels, the functional key bar (at the bottom of FAR's window) blinks each second or so. Can this blinking be disabled?\"\nThank you!\n. OK, the main issue is solved so I think it's resolved.\n. Nope :) I meant 160522, 160515 - I've updated that in the first message.\n. I don't understand anything. \nAt first, with ConEmu.xml created from scratch, everything seemed to work. \nAnd it seemed to work even after I've changed some of settings. \nBut some time after that - and it seemed to happen after I just resized FAR's window (inside ConEmu) with mouse and moved the window with mouse, I don't remember I've changed something else! - for some reason:\n1. I've got doubled ConEmu entries in FAR's Plugins menu, and also \n2. in ConEmu -> Edit console output I can see only output from \"cmd /?\" but not from \"sfk\".\nAs for the 2nd issue, I can scroll sfk's output via mouse in ConEmu's window, but in FAR in ConEmu -> Edit console output I don't see anything from sfk...\n. There's only one ConEmu.dll loaded by Far.exe process (plus one instance per ConEmuBg.dll, ConEmuCD.dll, ConEmuHk.dll, ConEmuLn.dll and ConEmuTh.dll). \nBut here is the command line of Far.exe (that was automatically started within ConEmu):\n\"far.exe\" /w /p\"C:\\Progs\\FAR2\\Plugins\\ConEmu;%FARHOME%\\Plugins\"\nIt seemed to be added automatically by ConEmu.\nIf I explicitly run cmd.exe as a new console in ConEmu, then cd to FAR2's folder and type \"far\", I have a Far.exe process with command line specified as \"far\" - and it does not have doubled ConEmu entries in FAR's Plugins menu!\n. Yes, always.\nThough after you asked it I can see that ConEmu in some magic way can start Far from a folder on the same level where the ConEmu folder is - i.e. when ConEmu.exe and Far.exe are located in different folders rather than in the same folder. (It's not clear to me how it finds FAR's folder in that case.)\n. OK, I don't have the doubled ConEmu entries in FAR's Plugins menu after I manually removed \"%ConEmuDir%\\Plugins\\ConEmu;\" from Startup -> Tasks -> {Far}.\nBut still I get an empty editor when calling ConEmu -> Edit console output. This time, though, I've seemed to understand when it happens! It happens when I start any external program via a .bat file. In this case, nothing is present in FAR's editor. Whereas when I start the very same program not from a .bat file but directly running its .exe file, the output is present in FAR's editor.\n. Here is an example:\n1. create a file \"c.bat\" with the following in it:\ncmd /?\n2. run this \"c.bat\" within ConEmu (I run it from FAR2 within ConEmu)\n3. call ConEmu -> Edit console output - FAR's editor is empty!\n4. run \"cmd /?\" directly in FAR's console\n5. call ConEmu -> Edit console output - everything is in the editor!\n. Is it a known issue? It looks like a big miss. (Personally I have a lot of programs in different folders and the corresponding .bat files with relative paths to these programs - these .bat files are inside FAR's folder. So I can start almost any program from FAR and in general I don't care if they are started as an executable directly from FAR's folder or as a .bat file pointing to an executable in a different folder. But ConEmu's Edit console output seems to create a difference between .exe and .bat...)\n. You run it with FAR 3. The issue is not reproduced with FAR 3 for me as well.\nWith FAR 2.1 build 1807 bis29 x86 it is reproduced.. ",

During that time I experienced some slowdowns when spawning new processes though, I'll open another ticket if I can repro that.\n. Yes, that works! Thanks!\n. Hmm, I think if you go see vsvarsall.bat the script is actually very simple. Taking 1 second vs 17 seconds is quite big an overhead, definitely not a 10ms overhead.\nShould I recompile conemuhk.dll and try to do a profile?\n. Awesome! That fixed it.\n. ",

I wanted this way because when you don't use ConEmu, you can call that batch file and apply doskeys.\nFor example, using Command Processor/AutoRun registry key to automatically apply these doskeys.. @Maximus5 Is it possible to ship 7-zip executable or integrate its library (7za) with ConEmu?.

Just delete that line or comment it by writing \"rem \" at the beginning, because everything it's doing is displaying the username and hostname.\nII. Maybe you should try creating a shortcut to it or to parent directory of it in some convenient place (like mentioned user folder)?\nFor overwriting problem, you could create backup of edited CmdInit.cmd file, and replace content of original file with that from backup after every update. On the other hand, it could require even more effort than removing this single line every time manually.\nFor the future - you should look at the comments above every line, because the whole CmdInit.cmd file is documented very well. For example, the one from your first question was described by \"rem This will start prompt with User@PC\". Very unambiguous, don't you think? ;)\n. ",

Clicking the \"Update Now!\" is what caused the problem in the first place, and I have tried re-clicking it numerous times before without any success.\nHowever when I tried it again today it magically fixed itself.  I have no idea why it didn't work before.\nAnyway, you can mark this as closed now.\n. I've just managed to re-create the problem.\n1. Start ConEmu.\n2. Go to Settings->Startup->Tasks\n3. Select any task from the list and edit it in some way (e.g. change the name of the task)\n4. Click \"Save Settings\"\n5. Go to Settings->Main->Task Bar\n6. Click \"Update Now!\"\nThe jump lists will now be broken.  To fix them you have to restart ConEmu and click \"Update Now!\" without ever clicking on \"Save Settings\".\n. No this is a bug.  If I change the name of a task, then surely I have to run Update Now to update the jump lists to use the new task name?\nAlso changing just one task name breaks all jump list tasks, not just the one that was changed.\nThe error message is also nothing to do with a missing command.\nTry my steps out and you will see what I mean.\n. The error is the one that I already mentioned...\n\nUnknown switch specified:\n/single/cmd {Shells:cmd}\n\nPlease try the steps I gave to re-create the issue.\n. Did you click Update Now after saving the settings?\n. I don't start ConEmu with the /single switch.\nI suggest you actually follow my steps in case there are two bugs here.  It is the pressing of the \"Update Now\" button after clicking the \"Save Settings\" button that causes the problem for me.\n. I can confirm the new version fixes the problem.  Thanks.\n. Sorry should have done a better search before submitting this.  Seems this is a clink bug which has been fixed but not released yet.  Please close this issue.\nhttps://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/384\n. ",

Looks like \"GRAVE\" leak happens both ways - entering or leaving ConEmu.\n\nVideo can be viewed from link below.\nhttp://screencast.com/t/04E2LA96y9k\nThanks for your patience.\n. I guess issue is not related to keys ConEmu might be posting to mintty, but keys ConEmu is not preventing to send, since they're hit by a Global Shortcut.\nCtrl + GRAVE - GRAVE specially - global shortcut shouldn't be sent either to mintty or notepad, since it should be caught by ConEmu.\nNotice notepad also gets GRAVE when ConEmu is switched off by Ctrl+GRAVE.\nDoes it make any sense?\n. Same thing happens if I switch to a completely non-cygwin console like cmd or PowerShell.\nAnd it still seems odd, since not only EVERY ChildGui gets the annoying keypress, but any other application that gets focused after ConEmu is switched off, by Global shorcut.\nCan I consider this is a non-reproducible issue in your environment?\n. Issue was completely solved by deleting ConEmu.xml and creating a new one from scratch.\nThat makes me believe issue is related to ConEmu, and not to mintty or cygwin.\nFor some reason GH is not allowing me to update old cfg file, so let me know if you're interested so I can privately send it out.\n.

The link provided by @Maximus5 fixes the tab closing confirmation, but then my bash config load and whatever else the bin/sh.exe wrapper is doing, is missing.\n. @Maximus5 apologies, but I did not intend to ask for your help or suggest this issue be re-opened.  I'm just asking @variab1e what he ended up doing.  Have I done something wrong?\n. @Maximus5 I can clarify why I was asking.  My reading of this issue suggested to me that /bin/sh.exe is doing things and then running /usr/bin/sh.exe.  It may be my lack of expertise, but I don't know what things are being done by /bin/sh.exe.  It was definitely doing some things, like loading the bashrc, but I don't know what else it was doing.  Therefore, I am currently unsure as how to replicate the behaviour when directly calling /usr/bin/sh.exe.  Although bin/sh.exe and usr/bin/sh.exe share a name, they are not the same binary.\nI will go away and read up on sh.exe and figure it out.  However, I thought @variab1e might have an update.  As I ended up here, it's not unreasonable to think other people might too.\nAgain, I really appreciate your work and did not intend to suggest that this was your problem.\n. Thanks @variab1e, I'll give it a go.\n. @variab1e awesome, thanks.  Your suggestion worked, but I didn't realise immediately.  I ended up having some follow up issues due to x64 installs and a networking issue on the VM.  All very confusing, but got there in the end!\n. @variab1e you did.

For some reason the batch file no longer works, despite not changing it.\n\nHere is the contents of the batch file:\n```\n@echo off\nset t1=%time%\njulia -e \"println(123)\"\nset t2=%time%\nset /A dt=(1%t2:~6,2%-1%t1:~6,2%)+(60(1%t2:~3,2%-1%t1:~3,2%))+(3600(1%t2:~0,2%-1%t1:~0,2%)) > nul\necho Started  at:  %t1%\necho Finished at:  %t2%\necho Duration sec: %dt%\ngoto :EOF\n```\nTried copying it from this thread again. Made no difference.\nSo I improvised, and counted the seconds using the clock in ConEmu, just running the julia -e command from the batch file; no change.\nHere is the new logs, with durations.\nhttps://gist.github.com/H-225/38bc501054707616c714\nTried changing the configuration of MacType as suggested. The only change was that MacType stopped smoothing the fonts in ConEmu. The timings, as previously measured, were not affected.\nI am using the release version of Julia 0.4.0; the installer binary, as per the http://julialang.org website, which I believe has the SHA-1 hash: f60fe3672bfd96aedc73274971a4b16e66ca4541\nThe debug versions of the hooking DLLs resulted in an increased startup time for ConEmu, \nthe time to reach the shell prompt, to five seconds from when the window first appears.\nIt made no difference to the original problem; still takes 15-20 seconds or so.\nI also received the \"trap\" dialog box (as shown) almost every time (more often than not) I pressed Tab for tab-completion, although the completion did appear.\nThe trap logs that were generated on the desktop all contained the same thing, which was the same as what appeared in the dialog box.\n\n. I'll do that for a while and get back to you.\nAside from Julia crashing with the \"stopped working\" message on one occasion, none as yet.\n. Will you be wanting the mini dump or the full dump?\nThe full dump is some 400MB.\nThe mini dump is 30MB.\nAlso, any suggestions as to how to get it to you?\n. I'm not clear on what exactly you want.\n- ProcessExplorer's *.dmp dump file\n- \"Active process memory dump\" in ConEmu, opens ConEmuC which never closes, and does not appear to yield a file\nIf the 30MB mini-dump file from ProcessExplorer will suffice, do you have a way for me to give it to you?\n. Turns out I can 7-Zip both dump files down to 44MB. Does this work?\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/wgimly6wfe7145c/julia-dumps.7z?dl=0\n. I am unable to debug the Julia process as it initializes. \nTo do that I would have to:\n- Enter the julia command\n- Press Win+Alt+D\n- Append /AUTOMINI 500\n- Click the Start button.\nI cannot complete all those steps between typing the command and Julia finishing initialization.\nHow would I have ConEmu debug a process which is to be launched when I click Start ?\nOr is there something I'm missing?\n. It is however worth noting that on the build you mention (151119, x64), Julia takes six seconds to initialize.\n. @Maximus5 What actually was the problem in the end?\n. @mmoh Hmmm... That does indeed cause it to load much more quickly. That seems like that should be the default behaviour.\n. ",

There I saw the possibility to put 8 hexadecimal characters, ...\nI have no put the maximum value of 32766 and this is working fine.\nIn order to avoid questions like those, maybe it's an idea to put the minimum/maximum value in the hint of every number field of the \"Settings\" tab.\n.

Would you accept a PR to increase the max size beyond 32766?. I like a challenge.. See #1604.. Related to #393. The patch is working. I quickly realized it was impossible to create buffers larger than 32k. Instead, I improved the UI, and default to maximum size instead of 9999.. This change is necessary. When the user enters 222222 or 111111, ConEmu now switches to 32766.\nIf we revert this, users will get confused when they try to enter 222222.  The user\u2019s goal is to max out the value. Without this change, 222,222 will max out at 22,222, not 32,766 as expected.\nSame for 111111. . Hi, see my reply at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/pull/1604#issuecomment-397253345\nThis can't be rolled back without breaking the UI when the user enters 222222 or 111111.

The only way to make it stop is to Kill active process. I've assigned it to a keyboard shortcut and that's it. Probably this issue needs to be closed, for sure there's nothing to be done on ConEmu side.\n.

I prefer not to change the shipped msys2_shell.cmd so here are my two ConEmu tasks for MSYS2:\nBash::Msys2-64\n(This is one of the preinstalled tasks, unmodified)\n\nset CHERE_INVOKING=1 & set \"PATH=%ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\usr\\bin;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe -new_console:p %ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe --login -i -new_console:C:\"%ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\msys2.ico\"\n\nBash::mingw64\n\nset CHERE_INVOKING=1 & set MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit & set \"PATH=%ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin;%ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\usr\\bin;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe -new_console:p %ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe --login -i -new_console:C:\"%ConEmuDrive%\\msys64\\msys2.ico\"\n\nWith this setup, I keep the default limited PATH for the msys shell while I use the full path for the mingw64 shell. Here is some great info on the two shells and how PATH is treated.. Yes. It's a Dell XPS 13 machine if that matters (it doesn't even have a single scroll area anymore, I need to scroll with two fingers). Thanks.. It's a bit hard to communicate this but in the Gif below, I tried to scroll really slowly in both cmd.exe and ConEmu. The difference is quite big. \n\nDoes this help? Should I still produce the logs or is that not necessary?. Hi, logs are attached. Hopefully I produced them right, if not, please let me know and I will re-do them.\nconemu-1560-logs.zip\n. It used to be three lines at a time (by default) and I didn't change anything on my laptop but to answer your question about what would be my expected behavior, it would be browser-like smooth scrolling: slow when I'm using the two-finger gesture slowly, fast when quickly.\nBTW, last week I used Mac for the first time and tried  iTerm2 there. I was blown away when I was able to smooth-scroll through man pages in the less pager, with very browser-like experience. It must be experienced, it's hard to described the nuances of it but it worked really well.. Cool, I would assume this is relatively hard to implement (it took browsers years to do smooth scrolling properly on Windows) but if it works, that would be amazing.. Great, looking forward to trying it out later today!. Oh yeah, this is so much better! The current build goes in the right direction but the scrolling is noticeably slower than in other apps (I tried Chrome, Windows Explorer and Typora). In those app, I can flick the fingers quickly and it will scroll many pages at once. I don't get quite the same behavior in ConEmu but at least it is sensitive and I feel it reacting to the speed of my touch-scrolling which is lovely.. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  I tried to google it a couple of times, only ended up here: https://conemu.github.io/en/StartupDir.html\nThanks, the link you posted contains the info I need.. I finally got to try the tips from https://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html but neither worked entirely.\nFor the zsh shell, I've submitted this PR: https://github.com/ConEmu/ConEmu.github.io/pull/27\nFor the ANSI code, I put this into my .zshrc:\nif [[ -n \"${ConEmuPID}\" ]]; then\n  PS1=\"$PS1\\[\\e]9;9;\\\"\\w\\\"\\007\\e]9;12\\007\\]\"\nfi\nbut got this as a result:\n.../Dev/temp\n$ \\[\\e]9;9;\"\\w\"\\007\\e]9;12\\007\\]\nAll up to the dollar sign is part of my customized prompt, then I get all the characters literally which I'm not sure why it happens.\nBut the method in the submitted PR works.. So for MSYS2 shells, are there substantial advantages of using\n\nset MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe -new_console:p C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\zsh.exe --login -i\n\nover just\n\nset MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\zsh.exe --login -i\n\n? I see visual differences like colors (the first reports TERM as being xterm-256color, the latter as cygwin and doesn't render my 243 prompt color as gray but rather white), and also the tab title is different (the former is e.g. ~, the latter is Borek@PC: ~). Other than that, starting zsh.exe directly seems to work fine so far.. I'm still trying to understand what the connector does to my environment. For example, while the following example doesn't make much sense in its own right, I'm not sure why the output is false when this is run from the standard Windows console tab:\n$ %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe node -p -e \"Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)\"\nfalse\nI guess that's what forcing me to use winpty when my ConEmu task starts with the connector. (The very ugly %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe winpty node -p -e \"Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)\" returns true.)\n. Understood. Thanks.. ",

Or is there a way I can prevent this?\n. Thanks, this works better except that arrow keys and end/home etc do not work at all within the connector, not sure if that's normal still or not expected.\nAnother issue I have although not very problematic so far is that after I exit the connector the terminal is kinda broken and does not print my keystrokes anymore:\n```\nseld:~\n$ ^C\nseld:~\n$ logout\n{PID:52356} pid=48316 was terminated\n{PID:52356} Stopping our threads\n{PID:52356} reverting ConInMode to 0x00000019\n{PID:52356} normal exit from main\nseld:~\n$ bash: lll: command not found\nseld:~\n$\n```\nYou see I typed lll<enter> and it didn't show it, just shows the error.\n.

Thanks and sorry for the noise, I'll report back in a new issue if I find anything else breaking.\n. Actually one issue I have left is that some programs don't render well anymore, I have problems with nano and irssi for example. Not sure if it's related to colors or not, but the text rendering is messed up when re-rendering full screens it seems. Like when I do page-down in a long nano file, or in irssi it is doing weird stuff all the time too when switching channel..\nFor example in this screen shot, I opened the ConEmu.xml in nano, then press PgDown once, you see it rendered the following lines on the right, but the whitespace on the left did not overwrite what was on the left in the first lines, so it looks totally weird:\n\n. Last version fixed the rendering issues in nano and such, thanks!\nI still have some strange whitespace issue in irssi though. Not sure what causes it if it's a mis-representation of the terminal height or something like that.\n. It goes like this when I first ssh in and screen -r I rejoin my irssi session and it's messed up (two empty lines appear between the status bar lines):\n\nThen if I switch to the second window it resyncs the whole screen and then it paints correctly but there are two empty lines between the status bar and the channel content.\n\nThen if I scroll the chatlog up and down again, it renders as it should:\n\nI am not sure how to best reproduce this unfortunately.. Might depend on the irssi config.\n. Sorry kinda gave up on this for a bit.. Here are the logs at the three steps above (see screenshots in previous comment) https://gist.github.com/Seldaek/3665f565315de7b7c5fe - It might be my irssi theme doing weird stuff I don't know but it used to work fine before so it sounds like it still should work with the connector and msys2 etc.\n. Sadly yes I still have weird issues ConEmu.. I use it as it's working quite well overall but I have two types of tabs I create: One way it works well when I am ssh'd into a machine except when pasting into a nano window it all pastes in one line. In that mode also git add -p which uses perl blocks the terminal entirely when I run it, so it's not usable for local work. The other way works well locally but through SSH I then get garbage in some circumstances.\nAnyway I don't know what to do but I should get a new laptop soon so I guess I will try a clean slate setup of everything there and hopefully it works. Or maybe use WSL/bash for windows instead of msys. What would you recommend using at this point?. Sorry I gave up on msys/mingw entirely and now use WSL which works much better. Probably can close this as I don't have a way to provide more info at this point.. ",

any chinese become half-width (width=single-english-letter)\nit won't reset to double-width even if i toggle \"monospace\" setting\nbut it will reset if i open up another tab2 of bash.exe without conemu-cyg-64.exe AND toggle \"monospace\" setting, now tab1 is showing chinese as double-width correctly\nit took me multiple times to confirm it relative to conemu-cyg-64.exe as it seemed ramdom at first to me\n. in *nix world when double width characters is handled correctly, the terminal app (and vim) calculate character width correctly, regardless of what encoding/locale is used for bash/vim/ls/echo/cat\nsome cjk symbol like quotes/comma may be display'ed as single in some case (with specified font?), maybe with rxvt/mrxvt. so there's an option in vim, set ambiwidth=double, or set ambiwidth=single. it affect those \nat least let's say mintty. set mintty to UTF-8 mode, let vim/ls output GBK characters, every English is single-width while every Chinese is Double width\nset mintty to GBK mode and let vim/ls output UTF-8 characters. ditto\n80 english letter or 40 chinese character can be fit in single line, both vim and mintty thinks so. while \"ls/cat/echo\" just don't care. readline/screen/tmux etc however care because it has to move between character/calculate the width of it so handle it correctly after cursor move across the end of line going to the begin of next line\nand sorry i don't have any idea of the behavior of conhost UTF-8 mode\n. looks good\n.

    "josh-egan-ps": "So I discovered that the root cause is that if any command window is running, such as cmd, bash, or anything else, that the drives aren't updated until they are all closed. This includes background processes. By searching through the running processes and killing all shell instances, then the path is correctly loaded the next time a shell is started, whether through ConEmu or stand alone.\nSo this is not an issue with ConEmu, but I thought I'd share my findings in case anyone else stumbles across this.\n.

I have a lot of issues when I use Cygwin(64), Msys2(64), WSL Bash, with ConEmu. Mostly when I ssh into my linux machines. Lots of issues with text editors. Window resizing causing the screen and text to go crazy. Keyboard issues. I've read docs over and over and honestly I think the issue is poor documentation. Because I have no idea if what I'm trying to achieve is possible or impossible due to technical limitations. The documentation is vague, ambiguous, scattered, and assumes the user knows more than they generally do.\nOn the flip side, I can use Mintty with Cygwin or Msys2 and ssh into my linux machines and I have none of the issues described above. I have tried the Cygwin/Msys connectors with no luck.\nA big issue for me is the incredible fast amount of settings and switches that exist with ConEmu, and I have a very incomprehensive understanding of what they do; due to lack of good documentation, imo.. How do you get it to execute a command in the task? Right now my task is %WslBaseDir%\\wsl-con.cmd -run \"-new_console:C:%LOCALAPPDATA%\\lxss\\bash.ico\" \"-new_console:np\" & \"ssh user@server\" , but the last & \"ssh user@server\" part does not execute. I quickly came up with solution. it's not pretty or well thought out at all. but im glad i learned a fundamental i didnt know b4\nwsl-con.cmd original\nline 88 conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t ./wsl-boot.sh\nwsl-con.cmd modified\nline 88 conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t ./wsl-boot.sh %~2\nwsl-boot.sh  original\nline 5 bash -l -i\nwsl-boot.sh  modified\nbash\nbash -l -i -c \"ssh $1\"\nconemu task original \n%WslBaseDir%\\wsl-con.cmd -run  \"-new_console:C:c:\\path\\to\\icon\\icon.ico\" \"-new_console:np:t:tabName\"'\nconemu task modified\n%WslBaseDir%\\wsl-con.cmd -run  \"-new_console:C:c:\\path\\to\\icon\\icon.ico\"  \"user@server\" \"-new_console:np:t:tabName\"\n-run = first argument\n\"user@server\" = second argument. I cant get my enter key to work in conemu with emacs. it works in vi. I've used WSL bridge, msys2 and cygwin connectors, spent hours and hours trying to fix it :(\nI fix one problem and another one shows up\nwell \"zile\", not emacs technically\neverything works fine if I use mintty.exe directly. try updating task bar . Had to fiddle with it for a while to figure out what was going on. I got it to work but I may have a different version but worth a shot\nSettings > Integration >> ComSpec > At the bottom, register the reg setting with Force new ConEmu window unchecked > Dont forget to hit Register Button then Save Settings Button.\nThen I closed all ConEmu windows/processes\nThen opened a fresh conemu session and back into: Settings > Integration > ConEmu Here > Command: change it to /single -run {cmd} -cur_console:n. and make sure to hit the Register Button before hitting Save settings Button. \nThen I closed all ConEmu windows processes again and went back into the settings to see if it kept my settings. Because it kept adding /nosingle even though I took it away, I think because I had the \"Force\" check box checked on step 1. \nAlso dunno if this will help, it mentioned you could use -reuse -run if you hover over the command text box for conemu here in a bubble tooltip, but I didnt need to do that in the end\n. if it helps, my {cmd}  = default shell, taskbar jump lists, /icon \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /single, cmd.exe /k \"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\CmdInit.cmd\". @Maximus5 I was wondering, does this https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/09/22/24-bit-color-in-the-windows-console/ mean good things for the 24bit color support? Will it solve all the problems surrounding the color support you think?. damn. Is there any way to get 256colors with scroll buffer, without having to use WSL? I've been trying but seems only WSL will do it. prefer not to use wsl so I can use ssh-pagent and other stuff. With the connectors, can you leave buffering on , and still get the 24bit colors? I was having trouble with that part. But if its possible i'll mess with it some more. I get this issue really bad. I basically cant use conemu. resizing the window completely breaks the colors. im using the provided connectors and wsl-con.bat and all that.\nif i just use wsltty, it's perfect. I can resize no breaking issues. conemu has a ton of issues with resizing. i dont understand why. Is real console the same thing as terminal emulator? Why not call it native terminal emulator , or something like that.. ",

To keep the internal changes to PATH variable intact you'll have to differentiate changes to the PATH variable introduced by the internal export feature from those introduced by the external changes to system and/or user PATH variables.\nThe idea I have in mind is a bit convoluted, but I'll try to explain it. When ConEmu starts you should save the original PATH variable that was inherited from the parent process to CONEMU_PATH. \nThen with every change to the PATH variable by the internal export feature you'll have to see what was added/removed to the original PATH and save those deltas. You should also apply those new changes (deltas) to CONEMU_PATH and then SetEnvironmentVariable on it to introduce those changes to the process.\nNext whenever WM_SETTINGCHANGE message arrives that CONEMU_PATH should be completely overwritten by changes made to user or/and system PATH variables. Then accumulated internal changes should be applied to it and again SetEnvironmentVariable should be used used to apply those changes to the process. \nHere is the pseudo-code for what was described above:\n``` csharp\n// Somewhere when the ConEmu process starts\nGetEnvironmentVariable(\"PATH\", &CONEMU_PATH, CONEMU_PATH.Length)\nPathChangeDeltas internalPathChangeDeltas = new PathChangeDeltas();\n...\nswitch (Msg.message)\n{\n...\n    case WM_SETTINGCHANGE:\n        CONEMU_PATH = MACHINE_PATH + \";\" + USER_PATH;\n        CONEMU_PATH = ApplyDeltas(CONEMU_PATH, internalPathChangeDeltas);\n        SetEnvironmentVariable(\"PATH\", CONEMU_PATH);\n        break;\n    case WM_INTERNAL_PATH_EXPORT:\n        String EXPORTED_PATH = Msg.wParam;\n        newDeltas = getPathChangeDeltas(CONEMU_PATH, EXPORTED_PATH);\n        CONEMU_PATH = ApplyDeltas(CONEMU_PATH, newDeltas);\n        internalPathChangeDeltas.Append(newDeltas);\n        SetEnvironmentVariable(\"PATH\", CONEMU_PATH);\n        break;\n...\n}\n```\nMACHINE_PATH and USER_PATH will have to be pulled from the respective branches of Windows registry.\nThe Append() method, should you choose to actually implement something similar to what I described, can destroy mutually cancelling deltas, e.g. if one delta adds \"C:\\Windows\" to the path and another one removes it then both those deltas can be safely removed.\n. @Maximus5, how does my suggestion of updating only the PATH variable contradict that note?\nAlso, I don't think that you will be able to easily change, if at all, Environment Variables of already started (in ConEmu) terminal processes (not sure what WAP and GitExtensions terminals are, I'm talking about things like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, or sh.exe started inside ConEmu). It is not the right thing to do anyway. \nBut timely update of the PATH variable of the ConEmu process so that all newly started terminals inherit the updated PATH shouldn't be a problem. At least that is the default behaviour I would expect of ConEmu.\n. @strrchr you are correct about registry entries.\nIf you ignore the exported changes from console up to ConEmu process then, well, you will just break that exporting functionality. My suggestion, if implemented, would combine both features.\nThough I already see that the algorithm I described above is not exactly correct. To calculate correct deltas you'll have to check for differences between PATH that was just exported up from terminal process and the original PATH the terminal process was started with. That is in ConEmu you'll have to store a per terminal process PATH snapshot (taken when that terminal process was started) for the purpose of calculating deltas.\nOn the side note, @Maximus5, consider the following case. You have two different terminals running in ConEmu. Let's say that ConEmu's PATH is \"A;B;C\". When two terminals were created they inherited that PATH. Now the first terminal makes changes to the PATH variable \"A;B;C\" -> \"K;L;M\". And it exports that path up to the ConEmu. Now ConEmu's PATH is \"K;L;M\". Then the second terminal changes its PATH \"A;B;C\" -> \"X;Y;Z\" and exports it up to ConEmu. Boom, you've just overwritten the \"proper\" PATH that was exported up by the first terminal with \"proper\" PATH that was exported up by the second terminal. \nIn the above case you allow one terminal to overwrite changes that were made by the other terminal, but at the same time you don't like the idea of overwriting ConEmu's environment by the system-wide environment changes, which, I argue, should at least take precedence to bottom-up environment updates.\n.

And on WM_SETTINGCHANGE, load new system environemnt variables and apply the delta.\n. Sorry, I updated the comment.\n. I just found cpu time of ConEmuC64.exe in process manager is a bit too high like a 2D game.\nSo I think it would be nice if there is some way to reduce the frame rate.\nAnd it would be nice if the rendering is totally disabled when the ConEmu window is minimized.\n.

Confusing, and bad.\nIf you set up ConEmu to open new windows instead of new tabs, you don't have that problem. Another inconsistency!\nI don't really care about processing WM_SETTINGCHANGE or not. The environment of the ConEmu window doesn't preoccupy me*. It's the console I launched that really needs to inherit the explorer's environment\n* Although I'm all in favor of https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/987 -- but at least the current behaviour has a certain logic to it.\n. The ability to run a script when opening a new tab would indeed be of tremendous help. I don't remember very well (it's been more than 18 months) but I tried to investigate that and I don't think it is possible in ConEmu. The ability to run a script whenever a console is opened (no matter the method) would also help. I someone wants to investigate.... Indeed, I thought I had tested that already, but apparently not. I set my init script up to call a script that resets the PATH variable (one could use the ResetEnv.cmd script @Koriit linked above) and it works fine :+1: . ",

Hi @Maximus5 I've been having the same issue.\nIt's true, as @glhez reported, that after re-installing ConEmu the problem goes away.\nAnd, restarting the system would make the problem reappear.\nWith some minor digging, I've noticed that the slowness/sluggishness only appears when ConEmu is working with a bash shell or calling to bash related executable that come with git installation.\nHas there been any change to inter process communication / new process creation?\nI also tried re-installing git, made no difference.\nEDIT: I don't see any slowdown when switching between tabs. Only that when creating new bash tabs the prompt is slow to become ready.\n. @Maximus5 you are right, the real console has the same problem.\nThere is no problem, though, when trying to run commands from raw git bash.\nSo I used ProcessExplorer, as you suggested, to see what's going on.\nI discovered that when it's slow in ConEmu, there is a process named MsMpEng.exe that takes quite some CPU. It seems to be the anti malware thing in Windows. I repaired ConEmu as @glhez described, and went through the same series of commands, and everything ran smoothly as expected. I found that MsMpEng.exe didn't spike nearly as much as before repair. Could it be anything related to program signing?\nLet me know if there's anything more I can help with.\n. Forgive my ignorance, by raw git bash I meant \"bash not wrapped in ConEmu\"\n\n. It comes with git installation for windows, from https://git-scm.com/. I thought you'd know. Sorry.\nJust checked....\nIt is surprisingly just cmd.exe, I don't know what else information I can provide.\nSo the \"raw bash\" I ran is just a  .lnk for C:\\Users\\chenp\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\git-bash.exe --cd-to-home. When using this thing, running the commands that could be slow in ConEmu, for some reason, wouldn't be slow.\n. I understand that it could be annoying to you to receive seemingly random bug reports. I'll try and dig further. I'll report here if I get anything valuable. Thanks for the responses!\n. OK @glhez @Maximus5 I've got somewhere.\nI excluded several executables that come with git installation, that I saw taking significant time fraction being the active process (displayed on ConEmu status bar, thanks!), from real-time protection.\nHere's the list\n- bash.exe\n- dirname.exe\n- git.exe\n- perl.exe\n- sed.exe\n- sh.exe\n- uname.exe\nAfter doing so, ConEmu runs blazing fast again :)\nI tried but couldn't find a better solution that doesn't require whitelisting a bunch of process names.\n. @Maximus5 no I didn't try the rollback approach, since repair actually did do something, I already assumed it's not ConEmu that's doing things wrong. Still have no idea why MS Defender pays extra attention to all the git commands after restart, though.\n@glhez That's weird, it worked live for me. I literally had both Settings and ConEmu open, trying the process names one by one.\n. @glhez ah that makes sense.\n. ",

    "hypersw": "Checking:\n1) Take Visual Studio version 10+ (9 won't do yet). I'm trying on 12 and 14.\n2) Place the .nuget into some folder.\n3) Go to VS | Tools | Options | Nuget Package Manager | Package Sources. Add your folder as another source.\n4) Create a new C# project (say, Class Library, does not matter here).\n5) In Solution Explorer, on the References node under the project, choose Context Menu | Manage Nuget Packages.\n6) Here UI depends on VS (nuget extension) version. Generally, you should choose \"browse\" / \"online\" section of that UI for installing new ones, select your new nuget source among the sources, and install the package.\n7) It should add a line to packages.config file, and an <Import /> element to .csproj pointing to the .Targets file from the nuget package.\n8) When you rebuild the project, the ConEmu files from the package should get copied to the outdir of the project.\nFor now, that's the most useful outcome of the package: if you're building some C# stuff with ConEmu, that's how you get its binaries delivered (same on your machine or whoever takes the project from source control and hits \"Restore Packages\" in VS, or they can be restored on build). Once it gets uploaded to nuget.org, you'd just have it listed in the packages dialog out of the box.\n. Oops, looks like I've been thinking up on which package Id to proposed, so it got different names at different places. Sorry for that. Up to you to decide on the final one, but make sure the .Targets file is named by the package, otherwise it won't get wired up.\n. On the package contents.\nFor the starter, I've added (almost) all the stuff from conemu .7z shipment ;-) Considering this is semantically the base nuget for all possible uses in C#-based third-party apps, not only the winforms control from conemu-inside, what would be the useful set of files?\nThe license is linked as an URL in the package description (that's a convenient source of information for those picking up nuget packages for the app and deciding whether it's a go or a no-go, I can tell by my experience). Adding a file to the package content as well won't do any harm, I just don't have any opinion on this matter.\n. I've rebased my branch over yours, so it results in just two commits now, but github ain't catching the idea and shows lots of unrelated changes. So I'd close and reopen this PR anew.\n. Yep, been thinking of that.\nWith choco, it's about the only possible package. Just installs the app, and that's it.\nWith nuget, we'd also have ConEmu.WinForms at the least. Maybe smth for WPF as well, but it would be harder to write. (Joining packages for WinForms and core executables does not look like a good idea, they're distinctively different things, and executables will update more often \u2014 so let's have them separate.)\nSo one is ConEmu-WinForms, and the other is ConEmu-What? Would be confusing in the packages list if it's just \"ConEmu\", should tell why there're two and what each one does. Is the shorter one more official? Is it an alternative? Also users might intuitively pick the shorter one probably, which is not what they need in a C# project. As for now, it seems the core package won't often be the installation target on itself (unlike choco), probably other packages referencing it, hence no need to give it the fanciest name possible.\nProbably .Console does not convey the idea the best way. What could it be?\nConEmu.CoreExecutables? ConEmu.Executables? ConEmu.Core (that resembles a popular naming pattern for essential stuff which is though not usually installed directly)?\n. I'll debug how it blends in into csproj. Could you attach the version as you're getting from your build as a file here?\n. I'd prefer the nupkg as is, to be sure I'm testing the same thing.\n. I'll try within a few hours' time.\n. Yes, I see.\nLet's decide over the set of files which might be useful in this nuget. What do you think?\nFor the task, say, \"conemu-inside and all other possble programmatical uses from within a C#/C++/whatever-else-msbuild-proj-based project\" (they all support nugets the same).\nI'll set up the nuget to pick those specific files, and will make sure the same list gets into bindir.\n. Is the layout important, or can they be all placed in the top-level folder?\nI mean, it's ConEmu folder in BinDir, then ConEmu.exe in it and another ConEmu folder. As there're just so few files, might go well right in the single folder. Will it work?\n. #482 \n. Nuget Id has to be updated in that secret deploy script as well.\n. Good. When's the next release? Supposedly it lands on nuget.org as well?\n. As of the encodings, for this specific repo GE keeps thinking its messages are in CP-1251, even though they look like misdecoded UTF-8 rather.

I also recorded a small video showing what happens when the console stops responding. Can i mail a link to your email id?. @Maximus5 ConEmu got stuck again today in one of the consoles. Also, while I have the RealConsole opened up, it adds another window I have to Alt+Tab to and the text output in the RealConsole is very small to read easily.\nI wanted to know if there is a way to re-attach a RealConsole to another Conemu console, or create a new Conemu console which can keep a RealConsole running?. Huh... While investigating if there was an \"fasten\"/\"attach\" functionality in ConEmu, I  pressed the lock button on the toolbar which says \"Alternative Mode is ON\" (I still haven't figured out what is the Alternative Mode's use). And suddenly my ConEmu console sync'd up with the RealConsole output. \nI think this bug is due to user error. Actually Win+A is for opening up the Action Center in Windows. While running ConEmu, it is for toggling this alternative mode. So, whenever I try to see my notifications in Action center, it locks up the active ConEmu console. \ud83d\ude02 I think I'll just disable the \"Alternative mode\" shortcut.\nSorry for all the trouble..

Thanks for the help to both of you though, I really appreciate it if someone could help me get it fixed.\nAny suggestions on what else I could try? I'm clueless at this point.\n. It was already setup on 65001 sadly enough :(\nEDIT: I'm thinking about recompiling vim alltogether to see if that changes anything, start with a fresh install and see where it goes. My problem is that I've forgot how I installed it in the first place, the only thing I could find on my computer was a executable installer. Which might just be the reason why it's not working the way it's supposed to. I just don't know how to uninstall it from this point on. There is no makefile or anything in my /usr/share/vim/vim74 if there was I could've just done a make uninstall... Is it safe to do a rm -rf on /usr/share/vim and remove the vim.exe and xxd.exe from the binary folder?\nEDIT2: I've done the above and compiled vim with the following configuration:\n./configure --enable-pythoninterp --enable-perlinterp --enable-rubyinterp --enable-gui=no --without-x --enable-multibyte --prefix=/usr\nNow when I try adding the 4 lines mentioned in my previous post, my entire vim turns grey.\nIt looks like this:\n\nI do seem to have my cursor though, which is already a step forward I guess.\nany idea why it doesn't display properly? Have I done something wrong during configuration?\n. I've tried all different terms in vim and some seem to do weird stuff with characters while others display it like in my screenshot.\nAnd yes I've tried compiling vim in cygwin, is this wrong? Should I be using a executable installer instead? Won't I lose support for python ruby and perl then?\nI'll try removing my currently compiled install of vim and use xylographe's linked executable once I get home. I'm still at work currently.\n. That's what I was using previously which was confirmed by xylographe. Which didn't seem to work hence I thought maybe I should try and compile it myself. Anyways I'll download the official vim installer and try it again but I doubt it'll be any different then before. If that fails I'll try downloading xylographe's suggestion of the gvim installer and see if that one works. My previous post showed that with the official vim installed I had those weird blue characters with a clean .vimrc and no plugins.\nEDIT: sorry for being such a pain in the ass. I've installed gvim74.exe installer into c:\\Program Files(x86)\\vim\\vim74 and included it to my environment path. Although I can't seem to run vim from my conemu cygwin terminal it says command not found. Should I try opening vim in conemu without using cygwin? Also I'm not quite sure which HOME path it now uses, I'll try to find out.\nEDIT2: I've opened up vim.exe in conemu from c:\\Program Files(x86)\\vim\\vim74 and it shows weird characters like before but this time different ones. I have no plugins nor does it have a vimrc file. I also can't see which home path it's using because it's outputted with strange characters. Here is a screenshot:\n\nIf you have time could you perhaps help me out through teamviewer or join.me or any other desktop sharing program? Maybe it's better if you see for yourself. I don't know what I'm doing wrong :S\nI'm sorry for wasting all your precious time I'm sure you're a bussy man or woman.\n. Sorry for the double post. I've tried reinstalling the official vim version and let it generate a vimrc file for me. I think that there is something wrong with vim picking up my environment path in windows. This time when I opened up vim I got a strange path in my vim when I started it. Showing me a system32 dll and something what appears to be visual studio. I'm going to try and set my environment path back to the default and save all the other paths I've added through the years. See if that changes something.\nAlthough I can't seem to find anything like visual studio in my environment path which is weird. \nMaybe something else is going on entirely and I don't exactly know what.\nHere is a screenshot of my current situation:\n\nI hope someone can get an idea on what is happening on my system with this latest screenshot.\nPerhaps some software conflict?\nI can't seem to get much help from google either on this issue :/\n. Thanks for the suggestion Maximus5, I've made a post in the vim_use mailing list linking to this page.\nI'm hoping someone can help me out on this.\nI was thinking since vim is registering with OLE maybe this has something to do with that. Is there some way I can clean up the OLE or am I missunderstanding what OLE is? I have no idea :/\n. Sorry for the double post, but I've decided to use the cygwin connector with a custom compiled vim version in cygwin. Everything seems to work fine now. My cursor is properly being displayed and 256 colors seem to work in both terminal and vim. I'm very happy that you've made the cygwin connector it's awesome :D\n. ",

I was able to solve this using ShellLinkPlus. I'll keep a copy around in case the link goes offline.\n1. Create a shortcut to ConEmu.exe (by dragging the file to the desktop while pressing Ctrl and Shift)\n2. Open the shortcut to ConEmu.exe with ShellLinkPlus and copied the AppUserModelID of Maximus5.ConEmu.65e5e8abd9dc7c7e7764bf48b6084339\n3. Close ShellLinkPlus\n4. Create a custom shortcut with C:\\Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu.exe /loadcfgfile \"C:\\Tools\\ConEmu\\ConEmu-%COMPUTERNAME%-detached.xml\" pinned to the Task Bar (e.g. drag and edit properties)\n5. Open the custom shortcut with ShellLinkPlus\n6. Paste the copied AppUserModelID into the custom shortcut\n7. Click \"Create Shortcut\"\n8. Bliss ;-)\n. Yes, the pinned ConEmu doesn't have arguments like /loadcfgfile. As soon as I set them the AppUserModelID is gone and I have two icons in the task bar: One for the pin, another for the just started ConEmu with parameters.\n\nI noticed ConEmu's AppUserModelID is different between machines. Chrome's is static. What's the rationale behind that?\nExplorer not setting parameters might be due to the fact that if you pin say Word that was started with a docx file (winword.exe foo.docx), you would always open Word with that file. If you delete the docx, people would see weird errors like \"file not found\".\n. I just tried that:\n1. Opened ConEmu, dismissed the initial config dialog (I don't use ConEmu.xml)\n2. Pinned the icon\n3. Closed ConEmu\n4. Opened the pinned link with ShellLinkPlus -> No AppUserModelID\n5. Downloaded this reg file and installed it, also no AppUserModelID on the shortcut's detail tab\n. Tried something else:\n1. Opened ConEmu.exe /loadcfgfile <some XML>\n2. Pinned the icon\n3. Closed ConEmu\n4. Opened the pinned link with ShellLinkPlus -> had an AppUserModelID\n5. Changed the link properties to have /loadcfgfile <some XML> as it got lost during pinning\n6. Saved the link, then reopened to check if the AppUserModelID still is there and it was\nCan you explain?\n. Thanks, that explains why there wasn't an ID for the first shortcut I created.\nSo the simplified process is this, right?\n1. Launch ConEmu with desired arguments\n2. Pin it -> link with AppUserModelID but without arguments is created\n3. Change arguments of link as desired (as launched in step 1) -> AppUserModelID should be kept\n. Thanks!\n. Seems to be fixed in 171025 \ud83d\ude0a.. Seems to be working now, I did several seq 1000 tests!. That yields the Windows path, no conversion at all for me with -.. -cur_console:m:: yields :/something. \ud83d\udc4d . Excellent, that works!. @Maximus5 \n\nWhen you use proper task with connector/wslbridge you may see proper colors and underlined text in both cases.\n\nDo you mean by \"proper\" that I would need to run WSL zsh like this (task contents)?\nbatch\n\"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt /usr/bin/zsh --interactive --login\nUnfortunately I can't because in this case the console window stays empty.\nOn the other hand, WSL bash works:\nbatch\n\"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt\n. @Maximus5 Could you please comment on my last question?\n\nDo you mean by \"proper\" that I would need to run WSL zsh like this (task contents)?. Aha, -t did the trick. Many thanks! (Still, lots of these options seem like black magic to me as bash doesn't require -t.). > Bare --wsl implies it.\n\nThat's strange, just tested again. --wsl -t works while bare --wsl does not (the shell blocks and I need to kill it). Can you please verify?. Just the normal zsh startup (mind the -t):\n\"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" --wsl -t -cur_console:pm:/mnt /usr/bin/zsh --interactive --login\nThis works, without -t the shell never gets into a state where I can enter text. I can Ctrl+C to exit the shell and close the ConEmu tab.. Of course what? And what do you mean by \"bare --wsl\"?. That doesn't make it clearer to me. You said earlier, that --wsl implies -t. Why do I see a difference in behavior if I leave out -t?. So -cur_console:pm:/mnt makes it non-bare?. I hope I get it now:\nBy \"bare\" --wsl you mean that no non-internal arguments come after --wsl. If one adds a shell to be run (/usr/bin/zsh --interactive --login in my case), this makes it non-bare.\nFor bash I don't specify a shell, hence \"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt is bare, despite the internally processed -cur_console:pm:/mnt.

But I thinking about that each tab of ConEmu can execute a different clink.bat with profile argument as i.e. that tab name. Maybe that solution can work. Something like that:\nFor Tab1:\n@\"%~dp0clink_load.bat\" --profile tab1 inject\nFor Tab2:\n@\"%~dp0clink_load.bat\" --profile tab2 inject\n. Maybe I'm not explain very well :-)\nWhen user create new console tab in ConEmu there is two tabs with default names: \"<1> cmd\", \"<2> cmd\". Before launching new cmd with Clink option, ConEmu create temp.bat for executing clink with profile argument. This argument can be for example name of tab (in this case it will be \"cmd\") or with some ID. So in \"<1> cmd\", \"<2> cmd\" tabs I have the same command history from clink. Now, when I create a new tab with default name \"<3> cmd\" and rename that tab for new name \"<3> test\" then clink has a profile test with his own command history.

    "plastikat": "Thanks, I'll try that. Though these 'alpha' words always repel me )\n. 1. But section \"How to use connector\" of this page says that I should \"Unpack this file to [my] bin folder...\". That was exactly what I did, except I used conemu-msys2-32.exe from ConEmu pack archive, not from a separate download. The only \"git bash\"-related default task ConEmu creates for me is\n%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe --no-cd --command=/usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i\nDoes this task use connector? I figure it does not, but I might be wrong... My ultimate goal was to enable 256 color mode. The default task above does not enable it.\n\n\nconemu-msys2-32.exe was the only file I have copied \"to my bin folder\". I attached the dir output just to give you an idea what this \"bin\" directory of my Git version contains - so I am definitely not breaking anything.\n\n\nAlso I have succeeded doing all the same steps with the same version of ConEmu, but with \"Git for Windows\" 1.9.4 (I used conemu-msys-32.exe with that Git version, of course).\n\n\nIf the page \"How to use connector\" is outdated, I would appreciate if you'd provide more details on how to manually run \"msys terminal connector\".. First of all, I should say that eventually, following your hints, I've sorted things out and managed to update the command of \"git bash\" default task. It works now.\nAnd yes, I have read that link and must say I had no idea I need to press that button from time to time... My problem was in that I've accidentally moved conemu-msys2-32.exe to \"git/bin\" directory instead of copying it, which prevented the task from being updated properly. Things have worked as expected after I've moved the file back to ConEmu directory.\nBut you must agree that it's not really my fault to be directed to those outdated pages by web search engines (e.g. Google) when looking for \"256 colors in ConEmu\". I've just tried to follow the instructions.\n\nDo you use Git-for-Windows v2.x? Seems like.\n\nActually I've stated that clearly in the \"Versions\" section of the initial report, no need to guess. And the \"Git for Windows\" version I've mentioned there does install msys-2.0.dll in both \"git/bin\" and \"git/usr/bin\" directories. Why would I've made that up? You should not, in the first place, presume your users as being some vicious liars.\nI'd also like to note that \"Add default tasks...\" button's name is IMHO a bit misleading. Something like \"Add/refresh default tasks\" would maybe be better.\nAnd thank you for your hard work! You're doing a good job since conhost is still truly awful (and it seems unlikely to ever change).. Things happen in mysterious ways... Your hints led me to investigate why these files are in my \"git/bin\" directory. It turned out there are issues with 32-bit \"Git for Windows\". Along the way I stumbled across this PR, explaining why I do have these files. While looking at that code, however, I've figured that in fact I only have them due to an error (as I am on 8.1, not 10), which resulted in my own PR. You never know what's around the corner ). Man! That's exactly what I needed! I had this feeling I've seen this functionality somewhere, turns out I've been searching the wrong place ) And although defining a dynamic title (similar to tabs) would probably be a little more flexible and convenient, this static -Title argument fits me perfectly. Thanks, you've saved my day again!. I've applied a closer scrutiny. Seems like it works as expected with any hotkey assigned (not just default ones), but only when Focus in child windows is on... When this setting is off, my original report still holds true (though I'll amend it to avoid confusion).. > Yes, modifiers can't be used as single hotkeys.\nWell, that's a pity. But not a show-stopper, of course.\n\nI don't understand your question about left/right generalization...\n\nHere's some additional details. I open a modifier drop-down list and click on RCtrl there. But, instead of this specific value, a na\u00efve Ctrl (which is left/right agnostic) gets selected for the field.\nIt sometimes helps to resolve some hotkey conflicts or simply precludes false positives, when you bind one combination strictly to the \"right\" modifier (RCtrl+H, for example) and, optionally, another strictly to the \"left\" one (LCtrl+H); these combinations are then treated as distinct. I hope this provides some clarification.. Thanks for the explanation about WinAPI restrictions. Initially I've observed the behavior with \"Local\" type, but at the time I didn't even think it's type-dependent...\nI've done some additional tests and now I see that strict modifiers are still supported with \"User\" and \"Macro\" types, which is good to know..

First, thanks a lot for reading, for trying TeraTerm (I'm impressed that you fact-checked).\nSorry If I'm insisting but yes, after using \"Reset Terminal\" screen is completely blank, and yes, the prompt is not displayed anymore. But know what ? Just by pressing a single \"enter\" the prompt is displayed again.\nExample cases :\n1. When for example inspecting a real-time log (tail -f), if I have already millions of scrolled lines, being able to visually \"clear\" everything without stopping the current command is invaluable !\n2. When developping an app in read-modify-execute mode, how many times did I accidentally scrolled too far and mistook former run output with the last output ? Being able to clear the terminal completely prevents such pains.\nWithout such a feature, the only way to clearly separate batches of console output is by making enough \u00abvisual space\u00bb by, for ex., your aforementioned \u00abctrl+L\u00bb or by keeping \"enter\" pressed for a long time. Both methodes are not very effective at preventing \"lost in scroll history\" situations :-( \nAs a fellow developper, I hope the examples I give will ring some bells.\nBtw this feature is so useful that it's also available in default Terminal app of standard Ubuntu :\n\nConvenientely mapped to F1 : so perfect !\nObviously, using this command while in a curses-heavy interactive shell application like vim is a bad idea.

Yes, that's what I'm saying :)\nWhen restarting after an update, the shell points at at the default location. It would be nice if it remembered the directory that was in use prior to closing.\ne.g.\n- ConEmu configured to open in \"C:\\myDefaultDir\" by default.\n- Open ConEmu in \"C:\\someDirectory\" via explorer integration (i.e. not the default directory).\n- Prompted to update.\n- ConEmu restarts in \"C:\\myDefaultDir\", when it would be nice if it actually opened \"C:\\someDirectory\".\nI don't need it to remember the last directory that was in use all the time, as that is not useful to me - just specifically in the case of updates.

    "rjycnfynby": "Hi Maximus,\nI have the same issue with latest ConEmu using Cygwin + Mosh + Tmux. It is\nvery noticeable if you open something like midnight commander. Please let\nme know what data you need.\n. OK. Let me try to describe one of the easiest ways to reproduce this. It is basically the same way as @ndbeals mentioned. I was just too lazy to describe it before he started this thread.\n1. Install latest \"Cygwin for 64-bit versions of Windows\" and ConEmu (currently 150813g 64)\n2. Jump into tmux session \"tmux attach || tmux new\" via ssh from Cygwin64 sh.exe (ConEmu Predefined task is \"set CHERE_INVOKING=1 & %ConEmuDrive%\\cygwin64\\bin\\sh.exe --login -i -new_console:C:\"%ConEmuDrive%\\cygwin64\\Cygwin.ico\"\") and start two vertical windows using [CTRL]+[b], [%] run Midnight Commander \"mc\" in both\n3. Switch to the right window by [CTRL]+[b], [Right] or [Left] if required and press [CTRL]+[o] to hide MC panels which will corrupt the text in left window until you refresh it (see picture below)\n\nExpectations: Text in left window shouldn't be corrupted.\nNotes: It is not the only way to reproduce this. There are lots of smal glitches when pseudo-graphical interface like ncurses takes place. Sometimes tmux lower panel gets completely overwritten and lines shifts up or down. Using htop or mc is just easier to reproduce. Problem exist only when I'm using cygwin\\bin\\sh.exe in ConEmu.\nLet me know if you need more details.\nBTW, I'm joining to @ndbeals appreciation for your work. It is awesome! Thank you.\n. ",
    "ndbeals": "My apologies @Maximus5 , Last night when I made this issue I was quite tired, no excuse for a poor bug report. I'll give a step by step to explain better, requirements are a linux server to connect to via ssh, tmux, htop and a windows machine.\nI also tested with every possible combination of different ssh.exe's (ssh.exe from git-for-windows and plink.exe from PuTTY) and different interpreters too (windows conhost.exe (cmd), git-for-windows bash.exe and the sh.exe)\n1. Start a ConEmu window using either conhost.exe (one of the default tasks) or bash.exe\n2. Using either program, make an ssh connection to a different machine (ssh user@address, nothing fancy)\n3. Once connected to a the remote server, install htop and tmux (apt-get install htop tmux)\n4. Assuming default tmux commands and controls, start a new tmux session via \"tmux new\", it should automatically attach you when you create it, if not, use \"tmux a\" to attach.\n5. Once inside tmux, vertically split the view into two command line views by pressing: Control-B to allow tmux commands to be entered, and then press Shift + 5(%) to split them vertically.\n6. There should now be a left pane and a right pane, your text input should be focused on the right side pane, if not, switch to it with Control-B + arrow keys.\n7. Run the program \"htop\" in the right pane, some of the output should overlap and break the layout.\n8. For definite proof of it breaking, when inside htop, press F1 to go to the htop settings panel, it will certainly break layout then.\nI'm also available via slack or gitter or irc if you'd like me to clarify further, I kind of suck at explaining.\nThanks again.\n. This is happening under ConEmu 160313.\n. I am not, however this isn't a bug with cygwin, It's a bug with conemu. the same ssh programs don't have the same layout issue with mintty, or git-bash (which uses mintty). And putty (using plink.exe) has no issues with the layout breaking in the way I described above. \nThough I'm looking into connector right now and will try it out soon.\n. Woops misclick, However I must be missing something. Is this not an issue with ANSI X3.64 compliance?\nI am reading these links you post, but there are some contradicting pages. I'm coming to the realization now that ConEmu is not a posix compliant terminal emulator, just a windows console emulator. Though the website is a little misleading where, in the screenshots page, there are images of GNU and Linux tools in use, and features such as xterm and ANSI colours. \n. Using the connector fixed the issue, Thank you for your patience.\n. ",

In my example it is much bellow under recommended level 1.3 vs 4.5. \nThere is you can see it: http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#rgb%28181%2C137%2C0%29-on-rgb%2849%2C130%2C164%29\nMore information:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast\nI do not know how to exactly correct such things, but the first idea is dynamically shift the text color to increase the contract value.\ne.g. (my case)\nbg: rgb(49,130,164), text: rgb(181,137,0), contrast-ratio is 1.3\ntext \nrgb(181,137,0) -> hsl(45,100%,35%), \nshift the h to reach the maximum contrast-ratio for the current bg,\nhsl(63,100%,35%) -> rgb(170,179,0)\nresult \nbg: rgb(49,130,164), text: rgb(170,179,0), contrast-ratio is 1.9 (not a good, but much more better)\nhttp://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#rgb%28170%2C179%2C0%29-on-rgb%2849%2C130%2C164%29\n. Hi, How about new feature \"Adjust contrast of indistinguishable text\"? :)\n. >You don't believe me now? Where did I get the correct ANSI sequences (???), from ConEmu of course. menu Edit > ANSI sequences checked and the menu Edit > Copy All and paste to a gist.\nTo be clear. Then you did it (Copy All) the ConEmu converted the screen colors to ANSI sequences. It does not mean that the colors on the screen were generated with ANSI sequences. \n. And? Plugins installed and worked. I upgrade Far to the latest stable version (Far Manager v3.0 build 5200 x64). Still not working.. \n. Did it. The same result :( Select/unselect files and folder.\nLooks like the issue/feature of the latest Windows Insider build.. ConEmu-srv-640.log\nConEmu-srv-27948.log\nConEmu-gui-15576.log\nBTW, I realize that drag&drop is also doesn't work. (I can drag the selected files only inside ConEmu windows area). :)\n\nAfter long click on Documentation folder\n\nand log\nConEmu-gui-28484.log\n. \n. Hmm.... \nDo you need all from the following locations?\nC:\\Users\\horto\\AppData\\Local\\Far Manager\\Profile\nC:\\Users\\horto\\AppData\\Roaming\\Far Manager\\Profile\nOr some specific files? \n. >Alternatively, you may try Far with clean profile on your PC.\nGreat idea.  I create the Far.exe.ini with local profile and run it (in test location ). The same result.\nProfile.zip\nFar.exe.ini.txt\n. ",

This is usually done from .bat after some initialization, like Msys-shell launchers.\nCurrently all those .bat-files are broken if ConEmu is used.\nSomeone may use start /min to do some background task.\nIsn't it possible to intercept call from \"start\" command and add prefix ConEmu.exe -cmd to the string?\n. @Maximus5 If mintty is not present, launcher fall back to start sh....\nI don't know for which reason start ... was used for console application, but it's perfectly legal and expected to work correctly. From my point of view - this isn't a bad design, but this is not optimal design.\nCould I ask to rise priority of this bug as this silently breaks .bat-files and results in unexpected behavior and hard-detectable failures?\nIs it possible to call GetEnvironmentStringsW() and pass result as parameter to CreateProcess() or modify environment of started process by some other way?\n.

    "dylanaraps": "Support for \\033[14t isn't a necessity as we gracefully fallback to displaying ascii art if it isn't available but hearing that the other two are supported is great!\nWe're using w3m-img to display full-color images in the terminal and the sizing for it takes a pixel w/h value (100x100, etc). What we do with \\033[14t is calculate the user's font width/height so that the image sizing can be dynamic based on the terminal window size.\nI'll make a note for ConEmu users that they need to use the cygwin/msys connector to get the script to function properly.\nThanks for the speedy reply.\n. I just setup the cygwin/msys connecter and everyone is working now!\nSupport for \\033[14t would be nice but it isn't a necessity and if you don't want to add support for it that's fine too.\nThanks for all of the help. :)\n. Hey, thanks for implementing \\033[14t, I appreciate it!\nBecause these escape sequences print after the shell prompt we have read the escape sequence as user input. When the escape sequence isn't supported the read loop hangs waiting for user input.\n\\033[c is more widely supported then \\033[14t and \\033[6n so we use the output from \\033[c as the delimiter in the read loop.

Can't say at the moment, what else seems to cause the assertion to fail.\nHere's a zip with logs and screenshots, taken on ConEmu ver. 160329.\nConEmuLogs.zip\n. Also, after updating ConEmu to latest version 160403a the issue still remains.\n. Sorry for late response, but apparently that commit you made didn't really fix the problem. \nI cannot recall the precise ConEmu version when this changed, but on ver. 160515 [64] {Preview} the situation is following. \nWhen I type Ctrl+D or exit in the stermc SSH console and I had used Midnight Commander during this session, then CPU usage jumps to 100% and the machine completely stops responding. This, as far as I've found, may be \"resolved\" only with a hard reset of the PC. I have tried to wait it over, but after 30 minutes nothing's changed, so I still had to hard reset the PC.\nConEmu crash dump doesn't appear after this.\nWhen I type Ctrl+D or exit in the stermc SSH console and Midnight Commander has not been launched during the session, everything's fine.\nAlso, in case when mc has been launched, closing that tab in ConEmu (i.e. right-click the tab -> Close tab) works fine.\nAnother note, if I run stermc from standard Windows console, without ConEmu, everything is also fine.\nPS: I have a gut feeling that this might somehow be connected with colours, but I cannot really investigate this deeper at the moment. Primarily because of the need to hard-reset very often. I will, however, do anything specific you need me to in order to fix this.\n. Another interesting thing I've just found. \nWhen performing the \"worst case scenario\" from a default {Shells::cmd} shell inside ConEmu (i.e. manually executing stermc command with proper parameters), then ConEmu process starts using 25% of CPU (a single core, apparently). The machine remains usable in this case, and it's possible to kill ConEmu process via Process Explorer. \n. ",

Hi guys, please ignore my previous post. It's NOT conemu issue. \nThe issue: I started Everything with normal privilege. The default startup newly-created console is PowerShell with administrator privilege. So es.exe in conemu will be stuck and I started PowerShell with normal privilege works well. It made me feel that it was conemu stuck issue.\nSolution: start Eveything and es.exe with the same privilege.. ",

Yes. the close was accidental.  LOL!  MY BAD.  I closed this as a duplicate and then the other ticket was closed as a duplicate of this.  Haven't had a lot of time to track or debug the issue given that I started a new role.. Just checked it. It is still broken.. Apologies for the delayed response, I've been working on other projects...  I've tested this with the latest \n190303 preview build and it no longer seems to be a problem.\nClosing for now, but will reopen the issue if maybe I just haven't tested enough.  Maybe it's just working correctly for the very short term.. Ran into the issue... Will attempt redo of logs.\n. Added additional logs.\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AqeEi3P_II50g2_TwNvGZWkiTqPZ. This is strange since WSLTTY is MINTTY.  The only difference is that it's running the windows linux subsystem's bash instead of cygwin's bash.\nAt first glance, you seemed to be correct in that it is only WSLTTY that is affected. Even I was fooled for a minute or two.\nHowever, upon further analysis, I've noticed the following subtle difference. Cygwin's mintty puts a small blank space at the top of the screen while WSLTTY does not.  Essentially, what is happening here is that the extra space at the top of a new terminal window in cygwin's mintty is masking the fact that the third party app is being rendered higher than it should be.\n\n\n\n. I can also note that the latest stable 161206 version does not have the same issue and renders the WSLTTY terminal correctly.. Here is another photo of the issue. When highlighted, you can clearly see that there is a new line above the prompt.  This is with a fresh profile.  I've wiped conemu from my machine and conducted a fresh install.  With the exception of the modified task for WSLTTY and MINTTY, the configs are stock.\n\nIt would appear that this extra space is just a new line character since it can be highlighted.\nCan you check your minnty terminal for a new line character before the first prompt?  This still doesn't eliminate some other windows setting.. Here is a render of my minnty using the latest stable 161206.\n\nYou can clearly see that there is not cut off white space at the top of the screen.. ",

    "Ordspilleren": "Yes, that is the issue. When bash is launched through ConEmu, the arrow keys never work, not for command history or in Vim / Nano. Adding -new_console:p1 did not work.\n. @lennylxx It is not just a wrapper, it IS bash. Try typing bash.exe --help. Many of the traditional bash options found in there will work. As for installing / uninstalling, bash doesn't do that at all. A separate utility called lxrun does all of that with i.a. lxrun /install and lxrun /uninstall. As such, since bash.exe is quite literally bash ported to a windows executable, options like -l -i will work fine in theory. However, as @reflog found out, the -l command will return mesg: /dev/tty: Operation not permitted, probably because Microsoft hasn't implemented handling for that yet.\nTo resolve this issue, I have personally tried to change most of the keyboard configuration options inside Ubuntu itself to see if it is simply because Ubuntu itself doesn't know how to handle the inputs, but nothing seems to work. I'd assume the issue is that bash.exe expects a format of inputs that only the improved Windows Console Host in this Insider Preview can provide. Adding to that, it's not only the arrow keys that don't work, the del, end, home etc. keys don't work either.\n. @Maximus5 Thank you very much for the workaround, it seems to work beautifully!\nThe only issue that remains is the lack of support for international characters like \u00e6\u00f8\u00e5. This does not work in the official Bash on Ubuntu on Windows either, so I imagine it's up to Microsoft to fix that.\n. @Maximus5 I have personally just named mine {Bash::bash} since that is the most descriptive, short name I could come up with.

The referenced issue in that thread fixed Docker but there was no further talk of the issue with git-bash.\nI don't think it's unreasonable to assume they're related. And again, I fail to see how expected behavior applying in all the contexts I mentioned but failing in this one program is a bug with the feature unless I'm misunderstanding something about the meaning of \"Windows console emulator\".\nAnd there's no need for the excessive punctuation and bolded excerpts, I can follow what you say just fine without them.\n. As I said in that comment, the referenced issue in that thread fixed Docker but there was no further talk of the issue with git-bash, not Docker. The issue with git-bash that a series of comments in that thread mentioned mirrors the exact behavior I'm seeing now.\n. ",

In the ConEmu settings I've set \"Paste mode 2\" to \"Do nothing\".\nArrow keys are working fine (in e.g. nano), but not in vim. When in \"insert\" mode and I hit the arrow keys, nothing happens. I can use the hjkl keys in \"command\" mode as a workaround.\nSo I followed the wiki instructions and edited .bashrc and .vimrc. Still no arrow keys in vim. What am I missing?\n. > Does vim works in Bash4Windows started outside of ConEmu?\nYes. And arrow keys works fine when running vim in the Microsoft-bundled \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\" console. I'm only have this issue when using ConEmu.\n\nHave you set xterm for vim term?\n\nIn bash, echo $TERM yields xterm. But I don't have this set explicitly in my .vimrc. I now tried setting set term=xterm in my .vimrc but that didn't make any difference.\n\nHave you even change proper vimrc?\n\nNot sure what you mean. I've started out from an empty .vimrc and entered stuff one by one. Never have the arrow keys worked when using the vim/Bash4Windows/ConEmu combo, regardless of the .vimrc contents.\n. > What does :echo $MYVIMRC print?\nThat points to my .vimrc: /home/fredrik/.vimrc.\n\nAnyway, what did you entered in vimrc?\n\nIt's completely empty, to make it easier to find what's causing this.\nI realized just now, that when I'm in vim's \"insert\" mode and I hit any of the arrow keys, I'm taken out of \"insert\" mode and into \"command\" mode. So basically, the arrow keys do the same thing as the Esc key. \nThat's strange!\n. I stopped using conemu a while back because I couldn't get arrow keys to work in vim (bash on Windows) and decided to return today to give it another go. Still doesn't work for me out of the box with a fresh install of conemu 64-bit + vim in bash.\nThe arrow keys work fine in bash itself, and in other editors such as nano.

    "rprichard": "FWIW, I just noticed the same problem affecting winpty (https://github.com/rprichard/winpty/issues/82).  It looks like there's a new (undocumented) console input mode flag, 0x200.  When it's enabled, and when certain keys are pressed down, the console generates an escape sequence (encoded as multiple key event records) rather than generate a single bKeyDown=TRUE event record.  The bKeyDown=FALSE record is generated normally, as before.\n. @miniksa @Maximus5 FWIW, this VSCode/winpty issue seems related: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19665.  ConEmu is broken in exactly the same way (screenshot in this comment, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19665#issuecomment-287248500).  I wrote a test case demonstrating the new (broken?) behavior as of Win10 v15048.. This issue could be responsible for this VSCode issue (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22616).  If I start VSCode from ConEmu (e.g. by running Code.exe), then:\n\nConEmu does not hook the VSCode processes\nThe ConEmuANSI variable is set to ON in the VSCode processes.\nWhen VSCode starts its integrated terminal, it uses winpty to create a hidden console (a non-ConEmu \"RealConsole\").\nwinpty, unlike ConEmu, does not hook WriteConsole et al to add VT/100 color escape support.\nPHP-based components see that ConEmuANSI is set and write escapes, which are visible to the user.\n\nA major caveat: I don't know if this scenario is the one causing the VSCode issue, and it might not be.  It doesn't really matter, though, because I've reproduced it myself.\nI'm probably going to end up filtering out ConEmuANSI in winpty, but I still think this is a ConEmu bug.. ",

    "rogerdielrton": "\n\"Frozen\" means \"unresponsive screen\": when you typing, no characters appears on screen, nothing changes on screen (on the embedded PuTTY terminal).\nMaybe is a PuTTY problem. Is a fact that there is no problem if, instead of PuTTY, I use CMD or CygWin (or if I use PuTTY dettached from ConEmu).\n. Here is a screenshot of my desktop:\n\nThe active ConEmu tab shows a PuTTY session with a machine named \"suw1pre\". There is another three PuTTY tabs (\"suw2pre\", \"jwk1pre\", and \"jwk2pre\"). Also there is MS-DOS cmd tabs (\"cmd\", \"lubuntu1\", \"lubuntu2\") and a CygWin tab (\"CW1\"). When I type in something in, for example, \"suw1pre\", no characters appear on screen and appears con another tab (for example, on \"jwk2pre\").\nThe duration of this abnormal behaviour is some seconds: I switch to another tab for typing characters and, after coming back to the initial tab, this is \"unlocked\" (I can type again).\n\nIf you have PuTTY and SSH connection to several machines, you can test it in 1 minute.\n. Sorry, but, I'm not explaining well my problem and/or you are not undersating me.\nI try it again:\n1. I have a PuTTY console, named it X, attached into a ConEmu tab.\n2. And  I have another a PuTTY console, named it Y, attached into a ConEmu tab.\n3. I type some characters into X and then:\n* Those characters are not echoed, are not showed into the screen of X. X is \"frozen\", is not responding.\n* Those characters are showed into the screen of Y.\nWhat I typed in X is showed in Y, and X is not capturing that typing!\n4. Then, I go to Y, typing into it, and go back to X, and typing into X, and..., now X works!\nAre you understanding now?\n. Ok, Maximus5, I reply to you tomorrow.\n. Today is a new day. Come on to try it again.\nTabs are created after performing the \"Attach to...\" (\"Win+G\" shortcut) action. See this image:\n\nOf course, previously I have executed the \"putty.exe\" process.\nThe exact order is the following:\n1. Execute ConEmu.\n2. Execute a PuTTY process, X.\n3. Attach X to ConEmu. A new tab is created on ConEmu.\n4. Execute a PuTTY process, Y.\n3. Attach Y to ConEmu. A new tab is created on ConEmu.\nThe screenshots are here:\n\n\n\nThe logs are here:\nConEmu.zip\nI started ConEmu, at 09:36 hour in my timezone, with the \"-log4\" flag: \"c:...\\ConEmu\\ConEmu64.exe -log4\".\nLog files where generated at \"c:...\\ConEmu\\Logs\".\n. My procedure has an explanation:\nIn WinSCP (https://winscp.net) I have configured a lot remote host connections (all with password saved).\nFirstly I open WinSCP, select one of those connections, open it, and, finally select the \"Open session in PuTTY\" option, which opens a \"putty.exe\" process.\nAgain, I explain the keypoint of problem:\n1. Type in one console. Yes, it works.\n2. Go to another console and type in. Yes, it works.\n3. Go to the first one console and type in. DOES NOT WORKS: characters\ndoes not appears in screen, but, surprisingly, appears in the other one console!\nReally, make a practice test with PuTTY and some SSH connections, and you'll verify it.\nI can't send you more information.\n. I have repeat all steps and the problem persists: when I type \"fffffffffff\" on \"jwk2\" tab, nothing appears,\n\nbut all those \"f\"'s are captured and showed into \"jwk1\" tab:\n\n. Definetively, is an issue with ChildGui application (PuTTY) an ConEmu.\nI have read this:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html \n\n...\nif you run ChildGui application (PuTTY, mintty, and so on) ConEmu does not control their\nbehavior, and does not process their keyboard or mouse input. Use of \u2018native\u2019 console\nanalogues is preferable.\n...\n\nAnd this one:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/en/ConsoleApplication.html\n\n...\nFew examples: cmd.exe, powershell.exe, sh.exe, ...\n...\n\nAnd I tested the following:\n1. In ConEmu, click on \"New console...\"; a \"cmd\" tab is created.\n2. In that console, execute \"ssh myuser@mymachine1\" and login into that machine.\n3. In ConEmu, click on \"New console...\"; a \"cmd\" tab is created.\n4. In that console, execute \"ssh myuser@mymachine2\" and login into that machine.\n5. \"Play\" with typing, tab switching, etc. and now all is ok.\n. ",

    "timkraut": "@Maximus5 I don't feel like this is a Vim bug. It works fine without any problems at all using Git Bash. \n. Thanks for pointing to this explanation!\nI've executed c:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-cmd.exe --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i which reproduced the problem. Actually, Git Bash uses another executable (git-bash.exe) but this didn't change anything.\nJust to be sure that I understand the issue: Git Bash (and other tools) use the terminal mintty to execute console utilities (like vi(m)). As Windows and Unix OS' don't share the same architecture, these console utilities don't have the exact same code base for Windows and Unix. If there is a bug in one of them (like in vi(m)), it's possible that mintty contains some workaround so that this bug isn't experienced when using Git Bash (which uses mintty). As ConEmu doesn't pass its commands through another terminal (like mintty) but uses the console utilities directly, the workaround in mintty isn't applied and the user will experience the bug.\nIs that correct?\nThank you for your help! \nP.S.: Updating Git to 2.8.1 solved the issue\n. Ah. So mintty allows to run the Unix branch of the console utilities?\n. Awesome! Thank you very much, I've learned quite a lot!\n. ",

This currently works nicely in Linux, but not Windows (either standard Win 10 TH2 console or ConEmu).\n\nFor my diff project, I replaced ~~strikethrough~~ with underline, by using ESC[4;31m instead of ESC9;31m .\nThe original, under Linux and using ESC[9;31m looks like this:\n\nUsing the standard Windows 10 TH2 CMD.EXE console and  ESC[4;31m for underline produces:\n\nHowever, under ConEmu using the same  ESC[4;31m sequence produces non-underlined red text with a white grey background using under most of ConEmu's color schemes.\n\nShould I open a separate issue for this?\n.

When I resize my VM window, the screen resolution changes, and the ConEmu window itself is resized. Often I do this accidentally and then restore the VM window to its original setting. \nEven after this accidental VM display resize is done, the child frames never get the message that the window's parent display has changed resolutions (or in this case, the resolution has changed back), and the child frame thinks when the ConEmu window is maximized, that the old, smaller resolution is what it needs to be resized to.\nI have found that it often can be made to work properly again by \n\nTurning off both \"Align ConEmu window size to cells\" and \"Snap to desktop edges\"\nSetting the ConEmu window to be non-maximized\nResizing the window manually to a slightly larger size by dragging the lower-right corner\nTHEN you can maximize and it then resizes the child frame properly\n\nIt even continues working after turning back on the two settings mentioned in the first step until the resolution of the display changes again.\nHope that helps.

Since its working with linux.\nplease find the same ssh connection from mintty embedded in conemu using 'C:\\Programs.babun\\cygwin\\bin\\mintty.exe /bin/env CHERE_INVOKING=1 /bin/zsh'\n\nWhile using mintty its working.

    "lexa2": "ConEmu 160707 + Cywin64 + conemu-cywin-connector 0.7.4 here on the client side and EL6 on the server side.\nCreated a text file just like you did on the screenshot and spend about 4 minutes jumping in file using PgUp/PgDn/Up/Down/Home/End. Hadn't been able to reproduce the issue.\nThe fact that you have the issue with remote connection and do not have one with local connection suggests that you should check the contents of your TERM environment variable. It is \"xterm-256color\" for me both locally and remotely.\nI do have other issues with ConEmu + cygwin + connector (described here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/conemu_ml/HBTLBzdSUBw) but they do differ from the issue you had reported here.\nHaving differences in behavior between remote linux and solaris shells also indicates that they are most probably related to the differences in terminfo/termcap databases between your linux and solaris installs. \n. If I were you I would try to fetch termcap and terminfo defs for your TERM from linux server and compile a new test terminal defs on solaris server using them. Read man on tic and infocmp for gory details.\nYour best friends would be \"infocmp -I\", \"infocmp -C -r\" on the linux side and \"mkdir -p ~/.terminfo; tic -o ~/.terminfo/ \" on solaris side. Also you would have to change terminal name on solaris side to something sane like \"xterm-256color-testing\" in the dump file and then execute TERM=\"xterm-256color-testing\" zsh after you had compiled new terminfo definition. In the unlikely case that your term/app use legacy termcap database you should also populate TERMCAP environment variable either with the termcap definition for the terminal (data you get from infocmp -C -r) or put that data into a file and provide full path (i.e. it should start with a \"/\" character) in the TERMCAP envvar.\nI really suspect that the bug you hit is due to some differences between terminfo databases in solaris and linux and it would benefit us all in case you would be able to pinpoint this difference. Comparing linux vs. solaris definitions for your TERM using infocmp would be of a great help here.\n. @fpqc While your feature request is perfectly possible to implement I'd doubt that Maximus5 would ever bother to do so: it is a pretty specific functionality that looks more like a hack rather than something else.\nAs you know X-Server architecture assumes that it would open up arbitrary windows from the client processes that connect to it and these windows are not limited to urxvt - they could easily be something that comes from a remote GUI app you had started up over ssh while using XForwarding. Even if you would launch xserver as a ConEmu child process there would be no sane way to distinguish between (u)rxvt windows and any other app windows you might encounter.\nOn the other hand you could possibly automate this using AutoIt or some other similar software. You would have to implement a script that would look for windows spawned by xserver process and having something related to rxvt in their title and then perform a macro that would attach found window as a ChildGUI app into your ConEmu session.\nI don't know if there is an API of some sort in ConEmu that allows to easily automate \"Attach...\" operation. If not - then that is a valid feature request IMO for ConEmu to provide such an API for third party use. It could be a command line utility of some sort or a reaction to a custom windows message sent to ConEmu using SendMessage/PostMessage windows API. In reality details are not so important and should be defined by the implementing person.\n. @fpqc Ough, and forgot to mention that XMing is an old (and a bit commercial) thing and there are more recent alternatives that could suit you better, like this: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/\n. @Maximus5 \nIssue poster actually requests you to implement ZModem protocol in ConEmu. Don't know if you were around back in early-to-mid nineties when there were no internet and people were using modems to dial into BBS and upload/download some files. It is typical for terminal emulator (which ConEmu actually is) to support legacy transport protocols like X/Y/ZModem or Kermit. ZModem is best of them all as it supports transfer auto-startup, multiple files transfer in one session, automatic file name transfer, download resuming after crash and some more nice features.\nPersonally I don't see a real reason to use ZModem nowdays when we use reliable transports like TCP streams instead of serial links and there are a lot of other well established file transfer protocols (ftp, sftp, scp, rsync and many more). Also implementing ZModem in ConEmu would be a painful task to deal with as windows console concept is totally different to stdin/stdout concept used by serial links (and ZModem). \nTL/DR: I don't think this feature request is worth spending development efforts on. Using ssh for remote server access and sz for file transfer over ssh IMO is a rare usage pattern which contradicts with the modern ways of doing the same things (though I see one reason for this - simplicity, type in \"sz myfile\" and there you go). \n. Small followup: the only place where it would be easier to fit ZModem w.r.t. ConEmu is a cygwin connector. Still don't think this would be a good idea as it would unnecessarily complicate connector without much practical benefit.\n. @chadi-kazan Not enough details in your bug report to be useful. Provided screenshot lacks important info like ConEmu status bar contents. I doubt that the output on the screenshot comes from \"cmd.exe\". My bet is that it is an application you execute from cmd.exe command prompt. Had you tried to launch this application under plain windows console host (most people know it as \"cmd.exe\" or \"Command Prompt\")? Does the output differ compared to what you get under ConEmu? Is your application in question cygwin-based or not?\n. @Maximus5 Original poster mentions cygwin which means that git he uses most probably is a cygwin application of some sort (or msys which is essentially the same for this case). So to the very least OP would have to use cygwin-connector to get ANSI escape sequences to reach ConEmu at all. \nGit for Windows which is mentioned as a working example of the new functionality most probably uses bash/mintty (at least it was like that with older Git for Windows releases) so terminal emulation and presentation is handled by mintty (and not conhost!). So it is not a surprise that italic and strikeout work there.\n. ",
    "mrkishi": "It's not a normal use-case, of course. It happens accidentally, mostly when using alternative shells. I agree, it doesn't make sense to run a task by default-- I just thought I might have missed some macro, script or setting for the restore.\nThanks, though!\n. @Maximus5 I didn't. The difference is that the Minimize/Restore (Quake-style hotkey also) does not bring to front if the window is out of focus. Instead, it minimizes the window.\n. Okay, I figured out the Minimize/Restore hotkey works differently if Always on top is turned on or off.\nWhen it's off, Minimize/Restore works like what I proposed. When it's on, Minimize/Restore doesn't focus on the window.\nThis is either a feature or a bug. If it's a feature, the proposed new hotkey is still needed for users of Always on top. If it's a bug, there's no need for a new hotkey, but the Minimize/Restore behavior could be fixed to be consistent regardless of the Always on top setting.\n. As I said before: yes, they do bring it to the front, as long as always on top is disabled.\nWhy do you not suggest me to enable Always on top? If it's not intended to be used, it shouldn't be an option.\nHere, I use ctrl-\u00e7 as Minimize/Restore:\n\nAfter using whatever I need from the always-on-top ConEmu window, pressing Minimize/restore hides it instead of bringing focus back. If that's intended for always on top windows, I stand by the original feature request.\n. Also, I'm willing to help implement this if pointed in the right direction. I'm unfamiliar with ConEmu's codebase, so I'd rather have some idea of where to look. I assume it's not a difficult modification given all it needs to do is already implemented in the other hotkeys.\n. Just saw you fixed this on the latest release. Thank you! :+1: \n. ",

Not sure if this is the best solution, but I wrote a function to change the paths.  You can put this in your .bashrc\nfunction linuxpath()\n{\n  echo $1 | sed 's_([A-Za-z]):/mnt/\\L\\1_g' | sed 's_/_g'\n}\nThen, on the linux side, you could call $(linuxpath C:\\Windows\\path\\here\\to\\things) to get the corresponding /mnt/c/ style path.\nAnother option would be to switch to the directory you want first and the call bash.exe\n.

    "holybreath": "I guess it's a release package downloaded from the official VIM site months ago.\n\n. Hi, I tried :set noshowcmd, though the ^[ disappear, the lag is still there, that means every time I click Esc or ctrl+[, it don't go to normal mode instantly, but about one second later.\nBut now I think it maybe a too trivial issue to occupy your time, since a lot of people would like use gvim on windows.

    "farzadmf": "As a heavy user of the Guake Terminal on Linux (which I believe is the most popular terminal with quake style option), I think pressing the shortcut key should hide the window if it's open (no matter if has focus or not), and display it if it's hidden.\nThis is the behavior you see in Guake: if it doesn't have focus and it's visible, you press the key twice, hiding and re-opening the window with focus.\nMaybe the best solution is to add an option so that we can choose whether we want the Guake-style functionality (always show/hide regardless of the focus) or the bring-to-front functionality - or maybe we can have different shortcuts for the two things:\n- One shortcut to show/hide (ignoring focus) - just like Guake\n- One shortcut to bring to front\n. Any news on this issue? The funny things is that I was looking at the keyboard shortcuts and I saw that there are two settings:\n- Restore/Minimize\n- Restore (bring to front)\nAnd right now, there is NO difference between the two! So why not just make them do what they say: Restore/Minimize only restores and minimizes, and the other one brings the window to the front (like @mrkishi wanted)\n. I wish we had seen an \"official\" reply here from the maintainer(s) of the repository. The only workaround that I found for this \"non-standard\" issue is to enable \"auto-hide on focus lose\". So, if I understand correctly, this was a feature being requested, but to be honest, I don't think it makes sense; I'm using Gauke on Linux everyday at work, and the way it works, if you press F12 and Guake is open, it disappears and vice versa: so if you intend to bring to the front, you press the key twice.\nAt least for me, it makes much more sense if the behavior is like that; after all, the mode is Quake style and Guake is one of the most popular terminals with this style in Linux\n. I'm not sure how I can provide screenshots of my two monitors, but I generated the log files with this scenario:\n1. I do Win + R and run conemu.exe -log\n2. I'm in my primary monitor; I press the shortcut key (I have it set to Ctrl+Shift+~ and the alternative one to F9) and I can display/hide ConEmu\n3. I hide ConEmu and I move my mouse to my second monitor\n4. I press F9 (or Ctrl+Shift+~) and ConEmu appears on my primary monitor\n5. I can type into ConEmu, but when I press either of my shortcuts, it has no effect and ConEmu stays there (my mouse being on my second monitor)\n6. I move my mouse cursor to my primary monitor and now the shortcut would affect ConEmu (show/hide)\nAnd my logs:\nConEmuLogs.zip\n. I checked with the latest version, and I'm not able to re-produce the issue, so I guess I can close it :). Hello @Maximus5 \nJust a thought: maybe it wouldn't be possible to do something for pressing ENTER, but is it possibly by any chance provide functionality like VSCode's integrated terminal, where you can press CTRL + K to clear the console at any time.\nWhat is does is that if an app is running, it clears the whole console, and if not, it clears the console and display your prompt. \nWhat do you think about that?. What I meant is to have a shortcut to clear the console while an application is running and printing to the console\n(maybe there's already something that I'm not aware of). Thank you so much @Maximus5 ; the reset feature for me personally is very useful. Thank you @Maximus5 for answering, but it didn't change anything for me:\n\nThe thing is that I have actually changed some colors, and that's the reason I asked this question in the first place. With my color customization like this:\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nAnd I was thinking maybe I have configured improperly; that's why I tried with a provided color customization, but it has the same result, only with different colors.\nAnd also, when it's like this, and I configure Vim to use 256 colors as suggested in the documentation, when I start Vim, the whole console is filled with a color other than the background.. I'm not actually cropping the screenshot. I thought it would be more helpful if I took a screenshot that only contains the \"important\" part\nMy Perl version is actually the version coming with Git for Windows, and it seems it's version v5.26.2.\nThis is actually a screenshot when I open Vim in ConEmu (with the settings mentioned above):\n\nAnd my vimrc contains the following lines as suggested by the documentation:\n```\nset background=dark\nif !has(\"gui_running\")\n    set term=xterm\n    set t_Co=256\n    set mouse=a\n    set nocompatible\n    let &t_AB=\"\\e[48;5;%dm\"\n    let &t_AF=\"\\e[38;5;%dm\"\n    colorscheme solarized\nendif\n```\nAnd the solarized color scheme comes from vim-colors-solarized. Thank you @Maximus5 for your answer. Can you also give some guidance for the VIM issue that I have? \nI'm trying to make my Vim in command line look like the solarized dark from vim-colors-solarized, but it doesn't work (I attached a screenshot in my previous comment)\n\nI really appreciate if you help me because it's been a long-time issue for me that I could never solve (and actually the 256colors test was just to make sure that the colors are working fine and my main concern was the colors in Vim.)\nPS: I'm using PowerShell as my shell. Does it change anything? Do I need to use another shell to make sure my Vim colors are working properly?. Thank you @Maximus5 for your answer, I'm using PowerShell, and I tried to put the prompt function inside my profile, and it seems to be working.\nThere's just one problem. I'm using PoshGit module in PS, which is responsible for changing the prompt when inside a git directory, but with the suggested prompt function, it's overriding that prompt. Is there a way to use the function just to inform ConEmu about that path, but display existing prompt?\nBTW, I'm closing this issue because the original question was answered, and this seems to be an edge case in my case.\nThank you again. Thanks, I'll try to investigate :). @Maximus5  I started investigating and a question came to my mind:\nWhat does ConEmu actually need to be returned from function prompt? Does it have to be only the path of CD or it can be any string, which also contains the CD path, and ConEmu will figure out the CD path from that?. @Maximus5 I created this PR to the documentation repo. So, does it mean that I cannot change it to use my own shortcut?. Thank you @m0n , great idea! AutoHotKey wasn't in my mind at all :). Thank you @Maximus5 , I didn't know about them. I'll need to go through the docs to see how to do it. Hi @Maximus5 , so I tried to set up a shortcut and use a GUI Macro:\n\nBut, when I press my shortcut key, I see the tab being changed in ConEmu, but for some reason, the focus isn't changed to that (I mean I only see the change in the tab bar). Thank you @m0n , that does the trick :)\nClosing this as using GUI Macros resolves my issue. ",

    "eromoe": "Sorry, I think ConEmu support all encoding by default...\nI have tried the three way, none work ....\nIt only make the word looks more ugly(first two way):\n\nthe 3rd way act nothing different from before.\n\n.

Is there an universal font for every character ? \n. I have updated to the newest version, default config(env chcp utf-8)\nNow I am at home, win7 act as same on win 8.1, maybe due to my system is Chinese??\n\n. \n. It seems cause by this Console font info: 0, {9x18}, 54, 700, \"\u65b0\u5b8b\u4f53\", it is not Consolas, but settings shows it is using Consolas...\n. Thanks,  it looks good now :)\n. You are right, I didn't consider multi \"ConEmu here\" use case before. So, why not provide a droplist/dropdown menu point to user define task(a tasks mappings list)?  I cost some time from googling to figure out use /single /cmd {Git Bash} -cur_console:n  to register ConEmu here(git-bash). Many people wouldn't know this. Embed that mappings would be much more convenient and user friendly.\nAbout ctrl+shift+e and ctrl +shift +o, the shortcuts to open a new splited pane. If current pane is {cmd}, the shortcut open {cmd},  if current is {git-bash}, it open {git-bash}. I menthon that because I like a global default settings.. > {cmd} to any desired task. Anyway, docs page explain details.\ndocs page doesn't says I can use {Git Bash}  directlly with an example, that's one unclear point.\nWhat I suggest is change below Command: input\n\nto a dropdown menu (corresponding to tasks defined in Startup->Tasks ):\n\nI don't think one would register a context menu not in the tasks.(In contrast word, user usaully register context menu by predifined tasks)\n\nSo what? You described the current behavior.\n\nThat just a response to your previous saying Unclear. In main article I think the all new create window/ pane or something else, need a default global setting. I still think a global setting is useful, because not so many people like to add a lot context menu. Different shell has different behavious, so I always use only one of them, I think many normal user like this too.\n. \nWin+works fine, on my home win10 too. This tip show everytime when I open ConEmu , just a little annoying. . Sorry,  I don't realizeRecreate active consoleis ahotkey. That sentence seems saying \"detect hotkey conflict, so Recreate an active console\" .Because Win + works well , \nmake me think ConEmu is warning that  Win +is conflict with some windows default hotkey.... @Maximus5  Just default settings,  I also tried to add chcp utf-8 in ConEmu or set CJK font toMS Gothic`, both not work.. \nwin 10 showing like this with default settings thought it can print the characters.... Such themes work well on linux terminal, so I ask question here. I am really not familiar with fonts and gui word showing. . Oh, sorry... I always solve movie sub looking problem by installing some fonts without config anything in video player, wihch spoil me feeling just install font would work. Actually thinking a little would understand that font must be writen in the sub files. This question is really silly , sorry for that.. @Maximus5 \ngit-bash itself is working:\n\nOnly wrong while using ConEmu{Git bash}:\n\nSo I think the problem is the real consol font, but I can't find a proper way to set it.. In addition, I changed git-bash font settings before I did above test,  maybe related to the problem\n\nPS: no matter what config I changed, ConEmu rendered wrong font\n. I have read the link serveral times, thanks for you effort, but I still can't understand the key point you said.\n\n\nThird-party software problems\n\nSame with ConEmu. It\u2019s a terminal, it just shows output of spawned console applications. Obviously, if third-party console application produces broken output, ConEmu can\u2019t magically make this output valid.\n\nThis time, I directly open mintty.exe under git-bash folder and test, the output is correct:\n\nThis make me feel git bash(mintty.exe) output is correct.  (PS: My windows path only include D:\\Git\\usr\\bin , so ConEmu would not call other mintty.exe)\nIf this way can't prove git-bash(mintty.exe) output is correct, please tell me what is the right way. Because I think I do according to the docs,  though by your saying  seems I didn't do the right thing?  I just can't figure out what is wrong, that is the problem. I think maybe that docs should be more detailly to describe this.\n\n\nCheck third-party software stand-alone\nThe whole section is talking about running tool or application.I am not running any tool or application in ConEmu , I am asking the font rendering problem, so skip this.\n\n\nDo not run your console tool in mintty\nThe whole section is talking about running tool or application.I am not running any tool or application in ConEmu , I am asking the font rendering problem, so skip this.\n\n\nRun your shell without profile\nDo not point out how to run git-bash(mintty.exe) without profile\n```\n\nConEmu -run git-bash -noprofile \nConEmu -run mintty -noprofile \n```\nBoth not work\n\n\n\nNote about DefaultTerminal\nnot enable. \n\n",

When you shrink the panel, letters are being compressed too forcefully and in the end you have to enable monowidth to be able to distinguish characters\n. here you go:\nConEmu 160612 [32] Startup Info\n  OsVer: 6.1.7601.x64, Product: 1, SP: 1.0, Suite: 0x100, SM_SERVERR2: 0\n  CSDVersion: Service Pack 1, ReactOS: 0 (), Rsrv: 0\n  DBCS: 0, WINE: 0, PE: 0, Remote: 1, ACP: 1251, OEMCP: 866, Admin: 0\n  AppID: 41ff8172ae65e0896451e011f983072f::161\n  Desktop: Winsta0\\Default, SessionId: 1, ConsoleSessionId: 4\n  Title: D:\\Shell\\Far\\ConEmu.exe\n  Size: {0,0},{0,0}\n  Flags: 0x00000001, ShowWindow: 1, ConHWnd: 0x00000000\n  char: 1, short: 2, int: 4, long: 4, u64: 8\n  Handles: 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000\n  Current PID: 15364, TID: 26648\n  Active HKL: 0x04090409\n  GetKeyboardLayoutList: 0x04090409 0x04190419\n.

That's why I wrote that expected behavior from updating the program is to not lose current functionality\n. OK, did it\nCHCP:\n\nHow it looks in plain Far:\n\nConEmu (2016):\n\nAnd this specific long string I mentioned before:\n\nRealconsole (cursor on long filename):\n\n. Oh well ok, will stick to old version then.\nEven if Far team admits and fixes it, that will leave me with VERY ugly view with a lot of spaces when I'd run Far without ConEmu (I don't always run it, only when I need to work with japanese files and see their names)\nThanks for help\n. Elaborate please, what exactly do you mead by cropped content?\nIf it's about my choice to stick with old version - that's because in new version I get garbled and unreadable 'content' which is no content at all. Old version has it's disadvantages (mainly cutoff on the right in dialog boxes for very long strings) but at least my files are shown correctly and I see nice charmy words, like if I'd copied them in word. With new version I'd have to try hard to read any of long filenames, or if I used monowidth, I'd have a ugly spaced ascii. IMO, old version totally wins this comparison\nJust to note, I don't need and don't use any of ConEmu's fancy features except main ability to show unicode filenames - without switching locale, mucking with system fonts and et cetera. I'd use Total Commander, as it does this even better, but it sucks when working with command line\n. To prove my point, single screenshot that demonstrates\n\n1) how text would be cropped if FAR used 2 cells for DBCS chars.\nUpper filename is 31 dbcs chars long (to count, I used 60-digit file). This is how FAR would print it if the 'bug' was fixed.\nLower filename - 62 dbcs chars. It goes beyond end of tab.\nNow, tell me, which line of information should be tagged as 'cropped'? Especially consider that for 31-char line, you don't even know that it is cropped. Filename may be actually 60 characters long but FAR would print only 31 of them (one per 2 cell, right?), and ConEmu would nicely fits each of those 31 characters to the left (unless you enable monowidth which looks ugly)\n2) How file information is not overlayed by text in my case. I see all size/date tabs correctly. Must be some different font settings in your case, or maybe different version of conemu? I couldn't replicate same behavior in my installation.\n//edit\n\nLets take WinWord for example\n\nBad comparison. WinWord crops not by number of characters, by but line glyph width (cm/pixels). That's exactly how old conemu works, and actually you're rooting for my team here\n. > You are wrong. If the bug would be fixed in Far, it would print the following\nErm. Then you probably lost me. I'll try to explain how I think, and you please correct me where I am wrong\n1. Didn't you say that proper width for DBCS characters is 2 cells? You meant character placeholders, like 80x25 in oldschool default console size, or is it something else?\n2. If so, any proper console program should print one DBCS character per 2 cells\n3. If so, it can fit width/2 characters for any given range of cells on virtual console screen. And there will be spaces, like when I enable monowidth in ConEmu\n4. If so, FAR would do the same. Not that characters would be really shown as FAR seems to be missing required fonts on non-japanese versions of windows. Instead, it shows square placeholders.\n5. Now see my previous screenshot and note right part of it with Real Console output. FAR fits all characters it can fit, showing them as squares. IF it was DBCS-aware, it would print one characters per 2 cells, effectively shortening shown filename length to half of tab width\n6. Now, if FAR would print 30 characters of long filename, ConEmu won't go out of it way to find a file, get it's name, and expand it to end of tab, right? ConEmu would just 'convert' existing strings to proper unicode glyphs, using whatever font is specified in settings. in process, shrinking whole line of text as lot of glyphs are less than 2 cells wide\n7. Then you'll get a situation like in my screenshot - where 30 characters are printed aligned to left, and a lot of space because FAR provided only those 30 chars and nothing more\nActually, this little screenshot shows how it prints DBCS chars on native jap windows, so I believe I made no mistakes in my logical chain\n\nThere's 2 numbers per each japanese character, so 'fixed' FAR on jap system would show half as much of these characters as it shows now, limiting string length to 30 chars. And if I wouldn't use monowidth font in ConEmu, all glyphs would get packed tightly to the left, leaving unused space to the end of tab (unless I use monolength font, which probably would look very ugly with non-japanese filenames)\n//edit\nAfter few more tests, I can't definitely say how current FAR works on native DBSC locales. Without ConEmu, it mostly shows 1 char per 2 cells, but sometimes it starts clamping them together in every cell...\nI won't post this bug to FAR forum because I have no guarantee that fixed FAR would work like it works now on non-DBCS Windows. That's how I use it now and I'm pretty happy with my experience. Japanese characters are shown correctly without using Total Commander, and without changing whole system locale. Upgrading to latest ConEmu version was just a experiment to see what was fixed and improved. Unfortunately, it didn't improve anything for me so I am staying on old version. Probably forever\n. I'm not into programming, much more in CPP.\nI'd like to hear specific answers - if FAR was fixed and DBCS-aware, how many characters would be shown in 60-cell wide tab in DBCS, and non-DBCS windows. And how would they look mixed with ascii characters? And how many characters would be seen in ConEmu window? And consider it all with non-monowidth font...\nAnd then compare with how many characters I see now in old ConEmu- it could be defined by phrase 'however many glyphs fit into tab space'\n\nSo, you are wrong here. There would be no spaces. Only CJK glyphs which are (unfortunately) doubled in conhost internal buffer (taking two cells) but are displayed as one wide glyph.\n\nWell, I mean spaces between glyphs. Console should use monowidth font for those, so there should be more spacing between actual character lines when compared to pure graphic output\n. yep.\n\u041f\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043c \u044e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f.\n\u041f\u043e\u0434 monowidth \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0443 - \u043a\u0430\u043a courier \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043b\u0438\u0444 \u0447\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b. \u0412 DBCS \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u044f\u0447\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438, \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 1- \u0438\u043b\u0438 2- \u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0412 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431 \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442-\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043d, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d \u0432\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432.\n. > Arial? Times New Roman? Tahoma? Awful... regardless CJK or not.\nAnd here's the answer. It would definitely look awful for me if this bug in FAR was fixed. That's why I won't report it and prefer you'd not do it too.\nI can live with older ConEmu version, but new versions of FAR are a must, they fix and add a lot of things. If at some point they'd 'fix' it, I'd either have much shorter CJK strings (compared to before), or would stick with outdated FAR version.\nSo just forget all this issue please. Anyway, I may be forced to switch to linux in 5 years...\n. Thanks for an option!  Only now I noticed it and at last updated my conemu version\nThere's still some minor difference in character output from old version though - for some fonts, characters are not centered in their cell, like there's very little space on left and a lot on right. Since Monowidth doesnt do anything for them, I assume it has to do something with font itself\n(happens with 'MS UI Gothic' but not 'MS Gothic').\nIt's not something that really needs fixing since I'm alright with changing font, but who knows, maybe it can be fixed with a single line of code...\nThis is how text looks in old version of conemu (size 20 MS UI Gothic, cell 0, I was using it since I found the combination):\nThis is new version, same settings (I copied conemu.xml and disabled 'compress long strings' option):\n\n\u30ea character is obviously moved a little to the left, it is clearly seen if I edit filename and select this character to see where it's glyph ends\nThis is the same string with cell=12:\n\nReadable but not very pretty : ) could be mistaken for space character\nSo I tried other fonts and surprisingly it displays correctly with MS Gothic:\n\nI noticed it seems to be happening only to fonts which aren't monowidth.\nHere we have MS Gothic japanese characters aligned as 2 ascii cells:\n and selection to show actual placeholder:\nAnd here;s MS UI Gothic: \n and selection:\nThat just feels like an error somewhere in text handling code, so I am going to close this issue (since everything else works as intended) and if you want you can look into this further at your own pace\n. Well, if you have the time to fix it :) I can live with current situation though\nExamples of broken text (all with font MS UI Gothic, size=20, width=0, cell=0, all checkboxes are unchecked): \n\u6deb\u884c  - complex kanji often overlap, I'll give one example but almost all of them have wrong width:\n\nEasier to see it if you select one character in text, selection immediately crops that character\nSpace is too thin (and is not affected when I enable monospace and cell=12):\ncell=0, monospace disabled: \nThis is with cell=12:\nString is the same as in first example, I just quickly typed space between characters to make screenshots\n\u30ea  - \nFrom what I can find, same problem (too little space on left and too much on right) with \u30c3, \u30af , \u30bf, \u30a4, \u30c9, \u3057\nNo problem with \u30e0, \u30fc, \u3044, \u3093, \u30b9, chars. Maybe they're too wide to have this problem or it somehow depends on unicode number\nCJK exclamation mark \uff01(U+ff01): \nThough even in my current browser it isn't centered in it's placeholder. Sadly, no, I just use old version of conemu, from 2014. I don't use newer features, all I need is correct display of unicode characters and it does it.\nThe exact version is 141221 [32bit]. >There is no sense in using old builds\nI respectfully disagree with that.\nThis is from old version of conemu, pure cmd output:\n\nAnd this is from latest version:\n\n\"Compress long strings to fit space\" is irrelevant since strings in my output aren't that long to be affected by it\n.

    "dirkesquire": "Hello, many thanks for working on a patch.\nI subsequently, did an update to 160619, but it still doesn't appear to be working. Is the fix included in this release?\n. Thank you for working on this.\nI don't doubt that you fixed something, and but there is still some problem lurking. \nI noticed it did work correctly one time only since I installed the update, but after that not (hence my clarification 10 days ago). I've given it two weeks, and restarted a few times in the hopes it would miraculously start working again, but currently if I paste \"C:\\Files\\Username\\Directory\" into the prompt (either with right click or Ctrl-V) I still get this:\n$ cd C:\\Files\\Username\\Directory\nbash: cd: C:FilesUsernameDirectory: No such file or directory\nIt used to be that it would immediately escape the path into a linux compatible path on paste.\n\n. OK yes I have read your commit message thank you. But since I am no expert in your software I don't fully understand how multi/single line paste works or why I would need to, but I believe I have figured out a bit more how it works now. The problem is confirmed to be not with single-line mode but with multi-line mode. \nI have managed to figure out that:\na) When I right-click to paste it uses Multi-Line mode (even if I am pasting a single line with no line breaks), and this hasn't been fixed yet because (based off your commit message) your fix is only for single line mode.\nb) If in the Paste settings 'Multi-Line' is selected for Ctrl+V then this takes precedence even if I am only pasting a single line (i.e.  no line breaks). This explains the problem I was having. \nd) If I set Ctrl-V to 'single-line' mode then it works. But if I set Ctrl-V to 'multi-line' mode it does not.\nTo be honest I've always found the Paste settings a bit odd. The reason I like to have multi-line on is because I often paste python scripts into ConEmu so I find it useful. My most common use case is 1) CD to a directory, 2) Run python shell, 3) Be able to paste a multiple line scripts code.\nI can understand you might not want to escape paths if a user is pasting more than one line (because it could be confusing). But perhaps we can detect if the user is infact pasting multiple lines rather than having an either/OR approach dictated by a setting. Perhaps an 'automatic' mode for Ctrl-V? \n. Yes you can. Well Maximus isn't the most patient explainer out there, but I figured out from his responses that you can turn it off by going into settings > Keys & Macro > Paste Mode > Do Nothing.\n. ",

Autoconverting of paths inserted from the clipboard makes my life quite difficult - need to paste them firstly into notepad, add quotes, then ConEmu does not autoconvert them into unix path. I'd like to have the separated shortcuts - e.g. Shift-Insert for unconverted paste and say App-Insert for converted paste. Or at least possibility to disable autoconvert paste feature.

I think @pkasting made a good point at Sep 11, 2017 - as soon as buffer is selected and user press 'paste', the click-timer has to be cancelled and paste immediately be performed. There is no sense to wait for the double-click or tripple-click.

For context, I think jgoz and I are both using prezto themes (I'm pretty sure he's using sorin's and I'm on paradox) that take advantage of zsh's right-hand prompt. The way I've seen it described, most themes that take advantage of a right-hand and left-prompt on the same line do math in a before block to calculate the needed padding.\nI've tried several prompts that only use the left-hand prompt or a \"static\" combined prompt (I'm making up terms here, pls forgive) and they don't appear to have this issue. The Sorin and Paradox themes use a \"dynamic\" combined prompt that I think is redrawing the entire line with new padding everytime it receives a character.\n\nSorin and Paradox are disagreeing on how big the line actually is, but neither are rendering spaces at the correct width.\nSorin:\n\nParadox:\n\nUsing zsh with prezto/yadr\nUsing Windows 10 x64 Build 14367.\n.

I also didn't answer the question. You can switch between prezto prompts by prompt THEME_NAME, so like I was typing 'prompt paradoxandprompt sorin` before those screenshots.\nI was also using the default install of the swkp/dotfiles repository which is targeted at Mac OS X, but works pretty well on Windows/Linux minus some symbols. \n. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1354608/space_rendering_160619.con\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1354608/space_rendering_160609.con\n\n.

When running ConEmu and only in this configuration there is a long char echo delay when SSHing to a Unix server or appliance using ConEmu.\nI believe the issue is likely do to how Parallels for MAC works. It is odd that a PowerShell session via ConEmu doesn't experience the same char echo delay.\nI was hoping there was a way to tell ConEmu to echo characters locally.   I did test setting PuTTy to echo characters locally to see if that would help the delay between ConEmu and PuTTy but it did not resolve the delay.\n. Well interesting discovery.  When the VM guest is ran in full screen mode rather than in 'Converged Mode'.  The char echo delay isn't present.  So this issue is caused by the Parallels software and not ConEmu.

    "fpqc": "@Maximus5 No, no. I'm talking about the associated windows in Xming (a windows X Server).  The WSL process is irrelevant.\nFor example, it's just like if I was running Xming and Cygwin, and I opened up Xterm in cygwin and it opened up an Xterm window in my local Xserver (Xming).  In ConEMU, the process is listed as being type \"GUI\" and the Image name is Xming.exe.\nI can manually attach and detach the windows from ConEMU.\nThis should be under other-childgui.\n. Xming is a server runs in the system tray as a persistent executable listening on localhost and creates windows when requested by applications (i.e. X clients) connect.  \nFor each application (X client) that looks for DISPLAY=# (where # is set in the Xming (or in general any X server), you get an Xming window open. However, there is only one Windows process (xming.exe) running at a time.\n. Ah, okay.  Yeah that's why I thought it might be hard to do, but I thought maybe it was something you had considered.\n. @lexa2 Yeah what I was hoping for was something in ConEMU that looks for windows that match a certain regexp automatically get attached into ConEMU.\nAnyway, for now it's moot because I'm using a really ugly combination of autohotkey, VcXsrv (thanks!), and Tilda until MS improves conhost enough that it can at least support all of the features of libvte (Gnome-Terminal, Tilda, and Guake).  I'm hoping that once MS improves Conhost, I can go back to using ConEMU in native console mode, which is far better than all of the X11-based ones, which are all somewhat annoying (for example, making URLs clickable from an X terminal requires you to make your link-clicker \"wstart : {browsername}\" with @xilun 's cbwin project, which works but is not as nice as just being able to run your terminals natively in Windows.\n. Yep, noticed this too! It completely disabled colors 8-16 and replaced them with bold.  \nMintty for example has options to display bold as bold text, bold as intense colors (8-16) or both.  \n\nArguably, the correct way to do things would be for @Maximus5 to submit a conemu terminfo file to Thomas Dickey, have it added to the official terminfo database, and have it match the internals of Conemu, then have the wslbridge set TERM=conemu.  . @Maximus5 \n\nAll fixed now, super excited!\nIt would make life a whole lot easier if you added the termcol/ANSI translation to each of the colors in the color setting dialogue, right now I had to do it by trial and error:\n\nAlso, one missing feature is setting ConEMU's cursor color/type.  This can be controlled by ANSI codes usually, but it doesn't seem like there's a way to set the default color or shape.\nAlso, it would be nice to see an explanation for why blue, yellow, and cyan have two numbers next to them, and also what popup and popup background do in ANSI mode.  Thanks again!. @mhofman you can pass wslbridge its own arguments after the --wsl flag.  \nSo if it's supported in wslbridge to launch a different distro, you can pass it its own arguments.  You should ask here: https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge. @mhofman eh, how does that whole thing work?  Why does -t get followed by --distro-guid, then --, then the shell and its arguments. @mhofman you can put the current_console part at the very end and then you don't need all those dashes.

Apologies, misunderstood.\nI am unable to find extracted files, nothing under c:\\windows\\temp\nHowever, I am able to find those extracted files from previous installs (160515)\n. Yes, if I am running choco manually from my account, your path is true. But when I left it to run under system account, there are no files/directories with those names in c:\\windows\\temp, which should be default tempdir for local system account.\nI've checked this with psexec run with and without -s flag.\nWith -s\nTEMP=C:\\Windows\\TEMP\nTMP=C:\\Windows\\TEMP\ufffd\n\ufffd\nwithout s\nTEMP=C:\\Users\\MARCIN~1.BOJ\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nTMP=C:\\Users\\MARCIN~1.BOJ\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\ufffd\n. Yes, it worked perfectly, and because your ConEmu is such great tool, i just replaced cmd with conemu on all our machines.\nRan the last test: run installer via psexec with and without system account. Without system account looks like it works perfectly. With system account it hangs.\nI think that you may be right about Temp, in last version chocolatey changed something with Temp folders.\nIn my own installers I started to use tests: if temp path exists \n.

Hi Maximus5\nI am afraid with new version we again have problem with all servers puppet agent fails, and ConEmu setup just cumulates with tme (after few hours we have 5-6 running instances).\nIs it possible to make packages with MSI instead of exec, which currently seems to have serious problems?\n.

My Windows Build Number is 14393.\n. > In the recent build it's fixed. Thanks!\nAre you sure that updating to the most recent build was what fixed it for you?\nI have the latest ConEmu build (160914) installed and I still have this problem.\n. > There is nothing to fix in ConEmu. Your problem is related to Win10 insider updates.\nI'm not sure if you are replying to me or not but my Windows 10 install is not part of the Windows Insider Program.\n. > Both KiTTY and PuTTY changes their process acl to avoid any external manipulations. So it's normal that non-elevated ProcessExplorer can't read KiTTY process information.\nI did not know that. It makes since that an SSH Client would do that for security.\n\nConEmu runs KiTTY absolutely the same way as, for example, Notepad. And you may easily view environment of Notepad started in ConEmu.\n\nI just tested this and you are correct that when starting notepad via ConEmu, the Environment of notepad can be viewed without a problem.\n\nAs I said before, ConEmu doesn't catch any of internet related functions, so all questions must be addressed either to KiTTY authors or your antivirus software if you use any.\n\nYes, I know ConEmu doesn't catch any internet related functions. I just thought something about how ConEmu started KiTTY was causing it's calls to the Windows Network APIs to fail somehow.\nAt the moment though, it would appear the proof of that is zero so I have no idea what is going on.\nI don't have any anti-virus software beyond the Windows Defender software built-in to Windows 10.\nAll I know for sure is that PuTTY works in ConEmu and KiTTY doesn't so something is not working correctly somewhere.\nUnless I can find any other evidence for ConEmu being the problem, I'll just assume for now that ConEmu is not the problem here.\n. > Kitty started to work for me as well. Install all the windows updates and update ConEmu. Then try again.\nI have checked, I have all the latest Windows Updates installed, the latest ConEmu version and the latest KiTTY version installed.\nI still have this issue.\n\nLook. I said more than a time, contact KiTTY authors! Only authors may answer questions about their product.\n\nOk, I have now done that via a post in the KiTTY forum.\n. You can read some info on ConEmuHk at https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuHk.html.\nIt appears the main point of it is to hook some Windows APIs which allow ConEmu to do things that otherwise can't be done and to deal with bugs in Windows.\nYou can disable ConEmuHk by going to the features section of ConEmu settings and unchecking \"Inject ConEmuHk\".\n. Are you sure the ConEmu Window is not just minimized?\nThe default behavior for Taskbar Icons in Windows 7 and Up for single window programs is this:\nIf the program is not running then clicking the Icon will run the program.\nIf the program is running, not in focus and/or minimized then clicking the icon will unminimize (if needed) and/or focus the program's Window.\nIf the program is running and is in focus then clicking the icon will minimize the program's Windows.\n.

Disable \u2018Default Terminal\u2019 feature if you use it. (OK)\n2. Press Win+R and run your console application. (OK: C:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-cmd.exe --no-cd --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i  )\n3. Ensure that your RealConsole has the same dimensions as in ConEmu. (OK, resized although probably not relevant in this case)\n4. Right-click on the RealConsole title and choose \u2018Properties\u2019. Ensure that Font is either \u2018Consolas\u2019 or \u2018Lucida Console\u2019. (OK)\n5. Ensure that console window buffer and window width and height are the same as in ConEmu (you may check them in StatusBar). (OK, although probably not relevant in this case)\n6. Try to reproduce your problem. In most cases it repeats, that definitely means that the problem is inside console application, but not in ConEmu. (did the ssh, accents work. The problem is not present in RealConsole)\nMaybe I'm missing something, but still these tests point towards something related to ConEmu.\nDo you think this could be solved with your connector?\nSmall addition to the previous comments: If after step 6 I open ConEmu and \"attach\" the previous console (in the working ssh session), accents stop working.\nThanks for your time and best regards,\n  Agust\u00edn.\n. Hi again.\nIf I do your steps only from the bash terminal, it works in all cases (in and out of ConEmu), the problem is when I enter an ssh session, so I followed your steps again, including the ssh part:\n1. In bash started in ConEmu show RealConsole and try to type accented characters in both windows.\n   accents stop working when in an ssh session in both windows (see attached screenshot where I typed \"agust\u00edn\" before the ssh, but could not get accents afterwards)\n\n2. Attach (Win-G) bash started outside of ConEmu. Type in ConEmu window. Is it working?\n   It worked before attaching, it stops working after attaching, see screenshot below:\n\n3. If there is a difference, please show screenshots of Settings/Info for both tabs.\n   There is no difference once they are inside ConEmu, they do not work. Here are the screenshots just in case:\nConEmu bash:\n\nAttached console:\n\nThanks again for your patience,\nAgust\u00edn.\n(I need to leave, will continue testing as needed tomorrow, thanks!!!!)\n. Hi again.\n1. Yes, I can tell in which window I'm typing by the blinking cursor/caret. I repeated it again just in case, it makes no difference whether I type in ConEmu or in the  RealConsole linked to it.\n2. Yes, if I show attached RealConsole (to any of ConEmu tabs under ssh) accents aren't working in any of the windows (ConEmu/RealConsole).\nAs for the versions (git-for-windows includes the ssh part also):\n```\n$ git --version\ngit version 2.10.0.windows.1\n$ ssh -V\nOpenSSH_7.3p1, OpenSSL 1.0.2h  3 May 2016\n```\n. ### I found the culprit\nIn order to make UTF-8 output work in my terminal (output from gradle for instance) I had switched my terminal into UTF-8 mode by putting this under ConEmu Environment:\nchcp utf-8\nAs it turns out, if I remove this line, accents work again while under ssh. But then removing it will also break my gradle terminal output which is utf-8... bummer.\n_Additional comments_\nFrom this I gather that what I put in ConEmu Environment gets executed even when I attach external consoles?\nAs a workaround for when I need chcp utf8 stuff, what would you recommend?\n$ set ConEmuCpCvt=gradlew:850:65001;\n?\nThanks again for your time!\n. > Thats why I mention same conditions of fair comparison. https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html#stand-alone\n\nI believe, if you execute \"chcp 65001\" in standalone prompt and execute ssh - you'll get the same problem without ConEmu. Than it's obviously an ssh bug.\n\nYou are completely right! My mistake was thinking that the environment stuff was not being executed when I attached an external console, so I didn't think much about it. Like you said, I'm not sure either if this is correct or not (unexpected for me, but I can live with it).\nThanks for your help figuring this out!\n\n\nworkaround for when I need chcp utf8\nYou found it. Is it working?\n\n\nUnfortunately it's not working. Tried both in the console before executing ./gradlew taskxxx\n$ set ConEmuCpCvt=java.exe:850:65001;\n$ ./gradlew taskxxx\n$ set ConEmuCpCvt=gradlew:850:65001;\n$ ./gradlew taskxxx\nOr is this setting for the ConEmu Environment part?\n. gradlew is the gradle wrapper (a sh script), and ultimately it runs java.\nI also tried your option (with the cps reversed from one of my tries) but it didn't work either.\nIf I run chcp (not in the path but it works if I give it its full path) I get 850.\nManually changing the cp with chcp works:\n$ /c/Windows/System32/chcp.com 65001\nP\u00e1gina de c\u00f3digos activa: 65001\nNow ./gradlew taskxx will show correct output but if I go to ssh, I can no longer enter accents.\nHowever I can revert the cp to 850 before doing ssh and they will work again.\nSomething I will need to remember to manually witch the cp back and forth, but for now I'll change my default back to 850 instead of utf8.\nIn the end it looks like it's either (or both):\n- a bug of ssh (git-bash-ssh) + utf8-codepage\n- a bug with gradle/java and 850-codepage \nThanks a lot for your time!\n. Anyway, definitely NOT a ConEmu bug.\nJust reproduced it with git-bash (outside ConEmu) by changing the codepage to 65001 and doing the ssh, accents do not work.\n@Maximus5 sorry to have bothered you with this and thank you for helping out!\nI'll open the bug report on the git-for-windows tracker! (see git-for-windows/git#902)\nThanks!\n. ",

    "karliss": "This project can be used to directly control console mode without messing with bash.exe.\n. It could be more difficult than that. Warning I am not too familiar with insides of ConEmu so I might be wrong. From what I understand ConEmu can obtain application output in two ways: stdout from proper console application, hook into windows console API calls like WriteConsole.\nIt seems that bash.exe is not a proper console application, it can be tested by running bash.exe -c ls > a1.txt. Doing that results in \"Error: 0x80070057\" being written to a1.txt. Using lxlaunch has similar results when trying to pass a handle to file instead of console screen buffer.  \nAs for second case I am guessing that writes are done in a different process not bash.exe/lxlaunch making it difficult for ConEmu to hook into WriteConsole calls.\nI was able to get some of the ANSI codes recognized by manually reading data from console screen buffer using ReadConsoleOutputCharacter and then printing it to stdout.\n\n. I agree that this is wrong.  For arbitrary program using Windows console API there is no way of knowing which parts of buffer were updated, and where. I did it mostly to confirm that ConEmu isn't processing ANSI codes because actual writes to console buffer are done somewhere else where hook can't observe it, instead of not having correct mode enabled. \nAt the moment I have SetConsoleMode(outHandle, DISABLE_NEWLINE_AUTO_RETURN). And I do reads from position 0;0, and reset cursor to 0;0 after each read. It worked better than I expected, probably because WLS is using mostly ANSI codes directly to change the position instead of Windows API.\n. Why couldn't flashing be enabled at the same time as sound? It would be useful for finding out which of the windows in background were making the noise and need attention.\n\n\nSetting\nResult\ncomment\n\n\nDisable flashingSuppress bells\nflashingsound \n\n \u2714 Why no flashing?\n\u2714 \u2714ok\n\u2714 \u2714ok\n\u2714\u2714 ok\n. It seems that the way unicode describes bidirectional text printing characters in correct order requires knowing full text (chunk of text) in advance. That is not really practical for terminal. Printing characters incrementally can change positions of previously printed characters. \nFrom the look of https://www.arabeyes.org/ArabeyesTodo#Terminal_Emulators no one really knows how bidirectional text should interact with various terminal control characters like moving/reading cursor position, clearing until end of line and others. What happens you replace character in the middle of previously printed text? . Turns out ECMA-48 standard has a little bit of information about how bi-directional text should interact with terminal control sequences. http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-048.pdf \nHaven't read it carefully so I can't comment if it's usable, implementable and how well it matches the bi-directional text logic that was added to unicode after it was written..

    "axefrog": "Ok, that was a slightly more patronizing response than I hoped for. May I suggest that when a query comes in, perhaps give the benefit of the doubt to the person enquiring, ask yourself if your proposed solution is possibly obvious enough that maybe they already tried it, and hold off on insta-closing the issue until you're sure that your assumptions are correct? Also, \"RTFM\" is a useful response when the manual is clear, well-structured, and the information being requested would have been found with a minor amount of effort. It is not a polite response when the information being requested is non-obvious, difficult to find and related to an interface that is quite complex and difficult to navigate.\nAnyway, I digress. I am never one to disparage someone else's freely-shared, open source efforts, and I know I have certainly benefited greatly from your software, so you have my gratitude for that. Your response to my enquiry makes me more inclined to just be blunt though, so here goes.\nFirst of all, yes, I did use the search feature before posting this issue. I searched for multiple different terms that seemed relevant, and on top of that I went through every property page multiple times and double checked every option I could see, including hovering over tooltips to see what they do. I also went to the website and searched for an answer using both the search box and by browsing through the different sections and reading the FAQ sections.\nProof of issue:\n\nSettings that do not resolve the issue:\n\nDocumentation does not provide clarification:\n\nNow that you can see that I'm not just being lazy and trying to waste your time, perhaps you could point me in the right direction?\nThanks.\n. If you'll re-read my question, you'll note I was asking for help. A polite response could have been to say something like \"It's in the settings on page X. You need to click Y. Not sure if you noticed, but there's a search bar that will find this fairly quickly too. Also, what version are you using? Newer versions have improved the settings in this area\"\nInstead, your response neglected to actually answer my question or acknowledge that I don't have your context or specific domain knowledge; instead you snarkily suggested I use the search feature but failed to actually offer any relevant help, and patronizingly offered a two-step guide to using the search bar, including with links to the site, implying that I should read the documentation, and that you certainly aren't interested in actually pointing me in the right direction.\nRegarding your second response:\n1) Ok great, that has no bearing on this. I was unaware that the version I was using was significantly out of date.\n2) Let me quote my original question:\n\nAt some point I was able to disable the title bar of the conemu window. It was a long time ago and I can't remember what option I changed, and despite having been through all of the settings pages multiple times, I can't find anything that will give me back the normal window title bar. Any pointers would be appreciated, and if I might make a suggestion... perhaps make it easier to find?\n\nNote the bolded text. What else should I have mentioned?\n3) Ok, well gee whiz, sorry about that. I didn't realise my version was so far out of date that the settings will have changed significantly enough to address this as an issue.\n. I've now updated, and as you can see, the options are the same.\n\n. I'm sorry, I should have read the template more thoroughly. I guess I skipped it because I wasn't reporting a bug, but rather just asking a question.

Running bash.exe directly (not through ConEmu), the cursor changes in insert mode:\nNormal Mode\n\nInsert Mode\n\n@Maximus5 Not sure if this fixes the root issue you mentioned before that prevents ConEmu from accessing the Real Console state. Any plans to look into this in light of this new fix?\n. I have created a workaround for this. Sticking this into your .vimrc will get your cursor to switch between block and beam for normal mode and insert mode respectively:\n```\nif has(\"autocmd\")\n   let conEmuMacro = \"!/mnt/c/utils/ConEmu/ConEmu/ConEmuC64.exe -guimacro setoption check\"\n   let beamCursor = conEmuMacro . \" 2531 \" . \"1 >/dev/null 2>&1 &\"\n   let blockCursor = conEmuMacro . \" 2532 \" . \"1 >/dev/null 2>&1 &\"\nau VimLeave * silent execute beamCursor | redraw!\n   au VimEnter * silent execute blockCursor | redraw!\nau InsertEnter * silent execute beamCursor | redraw!\n   au InsertLeave * silent execute blockCursor | redraw!\nendif\n``\nYou need to change this linelet conEmuMacro = \"!/mnt/c/utils/ConEmu/ConEmu/ConEmuC64.exe ....` to point to your ConEmuC executable. \nThis basically utilizes a combination of Vim auto-commands and ConEmu GUI macros to force ConEmu to change the cursor shape when Vim enters or leaves insert mode. Forcing Vim to redraw the screen (the redraw! above) is necessary after the cursor change, otherwise you will get screen artifacts. \nNeedless to say that this is a hack and forcing Vim to clean and redraw the screen each time you enter and leave insert mode like that causes a delay in your workflow.\n. If you are using Vim with WSL, there was a known WSL issue https://github.com/Microsoft/console/issues/68. That issue was fixed in a recent Windows 10 update. However, I don't know if this fix will enable ConEmu to detect the cursor change from the \"Real Console\". Perhaps @Maximus5 can shed more light on that.

I have no clue what are these paths for (I can only do assumptions).\nAnd I as a user have no clue where I can get this plugin. Why not to update it automatically?\n--\nI found a workaround to this bug: I copied content of the %ConEmu%/Plugins/ConEmu to the %Far%/Plugins/ConEmu. Sad that it's not mentioned anywhere. And that's not obvious\n. 1. The message should explains what is the problem and how to get rid of it. I still don't know how to fix this issue properly (and you didn't tell me the right steps).\n2. I agree that users should not copy files mannually. And I've checked the following:\n3. Removed ConEmu\n4. Removed Conemu folder from %Far%/Plugins\n5. Installed ConEmu\nAs the result, Far doesn't see ConEmu plugin.\nI've checked the documentation, it says \"By default, ConEmu will create a Task for each Far Manager version found on your PC.\". Probably that doesn't happen. How can I check this? \nHere is what I have.\n\n\n1. Your messages? kidding? You just said Just Delete old bad version. and this doesn't solve the issue. I don't want to increase a tension, I suggest to solve the problem first and than decide is it a bug or not. \n2. Then please explain what are the correct steps to get it work? \n. Why are you so annoyed? Be respectful.\nYou haven't said the way how to fix this issue.

    "raffylopez": "Thanks, that did it. The text on the checkbox sounds a little obscure IMHO, but I'd like to think that the one on the help balloon is much clearer.\n. Sorry if I wasn't too clear. This is just the plain vanilla vim.exe that comes installed automatically with graphical vim/gvim for windows, so I'm not running cygwin/msys. Strangely enough, I encounter no redraw-on-scroll issues when running vim.exe from either command prompt (cmd) nor from ConsoleZ, albeit without the excellent color support that conemu provides.. Thanks @grygus, but that didn't do the trick for me, nor did installing and running vim v7.4.872 and v8.0.599. I'll investigate a bit further when I've the time.. After setting the console size to 78 width and 35 height, the redraw-upon-pagescroll problem seems to have vanished. Not completely out of the woods though, since the redraw problem manifests itself again when a buffer is horizontally split into at least two panes and either one is page-scrolled.. I've made a quick recording of running vim under cmd, then in conemu. Near the end of the GIF you can see that the redraw bug under conemu seems to have gone when viewing in a single buffer (after the previously-mentioned screen dimensions redef), but then bringing up a split, then scrolling, still produces the anomalous redraw problem.\n\n. @ddiukariev Setting ttyscrollto a low value solved the issue entirely for me as well.

    "ErraticFox": "The one I linked in the problem description: https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html\n. I've already looked at that, but in your guide that I linked, you said \"Well, you may run wsl-con.cmd which would set up wslbridge for you.\". I did this. You also said to use the command conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t \"-new_console:C:%LOCALAPPDATA%\\lxss\\bash.ico\" \"-new_console:D:C:\\MSYS\\WSL\" -new_console:np to set up your new task to run Win10 Bash with 24 colors. I changed the C:\\MSYS\\WSL to my own folder, currently I'm using C:\\test as my wslbridge folder which contains all the files that were downloaded with wsl-con.cmd. \nWhen I run that new task with the command you gave which in my case is conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t \"-new_console:C:%LOCALAPPDATA%\\lxss\\bash.ico\" \"-new_console:D:C:\\test\" -new_console:np I get this as a result.\nFor further information, this is what my C:\\test looks like.\n. That does seem to make the task boot properly, but there's no 24 color support as seen here: \n\n. Was unaware, fixed it.\n. That works, though I have to specify the full path using the task parameters. If I take out the task parameters and do C:\\test\\wsl-con.cmd -run I get the error of conemu-cyg-32.exe not existing again. Why does the cmd file work but not conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t?

I might do the first one you mentioned, though could you explain what you meant by the second option?\n. Seems to have worked... I have one more problem, when starting it, every thing (like my PS1) starts at the bottom until I hit ctrl + l. What can I put in my .bashrc to make it clear or ctrl + l at the start?\nEDIT: I see where this is coming from as you said I'd have to scroll to the bottom of the buffer.

    "OddMorning": "I just encountered that problem and made a workaround that seems to be working\nAdd to ~/.bash_aliases\n```\n\"clear\" command that \"supports\" 24bit colors\nalias clear='clear; echo -ne \"\\e[32766H\\e[$((LINES - 1))A\"'\n```\nAdd to ~/.bashrc\n```\nClear the screen, scroll beyond limits, and set cursor at the first visible line\nclear; echo -ne \"\\e[32766H\\e[$((LINES - 1))A\"\nBind Ctrl+L to alias\nbind -x '\"\\C-l\": clear'\n``\nNow bash echoes the prompt beyond limits and bothclearandCtrl+l` work properly.\n\nP.S. That thing also enables support of bold and italic fonts! I thought they're completely dead on windows but it suddenly turned out they're not (normal console on top, console after \\033[9999H on bottom):\n\nP.S.S. Airline (aka powerline) for Vim can display bold font but it doesn't look like it scrolls screen 9999 lines down. How's did they do that?\n\n. Oh, now I see what alternative mode means, thanks!\n\nConEmu buffer may be greater than 9999 lines\n\nI'm aware of that limitation and originally tried to use \\e[32999H but any value bigger than 32768 behaves like 0.\nBut I just made some more tests and it turned out that \u201cworking area\u201d starts not after last buffer line, but after last buffer line minus screen height. I.e. set window height to 30 lines, buffer size to 1000 lines, then scroll 970 lines down, and lines between 970 and 1000 still render bold/italic font and 24bit colored cubes properly.\nIn short, \\e[32766H\\e[${LINES}A will work for every buffer size (I hope) so I edited my comment above.. @nickbudi Hmm, you're right, first line doesn't display 256 colors. But I just figured why, that was my mistake. \\e[32766H moves cursor to the buffer + line count line and \\e[${LINES}A moves cursor line count lines up. But I did not take into account current cursor position which shouldn't be included in line count so it moved cursor to the last line of the buffer area.\nIn short,  \\e[32766H\\e[$((LINES - 1))A should work with first line too (at least it does for me)..

    "maggu": "Yes, I can see how efficient it would be if it works for you. For me it doesn't, unfortunately.\nBasically, I want to make it work the way my brain expects it too. I don't want to be surprised that I pasted when I didn't intend to.\nIn pretty much every program there is, right clicking opens a menu. I also work a lot in OS X and Linux. I copy and paste between OS X and Windows (through Synergy). In Terminal.app, right clicking opens a menu. In every terminal program I've used on OS X and Linux, right clicking opens a menu.\nSo personally I feel that right clicking to paste badly breaks \"the principle of least surprise\". I don't want to have to stop and think about what OS and program I'm in at the moment, and how copy/paste might work in that particular environment.. I would pretty much expect it to work the way the \"Edit\" menu in ConEmu currently does. You might call it a shortcut. I would like the same options if I right click as if I had clicked on the system menu and chosen \"Edit\".\n\n\nthere is no selection, there is text in buffer\n\n\n\"Copy\" is greyed out.

If I \"Paste\" nothing is pasted and the selection disappears.\nI fail to see why it would make no sense or be bad behaviour. It's a different way to work. How can it be bad behaviour when more or less every Windows program works that way?\nIf I don't want \"Copy on Left Button Release\" enabled, it's another alternative to using the middle button to copy or navigating through the system menu every time.\nIn general, it could also enable a whole set of other features. For example, if \"GitHub\" is the active selection, the option 'Find text...' might change to 'Find \"GitHub\"'. But even if no such additional features were to be implemented, the option to open a menu would make the behaviour consistent with other software.. ",
    "dnut": "ConEmu's default RClick behavior is the least user-friendly in comparison with any terminal I know.\n@Maximus5 I can't comprehend how you could say that having the right click button open the menu is \"bad behavior.\" That's exactly the behavior almost anyone who has used a computer would expect. It seems crazy to me that middle click does nothing and right click only pastes, when it is well established everywhere else that right click means menu, and in Linux middle click means paste. I especially don't follow the idea, \"RClick menu has no sense at all.\" Opening a menu is the whole point of having a right click button.\nI understand you like right click to paste, but I disabled that and switched mine to middle click for paste because I am a Linux user and that makes a lot more sense to me. When paste for right click is disabled, it would be great if, like any other terminal, right click would open the menu without having to hold down ctrl.\nI understand you do this for free and I don't expect you to implement features just because I said so, but I want you to know that I strongly disagree with your position about bad behavior.. > You can set right click to open the menu.\nHow? The dropdown menus for \"Mouse button actions\" only contain \\<None>, Copy, Paste, and Auto. None of these result in getting a menu when you right click..

Besides that, my vimrc should be fine and it is not really reproducable. It happens often, on a nearly daily basis, but I have no way to reliably reproduce it except of waiting for it to happen.. Still happening often to me. :-(. ### Versions\nConEmu build: 180422 x64 (Updated yesterday, so not 100% sure that it still happens, but very likely as it happened on a nearly daily basis in the last 3 years)\nOS version: Windows 10 Enterprise x64\nUsed shell version (Far Manager, git-bash, cmd, powershell, cygwin, whatever): Cygwin Bash 4.4.12(3)-release (i686-pc-cygwin)\nProblem description\nAs described previously, sometimes crashes of vim and / or less and following inoperability of the whole console tab\nSteps to reproduce\nAs described previously, not sure what is causing it and how to trigger it, but happens pretty often when using the console\nActual results\nAs described previously, sometimes crashes of vim and / or less and following inoperability of the whole console tab\nExpected results\nAs described previously, not having crashing programs that only crash if run in ConEmu and thereby also make the whole console unusable\n. So you tried to workaround that bug and thus broke the real functionality?\nIsn't there some better way? I seldomly resize the ConEmu window so I would personally prefer to have the proper colors where I want them.\nAlso I don't find where I would set the Legacy mode.\nIf I show the real console, the colors are properly displayed like expected.. Ah, now I found the setting.\nBut would that solve my problem, or would it just make the original issues go away that you tried to workaround?\nI understand that resizes might show a bad behavior. But actually I did not have any problems with vanishing text. I would really prefer some setting to switch this behavior off, or maybe have instead some button or hotkey \"make black-on-black text visible\" or something like that.\nBy working around that bad Windows behaviour, you break the real use-cases which look utter ugly now. :-(\nIf isatty detection would work properly, I'd use almost black on black, but Gradle without progress and colors is very bad, so I cannot use the Cygwin connector.. Seems to work fine in current version, thanks. Yeah, it seems this was fixed now. Well, actually it uses a native library to determine whether the console is attached to a terminal or not. The project is https://github.com/adammurdoch/native-platform, the corresponding code that returns false is https://github.com/adammurdoch/native-platform/blob/master/src/main/cpp/win.cpp#L404-L419.. I also reported it at adammurdoch/native-platform#26 now in case it is more a problem of the detection process, but I'm still not sure which side is causing this.. Ah, so it IS the detection that is erroneous, because it does not do the correct checks when run in the Connector or in Git Bash and thus msys, right? Can you tell me how the detection has to be done properly?. No, the check tries to determine whether a terminal is attached to the streams. If a terminal is attached, there is e. g. progress information and colors shown. If no terminal is attached, e. g. stdout is piped to another command, no progress information is displayed and no colors are shown.\nBesides that, a ConEmu specific solution is probably not the best solution if the reason it is not working correctly is the same as for Git Bash and there could be a way used that works for this situation.. It is not my tool, I'm just a user and sometimes contributor. Just searching for a solution I could suggest and you sounded like you could have an idea. :-) . Ah, great, thanks. Having a setting is fine.\nI'd expect it to keep the old behavior as default setting if it had a switch, so I didn't search for it.\nI'm happy again now. :-). ",

The disadvantage is that you cannot use the tab switching shortcut that you're used to, but are forced to use Win+PgUp/Down and similarly with other ConEmu shortcuts (which I don't use). But it's okay-ish for me as a temporary solution until Windows fixes their console.. > Which exactly?\nI don't remember all the details, but here's what I tried for sure:\n1. cmder+wslbridge: doesn't fix ctrl+space\n2. msys2+ssh: programs (such as less, emacs, etc) start crashing after a while, I believe it might be about this (yes, it also happens in cygwin): http://cygwin.1069669.n5.nabble.com/Some-programs-vi-ssh-crash-when-screen-buffer-height-is-big-td109852.html Besides, you have to set up the ssh server and make it start up upon Windows login.

No, I use it as it came from the download page. Should I be?. What does it do?.

It may have been an update to ConEmu or some other change. But it started at the same time.. I tried ProcessMonitor, but the hole in the timings appears random :( There is way too much data for me to see anything without something to look for. I have the feeling that wslbridge is struggling with something, but I cant see anything that can help.\nI ran the command you gave and I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Does it write a log somewhere? I tried looking here C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu, but didn't find anything. The only interesting thing is that the bash produced by this command runs considerably slower. It is noticeable especially when running mc and exiting - there is a second or so where the screen is blank.. Process monitor: I used contains conemu and contains wsl. Didn't help me. If you point me to some specific events to look for, that would be great.\nOfficial wslbridge: back when I enabled it, I downloaded it manually and followed the instructions on your website. I could try downloading it again and modify the task's parameters to use that. The delay may have started appearing when you bundled the files. I install every alpha release that came as an update.\nLogs going to do that now and post back.. ConEmu-gui-12108.log\nConEmu-srv-17728.log\nConEmu-con-17728.log\nThere are the logs. I used -log4. I closed it after I saw the prompt.. I downloaded wslbridge from here https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge/releases and the installed wsltty, and then compared the two files, they seem identical. Then copied the bundled cygwin1.dll to wsl2 folder (along with wslbridge.dll and wslbridge-backend) and changed the task as follows:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl2;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt\nIt has the same delay. Can I take it that you don't have such delay?. I managed to record a video of the delay:\n\nIt's a crappy gif, but you can see the delay between opening the new tab and the appearing of the blue and green prompt.. I installed wsltty and there is also a delay there, but not as much (maybe 1-2 seconds vs 3-4 with ConEmu).\nI have Visual Studio 2017 and git installed. Not sure about C++ tools, but I could install them if needed. I haven't installed Cygwin, I am not sure what to do with it.\nWhat do you want me to do?. No, I used windows Add/Remove Features (before it was in the store) and upgraded it.. @Maximus5 wsl.exe is instant.\nI am not sure how to setup Cygwin to test that.. @Maximus5, I just noticed something. When a new console is opened, it ends up waiting with a text like \"wslbridge.exe[64]:some number\". The moment the prompt appears, the \"some number\" changes to some other number. Is that a port or a process id?. So why does it change?\n. I said it because I thought it might have something to do with the delay - two wslbridge processes.. I have defender. I will try without it and post back.. nope, no change.. \nIf it was related, wouldn\u2019t we all have delays?\n. @Maximus5 Adding the whole ConEmu folder as an exception did reduce the delay, but it didn't remove all of it. :(.

Since you are bound by the shortcomings of old controls; why not simply tackle the problem differently.  How about a hotkey to bring up a list of \"tabs\".  These tabs could be named differently and colored differently; and take up, on the popup/popover much more space for detail than a tab could.  That way one could even lose the tabs altogether.

You're right -- I have bound Ctrl-C to \"kill active process\". So imagine my delight when you mention the other command, which still has the default binding Win+Shift+Delete... and does quickly kill the current process without confirmation (as you say) -- but also offers to kill cmd.exe if there is no process running (which makes sense because it's a kill command).

Going down that route means I would have to pre-define different hotkeys for different windows no?\nIt would be much cleaner in my opinion to use the same hotkey based on which window has focus. That way, there is no configuration and you don't have to memorize different hotkeys for different windows.\nAlso, how would I setup a hotkey to minimize/restore all windows via config? After reading the docs I don't see how that would work?. Sorry for the confusion, but I understood the configuration file per window solution.\nMy thoughts were, it would be nice as a possible feature to get the process id of the focused ConEmu window on hotkey press and minimize/restore that way. It would also be nice to add a hotkey to minimize/restore all ConEmu window instances as a feature. Let me explain why:\nCurrently if you have every window as topmost you can only hide the first instance. The obvious solution to mitigate this problem is to turn off topmost. Turning off topmost however, means that you must ALT+TAB to show all ConEmu window instances, which is a problem because usually each window has it's own purpose but you most likely need to see/use all of them in tandem.\nI am not sure if these features are in the scope of ConEmu, maybe it is the responsibility of another program (i.e. AutoHotkey)?.

Commands like ssh or plink do not provide a feature to run completely windowless, they do require the console, unfortunately.\nAlso, hiding the console in ConEmu is not really completely hiding it, the tab could still be accessed via Right Clicking on the tab bar and then -> \"Console List\" -> the tab.\nThis would provide the best of both worlds: the tab is usually hidden, but still available when it is needed, to check the output, to stop the tunnel, etc.\nP.S.

Here's what plink author says: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/no-terminal-window.html\nAs for the second suggestion, sorry, I just don't understand it. How can I run the server in the same console? I connect via ssh/plink to remote servers. Both ssh/plink don't allow to run completely windowless. If you know how to run those commands without the need for console, I am all ears! :). I am running plink.exe, which is basically another ssh client. I am opening multiple tunnels via ssh (ssh and plink have this ability to act as a SOCKS proxy tunneling the requests to the target host, this is done via -D switch).\nSo I run things like that:\nplink REMOTE_HOST -D LOCAL_HOST:PORT\nThe problem is that plink cannot be executed without console, so I have two choices:\n\nJust invoke those commands via BAT files and ignore the CMD windows flying around. Ugly.\nInvoke those commands from within ConEmu and then ignore multiple (more or less) useless tabs that consume the valuable tab space and just are annoying in general.\n\nAn ability to hide tab is beneficial here. Not completely and not forever hiding. If I'd like to know what's going on in those tabs and with those connections, I could access the hidden tabs via \"Console list\" menu.\nI don't think that I am the only one who is trying to open long-living ssh tunnels on Windows.... :) And for such folks the ability to hide some consoles could be quite beneficial.. I cannot really run two commands one by one, since the first one does not return the control back to the console. I have to run all these commands in separate tabs.

If I double-click, wait about a half second, and then press middle mouse, I get the updated clipboard contents on that and all future pastes.\nAttaching an image of my settings.  I do not have \"reset selection on left button release\" set.\n. So \"auto\" means \"immediately copy the selection to the clipboard, then paste it\"?  I could live with that.\nOut of curiosity, why not copy as soon as you have a changed, non-empty selection due to a mouse event, instead of waiting for a timer (presumably, a timer set to the system double-click time)?  In that case, if the user is triple-clicking (for example), you'd copy immediate on double-click and then copy again on triple-click, which seems OK.. \"auto\" seems to cause unpredictable behavior:\n Sometimes, middle-clicking clears the current selection without pasting anything, then clicking again pastes.\n Sometimes, middle-clicking (quickly after double-clicking) pastes the current selection once, but repeated clicks paste the old clipboard contents (so, basically, the middle click did not force a clipboard update, and the selection was cleared before the timer kicked off).\nI agree that \"reset on copy\" is incompatible with automatically copying.  I don't have a solution to that, other than to not do the behavior I'm proposing in that case.  OTOH, the other objections you raise seem to be addressable.  (I'm one of the folks who's worked on clipboard implementation stuff in Google Chrome, so I'm not entirely unfamiliar with this space.)  Copying does take time, but not enough time to actually notice when triggered by user actions (since those are comparatively slow and infrequent).  Copying does alert other applications monitoring the clipboard, but that's sort of desirable in this case.  I'm not sure what would cause a failure to copy twice; maybe if a monitoring app reads the clipboard change and modifies the clipboard on a timer itself?  But in that case it would interfere with copying once too.  As for copying not being required if you paste immediately, the problem there is that the pasted text wouldn't reflect the clipboard state, so (as noted above) repeated pastes don't get the same value.\nBasically, I'm attempting to reproduce a typical Linux bash environment, where middle-mouse would cause the current selection to be copied to the clipboard immediately and then pasted.  It seems like \"auto\" doesn't quite do that, and \"paste\" doesn't work because copying isn't auto-triggered on mouse-based selection changes.  I don't know how else to achieve this.. I see.  I don't want either of those behaviors, so it sounds like auto is not for me.\nI don't know if you have any proposal for how to better emulate the Linux sort of behavior via the \"paste\" mechanism.. I installed it, but it doesn't seem to fix my testcase:\n\nSelect some text with left-drag\nImmediately press middle-click to paste\n\nExpected: Selected text is pasted\nActual: Previous clipboard contents are pasted. Using that, the mouse buttons don't have the same functions as in my case, but I still see a delay-based difference:\n\nSelect some text with left-drag\nLeft-click once to cancel dragging\nRight-click to paste text\n\nWhen doing all three steps in very rapid succession, the pasted text is the previous clipboard contents.  If I wait a bit after the initial left-drag, the pasted text is the dragged text.. ",

Just a couple of suggestions, based on my experience:\n\nWith Powershell becoming the default shell, I reckon it's worth mentioning somewhere in the UI around the appropriate settings that it won't work w/o manual adjustment\nfunction prompt may very well be already present in $Profile and/or overridden by other modules. Besides, the snippet that is currently shown in the manual does some other stuff that is not really needed to update the directory. The following snippet, when placed last in $Profile, keeps any customisation to the prompt already made by the user explicitly or by modules they have installed:\n```\nfunction Update-ConEmu {\n  if ($env:ConEmuBaseDir -ne $null) { & ConEmuC.exe -StoreCWD $(get-location).ProviderPath }\n}\n\nfunction Prompt() {\n  if (Test-Path Function:\\PrePrompt) { PrePrompt }\n  Update-ConEmu\n}\n``. I'd say put a hyperlink with the link you gave me right next to thecurrent shell directory` text in the Tab templates description.

    "AquaeAtrae": "@Maximus5 Thanks for all your hard work here. :)\nI'm glad to hear this was fixed for \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\". I do see it works correctly when using bash.exe or wsl.exe directly. \nHowever, the only documented method to show 256-colors involves calling scripts (a .cmd script which starts wslbridge and runs a .sh script within it). So understandably, we can no longer close the window without it thinking that I still have an incomplete process (the scripts).\nI don't understand how wsl-con.cmd and its escape sequence (\\e[9999H) enables 256 colors through the hidden RealConsole to appear properly within ConEmu. However, after a lot of experimentation I found a simpler method that works great. However, it only works once. The required Escape character is replaced with a \"?\" after closing ConEmu. \nCan you fix the Task settings to permanently store all (unicode) characters including this Escape character? And can you document this or a better solution for those of us using WSL?\nHere's the method's I've seen in your current documentation.\nCloses nicely but only 16 colors...\nbased on \"Preferred way to run WSL\" .\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & set \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pnm:/mnt -t bash\n256 colors but appears as an Incomplete Operation when closing...\nbased on \"How to get 24-bit colors working\" which runs wsl-con.cmd and then wsl-boot.sh within WSL.\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & set \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl\\wsl-con.cmd -run\nSUCCESS (...TEMPORARILY)\nAs I was working on documenting this, I believe I've come up with a Task definition that successfully accomplishes everything without the additional script layers. I'm posting the method I used in hopes that you and others might be able to reproduce my results.\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & echo \u001b[9999H & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pnm:/mnt -C~ -t bash\nIMPORTANT: \"echo {escape char}[9999H\" is the actual escape character (Alt 027) which others can copy and paste from here since github won't present it as is.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CCARyWx.png\nConEmu 171025 [64]\nLinux Mist 4.4.0-17134-Microsoft #112-Microsoft Thu Jun 07 22:57:00 PST 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nDescription:    Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS\n. PS: I think I found a permanent solution that works despite special characters getting lost from the Settings. I do still suggest that would be good to fix as it may affect some with different languages and character sets.\nRather than present the magic escape sequence from Windows, I found it also works coming from within the WSL shell. (Again, I have no idea what it actually does to affect the colors.) \nSo I simplified my Start Task even further to be...\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pnm:/mnt -C~ -t bash -l -i\nThen, to enable true color support, I added the following line to my .bashrc file.\n```\nEnables 256-color (true color) for ConEmu\necho -e '\\e[9999H'\n```\nIf you use zsh or fish in your Start Task, just add this to .zshrc or .fishrc (I believe).\nSUCCESS (ALWAYS!)\nAnd that seems to do the trick. I can now see 256 colors and can immediately close the wslbridge window as expected.. ",

    "jxskiss": "This issue also confuse me for days. Some feedback here.\nI'm running the latest windows 10 rs3 1709, with a fresh downloaded portable ConEmuPack.170807,\n\ndefault cmd, works well, no extra space on command line\ndefault bash invoked with either \"bash.exe\" or \"wsl.exe\", works well, no extra space.\nzsh without oh-my-zsh invoked with \"wsl.exe zsh\", works well, no extra space.\nzsh with oh-my-zsh invoked with \"wsl.exe zsh\", with oh-my-zsh enabled, THE EXTRA SPACE APPEARS., and behaves like the above comments.\n\nDon't know where the problem is, just feedback.. Also, after tried bash-it, it also has this SPACE issue (bare bash session not).. https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6007#issuecomment-299684982\n\nKuromiAK commented on 7 May:\nAfter some testing (161206 stable), it appears that ConEmu is confused by character '\u279c' (arrow in robbyrussell), '\ue0b0' (powerline arrow) and '\ue0a0' (powerline branch symbol). The symbols are supposed to be 1 character wide but ConEmu advances cursor by 2 characters when they are inputed. ConEmu also only retracts by 1 character when these symbols are deleted.\n\nI can confirm the issue only appears with oh-my-zsh theme enabled.\nIs there any plan to fix this?\nAs workaround, just copy the theme to custom directory, and drop or replace the characters fix this.. ",

    "jakara": "still have this issue on windows 10 1709.\nand looks like it happens on all powerline themes, not just ZSH in WSL, for example I'm using powershell+on-my-posh+agnoster theme. and this theme works fine in native powershell console.\nAnother interesting thing i've been notice is that, this happens when I set the \"Language for non-unicode program\" = zh_cn, if I change this value to en_us, it works perfectly, but then the native powershell won't show  chinese charactors any more, regardless any codepage, encoding settings >_<\nDose anyone know how to make this Language for non-unicode program setting only set for ComEmu/cmder?. @Maximus5  I\u2018m using ConEmu 180206 [64] {ALPHA}, via cmder(portable).\nI'm not sure whether this issue is related to system locale setting, but:\nin zh_cn:\n\nthe cursor position is wrong, but native powershell:\n\nworks fine!\nin en_us:\n\ncmder works perfectly, but the native:\n\nwont show any chinese charactor. ",
    "sql-sith": "@jakara For Powershell to show Chinese characters, you may have to change your Powershell font. You can check by clicking the control box (the Powershell icon way up in the top-left corner of the Window) and choosing Properties and checking the font in there. I use a font I really like (Bitstream Vera Sans Mono) but I can't use it well for CJK characters. In this screenshot, I pasted in the character \u7691:\n\nHowever, if I go to Properties and just change the font to NSimSun (or any font with good CJK support) and the character appears properly. I didn't even have to re-type it. I think it may be possible that you are accidentally using a font that doesn't support the characters you need. Just a thought.\n\n. ",
    "jeud": "Dear @jakara\nI have found this guideline setting https://github.com/fredjoseph/cmder-powerline-prompt, unfortunately it's for Cmder.\nI have installed some powerline fonts, and this is my current setting.\n\nUnfortunately the prompt has no changes, please guide what should I do, because according to the guide line Cmder and ConEmu seem to have different folder structure I'm not sure it's about executing .lua files or not, so I have no ideas what further to go because most guideline I could find are about ConEmu with PowerShell or Cmder, but I intend to use the powerline font with MS-DOS prompt not PowerShell.\nPlease guide, thanks..

    "mhtvsSFrpHdE": "Now I know the keypoint of the issue.\nIt's the chcp utf8 command in Environment settings.\nThe Default Windows XP SP3 cmd shell won't accept cmd script, seems this is not ConEmu's fail.\nOpen a cmd and chcp 65001, cmd script is won't work, too.. ",

    "akomakom": "In case it's useful, my AutoHotKey workaround:\n1. Set hotkeys (All are Win+Ctrl+Shift):\n- z: focus to ConEmu\n- x: focus to child\n- PgDn: Switch previous console\n- PgUp: Switch next console\n2. AutoHotKey Script:\n```\nIfWinActive ahk_class VirtualConsoleClass\n^+PgUp::Send, {shift down}{ctrl down}{lwin down}z{PgUp}{lwin up}{ctrl up}{shift up}\n^+PgDn::Send, {shift down}{ctrl down}{lwin down}z{PgDn}{lwin up}{ctrl up}{shift up}\nIfWinActive\n```\nThis assigns next/previous to Ctrl+Shift+PgUp and Ctrl+Shift+PgDn (^+ = Ctrl+Shift), and when pressed it changes focus to ConEmu and presses Win+Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/Down (which are the keys we configured above).  You could also add \"x\" after PgUp and PgDn (eg: \"..z{PgUp}x...\") to move focus back to child, but I haven't found it to be necessary (it happens anyway).. Thanks for the link to the connector, that does seem to work a lot better than what I proposed.   The keywords on that page did not match what I thought I was looking for, so I ignored it.   There is a lot of potential text to sift through when figuring this out from zero knowledge.\nThat said, I do not entirely agree on the bad UX.  Since ConEmu has a feature to attach random windows to the tabbed view, I'd still opt for the ability to enforce some level of global hotkey control over the tabs.  The Win-Q and Win-# hotkey option is nice, but not very flexible, and I don't see why it couldn't be configurable, but then again I'm not familiar with the code.. ",

One solution that works well for PowerShell would be to do something like this:\nPowerShell\nyour-long-running-exe.exe; [console]::beep(500, 300)\nThe semicolon ensures that the beep() will be run after your .exe completes. The first argument to beep() is the pitch, and the second is the duration in milliseconds.\nNote: For this work, you have to have \"Suppress bells\" disabled in ConEmu.

Because ConEmu is a Windows app, I'd expect it to run on Windows. I am using Windows 10, FWIW.\nI also would expect the OS to be more or less irrelevant to the detection of escape codes and rendering of a font style in a terminal emulator.\nThe shell can do funny things with escape sequences, though I have debugged that already. Bash, cmd, etc. are passing the proper escape sequences. ConEmu is not handling them as intended.\nThe link to BashOnWindows has nothing about italics. I do see some other escape sequences which have been implemented by Microsoft and a whole bunch which have not. I presume your hands are tied to their implementation. One has to wonder just how much complexity must go into the processing of ANSI text data in order to get it to show up on a display. What a world. =)\nCheers. Hmm... this concept of \"connector\" is new to me. I'll look into it...\nI checked it out. Does this mean I would need MSYS1 or 2 or Cygwin (as opposed to WSL) in order to get a more POSIX terminal?

I can confirm that this is still present on 190303. If it can help make a diagnostic, I think that the \"mouse characters\" begin to show when mouse clicks are not useful anymore.\nFor example, using two panes with tmux and mouse mode enabled, the first click in another pane changes the active pane as it should and nothing is displayed; but as soon as no real action is intended (extra or \"unsupported\" click), the characters appear.\nSame with the wheel: if you wheel up and there is things to display, everything seems to go well, but if you just start a tmux session and try to wheel down, characters appear. If you went up and down, just the \"extra wheel movements\" are displayed.. Hi @Maximus5 \nI am using most of the time zsh on WSL Debian Testing and a custom zsh task.\nFor the sake of debugging, I changed it to:\n- Ubuntu release: not Ubuntu, but Debian testing on WSL\n- Default task: default {bash} task (set \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt)\n- tmux 2.8 with mouse enabled. .tmux.conf hereafter (I deleted classical prefix remap and disabled all my plugins for debugging):\nset -s escape-time 0\nset -g base-index 1\nset -g history-limit 50000\nset -g display-time 4000\nset -g focus-events on\nset -g mouse on\n- TERM=xterm-256color in bash; TERM=screen in tmux\n- The issue is present either on localhost or ssh (all my servers are Debian though)\n- It is button of the mouse that display the issue, and there is characters appearing for all of them (right, left, mouse click, mouse wheel up and mouse wheel down).\nEdit : I just figured out that the things that are written depend of the position of the mouse on the term!\nSo without moving the mouse at all:\n- left click triggers the apparition of 3;52;16m or 0;52;16M, 52 & 16 corresponding probably to the cursor position (column and line);\n- right click triggers 2;**;**M but also sometimes 3;**;**m (which seems weird for the latter, maybe it's due to the copy/paste mechanisms that triggers some events with right and left buttons?);\n- middle ckick triggers 1;**;**M but also sometimes 3;**;**m (copy/paste again?);\n- mouse wheel down consistently triggers 65;**;**M; mouse wheel up 64;**;**M (note that when there is something to wheel up to, it starts displaying only when the action can't be done... Like if the signal is transmitted normally but once there is nowhere to go, mouse codes are starting to be displayed);\n- I have a mouse with supplementary buttons, so I can also have codes in 35;**;**m with other buttons.... I have absolutely no idea if it can matters, but on the Info panel:\n- on bash, I have xterm|cygwin;\n- running tmux, I have xterm|AppKeys|BrPaste|cygwin|mouse=x54. Is the mouse=x54 normal?\nEdit: Could this be related to our issue? https://superuser.com/questions/417027/why-are-random-characters-inserted-into-my-tmux-session .  The problem there seemed to be that the terminal didn't support \"utf-8 mouse\" (whatever that means)\n. @Maximus5 It seems that the culprit here is the set -s escape-time 0 in .tmux.conf!\n\nescape-time time\nSet the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key sequences. The default is 500 milliseconds.\n\nThis escape-time is often set to 0 in tmux to avoid lagging with vim, but I guess here it didn't let the mouse click time to \"finish\"... clicking? Putting it to 20 ms seems to do the job without making vim lag too much.\n@tfriedel @XA21X , would you be in the same situation here, with escape-time modified in your .tmux.conf?. OK, thanks for the info. As far as I'm concerned, the issue is fixed; but maybe @tfriedel, @XA21X or @pingzing could confirm if the issue was the same for them?. @Maximus5 I confirm the issue above with zsh in tmux, using Conemu 190108:\n\nLaunching ls command:\n\nconnector-9928-out.log\nconnector-9928-in.log\ntmux launched directly in WSL terminal emulator works as intended.\n. Please note that it is only partially due to zsh.\nIndeed, the issue doesn't appears at first with bash:\n\nbut clearing the terminal with C-l is also broken:\n\nconnector-8416-out.log\nconnector-8416-in.log. As stated in #1775, the issue appears on tmux 2.8 but not on 2.3, running Debian WSL.. @Maximus5 The issue with the leading blank line is solved with 190217 as far as I'm concerned.. Using ConEmu 170807 (I do not know if this release includes the change @Maximus5 made in the commit 8528912), with a French keyboard, all AltGr+\"number\" keys are working except the tilde. \nFurthermore, arrow keys with Git-Bash are now broken ([Ctrl]+[p] or +[n] work fine for retrieving history and arrow keys are OK launching directly bash).\nconemu-msys2-64.exe --keys give <x1B><x5B:[><x41:A><x1B><x5B:[><x42:B><x1B><x5B:[><x44:D> when pressing arrow keys.. > Arrows are working properly.\nYes indeed, I am sorry, a remanent option -new_console:p was causing the arrow keys not to work.. @zommuter Thank you for reporting that, I thought I was crazy. I have the same behavior with Git-Bash and conemu-msys2 connector but was not able to reproduce it properly (didn't think it could be the reboot that caused the problem) for arrow keys. According to which one is loaded first in Conemu, the arrows are functioning erratically. . Using 170807 and a French azerty keyboard, all AltGr+numbers combinations are working, except for the tilde (configured in dead key or not).\nHowever, After one reboot, using Git-Bash 2.14.0.windows.1:\n\n{Git Bash} = set \"PATH=%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\usr\\bin;%PATH%\" & \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\Git\\git-cmd.exe\" --no-cd --command=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe /usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i\n{BashColor} = set MSYSTEM=MINGW64 & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe\n\n{Bash} = \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe\" -l -i\n\n\nlaunching {Git Bash}: arrow keys are working perfectly\n\nlaunching {BashColor} using connector configuration found in the doc:  arrow keys do not work properly.\nafter this, launching {Bash}, then {BashColor}, the arrow keys are working perfectly in all consoles!\n\nEdit: I do not know if it is relevant, but when using {BashColor} it launch \"MINGW64\" (as shown in the command). When launching directly {Bash}, it shows \"MSYS\". Maybe one need to be launched before the other? However, it doesn't explain why {Git Bash}, which is also MINGW64, works directly after the reboot.. Here are the wanted screenshots, the difference I see is the win32|msys2 when not working, vs xterm|msys2 when working.\nArrow keys not working\n\nArrow keys working\n\n. > I wonder, without ConEmu are you able to enter single dead key? For example, I have to type AltGr+~ twice to get two tildas printed. Is there a way to print one tilde?\n@Maximus5 When the tilde is configured as a deadkey, you have to type [AltGr]+[2] (on French keyboard) then [Space]. Using a layout without tilde as a deadkey, you just press [AltGr]+[2].. @Maximus5 I cannot reproduce it on my work computer today either and I will have limited connectivity the next coming week. What I suggest is maybe keeping this topic for the \"tilde\" issue and I will file a new issue when (and if) I succeed to produce appropriate logs.. After 5 days using the connector, I wasn't able to reproduce the comportment after multiple reboots of the computer... It might have been a bug in the configuration that was overwritten after reinstallation of the program.\nHowever, concerning the \"tilde\" issue, the problem is still there. I do not know if the commit 9a209c1, related to gh-1224, is supposed to fix this. \nIf this information can be of any help to narrow down the issue, git-bash with the connector doesn't show anything when pressing AltGr+2, but Vim displays in normal mode ^@ when the combination is pressed, instead of ~.\n. @Maximus5 Problem solved for tilde not configured as a dead key with Alpha 170814.\nFor the win32/xterm mix-up, I am not able to reproduce it. Sorry for that, it might have been some issue with my personal installation at the time.. Could you give an example of that with bash? Using answer 2 or tweet 1 from the doc just reproduce the issue described above (i.e. the global behaviour is perfect but the last console doesn't close as long as ssh-agent is running or ConEmu closed by hand).\nEvaluating in a first git-bash eval $(ssh-agent) then ConEmuC64.exe -export=ALL SSH_* doesn't effectively export the variables in the other terms:\n\nConEmuC64: process git-cmd.exe PID=1660 was skipped: noninteractive or lack of ConEmuHk\n\nThus, it would be great if we could work a solution out; given the fact that the same scripts (even those given in ConEmu's help) work seamlessly with git-cmd + bash, but impedes the closing of ConEmu with git-cmd + conemu-msys2-64.exe + bash.. Thanks for your script. It inspired me to adapt the \"official\" script  from Github.\nYou can find it here: https://gist.github.com/techexo/0ea75bf7136f53c7f8255a58db4ac5bb\n(text edited after slight modification of script)\nThe trick is to launch via ConEmuC ssh-agent in a \"classical\" git-bash environment. In that way, the process will be killed when logging out of git-bash. \nIt works like a charm and it is only slightly modified from Github, but I still feel like this is a hack. I do not understand why the script works perfectly with git-bash and forbid the closing of ConEmu when launched with git-bash+connector. In my opinion, the \"kill\" message from ConEmu to ssh-agent is blocked by the connector, or not sent at all.. @connerbw That is indeed the same issue than described before: when using the connector, ssh-agent is not killed at logout.. @Maximus5 The issue is still present. There is the exact same problem described in #1159 .\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1159#issuecomment-450538482.\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1159#issuecomment-463228859\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1159#issuecomment-463231476\nI am currently trying to figure out what is causing this, because using tmux+zsh in an SSH session doesn't lead to the issue on another of my computer. It could either be a ZSH theme issue, or a different tmux version, or an oh-my-zsh issue. I'll update this feed.\nEdit: I confirm that the issue is present on tmux 2.8 (Debian testing), but not on tmux 2.3 (Debian stable), whatever the theme used.. @Maximus5 The issue with the leading blank line is solved with 190217 as far as I'm concerned.. @Maximus5 Both issues are still present on 190225 (drawing issue, and mouse clicks & wheel)\n\nconnector-4720-out.log\nconnector-4720-in.log\n. Hi @Maximus5,\nThanks for your answer. I use \"Powerline Consolas\", which is Consolas patched with \"powerline\" symbols.\nHowever, it is indeed drawn perfectly once I disable the option \"Alternative font\". Enabling this option (still with Powerline consolas) shifts the lines as shown before.\nSo we can say the drawing issue is solved (for me anyway).\nThe issue with mouse clicks displayed in input fields still remains however (and makes tmux almost impossible to use with mouse support). I want to emphasize that is not only shown, it is actual characters added to available fields (command line, text editor...), so one misclick and you have to write again the whole sentence ; you cannot use the mouse wheel etc.. I've tried the latest update 190303. Everything is drawn as it should as soon as I disable Alternative font.\nIf you want to have a more in-depth look, I use this font: https://github.com/runsisi/consolas-font-for-powerline ; but as I don't have a use for Alternative font, this issue can be closed as far as I'm concerned..

So e.g. i have 69 lines fit into visible area. As soon as I set scroll step to 35 I start getting redraw issue. But I do not get it if I set 34 and below. I also noticed that when I resize conEmu the vim setting (set scroll) gets automatically updated. And looks like it tries to keep this value to match 50% of lines visible but sometimes seems to set value higher than 50% and that when issue emerges.. I found a fix. There are number of options available for vim that control how it behaves when sending output to terminal. So it seems that defaults just doesn't work well with conEmu. So to fix the issue just use :set ttyscroll=0 (actually you can set to higher value for details read docs on option). \nAlso Maximus5 if you can, it would be nice if you read chapter 4 at http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/term.html and maybe you can suggest some better way to fix it..

Good morning\nThanks again for helping me with the last few questions.  I have one more and then I think I am good\nWhen I start ConEmu with a list of tabbed startup programs (e.g. from the -run option) when I stop those apps, the tab goes away.  But if I start up a new tab while ConEmu is up and I stop the application within that tab, the tab stays resident.  I want the \u201cstay resident\u201d behavior even when I start the applications through the -run option such that when I stop the app, the tab doesn\u2019t go away.  How can I achieve this on the initial startup sequence?\nExample:\nWhen I start ConEmu I have 4 programs that create 4 tabs.  This works great.  But once the application finishes the tab shuts down.\nIf instead I bring up ConEmu manually and start 4 new tabs via Win+x and start the exact same applications, when they stop, the tab stays resident.  This is the behavior I am wanting even when initially the applications are started automatically.\nI am sure there is a setting for this but I can\u2019t find it.\nThanks in advance\nFWIW, I love this program\nTroy Stauffer | Kimputing, Inc.\ntroy@kimputing.comtroy@kimputing.com  |  www.kimputing.comhttp://www.kimputing.com/\nPhone: +1.512.551.5526  |  Office: +1.512.551.5520\n15912 RR 620 Suite 204, Austin, TX, USA  78717\n. I am not sure I see anything relating to what I am after.\nAll I want is for the tab to stay resident after the application stops.\nWhen I start a new tab using Win+x it works exactly the way I need it to.\nSo when I start new tabs using the -run switch, I just need those tabs to also stay resident upon the applications exit, within that same tab.\nI would send a screen shot but I am not sure how to capture what I am talking about.\nTab1-Tab4 are started via -run\nTab5 is started via Win+x\nWhen applications in Tab1-Tab4 end, the tab closes\nWhen the applicaton in Tab5 ends, the tab stays open.

Awesome.  seems obvious now.  Didn't know you could do this level and I see it is already here, albeit with Ctrl-PgUp.\nI am curious though, what is the Apps key?  I know some keyboards have a special key but mine does not so I wondered what that translates to.. I read that before but it doesn't tell me where it is if you don't have that key.  I have tried alt-sh-f10 + f (for find).  I have tried alt-f and I can't get the find hotkey to work.  that is the only one I have tried that needs the apps key.. This actually isn\u2019t what I need really.  What I need is simple, and what others have been asking for as well.  I need to be able to clear the screen.\nI am running a jetty server, which suspends the actual command prompt, so I am not able to type cls or clear.  Ctrl-L doesn\u2019t work and I can\u2019t reset the console.  I simple want to clear the buffer.\nThere is nothing I can figure out which will allow me to do this.\nIf you look at the attached screen print, you can see that the console isn\u2019t actually \u201creleased\u201d\n[cid:image001.png@01D36F6B.F16A3690]\nYou already can\n\nAutomatically log all console output to separate files\nClear console contents by hotkeys\n\nI believe these features cover your issue\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1353#issuecomment-350054148, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADEfS_ZBwZmj0OlC1qViWSM32GKkxVz8ks5s-C61gaJpZM4Q5cS8.\n. Sorry for not understanding.  I do now and this is exactly what I needed.  Thank you. ",
    "Ryonez": "Ugh, what a mess. I can barely tell what is happening.\nI think @tstauffer ended up with what I'm facing.\nBasicly, if you open ComEmu with a something like a bat file, or a specific task, it'll try to run that bat or task again when you try to create a new console via Win +x, or by clicking this \n\n button.\nSo in my case I have my computer run a .bat file when it boots to start speedfan. ConEmu hooks it, and when you try to to make a new console, ConEmu will start and load the .bat file again. Basically, it'll always run the last command in a new console.\nIt doesn't seem to happen is you open a shell specifically, like when you open one in here:\n\nTo fix this, you can set a default task to be used instead.\nOpen the options, then click settings:\n\nThen got to tasks (Under Startup), select the task/shell you want as default, then click default task for new console.\n\nNow whenever you open a new console, it won't rerun the last task it did, like that pesky startup bat file that only needed to be used once. >.<\nNote, even though it won't open the .bat the dir will still be from where the bat last ran. The only way to change that is to add a dir you want it to open to be default with the Task parameters, like this:\n\nGiven the op considers the issues he was having resolved, this issue can probably be closed.. @Maximus5 That'll be because for what ever reason, it wasn't checking for updates. Not sure why, that's not something I'd turn off unless there was an issue with an update.\nFunny note, after the update was applied, it auto ran the startup .bat I have. So it ignores custom/changed settings. Doesn't seem to do it after that first run though.\nWith this I'd assume that the default settings are used on the very first run after an update/install, which would seem to indicate the changes above are still the correct way to override the defaults to get the desired results (a clean console when you start a new one). The method above seems to still be correct.\nAlso, it seems I still was using a more recent build than the current stable:\n\nI was going to change to the stable, but wasn't sure if I'd lose anything. I'm going to stick with the latest for now.. ",
    "DamnedScholar": "I'm on 161206 with a US keyboard. When I go to Settings -> Keys & Macro and type \"restart\" into the filter field, nothing comes up. When I hit Win-shift-`, it prints a ~ into my console. The link from that hotkey description pulls up a screenshot of Main -> Tab Bar, which doesn't contain anything about the hotkey, but did lead to me discovering that I can set it so that double-clicking on a tab will restart that tab. It's not a hotkey, but it does satisfy my need.. I checked again and that keybinding is unset for me.. ",

Removing the wsl from wsl\\conemu-cyg-64.exe and copying wsl\\cygwin1.dll to C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\ConEmu fixed the isse. Actually wsl\\conemu-cyg-64.exe does not exist, but whatever is called instead causes the error.... Thanks @Maximus5, I didn't notice the new entry after updating earlier.... 170807 fixes this partly. When I run the automatically generated {Bash::bash}\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt\n\n, the only weird thing is an AltGr-Deadkey-Tilde which my (customized) layout has (though IIRC the original Swiss-German layout also has this). Instead of the usual ~ followed by space, I now have to enter ~ twice. That's acceptable (and how often do I need to type a \u00f1 on WSL?) though confusing.\nWhat still doesn't work though is searching through history via arrow keys, which ~/.inputrc's\n## arrow up\n\"\\e[A\":history-search-backward\n## arrow down\n\"\\e[B\":history-search-forward\n\nshould achieve. But maybe that's a problem with some other config files...\nIf I instead use the Task\n\"C:\\Program Files\\ConEmu\\ConEmu\\conemu-cyg-64.exe\" \"/cygdrive/c/Program Files/ConEmu/ConEmu/wsl/wslbridge.exe\"\n\n(I thing the major difference is the lack of the :p console switch), the Deadkey-Tilde works fine, but the arrow keys don't.. For proper arrow function, p4 apparently must be inactive, i.e. instead of -cur_console:p I think -cur_console:p1 is the proper setting. Though at the moment I don't see any difference from omitting it. But apparently now the 256 colors don't work anymore despite the wslbridge task.\nAnd the tilde-deadkey still behaves wrong, and more confusingly this seems to depend on whether I used wslbridge or pure bash.exe first after a reboot... Just a note, I checked: The deadkey-tilde is also present in the native DE-CH keyboard layout, so anyone in Switzerland might encounter the same problem. Another AltGr-Deadkey is \u00b4, which also behaves weird. Sometimes it just works, sometimes it seems to cause a TAB to be passed, sometimes nothing happens. But maybe I should open a new issue for AltGr-Deadkeys, since the originally posted bug is fixed.... @techexo Thanks for reminding me to add that reboot information to #1224, so you also agree that depends on which task you started first after booting?.

Thank you for your help! Suddenly ConEmu started being very useful to me :)\nIt's not that obvious though. The documentation mentions that the 'host key' is configurable, but does not explain how to proceed exactly and the option named 'host key' is nowhere to be found. Other than that, I've noticed that after changing the key the option mentioned by me changed its name ('LCtrl' has been replaced by 'Win' in my case). This is kind of surprising, and seeing the option like 'LCtrl+Numbers - activate console' suggested that the only thing to do is to switch it on/off - that's why I was sure that the keys combination is not configurable.\nFor example of how confusing all of this is, one excerpt from the docs:\n'Note, Win is default \u2018Host key\u2019, keys combination is configurable.'\nand the word 'configurable' is a link that leads to... some screenshot of 'Main->Tab bar' configuration menu, which does not contain any option to configure this... FAQ didn't help much either.\nSo... maybe it is worth explaining this in the docs. There is a multitude of options. To you - the author of this (great!) software - these may be obvious. Not so for someone just getting accustomed to it.. Yes, that was the first place where I went. However, I've found that a lot of the hotkeys are non-editable there and a list with hotkeys is so long, so I went elsewhere...\nEven now I've another 'problem', also related to the vagueness of the descriptions. There is a hotkey described as\n'System - Ctrl+Tab - Next tab (may be disabled)'\nand it is non-editable, so... how can it be disabled? I'd like to assign another function to Ctrl+Tab but then ConEmu gives me a balloon warning about hotkeys conflict.\n... a software this good deserves not to die of being misunderstood :). Thanks again!\nAlso: you see? Hotkey change, and not a page with hotkeys! :)\nI'd be glad to proofread all the documentation, just not right now.

Perhaps replace \"RTFM\" with \"It looks like this problem might be caused by a misunderstanding of how ConEmu works; this page may help: \"+$link.\nThat sentence is generic enough that it could be used with pretty much any newbie question.\nIn this case, I had thought that ConEmu was taking control of the text selection process because PuTTY was acting differently when run from ConEmu, and thus the ChildGui page did not apply.  After a more-careful reading of that page, it became clear that yes, it always applies to PuTTY.\nAfter reading that, changing the settings in PuTTY fixed highlighting; but then restarting ConEmu broke the highlighting again.  The next hypothesis was that ConEmu was preventing PuTTY from loading or maybe saving its settings.  While typing that here, I realized that the PuTTY command line was not loading my settings because it only had user@hostname on the command line, not '-load xyz'.\nIn conclusion, troubleshooting is a journey from hypothesis to hypothesis, and documenting possible paths will shorten the trip.

I have to force ConEmu to close it. \n\n\nHelp?\n. OK I went with @Maximus5's linked solution. It works for me.\nAs a feature request it would be nice if this, or some other solution, worked out of the box. What I mean is I didn't have to do anything to get Git Bash to appear in my ConEmu tasks. I don't know how it got there. Couldn't ssh-agent also be there in the same way?\nCheers.\n. > ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {git bash}\nMore context please? If i run this command from either a ConEmu CMD prompt, or just a regular CMD after doing a cd into the ConEmu dir, I get a popup terminal with Git Bash starting then it exits with the same error message.\n\nConEmuC: Root process was alive less than 10 sec, ExitCode=0.\nPress Enter or Esc to close console.... Related?\n\nhttps://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1473#issuecomment-365056424. Thanks for the reply. My settings were identical to this screenshot.\nI have disabled \"Change prompt (cmd, powershell) text cursor position with Left Click\" and things are much better.\nMaybe the issue was \"3rd state\" while I was in a BASH shell, from inside a CMD shell, detecting ReadConsole? I have disabled this feature all together because I do not want my cursor to move at all, so all good now. \nRegards,. ",

    "nickjj": "I noticed this in day to day usage too.\nI replaced everything in that task box with bash.exe and I haven't gotten the problem since. On top of that, ConEmu spawns a new WSL bash terminal a lot faster now.. @Maximus5 I'm still getting this problem occasionally with 180111 [alpha] which was the latest as of 2 weeks ago (when you posted your reply).\nIt happens less often but it still happens a few times a day and I'm not sure if it's related to the arrow keys. All I know is, the entire terminal window stops accepting input and I have to close it. ConEmu is still responsive through out the process, it's just that single terminal window that locks up.. Yes. The same shell as before. WSL with bash, using your recommended predefined task which is: set \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt. That's the default task for {Bash::bash}.\nShould I be using a different task?. It looks like --wsl is already set, unless you want me to remove everything after that in the above command.\nFor the record arrow keys and everything works. It's just that periodically input completely stops.. It's also worth pointing out I'm not using cygwin. I know you probably know that (I'm using WSL), but putting it here so it's in the issue.\nIs using the cygwin binary some temporary work around for WSL until official support is added?. I'm using WSL and cygwin doesn't exist on my system, but the WSL terminal task calls out to conemu-cyg-64.exe, which to me sounds like something cygwin related is being ran.\nI would have expected to see a conemu-wsl-64.exe being ran for WSL.. Has there been any work towards this?. I like that idea @Maximus5.\nRight now those hotkey combos don't work with the current implementation (they result in no change of the selection).\nAt best you can currently do Shift+(Up / Down) arrows and this select lines about 100x faster than the mouse, but still takes a while if you want to select something like 150 lines of text.. Also in case anyone is wondering, Shift + Ctrl + Up / Down also works to select many lines of text once you've started your selection with the mouse.. I just wanted ConEmu to launch a bash prompt and correctly find the wslbridge using the /e mount path instead of /mnt/e. What would the correct syntax be for that?. Also I do think this is a ConEmu issue.\nBecause if I change my wsl.conf file to use the root = / path I can run ubuntu from Windows and use their terminal. Then my c and e drives are mounted at / successfully.\nBut with ConEmu I see:\n```\nwslbridge error: failed to start backend process\nnote: backend error output: /bin/bash: /mnt/e/apps/ConEmu/App/ConEmu/ConEmu/wsl/wslbridge-backend: No such file or directory\nConEmuC: Root process was alive less than 10 sec, ExitCode=0.\nPress Enter or Esc to close console...\n```\nThis is with using /cur_console:pm:\"\" or /cur_console:pm:/mnt.\nIt's like that bridge path is hard coded to always look in /mnt.. It looks like some work has been done to address this at https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge/issues/22.\nI don't know if it's in a release or how to use it tho.\nBy the way, other terminals such as wsltty work with custom WSL mount points using the latest wslbridge (from master).. Nice work!\nIt works great now while using /cur_console:pm:/mnt. But should I still switch that to \"\"? \nI also logged out of Windows completely to make sure my mounts were clear.\nHere's /etc/wsl.conf:\n[automount]\nroot = /\noptions = \"metadata,umask=0022\"\nAnd the output of running mount -l:\nC: on /c type drvfs (rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=22,metadata)\nD: on /d type drvfs (rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=22,metadata)\nE: on /e type drvfs (rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=22,metadata)\nAccessing /e produces my mounted drive's file system as expected.\nAccessing /mnt/e is an empty folder. Not sure if this is expected. I would have expected /mnt to be completely empty instead of listing each drive's folder with empty content.\nEdit: It's also worth pointing out that my .bashrc has no manual bind mounts happening, so this is definitely working well. Docker for Windows volume mounts also work out of the box.. Ok, thanks.\nSo for 100% clarity, I should do something like this if I wanted to goto my e drive by default:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -new_console:d:E:\\\nThat -new_console flag comes out when I choose the startup dir from your dialog box. But I completely removed the current console flag since it didn't seem to do anything with new console set?. @Biswa96 Certain apps don't respect symlinks.\nBefore this patch I just ran sudo mount --bind /mnt/c /c in my ~/.bashrc, but with the patched wslbridge and wsl.conf, it's a much cleaner solution.. I'll make a screencast the next time it happens but the effect is this:\n\nOpen ConEmu.\nPlace ConEmu in the middle of your desktop.\nClick your desktop background.\nClick the ConEmu titlebar.\n\nThen repeat steps 3 and 4 clicking between them as fast as humanly possible, then multiply that by about 1,000 and that's what's happening here automatically and unprovoked.. I never used the ChildGUI feature.\nBut I will say this...\nWhen you launch a PowerShell console through the dialog, it launches immediately.\nWhen you launch a PowerShell (admin) console through the dialog, it pops up the Windows prompt but then after you press OK a small window appears for a second and disappears before the PS admin console launches. Could this be part of the problem?\n\ncan you close ConEmu by cross click?\n\nYou mean pressing the X right? Yes, it's responsive and it's how I've been closing it.\n\ncan you open other window like TaskManager?\n\nYeah the system is still fully responsive. It's just ConEmu that's stuck in a focus/deactivate loop.. Just letting you know I haven't forgotten about this. I just enabled logging now and will post it up once it happens again.. It happened again and I caught it in the logs.\nContext:\nI was mouse wheel scrolling through some content, switched focus to my browser and then back to ConEum and it started flickering (but this exact workflow isn't repeatable to make it happen again).\n7:56:34.991 Wheel Dir:-120 LParam:{3589,607} Real:{3589,607}\n7:56:34.991 -- skipped (isInternalScroll)\n7:56:35.027 Wheel Dir:-120

Wheel events were not processed by ConEmu internal scrolling procedure.\nI just ran a CLI command's help menu and was scrolling through it.\n\nStrange one. Have you tried to activate ConEmu by clicking on the scrollbar?\n\nNever intentionally but I just tried that now and it doesn't cause the problem in a repeatable way.\n\nThat click represents client area. Were there two clicks or only one?\n\nI pasted exactly what was in the log, I must have clicked it twice but this also doesn't cause the problem in a repeatable way.\n\nSo the questions...\n\n\nNope I can't reproduce it.\nVagrant through a PowerShell Admin window (this bug never happens with WSL).\nIt depends. I usually activate on the title bar but sometimes I click directly into the terminal.\nNone, because a screenshot wouldn't show it. The entire terminal goes in and out of focus very quickly.. Here's a bit more data:\n\nI still can't reproduce this but it seems to happen more often when there's a lot of text in the buffer, or when a vertical scroll bar is present. Gaining focus of ConEmu by clicking in the middle of the terminal, title bar or where the scroll bar is has the same outcome.. They are at their default values.\nI tried enabling skip focus events but it still flickers.. When ConEmu blinks fast, no other windows or applications are affected. It's only ConEmu.\nI've rebooted before and I still get the blinking problem at least 15 times a day when working with PowerShell Admin through ConEmu.\nI've been using Windows since 1995 and I've never seen this happen with any other application btw, just saying. :D. I'm also able to reproduce it 100% of the time in a PowerShell Admin window that has been left open for over 24 hours, but I can't reproduce it on a fresh PowerShell Admin that I just opened.\nHere is a video (like yours, the blink speed is slowed down due to 30 FPS video):\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1bPStEHkBDuAwO86PFI_zlvLs8qDwnXy7\nBut the steps were:\n\nKeep a PowerShell Admin window open for a long time.\nClick into the window once.\nClick into the window a second time while it's already activated.\n\nThis triggered it blinking fast for about 5 full seconds until it went away on its own. This work flow worked 10 times in a row and then I recorded a video of it, and it happened twice in a row on video.. That option is in its default value. I really haven't changed much in terms of ConEmu settings. Just things related to the theme and fonts.. > I've asked you for screenshots immediately and only now you provided a link.\nIt's a link because it's an mp4 file and you can't embed videos into github comments. A screenshot wouldn't show anything because it's a static representation of a single point in time.\n\nAnd I see not a \"powershell prompt\" but ssh to remote machine with bash prompt.\n\nIf you look at the first line of the terminal in the video it shows a PS prompt. It also shows me SSHing into a vagrant box. You can also see it's in admin mode by looking at the title bar, because it says (Admin).\n\nThat (ssh/bash prompt) + option + click in certain area of the console may be the reason of (probably) expected behavior.\n\nI never changed that option and it only happens when I use PS Admin. Are you saying I should uncheck \"Change prompt (cmd, powershell) text cursor position with Left Click\"? It's not even clear what option you're pointing to because the page isn't long enough to jump to that ID.. - Checked: 10 times in a row, it flickers when I click into an active window (but only with a PS admin window that's been left open for a long time).\n- Unchecked: 10 times in a row, it did not flicker and acted normal.\nWhat's the pros and cons of disabling that option? Sounds like you get unexpected behavior with it enabled but only in certain circumstances.. What would the task look like?\nThis throws an error:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt -dir %CD%. How would you set things up to work described in the issue, or are you saying it's not possible?\nI added -dir %CD% as a task param as so -icon \"%ProgramW6432%\\WindowsApps\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_1604.2017.922.0_x64__79rhkp1fndgsc\\images\\icon.ico\" -dir %CD%\nAnd when I launch the terminal initially it goes to my Windows home dir (default), but if I move to let's say cd /e/src and then open a new horizontal pane it puts me into the Windows home dir instead of /e/src (expected). That is a WSL path.. What does that mean for resolving this issue in the end?\n-dir %CD% seems to ignore it and reverts back to the Windows home directory.. Thanks. It actually works by just changing your PS1. I didn't have to add -dir %CD%.. The docs mention 64bit exclusively but this problem happens on both 32bit and 64bit.\nTurning both of those options on helps a little but not much. It still uses around 15-20% instead of 30-35%.. Is there anything I can do in the settings to further reduce CPU usage? I don't really care what things look like, I just want to be able to open a lot of terminals without half of my CPU being used.. How do I launch that?\nOn Tue, Oct 16, 2018 at 8:18 AM Maximus5 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nTry to run ConEmu64.exe -basic {bash }.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1735#issuecomment-430215007,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAxoo1nhdRXq3tUkq4OVYiEidCU9Tu6Vks5ulc6KgaJpZM4XdaFk\n.\n.

    "lordjeb": "I would like to fix this bug and submit a PR. What I have found is that the call to KERNEL32!GetConsoleKeyboardLayoutNameW results in a call to KERNEL32!ConsoleCallServer which returns 0x80004001, which is a status not implemented error code. But then the function uses RtlNtStatusToDosError to try to convert error code to a DOS/Win32 code. There is not a mapping for that, so it returns ERROR_MR_MID_NOT_FOUND to ConEmu. (And prints some additional error output in a kernel debugger that is not mentioned in this issue currently.)\nSo ConEmu could key off that return code and never call the API again after it hits that. There are a handful of places where this function gets dynamically loaded and called, but the one that calls over and over is in IsKeyboardLayoutChanged in ConsoleMain.cpp.\nSo should I...\n(a) Change only the function IsKeyboardLayoutChanged, have it recognize the error code, set a static variable to not make the call any more.\n(b) Make a wrapper function for GetConsoleKeyboardLayoutName that can make it so none of the other places get called multiply as well. Change all the other locations to call this wrapper.\n(c) Other?. ",

(perhaps the comment is out of date, I notice a related commit)\nIn any case, here is my problem statement.\nI am using Conemu on an industrial scale, and I create a few windows, each containing up to 20 tabs.\nWhat options do I have to load an entire set of tabs (where each tab contains a shell) in the background in a conemu window?\nIn general, I would like to have the ability to attach shells to conemu instances (as new tabs) without the conemu window coming to the foreground. I am open to suggestions on how to achieve that (the conemuc command line seems to have a few additional options, but I have yet to play with those, and I sense the foregroundness being strong on that side as well...).. > Switch -min worked for the first instance for an obvious reason: minimize action was not passes to first instance from newly runned one.  \nI think the indended behaviour of combining those flags for the user it's clear: it should add a tab to a an existing conemu instance (when I have multiple instances this happens to be the last one that was opened), and minimise it if not already minimised.\nIs there some nasty coding required to achieve this?\n\nBy the way, why do you run tabs via -reuse switch?  \n\nThis is the problem statement:\nWhat options do I have to load an entire set of tabs (where each tab contains a shell) in the background in a conemu window?\nThe python script iterates a folder containing .sh files, and executes them one by one with the command above. The first file is executed without the \"-reuse\" switch, so as to create a new instance. Subsequent files are loaded with the -reuse switch so as to reuse said instance.\n\nHow do you run python scripts?  \n\nThrough windows ftype/assoc mechanism. These is my setup script:\n```console\nassoc .py=Python.File\nassoc .pyc=Python.CompiledFile\nassoc .pyo=Python.CompiledFile\nassoc .pyw=Python.NoConFile\nassoc .pyz=Python.ArchiveFile\nassoc .pyzw=Python.NoConArchiveFile\nftype Python.ArchiveFile=\"%%SXDEVICELIVE_ROOT%%\\PAR\\WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.2Qt5\\python-3.5.2.amd64\\python.exe\" \"%%L\" %%\nftype Python.CompiledFile=\"%%SXDEVICELIVE_ROOT%%\\PAR\\WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.2Qt5\\python-3.5.2.amd64\\python.exe\" \"%%L\" %%\nftype Python.File=\"%%SXDEVICELIVE_ROOT%%\\PAR\\WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.2Qt5\\python-3.5.2.amd64\\python.exe\" \"%%L\" %%\nftype Python.NoConArchiveFile=\"%%SXDEVICELIVE_ROOT%%\\PAR\\WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.2Qt5\\python-3.5.2.amd64\\pythonw.exe\" \"%%L\" %%\nftype Python.NoConFile=\"%%SXDEVICELIVE_ROOT%%\\PAR\\WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.2Qt5\\python-3.5.2.amd64\\pythonw.exe\" \"%%L\" %%*\n```\n\nWhy don't use -new_console instead?  \n\nWhat would the advantage be?\n. > Did you ignored new ConEmu build?\nIndeed, I'm running an old build. Assume you've fixed the -reuse bit in the last build. If yes, thanks for that.\n\nTo run set of tabs simultaneously you may use -runlist switch.\nhttp://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuArgs.html\n\nLooks good, thanks. I'll give that a shot\n\nThe -new_console would run tabs inside the same window where the script is running.\n\nBut I'm executing this from both windows explorer and also by just running the full path command with Windows+R (standard Windows Run dialog). So for that I believe I will have to hardcode a specific conemu title for -reuse in the ftype command.\nThe problem is that -reuse will not take into consideration the \"title\" flag. It will reuse whatever last instance had focus.\nSo I am looking at conemucexe? I can get the conemu window handle from the title with python and pass it as /ATTACH /GHWND=<ConEmuHwnd>\nAm I down the right path, or am I missing something more concise to achieve the same?\n. [I've edited the previous comment to remove references to -title alongside -reuse. Currently, when you do -reuse you have no control on what window to reuse. It will be the last one that had focus on - and we agree that the title flag is ignored.]\nNow, how do I reuse a specific conemu windows, in the case when I have multiple ones open, and I do not want to reuse the last one, but a specific one (e.g. as identified by the title, or pid).\n.

I can't imagine the program is doing different things, yet running different shells displays different results. Also worth mentioning, when I run zsh from an admin cmd, I see escape codes again.. \nBy cmd32 I mean cmd-32. Ran regularly means \"not ran as admin\". Run zsh from an admin cmd means I ran cmd as admin and I typed in \"zsh\" and pressed enter.\nI have already said that my prompt is colored so the problem isn't as simple as that. The problem is that running a program (stack in this case) sometimes shows colored output, and sometimes it shows me escape codes, depending on which shell is ran.\nI'm sure you can appreciate the frustration of updating my terminal emulator, having something that previously worked break and then being told it's an issue with a program that hasn't changed at all and worked fine before the update.

The docs for getting 256 colors working with wsl (https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html) don't mention this nor the fact that latest builds already have the bridge set up by default. Lost a lot of time doing needless, redundant setup, then when I discovered it's already supposed to work out of the box, I lost even more time not knowing about this issue. I imagine I'm not the only one.. ",

    "zakius": "from what I've tried till now I can say:\nnotepad seems to work completely fine\nnotepad++ won't attach on start, manually attached works fine\nrambox won't attach on start, manually attached seems to work fine\nfranz attached on start while conemu is ran on startup bugs out, franz attached on conemu startup later on sometimes works fine, franz attached manually works fine\nnote: reproduction rate in some edge cases isn't 100% so \"seems to work fine\" can't be treated as guarantee\nthese little experiments shown that GUI attaching is inconsistent even in the scope of the same executable (though it's possible that rambox and notepad++ do something before launching main window leading to failed attachment)\nthere is possibly something to figure out about that, though I understand it's really unusual use case and short tests failed to find other GUI apps showing the same behavior\nI'll play with it a bit more and let you know if I find anything else. I reported ctrl+tab not working outside of conemu when conemu with child GUI is running appearing inconsistently (manual attaching never caused problem, closing and reopening conemu with the same startup task often causes the problem to not appear again or appear only after some time and other weird things like that).

Correct, but I didn't see a new connector release with that code change.\nAlso, still useful information for anyone who wants to run a different shell, since wslbridge doesn't respect the user's default shell.\nAlso, since the connector now explicitly sets the command to execute, when wslbridge does get around to natively support login shell or user's default shell, this change will have to be undone.. I'm running the preview channel.. Wondering what is the \"better\" way to use WSL: through wslbridge or simply invoking wsl.exe -new_console:pm:/mnt [{guid}] which seems to work out of the box?

It does support it in the 0.24 version of wslbridge\nAfter some some trial and error, I did finally figure it out. The trick was to add a - after the --wsl flag.\nFor anyone searching, I managed to get a Login shell through wslbridge, using a specific distribution.\nHere is the full command line I used:\n%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-msys2-64.exe --wsl -cur_console:pm:/mnt - -t --distro-guid {0302fe33-e328-413d-8520-077ab52d55ad} -- /bin/bash -i -l.

I've adjusted the task for {Shells::cmd} to\ncmd.exe /k \"%ConEmuBaseDir%\\CmdInit.cmd -git\"\n...and that switch in turn causes CmdInit.cmd to execute\nGitShowBranch /i\nBut this doesn't actually cause any git prompt to appear. After navigating to a git repo the prompt remains unchanged. You have to manually enter 'GitShowBranch' on the command line to cause the prompt to appear.\nIf you then make a change in that repo, add a file or edit something, the prompt still doesn't update automatically, you have to enter GitShowBranch again to update it. You have to run GitShowBranch everytime you do anything that modifies the repo for the git prompt to be updated. Which isn't very useful.\nLooking through GitShowBranch it's mostly simple stuff. When GitShowBranch is called with /i the prompt is modified to include $E]9;8;\"gitbranch\" which I believe causes ConEmu to insert the value of the 'gitbranch' environment variable into the prompt.\nWhen GitShowBranch is subsequently called without /i it calls 'git status' and creates a value for 'gitbranch' based on the number of file changes. But there is nothing obvious in the script that would cause this to happen automatically.\nAlthough in the statement to set the prompt there is one thing I don't understand which is the $E]9;7;\"cmd -cur_console:R /c%~nx0\" \nOf this the documentation says \"R - force start hooks server in the parent process\". But I already have \"Inject ConEmuHk\" checked in the ConEmu settings and have no idea why this would be being called from inside the statement that sets the prompt. \nSo at the moment even after adding the /git switch to the task startup the prompt is only ever updated when you manually call GitShowBranch on the commandline, and I'm looking for a way to make that happen automatically whenever I enter any command.\n. I'll start by saying I've got it working. What I had done was make a copy of CmdInit.cmd called MyCmdInit.cmd, and a copy of GitShowBranch.cmd called MyGitShowBranch.cmd and in MyCmdInit.cmd I'd replaced the call to \"GitShowBranch /i\" with \"MyGitShowBranch.cmd /i\". What I wanted to do was modify GitShowBranch to enhance the prompt to indicate upstream changes and stuff.\nBut without modifying a single line in MyGitShowBranch that doesn't work. I don't see why. Is ConEmu's use of GitShowBranch hardcoded so renaming it breaks the updating? If so, not a problem, I'll just make a backup and modify the original.\n\n. Adding 'cmd -cur_console:R /cMyGitShowBranch.cmd' to the list of allowable commands enabled me to get a copy of GitShowBranch.cmd working.\nThe build I have is published as the latest stable build, I only downloaded it on Friday, but I'll update to preview as you recommend.\nThanks for the help..

I believe using the bash.exe directly does not use the connector.\nFor example, you say you have for your task {Bash::bash}:\n%windir%\\system32\\bash.exe -cur_console:pm:/mnt --login -i -new_console\nI, personally, replaced everything in my {Bash::bash} task with the following:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --log --wsl -cur_console:pnm:/mnt -t bash -l\nI believe this does use the connector and is how I'm now using the bash terminal on windows.\nSpecifically, I'm no longer connecting directly to the bash.exe.\nIf there is no reason to not use the connector, I would say just replace your bash task with the custom task commands and run that way instead of the default \\bash.exe way.. @rymanske check if you experience same lag in regular, non-ConEmu bash.exe as @ltomes mentions.\nI went through the pain of diagnosing the \"prompt lag\", that I believe @ltomes is describing.\nHowever, it sounds like this might not be the same issue your having... could you elaborate on what \"keyboard input lag\" looks like for you?\nThe issue with the prompt is very noticeable each time the prompt loads for a new line, might take .5 - 2 seconds to load the prompt (even when simply via <Ctrl-C>).\nIf instead your actual keystoke inputs are delayed, i.e. you type key, wait, and then finally letter appears, this I am unfamiliar with and have not experienced..

Yes that is correct, black to black, but that is what is printed, maybe it's not what actually cmd got. After some investigation, I can see that the whole problematic output comes out from Gradle automation tool build with Java. \nIf you look at these screenshots, you'll that there is some text:\n\n\nTry:\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.\n\n\n\nwhich all the text is hidden, but only the arguments (--stacktrace, --info, --debug) are visible:\n\nand if you go at BuildExceptionReporter.java:191 on Github, you'll see that there is a style option UserInput for the arguments and the rest of the text is handled just with a text function for Normal text output.\nThat makes me think that maybe there is an issue with how Gradle handles the ANSI text formating and maybe there is a bug, but again I am not so sure since it outputs as normal in Windows cmd console and even in ConEmu when not using the ConEmuHk injection.. What is exactly that you don't understand? Please read again this comment above, that has even a screenshot inside that shows how ConEmu displays the output when I have the ConEmuHk injection disabled. It displays everything normal like Windows cmd does.\nI don't have any more time to investigate this. If you think this is not a ConEmu bug, then we just close it and continue. My problem is solved by disabling ConEmuHk feature, I am not really sure what extra features I'll miss by disabling that though.. No I do not agree that this code is produced by react-native. That is something you are saying. If it does then why it displays fine in the Windows cmd console? And even in ConEmu without the Hk injection? If react-native would print black text on black background, then it would display the text line like that in Windows cmd console even. Can you understand that? Do you understand that this is working as expected when I disable that Hk feature in ConEmu settings? Thanks for your time though, I just wanted to help.\nEDIT\nYou are acting like Facebook's react-native is a script that some guy wrote and executes some commands. If you check it here https://github.com/facebook/react-native, you will realize that it is very popular with 56,000 stars and 13,000 forks. Do you really believe that a project so popular like that with Facebook developers behind it would have such silly bugs when using it's main functionality, to build the Android application? I will try and report a bug there when I find some time. You know maybe there is no issue with react-native neither with ConEmu, but that requires some investigation.. I am still waiting you to answer my questions.\nWhen the cmd.exe prints, doesn't it get ANSI code sequences? Why does it print without a problem?\nWhen ConEmu prints without the Hk injection, doesn't it use ANSI code sequences? Why does it print without any issues?\nHere we have a behavior that DOES NOT occur when a specific feature turns OFF, and that is ConEmuHk injection. Why do you insist to ignore that fact?\nSo, here are the ANSI codes with the Hk injection disabled: https://gist.github.com/clytras/84419fb838c0b6e4824163a5f9788637\nAs you can see, there is 37 Foreground and 40 for Background colors which is white text on black background. How do you explain that? If you insist that this is what ConEmu gets from react-native, then why does ConEmu gets some properly escapes ANSI sequences when it has that feature disabled?\n. Which questions exactly I ignore of yours? Check all the above replies and you'll find your answers.\n\nWho prints ANSI codes? Don't you think it's the ConEmu?\n\nOf course react-native does. Not even I told you that, but I found the very source code that does that and through what library, check the above comment here. I told you there that react-native uses the Gradle automation library and here at BuildExceptionReporter.java line 191 you will see the example that I described. \n\nThese ANSI codes tells ConEmu to use black on black. Aren't they?\n\nOnce again I will tell you that this is not true, because if that would be true, then that would be the case even for cmd Windows and ConEmu with Hk injection. How many times do I have to write that thing? How many?\n\nWhy do you think it does? Did you check that? Did you seen them? Again. The application may use WinAPI instead of ANSI. Only authors or debugger may say what happens there.\n\nYes I can see them, because I am a developer with plenty of knowledge an I found the way that react-native outputs the commands. I told you where to look even. Go check at the Gradle project and you'll see for yourself. It does not uses WinAPI, you can see that if you check that library and EVEN if it does, how do you think WinAPI SetConsoleTextAttribute does print the console attributes? If you guess by ANSI sequences, you will guess right.\n\nWhat? Where did you take these ANSI codes??? If you disable ConEmuHk, you ConEmu ANSI logging is not working. Sorry, but your assertions doesn't look reliable.\nIf you see these codes in the console you can't insist that there are no issues.\n\nYou don't believe me now? Where did I get the correct ANSI sequences (???), from ConEmu of course. menu Edit > ANSI sequences checked and the menu Edit > Copy All and paste to a gist. This is a copy of ConEmu ANSI sequences. You insist that ConEmu has no issue here when you can see that it gets correct ANSI sequences without that Hk feature... How do you explain that? I am still waiting for an answer other than \"only the developers know how they echo by WinAPI or ANSI sequences\" which is a same thing done with 2 different methods.\n\nDo you insist that ConEmu CHANGES the data console application prints? Do you really believe I specially make you life harder by changing correct 37 to wrong 30?

    "AjawadMahmoud": "Hi, @Maximus5. I started using ConEmu just two days ago, and i'm already finding it the best console i needed forever. yet, the paste thing is getting me to shift to other consoles in between when i need to paste long texts. in my case, what's more than slow is that it skips some random chars. everytime i paste something (long, multiline) i get different results. I'm on windows 10 and using ConEmu as bash console.. @Maximus5, the purpose varies. Mostly it's quick debugging some piece of code out of its original scope where I copy a whole block of python code and paste in python interpreter to do some testing on it. Yet, I'm having issues with even single line paste, it does skip some chars in between. If you are not getting the same behaviour at your end I can take a video and show you unless your logs have something like that copied inside.. Okay, today I updated to the last version 180131 [x64] and I lost the nice proper pasting feature that worked as expected by the OP.\nNot sure what have you changed to get this feature undone. from the previous build.. Sorry for the fuzzy comment.\nI use chocolaty as my go-to package manager on Windows. So, I disable your builtin version checker. Last week ConEmu was updated (again, using choco update all) and the paste behaviour was correctted. I could paste long strings, singleline and multlines ones without issues. Today, ConEmu was updated again be the choco and the paste behaviour was revered to the previous behaviour where it would paste only few chars from the whole string whether it was single or multline.\n[UPDATE]: I checked choco logs and found the previous version was 18.1.30.0 and even with reinstalling it I still have had lost the expected behaviour.. I reporting about the same behaviour of slow pasting here. During the last week ConEmu was working as expected. Today, after the update it reveresd the behaviour to the previous unacceptable behaviour.. @Maximus5, I hope you are not bothered by my comments. I really appreciate your great efforts here. And, I assure you your creation is way more better than any other implementation out there.\nToday, I found a completely different and weird behaviour. I wrongly opened ConEmu from the desktop shortcut which was created by yesterday's update process. It opened Windows cmd shell instead of bash naturally, where I typed bash to get there. I then pasted some copied text for the sake of testing, and, Boom! It worked as expected! I could see the whole line pasted correctly:\nhttps://prnt.sc/i9uqcb\nSo, I repeated the test, but, this time using my taskbar shortcut which is having bash as a parameter after the shortcut address. And, happened what happened:\nhttp://prntscr.com/i9urfx\nThis is really really really weird behaviour. Any idea? I also tried to set bash as the default shell for startup but that didn't work, I was always greeted with cmd shell instead.. Hmm.. So, you can't suggest a workaround to run bash on cmd as bash shell instead of the current implementation? I'm asking though as you really can't expect Microsoft to work on this when it's actually not their project in any form, and while they are pushing everyone to use Powershell.\n[UPDATE]: after switch-teseting few times between having bash added as a parameter or not to ConEmu, I ended up with the correct behaviour with bash present as a parameter. I guess this is exactly what you meant when you mentioned the race condition that SOMETIMES don't work. is there any log file that I can provide you to help you with this, or you don't consider this issue as solvable?. Coo. apologies.. ",
    "raztus": "Here is my use case: vim. I often run vim through ConEmu, and want to paste a large snippet. I am ignorant to what actually happens when I paste into a terminal, but I have always been confused that I have to wait for text to slowly appear line by line in vim in ConEmu while in other terminal emulators (mintty on Windows, xfce4-terminal on Linux) it is near-instant.\nAs an example, copying all the text from this page (ctrl+a), roughly 10734 characters and 250 lines, then pasting into vim 8.0.237:\n- ConEmu 180206: 6 seconds\n- cmd.exe: 2 seconds\n- mintty: 0.5 seconds\nRough, non-scientific counting based on the time I click paste (or \"Ok to prompt in ConEmu\") to the time the terminal window stops scrolling.\nAnother use case which is more of a visual annoyance than a hindrance: pasting a 180 char command (often I have a curl command which exceeds this) in ConEmu seems to take roughly 1/2 second, and the cursor can be observed skipping across the line. In Cmder, one can press ctrl+shift+v to have the same 180 chars appear instantly (perhaps this is the \"WinAPI message\" you mentioned earlier @Maximus5?). ",

Experiment:\nI create a weird display (as above), copy this row to the clipboard, and enter it into Notepad.  You were correct: the same distinction between fonts shows in Notepad as well.  Likewise in Wordpad (which uses a different graphic APIs than Notepad).\nSo this is not ConEmu\u2019s fault: I just never had chance to see how brain-damaged implementations of Backspace interacts  with font display..

I encountered a similar problem, in which case a special unicode character is missing in the font I set in conemu. keep in mind some programs will simple use system's fallback font for missing glyphs. so even if you use the same font for conemu and other programs (e.g. browser or notepad), the behavior might be different.\ncheck your font to find out whether it misses the glyphs you need. or try fonts with better unicode support like dejavu family.\n. as I said, programs like notepad have a fallback mechanism for missing glyphs in fonts. actually most programs will use a fallback font provided by the operating system if you use standard Windows widgets (or as also called controls).\nbut if a program is drawing glyphs on its own, like conemu or games, the operating system will not help you choose a fallback font when some glyphs are missing.\nso, notepad will always display the character, as long there is a font installed in your system that supports that specific character. encoding is another orthognal issue, though.\nthe \"\u25a3\" character you metioned renders fine on my machine in conemu, so I am faily certain it's a font issue. and I'm kind of certain that lucida is very old and doesn't have good unicode support.\nsimple solution: install the dejavu font family, which has a very good reputation regarding unicode support, and then change your conemu settings. if you need CJK fonts (like me), \"source han sans\" is a good choice\nif you are curious enough, you may try to examine the problematic font file using font editing tools, like fontforge.\nor, you can also try the font in programs which are rendering fonts themselves (don't use Windows programs like notepad). as far as I know, on windows, emacs and gvim are such programs. but there are caveats:\n  * gvim only support monospaced fonts\n  * emacs has its own fonts fallback mechanism (which is different from the operating system), but you can always use the describe-char command. just FYI, the font I'am using is https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic\nits a source han sans derivation,\nit looks like this\n\n. wsl on my machine runs just fine.

Dunno what Maximus5 is linking to but I verified that the mintty update has fixed the issue. Thanks, zhuban!. Maximus5, I don't think users will know that 'copying text doesn't work' will be fixed by clicking the set focus option buried deep in a settings dialog. They would expect it to just work out of the box like it always has done with cygwin+conemu.\nIn any case, it's fixed by the mintty workaround for conemu.. Yes i see the docs but I didn't even know 'ChildGui' was a thing. Users just want to be able to use ConEmu as a terminal for cygwin use and have it function.  I don't know what 'console analogues are preferable' means. . If you want folks to read your tips in the docs, I'd suggest having a section in the docs entitled 'Using ConEmu with Cygwin' with a walkthrough of your suggested best practices for using conemu + cygwin. Looks like you're recommending to run a shell with just 'bash.exe' rather than 'mintty.exe' ? \nYou have  headings entitled 'Delusions' and 'ChildGui' currently, but i dont think most users are going to click into / read those / know what they mean unless they are just clicking randomly through the documentation, or searching for something..

ConEmu can be used with many shells like Far or cmd or sh, etc, and none of those needs to wait for all the child processes.\nJust make an option: \"wait for child processes to exit\". Simple..

The behavior of ConEmu not closing the window as long as there is any background child process running is really very, very pesky.\nAnd one more problem. I start a few child processes from a ConEmu session, running as GUI apps so they don't block the console. Then I start a long batch operation which blocks the console, and decide to terminate it using Ctrl+C. And then, ConEmu terminates all the child processes, including those that are completely unrelated to the batch operation currently running. This is not what was expected.. @Maximus5 \n\nConEmu does not terminate anything by Ctrl+C.\nGUI applications are not attached into ConEmu console automatically, unless they do that themselves.\nCtrl+C is a feature of OS, sort of signals in Unix. It's absolutely on your applications what they do when signal is received. And of course, the signal comes only into applications attached to that console.\n\n\nHmmm, I'm getting the same behavior in the Windows command line. It seems that it's unrelated to ConEmu.. ",

For anyone else simply looking for a Linux shell experience on Windows with WSL and was hoping to use ConEmu + WSL, I found an alternative solution that works well for me. I had given up on ConEmu due to this issue (sorry, @Maximus5 , but I do thank you for all of your work on this project.. I used it for a few years).\nYou may want to check out X410 in the Microsoft Store. It's usually $10 (and almost always \"on sale\"). You can use a native Linux terminal like Tilix or GNOME terminal with WSL. Just make sure to follow their tutorials on their website for setup (including running sudo commands as yourself, not as root). I'm not affiliated or anything - just another person looking for a Linux shell experience on Windows with WSL..

Thank you. Replacing the \"Win+W\" key doesn't get me what I'm looking for because it only creates new tabs, not new windows - sometimes I want to create new windows.\nI got rid of the previous Ctrl+Shift+T/N keybinds and tried doing macros. It works for new tab, but new window (Ctrl+Shift+N) still prompts me for confirmation. Any ideas?\nSorry for being so troubling as I'm sure I'm just doing something wrong here...\n\n\n. @Maximus5 @Marco94 \nThis appears to be correct. I'm not sure I completely understand how this is related. Maybe the wording can be adjusted or this can be broken out to a separate option?

I'm using the Windows Subsystem for Linux: an Ubuntu / Bash shell built into Windows which allows you to run Linux tools natively. Once it's installed, you can run \"bash\" in Windows and it opens this shell (or you can find \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\" in the start menu).\nUsually I run this inside Cmder, and it used to work fine. However, late last year pasting stopped working.  Cmder have an open issue about this that is marked as being a problem with ConEmu, and that seems to be the case (I tried running ConEmu on its own, and  also ran into this issue).\nHope that helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can tell you.. @BenChirlin Sounds like you've fixed it, but for the record I've also had no problem with pasting lately, and I think it might also have been updating to the preview version that fixed it (in Cmder's settings: Main --> Update --> Preferred release type --> Preview). ",
    "BenChirlin": "Is there a solve for this? Do I really have to install this \"connector\" as per instructions here and here? That seems like a lot of extra dependencies and things I don't understand just to get copy paste working normally. I too am getting characters dropped if I try to paste anything more than a single uninterrupted string (spaces and slashes seems to start getting pruned randomly).\nHelp or alternatives would be greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: Never mind! I don't know what part of what I did fixed this exactly but I updated to the ConEmu Alpha (180318), updated my tasks, and then reset my startup task to bash after trying git:bash for a bit. I think the task reset/update did it! Thanks.. ",

It's not so much based on elevated or not elevated but I have a number of powershell shells open on different tabs with different names and I like to set the color palette to give me a visual identity of the shell I'm on. When all the powershell shells look the same occasionally I enter a command on the wrong tab.\nI was using elevated and non-elevated before because it was the only way I could distinguish the tabs.

    "JonathanHolvey": "Thanks for your reply. I looked through my settings and the Read line enhancements Ctrl+Backspace option is already checked. I tried disabling and re-enabling it, but that didn't help.\nHere is a dump of my settings file: https://pastebin.com/AhrtnkFh. Today I downloaded the latest preview build, 180506, however I still can't get it working as expected.\nMy usual configuration modified to run conemu-msys2-64.exe instead of bash (and some additions to .inputrc) works with everything except Ctrl+Backspace, which deletes only a single character.\nWhat's the minimum required setup to get this working? I tried deleting my entire config and only setting up the following:\n\nA single, default task that runs conemu-msys2-64.exe\nEnabling Ctrl+Backspace under keyboard settings\n.inputrc as per the above link\n\nThis gives me the same broken behaviour as my original post.. I don't think it's an inputrc problem. Using versions 161206 and 180506 for comparison, Ctrl+Backspace works in Bash in version 161206 after enabling read line enhancements, whereas in version 180506 it does not. All other settings are defaults.\nWhat do you think has changed?\nI don't have showkeys, but using Ctrl+V in Bash outputs ^? in version 180506, but does nothing in version 161206. I assume that the read line enhancements setting causes ConEmu to hijack the Ctrl+Backspace keypress, and for some reason, this is not working with Bash in later versions (it is still effective with cmd).. KeyEvents outputs the following for Ctrl+Backspace in both versions of ConEmu (161206 and 180506):\n18:52:23 KEY_EVENT_RECORD: Dn, 1, Vk=\"VK_CONTROL\" [17/0x0011], Scan=0x001D uChar=[U=' ' (0x0000): A=' ' (0x00)]\n         Ctrl=0x00000028 (Casac - ecNs) (Windowed)\n18:52:23 KEY_EVENT_RECORD: Dn, 1, Vk=\"VK_BACK\" [8/0x0008], Scan=0x000E uChar=[U=' (0x0008): A=' (0x08)]\n         Ctrl=0x00000000 (casac - ecns) (Windowed)\n18:52:23 KEY_EVENT_RECORD: Up, 1, Vk=\"VK_CONTROL\" [17/0x0011], Scan=0x001D uChar=[U=' ' (0x0000): A=' ' (0x00)]\n         Ctrl=0x00000020 (casac - ecNs) (Windowed). Thanks for the pointer to the pre-compiled key-reader binaries.\nIn ConEmu 161206 and 180506 I get <x7F> for both Backspace and Ctrl+Backspace.\nConEmu with conemu-msys2-64.exe gives <x7F> and <x1F>, however normal backspace and arrow keys don't work, as per my original post.\nIt seems there are two issues here:\n1. The change of behaviour between 161206 and 180506 with Ctrl+Backspace in Bash\n2. Arrow and backspace keys not working with the MSYS2 connector. ",

For example 80x25.\nIf I change the font size, then I would expect the size of the window to change to to maintain a fixed number of rows and columns.\nThis is not the same as the existing fixed console size in terms of cells option.

I can paste thousands of characters just fine as long as there's no space - but pasting 1 2 doesn't work :joy:\nFurther information:\n\nRunning wsl.exe directly (WIN+R) works fine\ncmd.exe via ConEmu also works fine\nRunning wsl.exe after starting cmd.exe via ConEmu also works\n\nIt only happens when running WSL directly through ConEmu.. Well, up until 1803 there was no problem with it. All I/O worked just fine. The default {bash} task wouldn't do for me because, well, I don't use bash. I use ZSH and I'm guessing most of us who've replaced the default task with a direct call to WSL did it for that reason. bash.exe loads just that: bash. wsl.exe loads the way you'd expect a terminal emulator to load on any UNIX system, namely that it loads whatever shell you've set for your user account.\nBy clicking through the docs a bit I've now figured out that we can actually use ZSH through the bridge as well, by use of the -t flag on the CygWin/MSYS connector.\nYou may want to update the FAQ for Bash on Windows by mentioning that one can control which shell is loaded through that flag, because it's not exactly clear. You have to go into the connector docs to find that out. That should help with the repeated queries about this.. Looks like the next version of wslbridge will do this correctly and not force bash by default. At which point I'd suggest your connector to also no longer default to -t bash.. Be that as it may, for the past 6-7 months or so  (that's when I switched back to Windows from my Mac) I've been using ConEmu with it set up to launch wsl.exe (so not bash.exe) directly and I haven't experienced any lost characters in pastes or anything. I'm sure some things wouldn't have worked that I simply haven't tried, but pasting wasn't one of them. The only \"issue\" I had with pasting was that newlines would be duplicated, but that's hardly a problem.\nPerhaps something changed shortly after the mentioned issue's date and I stepped in at just the right time? I don't know what else would explain it.\nAt any rate, you're right, the default task does let me paste as normal now, so for the time being I'll run it with -t zsh -l. With version 0.2.5 of wslbridge it'll get rid of the bash default though and I think you should then follow their lead and either change the default bash task to leave it up to WSL or perhaps add a new default task {wsl}?\nBut that's food for another day (and GH PR/issue) when 0.2.5 is out :P\nAnd just for reference for everyone else: this is how I'm starting my shell now, which is with zsh rather than bash:\nset \"PATH=%ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\wsl;%PATH%\" & %ConEmuBaseDirShort%\\conemu-cyg-64.exe --wsl -t zsh -l\nIt's ever so slightly modified from the default, barely any difference..

Are scrolling consoles/xterms passe?\nCompletely no disrespect intended, seriously.  ConEmu is an essential at this point; completely indispensable.\nTo enable xterm-256 color mode, we have to disable scrolling completely.   I find the lack of a scroll buffer pretty inconvenient.  Again, I  could be misinterpreting things here, but - a 256-color capability that disallows scrolling implies memory concerns, is this wrong?  I thought that plentiful, relatively dirt-cheap memory had mostly eliminated such restrictions.  I'd be willing to trade some memory for real color AND scrolling.  Again - not in any way meaning disrespect - but even several versions back, Windows' CMD has provided a configurable buffer for scrolling - a way to control the memory footprint a CMD profile/shortcut consumes.  \nAs currently implemented, xterm-256 and scrolling is not an option, and for me, scrolling wins.  I'm probably missing something, so I'll blame it on the lengthy hospitalization I've just returned from.\nThanks for your patience and - regardless of the questions I raise, that doc really is still referring to the deprecated \"Extend Foreground colors\" feature.\nS Francis.

    "chris-downs": "I can repro this on ConEmu v180626 preview running on Windows 10 Pro Insider Build 18252. I have oh-my-zsh installed and am using the 'pygmalion' theme that comes with it. Everything works fine with zsh standalone, but when it is run inside of tmux the cursor ends up a line above the prompt as pictured. \n\nThe $PS1 for the prompt is:\n%{$fg[magenta]%}%n%{$reset_color%}%{$fg[cyan]%}@%{$reset_color%}%{$fg[yellow]%}%m%{$reset_color%}%{$fg[red]%}:%{$reset_color%}%{$fg[cyan]%}%0~%{$reset_color%}%{$fg[red]%}|%{$reset_color%}%{$fg[cyan]%}\u21d2%{$reset_color%}\nThis does not repro on cmd.exe WSL.. Interestingly, I just noticed that if I do an ls the issue is fixed permanently in the current tmux window (i can exit zsh and come back and its still good, only broken again inside of a new window). I'm guessing the issue lies somewhere in color escaping and resetting, as ls uses colors. . @zadjii-msft has this fix been integrated? I'm running into it when running zsh with a multiline prompt inside of tmux on Pro Insider Version 10.0.18252 Build 18252.\n. Apologies, I didn't mention that this is happening in ConEmu (v180626 preview) (I ended up here from #1609). I tested from cmd.exe and everything works properly. @Maximus5 are you able to repro? Let me know if you need anything. . #1609 seems like a better place to continue discussion on this, ill move there. . ",
    "bg": "I'm an old-timer still using screen instead of tmux (on a linux box, ssh'd there from a conemu cmd.exe shell). The same bug exists there. If I PgUp and PgDn in irssi, then the cursor is left on the last line updated in the channel window, and not positioned back down on the command line where it belongs. Downgrading to the version before 180617 (i.e. choco install conemu --allow-downgrade --version 18.5.6.0) works around the issue.\nPrior to this, I noticed an even simpler failure mode in ruby which I distilled down to a minimal failing case, though I'm unsure if it's the same bug. In 180626, this fails in a git-bash shell:\n$ ruby -e \"gets\"\nRather than accepting a line of input and exiting, ruby hangs until I bail with ctrl-C. In 18.5.6.0, the above succeeds, and since it's messing up some of my ruby code, I'm going to just stick with that until both issues are resolved.\nPlease let me know if you think they're unrelated & I'll file this one separately.\n. Sorry I overlooked the unanswered request for logs. On the latest version I haven't noticed issues yet but in the interim have finally switched fully from screen to tmux so my current usage isn't exactly as before. I believe it is resolved, though. I'll make a point of re-executing that ruby simple reproducer, though and let you know (along with version details). I intend to do this by end of day tomorrow, if not sooner. . My \"ruby -e gets\" test works as expected now, both from cmd.exe & git bash. Pg-up & Pg-dn when ssh'd to another system from git-bash & connected to my tmux session there seems to behave correctly too.\nWindows 10 x64\nConEmu: 19.1.8.0 & 19.3.1.0\nGit for Windows: 2.19.2\nI didn't bother with collecting logs & screenshots since everything seems fine now.

I just rebooted, and after reboot memory usage is at ~7.5 GB and ConEmu FPS is ~45 and RPS is 70+.. I am on 180626, after 4 days of uptime perf looks good so far. RPS 90+, FPS ~50. Have to reboot though, so it'll take some time to validate on longer uptimes.\nThanks for the fix.. Still works fine after 8 days of uptime. RPS still 90+, FPS dropped to ~40, but still OK.

Seems odd that the two different styles of writing \"\\b \\b\" would affect anything, but I know we did tangentially touch the code responsible for that handling this release so I'll take a look..

I'm sending out a PR to fix this now, should be fixed soon enough, and out to insiders a few weeks after that.\nThanks everyone! Especially @Maximus5 for giving me a really easy unit test :). I believe it should be. @dhowett-msft, can you check if this repros?. @chris-downs Dustin and I just played with this a bunch in his office and we couldn't get anything like it to repro. Could you file a new issue with repro steps in Microsoft/Console?. Without investigating deeper, I'd presume that this is Microsoft/console#270. Does this repro on an Insider's build of Windows? This feels really similar to something that I fixed right after 17763 was released. If it does repro, I'll be happy to dive in deeper.\n. > it requires a single undocumented but exported function\nIf it's not documented, don't take a dependency on it. We no make guarantee that an implementation detail will continue to work in the future.\nFurthermore, conhost.exe is the host for all conpty sessions. If anyone's using the conpty API's, then hooking all conhost.exe launches would mean that a ConEmu would get launched even for conpty sessions, which is probably NOT what you want to have happen. \nI can share that setting a default terminal application is a pain point that we're aware of and investigating a official, supported solution. .

My apologies for assuming a level of knowledge on your part which apparently does not exist.\nThe version # I have -- which I saw billed as \"stable\" -- is 161206. The problem exists with that build.\nIn the interest of getting past the knee-jerk attempt to ignore user feedback, I just now downloaded and installed the \"latest\" version -- 180626, in case you don't have your release log handy -- and installed that.\nYou may be pleased to learn that the issue I was writing about -- in a two year old release -- is still present in the brand spanking new latest and greatest version. Setting ConEmu to force taking over consoles prevents Visual Studio 2017 from attaching to the Azure Function host process and debugging it. Turning off that option, and having VS 2017 revert to using plain old console windows allows debugging to proceed normally.\nI'd call that pretty definitive evidence there's still a problem in ConEmu. Your mileage, no doubt, will be different.\nHave a nice day!\n\nMark. Here are the logs that got generated when I had ConEmu take over the Windows console subsystem. I'm not sure why there are three log files. Two ConEmu windows were open, one created by VS 2017 when it launched its local Azure Function host, and one that I launched manually to run ngrok, so that calls to a Twilio webhook got passed to the Azure Function I was debugging.

    "cspotcode": "I believe that these issues are caused by the way ConEmu sends bytes to the target executable's stdin.  When the ANSI sequences get split up over multiple read() calls, the target program doesn't necessarily wait for the full ANSI sequence to arrive, so the target program interprets the left arrow key as its constituent parts: \"Escape\", \"[\", \"C\".\nI informally tested this by writing a simple C program that calls read() in a loop and logs the results.  So as you hit keyboard keys, it logs the bytes of each keystroke, one read() call per line.\nWhen running bash without ConEmu, keystrokes are never split up across multiple read calls.  But within ConEmu, they are occasionally split up.\nHere's the code.  You can save as main.c, compile with gcc main.c, and then run it: stty -icanon -echo ; ./a.out  Hold down a key and watch the program read them from stdin.  Try it in bash and then again in bash within ConEmu.  (stty is required to turn off the tty's echo and canonical modes.

    "LesterCovax": "EDIT: I'm an idiot...somehow skipped over the fact that you're using PowerShell and no VIM (aka everything important).  It still looks like it's a screen write/buffer issue though.  I tried recreating it in ConEmu 180626 running same platform/plugins and couldn't reproduce it.\nWhen I was trying to set up a PS env in Cmder though, I came across a lot of issues.  Cmder utilizes ConEmu, but can also introduce issues like this.  If you're using the default Powershell tasks, it doesn't simply launch PowerShell as you say...it's doing a lot of other stuff too.  Take a look at the vendor\\profile.ps1 file in the Cmder directory to take a look.  I ended up just bypassing it and specifying my own PS profile after running into an issue similar to this one.\nI then came across another issue that resembled what I was experiencing on linux, and they provide a similar fix.  The virtual terminal sequences aren't working correctly, supposedly due to cygwin API issues.  I'd ensure you have Ansi / xterm / Inject ConEmuHK Injection enabled in ConEmu > settings > features.  There's also the option to turn on Log Console Output (*) which will show you all the ANSI sequences being written to your console.  That may shed some light on things. \nIn case it helps, here's the task definition I'm using for an admin PowerShell task.  Change -new_console:a:d:%USERPROFILE% to -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE% for a regular session.\nchcp 65001 & PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoExit -NoProfile -Command \"Invoke-Expression '%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1'\" -new_console:a:d:%USERPROFILE%\nI also had issues with the first powerline for powershell repo I found, and ended up switching to oh-my-posh (which just worked).  I used this guide.\nIf it's an ANSI issue...There are also some examples for testing ANSI support on this ConEmu page, as well as a PS script in vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Addons\\AnsiColors24bit.ps1 that should output a color gradient.  In Bash, I had to add a script into my boot sequence that cats Ansi escape codes to initialize TrueColor correctly.  I used [32766H which resets ANSI support.  Here's the powershell equivalent that's in the ConEmu Addons/AnsiColors24bit.ps1 PS script:\n```powershell\nClean console contents (this will clean TrueColor attributes)\nWrite-Host (([char]27)+\"[32766S\")\nApply default powershell console attributes\ncls\n```\nBack to bash, I go.

This also\n        happens when executing external commands.                             \n    For non-Windows Vim: You can set or reset the 't_ti' and 't_te'       \n    options in your .vimrc.  To disable restoring:                        \n            set t_ti= t_te=                                               \n    To enable restoring (for an xterm):                                   \n            set t_ti=^[7^[[r^[[?47h t_te=^[[?47l^[8                       \n    (Where ^[ is an <Esc>, type CTRL-V <Esc> to insert it)\n\n```\nI'd also make sure powerline-daemon is running to improve its performance, as well as enabling it in VIM in your environment.\nAt the end of my .bashrc\nshell\nPOWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1\nPOWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1\npowerline-daemon -q\n. /home/username/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh\nIn my .vimrc\n```vim\npython3 from powerline.vim import setup as powerline_setup\npython3 powerline_setup()\npython3 del powerline_setup\nset laststatus=2\nset noshowmode\nset termguicolors\n\" set Vim-specific sequences for RGB colors\nlet &t_8f = \"\\[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum\"\nlet &t_8b = \"\\[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum\"\n``. I think that's just a tmux/bash issue.  If you hit enter or runclear(orclear -t ansito not screw up TrueColor) bash should redraw the cursor in the correct position  I'd also try it withpowerline-status` disabled in case that's the issue (which you can also easily enable for tmux, btw).\nEither way, I'm running the latest ConEmu with WSL(bridge)/powerline/tmux as well with no issues:\n\n. @JawnZ no issues with VIM in a tmux session when I tested it.  I tested with powerline for tmux enabled and disabled with no issues.  Whether or not powerline is being used shouldn't matter as far as I can tell since it's also susceptible to the same issue of being supplied incorrect ANSI sequences. . I'd first run :set term (to show you current term type) and :set termcap (to see if t_SI and t_EI are actually set) in VIM, from both putty and conemu.  The escape sequences below that I found match up with the second set you gave, so I'd guess that you have putty running in xterm mode, but xterm isn't enabled in ConEmu's settings.\nvim\nif &term =~ '^xterm\\|rxvt'\n    \" solid underscore\n    let &t_SI .= \"\\<Esc>[4 q\"\n    \" solid block\n    let &t_EI .= \"\\<Esc>[2 q\"\n    \" 1 or 0 -> blinking block\n    \" 3 -> blinking underscore\n    \" Recent versions of xterm (282 or above) also support\n    \" 5 -> blinking vertical bar\n    \" 6 -> solid vertical bar\nendif\nvim\nif &term =~ \"xterm\"\n    let &t_SI = \"\\<Esc>[6 q\"\n    let &t_SR = \"\\<Esc>[4 q\"\n    let &t_EI = \"\\<Esc>[2 q\"\nendif\nSource: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_cursor_shape_in_different_modes\n\nAlso relevent, from here:\n```\nSwitching screens in an xterm       xterm-screens xterm-save-screen\n\n(From comp.editors, by Juergen Weigert, in reply to a question)\n:> Another question is that after exiting vim, the screen is left as it\n:> was, i.e. the contents of the file I was viewing (editing) was left on\n:> the screen. The output from my previous like \"ls\" were lost,\n:> ie. no longer in the scrolling buffer. I know that there is a way to\n:> restore the screen after exiting vim or other vi like editors,\n:> I just don't know how. Helps are appreciated. Thanks.\n:\n:I imagine someone else can answer this.  I assume though that vim and vi do\n:the same thing as each other for a given xterm setup.\nThey not necessarily do the same thing, as this may be a termcap vs.\nterminfo problem.  You should be aware that there are two databases for\ndescribing attributes of a particular type of terminal: termcap and\nterminfo.  This can cause differences when the entries differ AND when of\nthe programs in question one uses terminfo and the other uses termcap\n(also see |+terminfo|).\nIn your particular problem, you are looking for the control sequences\n^[[?47h and ^[[?47l.  These switch between xterms alternate and main screen\nbuffer.  As a quick workaround a command sequence like\n    echo -n \"^[[?47h\"; vim ... ; echo -n \"^[[?47l\"\nmay do what you want.  (My notation ^[ means the ESC character, further down\nyou'll see that the databases use \\E instead).\nOn startup, vim echoes the value of the termcap variable ti (terminfo:\nsmcup) to the terminal.  When exiting, it echoes te (terminfo: rmcup).  Thus\nthese two variables are the correct place where the above mentioned control\nsequences should go.\nCompare your xterm termcap entry (found in /etc/termcap) with your xterm\nterminfo entry (retrieved with \"infocmp -C xterm\").  Both should contain\nentries similar to:\n    :te=\\E[2J\\E[?47l\\E8:ti=\\E7\\E[?47h:\nPS: If you find any difference, someone (your sysadmin?) should better check\n    the complete termcap and terminfo database for consistency.\nNOTE 1: If you recompile Vim with FEAT_XTERM_SAVE defined in feature.h, the\nbuiltin xterm will include the mentioned \"te\" and \"ti\" entries.\nNOTE 2: If you want to disable the screen switching, and you don't want to\nchange your termcap, you can add these lines to your .vimrc:\n    :set t_ti= t_te=\n```.

Is this right?\n\n. @Maximus5 \nI opened the issue because I have to type ConEmu64.exe -run {bash} every time I want to enter to bash mode to use arrow keys. I thought if AppKeys option is enabled automatically when get into bash mode, arrow key issue will be resolved.\n\nYou have to run wsl via connector and wslbridge.\n\nSo, how to I run connector and wslbridge? {Bash::bash} task is already made, and running wsl-con.cmd file doesn't make any change..

As far as I can tell every \"Console\" have its own PID. \nFor example with two opened ssh sessions Windows Task Manager shows three processes with different PIDs:\none for \"kitty -launcher\" and two more for each \"Virtual Console\".\nFurther more even ConEmu's \"Attach to...\" dialog shows two different rows for each console window with different PIDs, Title and HWND (Image Name, Path and window Classname are identical). Kitty launcher itself is not showing in that dialog.\nLittle offtop: starting Kitty in launcher mode from ConEmu itself (or from Task list) opens empty tab and puts kitty in tray. Starting any ssh-session actually opens virtual console inside that tab. But opening another session broke everything as you can't work with it anymore. I am pretty sure its because second session starts inside the same ConEmu tab.\nOne more offtop. Not sure if this info will be helpful but Kitty's console classname is NOT changed if session started from launcher mode:\nkitty.exe -launcher -classname whatever\nputs kitty in tray, but virtual consoles are not changing classname and it still says \"KiTTY\".\nFrom the other hand kitty.exe -classname whatever is working as expected..

The current format must be very useful for some use cases, but I suspect (just a guess) that the majority of users would default to a plain log format.\nBut I'll understand if this is not a priority for you.\nP.S. Do you know of any editor/viewer that interprets the current log format (presenting it in the same manner it was printed to screen)?. Looks like \\x1b[^\\x1b]+\\x1b\\\\ does the trick. \nI haven't lost hope though... ;-)\n1697. So I've gone back to some older logs (I work with logs often, hence my being reluctant to having to post-process them) and found that they used to be pretty readable. They only became not human-readable after this change:\nhttps://conemu.github.io/blog/2018/03/09/Build-180309.html\n\nWrite to ANSI Log calls to certain console WinAPI functions.

    "namazso": "The verifier structures have been provided in Windows 2003 R2 DDK, and the project already uses exported / exposed but undocumented features.\nI didn't think of it as replacing the process hooks with this entirely, more like adding it as an additional option. I, for one, would prefer verifier auto-injection and no hooks on a single executable, than injection into vital processes like explorer and placing hooks there. For production in general, avoiding both of these would be the best, but unfortunately that is not a possibility here.. Additionally, the driver option is still there, and it requires a single undocumented but exported function, present since Windows 98. (maybe even that can be avoided too with some directory hackery, I'm not sure) Might want to consider that too in case the verifier option still sounds too risky.. "
