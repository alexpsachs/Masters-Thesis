The test project didn't contain comparisons to protobuf-csharp-port, so it\nis hard for me to comment, but my initial thought is: the google\nimplementation does a lot of the serialization work in the builder, so if\nyou aren't measuring object construction time and object query time - that\nis probably a huge part of the difference. The MS impl is a more\nfeature-parity comparison. I've tidied up some glitches in the code (let me\nknow if you want the revised .cs back), and I get data like:\n\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1594 deser:1531 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1172 deser:2156 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1625 deser:2047 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1437 deser:3391 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1594 deser:1531 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1156 deser:2250 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1610 deser:1531 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1156 deser:2250 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1609 deser:1532 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1156 deser:2172 len:432\nGeneral conclusions, then: at the moment, protobuf-net on the data is\nfaster at serialization, but slightly slower on deserialization.\nInvestigating the exact time is tricky, and I can't give an immediate\nanswer on that, but it is something I can look at to see if there's a\n\"trick\" I can do here. But overall, they are very comparable. I'm not sure\nit is worth getting excited over the difference between them....\nOn 9 July 2014 22:08, Marc Gravell marc.gravell@gmail.com wrote:\n\nI have an email citing \"TestProto\" - if that is it, I will review it in\nthe morning (I'm on mobile right now; this needs a PC)\n On 9 Jul 2014 22:04, \"abcpp\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThank you!

Another random thought; is it possible that your string has a trailing nul? That would result in:\n(blah...)-12-09-73-6F-6D-65-43-69-74-79-00\n(in partcular, note the 12-09-...-00) - note that this is still perfectly valid protobuf, and if this is what the scenario is, I would say that protostuff has a string-reading bug - sounds unlikely, though.\n. I'm assuming this is \"SOLNA\" ?\nAgreed: tag 90 is field-number 11. Just to check: is there a field 11 in\nyour message? If not, it sounds like a nasty bug in the output generation.\nI would love to see a complete runnable sample that generates the wrong\noutput.\nOn 15 October 2014 11:15, Johannes Elgh notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOkay sorry, that zero in the sequence above wasn't related to my problem.\nThis is from the Java side, I'm stepping through the ProtoStuff code.

The first thing it\nreads, inside this nested message, is buffer position 202: 7. It uses the\ntwo lines above making tag=7 and therefore fieldNumber=0.\nThe continuation of the two lines above:\nfinal int tag = readRawVarint32();\n    final int fieldNumber = tag >>> TAG_TYPE_BITS;\n    if (fieldNumber == 0)\n    {\n        if (decodeNestedMessageAsGroup && WIRETYPE_TAIL_DELIMITER == (tag & TAG_TYPE_MASK)) // WIRETYPE_TAIL_DELIMITER = 7\n        {\n            // protostuff's tail delimiter for streaming\n            // 2 options: length-delimited or tail-delimited.\n            lastTag = 0;\n            return 0;\n        }\n        ...\nProtoStuff is going through all the incoming fieldNumbers and aborts\nlooping when fieldNumber is 0. Therefore the nested message Location is\nnever populated since the looping is aborted immediately. It moves out to\nthe outer message (class A). Here the next byte it finds is 26 (pos 203\nabove). This should actually belong to the nested message Location but is\npopulating the wrong field in the outer message.\nAs I described in the GoogleGroup thread I'm very new to Protocol Buffers\nso I'm not sure what this all means.

So to be clear, then; what makes you think there is a problem? The 9 bytes in the binary you posted most recently says:\n\"field 11, string, length 7\" (2 bytes)\n    \"field 3, string, length 5\" (2 bytes)\n        \"SOLNA\" (5 bytes)\nIf field 11 is a location with Coordinate = null, Accuracy = 0 and City = \"SOLNA\", then that is entirely reasonable. So: what makes you think there is an issue? What is the symptom? \n. From your comment here:\n\nThe first thing it reads, inside this nested message, is buffer position 202: 7. It uses the two lines above making tag=7 and therefore fieldNumber=0.\n\nwhat you are describing here is a bug in protostuff; a tag with value 90 indicates a length-prefixed type (aka \"string\"). The correct thing to do next is to read a varint, which indicates the length of the content - in this case, 7 bytes. The content starts after the 7. If protostuff isn't reading the varint that denotes the length: then it is doing it wrong. You can refer to the \"Strings\" and \"Embedded Messages\" sections of the encoding spec for more information.\n. Step back; what are these 3 different DLLs? What is the difference between\nthem?

I've had quite a lot of discussion on this one lately. Short recap:\n- yes, I'm basically in favor of adding the UTC kind, and wish it had been added at the origin\n- but: there is a genuine and real problem with enabling this by default, as it will change the output when people expect it to be consistent\n- but I'm all in favor of making it opt-in, disabled by default\n\nGiven that it will involve IL-emit changes, I'm tempted just to do it, to avoid the ongoing debate ;p\nI have some ideas towards some kind of \"backlevel compatibility\" flag to avoid having to set lots of flags manually, although I'm also tempted to do some kind of assembly-level configuration, i.e.\n[assembly:ProtoConfiguration(DateTimeKind = true, GuidsShouldNotBeBatshitCrazy = true)]\nBut that is probably a discussion for another thread.\n.

Interesting. Does it do that if the number is 1, not 0? 0 is not a valid protobuf field number\n. Ah, this is probably the annoying \"implicit defaults\" - an early design choice that is much regretted. Try adding:\n[DefaultValue(true)]\nTo the property. That should hopefully fit it.\n. This is simply a poor design choice that happened many many years ago in v1 of protobuf-net. What I should have done is only use explicit default values. How the code was implemented - and remains the default, for compatibility - is that it assumes \"zero\" as the default, unless told otherwise (or unless some kind of conditional serialization is in play, for example Nullable-of-T, ShouldSerialize, or Specified). There is actually an option to disable this if you create your own RuntimeTypeModel instance rather than using .Default - something like \".UseImplicitZeroDefaults\".\nThe [DefaultValue(true)] in this case simply gives the library more clue as to what is an actual value vs a default.\n. the fundsmental thing here is that the .proto schema proessing needs a\nsingnificant overhaul (read: rewrite) in order to be viable in the\nxplat/core-clr world.

Marking as closed.. Yeah, I'm not going to simply remove all enum verification, so I'm not going to merge the PR \"as is\", but I am open to suggestions on what the right \"fix\" is - if there is any. As noted, there is support to disable enum verification, and this is done automatically if [Flag] is on the enum. It can also be specified per-enum in the metadata via [ProtoContract(EnumPassthru = true)]. And it can be set at runtime for other types via RuntimeTypeModel.\nIs that not enough?. I'm going to close this PR as it is unmergeable in git terms, plus I think the code suggested is the wrong fix; but I'm open to further discussion on the topic both here or in a separate issue..

Do you mean System.Runtime.Serialization.EnumMemberAttribute? If so: indeed - it is a string. I believe there is a ProtoEnumAttribute in the protobuf namespace that should do what you want.\n. The current build makes no attempt to TryParse etc the enum values,\nbecause in the general case, it is not expected that they will have\nnumeric values in EnumMemberAttribute attributes. Dapper treats enums as\ninteger types. However, can I ask: do you actually need to do anything\nhere? normally, enums serialize just fine without any extra work. And there\nare ways such as [Flags] to get it to treat it as a raw number without\nenum handling at all.

I don't think we can just enable this - it is a breaking change, especially for people who expect the data output to be reproducible. To merge this, I would want to make this \"opt-in\", perhaps via a global setting, so that it doesn't adversely impact other users. If it was in from day zero, that would be different.\nThoughts?\n. Note: it is fine to always process during deserialization as long as the old default is preserved: it is only during serialization that we need to check a flag \n. I need to look more at the arrays - yes my main concern was the date times\n. I'm fully aware of the aim that parsers should ignore unknown fields; but\nI'm also aware that many people expect the output to remain consistent -\nand I know of a few implementations that this change would actively break\n(for example, when using the output as \"set\" values in things like redis).\nIt would also break a lot of peoples' tests that assert \"the output of this\ninput is this binary\".

But that is largely unrelated to the issue. As I tried to explain, the problem is not about deserialization (indeed, I mentioned that deserialization wouldn't even need to check any config option)  but: serialization, and the effects of suddenly changing the output of the serialization process between versions. I also tried to outline several of the scenarios that I actively know about that would be impacted by this. People reasonably expect the binary data to change if they add fields etc, but not unexpectedly from this; the path of least failure is thus to make it an opt-in configuration option.\nI'm sorry if this has caused you frustration, but I need to consider all users.\n. The redis scenario was simply one of many that immediately leapt to mind re people not expecting the same data to serialise to different bytes today vs tomorrow. And technically, that would most likely be a value not a key.\n\nFrom my point of view the only requirement the library should support is... \"The protobuf-net library must be able to deserialize protobuf strings serialized by older versions.\"\n\n\"don't unexpectedly change the output\" is also a key requirement. And one that can be accommodated at the same time by making it a configurable option.\n\nbut as a user it would be frustrating having to set various obscure options in order to have the library work correctly\n\nI understand your point - and sure, if this were day zero, it would be great to include this from the start, but: it wasn't, and because I need to support existing users, I can't just change this blindly. I think it is a posititive change, but it needs to be done with appropriate consideration for known scenarios.\nI'm still trying to stabilise the CoreCLR branch, but once that is in, I'll see if I can bring these things together. But if I do: there will be a configuration setting.\nIt makes me wonder if there's some kind of \"compatibility profile\" that could be devised - heck, I'd nuke implicit zero defaults at the same time... but I wonder if rather than setting lots of individual properties, setting some kind of CompatilibilityOption = {version}.

I would also question the usefulness; it isn't like xml and json - most people won't have a clue how to interpret the data.\n. the only way to safely do that would be to grab the data from the ioBuffer before adding it to the exception, so the only thing you're adding is isolated; however, protobuf is a binary format, and in the general case we should not expect it to be likely to contain text\n. ioBuffer can be pretty huge, though - I would advise only copying (say) a max of 100 bytes either side of where it exploded (would need some min/max checks, etc); additionally, note that you should only look at most at the known available bytes - anything past that point is potentially garbage and unrelated to the current problem: it would be unnecessarily confusing to report that as though it were part of the problem, when it isn't.\nFinally, in terms of allocation and large blocks, this isn't ideal - it kinda feels like this should be opt-in (although it is fine if the message says \"enable ShowBufferContentsInExceptions to view the data at the time of the error\", or something like that)\n. I'm confused - you've opened and closed within an hour; was this mistaken?\n. Is it possible that any thread is changing the list contents at this\ntime? I suspect the problem is most likely 2 (or more) threads talking to\nthe same instance - some reading (presumably serialising), and one\nwriting - perhaps doing something completely unrelated to serialization,\nlike obj.Items.Add(newItem);\nI can try to help, but threading issues need a lot of context, typically.\nOn 16 May 2015 10:21 pm, \"Alexey Solovyov\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi Marc, is there a chance that you can handle this issue, may be we can\ndiscuss commercial support?\nParallel threads try to serialize Entity with List where obj1 has inside\nserializable List.\nWe work with protobuf-net more then 1 year, current version 2.0.0.668 and\nnever had problems like that before (or we didn't notice that).\nWe got serialization wrapper:\npublic static byte[] SerializeProtobuf(this object data)\n{\nbyte[] bt = null;\nusing (System.IO.MemoryStream ms = new System.IO.MemoryStream())\n{\nProtoBuf.Serializer.NonGeneric.Serialize(ms, data);\nbt = ms.ToArray();\nms.Close();\n}\nreturn bt;\n}\nAlso, in the procedure, who is called by parallel threads, we use and\ndeserialization and serialization of the same entity type.\nAll technical nuances can be supplied to you in case of your interest.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/87#issuecomment-102699378\n.\n.

There are ways to make this semi-automated, but the easiest way would be to explicitly mark them:\n```\n[DataMember(Order=1)]\npublic string ABC {get;set;}\n[DataMember(Order=2)]\npublic int QWE {get;set;}\n```\nThat should fix it.\n. Well, in this scenario the first thing I'd note is that using implementation details (such as Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Entity) in serialization layers is not a great idea - it creates a huge number of traps. Frankly, if serialization of an existing object model becomes non-trivial, the best approach is not \"fight the serializer\" but rather \"create a simple DTO that fits the serializer perfectly\"\nAs it happens, protobuf-net does have things like ImplicitFields that can help in some of these scenarios, but it only looks at the declaring type, not base-types - so it wouldn't pull from Entity. protobuf-net also has the ability to configure types manually, but that would require you adding code to your app-init. But to give an example broadly similar to yours:\n```\nusing ProtoBuf;\nusing ProtoBuf.Meta;\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        RuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(MyObj), false).Add(\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Name\");\n        var obj = new MyObj { Name = \"abc\", Foo = 123, Bar = \"def\" };\n        var clone = Serializer.DeepClone(obj);\n        Console.WriteLine(obj);\n        Console.WriteLine(clone);\n    }\n}\n[DataContract] public class MyObj : Entity {\n    [DataMember] public string Name { get; set; }\n    public override string ToString() => $\"{Name}, {Foo}, {Bar}\";\n}\n[DataContract] public class Entity {\n    [DataMember] public int Foo { get; set; }\n    [DataMember] public string Bar { get; set; }\n}\n```\nNote here that the order of the members in Add defines their wire identity - so Foo is 1, Bar is 2, etc. Depending on your C# version, you may also wish to look at nameof rather than hard-coded strings:\nRuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(MyObj), false).Add(\n            nameof(Entity.Foo), nameof(Entity.Bar), nameof(MyObj.Name));\nIs any of that useful?\n. Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.AttributeCollection is basically a\nDictionary, which protobuf-net is going to hate. The\nprotobuf format is designed to serialize models with a well-known shape /\nformat - which \"object\" isn't. There is no good way to handle a\nstring-object map in protobuf; there are some bad ways, but that depends a\nlot on what the actual values are in your scenario.\n. The problem isn't the map - protobuf-net would happily support\nDictionary<string,Project>, to use the example from your links; it is the\n\"object\". Protobuf wants to know what it is deserializing. So again: what\nare the actual values?\nOn 7 March 2016 at 09:14, rebulanyum notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWell it's just a collection with items of type KeyValuePair. Right?

But\nfundamentally, I would again simply suggest that anything based on this\nmuch implementation details rather than data details isn't a good choice\nfor serialization.

K; I've fixed the library to stop it exploding, but the fundamental problem here is that a type (to protobuf-net) can either be a leaf or a list, not both; in being enumerable of itself, it tries to be both. The code isn't going to like the \"list\" style (it ... just doesn't parse), so it now reverts to \"leaf\". This will, however, mean that to get this to behave as you expect, you will need to still expose the downstream tree; this could be done by:\n\n[ProtoMember(3)] // or whatever\nprotected List<TreeObject> _children =\n. Note: to fix this using the existing library, you should be able to do:\n[ProtoContract(IgnoreListHandling = true)]\nclass Problematic : IEnumerable\n{\n    [ProtoMember(3)] // or whatever\n    protected List<TreeObject> _children =\nhere the IgnoreListHandling is checked before the code that is currently causing it to explode.\n. The problem here is that it grarually becomes prohibitively and\ndisproportionately time consuming to support older runtimes. For context,\nMS .NET 4.51 support ended over a year ago (\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/08/07/moving-to-the-net-framework-4-5-2/\n).\nThis is especially challenging given the changes to the build process etc.\nWhich needs another overhaul for the csproj changes, but that's another\nstory.\nThe long and short, then, will be:\n\nif I do the csproj changes (imminent) and the old versions \"just work\"\n(meaning: fall into place without me going crazy), then great: I'll include\nthem\notherwise, if someone can figure out what the csproj and build changes\nare to make it successfully target those versions without causing problems,\nthen a PR will be gratefully received and merged\n\nHistorically I have tried to consider back-level - heck, it even used to\ncompile on C#1.2 (.Net 1.1), and might still do so! But: there comes a time\nwhen it isn't the best use of my time to try to do so.\nI also have concerns that continuing to support these very very old\nruntimes is me being an \"enabler\" when what I should actually be doing is\nadvocating for you to move to an up to date framework.\nOn 27 Jan 2017 5:32 p.m., \"Artem Kravchenko\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nThe same problem (.NET 3.5)\nCould not install package 'protobuf-net 2.1.0'.

So I set up a minimal asp.net core site, used install-package protobuf-net (it picked up 2.1.0), added some protobuf-net code, and... it simply worked. Cannot repro the issue. Please can you give more context about what you're doing. In particular, if you are using any indirect tooling (things that reference protobuf-net), check that either they have been updated, or that you have an assembly binding redirect (which should be added automatically when you install from nuget).\n\nFor completeness, here's the code I added to the /Home/About route of the default asp.net core app:\n```\n    [ProtoContract]\n    public class Foo\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)]\n        public string Bar { get; set; }\n    }\n    public IActionResult About()\n    {\n        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            Serializer.Serialize(ms, new Foo { Bar = \"hello world\" });\n            ArraySegment buffer;\n            if (!ms.TryGetBuffer(out buffer)) throw new InvalidOperationException();\n        ViewData[\"Message\"] = BitConverter.ToString(\n            buffer.Array, buffer.Offset, buffer.Count);\n    }\n    return View();\n}\n\n```\nand here's the PMC:\nPM> install-package protobuf-net\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration1-gz/protobuf-net/index.json\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration1-gz/protobuf-net/index.json 136ms\nRetrieving package 'protobuf-net 2.1.0' from 'nuget.org'.\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/protobuf-net/2.1.0/protobuf-net.2.1.0.nupkg\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/protobuf-net/2.1.0/protobuf-net.2.1.0.nupkg 459ms\nInstalling protobuf-net 2.1.0.\nInstalling NuGet package protobuf-net.2.1.0.\nSuccessfully installed 'protobuf-net 2.1.0' to WebApplication1\nExecuting nuget actions took 1.39 sec\nTime Elapsed: 00:00:03.0723974\n. Actually, I'd used core-clr by mistake, but doing the same thing in asp.net core using .net framework also worked perfectly; minor tweak to the test code:\n```\n    public IActionResult About()\n    {\n        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            Serializer.Serialize(ms, new Foo { Bar = \"hello world\" });\n        ViewData[\"Message\"] = BitConverter.ToString(\n            ms.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)ms.Length);\n    }\n    return View();\n}\n\n```\n(TryGetBuffer vs GetBuffer())\nStill cannot repro.\n. Ah, k; an assembly binding redirect should also fix that.  I don't know if it has changed in the latest tooling, but app.config (not web.config) used to be the home for this: http://blog.rytmis.net/2016/03/29/asp-net-core-and-assembly-binding-redirects/\n. Inherit from Extensible. Add members for your 1 and 2. The rest should be\nstored opaquely without you needing to know anything about them.\nSo:\n```\n[ProtoContract] class Foo : Extensible {\n    [ProtoMember(1)] public string X {...}\n    [ProtoMember(2)] public string Y {...}\n}\n```\nOn Tue, 26 Jul 2016 15:57 Alexander Lutz, notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMaybe it is an stupid question but I couldn't find an solution.\nI've got an byte[] of serialized data and I know that first & second proto\nmembers in it are strings.

Can I see the model? (the classes). Very hard to comment without that.\nAlso, is it possible that you have the same repeated object in the tree\nmultiple times? (for example, a City object where 20 customers all have the\nsame City instance) - protobuf-net is a tree serializer by default, so that\ndata would be repeated. BF is a graph serializer that uses object tracking\n- however protobuf-net also has this as an optional feature.\n\nOn 5 Jan 2017 2:38 a.m., \"SidneyWells\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm converting a .NET 4.0 C# app to use protobuf-net for binary\nserialisation.

This appears to be fixed - I think via a contributed PR at some point. Closing.. There is a pre-existing Serializer.NonGeneric.TryDeserializeWithLengthPrefix, but that takes an awkward TypeResolver; will look at the PR (and: sorry for delay, I've been.... distracted). Re \"really big integers\": that's actually part of the protobuf spec (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto):\nThe smallest tag number you can specify is 1, and the largest is 229 - 1, or 536,870,911.\n\n(unless the obsolete and undocumented \"message-set\" encoding is used, but protobuf-net doesn't support message-set encoding - it isn't even part of the formal specification, although I've reverse-engineered it and understand what it needs to look like)\nHowever, I'm happy to check to see that appropriate and useful errors are being raised.  The exception thing (base class) - yup, sounds like a bug. Will target both in 2.31. you're absolutely right, of course; either it needs to work, or it needs to fail as early as possible with a meaningful message; I've shipped 2.3.0, so I'm starting the 2.3.1 work currently (this issue is tagged for 2.3.1).. appreciated, thanks. if the main issue here is UWP, that's on the roadmap as a future item. This is an interesting one; I need to think about how this should work. The non-trivial part of the issue is that enums in protobuf are only defined for 32-bit values. However, since 2.3.0 adds much improved enum pass-thru support (consistent with proto3 runtime behaviour), it might be that we can simply treat long enums as direct pass-thru. Needs consideration. Adding to 2.3.1. The previous comment is correct, but to be more specific: because you write\nmultiple times to the same stream without rewinding/clearing the contents,\nyou are essentially concatenating all the objects into a single stream -\nso the overall length of data will be (number of objects)*(size of object).\nAs an aside, this also means it isn't a like for like performance test,\nespecially for deserialization!\nNow, protobuf is designed such that append===merge. So from protobuf's\nperspective, you have written a single object with many many key/value\npairs - most of which are duplicates. If you ever need to do what you are\ndoing here (writing multiple objects sequentially), the\nSerializeWithLengthPrefix and DeserializeWithLengthPrefix methods will help\nyou - basically they allow you to tell the system how to identify\nindividual objects. However, in your case what you should probably do is\nrewind and clear the stream between writes, so:\nfor(...) {\n    ms.Position = 0;\n    ms.Length = 0;\n// not shown: serialize to ms here\n\n}\n// read the contents of the final write:\nvar arr = ms.ToArray();\nOn 23 February 2017 at 17:38, Snarly Narwhal notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI get a SystemArgumentException: \"An item with the same key has already\nbeen added.\" when deserializing a dictionary.

For example\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic List<Foo> Items {get; } = new List<Foo>();\n\nprotobuf-net is fine with things like that. If you want lazier initialization, then you can do that with more nuanced getters, for example:\nprivate List<Foo> _items;\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic List<Foo> Items => items ??

This is a requirement for proto3 (you are using proto2 by default, since you don't have syntax = \"proto3\";). Fixed in 2.3.0; example output:\n```\n[global::ProtoBuf.ProtoContract()]\npublic partial class EnumFirstIsNonZero\n{\n    [global::ProtoBuf.ProtoMember(1, Name = @\"optional\")]\n    [global::System.ComponentModel.DefaultValue(Foo.A)]\n    public Foo Optional\n    {\n        get { return __pbn__Optional ??

All great extra context, thanks. Merged.. All good extra context, cheers. Merging as another interesting comparison / line in the sand - but in that outcome we'd just use Task<T> from the outset - both have the same allocation issue, and direct Task<T> is marginally faster. Odd that it is faster to wrap a ValueTask<T> into a Task<T> than to use await on the original ValueTask<T>!. If I get a chance later I'll try with float and double (without a reference wrapper) - see if there's a stack size limit where the suckage starts.. The protobuf format doesn't include field names, so the code needs some mechanism to know which members map to which field numbers in the data, and it needs to be reliable, i.e. you'll always get the same mapping - today, tomorrow, and two months from now.\n\none of the ways to do this is by annotating the object via attributes - this can be done via any of [ProtoMember], [DataMember] or [XmlElement] (in the last two cases, you will need to include the field number in the optional Order member). If you have code-generated entity models, there is also a [ProtoPartialMember] that can be added in a separate partial class file to allow you to attach numbers to members in the generated file without having to edit the generated file.\nAnother way you can do it is by asking the library to just assume that you're never going to change your type, and use the alphabetical order of the members.  You would do this via [ProtoContract(InferTagFromName = true)] - or to apply this as a more general default: RuntimeTypeModel.Default.InferTagFromNameDefault. However, this should not be done lightly - it makes your types very brittle - adding, removing or renaming members can (will) make the data unreliable.\nIndividual types can also be configured entirely manually using the RuntimeTypeModel / MetaType API in the library.\nWould any of those options suffice? If you are more specific about what issue you are facing, I can advise further.. > Please suggest something\nto repeat:\n\nWould any of those options suffice?

You haven't rewound the MemoryStream - if you are \"old school\" like me, think of VHS or audio cassettes: the MemoryStream is currently at the end, there is nothing to read. As it happens, 0 bytes is a perfectly valid length to protobuf. All you need is ms.Position = 0;.\nAdditional notes:\n\nvar dcat = Serializer.DeepClone(cat); would do all of this in one go\nthe generic Serializer.Serialize(ms, cat) and Serializer.Deserialize<Cat>(ms) API may be easier for you to use. because that isn't how you usually use streams - indeed, most streams\narent rewindable (TCP sockets, etc).

Well that's embarrassing. I suspect you're right! . Hi; for some reason all my usual github notifications got blown away, so I only noticed this because of @nathvi 's comment (I rebuilt all my notifications the other day). I will look this evening and see what's wrong.. I'm assuming that myIP is an IPEndPoint. For the purposes of testing this, I generated a random IP and am using:\n\nvar myIP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"220.5.105.207\"), 6379);\n\nThis fails in the way you describe.\nYou can see the problem here if we look at the stacktrace:\nUnhandled Exception: System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced\n   at System.Net.IPAddress.get_ScopeId()\n   at IPAddressSurrogate.op_Implicit(IPAddress value) in C:\\Users\\mgravell\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2017\\Projects\\ConsoleApp12\\ConsoleApp12\\Program.cs:line 44\nNotice that it is failing when accessing the ScopeId, and sure enough - if we forget about protobuf, and just look at myIP.ScopeId, that alone is enough to make it fail. So; let's assume we don't need that and just throw it away (remove ScopeId completely in the surrogate and operators).\nThis now (for me) fails with a complaint about no wire-value for InterNetwork. I think this is just because the surrogate feature was never intended to work with enums; if we remove all mention of AddressFamilySurrogate, the code now runs, but doesn't actually serialize anything - that's because IPAddressSurrogate has no members marked for serialization - but... on investigation, I don't think we even need IPAddressSurrogate - the only interesting property that we actually need to store is IPString - or the bytes equivalent. I'm going to stick with the string approach.\nNext I notice that the conversion operators are failing because of the null initial values - conversion operators on reference types need to handle null (usually by passing it through).\nAnd you don't seem to be storing the Port, which is essential.\nAt this point I took a step back, because I think you're making this way, way more complicated than necessary. I'm pretty sure that all you need is:\n```\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class IPEndPointSurrogate\n{\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic string Address { get; set; }\n\n[ProtoMember(2)]\npublic int Port { get; set; }\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPointSurrogate(IPEndPoint value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPointSurrogate { Address = value.Address.ToString(), Port = value.Port };\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPoint(IPEndPointSurrogate value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(value.Address), value.Port);\n\n}\n```\nwith example usage:\n```\npublic static class P\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        RuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(IPEndPoint), false)\n            .SetSurrogate(typeof(IPEndPointSurrogate));\n    var myIP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"220.5.105.207\"), 6379);\n    using (var ipStream = new MemoryStream())\n    {\n        Serializer.Serialize(ipStream, myIP);\n        ipStream.Position = 0;\n        var clone = (IPEndPoint)Serializer.Deserialize<IPEndPoint>(ipStream);\n        Console.WriteLine(clone.ToString());\n\n        // prove it worked:\n        Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(clone, myIP)); // false, different objects\n        Console.WriteLine(Equals(clone, myIP)); // true, count as equivalent\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nI'm not sure if I've answered the question, but...\nNote it will be slightly smaller if we use raw bytes intead:\n```\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class IPEndPointSurrogate\n{\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic byte[] Address { get; set; }\n\n[ProtoMember(2)]\npublic int Port { get; set; }\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPointSurrogate(IPEndPoint value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPointSurrogate { Address = value.Address.GetAddressBytes(), Port = value.Port };\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPoint(IPEndPointSurrogate value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPoint(new IPAddress(value.Address), value.Port);\n\n}\n``. I don't think there's much useful that protobuf-net can do for anint` - using the base serializer should probably be fine. Does it work?. IMO the problem is here:\nEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(messageString)\n\nIt isn't clear what messageString is here, but a .NET string is not a valid way to pass around raw binary (see previous blog entry).\nCan you indicate what messageString is and where it came from?\nIf you absolutely must use a string for some reason, then base-64 is your friend (Convert.ToBase64String() and Convert.FromBase64String()). Otherwise, prefer something like byte[] or Stream for raw data.\nWhat redis client are you using? StackExchange.Redis supports byte[] - anything that accepts a RedisValue can take a byte[]. Redis itself is binary-safe.. at the raw redis level, you want LRANGE ; I can't advise on ServiceStack. Basically: if you can get the original binary back, I can help. Until you have the same binary data that you wanted to store, protobuf-net doesn't stand a chance of succeeding. It sounds like your blocker is upstream of protobuf-net.\nWorst case, if the problem is that your client doesn't work with binary: base-64. I'm closing this because it doesn't sound like a protobuf-net issue, but if I've misunderstood please reopen or ping me. I think this is already fixed; hard to tell if we fixed it the same way, as all I can see in the merge is a sea of red and green; that file has changed radically in the last day. But running the \"failing\" example gives:\n```\npragma warning disable CS1591\n[global::ProtoBuf.ProtoContract(Name = @\"Test\")]\npublic partial class Test\n{\n    [global::ProtoBuf.ProtoMember(1, Name = @\"fs\", IsPacked = true)]\n    public float[] Fs { get; set; }\n}\npragma warning restore CS1591\n```\n. Very much appreciated, but already found and fixed separately, and is going to be impossible to merge. Keep 'em coming, though!. I don't currently offer that, mostly because nobody has ever asked. If you have something in mind, feel free to ping me (marc.gravell@gmail.com), ideally spelling out whether you're after:\n\na specific feature addition / tweak\nadvice and guidance\ntroubleshooting / bug report\netc\n\nNote that I have recently added a librepay account in case anyone wants to make any donations, but: that is (by definition) not intended for work-in-kind things. https://liberapay.com/protobuf-net/donate. Ultimately, the protobuf format has no mechanism to express this. I could silently ignore them; would that be preferable?. if you Deserialize<List<T>>, how would you know whether to expect the shim or not? how would it work for append-only files? if the first list you append has nulls, the second list doesn't, and the third list does again? having a different shape depending on whether there are nulls or not is a very bad idea, IMO, and is going to lead to huge injuries - the effect is non-obvious.\nIMO the real fix here is: since you know you have nulls, manually create a root object that has a list marked for nullable support, and serialize that instead. Then it is in your control, and not down to the library to make arbitrary opinionated decisions.. wow, that's pretty cute; much obliged. merged and deployed, but I notice that \"generate\" now only works once - any ideas? I can take a look later, but obviously you're more familiar. I like that the errors move to the right squigglies, btw - I'm glad I went to the trouble of tracking the full token ranges :). also: it doesn't show the generated code when there are only warnings; this may or may not be the same issue. ah, got it; if it fails with an exception, the exception is returned in the JSON but not displayed anywhere; actual bug causing it to throw was mine.

Regarding running protoc: do you actually need the includes? I am not involved in the official Google implementation, so I cannot advise on how to get protoc to behave, since that isn't my tooling. However! I do expose both protogen (the new incomplete rewrite) and protoc on my website:  https://protogen.marcgravell.com/\nRe ClaimsPrincipal; I don't know enough about that type. What do you actually need to serialize to store and rehydrate one of those? I genuinely don't know. However, protobuf-net includes features that allow you to get the serializer to automatically use a  simple DTO (serializaiton) type in place of a complex POCO object as long as you provide a method to get between them. So if you can say \"to work a ClaimsPrincipal I need to store a string, 3 integers and a boolean\" - then I can tell you how to get it to do that.. K\nOption 0:\nMy preferred option would be to serialize an object model that just doesn't have the complex non-serializable thing in it. Leave that entirely in the code that is downstream. That isn't always possible, so:\nOption 1:\nRetain your existing model, but have a shim property on your type; so while you might have:\npublic SomethingComplex ProblematicProperty {get;set;}\n\nyou could add:\n[ProtoMember(12)]\nprivate SomethingSimple ProblematicPropertySerialized {\n    get { /* convert from ProblematicProperty */ }\n    set { /* convert from value and assign into ProblematicProperty */ }\n}\n\n(and you write a SomethingSimple type that meets your needs and works with the serializer)\nhowever, I acknowledge that this also isn't always possible. In that case, you can hack around it with...\nOption 2\na surrogate - the key point here is the SetSurrogate method which expects there to be conversion operators between the two types (on the assumption that you're writing the surrogate type specifically for this purpose, so that's fine); you can see this in the runnable example below. The idea is the same, but instead of using a shim property, the library does that step for you.\nAnd to answer your question: no, don't touch ISerializable\n```\nusing ProtoBuf;\nusing ProtoBuf.Meta;\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var obj = new MyData { Id = 1, Foo = new ComplexNonSerializableClass() };\n    RuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(ComplexNonSerializableClass), false)\n        .SetSurrogate(typeof(SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar));\n    var clone = Serializer.DeepClone(obj);\n}\n\n\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class MyData\n{\n    [ProtoMember(1)]\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    [ProtoMember(2)]\n    public ComplexNonSerializableClass Foo {get;set;}\n}\n\npublic class ComplexNonSerializableClass\n{\n     // ... real code here, obviously - although this probably isn't\n     // your type in the first place - it is probably a BCL type\n}\n\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar\n{\n    public static implicit operator SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar(ComplexNonSerializableClass other)\n    {   // ... real code here, obviously\n        return new SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar { Name = \"abc\", Whatever = 123 };\n    }\n    public static implicit operator ComplexNonSerializableClass(SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar other)\n    {\n        return new ComplexNonSerializableClass(); // ... real code here, obviously\n    }\n\n    [ProtoMember(1)]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [ProtoMember(2)]\n    public int Whatever { get; set; }\n}\n\n}\n```. I'm glad you were able to make progress; I'm going to close this, but feel free to ping me if there's something else.. The library always intends to be as compatible in every direction as possible. That is a key aim of both protobuf as a general concept, and protobuf-net as a specific implementation of protobuf.\nIn the case of DateTimeKind - this data is tagged in as an additional optional field. As you correctly assume, if an older library doesn't know what to do with that, it will just ignore it.\nNote that this is not always possible, though. As a specific example, Google added \"Timestamp\" as a common standard for storing date-time data (long after I'd written protobuf-net's DateTime representation). I plan to add Timestamp support in 2.3.0, probably doing something like:\n[ProtoMember(1, DataFormat = DataFormat.WellKnown)]\npublic DateTime When {get;set;}\n\nThis uses a different format. If there was old code that used 2.1.0 (or whatever) and had (since DataFormat.WellKnown doesn't exist yet):\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic DateTime When {get;set;}\n\nthen when this code tries to deserialize the time, it will either fail or silently come up with a nonsensical value. Ultimately, changing the DataFormat property of a member is almost always a breaking change in your data. I do not plan on changing the default DateTime / DataFormat matching, for exactly the reasons you highlight: compatibility.\nThe protobuf wire format has not changed at all, even with the addition of proto3 - so there shouldn't be any fundamentally changing ideas, at least until some hypothetical proto4; and if that happens, I would expect to add configuration options to enable this, so that nothing changes how existing code behaves. For example, if that happened, I would probably change:\npublic void Serialize<T>(Stream s, T value, ...\n\nto:\n[Obsolete(\"Please explicitly specify the protocol version; Proto2 is assumed by default\")]\npublic void Serialize<T>(Stream s, T value, ...) => Serialize<T>(s, value, ProtocolVersion.Proto2);\npublic void Serialize<T>(Stream s, T value, ProtocolVersion version, ...)\n\nif that makes sense. Basically, I will always go out of my way to avoid making it easy to fail. Which is, IMO, the entire point of a library.. I literally threw CommonCodeGenerator together as a starting point. I'm completely open to other radical ideas, although also note that CodeGenerator (the base) doesn't use that pattern at all - it may be that is the better fit for your scenario?. they're right next to the file in your own link (top post); https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/parser/src/protogen/CodeGenerator.cs. There's also [ProtoContract(EnumPassthru = true)] at the enum level. Wouldn't it make more sense for your test to just use:\n[ProtoContract(Name = @\"TestEnum\", EnumPassthru = true)]\n\n? I'm open to the idea; I'm just not sure that there's a necessity for it... and global options are almost always problematic, especially in complex systems where one bit of code expects the global option to be one way, and another bit of code expects it to be the opposite.. K; interesting thing I notice: in proto3 (and in contrast to proto2), there is a new additional paragraph that clarifies how it expects unknown enums to be handled:\n\nDuring deserialization, unrecognized enum values will be preserved in the message, though how this is represented when the message is deserialized is language-dependent. In languages that support open enum types with values outside the range of specified symbols, such as C++ and Go, the unknown enum value is simply stored as its underlying integer representation.\n\nBecause of this, I think it is entirely reasonable for proto3-based generation to automatically include EnumPassthru = true. It helps that proto3 has more sensible rules for enums that make this more ... possible.\nI notice that RTB is implicitly a proto2 schema, so the interesting question for me is: \"should we interpret this paragraph as applying retrospectively to proto2?\". And if we do: what are the consequences? Are there problems where this will be actively harmful?\nLet me have a think about that. It might be that we can magic this away completely, especially if we detect that the enum looks proto3 compatible (meaning: the first enum item has the value of zero).\nIt looks like the RTB enums would satisfy this rule.\nThoughts?. Ooh, I also need to thank you for the example; looks like the upcoming 2.3.0 parser needs a few more tweaks - it fails on that proto schema (see here) in two ways:\n\nit doesn't expect hex numbers, giving \"unable to parse integers\" on everything in NativeAdTemplate.Fields\nit fails to resolve Hyperlocal.Point correctly\n\nI expect both of these to be easy fixes - will have a look this evening.. The annoying problem with enums in C# is that they don't have a defined order, and in proto2 the order matters (because the first one is the default). I think the rule for automatic \"yeah, this is passthru\" should be:\n\nif [Flags] or [ProtoContract(EnumPassthru=true)] - trivial case, explicitly pass-thru\n\notherwise:\n\nif there's an enum definition with value zero\nand if there is no enum definition that has a [ProtoEnum(...)] marker with a value that is different than the enum's native value\nand if there is not a [DefaultValue(...)] on the member that gives a value other than zero\n\nthen: treat it as pass-thru\nI think that works......?. The more I think about it, the more I think we should only worry about this if there is a [ProtoEnum] with a non-matching value... i.e. do we actually need to do any mapping. If we don't: just pass it through as-is; which means at the DSL layer, both proto2 and proto3 can include this happily. It is only user-generated \"code-first\" enums that would ever have this problem.. What you say about VideoFormat is fine if we use the \"The more I think about it\" version, i.e. \"as long as we don't know that there is a conflict: use the simple rules\". This would only ever apply to \"I'm using enums that I wrote in my regular non-.proto code, and I've added ProtoEnum to remap the values\". This is a tiny edge case, and I'm OK if things are more complicated for that scenario. The default thing isn't a factor there - was just being paranoid - separate concern.\nBTW, I fixed the parser - it almost works perfectly for that .proto now - only issue is the emitted code doesn't give quite the right name - it says public Point CenterPoint { get; set; } when it should be public Hyperlocal.Point CenterPoint { get; set; }. That's a known issue (it was already in the \"Pending work items in generated code\" list) that I'll try to fix tonight.. @rstonkus \"exactly!\" - the fact that is unclear highlights how unusual a situation that is. But basically, protobuf-net supports the hypothetical situation where you have an enum:\nenum Foo {\n    A = 0, B = 17, C = 42\n}\n\nAnd for whatever reason you want to use that in a model that is (perhaps at a later date) being exposed to protobuf but where the protobuf enum has values 0, 1, 4. In that scenario you can add [ProtoEnum(Value = 1)] against B and [ProtoEnum(Value = 4)] against C, and those values will be used in the serialization. This is a very unusual scenario, and is the only one where the pass-thru would appear to be unsafe. Having a [ProtoEnum] marker by itself is fine, as is using the same value in the ProtoEnum and the .NET enum.\n. This will behave in the desired way in 2.3.0; tests (passing) have been added, etc; https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/commit/b248af6487c9baf89d199868aa72695bf60ea4fa\nThe strict mode is enabled by explicitly setting EnumPassThru to false. This looks great, thanks; I expect the next deploy will be 2.3.0 in the next week; this will be included. Much appreciated. I'll hack the csproj this evening and create a 3.5 target.

Yeah, this isn't a package reference on regular .NET; it is a framework reference. Try:\n<Reference Include=System.Xml\" />\n\nIt is, however, a package reference in .NET core. Build tools are fun :/ I have fun Condition markers to do things like this, for example in protobuf-net itself:\n<ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(ImportLibs)|$(FeatureServiceModel)' == 'net|true'\">\n    <Reference Include=\"System.ServiceModel\" />\n    <Reference Include=\"System.Configuration\" />\n    <Reference Include=\"System.Runtime.Serialization\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(ImportLibs)' == 'core'\">\n    <!-- could make this more granular to respect the options, but no need yet -->\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.Emit\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.TypeExtensions\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Xml.XmlSerializer\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\nHowever, I'm slightly confused because IIRC System.Xml is actually included by default. Sheesh.\nThe fact is the build tools are a bit of a mess right now (for .NET / .NET core generally, not this library specifically). It is causing me pain on a number of projects. Fixes are in the pipelines, but are outside of my control.. If you're targetting .NET 3.5, then it is System.Xml 2.0; .NET 3.5 are incremental additions to .NET 2.0 via additional assemblies; the base assembles do not change (except for bugfixes etc, but they didn't increase the major version).\nBecause System.Xml.Linq is one of those additions in .NET 3.5, it gets the 3.5 versioning; however System.Xml: does not - it stays 2.0\nIn .NET 4.0, they all become 4.0.. AFAIK (and I'm happy to be corrected): System.Xml 3.5 does not exist.. at least, not in regular .NET. If it exists in some Mono / Unity / whatever branch, then fine.. Closing issue; 2.3.0 will include 2.0 and 3.5 builds via the \"VS\" configuration (that only works in VS, hence the name). What is \"it\" in this context? What specifically are you looking for? Are you talking about the DSL parsing tools (protogen)? And if so, are you talking about the old version, or are you talking about the version that I'm working on for the 2.3.0 release? If you aren't talking about the DSL parsing tools... what do you mean?\nPlease be specific so I can address your question.. I'm happy to investigate, but I really need it to be clearer what you are after. Please could you explain more, otherwise I'll have to close it as unclear.. there is a brand new \"protogen\" tool in the \"parser\" branch, scheduled for\nrelease with 2.3.0\nOn 19 Jun 2017 12:16 a.m., \"\u8c22\u96c4\u5e73\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI am sorry for replay so late.\nYes, \"it\" is the DLS (protogen).\nI will try the version,thanks.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/263#issuecomment-309309342,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AABDsNIt4oLt-S8zRffyI7J-3fciLsg6ks5sFa-zgaJpZM4N5VNH\n.\n.

I'm going to make this part of the 2.3.1 milestone; 2.3.0 is pretty much wrapped - I'm just doing regression / test suite updates (see PR #265); have updated the branch release notes (will hit master when I've finished the regression test): https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/parser/docs/releasenotes.md. note: what I'll probably do is : when I've finished everything I want for 2.3.0, I'll take a look at this - if it falls out easily, it'll move into 2.3.0 - otherwise I'll ship 2.3.0 and look at it as a separate piece of work\n\nnote to self: also implement protogen --include_source_info. Yes, it probably should; will target for 2.3.0. It surprises me that you've hit this, as this should only impact the runtime-only (reflection etc) implementation. Are you running on UWP or similar, by any chance? Anyway, fixed for 2.3.0. K; I can switch to .FullName which solves a lot of this (it expands generics), but do you have a minimal repro that I can use to validate? My attempt at a repro shows the concrete type name, not the interface; would really like to validate. fixed in 2.3.0. d'oh! you're absolutely right; fix applied to code, will be in 2.3.0 (which is in package prep). fixed in 2.3.0. Do you have an illustration of what your callback signature looks like? And you mention silver light: I'll be honest : it is increasingly hard to support silverlight, and many of the tools I need to build and test for that aren't tools that I have installed usually. If the fix requires a build (rather than a fix of your signature): it is going to be gnarly.. I would say that is the correct deserialization - protobuf (the google\nspec) is designed such that data is appended, not replaced.\nThe good news is that there are two ways to fix this:\n1) don't run the initializer during deserialization - you do this by adding\nSkipConstructor = true to the [ProtoContract]\n2) tell protobuf-net to not interpret the list data as append; add\nOverwriteList = true to the [ProtoMember]\nEither of these should achieve what you want\nOn 25 Jun 2017 12:22 p.m., \"vmas\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSample (protobuf-net 2.2.1):\n[ProtoContract]\nclass A\n{\n    public A() { Values = new int[5]; }\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic int[] Values { get; set; }\n\n}\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n     A a, b;\n     a = new A();\n     a.Values[0] = 5;\n using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n {\n     Serializer.Serialize(ms, a);\n     ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n     b = Serializer.Deserialize<A>(ms);\n }\n Console.WriteLine(\"Sizes: {0}, {1}\", a.Values.Length, b.Values.Length);\n\n}\nAfter deserialization b.Values contains 10 elements instead 5.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/273, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AABDsPKT1O_uQ3AdYAJzKyFWjzUFrIDeks5sHkLbgaJpZM4OElLh\n.\n. K, this is a complex one.\n\nCurrently, the support for .net native and UWP / AOT etc is limited. As back-story, historically there is a precompilation tool for protobuf-net that allows limited cross-platform pre-compilation of the IL pieces. This kinda worked, but was awkward, ugly, really hard to support, and just generally messy. Additionally, this is going to be a nightmare as we add \"async\" (on the roadmap).\nI don't think that is the way to go in the future, although the google code download still has the bits for this.\nI have repeatedly been talking with MS and other folks re better ways of doing code-gen for this and other scenarios, for two different needs - the code-first approach and the contract-first approach. There are a range of plans to improve what is available here in the mid-range future. Basically the plan is to split the non-IL pieces (the reader/writer, etc) into \"protobuf-net.Core\" or similar. Projects would target the .Core project if they have generated C#, or both .Core and protobuf-net if they want to use the runtime emitter. The idea being that AOT scenarios would fall into the first camp.\nAt the moment, though, that mostly doesn't exist.\nIn the r668 world there is a core-only project that uses reflection. We could probably resurrect that short term, but the performance won't be anything to shout about.\nSo: are you looking for something today?

There are a few things that make this more awkward when starting from interfaces. Firstly, we can't just serialize it as a Class1 - it would need to be wrapped appropriately, which would mean any interface members at the root level, which would then probably end up being duplicated at the type level (because people would forget to exclude them), which is especially problematic for lists / arrays.\n\nSecondly, it is very hard to deal with interfaces as the root object, since when using GetType() you lose the declared type and only have the concrete type. This would potentially make it serialize differently per context, which is very awkward. Likewise when the class type is used directly without mention of the interface.\nThis scenario is a lot more nuanced then is obvious. It would need very clear consideration as to how it would behave in a range of scenarios including (but not limited to) these cases.. > Can you explain why that is the case for an interface but not the case for a class that extends a base class?\nIt is the case for a base-class / sub-class. The difference is that a subclass doesn't usually re-declare (new etc) the same properties that the base class had. Most interface implementations, however: do.\n\nIsn't this a good thing? You simply serialise it as a the concrete type which in my example is what I would like it to do.\n\nit cannot simply be serialized as the concrete type - that will not work in any way. During deserialization it needs to know what type to deserialize. Serializing it as the type itself includes zero such metadata, so you'd be thinking IFoo and seeing data for Bar, but with no clue that it is a Bar. This is why it needs wrapping in the first place.\n\nWell yes, because its an interface it would serialise as whatever the underlying object is. Wouldn't that be what most people expect?\n\nSee above.\nThe aim is fine, but it isn't as simple as just serializing as the concrete type. As I say: any approach here would need very clear ideas of what should happen (ideally in terms of the data protocol) in each case.. No. The problem is that the serialization of a Foo does not include anything that says \"I'm a Foo\".\nIf we did that, then during deserialization: how do you know what it should be?. A lot of the code does use exactly GetType() etc. That doesn't change he nature of the problem in any way. Types don't change their members, so it doesn't matter when we check if it will be the same shape either way.. Because this stuff is nuanced :)\nThere are 3 different scenarios here, and we'd need to know how each should behave:\n\nroot objects via generic usage such as Serialize<T> uses typeof(T) IIRC\nroot objects via non-generic usage may or may not have a type specified\nmembers inside types know the member's type\n\nFrankly, I don't think the problem that you're trying to solve is very clear at the moment. And the key point is: it isn't enough to serialize - we also need to be able to deserialize knowing just the interface.. Indeed, but we start getting into problems.\nConsider: in order to serialize such a model, we need to find the logical root, which in this case probably is the interface - so: imagine we have:\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(Foo))]\ninterface IFoo {\n   [ProtoMember(1)] int Id {get;set;}\n}\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(Bar))]\nclass Foo : IFoo {\n    public int Id {get;set;}\n    // ...\n}\n[ProtoContract]\nclass Bar : Foo { ... }\n\nSo far so good. If we see a Bar, we need to build the model. Currently we just look at the .BaseType, which is simple and readily available - we find Foo, notice that there is an \"include\" and note that Bar's logical root is Foo, and we start from there.\nSo; let's say we want to fully support interfaces. Now we need to look not just at the .BaseType of each level, but also at the interfaces implemented by each level - and check them for \"include\" directives. In theory that's fine - we can find IFoo easily enough and determine that IFoo is the logical root for Foo and Bar.\nNote that this is not the same as just serializing the concrete type - we need to start at the logical root in order to be able to deserialize correctly (we need to identify the correct type). This is one of the key points I was trying to call out earlier, although perhaps that is largely an implementation detail (it is a very important one). It would also be necessary to observe that adding an interface using this kind of \"include\" approach is fundamentally a breaking serialization change in the same way that adding a new base-type (with \"include\") is a breaking serialization change. But it can probably work - it just doesn't today.\nIt gets more complex, though - we'd need to think about what scenarios we don't support and how to message the user. For example:\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(SomeType))]\ninterface IFoo {...}\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(SomeType))]\ninterface IBar {...}\n\n[ProtoContract]\nclass SomeType : IFoo, IBar { ... }\n\nThis doesn't have a sensible common root, and cannot be supported. Then we get into interfaces implementing interfaces (IFoo : IBar), etc. Should that work? \nThis is probably fine, for example:\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(IBar))]\ninterface IFoo {...}\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(SomeType))]\ninterface IBar : IFoo {...}\n[ProtoContract]\nclass SomeType : IBar { ...}\n\nBut what if we get to the same concrete type via multiple paths?\n\nWe also get into fun scenarios around unknown data and different versions of the contract; this is mostly the same scenario that we already have today for abstract classes, so it isn't drastically a new problem - but it is one that needs consideration\n\nI guess the point I'm getting at here is that this is a complex problem. It isn't impossible to do it - but rather, it needs serious consideration and design and testing - plus of course whatever changes it needs to implement it, and document it, and update any now-wrong documents/questions on the topic, and fix any code regressions, and update any tests that now fail incorrectly because of the changes, and support these changes at every point in the future. We can't just shoe-horn it in with a 5 line hack. And before I take on significant pieces of work, I like to understand why we're doing it - i.e. what use case it supports that can't already be supported in other ways. Ultimately, time spent working on this is time not spent working on other code, so it is all a juggling act re how to spend resources (mostly: my time). It seems to me that everything here can already be achieved via a DTO layer. I'm not saying we can't do it, but I'd really want to explore what the compelling example is for doing it.. In the example you give, during deserialization, how would the code know to select SomeType? what members are serialized? are the members on IFoo serialized? or just those on SomeType? What happens if the list contains multiple different IFoo implementations? Why is SomeType tested for, specifically? What happens if there aren't any known IFoo implementations? What happens if I serialize a SomeType instance by itself? Does that look the same as an IFoo that was a SomeType? Does a List<SomeType> look identical to a List<IFoo>?\nThese are the questions that I'd need to get to the bottom of.. > When you start deserialising you know what you are deserialising due to the ProtoMember numbers in the data don't you? So from these you can infer the type that was serialised eg in this case SomeClass?\nHow? where did that number come from? If we take your specfic example: where would it get such a number from? The only possible place is a [ProtoInclude] on the interface,  which takes us back to the more complex scenario that I strongly suspect is the only way to do it.\n\nWhen you start the deserialization process and you receive the memberNumber do you not look up the class of this member number? I'm not sure how this problem is unique to interfaces.\n\nThe member number only tells us that we're talking about the ListOfIFoo member.. If you mean \"treat all IFoo as though they were SomeType, and fail if one isn't, and just use SomeType during deserialization\"... then frankly I think it should be a List<SomeType>.... > It would get the number from SomeClass, it would never look at anything about the interface implementation.\nThat just tells us to expect IFoo. We don't know about SomeType from that\n\nUpon deserialisation you check every single object Is An IFoo and cast it to IFoo\n\nI think the key thing you're missing here is context on how deserialization works and what data the protobuf stream contains. The ultimate problem is: the data in the raw stream doesn't tell us what type of object to create. A List<Blah> when deserialized doesn't create Blah instances \"because the data tells us to\". Rather, it creates Blah instances because it is deserializing a List<Blah>. As such, it interprets the data (which is otherwise unadorned) using the rules for Blah. So: you can't just deserialize and then cast to IFoo - we need to know what to actually do with the data that we see. This is what the \"logical root / include\" approach of protobuf-net does - it defines a set of conventions for interpreting an inheritance based model.. K; the way protobuf-net encodes that is essentially (to use .proto syntax):\nmessage DTO {\n    repeated BaseClass listOfBase  = 5;\n}\nmessage BaseClass {\n    optional ExtendsBase1 _eb1 = 1;\n    optional ExtendsBase2 _eb2 = 2;\n}\nmessage ExtendsBase1 {\n    optional string Test3 = 3;\n}\nmessage ExtendsBase2 {\n    optional string Test4 = 4;\n}\n\nwhere exactly zero or one of _eb1 / _eb2 are assigned a value (this could also use oneof in recent .proto versions). The sub-classes are mapped as inner objects, and the sub-class data always comes first. In JSON terms (although it isn't JSON - this is purely for example purposes), an object would look something like:\n{\n   \"_eb1\": {\n    \"Test3\": \"foo\"\n  }\n}\n\nDuring deserialization, we start with a null reference, and start resolving fields, and only create the instance when required (because of data fields, or at the end of any deserialization path). Since the first actual data we get is the \"Test3\", it is at that point that we create the instance, which we know by the context should be a ExtendsBase1. If neither _eb1 or eb2 had a value, then we'd create a BaseClass instance on the way out (or when some data in that context was encountered, but there aren't any other fields in this case).\n\nMy point in the comment yesterday is that we could apply this same logic to interfaces, within certain constraints - mainly around the topics of multiple inheritance (resolving to contract types) would be disallowed.\nSo essentially, it could be mapped with the interface as the root type:\nmessage IFoo {\n    optional SomeType _st = 1;\n    optional SomeOtherType _sot = 2;\n}\n\nwhich would map to:\n[ProtoContract]\n[ProtoInclude(1, typeof(SomeType))]\n[ProtoInclude(2, typeof(SomeOtherType))]\ninterface IFoo {...}\n\nThis would allow us to deserialize an IFoo into any of the known / expected concrete types. This obviously has the issue that if no expected type is found in the data, then it can't instantiate - but that's actually the same problem we get for abstract base classes today, so that's not a new restriction..

The interesting challenges re inheritance aren't when you know what the concrete type is. They are when you don't know - and only know about the base type. From what I can see, this code will only work in the \"we know what the exact actual type will be\" scenario. This is indeed a valid scenario, but is the small %, not the large %.\n\nIs this the intention? Have I misunderstood?. No, I mean when you don't know what the derived type is. For example, with :\nVehicle\nRoadVehicle : Vehicle\nCar : RoadVehicle\nBike : RoadVehicle\nTrain : Vehicle\n\nAnd all you know to expect is a Vehicle. Ultimately this is the problem that ProtoInclude solves via root-based serialization. What you have is leaf-based serialization, which only works for specific types - it would be fine if you know to expect a Car, for example.\nIs this an intentional limitation?. closing as duplicate of #289 (technically this one was first obviously, but status update is already in 289). Yes, I saw the two questions (One of them even has or had a bounty, which is awesome).

In the C#, I assume that is a System.DateTime, not your own DateTime message? In which case indeed: the way that protobuf-net will encode that System.DateTime is not the same as your DateTime message in the .proto\n\nGood news: fixable.\nOptions:\n\nif you need to keep the DateTime from your .proto, you can do that but you'll need to create a .NET type that looks like that - presumably simply by running your .proto through protogen (https://protogen.marcgravell.com is the easiest way to do this)\nalternatively, use google.protobuf.Timestamp, the \"well known\" mechanism to express date/time info - protobuf-net supports this, including protogen (you'll need to import \"google/timestamp.proto\") and code-first (use DataFormat.WellKnown on that property); note that this option replaces the DateTime you've defined in your .proto and will change the data - and the change needs to be shared between all callers\n\nOther options exist, but those are the simplest. Note: if you have existing protobuf-net data that was serialized with the class shown, and you want to deserialize that in another client - then: it gets harder. Until relatively recently there was no \"well known\" format for dates/times, so protobuf-net invented one. Unfortunately the representation it used is not the one that got chosen, and is awkward to use from other clients. There is a .proto for it, though - see bcl.proto / DateTime: https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/master/src/Tools/bcl.proto\nIf possible, when using cross-platform clients, I suggest moving to the new \"well known\" formats for dates/times, but: this is fundamentally incompatible with any existing data stored using the bcl.proto approach.. thats very odd; I will need to take a look, but that \"actual\" indeed looks\nvery unlikely\nOn 10 Aug 2017 8:13 a.m., \"mizuno-gsinet\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI have encountered the following problem:\nusing System.Collections.Generic;using ProtoBuf;using ProtoBuf.Meta;\nnamespace ProtobufNetTest\n{\n    [ProtoContract(IgnoreListHandling = true)]\n    public class Inner : List\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)]\n        public int Int { get; set; }\n    }\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class Outer\n{\n    [ProtoMember(1)]\n    public bool Bool { get; set; }\n\n    public Inner Inner { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var typeModel = TypeModel.Create();\n        typeModel.UseImplicitZeroDefaults = false;\n\n        typeModel.Add(typeof(Outer), true)\n            .AddField(2, \"Inner\");\n        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine(typeModel.GetSchema(typeof(Outer), ProtoSyntax.Proto3));\n    }\n}\n\n}\nExpected output:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\npackage EFTest;\nmessage Inner {\n   int32 Int = 1;\n}\nmessage Outer {\n   bool Bool = 1;\n   Inner Inner = 2;\n}\nActual output:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\npackage EFTest;\nmessage Outer {\n   bool Bool = 1;\n   repeated int32 Inner = 2 [packed = false];\n}\nOf course, this is not my actual usage, but I really miss this behavior.\nAm I missing some points?\nThank you.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/297, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AABDsPSg0TBjkN7Mw0IehmpvKie3VB4Bks5sWq21gaJpZM4OzCEd\n.\n.

The \"precompile\" hack is... a massive PITA for\neveryone.\nLet me think on that.\nOn 22 October 2017 at 14:41, sophiepeithos notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nok\uff0cusing the precompile from r668 seems ok on windows, I can successfully\nserialization and deserialization proto3 map.\nbut It throw an exception when running precompile on macos:\nhuis-MacBook-Pro:precompile hui$ mono precompile.exe Model.dll -o:1.dll\n-t:a WARNING: The runtime version supported by this application is\nunavailable.

The \"assorted\"\nis stuff that has not been updated to the current build tools, so may not\nbe in an immediately buildable state. In the case of precompile, this is\npartly because the tool we use to hack around some platform limitations\n(IKVM) has been abandoned by the author. But also, it has always been\nsomewhat brittle and hacky. The library that is available for earlier\nbuilds seems incompatible with .net core etc, and frankly that simply isn't\nthe right tool to pursue going forward.\nLong term, the plan is to replace this tool with better build-like tooling\nperhaps using Roslyn, perhaps not. I've been chasing MS on improved build\ntime generation, and while folks see the need nothing has changed. The\nexperimental \"generators\" Roslyn spike is stalled.\nSo; right now I don't have good options for pre-generation, at least: not\nfor recent builds. If you're using an older build, then the old precompile\nexe should work.\nOther than that, I would need to dust off a lot of pieces to plumb\neverything together. It isn't something that I need day to day, which -\nbeing realistic - has influenced my prioritization. If I needed it for\nwork, it would be relatively easy to carve out some work time to get the\njob done - but otherwise, I'm kinda kept busy on other things.\nI am aware that this is a pain point - and I've seen various people talking\nabout unity in particular. Here again I am slightly hampered by not being a\nunity user. I don't know much about the platform limitations. What I guess\nI need to do is find the time to carve out some R+D time to set up a\nminimal unity project and try to see for myself what happens, and what I\ncan get working.\nWhat version(s) / platforms of unity are you hitting problems with?

The test project didn't contain comparisons to protobuf-csharp-port, so it\nis hard for me to comment, but my initial thought is: the google\nimplementation does a lot of the serialization work in the builder, so if\nyou aren't measuring object construction time and object query time - that\nis probably a huge part of the difference. The MS impl is a more\nfeature-parity comparison. I've tidied up some glitches in the code (let me\nknow if you want the revised .cs back), and I get data like:\n\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1594 deser:1531 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1172 deser:2156 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1625 deser:2047 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1437 deser:3391 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1594 deser:1531 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1156 deser:2250 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1610 deser:1531 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1156 deser:2250 len:432\nTest1 (MS.LiveLabs) ser:1609 deser:1532 len:442\nTest2 (protobuf-net) ser:1156 deser:2172 len:432\nGeneral conclusions, then: at the moment, protobuf-net on the data is\nfaster at serialization, but slightly slower on deserialization.\nInvestigating the exact time is tricky, and I can't give an immediate\nanswer on that, but it is something I can look at to see if there's a\n\"trick\" I can do here.

Another random thought; is it possible that your string has a trailing nul? That would result in:\n(blah...)-12-09-73-6F-6D-65-43-69-74-79-00\n(in partcular, note the 12-09-...-00) - note that this is still perfectly valid protobuf, and if this is what the scenario is, I would say that protostuff has a string-reading bug - sounds unlikely, though.\n. I'm assuming this is \"SOLNA\" ?\nAgreed: tag 90 is field-number 11. Just to check: is there a field 11 in\nyour message?

The first thing it\nreads, inside this nested message, is buffer position 202: 7.

So to be clear, then; what makes you think there is a problem? The 9 bytes in the binary you posted most recently says:\n\"field 11, string, length 7\" (2 bytes)\n    \"field 3, string, length 5\" (2 bytes)\n        \"SOLNA\" (5 bytes)\nIf field 11 is a location with Coordinate = null, Accuracy = 0 and City = \"SOLNA\", then that is entirely reasonable. So: what makes you think there is an issue? What is the symptom? \n. From your comment here:\n\nThe first thing it reads, inside this nested message, is buffer position 202: 7. It uses the two lines above making tag=7 and therefore fieldNumber=0.\n\nwhat you are describing here is a bug in protostuff; a tag with value 90 indicates a length-prefixed type (aka \"string\"). The correct thing to do next is to read a varint, which indicates the length of the content - in this case, 7 bytes. The content starts after the 7. If protostuff isn't reading the varint that denotes the length: then it is doing it wrong. You can refer to the \"Strings\" and \"Embedded Messages\" sections of the encoding spec for more information.\n. Step back; what are these 3 different DLLs? What is the difference between\nthem?

Ah, this is probably the annoying \"implicit defaults\" - an early design choice that is much regretted. Try adding:\n[DefaultValue(true)]\nTo the property. That should hopefully fit it.\n. This is simply a poor design choice that happened many many years ago in v1 of protobuf-net. What I should have done is only use explicit default values. How the code was implemented - and remains the default, for compatibility - is that it assumes \"zero\" as the default, unless told otherwise (or unless some kind of conditional serialization is in play, for example Nullable-of-T, ShouldSerialize, or Specified). There is actually an option to disable this if you create your own RuntimeTypeModel instance rather than using .Default - something like \".UseImplicitZeroDefaults\".\nThe [DefaultValue(true)] in this case simply gives the library more clue as to what is an actual value vs a default.\n. the fundsmental thing here is that the .proto schema proessing needs a\nsingnificant overhaul (read: rewrite) in order to be viable in the\nxplat/core-clr world.

As noted, there is support to disable enum verification, and this is done automatically if [Flag] is on the enum.

Do you mean System.Runtime.Serialization.EnumMemberAttribute? If so: indeed - it is a string. I believe there is a ProtoEnumAttribute in the protobuf namespace that should do what you want.\n. The current build makes no attempt to TryParse etc the enum values,\nbecause in the general case, it is not expected that they will have\nnumeric values in EnumMemberAttribute attributes. Dapper treats enums as\ninteger types. However, can I ask: do you actually need to do anything\nhere? normally, enums serialize just fine without any extra work. And there\nare ways such as [Flags] to get it to treat it as a raw number without\nenum handling at all. Finally, there is always runtime model configuration.\nAre any of those options useful to you?\nOn 21 April 2015 at 00:00, mrent notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYes, the serialization EnumMember.

I don't think we can just enable this - it is a breaking change, especially for people who expect the data output to be reproducible. To merge this, I would want to make this \"opt-in\", perhaps via a global setting, so that it doesn't adversely impact other users. If it was in from day zero, that would be different.\nThoughts?\n. Note: it is fine to always process during deserialization as long as the old default is preserved: it is only during serialization that we need to check a flag \n. I need to look more at the arrays - yes my main concern was the date times\n. I'm fully aware of the aim that parsers should ignore unknown fields; but\nI'm also aware that many people expect the output to remain consistent -\nand I know of a few implementations that this change would actively break\n(for example, when using the output as \"set\" values in things like redis).\nIt would also break a lot of peoples' tests that assert \"the output of this\ninput is this binary\". Hence why I feel it should be made opt-in. Does that\nmake sense?\nOn 4 May 2015 5:09 pm, \"Rob Taylor\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for taking a look.

I'm fairly new to protobuf but on\nhttps://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding it mentions\nthat \"When the message is being decoded, the parser needs to be able to\nskip fields that it doesn't recognize.\". In the event where someone was\nusing a library that wasn't the protobuf-net library (or if they were using\na version of protobuf-net without this fix) wouldn't the parser just skip\nthe DateTimeKind field and the behaviour would be as it currently is with\nthe DateTimeKind not being serialized?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/pull/82#issuecomment-98768146.\n. good question; my initial thought is possibly via an instance property on\nRuntimeTypeModel, like how AllowParseableTypes works; however, what we'd\nprobably need to do is:\n- add a new overload to BclHelpers.WriteDateTime that accepts a boolean\n  to indicate whether to include the kind\n- forward the old WriteDateTime to WriteDateTime(value,dest,false);\n- optional: mark the old overload as [Obsolete]\n- change the DateTimeSerializer code in both Write and EmitWrite to include\n  the extra parameter (and in the case of EmitWrite: to select the correct\n  method, which could perhaps be done by making EmitWrite ignore methods\n  where [Obsolete] is defined)\n\nThe point of this lot is due to the ability of protobuf-net to generate\nserialization assemblies; we don't want old serialization assemblies to\nbreak with MissingMethodException, and we want newly generated\nserialization assemblies to respect the options that were set on their\nRuntimeTypeModel.\nThat lot probably isn't trivial, though - and depends on reflection/IL\nknowledge.

But that is largely unrelated to the issue. As I tried to explain, the problem is not about deserialization (indeed, I mentioned that deserialization wouldn't even need to check any config option)  but: serialization, and the effects of suddenly changing the output of the serialization process between versions. I also tried to outline several of the scenarios that I actively know about that would be impacted by this. People reasonably expect the binary data to change if they add fields etc, but not unexpectedly from this; the path of least failure is thus to make it an opt-in configuration option.\nI'm sorry if this has caused you frustration, but I need to consider all users.\n. The redis scenario was simply one of many that immediately leapt to mind re people not expecting the same data to serialise to different bytes today vs tomorrow. And technically, that would most likely be a value not a key.\n\nFrom my point of view the only requirement the library should support is... \"The protobuf-net library must be able to deserialize protobuf strings serialized by older versions.\"\n\n\"don't unexpectedly change the output\" is also a key requirement. And one that can be accommodated at the same time by making it a configurable option.\n\nbut as a user it would be frustrating having to set various obscure options in order to have the library work correctly\n\nI understand your point - and sure, if this were day zero, it would be great to include this from the start, but: it wasn't, and because I need to support existing users, I can't just change this blindly. I think it is a posititive change, but it needs to be done with appropriate consideration for known scenarios.\nI'm still trying to stabilise the CoreCLR branch, but once that is in, I'll see if I can bring these things together. But if I do: there will be a configuration setting.\nIt makes me wonder if there's some kind of \"compatibility profile\" that could be devised - heck, I'd nuke implicit zero defaults at the same time... but I wonder if rather than setting lots of individual properties, setting some kind of CompatilibilityOption = {version}. That is mainly rhetorical and probably isn't very thoroughly thought through yet.\n.

Actually, there is something you can do here if and only if the additional data is a direct child of the original root object. For example: if the original is:\n\nFoo {\n    a = 1;\n    b = 2;\n    repeated c = 3;\n}\nThe protobuf format is both:\n- appendable (append===merge)\n- not required to be in order\nThis means that you can actually drop the \"b\" part (for example) onto the wire separately from the rest, simply by appending it correctly. To append with the right headers, the easiest thing to do is to create a dummy object with just the b:\nFooBOnly {\n    b = 2;\n}\nNow you can:\n- serialize a Foo that doesn't include a \"b\"\n- serialize a FooBOnly with a \"b\"\nWhen the receiver seaerializes as Foo, it will merge both parts automatically.\nAny use?\n.

I don't think it is a good idea to leak the actual ioBuffer, because that is leased from the BufferPool -  basically:\n- the contents might have been changed completely by another caller by the time the recpient sees it\n- it would allow the recipient to screw up someone else's ioBuffer\n\nI'd be fine with adding context about the position, length, etc... but the ioBuffer: probably not a good idea\n. I would also question the usefulness; it isn't like xml and json - most people won't have a clue how to interpret the data.\n. the only way to safely do that would be to grab the data from the ioBuffer before adding it to the exception, so the only thing you're adding is isolated; however, protobuf is a binary format, and in the general case we should not expect it to be likely to contain text\n. ioBuffer can be pretty huge, though - I would advise only copying (say) a max of 100 bytes either side of where it exploded (would need some min/max checks, etc); additionally, note that you should only look at most at the known available bytes - anything past that point is potentially garbage and unrelated to the current problem: it would be unnecessarily confusing to report that as though it were part of the problem, when it isn't.\nFinally, in terms of allocation and large blocks, this isn't ideal - it kinda feels like this should be opt-in (although it is fine if the message says \"enable ShowBufferContentsInExceptions to view the data at the time of the error\", or something like that)\n. I'm confused - you've opened and closed within an hour; was this mistaken?\n. Is it possible that any thread is changing the list contents at this\ntime?

Thanks\n. Protobuf-net needs to know numbers for each field you want to serialize. There are ways to make this semi-automated, but the easiest way would be to explicitly mark them:\n```\n[DataMember(Order=1)]\npublic string ABC {get;set;}\n[DataMember(Order=2)]\npublic int QWE {get;set;}\n```\nThat should fix it.\n. Well, in this scenario the first thing I'd note is that using implementation details (such as Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Entity) in serialization layers is not a great idea - it creates a huge number of traps. Frankly, if serialization of an existing object model becomes non-trivial, the best approach is not \"fight the serializer\" but rather \"create a simple DTO that fits the serializer perfectly\"\nAs it happens, protobuf-net does have things like ImplicitFields that can help in some of these scenarios, but it only looks at the declaring type, not base-types - so it wouldn't pull from Entity. protobuf-net also has the ability to configure types manually, but that would require you adding code to your app-init. But to give an example broadly similar to yours:\n```\nusing ProtoBuf;\nusing ProtoBuf.Meta;\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        RuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(MyObj), false).Add(\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Name\");\n        var obj = new MyObj { Name = \"abc\", Foo = 123, Bar = \"def\" };\n        var clone = Serializer.DeepClone(obj);\n        Console.WriteLine(obj);\n        Console.WriteLine(clone);\n    }\n}\n[DataContract] public class MyObj : Entity {\n    [DataMember] public string Name { get; set; }\n    public override string ToString() => $\"{Name}, {Foo}, {Bar}\";\n}\n[DataContract] public class Entity {\n    [DataMember] public int Foo { get; set; }\n    [DataMember] public string Bar { get; set; }\n}\n```\nNote here that the order of the members in Add defines their wire identity - so Foo is 1, Bar is 2, etc. Depending on your C# version, you may also wish to look at nameof rather than hard-coded strings:\nRuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(MyObj), false).Add(\n            nameof(Entity.Foo), nameof(Entity.Bar), nameof(MyObj.Name));\nIs any of that useful?\n. Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.AttributeCollection is basically a\nDictionary, which protobuf-net is going to hate. The\nprotobuf format is designed to serialize models with a well-known shape /\nformat - which \"object\" isn't. There is no good way to handle a\nstring-object map in protobuf; there are some bad ways, but that depends a\nlot on what the actual values are in your scenario.\n. The problem isn't the map - protobuf-net would happily support\nDictionary<string,Project>, to use the example from your links; it is the\n\"object\". Protobuf wants to know what it is deserializing. So again: what\nare the actual values?\nOn 7 March 2016 at 09:14, rebulanyum notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWell it's just a collection with items of type KeyValuePair. Right?

But\nfundamentally, I would again simply suggest that anything based on this\nmuch implementation details rather than data details isn't a good choice\nfor serialization.

K; I've fixed the library to stop it exploding, but the fundamental problem here is that a type (to protobuf-net) can either be a leaf or a list, not both; in being enumerable of itself, it tries to be both. The code isn't going to like the \"list\" style (it ... just doesn't parse), so it now reverts to \"leaf\". This will, however, mean that to get this to behave as you expect, you will need to still expose the downstream tree; this could be done by:\n\n[ProtoMember(3)] // or whatever\nprotected List<TreeObject> _children =\n. Note: to fix this using the existing library, you should be able to do:\n[ProtoContract(IgnoreListHandling = true)]\nclass Problematic : IEnumerable\n{\n    [ProtoMember(3)] // or whatever\n    protected List<TreeObject> _children =\nhere the IgnoreListHandling is checked before the code that is currently causing it to explode.\n. The problem here is that it grarually becomes prohibitively and\ndisproportionately time consuming to support older runtimes. For context,\nMS .NET 4.51 support ended over a year ago (\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/08/07/moving-to-the-net-framework-4-5-2/\n).\nThis is especially challenging given the changes to the build process etc.\nWhich needs another overhaul for the csproj changes, but that's another\nstory.\nThe long and short, then, will be:\n\nif I do the csproj changes (imminent) and the old versions \"just work\"\n(meaning: fall into place without me going crazy), then great: I'll include\nthem\notherwise, if someone can figure out what the csproj and build changes\nare to make it successfully target those versions without causing problems,\nthen a PR will be gratefully received and merged\n\nHistorically I have tried to consider back-level - heck, it even used to\ncompile on C#1.2 (.Net 1.1), and might still do so! But: there comes a time\nwhen it isn't the best use of my time to try to do so.\nI also have concerns that continuing to support these very very old\nruntimes is me being an \"enabler\" when what I should actually be doing is\nadvocating for you to move to an up to date framework.\nOn 27 Jan 2017 5:32 p.m., \"Artem Kravchenko\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nThe same problem (.NET 3.5)\nCould not install package 'protobuf-net 2.1.0'.

So I set up a minimal asp.net core site, used install-package protobuf-net (it picked up 2.1.0), added some protobuf-net code, and... it simply worked. Cannot repro the issue. Please can you give more context about what you're doing. In particular, if you are using any indirect tooling (things that reference protobuf-net), check that either they have been updated, or that you have an assembly binding redirect (which should be added automatically when you install from nuget).\n\nFor completeness, here's the code I added to the /Home/About route of the default asp.net core app:\n```\n    [ProtoContract]\n    public class Foo\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)]\n        public string Bar { get; set; }\n    }\n    public IActionResult About()\n    {\n        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            Serializer.Serialize(ms, new Foo { Bar = \"hello world\" });\n            ArraySegment buffer;\n            if (!ms.TryGetBuffer(out buffer)) throw new InvalidOperationException();\n        ViewData[\"Message\"] = BitConverter.ToString(\n            buffer.Array, buffer.Offset, buffer.Count);\n    }\n    return View();\n}\n\n```\nand here's the PMC:\nPM> install-package protobuf-net\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration1-gz/protobuf-net/index.json\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration1-gz/protobuf-net/index.json 136ms\nRetrieving package 'protobuf-net 2.1.0' from 'nuget.org'.\n  GET https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/protobuf-net/2.1.0/protobuf-net.2.1.0.nupkg\n  OK https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/protobuf-net/2.1.0/protobuf-net.2.1.0.nupkg 459ms\nInstalling protobuf-net 2.1.0.\nInstalling NuGet package protobuf-net.2.1.0.\nSuccessfully installed 'protobuf-net 2.1.0' to WebApplication1\nExecuting nuget actions took 1.39 sec\nTime Elapsed: 00:00:03.0723974\n. Actually, I'd used core-clr by mistake, but doing the same thing in asp.net core using .net framework also worked perfectly; minor tweak to the test code:\n```\n    public IActionResult About()\n    {\n        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            Serializer.Serialize(ms, new Foo { Bar = \"hello world\" });\n        ViewData[\"Message\"] = BitConverter.ToString(\n            ms.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)ms.Length);\n    }\n    return View();\n}\n\n```\n(TryGetBuffer vs GetBuffer())\nStill cannot repro.\n. Ah, k; an assembly binding redirect should also fix that.  I don't know if it has changed in the latest tooling, but app.config (not web.config) used to be the home for this: http://blog.rytmis.net/2016/03/29/asp-net-core-and-assembly-binding-redirects/\n.

This appears to be fixed - I think via a contributed PR at some point. Closing.. There is a pre-existing Serializer.NonGeneric.TryDeserializeWithLengthPrefix, but that takes an awkward TypeResolver; will look at the PR (and: sorry for delay, I've been.... distracted). Re \"really big integers\": that's actually part of the protobuf spec (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto):\nThe smallest tag number you can specify is 1, and the largest is 229 - 1, or 536,870,911.\n\n(unless the obsolete and undocumented \"message-set\" encoding is used, but protobuf-net doesn't support message-set encoding - it isn't even part of the formal specification, although I've reverse-engineered it and understand what it needs to look like)\nHowever, I'm happy to check to see that appropriate and useful errors are being raised.  The exception thing (base class) - yup, sounds like a bug. Will target both in 2.31. you're absolutely right, of course; either it needs to work, or it needs to fail as early as possible with a meaningful message; I've shipped 2.3.0, so I'm starting the 2.3.1 work currently (this issue is tagged for 2.3.1).. appreciated, thanks. if the main issue here is UWP, that's on the roadmap as a future item. This is an interesting one; I need to think about how this should work. The non-trivial part of the issue is that enums in protobuf are only defined for 32-bit values. However, since 2.3.0 adds much improved enum pass-thru support (consistent with proto3 runtime behaviour), it might be that we can simply treat long enums as direct pass-thru. Needs consideration. Adding to 2.3.1. The previous comment is correct, but to be more specific: because you write\nmultiple times to the same stream without rewinding/clearing the contents,\nyou are essentially concatenating all the objects into a single stream -\nso the overall length of data will be (number of objects)*(size of object).\nAs an aside, this also means it isn't a like for like performance test,\nespecially for deserialization!\nNow, protobuf is designed such that append===merge. So from protobuf's\nperspective, you have written a single object with many many key/value\npairs - most of which are duplicates. If you ever need to do what you are\ndoing here (writing multiple objects sequentially), the\nSerializeWithLengthPrefix and DeserializeWithLengthPrefix methods will help\nyou - basically they allow you to tell the system how to identify\nindividual objects. However, in your case what you should probably do is\nrewind and clear the stream between writes, so:\nfor(...) {\n    ms.Position = 0;\n    ms.Length = 0;\n// not shown: serialize to ms here\n\n}\n// read the contents of the final write:\nvar arr = ms.ToArray();\nOn 23 February 2017 at 17:38, Snarly Narwhal notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI get a SystemArgumentException: \"An item with the same key has already\nbeen added.\" when deserializing a dictionary.

This isn't a scenario that the library targets or that I intend the library to target; my advice here would be: always initialize your lists. For example\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic List<Foo> Items {get; } = new List<Foo>();\n\nprotobuf-net is fine with things like that. If you want lazier initialization, then you can do that with more nuanced getters, for example:\nprivate List<Foo> _items;\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic List<Foo> Items => items ?? (_items = new List<Foo>());\n\nwhich again: protobuf-net is fine with.\nWhen the 3.0.0 codegen code changes are a thing, it might be that this is something we can target there, but: ultimately I'm not sure this is protobuf-net's thing to do.\nNote that root-level lists are initialized, but that's a very different scenario..

This is a requirement for proto3 (you are using proto2 by default, since you don't have syntax = \"proto3\";). Fixed in 2.3.0; example output:\n```\n[global::ProtoBuf.ProtoContract()]\npublic partial class EnumFirstIsNonZero\n{\n    [global::ProtoBuf.ProtoMember(1, Name = @\"optional\")]\n    [global::System.ComponentModel.DefaultValue(Foo.A)]\n    public Foo Optional\n    {\n        get { return __pbn__Optional ??

All great extra context, thanks. Merged.. All good extra context, cheers. Merging as another interesting comparison / line in the sand - but in that outcome we'd just use Task<T> from the outset - both have the same allocation issue, and direct Task<T> is marginally faster. Odd that it is faster to wrap a ValueTask<T> into a Task<T> than to use await on the original ValueTask<T>!. If I get a chance later I'll try with float and double (without a reference wrapper) - see if there's a stack size limit where the suckage starts.. The protobuf format doesn't include field names, so the code needs some mechanism to know which members map to which field numbers in the data, and it needs to be reliable, i.e. you'll always get the same mapping - today, tomorrow, and two months from now.\n\none of the ways to do this is by annotating the object via attributes - this can be done via any of [ProtoMember], [DataMember] or [XmlElement] (in the last two cases, you will need to include the field number in the optional Order member). If you have code-generated entity models, there is also a [ProtoPartialMember] that can be added in a separate partial class file to allow you to attach numbers to members in the generated file without having to edit the generated file.\nAnother way you can do it is by asking the library to just assume that you're never going to change your type, and use the alphabetical order of the members.  You would do this via [ProtoContract(InferTagFromName = true)] - or to apply this as a more general default: RuntimeTypeModel.Default.InferTagFromNameDefault. However, this should not be done lightly - it makes your types very brittle - adding, removing or renaming members can (will) make the data unreliable.\nIndividual types can also be configured entirely manually using the RuntimeTypeModel / MetaType API in the library.\nWould any of those options suffice? If you are more specific about what issue you are facing, I can advise further.. > Please suggest something\nto repeat:\n\nWould any of those options suffice?

You haven't rewound the MemoryStream - if you are \"old school\" like me, think of VHS or audio cassettes: the MemoryStream is currently at the end, there is nothing to read. As it happens, 0 bytes is a perfectly valid length to protobuf. All you need is ms.Position = 0;.\nAdditional notes:\n\nvar dcat = Serializer.DeepClone(cat); would do all of this in one go\nthe generic Serializer.Serialize(ms, cat) and Serializer.Deserialize<Cat>(ms) API may be easier for you to use. because that isn't how you usually use streams - indeed, most streams\narent rewindable (TCP sockets, etc).

Well that's embarrassing. I suspect you're right! . Hi; for some reason all my usual github notifications got blown away, so I only noticed this because of @nathvi 's comment (I rebuilt all my notifications the other day). I will look this evening and see what's wrong.. I'm assuming that myIP is an IPEndPoint. For the purposes of testing this, I generated a random IP and am using:\n\nvar myIP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"220.5.105.207\"), 6379);\n\nThis fails in the way you describe.\nYou can see the problem here if we look at the stacktrace:\nUnhandled Exception: System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced\n   at System.Net.IPAddress.get_ScopeId()\n   at IPAddressSurrogate.op_Implicit(IPAddress value) in C:\\Users\\mgravell\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2017\\Projects\\ConsoleApp12\\ConsoleApp12\\Program.cs:line 44\nNotice that it is failing when accessing the ScopeId, and sure enough - if we forget about protobuf, and just look at myIP.ScopeId, that alone is enough to make it fail. So; let's assume we don't need that and just throw it away (remove ScopeId completely in the surrogate and operators).\nThis now (for me) fails with a complaint about no wire-value for InterNetwork. I think this is just because the surrogate feature was never intended to work with enums; if we remove all mention of AddressFamilySurrogate, the code now runs, but doesn't actually serialize anything - that's because IPAddressSurrogate has no members marked for serialization - but... on investigation, I don't think we even need IPAddressSurrogate - the only interesting property that we actually need to store is IPString - or the bytes equivalent. I'm going to stick with the string approach.\nNext I notice that the conversion operators are failing because of the null initial values - conversion operators on reference types need to handle null (usually by passing it through).\nAnd you don't seem to be storing the Port, which is essential.\nAt this point I took a step back, because I think you're making this way, way more complicated than necessary. I'm pretty sure that all you need is:\n```\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class IPEndPointSurrogate\n{\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic string Address { get; set; }\n\n[ProtoMember(2)]\npublic int Port { get; set; }\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPointSurrogate(IPEndPoint value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPointSurrogate { Address = value.Address.ToString(), Port = value.Port };\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPoint(IPEndPointSurrogate value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(value.Address), value.Port);\n\n}\n```\nwith example usage:\n```\npublic static class P\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        RuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(IPEndPoint), false)\n            .SetSurrogate(typeof(IPEndPointSurrogate));\n    var myIP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"220.5.105.207\"), 6379);\n    using (var ipStream = new MemoryStream())\n    {\n        Serializer.Serialize(ipStream, myIP);\n        ipStream.Position = 0;\n        var clone = (IPEndPoint)Serializer.Deserialize<IPEndPoint>(ipStream);\n        Console.WriteLine(clone.ToString());\n\n        // prove it worked:\n        Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(clone, myIP)); // false, different objects\n        Console.WriteLine(Equals(clone, myIP)); // true, count as equivalent\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nI'm not sure if I've answered the question, but...\nNote it will be slightly smaller if we use raw bytes intead:\n```\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class IPEndPointSurrogate\n{\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic byte[] Address { get; set; }\n\n[ProtoMember(2)]\npublic int Port { get; set; }\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPointSurrogate(IPEndPoint value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPointSurrogate { Address = value.Address.GetAddressBytes(), Port = value.Port };\n\npublic static implicit operator IPEndPoint(IPEndPointSurrogate value)\n    => value == null ? null : new IPEndPoint(new IPAddress(value.Address), value.Port);\n\n}\n``. I don't think there's much useful that protobuf-net can do for anint` - using the base serializer should probably be fine. Does it work?. IMO the problem is here:\nEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(messageString)\n\nIt isn't clear what messageString is here, but a .NET string is not a valid way to pass around raw binary (see previous blog entry).\nCan you indicate what messageString is and where it came from?\nIf you absolutely must use a string for some reason, then base-64 is your friend (Convert.ToBase64String() and Convert.FromBase64String()). Otherwise, prefer something like byte[] or Stream for raw data.\nWhat redis client are you using? StackExchange.Redis supports byte[] - anything that accepts a RedisValue can take a byte[]. Redis itself is binary-safe.. at the raw redis level, you want LRANGE ; I can't advise on ServiceStack. Basically: if you can get the original binary back, I can help. Until you have the same binary data that you wanted to store, protobuf-net doesn't stand a chance of succeeding. It sounds like your blocker is upstream of protobuf-net.\nWorst case, if the problem is that your client doesn't work with binary: base-64. I'm closing this because it doesn't sound like a protobuf-net issue, but if I've misunderstood please reopen or ping me. I think this is already fixed; hard to tell if we fixed it the same way, as all I can see in the merge is a sea of red and green; that file has changed radically in the last day. But running the \"failing\" example gives:\n```\npragma warning disable CS1591\n[global::ProtoBuf.ProtoContract(Name = @\"Test\")]\npublic partial class Test\n{\n    [global::ProtoBuf.ProtoMember(1, Name = @\"fs\", IsPacked = true)]\n    public float[] Fs { get; set; }\n}\npragma warning restore CS1591\n```\n. Very much appreciated, but already found and fixed separately, and is going to be impossible to merge. Keep 'em coming, though!. I don't currently offer that, mostly because nobody has ever asked. If you have something in mind, feel free to ping me (marc.gravell@gmail.com), ideally spelling out whether you're after:\n\na specific feature addition / tweak\nadvice and guidance\ntroubleshooting / bug report\netc\n\nNote that I have recently added a librepay account in case anyone wants to make any donations, but: that is (by definition) not intended for work-in-kind things. https://liberapay.com/protobuf-net/donate. Ultimately, the protobuf format has no mechanism to express this. I could silently ignore them; would that be preferable?. if you Deserialize<List<T>>, how would you know whether to expect the shim or not? how would it work for append-only files? if the first list you append has nulls, the second list doesn't, and the third list does again? having a different shape depending on whether there are nulls or not is a very bad idea, IMO, and is going to lead to huge injuries - the effect is non-obvious.\nIMO the real fix here is: since you know you have nulls, manually create a root object that has a list marked for nullable support, and serialize that instead. Then it is in your control, and not down to the library to make arbitrary opinionated decisions.. wow, that's pretty cute; much obliged. merged and deployed, but I notice that \"generate\" now only works once - any ideas? I can take a look later, but obviously you're more familiar. I like that the errors move to the right squigglies, btw - I'm glad I went to the trouble of tracking the full token ranges :). also: it doesn't show the generated code when there are only warnings; this may or may not be the same issue. ah, got it; if it fails with an exception, the exception is returned in the JSON but not displayed anywhere; actual bug causing it to throw was mine.

Regarding running protoc: do you actually need the includes? I am not involved in the official Google implementation, so I cannot advise on how to get protoc to behave, since that isn't my tooling. However! I do expose both protogen (the new incomplete rewrite) and protoc on my website:  https://protogen.marcgravell.com/\nRe ClaimsPrincipal; I don't know enough about that type. What do you actually need to serialize to store and rehydrate one of those? I genuinely don't know. However, protobuf-net includes features that allow you to get the serializer to automatically use a  simple DTO (serializaiton) type in place of a complex POCO object as long as you provide a method to get between them. So if you can say \"to work a ClaimsPrincipal I need to store a string, 3 integers and a boolean\" - then I can tell you how to get it to do that.. K\nOption 0:\nMy preferred option would be to serialize an object model that just doesn't have the complex non-serializable thing in it. Leave that entirely in the code that is downstream. That isn't always possible, so:\nOption 1:\nRetain your existing model, but have a shim property on your type; so while you might have:\npublic SomethingComplex ProblematicProperty {get;set;}\n\nyou could add:\n[ProtoMember(12)]\nprivate SomethingSimple ProblematicPropertySerialized {\n    get { /* convert from ProblematicProperty */ }\n    set { /* convert from value and assign into ProblematicProperty */ }\n}\n\n(and you write a SomethingSimple type that meets your needs and works with the serializer)\nhowever, I acknowledge that this also isn't always possible. In that case, you can hack around it with...\nOption 2\na surrogate - the key point here is the SetSurrogate method which expects there to be conversion operators between the two types (on the assumption that you're writing the surrogate type specifically for this purpose, so that's fine); you can see this in the runnable example below. The idea is the same, but instead of using a shim property, the library does that step for you.\nAnd to answer your question: no, don't touch ISerializable\n```\nusing ProtoBuf;\nusing ProtoBuf.Meta;\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var obj = new MyData { Id = 1, Foo = new ComplexNonSerializableClass() };\n    RuntimeTypeModel.Default.Add(typeof(ComplexNonSerializableClass), false)\n        .SetSurrogate(typeof(SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar));\n    var clone = Serializer.DeepClone(obj);\n}\n\n\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class MyData\n{\n    [ProtoMember(1)]\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    [ProtoMember(2)]\n    public ComplexNonSerializableClass Foo {get;set;}\n}\n\npublic class ComplexNonSerializableClass\n{\n     // ... real code here, obviously - although this probably isn't\n     // your type in the first place - it is probably a BCL type\n}\n\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar\n{\n    public static implicit operator SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar(ComplexNonSerializableClass other)\n    {   // ... real code here, obviously\n        return new SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar { Name = \"abc\", Whatever = 123 };\n    }\n    public static implicit operator ComplexNonSerializableClass(SimplerThingThatLooksSimilar other)\n    {\n        return new ComplexNonSerializableClass(); // ... real code here, obviously\n    }\n\n    [ProtoMember(1)]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [ProtoMember(2)]\n    public int Whatever { get; set; }\n}\n\n}\n```. I'm glad you were able to make progress; I'm going to close this, but feel free to ping me if there's something else.. The library always intends to be as compatible in every direction as possible. That is a key aim of both protobuf as a general concept, and protobuf-net as a specific implementation of protobuf.\nIn the case of DateTimeKind - this data is tagged in as an additional optional field. As you correctly assume, if an older library doesn't know what to do with that, it will just ignore it.\nNote that this is not always possible, though. As a specific example, Google added \"Timestamp\" as a common standard for storing date-time data (long after I'd written protobuf-net's DateTime representation). I plan to add Timestamp support in 2.3.0, probably doing something like:\n[ProtoMember(1, DataFormat = DataFormat.WellKnown)]\npublic DateTime When {get;set;}\n\nThis uses a different format. If there was old code that used 2.1.0 (or whatever) and had (since DataFormat.WellKnown doesn't exist yet):\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic DateTime When {get;set;}\n\nthen when this code tries to deserialize the time, it will either fail or silently come up with a nonsensical value. Ultimately, changing the DataFormat property of a member is almost always a breaking change in your data. I do not plan on changing the default DateTime / DataFormat matching, for exactly the reasons you highlight: compatibility.\nThe protobuf wire format has not changed at all, even with the addition of proto3 - so there shouldn't be any fundamentally changing ideas, at least until some hypothetical proto4; and if that happens, I would expect to add configuration options to enable this, so that nothing changes how existing code behaves. For example, if that happened, I would probably change:\npublic void Serialize<T>(Stream s, T value, ...\n\nto:\n[Obsolete(\"Please explicitly specify the protocol version; Proto2 is assumed by default\")]\npublic void Serialize<T>(Stream s, T value, ...) => Serialize<T>(s, value, ProtocolVersion.Proto2);\npublic void Serialize<T>(Stream s, T value, ProtocolVersion version, ...)\n\nif that makes sense. Basically, I will always go out of my way to avoid making it easy to fail. Which is, IMO, the entire point of a library.. I literally threw CommonCodeGenerator together as a starting point. I'm completely open to other radical ideas, although also note that CodeGenerator (the base) doesn't use that pattern at all - it may be that is the better fit for your scenario?. they're right next to the file in your own link (top post); https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/parser/src/protogen/CodeGenerator.cs. There's also [ProtoContract(EnumPassthru = true)] at the enum level. Wouldn't it make more sense for your test to just use:\n[ProtoContract(Name = @\"TestEnum\", EnumPassthru = true)]\n\n? I'm open to the idea; I'm just not sure that there's a necessity for it... and global options are almost always problematic, especially in complex systems where one bit of code expects the global option to be one way, and another bit of code expects it to be the opposite.. K; interesting thing I notice: in proto3 (and in contrast to proto2), there is a new additional paragraph that clarifies how it expects unknown enums to be handled:\n\nDuring deserialization, unrecognized enum values will be preserved in the message, though how this is represented when the message is deserialized is language-dependent. In languages that support open enum types with values outside the range of specified symbols, such as C++ and Go, the unknown enum value is simply stored as its underlying integer representation.\n\nBecause of this, I think it is entirely reasonable for proto3-based generation to automatically include EnumPassthru = true. It helps that proto3 has more sensible rules for enums that make this more ... possible.\nI notice that RTB is implicitly a proto2 schema, so the interesting question for me is: \"should we interpret this paragraph as applying retrospectively to proto2?\". And if we do: what are the consequences? Are there problems where this will be actively harmful?\nLet me have a think about that. It might be that we can magic this away completely, especially if we detect that the enum looks proto3 compatible (meaning: the first enum item has the value of zero).\nIt looks like the RTB enums would satisfy this rule.\nThoughts?. Ooh, I also need to thank you for the example; looks like the upcoming 2.3.0 parser needs a few more tweaks - it fails on that proto schema (see here) in two ways:\n\nit doesn't expect hex numbers, giving \"unable to parse integers\" on everything in NativeAdTemplate.Fields\nit fails to resolve Hyperlocal.Point correctly\n\nI expect both of these to be easy fixes - will have a look this evening.. The annoying problem with enums in C# is that they don't have a defined order, and in proto2 the order matters (because the first one is the default). I think the rule for automatic \"yeah, this is passthru\" should be:\n\nif [Flags] or [ProtoContract(EnumPassthru=true)] - trivial case, explicitly pass-thru\n\notherwise:\n\nif there's an enum definition with value zero\nand if there is no enum definition that has a [ProtoEnum(...)] marker with a value that is different than the enum's native value\nand if there is not a [DefaultValue(...)] on the member that gives a value other than zero\n\nthen: treat it as pass-thru\nI think that works......?. The more I think about it, the more I think we should only worry about this if there is a [ProtoEnum] with a non-matching value... i.e. do we actually need to do any mapping. If we don't: just pass it through as-is; which means at the DSL layer, both proto2 and proto3 can include this happily. It is only user-generated \"code-first\" enums that would ever have this problem.. What you say about VideoFormat is fine if we use the \"The more I think about it\" version, i.e. \"as long as we don't know that there is a conflict: use the simple rules\". This would only ever apply to \"I'm using enums that I wrote in my regular non-.proto code, and I've added ProtoEnum to remap the values\". This is a tiny edge case, and I'm OK if things are more complicated for that scenario. The default thing isn't a factor there - was just being paranoid - separate concern.\nBTW, I fixed the parser - it almost works perfectly for that .proto now - only issue is the emitted code doesn't give quite the right name - it says public Point CenterPoint { get; set; } when it should be public Hyperlocal.Point CenterPoint { get; set; }. That's a known issue (it was already in the \"Pending work items in generated code\" list) that I'll try to fix tonight.. @rstonkus \"exactly!\" - the fact that is unclear highlights how unusual a situation that is. But basically, protobuf-net supports the hypothetical situation where you have an enum:\nenum Foo {\n    A = 0, B = 17, C = 42\n}\n\nAnd for whatever reason you want to use that in a model that is (perhaps at a later date) being exposed to protobuf but where the protobuf enum has values 0, 1, 4. In that scenario you can add [ProtoEnum(Value = 1)] against B and [ProtoEnum(Value = 4)] against C, and those values will be used in the serialization. This is a very unusual scenario, and is the only one where the pass-thru would appear to be unsafe. Having a [ProtoEnum] marker by itself is fine, as is using the same value in the ProtoEnum and the .NET enum.\n. This will behave in the desired way in 2.3.0; tests (passing) have been added, etc; https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/commit/b248af6487c9baf89d199868aa72695bf60ea4fa\nThe strict mode is enabled by explicitly setting EnumPassThru to false.

Yeah, this isn't a package reference on regular .NET; it is a framework reference. Try:\n<Reference Include=System.Xml\" />\n\nIt is, however, a package reference in .NET core. Build tools are fun :/ I have fun Condition markers to do things like this, for example in protobuf-net itself:\n<ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(ImportLibs)|$(FeatureServiceModel)' == 'net|true'\">\n    <Reference Include=\"System.ServiceModel\" />\n    <Reference Include=\"System.Configuration\" />\n    <Reference Include=\"System.Runtime.Serialization\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(ImportLibs)' == 'core'\">\n    <!-- could make this more granular to respect the options, but no need yet -->\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.Emit\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Reflection.TypeExtensions\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Xml.XmlSerializer\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\nHowever, I'm slightly confused because IIRC System.Xml is actually included by default. Sheesh.\nThe fact is the build tools are a bit of a mess right now (for .NET / .NET core generally, not this library specifically). It is causing me pain on a number of projects. Fixes are in the pipelines, but are outside of my control.. If you're targetting .NET 3.5, then it is System.Xml 2.0; .NET 3.5 are incremental additions to .NET 2.0 via additional assemblies; the base assembles do not change (except for bugfixes etc, but they didn't increase the major version).\nBecause System.Xml.Linq is one of those additions in .NET 3.5, it gets the 3.5 versioning; however System.Xml: does not - it stays 2.0\nIn .NET 4.0, they all become 4.0.. AFAIK (and I'm happy to be corrected): System.Xml 3.5 does not exist.. at least, not in regular .NET. If it exists in some Mono / Unity / whatever branch, then fine.. Closing issue; 2.3.0 will include 2.0 and 3.5 builds via the \"VS\" configuration (that only works in VS, hence the name). What is \"it\" in this context? What specifically are you looking for? Are you talking about the DSL parsing tools (protogen)? And if so, are you talking about the old version, or are you talking about the version that I'm working on for the 2.3.0 release? If you aren't talking about the DSL parsing tools... what do you mean?\nPlease be specific so I can address your question.. I'm happy to investigate, but I really need it to be clearer what you are after.

I'm going to make this part of the 2.3.1 milestone; 2.3.0 is pretty much wrapped - I'm just doing regression / test suite updates (see PR #265); have updated the branch release notes (will hit master when I've finished the regression test): https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/parser/docs/releasenotes.md. note: what I'll probably do is : when I've finished everything I want for 2.3.0, I'll take a look at this - if it falls out easily, it'll move into 2.3.0 - otherwise I'll ship 2.3.0 and look at it as a separate piece of work\n\nnote to self: also implement protogen --include_source_info. Yes, it probably should; will target for 2.3.0. It surprises me that you've hit this, as this should only impact the runtime-only (reflection etc) implementation. Are you running on UWP or similar, by any chance? Anyway, fixed for 2.3.0. K; I can switch to .FullName which solves a lot of this (it expands generics), but do you have a minimal repro that I can use to validate? My attempt at a repro shows the concrete type name, not the interface; would really like to validate. fixed in 2.3.0. d'oh! you're absolutely right; fix applied to code, will be in 2.3.0 (which is in package prep). fixed in 2.3.0. Do you have an illustration of what your callback signature looks like? And you mention silver light: I'll be honest : it is increasingly hard to support silverlight, and many of the tools I need to build and test for that aren't tools that I have installed usually. If the fix requires a build (rather than a fix of your signature): it is going to be gnarly.. I would say that is the correct deserialization - protobuf (the google\nspec) is designed such that data is appended, not replaced.\nThe good news is that there are two ways to fix this:\n1) don't run the initializer during deserialization - you do this by adding\nSkipConstructor = true to the [ProtoContract]\n2) tell protobuf-net to not interpret the list data as append; add\nOverwriteList = true to the [ProtoMember]\nEither of these should achieve what you want\nOn 25 Jun 2017 12:22 p.m., \"vmas\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSample (protobuf-net 2.2.1):\n[ProtoContract]\nclass A\n{\n    public A() { Values = new int[5]; }\n[ProtoMember(1)]\npublic int[] Values { get; set; }\n\n}\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n     A a, b;\n     a = new A();\n     a.Values[0] = 5;\n using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n {\n     Serializer.Serialize(ms, a);\n     ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n     b = Serializer.Deserialize<A>(ms);\n }\n Console.WriteLine(\"Sizes: {0}, {1}\", a.Values.Length, b.Values.Length);\n\n}\nAfter deserialization b.Values contains 10 elements instead 5.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/273, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AABDsPKT1O_uQ3AdYAJzKyFWjzUFrIDeks5sHkLbgaJpZM4OElLh\n.\n. K, this is a complex one.\n\nCurrently, the support for .net native and UWP / AOT etc is limited. As back-story, historically there is a precompilation tool for protobuf-net that allows limited cross-platform pre-compilation of the IL pieces. This kinda worked, but was awkward, ugly, really hard to support, and just generally messy. Additionally, this is going to be a nightmare as we add \"async\" (on the roadmap).\nI don't think that is the way to go in the future, although the google code download still has the bits for this.\nI have repeatedly been talking with MS and other folks re better ways of doing code-gen for this and other scenarios, for two different needs - the code-first approach and the contract-first approach. There are a range of plans to improve what is available here in the mid-range future. Basically the plan is to split the non-IL pieces (the reader/writer, etc) into \"protobuf-net.Core\" or similar. Projects would target the .Core project if they have generated C#, or both .Core and protobuf-net if they want to use the runtime emitter. The idea being that AOT scenarios would fall into the first camp.\nAt the moment, though, that mostly doesn't exist.\nIn the r668 world there is a core-only project that uses reflection. We could probably resurrect that short term, but the performance won't be anything to shout about.\nSo: are you looking for something today?

There are a few things that make this more awkward when starting from interfaces. Firstly, we can't just serialize it as a Class1 - it would need to be wrapped appropriately, which would mean any interface members at the root level, which would then probably end up being duplicated at the type level (because people would forget to exclude them), which is especially problematic for lists / arrays.\n\nSecondly, it is very hard to deal with interfaces as the root object, since when using GetType() you lose the declared type and only have the concrete type. This would potentially make it serialize differently per context, which is very awkward. Likewise when the class type is used directly without mention of the interface.\nThis scenario is a lot more nuanced then is obvious. It would need very clear consideration as to how it would behave in a range of scenarios including (but not limited to) these cases.. > Can you explain why that is the case for an interface but not the case for a class that extends a base class?\nIt is the case for a base-class / sub-class. The difference is that a subclass doesn't usually re-declare (new etc) the same properties that the base class had. Most interface implementations, however: do.\n\nIsn't this a good thing? You simply serialise it as a the concrete type which in my example is what I would like it to do.\n\nit cannot simply be serialized as the concrete type - that will not work in any way. During deserialization it needs to know what type to deserialize. Serializing it as the type itself includes zero such metadata, so you'd be thinking IFoo and seeing data for Bar, but with no clue that it is a Bar. This is why it needs wrapping in the first place.\n\nWell yes, because its an interface it would serialise as whatever the underlying object is. Wouldn't that be what most people expect?\n\nSee above.\nThe aim is fine, but it isn't as simple as just serializing as the concrete type. As I say: any approach here would need very clear ideas of what should happen (ideally in terms of the data protocol) in each case.. No. The problem is that the serialization of a Foo does not include anything that says \"I'm a Foo\".\nIf we did that, then during deserialization: how do you know what it should be?. A lot of the code does use exactly GetType() etc. That doesn't change he nature of the problem in any way. Types don't change their members, so it doesn't matter when we check if it will be the same shape either way.. Because this stuff is nuanced :)\nThere are 3 different scenarios here, and we'd need to know how each should behave:\n\nroot objects via generic usage such as Serialize<T> uses typeof(T) IIRC\nroot objects via non-generic usage may or may not have a type specified\nmembers inside types know the member's type\n\nFrankly, I don't think the problem that you're trying to solve is very clear at the moment. And the key point is: it isn't enough to serialize - we also need to be able to deserialize knowing just the interface.. Indeed, but we start getting into problems.\nConsider: in order to serialize such a model, we need to find the logical root, which in this case probably is the interface - so: imagine we have:\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(Foo))]\ninterface IFoo {\n   [ProtoMember(1)] int Id {get;set;}\n}\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(Bar))]\nclass Foo : IFoo {\n    public int Id {get;set;}\n    // ...\n}\n[ProtoContract]\nclass Bar : Foo { ... }\n\nSo far so good. If we see a Bar, we need to build the model. Currently we just look at the .BaseType, which is simple and readily available - we find Foo, notice that there is an \"include\" and note that Bar's logical root is Foo, and we start from there.\nSo; let's say we want to fully support interfaces. Now we need to look not just at the .BaseType of each level, but also at the interfaces implemented by each level - and check them for \"include\" directives. In theory that's fine - we can find IFoo easily enough and determine that IFoo is the logical root for Foo and Bar.\nNote that this is not the same as just serializing the concrete type - we need to start at the logical root in order to be able to deserialize correctly (we need to identify the correct type). This is one of the key points I was trying to call out earlier, although perhaps that is largely an implementation detail (it is a very important one). It would also be necessary to observe that adding an interface using this kind of \"include\" approach is fundamentally a breaking serialization change in the same way that adding a new base-type (with \"include\") is a breaking serialization change. But it can probably work - it just doesn't today.\nIt gets more complex, though - we'd need to think about what scenarios we don't support and how to message the user. For example:\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(SomeType))]\ninterface IFoo {...}\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(SomeType))]\ninterface IBar {...}\n\n[ProtoContract]\nclass SomeType : IFoo, IBar { ... }\n\nThis doesn't have a sensible common root, and cannot be supported. Then we get into interfaces implementing interfaces (IFoo : IBar), etc. Should that work? \nThis is probably fine, for example:\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(IBar))]\ninterface IFoo {...}\n[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(10, typeof(SomeType))]\ninterface IBar : IFoo {...}\n[ProtoContract]\nclass SomeType : IBar { ...}\n\nBut what if we get to the same concrete type via multiple paths?\n\nWe also get into fun scenarios around unknown data and different versions of the contract; this is mostly the same scenario that we already have today for abstract classes, so it isn't drastically a new problem - but it is one that needs consideration\n\nI guess the point I'm getting at here is that this is a complex problem. It isn't impossible to do it - but rather, it needs serious consideration and design and testing - plus of course whatever changes it needs to implement it, and document it, and update any now-wrong documents/questions on the topic, and fix any code regressions, and update any tests that now fail incorrectly because of the changes, and support these changes at every point in the future. We can't just shoe-horn it in with a 5 line hack. And before I take on significant pieces of work, I like to understand why we're doing it - i.e. what use case it supports that can't already be supported in other ways. Ultimately, time spent working on this is time not spent working on other code, so it is all a juggling act re how to spend resources (mostly: my time). It seems to me that everything here can already be achieved via a DTO layer. I'm not saying we can't do it, but I'd really want to explore what the compelling example is for doing it.. In the example you give, during deserialization, how would the code know to select SomeType? what members are serialized? are the members on IFoo serialized? or just those on SomeType? What happens if the list contains multiple different IFoo implementations? Why is SomeType tested for, specifically? What happens if there aren't any known IFoo implementations? What happens if I serialize a SomeType instance by itself? Does that look the same as an IFoo that was a SomeType? Does a List<SomeType> look identical to a List<IFoo>?\nThese are the questions that I'd need to get to the bottom of.. > When you start deserialising you know what you are deserialising due to the ProtoMember numbers in the data don't you? So from these you can infer the type that was serialised eg in this case SomeClass?\nHow? where did that number come from? If we take your specfic example: where would it get such a number from? The only possible place is a [ProtoInclude] on the interface,  which takes us back to the more complex scenario that I strongly suspect is the only way to do it.\n\nWhen you start the deserialization process and you receive the memberNumber do you not look up the class of this member number? I'm not sure how this problem is unique to interfaces.\n\nThe member number only tells us that we're talking about the ListOfIFoo member.. If you mean \"treat all IFoo as though they were SomeType, and fail if one isn't, and just use SomeType during deserialization\"... then frankly I think it should be a List<SomeType>.... > It would get the number from SomeClass, it would never look at anything about the interface implementation.\nThat just tells us to expect IFoo. We don't know about SomeType from that\n\nUpon deserialisation you check every single object Is An IFoo and cast it to IFoo\n\nI think the key thing you're missing here is context on how deserialization works and what data the protobuf stream contains. The ultimate problem is: the data in the raw stream doesn't tell us what type of object to create. A List<Blah> when deserialized doesn't create Blah instances \"because the data tells us to\". Rather, it creates Blah instances because it is deserializing a List<Blah>. As such, it interprets the data (which is otherwise unadorned) using the rules for Blah. So: you can't just deserialize and then cast to IFoo - we need to know what to actually do with the data that we see. This is what the \"logical root / include\" approach of protobuf-net does - it defines a set of conventions for interpreting an inheritance based model.. K; the way protobuf-net encodes that is essentially (to use .proto syntax):\nmessage DTO {\n    repeated BaseClass listOfBase  = 5;\n}\nmessage BaseClass {\n    optional ExtendsBase1 _eb1 = 1;\n    optional ExtendsBase2 _eb2 = 2;\n}\nmessage ExtendsBase1 {\n    optional string Test3 = 3;\n}\nmessage ExtendsBase2 {\n    optional string Test4 = 4;\n}\n\nwhere exactly zero or one of _eb1 / _eb2 are assigned a value (this could also use oneof in recent .proto versions). The sub-classes are mapped as inner objects, and the sub-class data always comes first. In JSON terms (although it isn't JSON - this is purely for example purposes), an object would look something like:\n{\n   \"_eb1\": {\n    \"Test3\": \"foo\"\n  }\n}\n\nDuring deserialization, we start with a null reference, and start resolving fields, and only create the instance when required (because of data fields, or at the end of any deserialization path). Since the first actual data we get is the \"Test3\", it is at that point that we create the instance, which we know by the context should be a ExtendsBase1. If neither _eb1 or eb2 had a value, then we'd create a BaseClass instance on the way out (or when some data in that context was encountered, but there aren't any other fields in this case).\n\nMy point in the comment yesterday is that we could apply this same logic to interfaces, within certain constraints - mainly around the topics of multiple inheritance (resolving to contract types) would be disallowed.\nSo essentially, it could be mapped with the interface as the root type:\nmessage IFoo {\n    optional SomeType _st = 1;\n    optional SomeOtherType _sot = 2;\n}\n\nwhich would map to:\n[ProtoContract]\n[ProtoInclude(1, typeof(SomeType))]\n[ProtoInclude(2, typeof(SomeOtherType))]\ninterface IFoo {...}\n\nThis would allow us to deserialize an IFoo into any of the known / expected concrete types. This obviously has the issue that if no expected type is found in the data, then it can't instantiate - but that's actually the same problem we get for abstract base classes today, so that's not a new restriction..

The interesting challenges re inheritance aren't when you know what the concrete type is. They are when you don't know - and only know about the base type. From what I can see, this code will only work in the \"we know what the exact actual type will be\" scenario. This is indeed a valid scenario, but is the small %, not the large %.\n\nIs this the intention? Have I misunderstood?. No, I mean when you don't know what the derived type is. For example, with :\nVehicle\nRoadVehicle : Vehicle\nCar : RoadVehicle\nBike : RoadVehicle\nTrain : Vehicle\n\nAnd all you know to expect is a Vehicle. Ultimately this is the problem that ProtoInclude solves via root-based serialization. What you have is leaf-based serialization, which only works for specific types - it would be fine if you know to expect a Car, for example.\nIs this an intentional limitation?. closing as duplicate of #289 (technically this one was first obviously, but status update is already in 289).

In the C#, I assume that is a System.DateTime, not your own DateTime message? In which case indeed: the way that protobuf-net will encode that System.DateTime is not the same as your DateTime message in the .proto\n\nGood news: fixable.\nOptions:\n\nif you need to keep the DateTime from your .proto, you can do that but you'll need to create a .NET type that looks like that - presumably simply by running your .proto through protogen (https://protogen.marcgravell.com is the easiest way to do this)\nalternatively, use google.protobuf.Timestamp, the \"well known\" mechanism to express date/time info - protobuf-net supports this, including protogen (you'll need to import \"google/timestamp.proto\") and code-first (use DataFormat.WellKnown on that property); note that this option replaces the DateTime you've defined in your .proto and will change the data - and the change needs to be shared between all callers\n\nOther options exist, but those are the simplest. Note: if you have existing protobuf-net data that was serialized with the class shown, and you want to deserialize that in another client - then: it gets harder. Until relatively recently there was no \"well known\" format for dates/times, so protobuf-net invented one. Unfortunately the representation it used is not the one that got chosen, and is awkward to use from other clients. There is a .proto for it, though - see bcl.proto / DateTime: https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/master/src/Tools/bcl.proto\nIf possible, when using cross-platform clients, I suggest moving to the new \"well known\" formats for dates/times, but: this is fundamentally incompatible with any existing data stored using the bcl.proto approach.. thats very odd; I will need to take a look, but that \"actual\" indeed looks\nvery unlikely\nOn 10 Aug 2017 8:13 a.m., \"mizuno-gsinet\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI have encountered the following problem:\nusing System.Collections.Generic;using ProtoBuf;using ProtoBuf.Meta;\nnamespace ProtobufNetTest\n{\n    [ProtoContract(IgnoreListHandling = true)]\n    public class Inner : List\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)]\n        public int Int { get; set; }\n    }\n[ProtoContract]\npublic class Outer\n{\n    [ProtoMember(1)]\n    public bool Bool { get; set; }\n\n    public Inner Inner { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var typeModel = TypeModel.Create();\n        typeModel.UseImplicitZeroDefaults = false;\n\n        typeModel.Add(typeof(Outer), true)\n            .AddField(2, \"Inner\");\n        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine(typeModel.GetSchema(typeof(Outer), ProtoSyntax.Proto3));\n    }\n}\n\n}\nExpected output:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\npackage EFTest;\nmessage Inner {\n   int32 Int = 1;\n}\nmessage Outer {\n   bool Bool = 1;\n   Inner Inner = 2;\n}\nActual output:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\npackage EFTest;\nmessage Outer {\n   bool Bool = 1;\n   repeated int32 Inner = 2 [packed = false];\n}\nOf course, this is not my actual usage, but I really miss this behavior.\nAm I missing some points?\nThank you.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/297, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AABDsPSg0TBjkN7Mw0IehmpvKie3VB4Bks5sWq21gaJpZM4OzCEd\n.\n.

The \"assorted\"\nis stuff that has not been updated to the current build tools, so may not\nbe in an immediately buildable state. In the case of precompile, this is\npartly because the tool we use to hack around some platform limitations\n(IKVM) has been abandoned by the author. But also, it has always been\nsomewhat brittle and hacky. The library that is available for earlier\nbuilds seems incompatible with .net core etc, and frankly that simply isn't\nthe right tool to pursue going forward.\nLong term, the plan is to replace this tool with better build-like tooling\nperhaps using Roslyn, perhaps not. I've been chasing MS on improved build\ntime generation, and while folks see the need nothing has changed. The\nexperimental \"generators\" Roslyn spike is stalled.\nSo; right now I don't have good options for pre-generation, at least: not\nfor recent builds. If you're using an older build, then the old precompile\nexe should work.\nOther than that, I would need to dust off a lot of pieces to plumb\neverything together.

So I never solved the problem using some sort of way above, but I did manage to solve it using my own little thing.

From your email it seemed like this was the change that most concerned you, is that correct? I'm fairly new to protobuf but on https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding it mentions that \"When the message is being decoded, the parser needs to be able to skip fields that it doesn't recognize.\". In the event where someone was using a library that wasn't the protobuf-net library (or if they were using a version of protobuf-net without this fix) wouldn't the parser just skip the DateTimeKind field and the behaviour would be as it currently is with the DateTimeKind not being serialized? \n. Sure that makes sense. Do you know how we'd go about implementing the opt-in option flag?\n. OK, I've had a go. I've committed the following.\n- add a new overload to BclHelpers.WriteDateTime that accepts a boolean\n  to indicate whether to include the kind\n- forward the old WriteDateTime to WriteDateTime(value,dest,false);\n- optional: mark the old overload as [Obsolete]\nThe last point involving modifying the EmitWrite method in CompilerContext to ignore Obsolete methods - I can do this when using System.Reflection but I haven't come across IKVM before.

The code for the TreeObject class does not make use of a method named Add neither does it have an indexer. As you probably already know the _children field does have an add method and indexer with it being a List. If you'd like I can attempt to create an example project to recreate the issue. If I can't produce an example project I can provide you with a private message containing code from an old commit that produces the problem. Keep me posted\n. @mgravell  Sorry, the example I provided was just an excerpt, I should of included more. I wrote a very small console application that recreates the issue. The code only uses the latest nuget version of protobuffers-net. I was wrong about the indexer, my original code DID have an indexer that I forgot about and the bug DOES NOT occur unless an indexer is present. I was able to do this in 40 lines of code so it should be an easy read.\nFYI The children field is irrelevant to the issue, it appears to have something to do with the combination of the enumeration type and indexer. The children field is specified for code completeness.\nI didn't test whether the problem occurs with an explicit enumeration implementation with a type generic as well as a generic-less enumeration implementation.

Excellent, I've managed to create a class to surrogate our real life implementation for serialization, it allowed for a better implementation anyways. Thanks for your support. I've used protobuffers-net in a few projects. We used the library to transfer storage of data from a database implementation to a pure document-based storage implementation.\nI'd like to help in some way, If you are interested... I run a startup that generates documentation for projects like this... our back end uses protobuffers-net.\nhttps://www.docify.net/\nI think we could set you up with a free premium account if you have the slightest interest.\n. @mgravell Yes I took a quick look at the protobuf-net source to acquaint myself. The code for the TreeObject class does not make use of a method named Add neither does it have an indexer. As you probably already know the _children field does have an add method and indexer with it being a List. If you'd like I can attempt to create an example project to recreate the issue. If I can't produce an example project I can provide you with a private message containing code from an old commit that produces the problem. Keep me posted\n. @mgravell  Sorry, the example I provided was just an excerpt, I should of included more. I wrote a very small console application that recreates the issue.

I am not talking by creating the model in code at runtime, but by the protobuf library doing this automatically for you.\nI'm not sure if you currently support serialising dynamic types. However I imagine you would do it the same way I am proposing, treat the interface as \"dynamic\" with its type unknown until runtime.. Then I don't understand the problem.\nGetType would return Class1 in my first example. So it wouldn't even realise it was an interface, hence it should serialise without issue. However it seems to currently return IClass not Class1, why is this?\nWhen deserialising and it gets Class1 but expects IClass, could it not just check that Class1 is an IClass and cast it?\n\nNo. The problem is that the serialization of a Foo does not include anything that says \"I'm a Foo\".\n\nvar type = Foo.GetType()\ntype should = Foo, not IFoo\n. I'll give an example of why I thought it was simple.\nIf I make a base class with nothing in it, then make all my interface implementations inherit from that base class, then set the type to the base class instead of the interface the existing protobuf code works and will serialise and deserialise my \"interface\".\nThe above is ugly though, I'd rather just serialise my interface directly.\n. Thank you for the explanation. It makes a lot more sense after you detail the problems.\nIf we simply said you cannot serialise objects where the logical root is an interface I believe that would remove a lot of problems.

I didn't know that you had to \"rewind\" the memory stream to 0 after serializeing the object to the memory stream. Works fine now :). I do have a question about the process of the Serialize / Deserialize process.\n\nIf you are feeding in a memory stream to your Serialize method, and need to \nrewind the position to 0 in order to get the Deserialize method to read it, why not \nautomatically do this on the Serialize call?

Kindly let me know your thoughts on this. . Thanks a lot for the help. \nI was able to test with the sample that you gave and was able to implement in a similar but moderately complex POC. I am good to proceed with the main change shortly. I have the POC application in github for anyone else to get started link. ",

    "chrishaly": "This method can partial solve my problem. In my project i can control the startup.\nHowever some of library projects will provide to others use.\nIn some document about Protobuf 3, have two solution for Inheritace: one is use oneof equals to ProtoInclude and the other is \"Composite\" define a property with type is base class.\nIf use ProtoInclude there a two little flaw\n1.  When add or remove a child class, you should modify base class.\n2. Consider about byte size of field number, use which number as the first ProtoInclude argument sometimes becomes a question.\nSince if use a small number when need to add filed to base class the property field number will greater than child class field number, and then add a child class, the child class field number will greater than some property field number, I think it's a little problem.\nBut if use a great enough number will west of memory and network bandwidth.\nConsidering these problem, I prefer to add a ProtoInheritAttribute, in .net one class only have one base class just set the base class field number to 1.\nHow do you think?. I've try to solved this case, and create a pull request\nhttps://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/pull/287\nplease review. @mgravell \nI've improved the code for ProtoInherit please help me to review https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/compare/master...chrishaly:master, if it's ok I will create a pull request.

This method can partial solve my problem.

When add or remove a child class, you should modify base class.\n2. Consider about byte size of field number, use which number as the first ProtoInclude argument sometimes becomes a question.\nSince if use a small number when need to add filed to base class the property field number will greater than child class field number, and then add a child class, the child class field number will greater than some property field number, I think it's a little problem.\nBut if use a great enough number will west of memory and network bandwidth.\nConsidering these problem, I prefer to add a ProtoInheritAttribute, in .net one class only have one base class just set the base class field number to 1.\nHow do you think?.

Emphasizing that the issue is as suspected, reversing the order that \"SomeProperty\" and \"Tags\" are added to the object schema (from the above gist) results in the issue disappearing. Is there any practical scenario where the user would prefer properties, which typically mutate fields, be initialized prior to fields?\nSeems the logical order would be static fields, private fields, public fields, and then similarly for properties.. Yeah, that's the thing I'm not clear on. Is this a part of the Protobuf specification or a part of the implementation? If it's a part of the standard (as in the annoying empty list -> null) then meh, but it seems to unnecessarily leak implementation details into usage that can result in inexplicable crashes. In cases where the schema is built programmatically (as opposed to manual annotations) it can create the extremely bizarre behavior such that the order of declaration of fields/properties can change the behavior of the serializer. That I think is extremely undesirable.\nSimilarly even just updating the dictionary as opposed to calling specifically .add would also resolve this issue, though I can understand the desire to use .add for more clearly deterministic behavior. Crashing is probably better than deserializing to a valid but unexpected state.. The behavior of the underlying serializer, and it crashing, is most certainly not a part of my own code. The current situation is such that changing the order of declaration of properties/fields in a class can crash the serializer in one case and result in perfect serialization in the other. This is a very nasty leak of implementation details.\nThis behavior is either caused by an issue in this particular implementation of protocol buffers, or it is caused by the specification itself. In the former case, this is something that should be fixed. In the latter case, this is something I should be expected to simply work around.\n. Imagine we have two objects in some sort of pseudo code:\ntype t1\n{\n    [SerializeOrder 1]\n    Property p {get {...} set {...} }\n\n    [SerializeOrder 2]\n    Dictionary d\n}\n\ntype t2\n{\n    [SerializeOrder 2]\n    Property p {get {...} set {...} }\n\n    [SerializeOrder 1]\n    Dictionary d\n}\n\nYou are telling me you believe it is reasonable behavior for the serializer to work perfectly for one type and crash for the other? If the standard clearly forces this behavior upon the implementation (as in the case of serializing empty lists and null identically) then that's unfortunate, but it is certainly something that, excepting outstanding circumstances, I don't believe you can say is nothing to fix.. I agree this seems like a workable solution even moreso since the functionality is optional. However, this does not currently seem to be the default behavior (in this scenario) as of 2.3.2..

In cases where the schema is built programmatically (as opposed to manual annotations) it can create the extremely bizarre behavior such that the order of declaration of fields/properties can change the behavior of the serializer. That I think is extremely undesirable.\nSimilarly even just updating the dictionary as opposed to calling specifically .add would also resolve this issue, though I can understand the desire to use .add for more clearly deterministic behavior. Crashing is probably better than deserializing to a valid but unexpected state.. The behavior of the underlying serializer, and it crashing, is most certainly not a part of my own code. The current situation is such that changing the order of declaration of properties/fields in a class can crash the serializer in one case and result in perfect serialization in the other. This is a very nasty leak of implementation details.\nThis behavior is either caused by an issue in this particular implementation of protocol buffers, or it is caused by the specification itself. In the former case, this is something that should be fixed. In the latter case, this is something I should be expected to simply work around.\n. Imagine we have two objects in some sort of pseudo code:\ntype t1\n{\n    [SerializeOrder 1]\n    Property p {get {...} set {...} }\n\n    [SerializeOrder 2]\n    Dictionary d\n}\n\ntype t2\n{\n    [SerializeOrder 2]\n    Property p {get {...} set {...} }\n\n    [SerializeOrder 1]\n    Dictionary d\n}\n\nYou are telling me you believe it is reasonable behavior for the serializer to work perfectly for one type and crash for the other? If the standard clearly forces this behavior upon the implementation (as in the case of serializing empty lists and null identically) then that's unfortunate, but it is certainly something that, excepting outstanding circumstances, I don't believe you can say is nothing to fix.. I agree this seems like a workable solution even moreso since the functionality is optional. However, this does not currently seem to be the default behavior (in this scenario) as of 2.3.2.. ",
