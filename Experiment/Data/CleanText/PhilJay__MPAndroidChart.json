    "PhilJay": "Now supported.\n. Now supported.\n. Thank you for your input. The reason therefore is, that the Chart draws the color white by default over the whole drawing surface. This will be fixed in the next update alongside other things like major improvements and new features.\nAs a quick fix, you could simply draw the desired color you want by modifying the library. You can do that by changing code line 304 in the Chart.java file (inside onDraw(...) method) of the current master branch:\nmDrawCanvas.drawColor(Color.WHITE); // specify the background color you like\nThen, the background should be drawn in the color you specified. Please let me know if this quick fix solved your issue.\n. Of course there is. Just call Chart.invalidate() at any time you want to refresh.\nI hope this helps.\nRegards,\nPHilipp\n. Good, I am glad you could figure it out.\nAt this moment there is nothing else except the readme and the example project because this library is still very new and I have just written it.\nNevertheless I am already working on something similar to what you mentioned.\nRegards,\nPhilipp\n. Should be fixed as of release v1.6.5\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for your input. \nAs a matter of fact, the most recent commit on the experimental branch already supports showing a custom popup View when selecting a value. The class that needs to be used for that is called MarkerView. Simply extend that class and you can provide any layout you want to be displayed when selecting values.\nConcerning the scrolling feature: This will very likely be part of future improvements made to the library, once all other known issues are fixed.\nRegards,\nPhilipp\n. Thank you for your input. You mean something like this?\n\nI am currently working on that feature. It should be out alongside other improvements within next week.\nRegards,\nPhilipp\n. I just pushed your desired feature onto the experimental branch. It should be working as you pleased.\nYou can use LineChart.enableDashedLine(float lineLength, float spaceLength, float phase) to enable dashed lines for the chart.\nBe aware that this branch is way ahead of features than the current master branch, but might not be as stable, depending on what features you are using. Data filtering (linear approximation) is not working at the moment.\n. You are absolutely right, that is kind of a drawback. I work on providing a solution for this issue as fast as possible.\nNevertheless, the charts displayed in your link are already possible (quite likely with some additional but manageable effort).\nAs a description for the x-axis, you can provide an array of Strings representing each day of the year, meaning 365 entries.\nThe index on which an actual value will be displayed on can then depend on the day.\nExample: Blood pressure 139 measured on January 10th.\n--> x-axis index 9\nBlood pressure 139 measured on February 2nd.\n--> x-axis index 32\nIt is not necessary that each possible index on the x-axis (ranged from 0 to 365) is bound to a value.\nI hope this helps a little bit, regards\nPhilipp\n. Within the next few weeks v3.0.0 of this library with major changes will be released which is finally going to close this issue, stay tuned :-)\n. Yes, & the latest release.\n. Work already in progress, thank you. ;-)\n. The legend feature is now available in a first version, enjoy.\nBy default, the legend is created automatically.\nFor further customization, you can call Chart.getLegend() and then customize it after setting data.\n. So your problem is that you can set the scale minimum so that the user cannot fully zoom out the x-axis, but the starting position is not correct / cannot be changed?\n. Very well. Thankfully, that does not look like that a major issue to me.\nI am going to look into that problem within the next hours and will hopefully be able to push a quick fix alongside with some other changes until tomorrow night (Europe), at the latest.\n. I have now implemented this feature in my local commit. The only problem for me is that I don't think it's good enough yet :-)\nI will try to change the implementation to a way that is satisfying for me within the next few hours to push on master or push the features current implementation to the experimental banch.\n. Allright, the implementation is now complete and pushed to master.\nYou can see an example in the ExampleProject inside the LineChartActivity.\nThe basic functionality is as follows.\nThe new method centerViewPort(int xIndex, float val) makes it possible to aim the center of the view to a specific position inside the chart, described by the index on the x-axis and the value on the y-axis. This also works very well in combination with the setScaleMinima(...) method.\nExample:\nA chart containing 50 entries ranging from 0-1000 with their values.\n``` java\nChart.setData(...);\n// restrain x-axis\nChart.setScaleMinima(3f, 1f);\n// center view to index 50 and value 500\nChart.centerViewPort(50, 500f);\n//.. now view is positioned on the right side of the chart on the x-axis and centered on the y-axis\n``\n. Allright. Please let me know if it works and if you are having any problems.\n. Thank you for your response.\nIndeed, there still was a minor issue in the implementation of thecenterViewPort(...)` method that caused the problem you described.\nI managed to track down the bug and fix it.\nIt should now work as expected.\nJust for the record, this is the correct implementation (you can also find it in the example project):\n``` java\n// first, set data\nmChart.setData(...);\n// restrain the maximum zoomout level, e.g.\nmChart.setScaleMinima(3f, 3f);\n// center the \"camera\" to your desired position\nmChart.centerViewPort(xIndex, value);\n// there should be no further need for calling invalidate()\n```\n. Can you describe your issue in more detail please? It would be great if you could provide a screenshot. I have not experienced it yet during orientation change.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thats very strange indeed. The current example project uses fragments as well where this problem does not occur. Could you post your layout file?\n. I just tested the chart in use with Fragments and programatically adding the chart to a layout.\nThis code works fine for me: (after orientation change, the chart is redrawn correctly)\n``` java\n    private BarChart mChart;\n@Override\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    View v = inflater.inflate(R.layout.frag_simple_bar, container, false);\n\n    // create a new chart object\n    mChart = new BarChart(getActivity());\n\n    // add some styling here ...\n\n    mChart.setData(...);\n\n    // programatically add the chart\n    LinearLayout parent = (LinearLayout) v.findViewById(R.id.parentLayout);\n    parent.addView(mChart);\n\n    return v;\n}\n\n```\nThe current example project also makes use of Fragments in some cases, maybe you can have a look at it and find your issue.\nI will now do some further testing and then report back here.\nAlso, I think that this might just be an issue with your emulator. Have you tried different emulator devices or a real device?\n. Thank you for mentioning this.\nUnfortunately I am unable to reproduce the error. On all my devices it is working just fine.\nCould you provide the code you are using to setup the chart?\n. Now I understand. This means that the chart is part of a ListView item?\nI will test this and see if I can now reproduce the issue.\nIf you could post the layout file of your ListView item, that could help as well.\nIn addition to that, I just added a new example case to the example project that shows how to use the charts inside a ListView.\n. UPDATE:\nI now know where the issue is coming from. \nIt comes from the android:configChanges=\"screenSize\" attribute that can be set for an Activity in the AndroidManifest.xml.\nIf you remove the screenSize from the configChanges, the chart will draw properly upon orientation change.\nThis attribute prevents the Activity from adjusting all Views to the new screen-size upon orientation change.\nMeaning: If this attribute is set for the Activity the chart is in, the chart will not be able to adjust to the new screen size that is created on orientation change, which will cause the above described issue.\nAlso check out the Android documentation about that topic: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#config\nI hope this will help you out, regards\nPhil\n. Im glad you could solve your problem. I am currently working on a solution that supports this attribute as well.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. So you are using the screenSize attribute? Could you again post your layout file?\n. Working on it.\n. Gradle support has been added.\n. Thank you for your input! I just tested it and you are right.\nFinding that bug is quite impressive!\nIt definitely requires some courtesy in order to be detected.\nI will address this issue as soon as possible and report back when it is fixed!\nRegads,\nPhil\n. In the latest commit I just pushed, this issue has been detected and fixed.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. As I am not an Android Studio user I'm unable to evaluate your exact problem.\nMaybe you could check out this post on stackoverflow and the related answers (especially the 2nd answer): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16588064/how-do-i-add-a-library-project-to-the-android-studio\nPlease let me know if this helped you out.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just merged the pull request from dodocat  that should fix the problem and add gradle support.\nPlease let me know if you are still having trouble, or if it is now working.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. @awareApps: Can you be a bit more specific what the exact problem is you are experiencing?\n. Thank you, I will merge this with my latest commits as soon as I get the time.\n. Thank you for your input.\nBecause of your post I just realized that method is only part of a previous implementation and actually no longer needed (dead code).\nI will completely remove this in the next commit.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Ok, so you need the following two things:\n- a stacked barchart / different values in one bar\n- a combination of line- and barchart (because of your \"limit\" line)\nI am currently working on implementing those features, but I cannot tell when exactly I will have the time to finish the implementation.\nIn the meantime, I suggest the following approach:\nYou can use multiple DataSets, each representing one color.\nExample\nYour limits are 10 and 20, and the colors representing the limits are red (below 10), yellow (below 20) and green (everything above 20).\nThe values you want to represent in the chart are 5, 25, and 15 on x-axis index 0, 1 and 2.\nNow, you create a DataSetthat is represented by the color green, and contains all values above 20. In this example case, that would be the values 0, 25, and 0 (everything below 25 is 0).\nAs a next step, you create a DataSet that represents the color yellow, and contains all values between 10 and 20. In this example, that would be the values 0, 20 and 15.\nLast but not least, you create the DataSet representing the color red. It will contain the values 5, 10 and 10. If you now combine these DataSets and add them to the chart, everything below 10 should be red, between 10 and 20 yellow, and above 20 green.\nFor your limit line in the chart, I suggest you modify the BarLineChartBase class of the library by adding the following code inside the onDraw(...) method: (between drawData() and drawHighlights())\n``` java\n    drawData();\n\n    // draws a horizontal line through the whole chart at value 10\n    float[] pts = new float[] { 0f, 10f, mDeltaX, 10f };\n    transformPointArray(pts);\n\n    mDrawCanvas.drawLine(pts[0], pts[1], pts[2], pts[3], yourDesiredPaintObject);\n\n    drawHighlights();\n    // ...\n\n``\n. Update: The [latest commit](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/commit/4a9504e0ba50c9f5b2f9ac4ffbaf177dfda8c6e0#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e) now featuresLimitLines` that can be set to the data object that is handed to the chart.\n``` java\nLineData ld = new LineData(...);\nLimitLine ll = new LimitLine(100f); // limit at 100\nll.set(...); // additional styling...\nld.addLimitLine(ll);\nmLineChart.setData(ld);\n```\n. Alright, it seems like aint took the time to mavenize this library.\nDoes #62 fullfill all your desires?\nAny additional wishes concerning maven?\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I have this task on my list and as soon as time allows I will add maven support.\n. Where should I create the account? Sonatype?\n. It's not dead, it's just that I currently have a lot on my mind right now ;-)\n. Finally, this is possible :-)\n- Add the following to your pom.xml:\n``` xml\n  \njitpack.io\nhttps://jitpack.io\n\n\ncom.github.PhilJay\nMPAndroidChart\nv2.0.0\n\n  ```\nBe aware that v2.0.0 is still beta.\n. Which fonts are you talking about?\nx-axis labels? y-axis labels? legend? values inside the chart?\n. Thank you for informing me, actually there is no possibility to directly set the font size :)\nI will implement this right now and this feature will be included in the next update.\nIn the meantime, you can use a workaround like this:\n``` java\nPaint p = mChart.getPaint(Chart.PAINT_VALUES);\np.setTextSize(...);\nmChart.setPaint(p, Chart.PAINT_VALUES);\n```\nEDIT: Unfortunately, the getPaint(...) feature is still buggy.\nAnother solution:\nCopy this code snippet into the Chart.java file of the library and use it:\n``` java\n/**\n * Sets the font size of the values that are drawn inside the chart.\n * \n * @param size\n */\npublic void setValueTextSize(float size) {\n    mValuePaint.setTextSize(Utils.convertDpToPixel(size));\n}\n\n```\nThen call mChart.setValueTextSize(...) whenever you need it.\nAlso, the latest commit on the experimental branch already supports everything you need.\n. Thank you for mentioning this, I will have a look at it as soon as possible.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Hello.\nYou can either clone this project via commandline using git clone https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart.git or download this project as a .zip file, here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/archive/master.zip\nAmongst the downloaded files, you will find a folder called MPChartLib. This is the actual library folder. You need to add this folder to your project to be able to use the full functionality of the library.\nIn eclipse, you can add a library to your project with the following steps:\n- Import the library folder into your workspace, using File-->Import-->Android-->Existing Android Code and then choose the library folder from your file system and press Finish.\n- After importing, add the library to your project by right clicking your project Properties-->Android. There, you press the \"Add..\" button and choose the library project you just imported into eclipse. Then press apply.\nThe library should now be added to your project.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Please let me know if this helped you out.\n. I am an Eclipse user. Unfortunately I am completely unfamiliar with Android Studio and have never used it.\nI am also not very familiar with gradle and maven.\nAll I can say is that I just created a new HelloWorld project in AndroidStudio and was able to successfuly import and use the library following this tutorial (2nd answer):\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/16639227/1590502\n. Yes, there was a limitation. I now removed this limitation and made a workaround. \nThe latest commit now supports Android 2.2 (API level 8). I hope this is sufficient for you :-)\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Can you provide some code and the layout file you are using?\nHave you tried cleaning the library and your project?\n. This means you are not getting any errors in code? (So all classes of the library are recognized correctly?)\nHave you added the activity to the manifest file?\n. Allrioght, so it was an issue with different versions of the support library?\n. It looks like your project did not build successfully. Make sure you have no errors qnd other issues (like different versions of the support library).\nDid you follow the steps above that describe how to import the library?\n. Thank you for your input.\nAre the labels also cut on a vertical axis? Or is this just your screenshot?\nCurrently the chart does not support wrapping the legend. But I am working on an update that allows wrapping right now.\nWhat you can do is call\njava\nLegend l = mChart.getLegend();\nl.setFormToTextSpace(..); // make space smaller\nl.setFormSize(...); // make form smaller\n...to save some space.\nYou can also edit the library and change the text size of the legend labels.\nA method for this is also coming in the next update.\nA little suggestion: If you have limited space and are using a legend anyway, you can call\nmChart.setDrawXValues(false);\nwhich will save some space inside the chart ant make it look better.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for pointing out the issue concerning the vertical clipping. I must have not noticed this during testing and will fix it in the next update.\nThe PieChart legend in general has some issues I need to fix, so you will probably have to wait for the next update.\nAlso check out the example project because the readme by far does not list up and explain all features and is outdated in some cases (due to the huge amount of changes I made during the past weeks).\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just fixed the issue concerning the vertical clipping. It will be published in the next update.\nIf you want to fix it right away, you need to replace the calculateOffsets() method of the PieChart with this method:\n``` java\n    @Override\n    protected void calculateOffsets() {\n    if (mLegend == null)\n        return;\n\n    // setup offsets for legend\n    if (mLegend.getPosition() == LegendPosition.RIGHT_OF_CHART) {\n\n        mLegend.setOffsetRight(mLegend.getMaximumEntryLength(mLegendLabelPaint));\n        mLegendLabelPaint.setTextAlign(Align.LEFT);\n\n    } else if (mLegend.getPosition() == LegendPosition.BELOW_CHART_LEFT\n            || mLegend.getPosition() == LegendPosition.BELOW_CHART_RIGHT) {\n\n        mLegend.setOffsetBottom(mLegendLabelPaint.getTextSize() * 3.5f);\n    }\n\n    if (mDrawLegend) {\n\n        mOffsetBottom = Math.max(mOffsetBottom, mLegend.getOffsetBottom());\n    }\n\n    mLegend.setOffsetTop(mOffsetTop);\n    mLegend.setOffsetLeft(mOffsetLeft);\n\n    prepareContentRect();\n\n    float scaleX = (float) ((getWidth() - mOffsetLeft - mOffsetRight) / mDeltaX);\n    float scaleY = (float) ((getHeight() - mOffsetBottom - mOffsetTop) / mDeltaY);\n\n    Matrix val = new Matrix();\n    val.postTranslate(0, -mYChartMin);\n    val.postScale(scaleX, -scaleY);\n\n    mMatrixValueToPx.set(val);\n\n    Matrix offset = new Matrix();\n    offset.postTranslate(mOffsetLeft, getHeight() - mOffsetBottom);\n\n    mMatrixOffset.set(offset);\n}\n\n```\n... and undo all changes you made to the legend drawing.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you.\nYes, that is possible. How the ColorTemplate works is described in the ReadMe.md file.\nFor example, if you have a ChartData object with 2 DataSets, and each DataSet should have 2 different colors, you need to do the following:\n``` java\nColorTemplate ct = new ColorTemplate();\nct.addDataSetColors(new String[] { R.color.red, R.color.blue }, Context);\nct.addDataSetColors(new String[] { R.color.green, R.color.yellow }, Context);\nmChart.setColorTemplate(ct);\n```\nAfter that, the first DataSet will have the colors \"red\" and \"blue\", and use them alternately. The second DataSet will have the colors \"green\" and \"yellow\" and also use them alternately.\nChanging the background color below the lines is currently not supported.\nBe aware that the ColorTemplate will be deprecated in the next update and colors can then be set via DataSet directly. This implementation should then be much clearer and easier to use.\nHere is the full explanation:\nSetting colors:\nSetting colors can be done via the ColorTemplate class that already comes with some predefined colors (constants of the template e.g. ColorTemplate.LIBERTY_COLORS). \nExplaination: The ColorTemplate basically has two methods for setting colors:\n- addDataSetColors(int[] colors, Context c): This method will add a new array of colors for the DataSet at the current index. The current index starts at 0 and counts up per call of this method. If no calls of this method have been done before, the colors set in this call will be used for the DataSet at index 0 in the ChartData object. Upon calling this method again on the same ColorTemplate object, the provided color values will be used for the DataSet at index 1.\n- addColorsForDataSets(int[] colors, Context c): This method will spread the provided color values over an equal amount of DataSet objects, using only one color per DataSet.\nIn our example case, we want one color for each DataSet (red and green), which will mean, that all entries belonging to the same DataSet will have the same color:\njava\n    ColorTemplate ct = new ColorTemplate();\n    ct.addColorsForDataSets(new int[] { R.color.red, R.color.green }, this);\n    chart.setColorTemplate(ct);\nIt would also be possible to let each DataSet have variations of a specific color. For example company 1 should have 4 colors from light to dark red, and company 2 should have 4 colors from light to dark green. In that case, we specify a color array for each DataSet:\njava\n    ColorTemplate ct = new ColorTemplate();\n    ct.addDataSetColors(redColors, this); // redColors is an array containing 4 colors\n    ct.addDataSetColors(greenColors, this);\n    chart.setColorTemplate(ct);\n. Allright now I understand.\nI am currently working on a new model that will allow you to set one (or more) colors for a line, and one (or more) colors for the circles, completely independant of each other.\nYou can already see this on the latest commits of the experimental branch.\nThen your requirements should be fulfilled.\n. I tested it myself, it works, thank you very much.\n. Well, there is no such method like Chart.addDataSet(...) yet. But I will work on that.\nIn the meantime, you could do a workaround like this:\n``` java\npublic void handleNewData(DataSet newData) {\nChartData cd = mChart.getDataOriginal();\nArrayList<DataSet> sets = cd.getDataSets();\n\n// add the new dataset\nsets.add(newData);\n\nChartData newCd = new ChartData(sets, cd.getXVals());\nmChart.setData(newCd);\n\n}\n```\nI know it's quite ugly, but it should be only a temporary solution. Please let me know if this worked for you.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for your feedback.\nI just released the new data model a few hours ago. Colors can now be set directly for each DataSet. The example project already makes use of the new model.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thanks for letting me know. I have merged your request! I've checked out your app, it looks great. Make sure you check out the new features of the library (various bugfixes, design improvements, animations, ...).\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Sorry, this is an Android library only, usage for iPhone / iOS development is not supported.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Now, an iOS version of this library is available: ios-charts\n. Hello!\nI am glad to hear that developers are considering this library for their applications.\nOriginally, I did not plan to create a candlestick chart. Nevertheless, I have already received quite a few e-mails from people requesting a candlestick chart implementation. So I have decided to add a candlestick chart to the library.\nWhat is your timeframe? Since I am quite busy with other stuff this week, I can start implementing the candlestick chart at the beginning of next week, at the earliest. Whad I already did is create the basis for later implementing the candlestickchart on the experimental branch.\nI doubt that any code from the mentioned open-source projects can be directly used for this library, but it can't do any harm taking a look at them.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Alright. Without any promises, I think I will be able to publish a first version of the candlestick-chart within the next two weeks.\nUntil that, stay tuned. :)\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just finished a first version of the CandleStickChart and pushed it to master.\nCheck out the implementation of the example project in order to find out how to use it.\nFurthermore, within a few hours the updated exapmle application should be uploaded to the playstore that shows the candlestickchart in use.\nI am not very familiar with candle-stick charts so it would be nice if you could give me feedback of what is not working / what should be changed / what should be added.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Allright. I also added a screenshot to the readme so you can check out what the chart looks like right now.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Slowness / reaction time of the highlighting touch-gesture should now be fixed. \nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for letting me know, it should be fixed now. Please let me know if it works. I removed the application tag.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for letting me know, I just fixed this issue.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I have no idea why that would be <= 1 to be honest :)\nI just fixed it now the PieChart supports to show only 1 value as well.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Alright, try it like this:\njava\nLineDataSet d = new LineDataSet(values, \"DataSet \");\nd.setColor(Color.RED);\nIf then, your data set is in color red, the library is working, and you are making a mistake resolving the color from the resources. As you already mentioned, the example project is working, which makes it highly likely that the issue is on your end.\nYou should use:\n``` java\nint color = getResources().getIdentifier(\"color_\" + finalLabels.get(i).toLowerCase(), \"color\", getPackageName()); // get the color resource id\n// resolve the resource id\nd.setColor(getResources().getColor(color));\n```\nbecause getResources().getIdentifier(...) only provides the resource ID, and will not resolve the color correctly like getResources().getColor(...) does. This piece of quite complicated code has nothing to do with the library, it's more of an Android issue/complication.\nConcerning the highlight arrow:\nThis feature is currently disabled, but you can easily enable it again by putting this code snipped into the BarChart class inside the drawHighlights() method. Around line 200.\n``` java\n                if (mDrawHighlightArrow) {\n                 // distance between highlight arrow and bar\n                 float offsetY = mDeltaY * 0.04f;\n                 float y = e.getSum();\n                 mHighlightPaint.setAlpha(200);\n\n                 Path arrow = new Path();\n                 arrow.moveTo(index + 0.5f, y + offsetY * 0.3f);\n                 arrow.lineTo(index + 0.2f, y + offsetY);\n                 arrow.lineTo(index + 0.8f, y + offsetY);\n\n                 transformPath(arrow);\n                 mDrawCanvas.drawPath(arrow, mHighlightPaint);\n            }\n\n```\n. You men different String arrays for the x-axis entries on top and below of the chart?\nThat is currently not supported, but might be in an upcoming update.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You mean like an indicator that \"groups\" all values of different DataSets at the same x-index?\nThat is currently not supported, but also in progress.\n. Yes, I know.\nBut you can acutally quite easy fix that yourself. You need to do the following:\n- Open the library\n- Open the BarLineChartBase.java file inside the com.github.mikephil.charting.charts package\n- delete or out-comment this line \n  Log.i(LOG_TAG, \"DrawTime: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - starttime) + \" ms\");\n  (it's around line 270)\n. Update:\nAs of the latest commit, grouped DataSets for the BarChart are now supported.\n\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Unfortunately not supported at the moment.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. What you can do is either call setOffsets(...) and set the offset manually, or replace the replace the drawXLabels(float yPos) method of the BarLineChartBase.java file with this method:\n``` java\nprivate void drawXLabels(float yPos) {\n    // pre allocate to save performance (dont allocate in loop)\n    float[] position = new float[] {\n            0f, 0f\n    };\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < mCurrentData.getXValCount(); i += mXLabels.mXAxisLabelModulus) {\n\n        position[0] = i;\n\n        // center the text\n        if (mXLabels.isCenterXLabelsEnabled())\n            position[0] += 0.5f;\n\n        transformPointArray(position);\n\n        if (position[0] >= mOffsetLeft && position[0] <= getWidth() - mOffsetRight) {\n\n            String label = mCurrentData.getXVals().get(i);\n\n             // avoid clipping of the last\n                if (i == mCurrentData.getXValCount()- 1) {\n                    float width = Utils.calcTextWidth(mXLabelPaint, label);\n\n                    if (width > getOffsetRight() * 2 && position[0] + width > getWidth())\n                        position[0] -= width / 2;\n\n                    // avoid clipping of the first\n                } else if (i == 0) {\n\n                    float width = Utils.calcTextWidth(mXLabelPaint, label);\n                    position[0] += width / 2;\n                }\n\n            mDrawCanvas.drawText(label, position[0],\n                    yPos,\n                    mXLabelPaint);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nIn an upcoming update I will provide a fix for this.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thanks for letting me know. I just tested it and it really doesn't work.\nIt is fixed it in the latest commit on the experimental branch. It will be included in the next release.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for letting me know, I now removed the Paint object since it is no longer used.\nThe amount of transparency and the color used for \"filling\" the surface below the DataSet line can now be handled via:\n- LineDataSet.setFillAlpha(int alpha)\n- LineDataSet.setFillColor(int color)\nIn the latest commit on the experimental branch. It will be included in master soon.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. No, either every value, or none.\nYou would have to implement that feature yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Yes, you can either permanently restrain the scale-limits by calling:\nsetScaleMinima(float xscale, float yscale), example mChart.setScaleMinima(3f, 1f);\nor use the zoom method to temporarily set the scale:\nzoom(float scaleX, float scaleY, float x, float y)\nExample:\nmChart.zoom(3f, 1f, 0f, 0f);\n. Yes, there is a way, it's actually documented in the readme.md file.\njava\nXLabels xl = mChart.getXLabels();\nxl.setPosition(XLabelPosition.BOTTOM);\nFor the x-labels you simply add years. A specific handling for date-time is currently not supported.\n. Good idea. I will do that next week!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. The latest release: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases/tag/v1.6.1 provides a .jar file that only needs to be copied into the \"libs\" folder of your Android application.\n. I'm glad you could make it work. \nConcerning \"cubic\": You are facing problems because you enabled a feature that is not complete yet.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for mentioning this.\nThis is a known issue for which I was unable to find a solution yet.\nUpon each redraw of the chart (calling invalidate()) the chart clears it's surface with the color that is set as the background color via setBackgroundColor(...).\nAlso see here and let me know if you could find a solution, I have been trying to solve the background-color issue for weeks:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24724386/how-to-clear-drawings-on-view-but-preserve-background-color\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Should be fixed as of release v1.6.5\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Scrolling is not supported. But if your chart is zoomed in you can drag the chart surface with your finger.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thats quite weird indeed. I will take a look at it when I return from my trip on Sunday.\nIn the meantime you can try to fix it yourself or find a workaround.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you. I will merge this as soon as I get home!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for your pull request and for reminding me to fix this. I found a better way of fixing the issue.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. This is a known issue and has already been resolved on the latest experimental branch commit. \nThe mege into master will follow next week.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. This error occurs because you are using different versions of the android-app-v4 support library in your projects.\nYou need to use the same version of the support library of the all projects (libraries) that you are using in your project.\nYou can either do that by:\n- copying the same version of the support library in all your projects (like you did)\n- updating the support library via eclipse, for all your projects, do (-> properties -> android tools -> add support library\nRegards,\nPhil\n. That's actually quite simple. When looking at your code, I see that you are mistaking a ListView for a ViewPager. While the demo-app displays BarCharts in a ListView, you want to use a ViewPager.\nHere are the basics of what you need to do for using the chart in a ViewPager:\n- Create a Fragment that can display a BarChart, therefore you need a Fragment class, e.g. BarChartFragment:\n``` java\npublic class BarChartFragment extends Fragment {\nBarChart mChart;\nBarData mData;\n@Override\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,\n        Bundle savedInstanceState) {     \n        View v=inflater.inflate(R.layout.barchart_fragment,\n            container, false);\n    mChart = (BarChart) v.findViewById(R.id.chart1);\n    mChart.setData(mData);\n    return v;\n  }\n\n}\npublic void setData(BarData bd) {\n    mData = bd;\n}\n```\nAnd a .xml file that will be used as the layout for your fragment:\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n<com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.BarChart\n    android:id=\"@+id/chart1\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" />\n\n\n```\nInside your adaper, you can do it like this:\n``` java\n@Override\npublic Fragment getItem(int pos) {\n BarChartFragment f = null;\n\n switch(pos) {\n     case 0:\n         f = new BarChartFragment();\n         f.setData(yourData);\n         break;\n\n      case 1: // and so on\n }\n\n return f;\n\n}\n```\nThats about how it sould work.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. The left swipe of the ViewPager is \"disturbed\" because of the chart lying on top.\nIf you dont need the chart to be touchable, set:\nChart.setTouchEnabled(false);\nIn that way swiping the ViewPager should work.\nFor hiding the grid, call\nsetDrawHorizontalGrid(false);\nsetDrawVerticalGrid(false);\n. Thank you for mentioning this.\nI believe the reason for the \"slowness\" is the fact that the MarkerView is shown upon highlighting a value which is recognized via onSingleTapConfirmed(...) in the BarLineChatTouchListener class.\nThe reason could be that onSingleTapConfirmed(...) takes some time before the tap is actually confirmed.\nSince it takes almost equally as long when the chart has 4 or 500 values, I doubt it is a performance issue.\nIm currently working on another solution for this. If you have any suggestions, please let me know :)\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Issue fixed in latest commit.\nReaction time of the MarkerView significantly reduced.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Concerning the repeated call of onDraw(...):\nCould you tell me exactly where onDraw(..) is called upon selecting a value? It really seems unneccesary if its called that often.\nConcerning binary-search:\nVery good idea, I will implement it :)\n. So you would like the ability to highlight values, but not to rotate the chart?\n. Issue fixed in latest commit.\nUse PieChart.setRotationEnabled(boolean enabled) to enable/disable the rotation.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You are right, that is in fact the issue.\nIt should be size() - 1\nIm going to fix this asap.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. The crash comes from the setLineWidth(float width) method. The reason therefore is that this method internally uses the chartlibs Utils class to convert the line width you set into density pixels.\nIn order to use the Utils, they need to be initialized once with a Resources object.\nBy default, this is done in the constructor of each chart class.\nIf data for the chart is created before the charts constructor is called, the Utils are not initialized.\nIn that case, you need to call Utils.initialize(getResources()) just once somewhere before creating the data for your chart.\nI know that this is quite inconvenient and will work on a solution as soon as possible.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Hello!\nI am glad you like this library and that you are considering to use it. \nConcerning the RadarChart, I have some other things on my \"todo\"-list with higher priority, but I am definitely considering to add this feature to the library.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. A first version of the RadarChart is now available amonst the featured chart types in this library.\nYou are very welcome to try out and test it.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. What exactly do you mean by \"move the cursor\"? Do you mean highlight/select?\n. You can highlight entries by calling\nChart.highlightValues(Highlight[] highlights)\nEach Highlight object represents one entry that should be highlighted. You need to provide the x-index (index on the x-axis) that should be highlighted and the index of the dataset the highlighted entry is in.\nHighlight h = new Highlight(int xIndex, int dataSetIndex);\nExample:\njava\nHighlight h = new Highlight(50, 0); // highlight index 50, dataset 0\nmChart.highlightValues( new Highlight[] { h } );\n. Thank you for mentioning this. I must have forgotten to adjust that when I implemented thie group feature.\nI will fix this as soon as possible.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You are right, the current solution does not leave much space for customization.\nAs I am currently working on Radar- and CandleStickChart, there is currently no work in progress concerning the y-label formatting.\nIf you could think of a good solution that allows more customization besides or with the current logic, I would appreciate it if you could also make a pull request so that others can benefit from your implementations as well.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you, and very good idea!\nI will implement this feature as soon as I have completed my work on some other features I am working on right now. This is a great way of saving up some space.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just added the feature, please let me know if it works and what should be improved.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I am currently working on this feature and it will be released in the next update of the library.\nIn the meantime, you can quickly fix that by modifying the BarLineChartBase.java file.\nWhat you have to do:\nSearch for these lines of code in the file:\n``` java\nfloat maxTransX = -(float) mContentRect.width() * (mScaleX - 1f);\nfloat newTransX = Math.min(Math.max(curTransX, maxTransX ), 0f);\n\nfloat maxTransY = (float) mContentRect.height() * (mScaleY - 1f);\nfloat newTransY = Math.max(Math.min(curTransY, maxTransY), 0f);\n\n```\nAnd modify them to:\n``` java\nfloat overdrag = 150f\nfloat maxTransX = -(float) mContentRect.width() * (mScaleX - 1f);\nfloat newTransX = Math.min(Math.max(curTransX, maxTransX - overdrag), overdrag);\n\nfloat maxTransY = (float) mContentRect.height() * (mScaleY - 1f);\nfloat newTransY = Math.max(Math.min(curTransY, maxTransY + overdrag), -overdrag);\n\n```\nNow the chart should have the ability to be \"over-dragged\" by 150 pixels.\nPlease let me know if it works.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Update:\nThis feature is now included into the library. You can use these methods to set an \"over-drag\" offset:\n``` java\n /\n Set an offset in dp that allows the user to drag the chart over it's\n bounds on the x-axis.\n\n @param offset\n*/\npublic void setDragOffsetX(float offset);\n/\n Set an offset in dp that allows the user to drag the chart over it's\n bounds on the y-axis.\n\n @param offset\n*/\npublic void setDragOffsetY(float offset);\n```\n. Yes, I will add a feature like that to the library as soon as I return from traveling in about one week.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Since the latest pre-release, this is possible.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. This is unfortunately currently not supported.\nThe simple reason therefore is that the Canvas.drawText(...) method does not support the new line character and simply ignores it.\nSo the feature you need requires additional logic. I will include a feature like that as soon as I return from traveling next week.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Yes that is possible. You can do it by restraining the view on the horizontal (x) axis. Therefore you need to call\nsetScaleMinima(5f, 1f)\nThis will show only 20% of all values on the x-axis. Then you can set where your view should aim at by calling\ncenterViewPort(float val, int xindex)\nIf you call centerViewPort(500f, 50), your view will be aimed at the y-value 500 (vertical axis) and on the 50th value on the horizontal (x) axis.\nPlease let me know if this helped you.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You need to set data to the chart and then call\nsetScaleMinima(...)\ncenterViewPort(...)\nDid you do that?\nYou can also test the feature in the example project (where it works). You can find it around line 122 here in this file: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivity.java\n. Which chart are you talking about? Are you talking about the LineChart?\n. That's quite weird. It looks like you are doing everything correctly. I will have to look into that as soon as I return from my travels next week.\nIs it a big issue for you to keep the line android:text=\"Selected.\" until then?\nI believe the issue has something to do with the measuring of the size of the TextView. If it is empty prior to being drawn / rendered, it might not be able to adjust to the new value that is placed into the TextView when refreshContent(...) is called.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You probably will have to experiment with this until I get the time to fix it. It is most likely related to the same issue that causes no text to appear if no text is set for the TextView by default.\nWhat you could try to do is remeasure the MarkerView upon calling refreshContent(...).\nUnfortunately I currently do not have acces to a \"real\" computer, so I cannot fully address the issue.\n. I just made some improvements to the MarkerView. Please let me know if these improvements solved your issue.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Hello!\nUnfortunately, BigDecimal is currently not supported. What you can do is refactor the library and replace all used floats with BigDecimal but that will be a lot of work.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I will inclue a feature that allows custom formatting of YLabels as soon as I return from my travels next week.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. The code provided by romangromov (value formatter) is now included into the library by default.\nThe class is called LargeValueFormatter.\n``` java\n/*\n * Predefined value-formatter that formats large numbers in a pretty way.\n * Outputs: 856 = 856; 1000 = 1k; 5821 = 5.8k; 10500 = 10k; 101800 = 102k;\n * 2000000 = 2m; 7800000 = 7.8m; 92150000 = 92m; 123200000 = 123m; 9999999 =\n * 10m; 1000000000 = 1b; Special thanks to Roman Gromov\n * (https://github.com/romangromov) for this piece of code.\n * \n * @author Philipp Jahoda\n /\npublic class LargeValueFormatter implements ValueFormatter {\nprivate static String[] SUFFIX = new String[] {\n        \"\", \"k\", \"m\", \"b\", \"t\"\n};\n\nprivate static int MAX_LENGTH = 4;\n\nprivate DecimalFormat mFormat;\n\npublic LargeValueFormatter() {\n\n    mFormat = new DecimalFormat(\"###E0\");\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value) {\n    return makePretty(value);\n}\n\n/**\n * Formats each number properly.

Unfortunately, horizontal bars are currently not supported.\nNevertheless, I am considering to add this feature in a future update.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I am currently packed with work and cannot say when I will have the time to do this.\nIf you have the time, I suggest you try to implement it yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Horizontal BarChart is already completed in my local commits and will be available in the next release.\n. Thank you for mentioning this. I am aware of the issue and wil fix this as soon as I get the time.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Now working.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Have a look at the LineChartActivityColored.java file in the example project: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivityColored.java\nIt shows how to acheive a chart just like that.\nWhat you need to do is programatically call setBackgroundColor(int color) on the chart and set the color you want as the background.\nThe resulting UI the above mentioned Activity produces is the following\n\nPlease let me know if this helped you.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Exactly. You also need to call setDrawGridBackground(false)\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I am sorry i dont understand your question. Could you be more specific?\n. Yes. The BarDataSet has a method called setBarSpace(...) which can set the space left between bars.\n. As I already told you, you can refactor the library to use BigDecimal, this will take some time. Other than that, you can wait until I might add this feature, but I do not know yet when this will be.\n. Please have a look at other issues first before opening a new one:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/81\nYou can change the background-color programatically by calling setBackgroundColor(int color)\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Are you using the latest version of the library?\nThe issue concering the values being placed incorrectly above bars is actually known: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/67\nand has been fixed. \nYou can change the space between individual bars by calling BarDataSet.setBarSpace(...), you can change the space between groups of bars (like in your example image) by calling BarData.setGroupSpace(...).\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I am currently working on a more sophisticated way of dynamically adding new Entry and DataSet objects to existing data. It will be released in the next update of the library.\nIt will look something like this:\n``` java\nLineData ld = new LineData(...);\nld.addEntry(...);\n// or:\nLineDataSet set = new LineDataSet(...);\nset.addEntry(...);\n```\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Feature now included.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Please load the latest version of the library (v1.6.3) https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases\n and try again. I made some changes.\nAlso check out the DynamicalAddingActivity.java in the example project. It explains how to add data.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Could you be a bit more specific? I do not fully understand the issue.\n. Are you calling invalidate() to refresh the chart?\n. Not directly, but the chart provides a method called getPaint(int which) that allows you to retrieve any Paint object used for drawing.\nSo you can do it like this:\njava\nPaint p = mChart.getPaint(Chart.PAINT_INFO);\np.setTextSize(...);\np.setColor(...);\np.setTypeface(...);\n//... and so on\nI hope this helps.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Yes, there is. You can call fitScreen().\nRegards,\nPhil\n. The PieChart does not have a rule that does not allow more than 5 legend entries. How many entries can be displayed simply depends on the length of the Strings the legend uses.\nAt the moment the library does not support a \"wrapping\" mechanism for overflowing legend entries. If you want to implement it yourself, I suggest you get started inside the Chart.java file.\nAround line 730 there is a method called drawLegend() you can modify it to wrap legend entries there.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. The \"issue\" occurs because you are reusing colors. Provide a larger color array (different colors would make sense) to display all entries.\n. Does your issue only occur on Android 3.1? Does it occur on other Android versions as well?\n. Ok so the bug occurs on all Android versions lower than 4?\n. I am now able to reproduce the issue and am working on a solution. The behaviour is extremely strange and irritating.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Issue fixed.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just added this feature, it will be published in the next update.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Feature now included.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Dynamically adding and removing data is currently not supported, thats why it is not working.\nNevertheless, I am working on the feature in this very second, and it should be finished within the next days.\n. Have a look at the calculateOffsets() method inside BarLineChartBase.java.\nTHe space used by the labels on the x-axis also depends on the offset of the chart area.\nYou need to make sure the bottom offset of the chart gets bigger.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. That is weird. I just tested setting a PieChart to \"invisible\" via .xml and it worked perfectly well. I then used a Button to set the visibility to \"visible\" and it also worked and showed the chart.\nAre you sure you are doing everything correctly? Could you show some code?\n. Unfortunately I cannot even reproduce the issue (meaning it simply does not occur when I try it), so I have no idea of how to even find out what causes your problem.\nCan you post your layout file as well?\n. I don't exactly know what you mean. Could you be more specific?\n. Should be fixed in latest version. Please let me know if it works now :)\n. Not released yet, but working on it!\n. Feature now included in the latest commit.\nLet me know if it works for you.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. In the case shown above you could create 2 DataSet objects with 7 values each, and then set a color for each DataSet separately. Like this:\n``` java\nLineDataSet set1 = new LineDataSet(...);\nset1.setColor(Color.RED);\nLineDataSet set2 = new LineDataSet(...);\nset2.setColor(Color.GREEN);\n```\nIs that what you want?\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Wherever you create your data and add it to the chart.\n. Please have a look at the example project. There is no need to modify the library for setting colors.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/MultiLineChartActivity.java\n. Then you need to obtain the newest version. Older versions might be buggy and lack certain features. \n. Can you be more specific, I'm not really sure what you mean.\nHave you noticed the method setDrawFilled(boolean enabled) in the LineDataSet class?\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Looks very interesting, I'm thinking about adding this feature. In the meantime, you cand do a workaround like this (similar to what sy-tang mentioned):\nInside the library:\n``` java\nmRenderPaint.setShader(new LinearGradient(0, 0, 0, getHeight(), Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE, Shader.TileMode.MIRROR));\n// data preparation...\n// data drawing\nmDrawCanvas.drawPath(..., mRenderPaint);\nmRenderPaint.setShader(null);\n```\n. This will soon be fixed. For now, please cast to whatever data object it is.\nExample:\njava\nLineData data = (LineData) chart.getDataOriginal();\ndata.addDataSet(...);\n. Yes, it should if you call notifyDataSetChanged() and then invalidate().\nBut give it a try and let me know if it does.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. As of the latest update, this issue is fixed. You no longer need to cast to a specific data object, since getDataOriginal() will already return the correct type.\nExample:\n``` java\nLineChart lineChart = //... and so on\nLineData ld = lineChart.getDataOriginal();\nld.addDataSet(...);\n``\n. I am considering it. But at the moment it would interfear with the dragging of the chart when being zoomed in. I have not found a good solution for this issue yet.\n. Now availablechart.setHighlightPerDragEnabled(boolean enabled). This method was removed since it only provided a minimum of customization features.\nInstead, it is now possible to add a customFormat` for the values.\nThis is how:\n``` java\n// create decimalformat without decimals\nDecimalFormat f = new DecimalFormat(\"###,###,###\");\nmChart.setValueFormatter(f);\n```\nPlease let me know if it works.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. It's not really a bug, but it probably needs to be changed / adjusted.\nThe number of digits that is automatically calculated depends on the difference between minimum and maximum value in the chart, which is below 0.1 in this case resulting in 6 digits.\nYou can set your own amount of digits as well as a custom format in this way:\n``` java\n// create decimalformat with 1 decimal decimal\nDecimalFormat f = new DecimalFormat(\"###,###,###.0\");\nmChart.setValueFormatter(f);\n``\n. Do you mean some kind of \"refresh\" feature when swiping?\n. Please update to the latest version of the library and enable circles. Then you should see just one entry as well.\n. Maybe I was not clear. Please pull the latest commit, not the latest release.\n. The methodsetValueDigits(...)no longer exists. Furthermore, it does not effect theYLabels`.\nInstead, you need to use the YLabelFormatter interface with which you can do whatever you want.\n``` java\npublic void MyLabelFormatter implements YLabelFormatter {\n@Override\n public String getFormattedLabel(float value) {\n      return \"\" + ((int) value);\n }\n\n}\n```\nAnd then set it:\njava\nYLabels yl = mChart.getYLabels();\nyl.setFormatter(new MyLabelFormatter());\n. Thank you for mentioning this, I will have a look at it as soon as possible!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Already working on it, stay put.\n. There is now a method public PointF getPosition(Entry e) that will return the position (in pixels) the provided Entry object has in the chart. Concerning the bars of the BarChart, this will return the top left position of the bar. \nThe BarChart now also has a method called public RectF getBarBounds(BarEntry e) that will return the bounding box rectangle of the specified bar entry.\nLet me know if it works.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. What do you mean by \"resized\"?\nTake a look at the example application, it perfectly adjusts to the new screen dimensions upon orientation change.\n. Well in that case you actively prevent the chart from being resized. Why don't you remove the android:configChanges=\"orientation\" attribute?\n. That is not directly possible.\nHowever, you could create a custom MarkerView and then programatically highlight the value you want to show.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. So you want to highlight multiple values?\nIt crashes because some of your Highlight objects are null, because the for loop is not as long as the Highlight array.\n. Thank you for mentioning this, consider it fixed.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Are you using pinch zoom? Or zoom axes separately?\nIs the chart empty? Or does it contain data?\nHow much data does it contain?\nIt would help if you could post the code snippet where you set up your chart.\n. Are you using the latest version (latest commit) of the library?\nAre you able to reproduce the issue? Does it occur everytime?\n. Aaaaaah. I deleted some relevant lines of code during the code cleanup I did yesterday.\nUpdate to fix this should be out within the next few minutes :)\nPlease let me know if it works.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. If I understand you correctly: Yes, that is possible.\nRefer to my post from July 25th, issue #14.\nThe methods I am talking about are\n- setScaleMinima(float x, float y): Restrains the maximum visible view. For example setScaleMinima(10f, 1f) will allow a maximum of 10% of all values to be visible on the x-axis, and 100% of all values visible on the y-axis. (x-axis scale factor 10, y-axis scale factor 1)\n- centerViewPort(int xIndex, float value): Aims (centers) the view (what is visible in the chart) to a specific location.\nFor zooming, call\n- zoom(float xzoom, float yzoom, float xpos, float ypos)\nLet me know if this is what you are looking for.\n. I'm not sure I fully understand.\nHow about the zoom(float scaleX, float scaleY, float x, float y) method in combination with centerViewPort(...)?\n. If each position on the x-axis represents one day, the calculation for weeks, and months goes as follows:\n``` java\nint xvalcount = 365; // just as an example, could be any amount of days\n// for weeks\nfloat scaleX = xvalcount / 7f;\n// for months\nfloat scaleX = xvalcount / 30f; // assuming 30 days per month\n```\nThis just calculates the correct scale factor for the zoom(...) method. Now you can use the centerViewPort(...) method to aim (center) the view correctly.\n. If your x-axis is not linear (concerning date), there is no way to calculate the correct scale factor. In that case you will have to re-adjust (probably filter, ...) the data for the chart and only display whatever it is you want to see.\nThis then has nothing to do with scale factors or zooming.\n. How you filter the data entirely depends on your data model. You probably will have to compare dates or something like that and only add the data to the chart that matches your filter.\nNevertheless, this no longer has anything to do with the library.\n. You are welcome, and thank you very much for your appreciation :-)\n. Unfortunately values outside of the PieChart are currently not supported.\nNevertheless it's on my list of enhancement features.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thanks, I will have a look at it.\n. Should be fixed now, please try. :)\n. Screenshot?\n. Are you using the latest version of the library?\n. Could you provide your layout file and code?\n. Currently not supported. \nRegards,\nPhil\n. Currently not supported. \nRegards,\nPhil\n. That is weird. It must have something to do with the ViewPager behind it because otherwise the zooming works just fine.\nHave you had any problems other than with ViewPager?\n. Ok I got it.\nIf you are not using the .jar file, you can quickly fix this by adding the following line into the performZoom(...) method of the BarLineChartTouchListener.java\n``` java\nprivate void performZoom(MotionEvent event) {\nif(event.getPointerCount() >= 2) {\n\n    // and so on...\n}\n\n}\n```\nIf you are using the .jar file, you can either clone the repo and modify it or wait until I add a new .jar\n. Update: I uploaded a new .jar file for the latest release that should fix this and some other issues concerning the ViewPager.\nLet me know if it works.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I recommend you download the latest .jar file, if fixed some other things too I discovered ;-)\n. Be more specific please, I'm not sure what your problem is.\n. Are you drawing filled lines?\nAre you drawing cubic lines?\nDo you have \"circles\" enabled?\n. Have you tried calling\njava\nlineChart.setData(...);\nafter everything else?\n. Allright, this should be fixed now. Please load the newest version of the library and try it.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases\nRegards,\nPhil\n. For drawing a background only behind the bars, call:\njava\nBarChart.setDrawBarShadow(boolean enabled)\nTo adjust the color of the shadow-bar, call\njava\nBarDataSet.setBarShadowColor(int color)\nYou can find it in the example project (and application) as well.\n. There is no way to set an exact count of x-labels that are displayed, that depends on their width.\nHowever, you can set how much space should be between the labels (in characters):\njava\nXLabels xl = mChart.getXLabels();\nxl.setSpaceBetweenLabels(3); // 3 characters space\n. I have thought about adding this feature. But since it creates quite considerable effort (especially because of new offset calculations) I have decided not to add this feature.\nHowever, you can of course customize the library yourself in whatever way you want.\n(it also should not be that much work since you only want to meet your own requirements and do not have to keep the library working for all other use cases as well)\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Are you using the latest version? v1.6.3\n. Thank you for your pull request. I will implement this feature.\nNevertheless I want a different code design approach where the logic for enabling/disabling value-labels is inside the LineDataSet class, and not inside the LineChart.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Yes, it's called LimitLine. You can add it to your data object. It is also mentioned and explained in the README.md file as well as in the example project.\n``` java\nBarDara d = new BarData(...);\nLimitLine l = new LimitLine(100f);\nd.addLimitLine(l);\n```\nCanging color as you described it is not supported, you will have to implement that yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. This feature is now available in the latest release.\njava\nLimitLine l = new LimitLine(...);\nl.setDrawValue(true);\nl.setLabelPosition(LimitLabelPosition.LEFT);\nThe LimitLine label uses the same Typeface object that is also used for the normal values inside the chart.\n. Now supported!\n. Please checkout the latest commit (or latest .jar file). The issue should be fixed now.\n. To fix the crash, call:\nsetCenterText(\"\");\non your PieChart.\nI will provide a real fix as soon as possible.\n. New .jar file is uploaded, issue should be fixed now.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Do you have the nineoldandroids library added to your project?\nThis might also help you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18301764/android-studio-build-error-multiple-dex-files-define-landroid-support-v4\n. Then the issue might be that there are two copies of the same library (nineoldandroids).\nMaybe it would help if you could just clone this repo and use it as a library instead of a .jar file.\n. Seems like an issue in the calculateOffsets() method of the PieChart. I'm looking into it.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Please try out the latest .jar file, the problem should be fixed now.\n. You mean instrumental panel like it can be found in a car? :)\nMaybe this library / view is more closely what you are looking for: CircleDisplay\n. I'm currently working on a \"right-center\" solution. In the meantime, if you just want the legend to be right of the chart and centered, decrease the overall View height.\n. This issue should be fixed now, please try it out.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Unfortunately, that is not possible. However I will soon provide a custom formatter concerning the color, which will allow the user of the library to select a color depending on the current value.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Yes, that is because the default color (which is black) that is stored inside the YLabels object overrides the color you set.\nYou need to call:\njava\nYLabels yl = mChart.getYLabels();\nyl.setTextColor(...);\nThe getPaint(int which) method should only be used for changes to the Paint object that cannot be done via methods the library provides.\n. What exactly do you mean by \"it does not work\"? What do you see?\n. Your value is always below 50, that is why all circles are the same color:\n``` java\nif ( value <= 50 )\n        colors.add( this.getResources().getColor( R.color.infoview_air_good ) );\n```\nOr am I missing something?\n. At the moment, that is not supported.\n. You are right thats not possible at the moment.\nIt might have something to do with the various touch-events and gestures interacting with each other. I will look into it as soon as I get the time.\nIn the meantime, you will have to wait or try and fix it yourself.\n. Did you make any progress on this?\nIt seems harder than I originally thought O:\n. Thank you for noticing this. This really looks like a nasty leak. I will fix it in the next update!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just removed the static reference, let me know if anything else comes up.\n. Thank you, I will look into it.\n. This will be fixed in the next commit.\nAlso check the method BarChart.setDrawValueAboveBar(boolean enabled) method. It defines weather bar values are drawn inside or outside the bar.\n. This should be fixed in the latest release, please try it out.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for mentioning this, I am currently working on it.\n. This should be fixed now, please try it out.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. New LegendPosition.PIECHART_CENTER now available.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You could consider adding a larger x-values array if the value count is below 10.\nThen, it will look like this:\n\n. Please read the documentation and study the example project before creating new issues.\nYou can use\nsetStartAtZero(boolean enabled)\nor\nsetYRange(...)\nto control the y-range.\nFor controlling the x-axis range, refer issue #14.\n. setDragEnabled(boolean enabled)\nsetScaleEnabled(boolean enabled)\n. Try release v1.7.1.\n. Thanks for letting me know! This is a very good issue report and your solution looks promising. I have been trying to figure out the issue concerning the configChanges attribute for quite some time now.\nI will include the changes you suggested into the next library update!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. This should be fixed now, please try it out.\n. You will have to do that yourself, it is currently not supported. \nRegards,\nPhil\n. Please read the documentation and study the example project before creating new issues.\nYou can use\nsetStartAtZero(boolean enabled)\nor\nserYRange(...)\n. Working on a fix right now, should be out tonight.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Not at the moment. This might be a feature still to come.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. As a quick fix, you could use LegendPosition.RIGHT_OF_CHART_CENTER.\n. I have already thought about that, but I cannot use resource files because resource files would disallow me to distribute the library as .jar file only.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I am not planning to implement a 3D PieChart any time soon, so if you are willing to contribute this feature to the library I will gladly appreciate it.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You need to create your own Formatter class for the values by implementing the ValueFormatter interface provided by the library.\nThen you can return whatever value you want to be displayed.\njava\n   @Override\n    public String getFormattedValue(float value) {\n        return \"\" + ((int) value);\n    }\nIn code:\n``` java\nmChart.setValueFormatter(new YourFormatter());\n```\nAlso have a look here #77 and search known issues before creating new ones.\n. Please, read the documentation and check the example project.\nBarDataSet.setColor(...)\nBarDataSet.setColors(...)\nand so on...\n. That is currently not possible. However, there is a workaround.\nSimply make your x-values array larger in both directions, that will solve your problem.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30169327/markerview-goes-out-of-the-chart-for-the-last-point-on-the-chart\n. 1. Use the latest release\n2. Refer this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26202655/how-to-change-chart-background-with-mpandroidchart-library/26203947#26203947\n. Starting the animation from a specific position is currently not supported. You will have to implement that yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thanks for letting me know, the filtering feature is not completed yet.\nI must have forgotten to remove it somewhere in the example.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. This should be fixed in the next update!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for your pull request, but this bug has already been fixed.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Try the new LegendPosition RIGHT_OF_CHART_INSIDE. It is available since release v1.7.2.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. As of release v1.7.2, logging can be enabled / disabled with the setLogEnabled(boolean enabled) method of the Chart class.\nBy default, it is disabled.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. What happens if you call\nChart.setMaxScaleY(20f)\nand then try to zoom?\n. This should now be fixed, please check the latest release and tell me if it's working now.\n. This is now possible:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/README.md#usage\nGradle dependency\n-  Add the following to your build.gradle:\n``` gradle\n  repositories {\n      maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n  }\ndependencies {\n      compile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v2.0.0'\n  }\n  ```\n. This should be fixed now, thank you.\n. Are you using the latest version of the library? Release v1.7.2\n. I just added some improvements to the logic of where to draw the filled line.\nIf that should still not be sufficient enough, a FillFormatter interface is provided where you can implement your own logic of where to draw the filling-line.\n``` java\npublic class YourFillFormatter implements FillFormatter {\n    public float getFillLinePosition(...) {\n    return ...;\n}\n\n}\n```\njava\nLineChart chart = ...;\nchart.setFillFormatter(new YourFillFormatter());\n. I see your problem.\nIf you want to restyle the the labels in a PieChart, you can call\n- setValueTextSize(...) to modify the text size\n- and set a custom ValueFormatter via the setValueFormatter(...) method to make modifications to the text itself\nAnother option could be that you provide the description of the chart content outside of the chart itself, or in a legend.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I just added some improvements to the logic of where to draw the filled line.\nIf that should still not be sufficient enough (I am honestly not quite sure concerning cubic-lines), a FillFormatter interface is provided where you can implement your own logic of where to draw the filling-line.\n``` java\npublic class YourFillFormatter implements FillFormatter {\n    public float getFillLinePosition(...) {\n    return ...;\n}\n\n}\n```\njava\nLineChart chart = ...;\nchart.setFillFormatter(new YourFillFormatter());\nLet me know if this works for you.\n. Yes.\njava\nLineDataSet set = new LineDataSet(...);\nset.setLineWidth(...);\n. Use setStartAtZero(false) to draw negative values.\n. Call invalidate() on the chart and give future issues a proper title.\n. Thank you for your pull request. Unfortunately I am not able to merge it because it interferes with something else I recently created.\nIn order to achieve what you want, simply create your own class that implements the FillFormatter interface and return 0 from the getFillLinePosition(...) method.\n. You can also use the getPaint(...) method to acquire the HOLE_PAINT object and set a color.\n. Unfortunately that is not possible. You will have to create some kind of other View which you place besides the chart to show the values.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Use this:\nXLabels xl = chart.getXLabels();\nxl.setTypeface(...);\nSame goes for YLabels\nRegards,\nPhil\n. In consideration of potential other users of the library that might have the same question I will answer this in english.\nThe desired output of removing an Entry is that it disappears from the Chart. This should not (and does not) affect the range of values displayed in the chart. Meaning the spot where a removed Entry was displayed will simply be empty after removal.\nA feature, where the chart resizes it's bounds after removal (meaning the currently second Entry in the chart will become the first Entry after the first is removed) is currently not supported.\nDoes that answer your question?\n. I am not sure what you mean.\nThere is a feature in the XLabels that might be what you described.\nxLabels.setAdjustXLabels(false);\n. Yes. Issue #120\n. Yes, check the example project.\nsetDrawVerticalGrid(...)\nsetDrawHorizontalGrid(...)\n. Please check the example project, it's all there.\nSpace between individual bars:\nbarDataSet.setBarSpacePercent(...);\nSpace between DataSets:\nbarData.setGroupSpace(...);\nValues in percent.\n. Yes, call lineDataSet.setDrawCircles(false) to disable the circles.\n. setData(...)\nzoom(...)\nIssue #120\n. Could you be more specific? What exactly is not working?\n. Have you tried calling invalidate() on the chart after calling setScaleMinima(..:)?\n. Please try the latest release and tell me if it's working now.\n. Yes, check the example project on how to use the MarkerView. You need to create your own class and extend MarkerView. Then you can display whatever you want.\n. Thank you for this useful improvement. I am currently working on an update of the lib so I cant merge this right away.\nBut I will as soon as the update is completed!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Call chart.setYRange(0, 30, true);\n. Im not sure what you mean. The method is still there, you can see it in the latest commit.\npublic void setYRange(float minY, float maxY, boolean invalidate)\n. You imported the wrong Entry class. You imported an Entry class of the Dropbox API. You need to import the Entry class from the com.github.mikephil.charting.data package of this library.\n. Use the fully qualified class name.\n. The only thing you can do is set the slice space to 0 degrees (PieDataSet.setSliceSpace(0)). If you combine one very small number (value 2)  with a  very large number (like in your case a value of 13 Million!) it is quite obvious this will not look good in a PieChart.\nMaybe you should rethink your concept of visualizing data.\n. Can you post the code of your StatisticsActivity?\n. Thats weird. Did you try starting the Activity without the fullscreen flag?\n. I know the reason for the error, it occurs because the width and/or height of the chart is <= 0 upon initialization.\nCan you post the layout file you used for this activity?\n. Allright. I think your app crashes because you need some kind of container layout that wraps around the LineChart and TextView.\n. You are welcome.\n. That is currently not supported. You will have to create this feature yourself.\n. I was just about to say that :-)\n. Yes I know.\nSome kind of \"wrapping\" mechanism when there are too many categories / labels is not yet supported.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You will have to implement that feature yourself. By default, all labels are drawn horizontally.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I suppose your legend is too big?\nIn that case you will have to develop some kind of mechanism to wrap the legend if there are too many items.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Unfortunately not. Legend wrapping is not yet supported.\n. Combined charts are not yet supported.\n. Combined charts are not yet supported.\n. This is already supported.\n. You can influence the distance between points by adjusting the amount of x-labels you set.\nThere is no way to set a fixed size between points.\n. Displaying images in the center of the chart is not supported. You will have to do that yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thats weird. When exactly does the error occur? Immediately after you open the Activity/Fragment where the chart is in?\n. This should be fixed in the next update!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. I have uploaded a quick fix for this. It's available in the latest commit and release (v1.7.4). It's not perfect yet but the chart should draw now even with zero values.\nI will publish the full fix in the next release.\n. That's actually a very good idea. I will consider to add this in a future update. In my opinion it should be possible to implement such a feature with moderate effort.\n. Could you provide a screenshot?\n. Not possible at the moment. You will have to do it yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Now I see your problem. The setYRange(...) method is only available for charts with both x- and y-axis like LineChart, BarChart, ScatterChart, ...\nFor RadarChart and PieChart, the method does not exist and also never existed.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Not supported.\n. No it cannot. However, this library might be what you are looking for: \n. https://github.com/PhilJay/ValueBar\n. Animations are currently not supported for this kind of feature. You will have to try to solve this one yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. This feature is currently disabled due to recent changes to the architecture of the library.\n. Yes, there are even methods for that provided by the chart API. Call\n- saveToGallery(...)\n- saveToPath(...)\nor to get the Bitmap object itself, call\n- getDrawBitmap()\non the chart.\n. Could you provide the code you are using tho launch the Activity? And eventual .xml settings in the manifest file.\n. Allright thank you. And what is the code you use to launch the Activity?\nAnd what is \"fragmentView\"?\n. You cannot set specific steps, but what you can to is restrict the range of the y-axis. Call\nchart.setYRange(...);\n. I suggest that you either use additional TextViews outside the chart or modify the library to your purpose.\nIt's currently not supported by default.\n. You need to set this public void setDrawUnitsInChart(boolean enabled) to true.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thats currently not possible. However, it should be quite easy to fix. Just change the line in the PieChart.java file where it draws the values and units.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. You can use the method public void highlightValues(Highlight[] highs) to highlight values.\nExample\n``` java\nHighlight h = new Highlight(x-index, dataSetIndex); // dataset index for piechart is always 0\nchart.highlightValues(new Highlight[] { h });\n``\n. If you want to trigger the listener, callhighlightTouch(...). Currently not possible, check #78 \n. As of the latest commit, any **issues concerning the position** of theMarkerView` should be fixed.\nThe MarkerView now provides 2 abstract methods from which the desired offsets have to be returned: AbstractMarkerView class\nThe implementation looks like the following: Custom MarkerView implementation\nBy returning -(getWidth() / 2); from the getXOffset() method, the MarkerView will be centered horizontally.\nBy returning -getHeight() from the getYOffset() method, the MarkerView position will be above the selected value.\n. getDataCurrent() no longer exists. It's now called simply getData().\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Hallo!\nIn Berlin werde ich in n\u00e4chster Zeit nicht sein, aber das Interview geht nat\u00fcrlich trotzdem.\nAuf welche Art von Fragen darf ich mich einstellen? :-)\n. 6ter Januar abenst sollte passen. Habe mikro am Notebook und ggf. auch ein Headset.\nIst notiert :-)\n. There is no method for this. However, the z-index depends on the order you add your datasets to the data object.\n. Yes it is.\nBarDataSet.setBarSpacePercent(...);\nBut the space also depends on the number of items in the chart.\n. This will be fixed in the next release!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you, I will fix that in the next release. \nRegards,\nPhil\n. That seems like a piece of work :-)\nMaybe ill add it someday.\n. What exactly is the issue? :-D\n. Well the avoidFirstLastClipping(...) method is not responsible for that. It just makes sure no label on the x-axis exceeds the bounds of the chart.\nA method for always displaying the last label on the x-axis does not exist.\n. Thank you, this will be fixed in the next release.\n. Not yet supported.\n. Thanks for letting me know.\nI think I made the two changes you suggested. (deleted applicationId and replaced runProguard with minifyEnabled)\nCould you try if it works?\n. All changes applied. Please check.\n. Now possible.\n. Call setStartAtZero(false) on your BarChart.\nThis will make sure negative values are drawn as well!\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Have a look at the code examples in the ReadMe file or in the example folder:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivity1.java\nCode line 356 and onwards.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. I see, unfortunately, LimitLines on the x-axis are currently not supported.\n. Your math is absolutely correct. I was unable to directly merge this pull request because it interfeared with some of the changes I recently made to the library!\nHowever I included your code in my latest local commit and it will be online in the next release.\nThank you and regards,\nPhil\n. Fixed, thank you!\n. On the x-axis, you can now set that via calling:\nsetLabelsToSkip(int count)\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/XAxis-(XLabels)\n. Combined  charts are currently not supported.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for mentioning this, I will have a look at it.\n. This is now fixed and will be released in the next update.\n. Thats quite weird. I have never seen anyone having this kind of error.\nAre you absolutely sure you imported the library correctly?\n. This implementation is only correct if your chart always starts at index 0 and does not leave out any entries.\n. This is currently not possible but will be available in a future update.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Thats gonna be in the next update.\n. Thank you for this pull request.\nI will review the code and probably makes some changes and adjustments, and then release it in a new .jar file.\n. Nope, you did not miss anything.\nIt seems like this is an issue concerning the pull request I just merged. I changed the superclass of the Chart to ViewGroup. The issue should now be fixed.\nPlease clone again.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Yes it is.\nSimply create a new LineDataSet for each line and set your desired color for the line.\n. It seems like this is a library bug. I will see to fix it in the next update.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. As of the latest commit, any issues concerning the position of the MarkerView should be fixed.\nThe MarkerView now provides 2 abstract methods from which the desired offsets have to be returned: AbstractMarkerView class\nThe implementation looks like the following: Custom MarkerView implementation\nBy returning -(getWidth() / 2); from the getXOffset() method, the MarkerView will be centered horizontally.\nBy returning -getHeight() from the getYOffset() method, the MarkerView position will be above the selected value.\n. That is not directly possible.\nHowever, you can access the Paint object that is used for drawing the inner circles and do whatever you want with it:\njava\nPaint circlePaint = lineChart.getPaint(Chart.PAINT_CIRCLES_INNER);\ncirclePaint.setColor(...);\n. Call this\nChart.setDrawYLabels(false)\nfor disabling y-values.\n. Well the best solution would probably be to set a null value wherever there is no value.\nentries.add(null)\nHowever, that is not yet supported in the library and may lead to crashes and / or unexpected behaviour.\nI will look into it.\n. Yes.\nCall chart.setStartAtZero(false).\n. Thank you for mentioning this.\nNevertheless I recommend to use LargeValueFormatter only for values with 5 digits (without separators) or more.\nIt is not designed for small numbers like 162 in your case.\n. If the provided LargeValueFormatter is not suitable for your issue, you can create your own formatter class by implementing the ValueFormatter interface.\nAnd then set the formatter for the chart.\nchart.setValueFormatter(new YourFormatter());\nBtw: Values like \"200\" should work with LargeValueFormatter. \"200,5\" will be an issue.\nAlso check out the implementation of LargeValueFormatter.\n. You can now set it for each DataSet separately or for the whole ChartData object.\n. I have not been using Android Studio so far, just switched today. Havent seen the warning yet.\n. Wow, thats a lot of performance overhead for fill-alpha!\n. Then don't pass null, pass \"\":\nchart.setDescription(\"\")\n. That is not yet possible. You will have to implement it yourself.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Are you using a ViewPager? How are you handling the recreation / recycling of the Fragments?\n. And how many fragments do you have? How is your ViewPager configured?\n. You can callsetRotationEnabled(boolean enabled)andsetTouchEnabled(boolean enabled)` to enable/disable rotation and touch.\n. Getting single stack-values is currently not possible per touch.\nThis could be a feature for future updates.\n. Thats currently not possible! Feel free to fork!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. I have already thought about such a feature. However, the performance overhead for re-calculating over-sized bars is considerable.\nAs a workaround, for low numbers of bars, you could simply provide a greater amount of x-values. That will automatically make the bars smaller.\n. Check this out: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/RealtimeLineChartActivity.java\nThe feature you are describing should now be possible.\n. This is the example project: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xxmassdeveloper.mpchartexample&hl=de\nAnd this is the corresponding code: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/tree/master/MPChartExample\nIt can be found in this repository.\n. I responded on stackoverflow. Hope it helps.\n. Thx, fixed!\n. Yep, thats correct.\nIt's gonna be some work to refactor it all, but definitely worth it. \n. Yes that is possible, have a loot at this example: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/ListViewMultiChartActivity.java\n. Yep, thats correct.\nUse chart.setDrawHoleEnabled(true)\n. pieChart.setDrawSliceText(...)\n. Not supported on the latest release, but on my local commit it already works.\nGoing to be in the next update!\n. Not exactly sure. 2-3 weeks, probably even a little sooner than that. However, the dual y-axis festure is already working. Also in the example app.\n. Im not sure what the issue is here but I made some changes to the MarkerView for the next update. Maybe it will work then :-)\n. The latest commit: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/commit/74c4c166a5483fd18ec4bf25b9f103197a13dc9b allows this.\nThe feature can be seen in this demo-activity: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivityColored.java\n. In the code you posted, you are providing the same color (singleColor) for each part of the stacked-bar.\nYou need to provide different colors.\n. Thank you for willing to contribute! I very much appreciate a feature like that! Unfortunately this feature has already been completed by myself and is just not published yet.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. A feature like that would cause bars to overlap once all space is used up.\nIs that really a feature you want?\n. I just added a new feature that allows specifying the bar width with respect to the x-axis range. The new feature is currently on a separate branch and will be available as soon as v3.0.0 of this library is out.\n. Yep, good point.\n-> next update :-)\n. Yep, the HorizontalBarChart still has a lot of issues.\nI will work on fixing them in the next library-update.\n. Yep it does, but this PR interfears with about 35 local commits I made for (the great) version 2.0 of this library. \nIm not sure if I will release it in v2.0, but this library will soon have a full-functioning horizontal bar-chart.\nThis of course also includes fixes in the example project.\n. Thats currently not possible, you will have to find a way to implement it yourself.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Thats currently not possible, you will have to find a way to implement it yourself.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Thank you for your suggestion, but are you using an older version of the library? This should already be possible!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Pffff. I honestly do not have the slightest idea why this is (obviously) not working.\nDoes anyone else know something?\n. Totally annoying :-D\nNow fixed and will be published in next release!\n. Because the bug was fixed, but is not releasesd yet.\n. Not directly from the chart. However, it should not be that hard to adjust the layout of each ListView item and add an additional TextView for the title.\n. Not really.\nHowever, there are some methods to modify the x-axis labels.\nGo and check out the methods the XLabels class supports.\n. Unfortunately currently not possible.\nHave a look here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/28638938/1590502\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. It will be removed in the next update.\nRegards, \nPhil\n. Good point.\nI am currently working on some kind of color-formatter interface that will allow the user to return a customized color based on theEntry at that position.\n. Yep that is correct, negative values are not yet supported for stacked-barchart.\n. Now possible! https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases\n. You can check out the ValueFormatter interface.\nWith that you can basically return anything you want as a label for the values.\nAlso check out #162\n. Good point. I have now 35 local commits waiting to be used in the next library update.\nI will finish the update and also remove nineoldandroids lib asap.\n. Nineoldandroids is now removed from the library. Animations are now only possible for API level 11 and higher.\nThis will be online in the next release.\n. In the latest version, that is possible via\njava\n// limit the number of visible entries\nchart.setVisibleXRange(...);\nchart.invalidate();\n. You can call \nyAxis.setSpaceBottom(...);\n. Check out the y-axis documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki\n. Thank you for this fix! Unfortunately it interfears with some major changes that I just locally made.\nThis means I will not merge this PR and apply the changes manually!\nI hope you understand!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Horizontal stacked-barcharts are currently not supported by this library.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Merged this.\n. Now removed.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Locally I removed it already, it will be published soon.\n. Thank you.\nI have a short question:\nEverytime I create a new release of this library, will it automatically be available in the public repository for everyone to use as a dependency? Or does that require any extra work except from updating the \"Readme\" file with the latest version?\nIs it also possible to add the library to an existing project via pom.xml file? Would the following be correct:\nMaven\n- Add the following to your pom.xml:\n``` xml\n  \njitpack.io\nhttps://jitpack.io\n\n\ncom.github.PhilJay\nMPAndroidChart\nv2.0.0\n\n  ```\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Sorry to bother you again, do you have any idea why the v2.0.1 causes build errors?\nSee here: https://jitpack.io/#PhilJay/MPAndroidChart\n. Yep, I can do that.\nHowever, the PercentFormatter actually only puts the \"%\" sign behind the value.\nIf you call pieChart.setUsePercentValues(true) all values in the chart (no matter how high) will be transformed in a way that the chart sum makes up 100%.\n. Thanks for pointing that out, I will have a look at it!\n. Figured it out :-)\nIt's not a bug, however its probably not quite clear yet because the new code is not yet documented.\nIf you are using only the right axis, make sure you set the AxisDependency for your DataSet correctly. The AxisDependency specifies the axis (LEFT or RIGHT) the data should be plotted against, and by default, this is set to LEFT.\nSo if you only have a right axis, do this:\njava\nCandleDataSet set = new CandleDataSet(...);\nset.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.RIGHT); // this is set to LEFT by default\n... and it should work.\n. If you only want a CombinedChart, and the other charts do not matter to you, you can already use the current pre-release.\nA new release should be out within the next 14 days.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. The current example also shows bar-line chart combination: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xxmassdeveloper.mpchartexample\n. That is currently not possible, however, I might consider such a feature in the future.\n. For x-values:\nchart.getXAxis().setEnabled(false)\nFor y-values:\ndataSet.setDrawValues(false)\n. For PieChart, call setDrawSliceText(boolean enabled)\n. I have included such a method for you. It will be available in the next update. This method will not convert and simply use whatever value provided.\nsetCenterTextSizePixels(float sizePixels)\n. a) Yep, I already thought of that. However I think most people would then not understand that there is the possibility of having 2 y-axes.\nb) See a).\nc) I will do that as soon as I have completed the update.\nd) Thx!\ne) I dont understand.\nf) All formatting is now done via ValueFormatter\ng) See f).\nh) Setting minimum values above 0 should work. Below 0, you have to call setStartAtZero(false) \n. Now I know what you mean. by setEnabled(false) the whole axis will become invisible.\nWhat I did now is create a new method called setDrawLabels(boolean enabled) for the axes.\nIn that way, now there is the possibility to disable the axis labels only, while grid lines and so on are still drawn.\ncommit: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/commit/82f2d5595a9407be64535f7acca295d5a7654ad6\n. Yep, thank you I am aware of that!\n. This is currenlty not possible.\nYou will have to create the feature you described by yourself :-)\nBest regards,\nphil\n. Yes of course, an iOS (Swift) port of this library would be awesome. I have not yet had the time to start one, so if you are willing to get started on this it would be great :-)\nJust let me know the link to the repo (maybe post it here) and we can discuss the details.\nThank you!\n. @danielgindi just passed our 1-year anniversary :-)\n. Well the reason is I like ArrayList nothing else :-D\n. Allright, I'll do it as soon as there is the time. \u00b4Currently it's not very high on my priority list tough :-)\n. Since the latest commit, each stacked value of a bar-entry can be highlighted separately: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/commit/02e8149f5d40cdabc4692f1dbac93ed9d20309f7\nExample here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/StackedBarActivity.java\n. Yes. You can invert y-axes if you want to:\nchart.getAxisLeft().setInverted(true);\nThis will let high values appear on the bottom of the chart, low values on top.\nThe x-axis cannot be manipulated in order.\nBe aware that this feature is not included in the latest pre-release, only in the commits ahead.\n. Which version of the library are you using?\n. I am not sure what you mean. Can you be more specific?\n. Allright. Drawing a border line on the chart is not supported by default, you will have to implement that yourself.\nAs for the other things.\nSimply add two slices, one colored grey with value 25, one colored white with value 75.\n. That's currently not possible, you will have to implement it yourself if you want the feature.\nWhat you can do is call setDrawValueAboveBar(false), then the value will appear below the bar.\n. Duplicate issue #293 \n. Yes, it does that automatically. What do you want to display?\nHave a look here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26883298/how-to-format-values-inside-mpandroidchart\nThis is what a formatter could look like:\n``` java\npublic class MyValueFormatter implements ValueFormatter {\nprivate DecimalFormat mFormat;\n\npublic MyValueFormatter() {\n    mFormat = new DecimalFormat(\"###,###,###,##0.0\"); // one decimal\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value) {\n    return mFormat.format(value) + \" $\";\n}\n\n}\n``\n. No, simply create a valueformatter like shown above and set it to your\naxis or data object, that will do the job.\n. I'm not sure if I am missing something, but I think theaddDataSet(...)` method covers that:\n``` java\npublic void addDataSet(T d) {\n        if (mDataSets == null)\n            mDataSets = new ArrayList();\n        mDataSets.add(d);\n    mYValCount += d.getEntryCount();\n    mYValueSum += d.getYValueSum();\n\n    if (mYMax < d.getYMax())\n        mYMax = d.getYMax();\n    if (mYMin > d.getYMin())\n        mYMin = d.getYMin();\n\n    if (d.getAxisDependency() == AxisDependency.LEFT) {\n\n        if (mLeftAxisMax < d.getYMax())\n            mLeftAxisMax = d.getYMax();\n        if (mLeftAxisMin > d.getYMin())\n            mLeftAxisMin = d.getYMin();\n    } else {\n        if (mRightAxisMax < d.getYMax())\n            mRightAxisMax = d.getYMax();\n        if (mRightAxisMin > d.getYMin())\n            mRightAxisMin = d.getYMin();\n    }\n\n    handleEmptyAxis(getFirstLeft(), getFirstRight());\n}\n\n```\nOr am I missing something?\n. Yep, thats correct. \nA feature that allows the z-positioning of the limit-line is currently not available. You will have to modify the library (slightly) to achieve what you want.\n. Well if this is really an issue for you, I suggest you cut back to an older release of this library for now, and I will change the order of limit lines and bars in the next release!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. getLegend().setEnabled(...)\nTake a look at the example or the wiki.\n. Whats the bug?\nAre you talking about the values being close together?\n. That's not really a bug. There is just no feature that handles very small values in the piechart.\n. Can you be a little bit more specific about what you want? :-)\n. Well the first link you posted is absolutely not supported :-)\nThe second image you showed I think can be covered using the ScatterChart.\n. It`s all in the documentation wiki.\n. Thanks, I will look into it.\n. I have made some changes concerning your issue.\nIt should be possible now without that hack you developed.\nDo it this order:\n- set chart visibility to \"gone\" in .xml\n- change visibility to \"visible\" in code\n- change offsets to 0,0,0,0\n- set data to the chart\nLet me know if it works now.\n. The reason therefore is, that I do not want to permanently recognize a fling-gesture or single tap when the chart is zoomed in and panned / dragged.\nTherefore, gestures do not work in zoomed mode.\nIf you want to disable this, you will have to modify the library.\nLook out for these lines\njava\nif(mTouchMode == NONE) { // remove the if\n    mGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(event);\n}\nin the BarLineChartTouchListener.java file and simply remove the \"if\" condition.\n. Have you tried setting this before calling setData(...)?\njava\nchart.getAxisLeft().setStartAtZero(false);\nchart.setData(...);\nDoes it work then?\nThe reason is that upon adding the data to the chart, it calculates the axis. If your specific attributes are not set by then, they wont work until the next refresh.\n. Yep, sorry for that.\nchart.getAxisLeft().setPosition(YAxis.YAxisLabelPosition.INSIDE_CHART);\ncurrently doesnt work, its a known issue I will fix it in next release.\n. Yes they should. Can you show me your chart setup?\n. #406\n. mChart.getAxisLeft().setStartAtZero(false);\n. Please check the latest release notes or the example-project, this is already possible.\n. I dont understand.\nShow me the code for your Niveau 1.0 and Niveau 1.2\n. Are your values smaller than 0?\nIf yes, set startAtZero(...) for your y-axis to false.\n. Yes, there is a newer version 2.0.9, but I recommend you wait until I release 2.1.0 next week.\n. Check out the documentation concerning x-axis and y-axis: Documentation-Wiki\nEach axis is responsible for the grid lines in it's direction and allows to disable them separately.\n. Please show me your setup.\n. Dont do that thing with Collections and calculating the values yourself. Let the chart do that by simply setting the top and bottom space for the axis to 0%:\njava\nchart.getAxisLeft().setSpaceTop(0f);\nchart.getAxisLeft().setSpaceBottom(0f);\nThis will cause the axis to be calculated without offset.\n. Well, simply add 1 more x-value on both sides than you need:\n``` java\nxvals.add(\"\");\n// loop and add the \"real\" values\nxvals.add(\"\");\n```\n. You will have to add a formatter, all it does is trim the values down to percent values.\n. Currently, time-series are not supported.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. You are right, that is not yet possible. I will include such a feature in the next release, should be pretty easy to do :-)\n. Thanks for letting me know, I will check it out. Looks like a bug to me.\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Library version?\n. The new method is called moveViewTo(...)\n. Unfortunately that is not possible by default. You will  have to implement that feature yourself. It should not be too hard tough.\n. Thank you, that has already been fixed on my local commit!\n. Can you provide a screenshot?\n. What do you mean \"is invoked too many times\"?\nYou cannot get the currently highlighted values at this moment, there are only callbacks upon touching.\nI will implement a method for that. In the future, you will be able to get the highlighted values by calling\nchart.getHighlighted()\n. Take a look at this example: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/RealtimeLineChartActivity.java\nEspecially the \"out-commented\" stuff in the addEntry() method.\n. Yes, see the docs.\n. Provide some code.\n. The CombinedChartRenderer now has a method called createRenderers(CombinedChart chart, ChartAnimator animator, ViewPortHandler viewPortHandler) that allows the customized creation of renderers.\n. Gradients are not yet possible, you will have to implement that yourself.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Allright that looks like an issue. So after clear is called when the x-axis has previously been restrained, it does not fully zoom out?\n. In my local commit I have just created a method called clearValues(), which does not remove the x-values from the chart, but only the added DataSets (and entries). Would that also help you out?\n. The image \"expected\" shows values from 0-10. So you want them to be reset from 22-32 to 0-10?\nOr do you want to only display values 0-10, but without restraining (so only 10 x-values are in the graph)?\n. Yes. \nUse chart.getXAxis().setPosition(XAxisPosition.BOTTOM) to set the x-axis position. \nYou can use chart.setVisibleXRange(10) to show only 10 values maximum.\n. Call rightAxis.setEnabled(false)\n. Thanks for this PR, unfortunately I cannot merge it because it interfears with a lot of changes I recently made.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Thanks, just create a new one!\nSo now the lib takes list instead of arraylist as a parameter?\n. Are you using the latest version of the library? They are called in my code :-)\n. That's not possible by default. You will have to modify the library to achieve that.\nRegards,\nPhil\n. Currently that is not possible, you will have to implement that yourself!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Call chart.setScaleEnabled(...). You can also find this in the documentation.\n. Now fixed, thank you!\n. You can use the highlightValues(Highlight[] highs) method to programatically highlight as many points as you want.\nAs for the changing color: You will have to do that yourself.\n. Could you describe the situation in more detail?\nWhich setup (which data) causes the chart not to be filled correctly?\nCould you provide a screenshot of what it looks like?\n. Okay so the whole area is simply not filled. That is quite weird.\nHow many values are you plotting?\nIf the issue occurs, could you tell me if you can find the following warning message in your logcat: \"Path too large to be rendered into a texture\"\nThank you!\n. Alright. Does the issue occur instantly, or only when zooming in?\n. Could you try the latest commit and see if you are still having the issue?\n. Good to know, I thought I might have fixed it!\n. Have you tried the latest commit?\nThere is no release-version with this fix yet!\n. Are you all using cubic lines?\n. Okay good then I can narrow down the issue to normal (straight) lines, I will have a look at it.\n. call setAvoidFirstLastClipping(...) on the axis\n. Yes, its possible check the documentation!\n. Known issue, already fixed in latest commit :-)\nThx anyway!\nIf it really bugs you, v2.0.7 should not have this issue!\n. Not really sure, probably ina week or so!\n. Yep, grouped bar-datasets are not yet supported for combined charts. I'm working on a solution.\n. I am on this issue, it's on top of my list.\nHowever, it's quite complex and needs some design beforehand.\n. The new v3.0.0 of the library which will be released within the next few weeks will include this feature, so I will close this issue now.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Looks like a bug, I'll check it out.\n. I have done some work on it and it should now display correctly.\nThe only thing not working correctly yet is the dragging / panning. It's also inverted at the time.\n. This should be fixed since the latest commit!\n. I dont know, but it's the only thing that makes sense.\nIf you want to invert the x-axis values (Jan-Dec), simply add them in a different order.\n. Since the latest commit, this should work.\nAlso have a look at the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Thank you, I just merged this on the CL to resolve some issues with my local commits!\nNow List is supported instead of ArrayList.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. I really would like to add you to the contributors list of this library :-) Unfortunately I could only merge your latest PR on CL.\nPlease get my latest commit, and make a PR that changes this to false.\nIt's actually really bad that this is set to true by default.\nBest regards, \nPhil\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Disable all zooming:\nchart.setScaleEnabled(false)\nDisable highlight / selection:\nchart.setHighlightEnabled(false)\nDisable legend:\nchart.getLegend().setEnabled(false)\n. Simply add an \"\" to the beginning and end of your x-values array and increase the xindex by 1 for each entry.\n. There is not really much to fix here. What you are asking is not supported yet.\nYou are gonna have to implement some kind of workaround.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. I hope it's that simple. Unfortunately in the past it wasn't. But due to my recent changes in the architecture this might now work :-)\n. \u00ddep, worked :-)\nI did some other changes as well so now even more unnecessary code is gone.\n. Not yet possible! If you could provide a clean implementation of this I would very much appreciate it!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Should be fixed now!\n. I wish I could merge this :-(\nUnfortunately I myself changed about 200 lines on the LegendRenderer.java file and it would create a lot of conflicts. \n. Thanks man! Changes commited and pushed.\n. The problem with the x axis:\n- simply add x-labels like \"0\", \"0.2\", ... and so on, then place your entries at index 0, 1, ...\nThe y-axis minimum value problem:\n- call setStartAtZero(false) on the axis, then set the minimum\n. This can now be done via the YAxis object, have a look at the docs: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-%28YLabels%29\n. Both are already possible!\nCheck the demo app!\n. As of the latest commit I just pushed, you can use:\nchart.getRenderer().getPaintRender() to get the paint used for renderng.\n. Is this related to issue #409 ?\nIf so, it should be fixed now.\n. The FillFormatter might help here.\n. The FillFormatter might help here.\n. So you only want 2 lines in your graph?\nThen you do not have to use the CombinedChart. This chart is designed to combine different data types.\nIf you simply want 2 different lines, use the LineChart and add 2 LineDataSets.\nExample: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/MultiLineChartActivity.java\n. Well if you only use one value, its not really a stack. So simply use the normal BarEntry contstructor for entries containing only one value.\n. Actually, there is one grid that belongs to the left, and one grid that belongs to the right y-axis.\nSimply disable one to make it look beautiful.\n. THats currently not possible! You will have to implement it yourself!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. What do you mean by \"cutoff\"? Can you provide a screenshot?\nAre you still facing these issues with the latest commit I just made?\n. Are you using \nxml\nandroid:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize\"\nfor the Activity the PieChart is in?\n. Allright, that should be fixed in the latest commit already. If you do not want to check out that commit, the fix will be included in the next release.\n. Next thing on my list is bubble-chart.\nNot sure if I will be able to get to this!\n. For me, this works: (startatzero disabled)\n\n(startatzero enabled)\n\nConcerning the \"bottom rectangle\":\nThis cannot work, even if startAtZero(...) is set to false. The simple reason therefore is that all bars start at zero. The reason therefore is that I also want to be able to plot values < 0 and values > 0 in the same plot. If i then let bars start at infinity it would display bars incorrectly.\n. Yep, looks like an issue. I will correct it now.\n. Fixed.\n. Should be possible in some way, you will have to try I guess :-)\n. Could you post your xml file?\n. Try providing those things, does it still crash?\n. setDrawLimitLinesBehindData(boolean enabled): Allows to control the z-order between the LimitLines and the actual data. If this is set to true, the LimitLines are drawn behind the actual data, otherwise on top. Default: false\n. Are you using the latest version of the library? This works for me.\n. Finally found the bug, please try the latest commit :-)\n. Great job, thanks!\n. ``` java\npieData.setValueTextColor(Color.WHITE);\npieChart.setUsePercentValues(true);\n```\nThen set a PercentFormatter to show the % sign.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartLib/src/com/github/mikephil/charting/utils/PercentFormatter.java\n. What do you mean by \"color\"?\n. Well upon highlighting the value you could define a new set of colors for your DataSet and exchange the color of the highlighted index to your desire.\n. Circles enabled?\n. I think this a known issue not yet fixed in v2.0.8.\nBut it should already be fixed in the latest commit that is not yet in a release version.\nSo you could check out that commit or wait thill v2.0.9 is released, which will be soon.\n. No, the color just needs to be \"resolved\", meaning you cannot simply provide the resource id alone.\nAnything like\n- Color.rgb(...)\n- Color.BLACK\n- getResources().getColor(R.color.green)\nwill work.\nFor transforming hex e.g. to RGB, simply use this:\njava\npublic static Color hex2Rgb(String colorStr) {\n    return new Color(\n            Integer.valueOf( colorStr.substring( 1, 3 ), 16 ),\n            Integer.valueOf( colorStr.substring( 3, 5 ), 16 ),\n            Integer.valueOf( colorStr.substring( 5, 7 ), 16 ) );\n}\n. Is there anything I can do about the crash?\n. For setting the window size, check the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nIt is currently not possible to set a specific grid interval on the x-axis.\n. I must have somehow missed that that is not yet possible :-)\nAnyway I added a feature in the latest commit that allows to separately set the color of the line behind the candle-body.\nHave a look at the CandleDataSet documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/DataSet-classes-in-detail\n. In order to display all x-axis values you can do the following:\n- reduce the text size of your x-axis labels\n- reduce the length of your x-axis labels (e.g. 19/03/15 instead of 19/03/2015)\n- call xAxis.setSpaceBetweenLabels(0)\n. Thanks for the PR, I merged it and made some minor changes.\nI think the ColorsList class is a great idea altough I would not call it that way. It's probably one of the next things this lib needs.\n. Nope, just set your elevation, you don't have to do anything else.\n. Add some margin\n. This is now possible. dataSet.setValueColors(...)\nExample here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/BarChartPositiveNegative.java\n. This should be fixed since the latest commit.\n. Nope, it's in the latest commit that is not contained in any release yet.\nIt will be in v2.1.0\n. Yep, I'm aware of that! Thank you!\n. Thanks for taking the time! Looks awesome!\n. So far no approach in that direction :-)\nBut you are welcome to PR :-)\n. Also, check those attributes for the activity in the android manifest: android:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize\"\n. Please try and see if it is fixed.\n. Allright, what does \"not properly\" mean? Please post a screenshot or something :-)\n. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce the issue. Form me all draws perfectly. \nPlease post your chart setup and your Android version. Are you sure you are using v2.0.9 of the library?\n. @romangromov do you also use cubic lines?\n. Yes, I will look into the issue. If it's a problem for now, simply disable cubic and it should draw fine!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Please try the latest commit and see if it works now!\n. Looking into it.\n. Can you provide your setup? How many values are you exactly plotting when the error occurs?\n. So you have 2 datasets in the chart? One containing data and one is empty but still added to the chart?\n. Allright, I think I found something. Please give it a try.\n. This is actually expected behaviour.\nCheck out the FillFormatter interface.\nThis interface allows you to define where the filling line should end.\nJust create your own  FillFormatter class that implements that interface ant set it to the LineChart.\njava\nlineChart.setFillFormatter(new MyFillFormatter());\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartLib/src/com/github/mikephil/charting/utils/FillFormatter.java\n. Have you tried redrawing it? Does it resolve the issue?\n. Please try again with the latest commit and see if it works now.\n. Yes, there are issues. I have just discovered some myself and I am working on resolving them.\nIf it's a big problem just revert back to 2.0.8 until 2.1.0 is out.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. I did some fixes regarding that, should be fine now.\n. Those methods already exist, check the misc documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Miscellaneous\nThey are called getLowestVisibleXIndex() and getHighestVisibleXIndex().\nAnd range = highest - lowest.\n. Are you talking about the y-values (the percent values)?\nIf so, yes you can, simply create a custom ValueFormatter, example:\n``` java\npublic class MyValueFormatter implements ValueFormatter {\nprivate DecimalFormat mFormat;\n\npublic MyValueFormatter() {\n    mFormat = new DecimalFormat(\"###,###,###,##0.0\");\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value) {\n\n    if(value < 5) return \"\";\n    else return mFormat.format(value) + \" %\";\n}\n\n}\n```\nDont't forget to call pieChart.setUsePercentValues(true)\n. Please give it another try, I fixed something.\n. Have a look at the documentation.\nThere you should find the things you need. Biggest changes are\n- YLabels now called YAxis (same goes for x-labels)\n- Grid lines, and range of the chart now controlled via axis\n- More customization through the data objects\n. Yes, you can simply increase the top-space on the axis: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-(YLabels)\njava\nchart.getAxisLeft().setSpaceTop(25f);\n. This issue is not related to the library.\nThis is an issue in the implementation of your multi-layout (items of different classes) ListView that causes a ClassCastException when the listview recycles its childs.\nTake a look at the example project and see how I implemented a multi-layout listview.\nEspecially on these methods in the adapter:\n``` java\n       @Override\n        public int getItemViewType(int position) { ... }\n    @Override\n    public int getViewTypeCount() { ... }\n\n```\nTutorial: http://www.survivingwithandroid.com/2014/08/android-listview-with-multiple-row.html\n. Documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/XAxis-%28XLabels%29\nIf you want the x-axis to appear on both sides, call:\nchart.getXAxis().setPosition(XAxisPosition.BOTH_SIDED);\n. Which version are you using?\n. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce your issue. I have tried in the example app with the DynamicalDataAddingActivity and there it works fine: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/DynamicalAddingActivity.java\nTry with in-commenting this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/DynamicalAddingActivity.java#L74-78\n. The little change I just made should fix this, please try.\n. Please post your full chart setup.\n. I would really love to merge it, but I have already tried it and it's unfortunately not very good concerning performance. I decided to leave this open as it is really something I want for this library.\nAlso, in android there are other, more common ways of achieving a fling effect, but they require more effort to implement.\nTo be more specific, I am talking about this example from Google.\nPlease note the used OverScroller class in that example.\n. Have a look at the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-(YLabels)\nSpecifically, these four methods:\n- setAxisMaxValue(float max): Set a custom maximum value for this axis. If set, this value will not be calculated automatically depending on the provided data. \n- setAxisMinValue(float min): Set a custom minimum value for this axis. If set, this value will not be calculated automatically depending on the provided data. \n- setSpaceTop(float percent): Sets the top spacing (in percent of the total axis-range) of the highest value in the chart in comparison to the highest value on the axis. \n- setSpaceBottom(float percent): Sets the bottom spacing (in percent of the total axis-range) of the lowest value in the chart in comparison to the lowest value on the axis. \nAlso, be aware of setStartAtZero(...)\n. What do you mean by inidcators exactly?\n. Thats basic listview stuff and has nothing to do with the lib. Just call notifyDataSetChanged() on your adapter.\n. Did you also call\nchart.setDrawGridBackground(false)\nIt's in the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Getting-Started\n. Yes please I'd like to see a picture :-)\nI cannot remember that the transparent circle was ever animated^^\n. I just pushed a little fix, if you want you can try the latest master commit and see if it works now.\n. No, that is not possible because they are just strings rendered to the canvas, and no actual views.\nHowever, you can add a OnChartGestureListener and then determine the position that was e.g. single tapped.\n. Currently there is no option to set a shader for a specific dataset. But I will consider adding that in the future.\n. http://www.polyglotprogramminginc.com/adding-gradients-to-android-graphs-with-mpandroidchart-and-decoview/\n. setFillDrawable(Drawable d): Sets a Drawable that should cover the fill-area. This also allows to use gradients.\n. I'm not exactly sure what you mean? Could you provide an example?\n. Sorry but I somehow can't access the file :-)\n. Thanks, and unfortunately that is not possible yet. You will have to code that yourself somehow.\n. Currently not supported.\n. Are you using a custom format for the displayed entry value?\n. Now I see. You did not set the axis-dependency for your dataset. Set it to AxisDependency.RIGHT\n. \"the graph behaves strange\" - what does that mean?\nWhat exactly do you want?\nDisplay 100 values maximum, then remove from the start and add to the end?\n. Since you are removing values upon overflow, the methods setVisibleXRange(...) and moveViewToX(...) do not really make sense in your case.\nTry removing those methods and call invalidate() on the chart upon each new entry added (after calling notifyDataSetChanged().\n. Yes, you need to get the description Paint and then can change the color:\njava\nPaint p = chart.getPaint(Chart.PAINT_DESCRIPTION);\np.setColor(...);\nConcerning the position, there is currently no option to change that.\n. Update: I just added some methods that should allow that:\n- setDescriptionPosition(...)\n- setDescriptionColor(...)\n. Just set two entries to the same x-coordinate?\nnew Entry(50f, 1);\nnew Entry(60f, 1);\nwill result in a step from 50 to 60.\n. I don't understand what exactly your problem is?\n. Post your full xml and chart setup.\n. This is already in development: #106 \n. Now available chart.setHighlightPerDragEnabled(boolean enabled)\n. I'm not sure what you mean, but check out the documentation concerning interaction with the chart: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\nMaybe calling setPinchZoom(false) solves your problem.\n. Your images are not uploading as it seems, can you retry\n. Okay, the issue here is that you are using one of those (or all of those attributes: android:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize\"\nThis bug is already fixed in the latest commit to the master branch, but not fixed in release v2.0.9.\nIt will be included in the next release version 2.1.0\n. Probably end of this of beginning next week.\n. You do not need a separate dataset for every column (like \"api/sys/salt_rsa\"). You just need as many\ndatasets as you want separate entries for each column. Each column simply represents a different x-index.\n. This is not some kind of gradle support platform.\nAll information that is needed to use this project as a gradle dependency is provided in the readme. With that information, the majority of users get it to work. The ones that don't will have to invest some of their own time and figure it out.\n. Here is the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Colors\nIn short: Just create your different BarDataSets, and then add the colors you want\nIts also in the example project.\n. This is not an issue related to the library.\nI suggest you read this article on how to work with Android Activity: http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html\n. #517 \n. That's exatly how it's supposed to look.\nNow set the barspace to zero and the top space (space between largest bar and top of chart-view) and it should all be gone.\n. Documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Specific-chart-settings\n. @dbleicher you have more or less understood the problem correctly. However, upon e.g. setting up a View inside lets say the onCreate(...) method of an Activity, it automatically gets rendered, I cannot change that.\nThere is no internal method inside the chart that triggers the rendering e.g. when the data is set.\nIf you would add a delay to setting the data (for example 1 second), and then set the data and do not call the invalidate() method, nothing should be rendered.\nAnd rendering causes the data (as you said correctly), to recalculate all values (also the legend), and this is why your custom set legend entries are overwritten by the recalculation.\nOf course this could be solved via some kind of boolean flag like \"ifcustomlegendset then dont recalculate\" but this is in my opinion a very ugly workaround.\nIf someone could find a nice and clean solution for this or show me a way of preventing the view from being rendered upon setting it up, I would very much appreicate it :-)\n. Now possible.\n. PieChart cannot be zoomed.\n. Scrolling / Zooming / Panning / Dragging is possible.\nFor setting the bar-width, use:\nbarDataSet.setBarSpace(...);\n. Have a look at the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki\ndataSet.setDrawValues(false)\n. Check out the FillFormatter. It allows you to customize where the filling line should end.\n. This sets the number of labels that are plotted. If set to 100, and more than 100 values are in the chart, no more value labels will be displayed.\nI think you should look into this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Currently it's not possible to restrict the maximum zoom level.\n. Yes, check out the ValueFormatter (or the predefined PercentFormatter for formatting the y-values (and adding %).\nFor the x-values, just add % to the String.\nIt's also in the piechart of the example project.\n. Ok, then let the original value (yvalue, e.g. \"523\") be as it is.\nAnd for the x-labels string array, calculate the percentages.\n. Okay, what happened? Error message?\n. That is because you just pulled the latest commit on the master branch that is not yet in any release version. v2.0.9 does not contain the fix I described.\n. Show me your implementation please\n. The implementation of the custom-marker.\n. Wow, this looks fantastic, I'm already eager to try this out! Thank you! :-) \n. Yep, already on it :-)\nI'll post the screenshots as soon as it's in a release version, so probably sometime next week.\nI just tried them out and they look cool. I have a question concerning the size of the circles: How exactly is the actual size when drawn determined?\n. I have discovered a minor issue with the bubble sizes.\nIt seems the sizes are calculated correctly when the chart is in portrait mode (height > width) but when the chart is in landscape mode (width > height) the bubble sizes are too small.\nYou can observe this in the example of the bubble chart.\n. What do you think of this approach?\n``` java\nprotected void drawDataSet(Canvas c, BubbleDataSet dataSet) {\n    Transformer trans = mChart.getTransformer(dataSet.getAxisDependency());\n\n    float phaseX = mAnimator.getPhaseX();\n    float phaseY = mAnimator.getPhaseY();\n\n    List<BubbleEntry> entries = dataSet.getYVals();\n\n    Entry entryFrom = dataSet.getEntryForXIndex(mMinX);\n    Entry entryTo = dataSet.getEntryForXIndex(mMaxX);\n\n    int minx = Math.max(dataSet.getEntryPosition(entryFrom), 0);\n    int maxx = Math.min(dataSet.getEntryPosition(entryTo) + 1, entries.size());\n\n    widthBuffer[0] = 0f;\n    widthBuffer[2] = 1f;\n    trans.pointValuesToPixel(widthBuffer);\n\n    // calcualte the full width of 1 step on the x-axis\n    final float maxBubbleWidth = widthBuffer[2] - widthBuffer[0];\n\n    for (int j = minx; j < maxx; j++) {\n\n        final BubbleEntry entry = entries.get(j);\n\n        pointBuffer[0] = (float) (entry.getXIndex() - minx) * phaseX + (float) minx;\n        pointBuffer[1] = (float) (entry.getVal()) * phaseY;\n        trans.pointValuesToPixel(pointBuffer);\n\n        final float maxSize = (dataSet.getMaxSize() != 0f) ? dataSet.getMaxSize() : 1.0f;\n        final float factor = entry.getSize() / maxSize;\n        final float shapeHalf = (maxBubbleWidth * factor) / 2f;\n\n        if (!mViewPortHandler.isInBoundsY(pointBuffer[1]))\n            continue;\n\n        final int color = dataSet.getColor(entry.getXIndex());\n\n        mRenderPaint.setColor(color);\n        c.drawCircle(pointBuffer[0], pointBuffer[1], shapeHalf, mRenderPaint);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nWhat this basically does is calculate the maximum width the bubble can have on the x-axis (1 step), and then scale all smaller bubbles down.\nOne other thing I have noticed is that the maximum size value is only DataSet specific, and not for the whole data object. Which means that a bubble-size of 100 in one dataset could be equally sized to a bubble size of 10 in another dataset, assuming that they are the maximum values in each dataset. Is that correct, or should there be a global (across all data) maximum?\n. What do you think of this approach?\n``` java\nprotected void drawDataSet(Canvas c, BubbleDataSet dataSet) {\n    Transformer trans = mChart.getTransformer(dataSet.getAxisDependency());\n\n    float phaseX = mAnimator.getPhaseX();\n    float phaseY = mAnimator.getPhaseY();\n\n    List<BubbleEntry> entries = dataSet.getYVals();\n\n    Entry entryFrom = dataSet.getEntryForXIndex(mMinX);\n    Entry entryTo = dataSet.getEntryForXIndex(mMaxX);\n\n    int minx = Math.max(dataSet.getEntryPosition(entryFrom), 0);\n    int maxx = Math.min(dataSet.getEntryPosition(entryTo) + 1, entries.size());\n\n    widthBuffer[0] = 0f;\n    widthBuffer[2] = 1f;\n    trans.pointValuesToPixel(widthBuffer);\n\n    // calcualte the full width of 1 step on the x-axis\n    final float maxBubbleWidth = widthBuffer[2] - widthBuffer[0];\n\n    for (int j = minx; j < maxx; j++) {\n\n        final BubbleEntry entry = entries.get(j);\n\n        pointBuffer[0] = (float) (entry.getXIndex() - minx) * phaseX + (float) minx;\n        pointBuffer[1] = (float) (entry.getVal()) * phaseY;\n        trans.pointValuesToPixel(pointBuffer);\n\n        final float maxSize = (dataSet.getMaxSize() != 0f) ? dataSet.getMaxSize() : 1.0f;\n        final float factor = entry.getSize() / maxSize;\n        final float shapeHalf = (maxBubbleWidth * factor) / 2f;\n\n        if (!mViewPortHandler.isInBoundsY(pointBuffer[1]))\n            continue;\n\n        final int color = dataSet.getColor(entry.getXIndex());\n\n        mRenderPaint.setColor(color);\n        c.drawCircle(pointBuffer[0], pointBuffer[1], shapeHalf, mRenderPaint);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nWhat this basically does is calculate the maximum width the bubble can have on the x-axis (1 step), and then scale all smaller bubbles down.\nOne other thing I have noticed is that the maximum size value is only DataSet specific, and not for the whole data object. Which means that a bubble-size of 100 in one dataset could be equally sized to a bubble size of 10 in another dataset, assuming that they are the maximum values in each dataset. Is that correct, or should there be a global (across all data) maximum?\n. Well the overflow thing is also an issue yes. Why exaclty does the size have to be sqrt`ed?\n. Okay, I have made some adjustments and it now takes width and height into consideration but fully scaling up even in landscape mode.\nI think we are ready for a new release, what do you say?\n. Yep I did (or I think I did), I am not that familiar with Bubble-charts so wont do any harm if you take a second look at it. :-)\n. By the way: Have you recently checked the ios-charts tag I created on stackoverflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios-charts\nIt's already getting a lot of attention and should boost the popularity of the library.\n. You mean that the bubbles get bigger?\nUpon zooming?\n. They always occupy a maximum of exactly 1 step on the x-axis.\n. As soon as the y-axis becomes the limiting factor, it takes over.\n. Well I see what you mean. How would you change it?\nBut when I zoom the x-axis only, it limits up to a point, and then the y-axis limits.\n. You can observe it when the bubbles are suddenly significantly smaller than 1 step on the x-axis.\n. But thats only in landscape mode i see.\n. Well with the transformer you can transform the bounds of the viewport (top and bottom) to y-values, and then derive the currently visible range from them\n. It doesn't contain information, but it can calculate the y-position the top and bottom edge of the chart would have. You understand what I mean?\n. Please try what I just pushed. I'm not sure but maybe this is what you meant :-)\n. I resetted them because it immediately crashed when I started the bubble demo \ud83d\ude0a\n. Weird, Ill test it again \ud83d\udc4c\n. You coded from-to, isn't it to-from? That's the reason it crashed, I'll change it.\n. Good idea. I started this about a year ago, but was too busy doing other things so I never had the change to finish it. But would definitely be a great idea.\n. Okay new release is out :-)\nNext things on my list would be the following (big) topics:\n- getting away from x-axis indices (instead double)\n- y-values as double\n- approximation\n. Take a look at the wiki: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Are the values below 0?\nIf so, call leftAxis.setStartAtZero(false) & rightAxis.setStartAtZero(false)\n. Please look at the example project. The issue is that you are not setting the data correctly. Wich each call of setData(...) you are only setting one entry for the chart, and of course overwriting all others.\nPut all the entries you want to display in one dataSet and add that to the chart.\n. This is what I expected! Nothing more to say than GREAT JOB!\n. Maybe there is some improvement potential for the PieChart and RadarChart in terms of expected behaviour. It seems like sometimes the deceleration triggers into the opposite direction of the fling gesture.\nBut other than that, I could not see any issues even on lower android versions. :+1: \n. Yes, I saw your comments in code about that.\nIf the \"mRotationAngle\" property is increased, the chart will move clockwise.\n. You are talking about a stacked-barchart: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/StackedBarActivity.java\nTherefore, you need only one DataSet, containing 3 entries, each with 2 values. This is how you create an entry with 2 values:\nBarEntry e = new BarEntry(new float[] { 10f, 15f }, xIndex);\n. Yes of course, just put your values in different entries.\n. If you want 2 individual bars per x value, place the entries for the values in different datasets. If you want 2 individual values per entry, stack them like I showed you.\n. Sure it can :-D\nJust do it. Multiple datasets, with entries each containing multiple values.\n. Currently, you can't. Im working on it.\n. Try this:\njava\nXAxis x = chart.getXAxis();\nx.setPosition(XAxisPosition.BOTTOM_INSIDE);\n. Yes: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Sorry, heatmaps are not supported.\n. Finger drawing is currently not possible.\n. Sorry, I don't understand. What do you mean by \"the previous with\"?\n. I just pushed a \"maybe\" fix, please try again and let me know :-)\n. getYChartMax() returns the maximum value the YAxis can display.\nIf you just want the highest value that is displayed in the chart, call getYMax() on your data object.\n. Well for the shadow that is not possible, but you can set it for the body: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/CandleStickChartActivity.java\n. - YAxis\n- ValueFormatter\n. It's intentional.\nThe thing is that the center of the first bar in the barchart is always at x-index 0. This kind of \"shifts\" the barchart to the right in comparison to the linechart.\nIt's also obvious because at some point, a barchart with 4 entries needs to be exactly 1 entry bigger than a linechart with 4 entries, because it each bar covers space.\n. Just rotate the View in xml (rotation in degrees):\nxml\n <com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.LineChart\n        android:id=\"@+id/chart\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:rotation=\"90\" />\n. This method is for highlighting a single value, what you are doing (with your loop) is overwriting every previous statement.\nThere is a specific call for highlighting multiple values: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Hmmm that  is weird, but I guess than you have to avoid the asynctask :-)\n. Yes, that is possiblie :-) \n. I suggest you use a shorter text then.\n. Try setting setHighlightPerDragEnabled(boolean enabled) to false.\n. Dont create duplicate issues\n. It can't, because then valuesToHighlight() will return false.\n. The LimitLine is still available.\n. You are missing something.\nLimitLines are now handled by the Axis, and no longer by the ChartData object.\nYou can read that in the documentation\u00a0or check the example.\n. Well said Daniel :-), could not agree more!\n. The error message you are getting pretty much says it all.\nThe x-values array you are providing for your data needs to be at least as long as the highest x-index that you want to display in the chart.\n. Nothing happens beacuse this is not a zoom method. It just restrains the maximum visible area.\n. Image1: Use 2 different datasets\nImage2: Use 1 DataSet and the FillFormatter\n. lineDataSet.setFillColor(...)\n. Are they nested in a LinearLayout using the weight attribute?\n. Use a horizontal linearlayout, and give each chart a weight of 1. Tell me what happens.\n. Yes, that is common ListView behaviour as the ListView recycles it's children instead of recreating them everytime you scroll over them.\nIf you unhiglight in every call of getView(...) and reset all scaling and dragging, this will no longer occur.\n. What do you mean by \"is not working\"?\n. Do you have more than 10 values in the chart?\n. I honestly don't know. Study the examples.\n. Try setDoubleTapToZoomEnabled(boolean enabled)\n. - Use ValueFormatter to cut off decimals\n- Use setAxisMaxValue(...) and setAxisMinValue(...) to adjust your axis range\n- Use setLabelCount(...) and set as many labels as you need\n. Are you calling invalidate() after making changes?\n. Post the code you use to setup the chart and change the text size\n. Okay, and where is you call to setData(...) and then your call of invalidate()?\n. Why are you creating 4 different LineData objects?\nAlso, your pulse data text size is set to 10f instead of 12f\n. Also, your pulse data text size is set to 10f instead of 12f\n. Try calling setContentView(...) somewhere earlier.\n. Ok now I know what the issue is.\nYou either need to call Utils.init(...) sometime before setting up your LineData or move the creation of the chart before it.\n. - realtime data documentation\n- realtime data example\n. Call setMaxVisibleValueCount(10000)\n. That is not supported yet, you will have to do it yourself\n. Thanks! It's changed.\n. What you want is currently not really supported. It's not possible to set the values of the y-axis exactly to your needs.\nWhat you could try (and this is a very hacky solution) is modify the public float[] mEntries property of the YAxis and set the labels you want. But I am not sure myself if this will work :-D\n. Unfortunately this is currently not possible. However it should not be too hard to modify the library to achieve this if you want.\n. Are you using the barchart?\n. sure you can new Entry(1, xindex)\n. Read the documentation of the YAxis.\nFocus on the following methods:\n- setStartAtZero(...)\n- setAxisMaxValue(...) & setAxisMinValue(...)\n- setSpaceTop(...)\n- setSpaceBottom(...)\nAnd this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nAnd this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. Maybe you can find something here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Try calling notifyDataSetChanged() right before invalidate in your displayChart() method.\n. Are you still experiencing this issue with newer versions of the library?\nI did some fixes in that direction.\n. Don't create duplicate issues. I do not have the time to answer questions from authors who don't even want to invest half a minute to understandably describe their problem and do not support this project in any way.\nIf you dont want to show values, don't add them until you want to show them.\n. I just merged the PR with some modifications into the experimental branch.\nYou can check it out there. I didn't really like that the integration of the images was tied to the x-axis. It like it more to have aPieEntrywith a separate constructor that allows to add bitmaps.\n. What aboutsetVisibleYRange(...)? https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Can you in short explain what that feature does?\n. I like the feature, but maybe we can include this more into theViewPortHandler?\n. I see it, im just evaluating :-)\nI will merge it asap :-)\n. How does this interact with the already existingsetViewPortOffsets(...)method?\n. Okay, I see. Makes sense.\n. So you disabled the legend?chart.getLengend().setEnabled(false)`\nMaybe you can try setting custom offsets to 0:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nCheck out the setViewPortOffsets(...) method.\n. Ow yea haha :-D\nIt has gotten so complex I dont even know my own library anymore. Could you post a screenshot of the problem?\n. Hmmm, have you tried centering the chart into the parent layout via xml?\n. Be more clear.\n. Keyword \"highlighting\": https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Honestly I dont know. I just know it works in the example. Maybe you can study it and see if you are doing anything differently.\n. chart.getLegend().setEnabled(false)\n. Can't this be done with the valueformatter?\njava\nif(value <= 0f) return \"\";\n. This has been asked a thousand times, and it's int he documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Specific-chart-settings\npieChart.setDrawSliceText(false)\n. Thanks, looks good, I'll test it! :-)\n. Just tested it and works like a charm, very good.\nThere are some minor issues with the PieChart causing the legend to overlap with the chart if placed on the right, but this was an issue that has existed before.\n. Are you plotting your data against the right axis?\ndataSet.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.RIGHT)\nBecause default is left.\nAlso, it makes no sense to disable the left axis and then afterwards set various properties for it which will not take effect since the axis is disabled.\n. Short question concerning this:\njava\n    public void setVisibleXRange(float minScaleX, float maxScaleX) {\n        float maxScale = mDeltaX / minScaleX;\n        float minScale = mDeltaX / maxScaleX;\n        mViewPortHandler.setScaleXRange(minScaleX, maxScaleX);\n     }\nShouldn't it be like this:\njava\n    public void setVisibleXRange(float minScaleX, float maxScaleX) {\n        float maxScale = mDeltaX / minScaleX;\n        float minScale = mDeltaX / maxScaleX;\n        mViewPortHandler.setScaleXRange(minScale, maxScale);\n     }\n?\n. If yes, I'll change it :-)\n. Nah thats not what I meant, its about the parameter and the local variable\n. So highlighting can now be set via dataset?\nAnd there is still a \"global\" highlight flag for the chart? I think we can also remove that one then :-)\n. Ah I see it's gone as well!\n. #513 \n. You will have to rewrite the library to your needs to achieve this.\n. Yes, that seems like the reason why it's not working for some people, if by \"not ordered\" you mean \"not ordered by x-index\" (ascending).\nFrom what I have noticed, the matrix multiplications are not that time consuming. It's more the additional boundary checks and general runs through the drawing loops that decrease performance.\nI will do some extensive testing in the following days and then report back.\nIf performance is too bad when the checks are removed, I suggest we stick with the option that the entries need to be ordered by x-index, what do you think Daniel?\n. To be honest I think I already know that performance will be much worse if the checks are removed :-)\nI will test it anyway, but I think its better to require the entries to be sorted.\n. It's a protected variable inherited from the baseclass.\n. If no specific height is set, the chart will now have a height of 50dp.\n. I see your problem but unfortunately this requires huge changes that are currently not suitable. There are hundreds (if not thousands) of people using this library, and I cannot make changes like that just for the sake of one person, since this would most likely interfere with the implementation of other users.\n. Yes, that method is actually \"not that clear\" for the barchart in case there are multiple datasets.\nYou will have to consider the following factors:\n- each bar exactly uses a space of 1 (the width of the bar + barspace)\n- the groupspace, which is set for the BarData object and separates \"groups\" of bars\n- the barchart starts at -0.5x (thats just a guess :-))\n. I have no idea, this is more a general android question than something related to the library. Maybe you did not reference the dependency correctly.\n. You cannot set the grid-background to dashed, since the background is just an area behind the grid.\nWhat you can do is set the grid lines to dashed, and that can be done via the different axes: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis\n. Post a screenshot.\nAlso, call rightAxis.setStartAtZero(false)\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\nhighlightValues(null)\n. Are you using the latest version 2.1.0?\n. Are you working with the listeners and calling the zoom method upon translating?\n. Yes a video would be great\n. There is no way to rotate the labels. With xAxis.setLabelsToSkip(0) you can force draw all labels, but then they might overlap.\n. provide code\n. call invalidate() after all setup\n. 1. you can do that via XAxis and YAxis\n2. that is the label you provided for your dataset, provide \"\" and it will be gone\n3. you cannot, since the axes have different scaling. what you can do is hide the line on one of the axes and/or reduce the number of labels used for the right axis\nHere is the documentation.\n. I no longer understand where the problem is to be honest\n. chart.getLegend().setEnabled(false)\nyAxis.enableGridDashedLine(10f,10f,0f)\n. related to  #718\n. Thank you for your pull request, but this is a functionality that I do not want to handle via dataset.\nIf someone wants to invert the filled line, he can do so by creating a custom implementation of the FillFormatter.\nIf you would like to have this feature in the library, I will of course accept a pull request that includes an implementation of the FillFormatter that inverts the fill line, called e.g. InvertedFillFormatter\n. a9cb766310048db828a5d741095e2911c0f9809f\nNow possible.\nWiki: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/FillFormatter\n. provide screenshots\n. rightAxis.enableGridDashedLine(...)\nleftAxis.enableGridDashedLine(...)\nxAxis.enableGridDashedLine(...)\n. Thanks for letting me know what I do wrong. Some people really seem to be stupid enough to think that I don't have anything better to do than answering questions all day long that have been asked multiple times all over again for free. So yes, sometimes my answers are short, and issues are closed quickly. In the meantime, there is no appreciation that this an open source project free for everybody to use. Btw, this has already been fixed #755\n. Yes, that is possible:\njava\n        dataSet.setDecreasingColor(Color.RED);\n        dataSet.setDecreasingPaintStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);\n        dataSet.setIncreasingColor(Color.rgb(122, 242, 84));\n        dataSet.setIncreasingPaintStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);\n. given the information you provided me with, I have no idea - you probably forgot to set the listener to the seekbar or something\n. given the information you provided me with, I have no idea - you probably forgot to set the listener to the seekbar or something\n. 034e05997d2fad20d8b1a764b651b66483f713f4\n. What exactly does that do? :-)\n. Allright, got it, nice fix! \n. Having two (or more) labels inside each bar will require customization, so I don't think that the scenario you are trying to achieve is possible by default.\nWhat you will have to do is modify the library to your needs. Things such as setting different text sizes are already supported.\n. Well most of your customizations will happen in the HorizontalBarChartRenderer class.\nFor the grey border I'd simply draw another rectangle over the actual bar with paint-style STROKE instead of FILL.\nFor the labels, check the drawValues(...) method inside the renderer.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-%28YLabels%29\n. Interesting, I will look into it.\nCould you provide me with the animations you are using?\n. The way I see it this does not require any additional implementation, since the Heikin-Ashi simply modifies the values, but other than that works like a normal candle-stick chart. All you have to do is provide the modified values in the constructor.\n. Honestly I am not that good with the different financial charts, but what exactly is the difference between the current candlestick and an OHCL chart?\n. In the latest commit I provided a method called setXAxisRenderer(...) this is where you can set your custom renderer. \nYou need to provide chart.getViewPortHandler() for the constructor of the renderer.\nDon't forget to invalidate() the chart upon setting a new renderer.\n. Honestly I think that you cannot save the chart directly after first drawing it. I think the drawing routine is not finished yet and therefore causes the exception upon save.\nYou need to somehow delay the saving at  least a little bit.\n. The problem is your legend.setColors(...). There you only should set the 4 colors that go along with the labels, not your full colors array.\n. Ow I see you are using the wrong method. Try legend.setCustom(...) it's in the documentation of the legend.\n. Which version are you using? The latest 2.1.0?\nIf so, then this has not been in a release yet, if not, update to the latest version.\n. No, that will not do anything good. You will have to wait until there is a release 2.1.1 in which the methods mentioned before are included.\n. It's currently not possible to set a custom bar width, but I am working on providing such a feature in the future.\n. Try chart.setViewPortOffsets(0,0,0,0)\n. #740 \n. Thank you for the suggestion, but I am currently busy with other thinks and not going to implement something like this in near future!\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. You can set the maximum via YAxis. Concerning the integers, use the ValueFormatter to remove decimals.\n. Are you doing anything different than this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/DynamicalAddingActivity.java ?\nBecause there it is working.\n. Hmmmm that's weird.\nIs your chart in a regular activity? Or inside some fragment or custom view?\n. Yes, that could be an issue, I will look into it\n. Please have another go at it now, I just pushed the (a possible) fix.\n. 1) Documentation of the YAxis\n2) Formatting Values\n3) enableGridDashedLine(....) has three parameters, the third one defines the phase / offset which will allow to move the starting point of the \"dash\"\n. Which version are you using?\n. Thank you for your input, this is related to  #718\nI am working on it!\n. Can you post a screenshot?\n. Okay, could you provide the code where you setup the chart?\n. Unfortunately I am not able to reproduce the issue, for me it works :-)\nWhat could be the issue is that you are overwriting each dataset upon creation.\nAre you using the latest version of the lib?\n. Actually, the release is outdated, the wiki is not.\nThe methods you mentioned are not in a release version yet, thus, you cannot find them if you use a release version.\n. Check out how to set colors, this will help you use just one DataSet and the colors you want.\n. No, that is not the intended use. These methods will be deprecated in the next release.\nOn the latest commit on the master branch, there is already a method called setCustom(...) which allows to set custom labels and colors for the legend.\nThis method however is not in any release yet (it will be in the next). So you will have to either clone the repo or wait until the next release (which will be soon).\n. If you need it, im just fine with you modifying the library to your needs. However, this is not how a BubbleChart is supposed to be and expected to look like.\nSo I will not add this. Thank you anyway!\n. This is not in a release yet, you have to wait until it is released.\nThe methods can only be found in the latest commit of the master branch.\n. Thanks!\n. You are welcome to make a PR for this, unfortunately I currently do not have the time to do this.\n. You set the maximum visible range to 30, and use the zoom methods to zoom to 10 values.\n. Provide code\n. Well you can do the following to prevent that:\n- make your x-values array larger and by that give the chart more space on the left and right\n- implement some logic in the markerview that will shift it to the left/right depending on the selected x-index\n. setDragOffsetX(..)? setDragOffsetY(...)?\n. (low + high) / 2 :-D\n. Just name your x-axis labels according to the dates (days, months, years) you need.\n. What you can do:\n- increase your x-axis range, making more space for the marker\n- increase the charts left and right offset\n- write some kind of logic in your marker that prevents this from happening\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nmoveViewToX(...)\n. Set this \"01/01/2001\"  and so on as an x-axis label, place your values to the correct x-indices\n. @silviul Did you do that for Shazam? Or something else?\n. it's a demo\n. Multiple x-axis not yet supported. What you can do is plot the same x-axis on top and bottom.\n. atm only right, left and below\n. I'd take this to stackoverflow.\n. I honestly have no idea since I cannot know what kind of data is in your cursor and what chart you would expect. If it's not displaying as you expect, I suppose it might be related to soal_salah[i]\n. IN the code above, you are displaying soal_salah as the y-value\n. This seems like not that many changes, I can't believe that works already. :-)\nDid you base this on my code? I thought I was further away from a stable solution^^\n. Sounds great!\nDid you check out the age distribution charts that are now possible with this? Looks kind of fancy :-)\nBut there are still issues concerning highlighting unfortunately...\n. please tell me that I did not just push the images stuff to master again\n. I got kind of scared because I saw XValue. So this was in the master branch all along?\n. I think I didn't checkout the clean origin master, instead I pulled which was bad since I still had the pie-stuff at master locally :-)\nYou mean re-merge the PR you just made?\n. done\n. Im currently working on negative bar-stacks & the related highlighting issues. I guess after that is finished there is gonna be a new release (since I'm very busy right now, it's gonna be in approximately 2 weeks)\n. Yep, I'll probably look over the other code this weekend and then do the release, thanks for the PR :-)\n. I see your point, it just looked so good before :-)\n. The fix in general is good and will exactly result in the behavior you want. But please keep in mind that this will (can) have a negative impact on performance since values that are outside of the view (when the chart is zoomed in) are still rendered using this approach even though they are not visible.\nHowever this should not be an issue for up to ~300-500 values in the linechart, depending on your device.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947603/setbackground-vs-setbackgrounddrawable-android\n. Currently, only float is supported so you will have to somehow convert it to it.\nI see that this is going to be difficult / impossible considering the value you posted, but thats all I can say really :-)\n. You are getting a nullpointer exception, so obviously, your lchart is null.\nYou need to figure out why that happens (e.g. wrong .xml file)\n. I have no idea, your explaination is far from clear...\n. One approach could be that you use a separate DataSet that has circles enabled and that is only displayed if something is selected.\n.

No, there is no other way\n. Yep, looks good! Thank you!\n. There is a null check for the mBitmapCanvas and a very good reason for doing this. (related to path size issues)\n. Your charts height is greater than the width -> then you rotate -> then obviously the chart is too wide -> you need the height of the chart to be equal or smaller than the width\n. you disabled the right axis so it cannot work\n. Okay, then I would check the x-indices you are using and make sure they are correct\n-> check the date on your x-axis -> in one image the range is dec13 to oct14 and on the other image it's \"doubled\".\nIt seems like you are adding your x-values twice, which is wrong.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Hmmm yea there is not much I can do about this, you will have to modify the library and apply some kind of fix I suppose \n. Stacked bars are supported, 3D bars are not.\n. I'd have a look at this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-%28YLabels%29\nIf you are only providing me with information like \"it did not work\" I'm afraid I cant help you out.\n.

YOu will have to implement a solution yourself or avoid drawing values that are too small\n. Which library version are you using?\nWhich device did that issue occur on?\nWhich Android version does the device have?\n. I don't understand. Can you show some code?\n. There sure is a way, you will just have to look deeper into the code and see why it is not working.\nBy default, left aligned x-axis labels are not possible.\n. thx!\n. I think this is your issue: \nyVals.add(new BarEntry(barObject.value, i));\nI needs to be incremented in each run through your foreach loop.\n. In the video it looks like you already set a custom offset and upon touching the custom offset is reset to default.\nIf you cannot show me more code there is not much more I can do.\nHave you tried calling invalidate() on the chart after setting the offsets?\n. No, gradients are not supported by default\n. Use one DataSet to represent the red line in the first picture, and set it to filled.\nUse a second DataSet to represent the blue line.\n. That is currently not possible by default!\n. Can you show your code of toggling the datasets?\n. Yes, I am. There are some minor things that still need fixing, but I am thinking about releasing this weekend.\n. v2.1.3 out now\n. Remove all the offsets and give it some right margin.\n. This is not a memory leak, it's simply a Bitmap that uses a lot of memory.\nHowever, it's no longer needed and therefore I removed it.\n. currently not possible\n. java\npieChart.setTransparentCircleColor(Color.WHITE);\npieChart.setTransparentCircleAlpha(255); // fully opaque\nWhat you are using is 'slicespace' which has nothing to do with the inner circle.\n. Add some more digits to the ValueFormatter you are using.\n. Just add an empty value \"\" to the x-values array \n\"\" \"\" \"Jan\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"Feb\" \"\" \"\" \nLike this :-)\n. Then you should not add empty datasets\n. in that case, call notifyDataSetChanged() on the chart after adding\n. that is still work in progress\n. Check out the FillFormatter and lineDataSet.setDrawFilled(true)\n. Hmm I will have to look deeper into this. Which version of the lib are you using?\nAs a temproary workaround, simply call setNoDataText(\"\") on the chart to get rid of the text.\n. do you have overlapping layouts or activities? show your xml\n. The message says it. Your x-values array is too short to display all the values you specified.\n. Read the documentation concerning highlighting, that should help you.\n. I am afraid it will not be that easy since the valueformatter interface is tightly intergrated into the library. You will have to find a solution yourself to use spannablestringbuilder or go with string.\n. I suppose somewhere in your code you are calling xAxis.setEnabled(false) since the axis is not showing.\n. It is possible to get the selected color, because the xIndex of the selected entry correspons to the index of the color in the colors array you set for the chart.\nint selectedColor = colorsArray.get(e.getXIndex())\n. Well, the chart draws some things on a bitmap and then draws the bitmap.\nThere is obviously not enough memory on your device at time of chart render to do that, thats why it crashes.\n. I'll probably add something like that to the example app, where it then can be observed.\n. This might be what you are looking for: https://github.com/PhilJay/ValueBar\n. Yes, I am going to push in 5 min :-)\n. Yes, I am going to push in 5 min :-)\n. currently not supported\n. dont do this:\nmChart.moveViewToX(mChart.getData().getXValCount() - 121);\nmChart.notifyDataSetChanged();\ndo this:\nmChart.notifyDataSetChanged();\nmChart.moveViewToX(mChart.getData().getXValCount() - 121);\n. use HorizontalBarChart for horizontal bars, BarChart for vertical bars\n. Now supported.\n. 75be29ef038f960b686430ab8a75dff89575c6ac\n. I'm no longer sure if I should merge this?\nIs this working or will it mess everything up?\nAnd what feature exactly got added here?\n. Alright, thank you!\n. This is now fixed, also, read the bottom few lines of this: \nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\n. Alternatively you could disable the charts dragging capabilities after zooming in, this would allow highlighting via drag.\n. The OnChartGestureListener now provides a method called:\njava\nonChartGestureEnd(MotionEvent me, ChartTouchListener.ChartGesture lastPerformedGesture)\nThis method allows to react on gesture-end and provides the last performed gesture as a enum.\n. Currently not supported\n. Are you adding data dynamically?\nAnd if so, did you call notifyDataSetChanged() on the chart?\n. Its not clear to me how this issue can arise, but I have added bounds checks for the arrays that should prevent it.\n. I suppose the issue is now gone because you just fixed it by calling notifyDataSetChanged() beforehand!\n. Not by default.\nBut it should not be too hard to implement such a feature\n. Yes I made some changes but they should only give the chart default width and height of 50 or something when wrap_content is used as a parameter for height or width.\n. try getting your chart out of the scrollview\n. You obviously have some kind of issue with your layout.\nFor the chart to display like in your screenshot, it needs the height property wrap_content. If match_parent or a static height are set, this cannot occur.\n. Okay, could you try your layout like this (just copy paste it):\n``` xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\n. what crashes?\n. Yes, that is correct. Unfortunately there is no default mechanism to avoid this, you will have to modify the library to e.g. prevent some values from being drawn.\n. Looks like you have two datasets with the same color (yellow) overlapping.\n. Not yet possible, but I am considering to add this.\n. What you can do is create just one marker-view, and then, depending on which entry is selected display a different icon in it.\n. Rectangle currently not supported, but multiple entries can be highlighted.\n. id value = 0 -> don't add\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Colors\n. Not by default, you will have to modify the library to achieve this\n.moveViewTo(...)is what you are looking for. It's all in the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Did you test this?\nIf yes I'll merge :-)\n. You can use theValueFormatter` to do that. It's not as easy but overall allows much more flexibility.\nI just created a default formatter specifically for stacked values: StackedValueFormatter\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. (y) good solution!\n. As a matter of fact, I am already working on something like that (at least similar). It's not the adapter pattern, but I am planning on allowing to feed data to the chart via interfaces.\nSo what is then possible is that you implement the interface in your model class and will be able to feed the data for the chart directly from your model, without duplicating any data.\n. Yes!\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Custom-DataSets\n. Now available: pieChart.setMaxAngle(180f)\njava\n    /**\n     * Sets the max angle that is used for calculating the pie-circle. 360f means\n     * it's a full PieChart, 180f results in a half-pie-chart. Default: 360f\n     *\n     * @param maxangle min 90, max 360\n     */\n    public void setMaxAngle(float maxangle);\n. The feature is already in the latest master commit, but not released yet. That's why you cannot get it via gradle.\n. Did you call notifyDataSetChanged on the data object, or on the chart?\n. The setAxisDependency(...) method provided by the DataSet class lets you choose which axis your data should be plotted against.\nHere is an example where one dataset is plotted against the left and the other dataset is plotted against the right axis: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivity2.java\n. Update to latest version\n. xAxis.setDrawAxisLine(false)\n. Your labels are pretty long. And you cant have both equal spacing between all labels and still expect no label to exceed the bounds of the drawing area. The reason for that is that depending on the zoom level, a specific amount of labels is \"skipped\".\nsetLabelsToSkip(...) allows you to specify the number of labels not to be drawn before the next drawn label.\n. Are you adding data dynamically while rendering?\n. Are you calling notifyDataSetChanged() on the chart after adding?\nRead this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\n. moveViewToX will invalidate already, therefore you need to call notifyDataSetChanged() before\n. Yes, exactly!\n. Yes. This sould help you:\nsetLabelCount(int count, boolean force): Sets the number of labels for the y-axis. Be aware that this number is not fixed (if force == false) and can only be approximated. If force is enabled (true), then the exact specified label-count is drawn - this can lead to uneven numbers on the axis.\n. Currently not possible unfortunately.\n. Yes, use LimitLine\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis\n. gradients are not yet supported\n104\n430\n437\n834\n875\n893\nPlease do some research before asking!\nThank you.\n. Yes, of course it should not be too hard to get this!\n. http://www.polyglotprogramminginc.com/adding-gradients-to-android-graphs-with-mpandroidchart-and-decoview/\n. As of today, PieChart and HorizontalBarChart do not support MarkerView. THis is high on my list and will probably be added soon in the future.\n. It's just the same as a normal stacked barchart.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/StackedBarActivityNegative.java\n. That is because the axis in the example has a fixed limit:\njava\nmChart.getAxisRight().setAxisMaxValue(25f);\nmChart.getAxisRight().setAxisMinValue(-25f);\nRemove it and it will work.\n. Which issue exactly are you having? Based on the information you are providing I cannot do anything.\n. Show me how you set the data\n. Are you calling notifyDataSetChanged() on the chart after adding data dynamically? (and before refreshing)\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\n. Yes, the below type graph is possible. Use 1 LineDataSet and 1 BarDataSet.\n. The library is open source anyway. If you want you can just exclude the animation.* package that should do as well.\n. Currently I do not have the resources to do that, maybe I will add it in the future.\n. There is a way: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-(YLabels)\n. currently not supported\n. All possible, but you need to make your x-values array at least as long as many values you have in your biggest dataset.\n. You have startAtZero(true) in your code, which means that every value below zero will be cut off. In your case, values are not cut off but your line width is simply too high to be fully displayed. I suggest you either reduce your line width or let your axis start below zero.\n. I suggest you hard code the values and see if the plotted result is still wrong (which I doubt) and then look for an issue in your data model (your Bill object).\n. You probably added a null value to your x-values array. Provide \"\" instead.\n. Gradient below lines is currently not possible, but you can fill the area below a line with a specific color using setDrawFilled(true) and setFillColor(...).\nConcerning the custom color of your last point: A solution could be to put this point into a separate LineDataSet and apply your custom styling.\n. Not in the near future, but this might be something similar: https://github.com/PhilJay/CircleDisplay\n. Does this issue still persist since the latest commit I made?\n. Did you only test the 2.1.4 release or dis you use the code from the latest commit?\n. Okay, I'll look into it.\n. I have now tested this extensively using the cubic linechart from the example app. Unfortunately I am not able to reproduce the issue with different setup and data provided for the chart.\nThere have recently been changes to the line-renderer, so it is possible that this issue is resolved.\nCan anyone confirm that this issue is still present in the latest release v2.2.4?\n. I am not really sure what you mean.\nset.setDrawValues(false)\nset = new LineDataSet(yVals, \"\")\nchart.getLegend().setEnabled(false)\n. Hmmm, I will try to recreate the issue in my code. \nIn the meantime, could you tell me what happens if you don't use this line: setViewPortOffsets(0, 0, 0, 0);\n. Anything else messed up now?\nOr is it all good now?\nIf so, try calling this method later (e.g. after setting data for the first time)\n. I'm not sure I understand. Is it all ok now? :-)\n. Does this issue still exist in v2.2.5?\n. also related to #12 \n. xAxis.setValueFormatter(...) is what you should use. It's in the documentation. If you don't see that method, update the library.\n. Step size can not explicitly be set.\nBut there is a workaround:\nFirst, set the range of your YAxis by calling yAxis.setAxisMinValue(...) and so on, and then set the label count according to your needs yAxis.setLabelCount(..., true).\nAll can be found in the documentation.\n. Are you adding data dynamically? Which version of the library are you using?\n. Update to 2.1.4, and read this - especially the last paragraphs.\n. I dont really understand.\n. Disable dragging / panning the chart.\n. lineDataSet.setDrawCubic(boolean enabled)\n. Good point, I just pushed the feature. It will be in the next release.\n. setFillAlpha(255)\n. chart.setDrawBorders(false)\n. You are talking about the grid-background\n-  setDrawGridBackground(boolean enabled): If enabled, the background rectangle behind the chart drawing-area will be drawn.\n- setGridBackgroundColor(int color): Sets the color the grid-background should be drawn with.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Thats because the description has text Align.RIGHT. So you need to calculate the width of the text too and divide that number by 2 and add that to your calculations to actually get the correct center position.\nAn alternative would be to use the chart.getPaint(...) method and set the text align to center.\n. Don't add null values to your x-values array.\n. Is the code somehow obfuscated? I cannot do anything with that error message.\nWhich version of the lib are you using?\n. update to 2.1.4\n. chart.getLegend().setTextColor(...)\n. If it's just the color you want to change, then yes, it's possible: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Colors\nIt's not very comfortable tough I admit that :-)\n. Yes, you can\nif you have 3 entries, you want the middle one red and the others green, set colors array [green red green]\n. Combine scatter and line data in a combinedchart.\n. This is more a general Android question than one concerning this library.\nHave a look at stackoverflow questions addressing the issue of handling touches in nested views and check out the onInterceptTouch(...) method.\n. Looks good, I did some other adjustments locally already so I unfortunately cannot merge this.\nI also implemented it for cubic-filled-paths, or did you see any issues with that?\n. Yes that would be great if you can implement it in a clean way and test it proberly! Please wait unitl I push for the next time (should be in a couple of minutes) before starting to implement this. Then you will save yourself some time merging. Thank you\n. Alright, I just pushed you can go ahead now.\n.

Yes and no.\nIt does not work like the y-axis, but the x-axis is always as large as the x-values array you set for it.\n. Read the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\nDisabling pinch-zoom does not disable zooming in general. It just disables pinch-zooming.\n. no histograms, sorry\n. What does \"it doesn't work\" mean?\nWhat happens? What does not happen? What is the issue?\n. Try calling invalidate() after setting the data. That should redraw the View.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. setViewPortOffsets(0,0,0,0)\n. No, this is not a limitation.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/MarkerView\n. I'm not sure if this is a bug. Take a look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25929820/how-to-calculate-position-on-a-circle-with-a-certain-angle/25929952#25929952\nThe if you set the rotation-angle to 0\u00b0, the chart will start animating from the furthest EAST point. If you set the rotation angle to 270\u00b0, the chart will start animating from the top (NORTH).\n. Are you using the latest version v2.2.0?\n. Okay, I just tested in the latest version with different starting angles, and it all looked fine.\nAlso see 403b40d573ea2b627f9c9d099883726b0672d011\n. Have you tried calling chart.invalidate() afterwards?\n. I just checked it out.\nThe PieChart does have an offset of 10 by default + the space that is needed for the slices that are \"selected\" and therefore bigger.\nI just fixed this issue. If you now call this:\npieDataSet.setSelectionShift(0)\nthere should be no offset at all. If you have a selection shift (distance) > 0, than this will be the minimum offset.\n. The difference is in how you create an entry:\nNormal bar:\nBarEntry(float value, int xIndex)\nStacked bar:\nBarEntry(float[] stackvalues, int xIndex)\n. Read the documentation: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-YAxisValueFormatter-interface\n. Just change the range of the YAxis: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-%28YLabels%29\n. axis.setTextColor(...)\n. Does this error always occur? Or just in very specific situations?\nI have hade some reports about this issue, but I have not been able to reproduce it so far.\nI tested various Android versions and devices.\nWhich device are you using? Could you test another device?\n. Thanks!\nYes would be awesome if you could test the nexus 4 and report back here!\nI got one myself on which this bug does not occur.\n. I'll copy your code and try to reproduce, thanks for testing\n. What about hardware acceleration?\nDo you have it enabled or disabled? Did you make any changes to hardware acceleration in your project?\n. Found the issue. It's in your setup :-)\nYour x-index for the entries starts at 1 - but it should start at zero.\nI will think of something to prevent this from happening :-)\njava\nArrayList<Entry> pieces = new ArrayList<Entry>();\n        pieces.add(new Entry(40, 0));\n. Can't you just turn around the way ou add items?\n. This is now fixed.\n. The chart actually allows to programmatically enable/disable hardware-acceleration:\nchart.setHardwareAccelerationEnabled(boolean enabled)\n. Try calling setDrawBorders(boolean enabled)\n. Add as many empty \"\" x-values entries as you need, and adjust your x-index accordingly.\n. Thanks for mentioning, I uploaded a working one now! :-)\n. Thanks for mentioning, but there actually is a check for that:\njava\nif (entry.getVals() != null) {\n    xPos = highlight.getRange().to;\n}\nThis is the same as barEntry.isStacked().\n. For the x-index: chart.getLowestVisibleXIndex() & chart.getHighestVisibleXIndex()\nFor the y-value: yAxis.mAxisMinimum & yAxis.mAxisMaximum\n. It looks like you are not drawing decimals. Use YAxisValueFormatter and set the number of decimals you want to draw.\n. Try dataSet.setHighlightEnabled(false)\n. Yes, you can.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-YAxisValueFormatter-interface\njava\nif(value == 1 || value == 0) return value;\nelse return \"\";\n. Start your Entries at index 0, not 1:\nyVals1.add(new Entry(totalVolume,0));\n. Are you sure your calculated values are correct?\nCould you try without variables and just \"6144\"\n. Okay, I did the math:\njava\n6144 + 3365 = 9509 = 100 %\n6144 / 9509 = 0.646 = ~64.6 %\n3365 / 9509 = 0.353 = ~35.3 %\nMeaning the chart is correct. Of course it makes no sense to plot total data and used data with the chart. You need to calculate the remaining data first. Then put in remaining and used and you will get your desired result. But this is like 4th grade math, I shouldn't be explaining this here.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-YAxisValueFormatter-interface\n. I just added a new method called: setHighlightPerTapEnabled(...)\nSo do the following: \n- Call chart.setHighlightPerTapEnabled(false)\n- Highlight the last value programmatically\n. post your xml and your chart setup\n. i am not sure what you mean\n. If you want to refresh 1024 times per second, this will be an issue. But since the human eye cannot capture more than ~24 frames per second, it makes no sense to refresh any more often than that.\n. This will depend on the device. If you keep the graph simple (e.g. like in the example app - \"Performance Linechart\") up to 30.000 data points can be rendered without lag (meaning > 25fps). This number will decrease when u use specific styling, such as cubic-lines, filled-lines, ...\n. Try android:rotation=\"90\" in xml.\n. Without any further information, I have no idea why.\n. I'm still not sure what is wrong.\nUPDATE: Aaaah now I see the web lines are partly missing.\n. Fix: chart.setSkipWebLineCount(0)\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Miscellaneous\nYou can save the chart to your gallery or to another specific path.\n. Such a feature is currently not available. However it should not be too hard to do this on your own by modifying the library. I'll consider the feature in the future.\n. This feature is currently not available. However it should not be too hard to implement this on your own by modifying the touch-listener of the library.\nBest regards,\nPhil\n. Whats the purpose of using a PieChart if you change the slices away from the numbers they actually represent?\n. Assign a value of like 0.0001 and remove the slice space. Then it should show.\n. When I use the example app it draws everything below 3 entries just fine. Without any code I cannot help you.\n. If your stack has only one segment, it's technically not a stack. Therefore, simply use the normal BarEntry constructor and not the one that takes a float array as parameter.\n. I'll provide a fix for this by handing over the xpos in the getXOffset() method. So you can then do this:\n``` java\n@Override\npublic int getXOffset(float xpos) {\nif(xpos == whatever) // do this\n\nelse // do that...\n\n}\n``\n. What do you mean by \"clear\"?\n. Just set the hole color to transparent for your dataset.\n. Thx, finally a real fix :-)\n. This should be fixed in the next release, thx.\n.for (int i = 1; i < 6; i++)`\nstart your loop at 0 like a normal developer :-)\n. post your xml\n. What happens if you change the NestedScrollView to a framelayout?\n. What happens if you change the NestedScrollView to a framelayout?\n. PieChartActivity is a demo class from the example project. It has nothing to do with the library itself.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Legend\nTry the legend.setCustom(...) method.\n. Have you tried calling chart.invalidate() after adding it to the layout?\n. Have you tried calling chart.invalidate() after adding it to the layout?\n. Why did you define your graph in .xml and then add it programmatically as well?\n. The grid lines can be disabled via x- and y-axis, the values can be disabled via dataset. Its all in the wiki: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki\n. Thx for creating this PR? Did you test it? Can I safely merge?\n. I think this is what you are looking for: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/MarkerView\nConcerning the lines that show up when touching values, you can enable/disable them like this: \ndataSet.setDrawHighlightIndicators(boolean enabled)\n- setDrawHighlightIndicators(boolean enabled): Enables / disables both vertical and horizontal highlight indicator lines. Call setDrawVerticalHighlightIndicator(...) and setDrawHorizontalHighlightIndicator(...) for individual configuration.\n. duplicate issue #12 \n. Have you tried reducing the cubic-intensity?\njava\n /**\n     * Sets the intensity for cubic lines (if enabled). Max = 1f = very cubic,\n     * Min = 0.05f = low cubic effect, Default: 0.2f\n     * \n     * @param intensity\n     */\n    public void setCubicIntensity(float intensity);\ne.g.:\nlineDataSet.setCubicIntensity(0.1f)\nWhich version of the library are you using?\n. And what did changing the intensity do?\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Legend\nTry the legend.setCustom(...) method.\nIt allows you to set custom colors and labels.\nSo you could add just two colors (green & red) and then add two adequate description labels.\n. - yes\n- yes\n- multiple linedatasets is possible, multiple bardatasets is not possible\n. Show me your code and a screenshot of the result please.\n. yAxis.setStartAtZero(false)\n. Ok now it should be completely fixed :-)\n. You need to resolve the colors: getResources().getColor(R.color.transparent)\n. Okay, and whats your output? Can you show a screenshot?\n. For colors like R.color.blue you need to use this: getResources().getColor(R.color.blue) - it's all in the method documentation.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Colors\n. Well I guess your line is too thin then to be displayed.\n. Which version are you using?\n. I might have a solution for your problem.\nYou are only adding entries if a certain condition if(percentage >1) is met. In general, this is fine, but it causes you to skip x-indices. And that is not good in the PieChart.\nSo I suggest you use a separate index value in your loop and only increment it inside the if condition:\n``` java\nint xIndex = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < userMoodsList.size(); i++)  {\n        MoodModel mood = userMoodsList.get(i);\n    int percentage = (int) (((double) mood.totalCount / totalUserMoodsCount) * 100);\n    if(percentage >= 1) {\n        yVals1.add(new Entry(percentage, xIndex)); // use xIndex, NOT i\n        xIndex++;\n        // other code ...\n    }\n}\n\n``\n. Check out [FillFormatter](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/FillFormatter) - you should be able to do this\n. Thank you for the PR. Did you test if your code is working?\n. That's currently not possible. However it should not be too hard to implement. Check out theChartAnimator` class if you want to do it yourself.\n. Just use a TextView and rotate it 90 degrees :-)\n. What exactly are you invalidating?\nAre you setting the label to the same data that is also displayed in the chart?\n. This code works for me:\n``` java\n@Override\npublic void onValueSelected(Entry e, int dataSetIndex, Highlight h) {\n mChart.getBarData().getDataSetByIndex(dataSetIndex).setLabel(\"test\");\n mChart.getLegendRenderer().computeLegend(mChart.getBarData());\n // or call mChart.notifyDataSetChanged(); instead\n mChart.invalidate();\n\n}\n```\nThe method computeLegend(...) is what updates the Legend and this method is only called once when the data is set for the chart so you need to manually call it.\nAn alternative is calling notifyDataSetChanged().\n. Yes, assuming you are at least using v2.0.0 or higher of this library: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\nsetDragEnabled(false)\n. #989 \n. Should be fixed now.\n. Take a look at the moveViewToX(...) and setVisibleXRangeMaximum(...) methods of the chart: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. How did disabling HW-acceleration affect performance?\nI might have to think of a different solution for this. \n. Okay, thats good. How many values are you plotting and how long did it take?\n. Okay, thats good. Thank you\n. Check this out: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nsetViewPortOffsets(...) might be what you are looking for.\nYou can also see it in action in the example project here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivityColored.java\n. I'm not sure I understand :-)\n. Sorry, currently not supported.\n. Actually you did not miss anything :-)\nIt should work just like that. \n- Which library version are you using?\n- Wich android version are you running?\n. Yes, that could be the problem. Please try the latest version!\n. What do you mean by \"drawing the chart 30 times\"? Do you have 30 chart views?\n. Can you show some code of how you setup & refresh the chart?\n. currently not possible\n. The question is - why do you need negative indices? Why not start at 0?\nAll the x-indices do is map to x-values in your Strings array. There is no need for negative ones.\n. Horizontal bars in combinedchart are not yet supported.\n. Yes, maybe I will include something like that in the future.\n. This will be fixed in new release.\n. Images are not yet supported in PieCharts.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ChartData-class\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/PieChartActivity.java\n. The BarEntry class has a method for that.\nfloat[] stackVals = barEntry.getVals();\n. Yes, indeed it is. \n. yAxis.setStartAtZero(false)\n. check out the highlight(...) methods:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Use OnChartValueSelectedListener:\njava\npublic void onValueSelected(Entry e, int dataSetIndex, Highlight h) {\n    String label = mChart.getXVals().get(e.getXIndex());\n}\n. limitLine.enableDashedLine(...)\n. leftAxis.setStartAtZero(false)\n. no chance to do anything without code\n. Is your chart empty on purpose?\nyVals1 = new ArrayList<>();\nyVals2 = new ArrayList<>();\n. I suggest that you dont make your x-values and y-values arrays member variables.\n. Your ArrayLists called yVals1, yVals2 and xVals seem to be member variables. Change them to local valriables.\n. Yes, Option 1:\njava\nHighlight h = mChart.getEntryByTouchPoint(motionEvent.getX(), motionEvent.getY());\nint xIndex = h.getXIndex();\nOption 2:\njava\nHighlight h = mChart.getHighlightByTouchPoint(motionEvent.getX(), motionEvent.getY());\nint xIndex = h.getXIndex();\n. Are you using the latest version?\nAre you using a custom Renderer (via setRenderer(...)) object that can be null?\n. Well its a weird error because the exception occurs at a stage in code where the object cannot be null without external influence.\n. Yes, it's called LimitLine.\n. Not by default, you will have to do that by yourself by modifying the library.\n. Where is the shadow?\n. Wow my monitor is so bad I really cannot see the shadow effect :-D\nHowever I just viewed it on my phone and there I can see it.\nTo your question:\nWell it is possible to add a color below the line, that is absolutely no problem. What you have in your image is some kind of gradient, which is currently not supported and would require a custom implementation.\n. \n. \n. Hello and thank you for your Pull Request.\nHowever, for the follwing reason, I will not merge it:\n- When you propose a PR to a public library project, always bear in mind that the library might be used by a large variety of different people, with different use cases. You have implemented a feature that is very useful for you and which probably perfectly fits your requirement. However, that might not be the case for everyone.\n- You added a feature to directly draw entry data when it is a Bitmap. There are (or there might be) people who use this data object for simply storing a bitmap (and retrieval at later point), but do not want to draw it. If I merge your pull request, a lot of people might get unexpected behaviour because suddenly the Bitmap they added is drawn onto their chart.\n- You provided no methods for configuration. It is not possible to disable the feature you added.\n- Your PR is incomplete (and inconsistent), because all entry objects support storing \"data\" in them, and all chart types allow drawing the MarkerView, however, you only implemented the drawing feature for line and barchart.\nBest regards,\nPhil\nPS: Don't forget that it is always a good thing to try and contribute to open source projects. If you want to contribute, please do so. Just review your contribution carefully before submitting. Also, if you want to simply show that you appreciate a project or want to give support, there is always the possibility to \"star\" a project on GitHub.\n. Yep, that's not in the documentation. Cubic-lines currently do not support multiple colors.\n. Yep, that's not in the documentation. Cubic-lines currently do not support multiple colors.\n. Should be fixed in new v3.0.0\n. chart.fitScreen()\n. You should find everything you need int the example app: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/tree/master/MPChartExample\n. Thank you!\nUnfortunately Bitcoin is not \"supported\"\n. what do you mean?\n. Just reposition the whole view via xml\n. show the code that should work but doesnt\n. have you tried calling chart.invalidate() after all this?\n. Looks like an issue related to your code setup and the way you initialize UI components in the Fragment. Without any code this will be impossible to solve.\n. Call invalidate() to refresh the chart.\n. Have you checked your ValueFormatter in case you are using one?\nDid you call data.setDrawValues(true)?\n. Ok. I will look into it.\nWhich version of the library are you using?\n. And just to be clear: You are talking about the values that are drawn to the right of each bar? They are not visible for you?\n. Can you post the full code of your chart setup?\nI just tried to reproduce the issue but for me everything is drawn fine.\n. Weird error I guess, thanks for letting me know!\n. yes thats possible!\n. No, you will have to keep your description shorter or decrease it's text size.\n. Unfortunately a feature like that is not supported.\n. no, not by default\n. not by default, you will have to modify the library to achieve that\n. Add a bitmap to each Entry via the entry.setData(...) method and implement a way to draw the bitmap in the ScatterChartRenderer\n. This is an android layout issue and not an issue related to the library. I suggest you take a look at how to properly style your layout here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html\n. Fixed: 0d1894770ce889a20a3d90108b5a72818a5d0bca\n. Sorry, that must be an error in the documentation. Custom scattershapes have caused issues in the past and are currently not available.\n. duplicate #1261 \n. I think it's a great idea. Is there any progress yet?\nI will close this for \"overview\" reasons.\n. Show some code of how you setup the chart\n. Maybe yAxis.setXOffset(...) can help you with that. You will probably have to play around a bit with the numbers to get the right distance.\nConcerning the label count, you can use yAxis.setLabelCount(3, true) to set it to a fixed size of \"3\" for example.\n. duplicate #1275 \n.

Btw, we removed this from the realm-branch already.\nThis code should only be in the PieData.\nBecause the other data objects actually dont need it.\n. Use the ValueFormatter\n. @hongsonitptit: I have just pushed some fixes regarding your issue, please try again.\n@Don2012: This method was removed since it was redundant. It is now only available for PieChart where it is needed. You can easily calculate your own sum by simply iterating over all values. That was what that method did.\n. Okay now that you posted the screenshot I see where your issue is.\n- Problem: This project now has an optional gradle dependency to realm\nSo basically if your IDE does not support gradle or you are not building your project with gradle, you will have the build errors mentioned above.\nYou have two options:\n- Build your project with gradle\n- Remove all files that produce build errors from the library (those files are only related to plotting data directly from realm.io database and will not be needed for normal use of the library)\n. chart.setDrawGridBackground(false)\nchart.setBackgroundColor(colorOfYourChoice)\n. this method is not available for piechart\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. This issue will be fixed in v3.0.0 which is out in a few weeks. It is already fixed on the remove_xindices branch.\n. looks like the chart you are trying to save has a height or width of 0 - that is not possible\n. no, not by default\n. this is not released yet\n. call notifyDataChanged() before invalidate()\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Realm.io-database-integration\n. Not by default. But it should not be hard to modify the library in a way to achieve this.\n. This is not possible by default.\n. A feature like that does not exist.\n. Fixed.\n. try yAxis.setStartAtZero(false)\n. Those classes are not released yet.\n. I'll test it, lemme check\n. titles are not supported by default. just use a textview\n. The x-axis labels and the legend (if on bottom) seem to be pretty close together after this. Or was this already and issue before? Have you noticed?\n. Just use the formatter like it's supposed to be used: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. LineChart supports only circles. If you want other symbols, use CombinedChart with line and scatter data.\n. This wiki entry is not complete yet. I did not have the time so far to do all the tests.\n. Dependency is only optional. Without dependency library project would not compile.\n. merged\n. So what you mean is that the marker does not appear between data points, but just hops from one point to the next? If there is significant space between the points, there is lag. Is that what you mean?\n. I have identified the issue. The new version 3.0.0 will contain the fix.\n. This will work in v3.0.0\n. You just need to start your position counter at size() - 1 and then decrement it instead of starting at 0 and incrementing it.\n. Your position is not < 0, therefore your position will not be set to size - 1 the first time.\nThis is programming 1-0-1 and not an issue of the library.\n. onChartTranslate(...) & onChartFling(...) might be methods of the OnChartGestureListener that you should check out. \nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Take a look at this:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/CandleStickChartActivity.java#L195-L201\n. unfortunately this is not possible by default atm\n. not at the moment, however it should not be too hard to modify the library to your specific needs\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Shouldn't you set scale to 1? Instead of 0?\nI'm not sure :-)\n. - Take a look at the setDrawBorder(...) method and the method setDrawAxisLine(..) of the Axis classes.\n- Take a look at the ValueFormatter class.\n. Is this still an issue?\nWhat did you do to resolve it?\nAs the realm dependency is only a provided dependency it should not be in the release artifacts.\n. So your chart has a height of 10.000 pixels?\nDo you think that is a good idea?\nWhy not just restrict the viewport?\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Yeah we have some problems with the offsets. Something is not quite right.\nI'm working on it.\n. Is this the head version or just the latest release?\n. d01f03105d171608aaf43a87ed63f4716bda39a6\n. Just extend LineData and make it Parcelable. Android Studio can do that for you.\n. currently the legend cannot be scrolled by default\n. currently not possible by default\n. Show your implementation of the markerview\n. Yes, everything you mentioned can be customized.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis\n.

Are you calling notifyDataChanged() on the data object?\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\n. - Concerning IBarDataSet -> update to the latest version\n- Concerning border -> thats not possible by default, you will have to modify the renderer classes to achieve that\n. of course not, it just removes\n. use a different dataset for that circle and change the size there\n. #449 \n. I'm afraid that is not that simple. \n. You are right, I forgot to include those in the new interfaces.\nI will correct that soon. In the meantime a workaround could be casting IBarDataSet to BarDataSet, that should work.\n. Not in near future, sorry.\n. Why not use the ValueFormatter?\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. This looks like there are no colors in the color array of your dataset?\nCould it (somehow) be the case that this happens in your app?\n. A lot of people are running into OOM, and that does not surprise me because especially LineChart allocates a lot of memory when drawing with bitmaps.\nHowever, and OOM does not mean that the library has a memory leak. It simply means that it tried to allocate more memory than available at that time.\nThis could just as well mean that some other part in your application is leaking memory, and the library (beacause it allocates large chunks of memory) is the first thing to crash because of that.\nI have focused on the issue for quite some time now, and I believe that the chart does everything it should not to leak memory:\njava\npublic void releaseBitmap() {\n        if (mDrawBitmap != null) {\n            mDrawBitmap.recycle();\n            mDrawBitmap = null;\n        }\n    }\nIf you have any suggestions where the leak could be in this library (if there is one), please let me know.\nCalling System.gc() manually is not good practice at all.\n. You got ignored for such a long time because I have a life and a job and a university to attend to besides this and about 5 new issues are created every day plus dozens of emails. I'm looking into this.\n. I just replaced the standart references to Bitmaps by WeakReference. Could you please try if this makes any difference?\n.

You can use the ValueFormatter to do that. It's not as easy but overall allows much more flexibility.\nI just created a default formatter specifically for stacked values.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. In order to draw the values above instead of inside the bar, use chart.setDrawValuesAboveBar(true)\n. Currently not possible\n. Just add one more x-value at the beginning or check out this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Don't know, check your gradle setup I guess.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/XAxis-%28XLabels%29\n. Well thats because of your line-thickness which is too thick. You can either reduce it or use cubic lines.\n. Sorry, I don't understand\n. Weird. I just tired it with v2.2.0 - works just fine for me, maybe it was just a temporary issue with jitpack?\n. Just tested it again with a completely new project.\nHad no issues resolving v2.2.2\n. Add the jitpack repository:\nrepositories {\n        //...\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\n}\n. simply create a float array (float[]) and set it for the BarEntry\n. This line:\njava\nyVals.add(new BarEntry(new float[] {actualSweatPoints,actualGoalSweatPoints}  , Integer.valueOf(goalSweatPointsKey)));\nis exactly how you create stacked entries. You can see another example here:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/StackedBarActivity.java\n. I suggest you only round the edges of the last bar?\nThis is not really a library issue, I suggest you take this to stackoverflow.com\n. The constructor of LineData changed from\nLineData(List<String> xVals, List<LineDataSet> sets)\nto\nLineData(List<String> xVals, List<ILineDataSet> sets)\nSo you need to create an arralist of the interface, thats all.\n``` java\nArrayList sets ...;\nLineData data = new LineData(..., sets);\n```\n. If you want to use the new version, you have to change them.\nThis was changed because I added the feature to feed data to the chart in a customizeable way instead of predefined by the datasets. This allows you to create custom datasets that handle data differently but can still be used in the charts.\nYou can still add a normal LineDataSet to  an interface list because LineDataSet implements the ILineDataSet interface.\n. Yes, you can control this space via YAxis: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-%28YLabels%29\nBy setting the minima and maxima accordingly.\nAlso chart.setExtraOffsets(...) can help.\n. Which kind of chart are you using?\nTbh. there is not much you can do. Some suggestions:\n- BarChart has best performance, so you might wanna change to it\n- If using LineChart, disable dashed lines, fillcolor, circles, cubic, ... for better performance.\nScatterChart and LineChart can be combined using the CombinedChart.\n. What do you mean by \"inverted\"?\nCan you show me a screenshot or describe that in more detail?\n. I need to see how you setup your chart and how you add data to answer that.\n. Well that's not a library issue but more a general Android issue.\nIf your grid lines are too thin in comparison to the screen resolution, this effect can occur.\n. You can achieve that by using multiple LineDataSets and one per gap.\n. You can also customize your Legend to change that.\nUse legend.setCustom(...) method.\n. It's going to be in the next release. You will have to be patient for another couple of days.\n. There is actually no problem, but your line is too thick for the chart to be rendered correctly.\n. Yes it is. But don't use the saveToGallery(...) method.\nYou need to extract the bitmap of both views and combine them. If you do some research on stackoverflow you can find out how this works.\n. Currently the color of invidual slices in the PieChart cannot be changed.\n. I am not planning on adding a title feature any time soon. You can simply do that with an overlaying textview. As for the constants, that's something I might consider.\n. This issue has nothing to do with this library (when looking at the information you provided). Maybe you are talking about the MaterialDrawer?\n. I'm not sure I understand everything, but yes you can restrict the YAxis: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/YAxis-(YLabels)\nAnd you can react on scaling / zooming the chart with the OnChartGestureListener and e.g. change restrictions in the callbacks: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Well yes, with a few \"hacks\" I'd say you can simply change the layout of the MarkerView in the refreshContent(...) method.\nTake a look at the setupLayoutResource(...) method: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartLib/src/com/github/mikephil/charting/components/MarkerView.java\n. Try removing this from the for loop:\nsetAutoScaleMinMaxEnabled(true);\n        getAxisLeft().resetAxisMaxValue();\n        getAxisLeft().resetAxisMinValue();\nAnd call\ndata.notifyDataChanged() after calling data.addDataSet(...)\n. Documentation here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\nRead the \"Keep in mind\" section.\n. Currently that is not possible by default, you will have to implement that yourself\n. Show how you add the data and setup the  chart.\n. This should be fixed in v3.0.0\n. Just add empty x-values.\n. Just use the setColors(...) method.\n. Sure you can.\nIf you have 5 slices, and you want them to be green, red, green, yellow, blue - then add green, red, green, yellow, blue to your colors array.\n. Yes, I just added that feature: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/commit/31de4f2a2905ba4f9a211095799e3fa65376778d\nBut its not in release v2.2.0, it will be in the next release which I will publish in the next couple of days.\n. Use one LineData object and one ScatterData object. Use 1 LineDataSet, use 2 ScatterDataSets.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29699230/hide-0-values-in-staked-bar-chart\n. That is something that is not possible by default. You will have to modify the library yourself to get that behaviour.\n. Version 2.2.2? or 2.2.3?\n. Quick question: What does a hole in a cross look like? :-)\n. Ok :-D\n. Offtopic: Should I merge the branch where I removet the startatzero property?\nOr do you think this is not a  good idea?\n. Well, 90Hz is a pretty fast rate, and over a time of 10 minutes this means there are 54.000 values in the chart. That amount of data obviously takes it's toll on the library and on the operating system.\nI suggest you find a way to either reduce the data rate, or to reduce the total amount of values (e.g. by deleting old ones or doing some filtering...).\n. Are you using multiple BarDataSets?\nShow a screenshot and some code how you setup the chart & data.\n. Okay, I see the issue.\nMultiple BarDataSets in a CombinedChart are unfortunately not yet supported.\nSee here: #449\n. Show the code you use to add data to the chart.\nStart your x-index at 0.\n. yValues.add(new Entry((count/100)*total,0));\nshould be:\nyValues.add(new Entry((count/100)*total,i));\n. What do you mean by \"hidden\"?\nDo you have a screenshot?\n. Individual colors for individual axis or legend entries are not supported atm.\n. Which library version?\n. You can shot the x-values on top, you cannot show the values on top of the chart.\n. Are you talking about on top of the points? You can show anything you want in the markerview, including xaxis value.\n. Are you sure the realtime feed stops because of gc?\nOr are the 10000 iterations the thread is supposed to run simply over and then the system garbage collects?\n. Okay, well I'm not sure what do do about this :-)\n. It is now possible to set a gradient: lineDataSet.setFillDrawable(...)\nWhat you mentioned with the \"interrupts\" can be achieved by using multiple datasets.\n. You forgot to call chart.invalidate() in your update method.\n. I suggest you read this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Dynamic-&-Realtime-Data\n. Well a quite simple solution could be to simple disable all legends, axis, etc... and then use the build in functions to save the graph.\n. I guess chart.setViewPortOffsets(...) is what you are looking for.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. Is there any reason you are using a \"customized\" version of BarDataSet: CustomBarDataSet\nI guess your issue lies in your own implementation of that class. Other than that, your code is correct.\n. You need to use BarEntry class for BarDataSet, not the normal Entry class.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Data\n. Yes, that is a floating point issue.\nAtm there is not much you can do about it except rounding the value.\nI am planning to switch to double values in the future.\n. 1. You did everything correct. If you want to change the order or the axis labels, you can simply add them in a different order to your array.\n2. chart.setDescription(...) allows you to change the text and also remove it (by providing \"\")\n3. You can dynamically change the length of the labels by simply exchanging the array and re-rendering the graph. Other than that, it is possible to rotate the labels.\n4. Realtime-data documentation. I am not sure what you mean by the rest.\n. Which library version are you using?\n. I am also not sure, this is something for stackoverflow.\n. Show a screenshot.\nHave you set xAxis.setTextColor(Color.RED)?\n. call notifyDataChanged() and invalidate() on the chart\n. At the moment such a feature is not planned.\n. Ok, then make them correspond. You have a custom DataSet after all.\n. Unfortunately this induces the same problem as before the fix. Also, the hole that is supposed to be transparent is actually WHITE and not transparent.\n\n. Okay, I`ll test again too :-)\n. Just tested again. On my OnePlus One, the issue is still present\n. Okay, thanks for the effort!\nI hope we can make this work, I would also perefer your solution.\n. Awesome, I just got home, will merge it tomorrow at the latest!\n. Merged it. The issue related to \"un-equal\" slice space is gone!\nHowever if I set the hole to be transparent chart.setHoleColorTransparent(true) it's still drawn in white. Any idea?\n. I see. So if I set the hole color to transparent it is actually transparent (I just tested that). But the transparent circle which slightly covers the pie-slices is also not drawn in that case.\nSo there is actually no bug in the current implementation, however I would change a few things:\n- Remove the setHoleColorTransparent(...) method. If we have to set the hole color transparent to \"activate\" this then why is it needed?\n- The transparent circle that (partly) covers the pie slices should be independent of the hole color. Meaning that it should also be drawn if the hole color is set to transparent, since there is a different color setter method for the transparent circle.\nWhat do you think?\n. Okay, have you already started working on this?\nIf not, I'll do it, just let me know.\n. xAxis.setTextSize(...) for XAxis\ndataSet.setValueTextSize(...) for data values\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki\ntake a look at formatting chapters\n. Your link does not work.\n. Are you using a BarChart or horizontal Barchart? I cannot reproduce the issue.\n. The Highlight object has the dataset index\n. What disappears? The scatter shapes? The value labels?\nWhich version are you using?\n. Can you show the code you use to setup your chart and add data?\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. chart.setDragOffsetX(float offset)\n. Okay, in that case, go for the dummy points. There is not really an official way.\n. This sets a new formatter for the YAxis.\nYou need to use the ValueFormatter interface and set it to your data object:\nbarData.setValueFormatter(...)\n. You can fix that by adding some extra offset chart.setExtraOffset(...)\n. What do you mean by \"it does not work\"?\n. @danielgindi since this is ios, any idea?\n. Which data types do your weight and id fields have?\nCould I see the Data.java file?\n. Ok, your weight needs to be a float\n. Is your \"dati\" a string? If not, thats the reason for the crash\n. Unfortunately that is not supported atm.\n. use 2 datasets\n. Worst case scenario, if you are unable to use the Realm related classes of this library because of your setup, you need to use the normal classes instead and build them up from your database. The only difference should be a couple more lines of code.\nIn that way you can transform your long values to dates before adding them to the data classes.\n. pieDataSet.setSliceSpace(...)\n. call chart.invalidate() after setting the data.\n. Yes, please post the relevant parts of your code.\nHave you checked if you actually have data in your datasets?\nYou do not need to call notifyDataSetChanged() after setting data, that's only needed for dynamic data.\nWhat you need to do is call chart.invalidate() to refresh it.\n. Text size can be set in dp (density pixels), these pixels are already dynamic and will adopt to different screen sizes and resolutions.\n. Thank you for your report. It should be fixed, please let me know if it works now.\n. Yes, this is related to the fact that the canvas drawText(...) method ignores linebreaks. I might consider adding such a feature in the future.\n. Unfortunately there is currently no way to change this by default.\nYou will have to modify the library to achieve that.\n. Thank you for your report. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce the issue. \nBut it is highly likely this was (again) fixed past 2.2.2 - version 2.2.3 will be out soon I the issue should no longer be present then.\n. can you provide a screenshot?\n. pieData.setDrawValues(false)\n. pieData.setDrawValues(false)\n. lineDataSet.setFillColor(...) or lineDataSet.setFillDrawable(...)\n. The reason is that the chart is live rendered to a drawing canvas, it does not check system settings for changed font sizes like textfields do.\n. Yes.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Yes.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Use getResources().getColor(...)\n. Not yet available, but one of the next things on my todo list.\n. Not yet available, but one of the next things on my todo list.\n. Yes, partly.\nYou cannot define a range that should be green and a range of values that should be red, but you can add a drawable background like the one shown above to your chart.\n. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35682875/mpandroidchart-removing-old-data-points-in-real-time-chart/35687475#35687475\n. This is ios, do you know what's going on @danielgindi ?\nTo mee it looks like some kind of offset issue or too high selection shift?\n. It's fine, just leave it here :-)\n. I can confirm 2 issues:\n1. If two entries (values 99 and 1) are used in the PieChart and the hole is disabled, it still appears as this (a middle sized hole):\n   \n2. If only one entry is in the PieChart, it does not appear at all (and sometimes flickers):\n   \n. Everything seems fixed except one: If I only add one entry with (ofc) 100%, it disappears when the hole is activated. If there is one entry and no hole, it draws just fine.\n. Awesome, thx for the fix!\n. Whats the exception?\n. Which android version are you running?\n. Use stacked bars.\nnew BarEntry(new float[]\u00a0{ -5, 5 }, xIndex)\nIn that way they will be on top of each other.\n. This should be fixed in v3.0.0\n. I cannot reproduce the issue with the steps described above.\nSome fixes have already been performed regarding this issue, please be aware that they might not be released yet since the current master branch is around 45 commits ahead of the last release.\n. Choose a different x-index\n. Yep, this is a known issue and already fixed.\n. The x y values are screen pixels.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. Thats because the library internally converts to density pixels at runtime.\n. That's because you set the line width too thin so that it does not always render correctly. Increase it a bit to fix this.\n. This will be fixed in next release.\n. Thats because your slices are very small.\nThere is not much to be done about that.\n. Don't provide \"null\" strings to the chart library at any point.\n. Correct.\nSimplest solution to the problem is turning of hardware acceleration. The Chart class actually provides a method for that: chart.setHardwareAccelerationEnabled(...).\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/30354461/1590502\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis\n. post your xml\n. You can simply highlight multiple values: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. Currently only on my mobile, I will review it later.\nBut if Daniel says it's beautiful, I guess it really is :-)\n. Well the error message pretty much says it all.\nYou are adding more entries than x-values.\nAlso, take a look at this: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Realm.io-database-integration#troubleshooting\n. I am not sure where the problem is.\nTake a look at this tutorial and the example code: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Realm.io-database-integration\n. legend.setPosition(...)\n. RIGHT_OF_CHART_CENTER will make it vertical\n. I suggest you carry this to stackoverflow.com\n. Yes, this is an issue related to some Android devices and some Android versions.\nUnfortunately, this issue originates from the Android OS and there is not much I can do about it.\n. Have you checked that your database actually has values for the first two bars?\n. Yes, a sample project could be helpful. Any progress?\n. dataSet.setColors(...)\n. The issue is known and already fixed. A new release will be out in a couple of days.\n. setNoDataText(...) & setNoDataTextDescription(...)\n. The code you posted above cannot be the code corresponding to your PieChart, since you are creating entries of type BarEntry which cannot be used in the PieChart.\nAre you sure you set everything up correctly?\nColor count is not a limitation.\n. So everything works now? :-)\n. You are right, the issue is related to the sliceSpace of the pie-slices. I think that as soon as the slice space exceeds the size of the slices, this issue occurs. Since the slices are very small when adding 150 values, this can easily happen.\nIf the space is set to 0f, the issue does not occur.\n@danielgindi what do you think of this?\n. Yes, add values like that:\n\"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"8\" \"\" \"10\"\n. You can get direct access to the current zoom / scale level of the chart by using the ViewPortHandler.\njava\nViewPortHandler h = chart.getViewPortHandler();\nConcerning the YAxisValueFormatter, all you need to do is hand an instance of the ViewPortHandler to your formatter (e.g. via constructor).\n``` java\nprivate ViewPortHandler handler;\npublic MyCustomFormatter(ViewPortHandler h) {\n    this.handler = h;\n}\npublic void getFormattedValue(...) {\nfloat yScale = handler.getScaleY();\n\n}\n```\n. I do not speak chinese or japanese or whatever language was used to create the referenced issue. If an issue is not worded in english, which is the official language for this repository, I will not review it.\nThe simple fact that the issue creator did not even take 10 seconds of this time to use Google translate or a similar tool to at least translate the issue title to english is the reason for me not taking that small amount of time to do so.\nFurthermore, those methods already exist in the library, but are not yet in a release.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart#questions--issues\n. @danielgindi I have been thinking about dropping the \"copy\" feature for a long time. What do you think?\nShould we keep it or just remove it from the library?\n. Yea I know :-)\nBut this bug has been there since the beginning, and happened to be unnoticed until now :-)\n. Could you evaluate what you mean by \"the code breaks\" and what difference your suggested change would make?\nThank you.\n. #1323 \n. I just tested this and cannot confirm the issue, is anyone else able to reproduce the issue with the latest code on master branch?\n. Did you test with the latest code on master branch? (not the latest release)\n. Did you test this in the example?\nWith cubic enabled and fill enabled?\n. @PaoloRotolo is this correct? If yes, I will close this.\n. xaxis.setRotationAngleDegrees(...)\n. Have a look at the chartanimator: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartLib/src/com/github/mikephil/charting/animation/ChartAnimator.java\n. The \"max\" line is not a separate line, it belongs to the grid lines of the y-axis.\nYou can only disable all grid lines.\n. #313 \n. There is currently no way to draw the x-axis labels in multiple lines.\nWhat you can do to decrease the space the labels consume is to simply provide shorter labels. A axis label of the length you are showing above is too long for a chart to be easily readable anyway.\n. The description can be removed by setting chart.setDescription(\"\"). Concerning the other stuff, take a look at this example it pretty much does what you need:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/LineChartActivityColored.java\nThe only thing that cannot be changed is the position of the value labels.\n. No idea what the problem is... and the poor formatting of your code definitely does not make things any easier.\n. chart.setMaxVisibleCount(...) lets you set the maximum amout of entries in view for which value labels should be drawn.\nAlternatively, you can write your own logic to do this.\n. Good spot\n. super does not do anything in that case, so it's okay\n. Take a look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15008630/1590502\nIn short: Bitmap has a maximum size. It is usually equal to the maximum width and height of the device screen. A potential issue here could be that your view is bigger that the device screen and therefore this method crashes.\n. Yes, XAxisValueFormatter. You can do whatever you want with it.\n. This crash relates to the VelocityTracker.obtain()method.\nI am not sure if it is an Android issue or it's related to your setup (using both onClick and library listener), but it's not a library issue.\n. Well, the realm dependency has the provided dependency scope. This means that the dependency can only be used for compilation, not in an actual application.\nIf you want to use the library with realm, you will have to add the realm dependency to your android project, otherwise it will not work. However, you can still use all other library features without adding the realm dependency to your project.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28472785/compile-provided-apk-android-dependency-scope\n. To show you what I mean I created a small test project with no code in it, and added various dependencies and then created an apk file from it.\n1. This .apk file is from a project without any dependencies (except android support lib)\n2. This .apk file is the same as the first but also has dependency to MPAndroidChart\n3. This .apk file has both MPAndroidChart and Realm dependency\n\nAs you can clearly see adding only MPAndroidChart to your build.gradle file only adds 100kb to your apk and allows you to use all features of the library, except realm related. MPAndroidChart has a method count of about 1k, which is not much considering the 65k method limit (which can also be extended).\nOnly when you add the realm.io dependency, your apk size will increase significantly. But again, this is only required if you need to use the realm specific features of MPAndroidChart.\n. Currently not supported.\n. This is what you need: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nHave a look at the methods for setting the x-range and moving the view.\n. This issue is already fixed, but it' not in the latest release.\nThere will be a new release the fix in a few days\n. Show how you setup the chart\n. Looks like you have two chart views on top of each other.\n. What do you expect to happen? What happens?\n. And what happens?\n. The method \"Moves the left side of the current viewport to the specified x-index.\" However, this can only be done of the current x-range allows the view to move any further to the right. If your axis range restricts that, nothing will move.\n. added\n. Okay, so the issue is purely related to the toolbar? That's interesting and weird at the same time :-)\n. chart.setDescription(\"\")\n. Cool, do you have a screenshot of what it looks like? :-)\n. Library version?\n. The blue line dots are correct. My wild guess is (since you did not provide any code), that you are plotting the red line against the right (invisible) axis.\nSo call redLineDataSet.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.LEFT)\n. No problem, I actually closed your previous issue by mistake.\nI will look into it!\n. Are you absolutely sure that this issue occurs with v2.2.4?\nI just tested your problem on an Android 4.2.2 device, and everything worked fine (filled normal line, and filled cubic line)\n. Well the issue itself is known, its related to API level < 18\nHowever it was actually fixed in the new release, this is why this issue makes me wonder.\nDo you have another device to test it? (which is also API level < 18)\nMaybe the issue is device related.\nHave you tried clearing your gradle cache and then downloading the library again.\nThank you for the help.\n. Okay, so this means the issue is most likely related to the Samsung mini GT-I9195?\nIf this is a problem, maybe you could check for this device in your code and disable the filled lines.\n. Unfortunately I don't have a samsung device with API < 18 at hand.\nBut I have a variety of testing devices and it works on all of them.\nIf you have a samsung device (other than the mini) with API < 18 I recommend that you test this. Then we know if it's only the mini or samsung devices with API < 18 in general\n. This could be related to the new granularity feature that allows to control the minimum interval of the y-axis.\nPlease try leftYAxis.setGranularity(0.01f) and let me know if that resolves your issue.\n. @danielgindi as the default value of 1 sometimes can lead to confusion, what do you think about auto-calculating this (just like axis min max)?\n. You mean granularityenabled = false?\nYes, we could do that. I have written a simple \"logic\" which now auto calculates the granularity. It' basically just the axis interval divided by 10. \nThis can be improved but also should be sufficient for most cases (and definitely more sufficient than just setting it to 1 per default).\nHowever I think that we still should set granularityenabled to false per default.\nWhat do you say?\n. You are right. I will remove it again :-)\nThis was stupid.\n. Yeah. :-)\nIt's tough to answer all as it is. The hardest part actually is to figure out wether the issue is real or just caused by incompetence.\n. yAxis.setSpaceTop(...)\n. Post your build.gradle file please\n. update to v2.2.4\n. pieDataSet.setSliceSpace(...)\n. Okay, how would you improve it?\nCurrently it's not alphabetically sorted, but just numbered 1,2,3...\n. Please have a look now, is this what you meant?\n. this feature no longer exists\n. Multiple line labels are not supported yet.\n. Use YAxisValueFormatter.\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public String getFormattedValue(float value, YAxis yAxis) {\n    if(value == 0) return \"0\";\n    else return \"\";\n}\n\n``\n.barDataSet.setBarSpace(...)`\n. Have you tried modifying the offsets?\nxAxis.setYOffset(...) or\nchart.setExtraBottomOffset(...)\n. Ah I just see, it's only for some of the labels. That's a known issue, should be fixed soon.\n. That's not possible by default, but should not be too hard to customize.\n. You did not provide a name for your dataset, so you have no legend label:\nBarDataSet setSweatPoints = new BarDataSet(yVals3, \" \");\n. The issue is related to the slicespace --> pieDataSet.setSliceSpace(...)\nIf the \"size\" of the slice-space exceeds the size of a pie slice, this issue occurs. I suggest you remove the slice space if you have extremely small slices.\n. This is not directly possible.\nHowever there is a hack that will allow you to get there:\nYou could use stacked bars and simply draw the bar that occupys the space that you want to leave out in the color of the background.\n. java\nif(index == specificIndex) colors.add(Color);\nelse colors.add(NormalColor);\n. Inside your for loop that adds the entries, place this code.\n. This issue is related to slice space. I evaluated how to fix it here: #1660\n. This code:\njava\n    YAxis leftAxis = mChart.getAxisLeft();\n    leftAxis.setLabelCount(6, true);\n    leftAxis.setAxisMinValue(1.023f);\n    leftAxis.setAxisMaxValue(1.027f);\n    leftAxis.setGranularityEnabled(true);\n    leftAxis.setGranularity(0.001f);\nLeads to the following result for me:\n\nDo you expect something different?\n. Sure you can set granularity if you allow y-zoom. That's the whole purpose of the feature.\n. The granularity allows you to define the point at which the labels are no longer re-calculated. As an example, if you defined your axis to have zero decimal digits, you want to set your granularity to 1, which means the minimum allowed interval on the axis is 1, and no labels are duplicated.\n. This is a duplicate of #1637\nAnd already fixed.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. I guess those two wiki entries will help you:\n- Dynamic and realtime data\n- Modifying the viewport\n. That is weird, I cannot reproduce the issue.\nCan you show me the full class where you setup the chart?\n. @danielgindi since you wrote the code for the cubic lines, any idea? :-)\nI guess the \"cut-off\" could also be related to the padding in your layout.\n. You can just call chart.highlightValue(...) at startup and the provided entry will be highlighted.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. #1674 \n. The answer is quite simple: Plotting 240 values per second is not gonna work (or at least not for very long), even on a high end device. The library is not feasible for that amount of data plotted at realtime.\nYou can improve performance by removing any unnecessary styling from your chart and reducing the number of values plotted per second. \n. Exactly, so setting this to e.g. \"4\" takes your data size into account.\n. Which values do you mean?\n. Well the only thing you can do is decrease the range of your chart, which will put the values further apart.\nOther than that, you can decrease the text size.\n. This feature can just be found in the latest commits on the master branch, it is not in a release version (v2.2.4) yet!\nNext release will be out soon!\n. Thanks, I'll test it tomorrow!\nHave you observed any differences when calling gc() and not calling it?\n. It has not been removed. But you are working with the interface that does not expose setters.\nCast your ILineDataSet to LineDataSet and you will have access to all setter methods.\n. Without any more information, I have no idea.\n. Looks quite cool tbh. Does that kind of chart have a name?\nI guess it shouldn't take too long to make this, I'll keep it in mind.\n. Not really unfortunately. However, the new v3.0.0 which will be out in a few weeks will allow to treat the x-axis like y-axis, and then you can ensure to draw all values you need.\n. This is because the current master branch is ahead of the latest release. A new release will be out soon.\n. This can be done easily with the ValueFormatter\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/MultiLineChartActivity.java\n. This issue is already fixed in the latest commits. A new release will be out soon.\n. Grouped barcharts are not yet supported in a combinedchart. This feature will be available when v3.0.0 is out in a few weeks.\n. Yes, that is no longer available.\nI am not quite sure, I guess below v2.0.0\n. Duplicate of \n1665\n1660\n. Yep, we are currently in the process of migrating to double!\n. Update to the latest version.\nThis issue is already fixed.\n. It's possible since the chart is a View just like any other View. You should take this to stackoverflow.\n. You just need to create 3 LineDataSet\n. MarkerView can be used with the PieChart just like with any other chart.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/MarkerView\n. Yes, x-axis values currently dont support multiple lines.\n. yAxis.setDrawAxisLine(false)\n. I think you are using an older version of the library. Could you post the code snippet where this issue occurs in the library?\nFor me, the code looks like this, which would prevent nullpointer:\njava\n            float deltaX = mXAxis != null \n                ? mXAxis.mAxisRange\n                : ((mData == null ? 0.f : mData.getXValCount()) - 1.f);\n. Awesome, I will close it then. New release will be out soon.\n. Unfortunately yes. I suggest to avoid decimals for numbers higher than 1.000.000 - there is a very important reason float is used within this library. The reason is that Android matrix multiplications and canvas drawing (which are both crucial for this library and frequently used) are optimized for float values. Therefore, double is not used because it would require casting to float and thereby revert all benefits of the double.\n. If you want to draw double values in your formatter, you can always provide them to the formatter directly (instead of getting them from the method parameter) and then display them. In that way you can have the chart use float values but you can display doubles.\n. Do you have weight.size() BarDataSet objects in your BarData object?\nIf not, your code is wrong.\nTry:\ndata.addEntry(entry, 0) -> INDEX OF THE DATASET TO ADD TO, NOT INDEX OF THE ENTRY\n. ``` java\n/\n     * Sets the space that is left out between the piechart-slices in dp.\n     * Default: 0 --> no space, maximum 20f\n     \n     * @param spaceDp\n     /\n    public void setSliceSpace(float spaceDp) {\n    if (spaceDp > 20)\n        spaceDp = 20f;\n    if (spaceDp < 0)\n        spaceDp = 0f;\n\n    mSliceSpace = Utils.convertDpToPixel(spaceDp);\n}\n\n``\n. The next release of the library v3.0.0 will fix this.\n. This will be possible in v3.0.0 usingAxisValueFormatter`.\nThe new branch already contains an example: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/remove_xindices/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/BarChartActivity.java\nThe formatter in the example scales from days to month / year: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/remove_xindices/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/custom/DayAxisValueFormatter.java\n. This is not in a release yet.\n. Actually, there is:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartLib/src/com/github/mikephil/charting/data/LineDataSet.java#L365-371\nYou are probably working with the interface ILineDataSet which doesn't expose setters.\n. You are working on the interface ILineDataSet. This interface does not expose setter methods.\nAccess the setter like this:\n``` java\nILineDataSet set = ...;\n((LineDataSet) set).setYVals(...)\n``\n. Dynamic data needs a call tochartData.notifyDataSetChanged(). Yes, this feature is available since v2.2.5 - have a look at the example: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/PiePolylineChartActivity.java\n. It never exposed the setters. JustLineDataSetdoes.\nBut you can safely cast yourILineDataSettoLineDataSet` and then access the setter.\n. #1699\n. Theoretically, you could \"fake\" that effect by adding dummy data objects to the chart.\nOther than that, there is no option.\n. There is not much you can do. Just make the values smaller, or don't display them. Also, you can try setting a low chart.setMaxVisibleCount(...)\n. There are currently some issues with the new realm version. I am working on resolving them to allow using the realm implementation provided by this library again.\n. Cou can achieve that by simply making the chart view smaller or mor proportional in terms of width and height.\n. Will be fixed in v3.0.0\n. Have you tried highlight.getDataSetIndex() - it basically represents the group index.\n. This is under investigation, thanks for the detailed report.\n. Should be fixed in the new release.\n. Not yet, v3.0.0 will support that. It's gonna be out soon.\n. #1699 \n1737\n. Not yet. But I guess it should not be too hard to do if you subclass the chart.\n. Temporary workaround is setting a negative bottom margin:\n``` java\n        Display display = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay();\n        int height = display.getHeight();  // deprecated\n    int offset = (int)(height * 0.65); /* percent to move */\n\n    RelativeLayout.LayoutParams rlParams =\n            (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams)mChart.getLayoutParams();\n    rlParams.setMargins(0, 0, 0, -offset);\n    mChart.setLayoutParams(rlParams);\n\n```\n. Thank's, I think you should carry this to stackoverflow and let people who have trouble implementing realtime data know about it.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/XAxis\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\n. That is something you will have to implement yourself. It's not supported by default.\n. Thats not possible by default atm.\n. Currently not possible\n. @duanemalcolm that's the solution!\n. Thanks for the report, this will be fixed in the next release.\n. I have investigated this. In my latest code this should no longer occur, since bardata is no longer dependant on x-axis labels.\n. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce the issue. For me everything works fine. Could you post your whole setup (all the code from the activity or fragment)?\n. Alright thanks, I'll investigate this.\n. I still cannot reproduce the issue even with small values like 0,031 - 0,050\nFor me everything displays correctly.\nCould you show me the code of your fragment?\n. Take a look at the example project.\n. Without any more code I cannot tell you why.\n. leftAxis.spaceTop = 30\n. yAxis.setSpaceBottom(50f) - for example\n. OnChartGestureListener might be of help here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\n. I am quite sure this has something to do with your custom implementation of the renderer: \nchart.setRenderer(new ColoredLineChartRenderer(chart, chart.getAnimator(), chart.getViewPortHandler()));\nI suggest you check your code and see if there is anything wrong.\n. No, but you can give it a value of > 0 and format the value to 0.\n. yAxis.setAxisMinValue(0f)\n. This will be fixed in the next release.\n. Create a new class and let it extend MarkerView.\n. entries.add(new BarEntry(40f, 0));\n    entries.add(new BarEntry(25f, 0));\n    entries.add(new BarEntry(18.5f, 0));\nchange to\nentries.add(new BarEntry(40f, 0));\n    entries.add(new BarEntry(25f, 1));\n    entries.add(new BarEntry(18.5f, 2));\n. pieChart.setUsePercentValues(true) will turn anything into percent.\nBut you cannot get both values from the formatter.\nIf you have access to your data object, you can calculate the percentages yourself by using the data.getYValueSum() method.\n. I am aware of the issue, the new release v3.0.0 will contain a fix and allow to use the latest realm version.\n. All realm related features have now been moved to a separate repository: MPAndroidChart-Realm.\nThis library is based on the latest version of realm.\n. yAxis.setDrawLimitLinesBehindData(true)\n. Please use the built in feature for hiding and showing datasets, it's much easier:\ndataSet.setVisible(false) - for hiding\n. Now I get it :-)\nJust set the y-axis minimum value to zero. This was set to default 0 in previous versions and is now dependant on the values.\nSo yAxis.setAxisMinValue(0f) should fix your problem.\n. I have \n. Well you can have one marker that is movable. If you want multiple, you will have to modify the library to your needs. It should not be too hard, but it's not something that is supported by default.\n. The code related to drawing the marker can be found here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartLib/src/com/github/mikephil/charting/charts/Chart.java#L674-727\nWhat currently happens is that the chart loops over all objects that are set for highlighting and draws the same markerview at that position. This is probably where you need to start.\n. Unfortunately that's currently not possible.\n. What does \"does not work\" mean?\nWhat happens?\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-YAxisValueFormatter-interface\n. Use a DecimalFormat with 3 decimals.\n. You used the wrong x-index for your entries. You need to use the following entries:\nnew Entry(2.5f, 1)\nnew Entry(3.5f, 3)\nnew Entry(4.0f, 4)\n. Not yet possible, but good input, I will add this feature in the new release.\n. possible now 82d5fde6f2e8fc7ef1f90257de3671bac6d2d544\nrelease v3.0.0 will contain the new feature\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-YAxisValueFormatter-interface\n. I'm not sure I fully understand. This looks like a very basic thing to do.\nCould you further evaluate?\n. So what you want is a feature to drag your finger across the chart and highlight the value underneath, instead of \"clicking\" the chart?\n. Okay, that should already be possible, which issues are you experiencing? Did you set chart.setHighlightPerDragEnabled(true)?\n. All you have to do is create a highlight object that corresponds to the position you touched, and then set it for the chart:\nchart.highlightValue(...)\nYou can easily create that object yourself or use this method:\nchart.getHighlightByTouchPoint(x, y) where x and y are screen pixels.\n. You will have to modify the library to achieve that. You can start by looking at the XAxisRenderer class.\n. There are two possible issues:\n- your axis does not start at 0, which would cause the \"lower\" part of all bars to be cut off, in that case, set yAxis.setAxisMinValue(0f)\n- your formatter is cofigured to display only integer values and hence, a number like 1.9 is drawn with a height representing 1.9 but shown as \"1\"\n. Sorry, links no longer work. Can you post the code here?\n. The DefaultFormatter is for library internal use only. If you want to format your values with 1 decimal digit, please write your own class and let it implement the ValueFormatter interface.\nI might change this in the future, but for now this should be a sufficient solution.\n. @TR4Android has the solution.\n. Not at the moment, but you can simply give values that you want to be displayed on top a higher x-index than others? Or is there any problem with that?\n. The reason why your chart is not displayed is because it's extremely small (only 20dp according to your xml). Even more space is covered by the side offsets of the chart, that is why you cannot see it.\nYou should either increase the size of the chart or remove it's offsets via calling chart.setViewPortOffsets(0,0,0,0).\n. It has been closed because the issue is known and has been reported more than 10 times already. Please search issues before opening new ones.\n. Just use the eclipse gradle plugin or the .jar file\n. Yes, that is on a new branch, a lot of code from YAxis has been moved to AxisBase.\n. Probably a couple of more weeks. I plan to release at 10k stars. There will probably be a beta release before that.\n. mChart.setHoleColor(Color.TRANSPARENT);\n. Currently not possible, maybe a feature I will consider for future updates.\n. It does not work when lines are crossed. In all other cases it will work.

Can you please test again and see if the issue also occurs if \"filled\" is disabled?\nThe restart of the app is an indicator for a crash.\n. Alright, this looks very much like a memory issue, most likely related to canvas.clipPath(...) method which is used for filling. If you disable hardware acceleration, the crash will stop.\n.

The YAxis will always draw evenly unless you specify a label count and a custom axis range that do not allow even numbers.\nIf you set the range to be 0-100 and a label count of 4, even numbers are not possible since this would result in labels 0; 0.33; 0.66; 1\n.

Okay, in that case simply add an empty (\"\") x-value at the beginning and end of your x-values array.

I am not sure what you mean. Could you post a screenshot of what you want?\n. Currently that's not possible, so the best approach would indeed be to calculate the value and add them as x-value.\n. Thanks man, looks great!\nSorry that I forgot to mention this, but could you by any chance create this PR for the \"remove_xindices\" branch? This is the new branch for v3.0 and it's ~150 commits ahead of master.\nIt's code basis is very different from what is currently available on master so it would be a huge help if you could create the performance improvements for the new version 3.0 of the library. \n. I'm not sure how much boost traditional for loops bring vs. foreach. But reducing the allocations will definitely boost performance.\n. I did some performance testing regarding loop iterations. Below you can see my test class and the results. Please tell me if there is something wrong with the test, but I do not see any significant benefit of a traditional for loop vs. the \"optimized\" for loop. However, there seems to be a benefit when using traditional for loops over foreach loops.\nWhat has to be mentioned here though is the fact that neither of the loops do extensive work inside the iteration, so loop optimization in a \"real\" use case will lead to much lower performance increase.\n``` java\npublic class LoopPerformanceTest {\npublic static final int TEN_MILLION = 10000000;\npublic static final int ONE_MILLION = 1000000;\n\npublic static final int RUNS = 100;\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < TEN_MILLION; i++) {\n        list.add(1);\n    }\n\n    long time1Sum = 0;\n    long time2Sum = 0;\n    long time3Sum = 0;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < RUNS; i++) {\n        time1Sum += traditionalLoop(list);\n        time2Sum += traditionalLoopOptimized(list);\n        time3Sum += foreachLoop(list);\n    }\n\n    System.out.println(\"Traditional loop: \" + time1Sum / ONE_MILLION);\n    System.out.println(\"Traditional loop optimized: \" + time2Sum / ONE_MILLION);\n    System.out.println(\"Foreach loop: \" + time3Sum / ONE_MILLION);\n}\n\npublic static long traditionalLoop(List<Integer> list) {\n\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    long sum = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {\n        sum += list.get(i);\n    }\n\n    return System.nanoTime() - start;\n}\n\npublic static long traditionalLoopOptimized(List<Integer> list) {\n\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    long sum = 0;\n    int size = list.size();\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        sum += list.get(i);\n    }\n\n    return System.nanoTime() - start;\n}\n\npublic static long foreachLoop(List<Integer> list) {\n\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    long sum = 0;\n\n    for (int i : list) {\n        sum += i;\n    }\n\n    return System.nanoTime() - start;\n}\n\n}\n```\nResults:\njava\nTraditional loop: 806\nTraditional loop optimized: 803\nForeach loop: 1019\n. Awesome, thx!\nDid you test the caching thoroughly? v3.0.0 will probably be good to go next week!\n. Thanks, thats awesome! Did you any testing on how these changes effect performance?\nShould give some boost there as well I would guess.\n. Decrease the text size and / or increase the chart size.\nUse ValueFormatter to prevent too small values from being drawn.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\nif(value < smallestValueToDraw) {\n   return \"\";\n}\n. I suggest you check the data the is fed to the chart. It looks like the chart is drawing correctly, but the data you are providing for the chart is corrupted. Have you checked (debugged) the actual values you provided for the chart?\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\njava\n@Override\npublic void onValueSelected(Entry e, int dataSetIndex, Highlight h) {\n    myTextView.setText(\"\" + e.getVal());\n}\n. Without any further information, I have no idea, I can only guess.\nHave you set the listener?\nchart.setOnChartValueSelectedListener(this)\n. gantt charts are not supported\n. Because I spent about as much time as you did on resolving the issue.\n- https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart#questions--issues\n- Is your build.gradle file setup correctly?\n- Did you reference the jitpack repository?\n- Did you search for your issue on google / stackoverflow?\nI just tested resolving v2.2.5 on a demo project, it worked just fine. Without any further information I have absolutely no idea why it's not working for you.\n. Not really, I have nothing to do with the Xamarin port so I can't really say anything.\n. I have moved the realm related code to a separate repository due to their recent changes related to the realm dependency inclusion (now via gradle plugin). So you have to include that module in order to build:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart-Realm\nI have some work left to do on the remove_xindices branch and on the new realm repository which will take a couple of more days (maybe a week). As soon as this is finished I will publish a v3.0.0 pre release. Maybe it is best to wait for the performance updates until that release is out, and then make a PR there. I will then include the PR into the final v3.0.0 release. \n. Just set the fill-alpha value to maximum (255) than the overlapping will not be noticed. Also make sure the order of your data is correct.\nlineDataSet.setFillAlpha(255)\n. Currently not possible.\n. Nope, not yet!\n. #1919 \nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart#questions--issues\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/How-not-to-contribute\n. If you dont want the markerview to show, then don't set a markerview for your chart.\n. dataSet.setDrawValues(false)\n. That's intended behaviour as the value of the limit line should not influence the calculation of minimum and maximum value of the data.\nIf you want to prevent the limitline from being cut off, set a custom axis range.\n. This is too broad of a question and has nothing specifically to do with the library. I suggest you take this to stackoverflow.\n. That's because the radius of the chart is determined by the size of the chart-view. So of you want to change the radius, change the size of the view.\n. What you can do is add the library as a dependency module.\nv3.0.0 which will be released soon will probably also have a .jar file that you can then use.\n. As soon as v3.0.0 is out, which will probably be within the next 2-3 weeks.\n. Visibility has nothing to do with highlighting.\nCall dataSet.setHighlightEnabled(false) to prevent it.\n.

You will have to modify the library to achieve this. This is not possible by default.\n. I just tested it, for me everything works fine. Are you sure your data is not null when you set it?\n. Upgrade to the latest version and call data.notifyDataSetChanged() after adding something.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-YAxisValueFormatter-interface\n. You are using an older version of this library, and you are not adding enough x-values to display all entries you added.\ndata.addXValue(...)\n.

That's related to the newly introduced \"highlight-distance\". It's not a bug, it's a feature :-)\nYou can now specify a maximum distance to which highlighting will trigger in dp.

This can be done with MarkerView. But in that case you need every bar to be highlighted.\n. Gradients are currently not supported for bars. You will have to modify the library to achieve this.\n. This is because the way the chart treats the x-axis has changed in v3.0. Now, the developer has full control over what is displayed. All you need to do here is set a different range for the x-axis, or a different bar width.\nxAxis.setAxisMaximum(...)\nxAxis.setAxisMinimum(...)\nbarData.setBarWidth(...)\nExample:\nIf your x-axis range is 10 and you place one bar at x-position 8 (bar center), and the bar has a width of 4, it will display on the right side of the chart, with the right bar edge aligning with the right \"end\" of the drawing area. The left side of the bar will be at x-psition 6.\n. I guess the best way to do this would be to check the value upon entry creation, and then add the desired color.\n.

Are you using the FillFormatter interface?\n. Weird issue. You setup looks correct. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce the issue, for me everything works fine.

That is correct, can also be found here as part of the documentation.\n. already fixed\n. The setting data wiki has now been updated to fit the v3.0.0 release.\n. Sure that is possible, but not with this library per default. I suggest you search for a suitable line intersection algorithm and then use the data you provide for the chart in that algorithm.\n. There was a bug, it is fixed now and will be in the next stable release.\n. This is already fixed https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/commit/9ccf58feab2c1e52dfa25beff4878763d12b38b9\n. Related to #1969, stable release containing the fix will be out soon.\n. In the new release that will be out soon, this problem will no longer be present when extending the MarkerView class. In addition to that, marker positions can be adjusted by overriding the getOffsetForDrawingAtPos(...) method of the IMarker interface.\nIMarker documentation.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface\n. This error occurs because you have not added your chart to a layout, and therefore it has no size (which it needs).\n. The answer of @KIC is correct. Entries need to be added to a DataSet sorted by their x-position. Otherwise unexpected behaviour might occur. The reason therefore is mainly performance.\nI am aware this is not clearly stated in the documentation and will do some updating in that matter.\n. Documentation is now updated.\n. Setting a custom height should not be necessary.\nI assume that there is a problem with the layout the fragment is contained in, a pretty straight forward layout issue. Could you post that?\n. chart.setMaxHighlightDistance(...) allows you to control the maximum distance that will trigger a highlight.\n. Show some code.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Interaction-with-the-Chart\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Highlighting\n. The way I see it is that you are confusing \"maxVisibleCount\" with \"visibleXRange\".\n- maxVisibleCount: Controls the number of labels that are drawn until drawing of labels (only) stops. \n- visibleXRange: Controls the maximum number of visible entries on the chart area. Zooming out further than the visibleXRange is not possible.\nHave a look at the modifying the viewport documentation chapter.\n. Issue fixed as of 1bbf4be1eed520a1da075d2e5a5d4cfb686ff4bd\nThanks for the report.\n. So what you need is the corresponding \"chart values\" for screen pixels, am I right?\nYou can get them by using this method:\njava\nMPPointD values = chart.getValuesByTouchPoint(touchX, touchY, AxisDependency.LEFT);\nThe AxisDependency specifies which axis scale should be chosen to transform the screen pixels.\n. Currently not possible!\n. Yes, exactly!\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/CombinedChartActivity.java\n.

Have you tested your typeface on other UI components (e.g. TextView) and checked if it draws successfully there?\nUnfortunately I cannot reproduce the issue, for me custom typefaces work fine.\n. Okay, thanks for letting me know. If you could just tell me the name of the font, I might be able to get it myself.\n. What is the problem? Do you want the chart to start at zero?\nyAxis.setAxisMinValue(0f) for positive chart\nyAxis.setAxisMaxValue(0f) for negative chart\n. I am currently working on this, unfortunately I am unable to reproduce the issue (however I see in your app that it sometimes appears).\nCould you provide me with an exact dataset that produces the issue? (meaning all entries)\nI tried with the setup from the screenshot above, but no issue occurs. As long as I am unable to get the issue to occur on my testing device, it's hard to find the cause :-)\n. Of course I am open to all kinds of improvements. What is important to me is that the change adds value to the library useful for a great amount of users. I cannot really incorporate changes that only effect a very small target group. \nOther than that, it is also important that proposed pull requests conform with the existing coding and documentation style of the library (and platform) and are in proper form.\nNevertheless I cannot promise to merge any requests before I have reviewed them, but considering what I just said definitely makes it quite likely :-)\n. What is the result? No chart at all? A chart displaying the no data message?\nYou need to be more specific otherwise no-one can help you.\n. You are parsing a String with data into float values. That is very bad practice to say the least.\nBut this is not stackoverflow so I will not further comment on that.\nAlso, to me it looks like your parsing is faulty since you always call string.substring(...) in steps of 8 characters, but your data sometimes contains negative values with a \"-\" character in front of them causing your parser to fail.\nSummed up I am quite certain that the issue of \"the chart is not showing\" is related to your data and the way you process it.\n. axis.setDrawLimitLinesBehindData(false)\n. Due to recent changes in v3.0.0, this method is no longer available (and needed). The XAxis values are now treated similar to YAxis values.\nSpacing between axis labels can be controlled via the setLabelCount(...) method of the axis or via custom formatters.\n. Could you show the data you provided to the chart which resulted in the line being cut off?\n. I don't understand, what do you mean by \"hiding the line\"?\n. You need to add a formatter to draw the % sign. \nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. Thats currently not possible by default.\nYou can have a look at the PieChartRenderer and modify the rendering of the chart there. Simply clone the repository for that.\n. This can be done with the granularity feature of the axis.\nWhat this means is that you can control at which point the recalculation of the axis values should stop. If your minimum interval on the x-axis is e.g. 1, then call xAxis.setGranularity(1f), which will prevent the x-axis to recalculate any further.\nHave a look at this formatter which is used in this example.\n. Depending on what you want to achieve, I would see both solutions suggested by @Zhelyazko as proper.\nLineDataSet objects in itself always represent continuous lines (the library is built this way) which means that discontinuous lines can only be represented by at least two LineDataSet objects.\n. Show some code.\n. The way I see it is that you are confusing \"maxVisibleCount\" with \"visibleXRange\".\n- maxVisibleCount: Controls the number of labels that are drawn until drawing of labels (only) stops. \n- visibleXRange: Controls the maximum number of visible entries on the chart area. Zooming out further than the visibleXRange is not possible.\nHave a look at the modifying the viewport documentation chapter.\n. You can access the position via the YAxis.mEntries property.\n. Since v3, the space between bars is determined by their x-position and the bar-width.\nIf you have a bar each interval of 1f on the x-axis, and a bar width of 0.9f, there will be 0.1f space between bars.\nbarData.setBarWidth(...) allows you to control the bar-width, default is 1.\n. Here you can find an example of how to set data for BarChart.\n. does this still occur in v3?\n. Yep, the changes are huge :-D, let me know when you have tested it, thanks.\n. Okay, that's sort of a workaround. This still should not happen even with custom fonts, thanks for the report!\n. You cannot \"set\" the x-axis to seconds. That would not make any sense.\nYou yourself decide how the x-axis looks like by the data you provide and the way you place it in the chart and the way the data is formatted.\nAn x-axis range from 0 to 100 can represent seconds, but it can also represent years, depending on the data you provide and the way you set it.\nIf you have 100 data values representing seconds and you set their x-position to 0, 1, 2, 3, ... then your x-axis is \"in seconds\". If you have 100 data values representing years and you set their x-position to 0, 1, 2, 3, ... then your x-axis is \"in years\".\n. Alright. There is currently no way to show very short lines, you will have to modify the library to achieve this.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis#styling--modifying-the-axis\naxis.setTextColor(...)\n. You have only disabled the axis labels of your right axis. This still causes the grid lines of the right axis to be drawn, which represent a different scale than the left axis.\nThe solution is to disable the entire right axis:\naxisRight.setEnabled(false)\n. The getX() method is @Deprecated for PieEntry. It will always return 0 (afaik).\nUse pieDataSet.getEntryIndex(entry) to get the position of an entry.\n. This is because you are not using the latest version of the library.\n. I suggest you check the data you feed to the chart and see if it is correct. Especially mStartDate and mEndDate.\n. Sorry man, I just don't understand.\n. chart.getLegend().setTextColor(...)\n. The crash occurred in the code that you yourself wrote. The only one who can prevent this crash from happening is you yourself. \nWhen using the formatters of course you need to be aware that the value coming from the formatter might not fit any array or list you use in the formatter.\nOfftopic: As a personal recommendation I suggest to never simply place code into a try-catch block for preventing crashes. But this is more of a stackoverflow topic.\n. lineDataSet.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.LEFT)\nbarDataSet.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.RIGHT)\nThen scale your left and right axis the way you want.\n. Are you talking about IValueFormatter and IAxisValueFormatter?\nThose are not in a release yet, this is why they are not available via jitpack. A new release will be out soon and then you can get them via jitpack.\n. What do you mean by \"grid\"?\n. pieChart.setHoleRadius(...) might be what you are looking for.\n. Thank's man, I wasn't aware tbh :-)\nI only knew about Periscope for Android.\nI will definitely add those.\n. This is caused by a \"sliceSpace\" larger than an actual slice in the PieChart. Which version of the library are you using?\nThis should be fixed in the next release.\n. Altering the label position is currently not possible. You will have to modify the library to achieve that.\n. Thats because you are always using the same date object:\njava\n@Override\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n    return longToStringForTimeReal(mDateList.get(mSize));\n}\nAccording to the code you provided, the field mSize is initially set and never changes. Please review your code and read the contribution guidelines before opening issues.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Data\nThe constructor for BarData has changed in v3.0.0\n. You can increase the range of your axis by calling axis.setAxisMaximum(120f).\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/How-not-to-contribute\n. It's all in the documentation.\n. Yes, that is possible. You can have your bars plot to the left axis of the chart, and your lines to the right axis.\nAll you need to do is set the AxisDependency for your DataSet.\ne.g.:\n``` java\nbarDataSet.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.LEFT);\nlineDataSet.setAxisDependency(AxisDependency.RIGHT);\n```\nYou can then format your axes as you wish. Detailed information about the YAxis can be found here.\n. Why don't you just look at the error messages and let your compiler propose a constructor?\nAs the messages clearly indicate, the constructors of e.g. BarEntry have changed.\nFor example:\njava\npublic BarEntry(float value, int xIndex)\nchanged to:\njava\npublic BarEntry(float x, float y)\nThis can also be seen in the example project, the documentation and in the source code itself.\n. Yes, the x-values are no longer associated with the data object, instead the x-axis is treated like the y-axis, and now allows custom formatting of all values.\nYou can find an example about that in the documentation, and an example of how to format axis values.\n. What happens?\nCan you provide a screenshot?\n. Did you test this with different kind of data?\nIf yes, thank you, I will gladly merge.\n. Currently not supported.\n. Thats because your entries are not ordered: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Data#the-order-of-entries\nYou need to sort your entries ascending by x-position. The reason therefore is that the library uses binary search algorithms for better performance that only work on sorted lists.\n. @MirkoAgrati Could you post the data you used to produce the error shown above + your chart setup?\n. Thanks for the data, I could finally reproduce the issue. Working on a fix now!\n. You can control the bar width by calling barData.setBarWidth(...). Concerning the space between bars, that can be controlled by the position on the x-axis you place your bars.\n. These are features not yet in a release.\nIn release v3.0.0-beta1, description can be changed via the Chart instance.\nchart.setDescription(\"...\")\nchart.setDescriptionTextSize(...)\n. Workaround is to create a second dataset for the cirles!\n. yAxis.enableDashedLine(...)\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface\n. Unfortunately this is not supported by default - you will have to modify the library to achieve this.\n. Working on a jar.\n. Unfortunately this is not supported by default - you will have to modify the library to achieve this.\n. #2385\n. Looks like there are integers rounded in the axis. If you use decimals or set axis granularity to 1f, this should disappear.\n. Thank you for this very detailed issue description and reproduction guide. If only every issue would be as well formulated as this one.\n. Unfortunately this is not supported by default - you will have to modify the library to achieve this.\n. Currently there is no plan for a migration guide, since this would be very time consuming. The most breaking changes are mentioned here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases\nOther than that, I suggest you rely on the examples and ofc source code of the new version to help your migration.\n. You can avoid this by setting the x-axis range from -0.5 to maximum-x-value + 0.5.\nSo if your bubbles range from x = 0 to x = 10, call:\nxAxis.setAxisMinimum(0.5f)\nxAxis.setAxisMaximum(10.5f)\n. Your horizontal chart content extends from 0 - 3. The center of your bars is set to 0 - 2, this is why the chart looks the way it does. You can change that by either calling chart.setFitBars(true) to automatically adjust the size of the chart area to the content, or manually set the range of the x-axis from -0.5 to +2.5\nxAxis.setAxisMinimum(...)\nxAxis.setAxisMaximum(...)\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface\n. I'm not exactly sure I fully understand what you want to achieve, but have you looked into the chart.serViewPortOffsets(...) method? This method allows you to manually set the space between the actual chart content and the borders of the chart view.\n. This example shows how to get a fill color between lines by using the chart background as the color and filling the space above and below with white:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample/FilledLineActivity.java\n. You can just dynamically insert new colors as well. That way your newly inserted circles will have the newly inserted color.\n. dataSet.setColor(...)\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface\n. Yes!\n. You are using date long's on the x-axis, meaning that your x-axis range is most likely > 1.000.000, yet you set the width of the bars to be 0.9f \nMy point: Your bar width is so small causing bars to be invisible\n. @timusus I saw your recent contributions (issue wise) regarding this library and wanted to ask if you are interested in becoming a collaborator? :-). Make sure your axis is not set to start at zero. Can't that result in 0?\nif someone sets the skipWebLineCount to 0 - then the loop that skips weblines has += 0\n. Looks good now!\nThanks!\n. ",
    "Mrkhagol": "Thanks for the response and good other major updates so far. I have another question for you though\n..I am doing two charts where I select a category and it changes the chart based on array of data. I am looking at log and y draw values to see if it's caching the right value. It is doing that but the chart view doesn't refresh. What I have found is if I select the same category again it refreshes the view and proper y bar axis values and chart view shows up. \nIs there a way to do force refresh of chart?\n. That's something...I had that in my method all along. It just wasn't at right place where it should be called from. Now it changes chart view just fine. Thank you.\nBy the way, is there manual type read besides readme.md file so that way you don't get bothered for things like this.\n. Is there a way to set multi line chart lines to set at different widths?\nIs there also a way to over ride that it just plots from less than 2 data points. So chart draws anyway if it's just one point in array list.\nThank you.\n. I'll let you know.\nThanks\n. It seems like this technique may end up working after all but what I am doing is bit complicated on my end so it may take awhile. But I also noticed that there might be issue with applying colors. Unless the user decides to apply same array of colors again and again, this would be issue if different color sets are needed. \nSo keep that in mind to as you develop technique for adding more datasets.\nThanks again for your help. :)\n. sorry to bother you again..but is there a divider type style for multiple datasets in bar chart?

    "TR4Android": "+1\n. I can confirm this issue. It seems to happen when there are fewer entries than x-values. (e.g. 500 x-values but only 25 entries)\n. Related issue in ios-charts: https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts/issues/130\n. @PhilJay Thanks for all the work you've put into this awesome library. If you decide to only allow sorted arrays for performance reasons, could you then make your Entry class implement Comparable? This would allow sorting the array to work out of the box.\n. For anyone also experiencing this issue you can fix it by doing the following:\nAdd a new class called EntryComparator:\njava\npublic class EntryComparator implements Comparator<Entry> {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Entry entry1, Entry entry2) {\n        return entry1.getXIndex() - entry2.getXIndex();\n    }\n}\nUse this class to sort the array containing the entries before passing it to the DataSet: Collections.sort(mEntries, new EntryComparator());\nThis solved the issue for my ScatterChart. Thanks again @PhilJay for this library and also to everyone else who has contributed. It saved me a lot of work. :smiley: \n. Let me chime in here:\nWhat @gjpc has (as far as I understand it) is this: thinking of the chart as a map with locations denoted by the x and y values (int xIndex and float value) the beast takes a path on that map, say a circle. So the unsorted array that @gjpc stores has three pieces of information:\n1. The longitude of a position of the beast (the xIndex stored in the Entry)\n2. The latitude of a position of the beast (the value stored in the Entry)\n3. The time/order in which the positions where collected (the index of the specific Entry in the ArrayList containing them)\nSorting the ArrayList will naturally cause the third information to be dropped, as the index of an Entry no longer correlates with the order in which data was collected.\n@gjpc So what you can do is use the setData() method of an Entry or the corresponding constructor and store the order there (although that's admittedly a bit tedious)\n. @danielgindi Hmm, I think @gjpc didn't really complain about the visual appearance. That naturally stays the same whether the array is sorted or not. But I think @gjpc still cares about that information for other purposes besides visual appearance.\n@gjpc Wouldn't copying the array and sorting the copied array solve your issue? (Although it requires two instances the performance of the charts would still be improved)\n. @gjpc I have no experience on iOS whatsoever and thus cannot help you. On Android copying an array shouldn't remove the visual information as far as I know though, but that could be different in iOS.\nPerformance might not be the issue for the average developer, but there are some users who have a really large dataset and they wouldn't be too happy, so it should be optional.\n. @meddd OnResume() only gets called when the fragment has been paused and is resumed again. This is why it works when changing the orientation: this pauses the fragment and resumes it again in the new orientation. It does not get called automatically when new data is received.\nThe Android Developers page has a section on Communication of Fragments. Please refer to this to correctly update your fragment.\n. @Shahroz16 To address your two issues:\n- You can change the labels on the XAxis by changing the ArrayList<String> xVals passed to the ...Data() constructor. To get the exact same result as your image you could try using the setLabelsToSkip(int count) method outlined in the XAxis wiki. As images are not supported by the XAxis directly your best shot is to work around that by using unicode characters for example (\u2600 &#x2600; and \u263e &#9790;), although I have never tried it myself. You might also need to set a custom Typeface that supports those characters.\n- To achieve the dotted vertical line you can use a LimitLine. More on that subject can be found in the The Axis wiki in the Limit Lines section.\n. @goshki You can use a custom ValueFormatter to change the String displayed above the entry. Depending on what exactly you want to achieve you can either just format the value or provide another String. Unfortunately it doesn't provide the entry index though, so if you need that it'll get complex.\n. @goshki Ok, then you could try this (you'll have to clone or fork the project):\n1. Clone or fork this project and include that instead of the Jitpack version\n2. Search for getFormattedValue (see Github search results): you can then change the occurrences in ValueFormatters to accept Entry instead of float value and the occurrences in Renderers to pass the Entry. (Only in MPChartLib folder)\n3. Then you can write your custom formatter that has access to the complete Entry\nNormally I would consider doing it myself and opening a pull request, but I'm short in time. Passing the Entry definitely allows for more flexible formatting.\n. @PhilJay Thank you! :smiley:\n. In 3.0.0 you set the mode to your LineDataSet instead (you can also use HORIZONTAL_BEZIER):\njava\nlineDataSet.setMode(LineDataSet.Mode.CUBIC_BEZIER);\n. @richeekdey Have you tried calling invalidate( ) on your chart? This forces the chart to redraw its contents.\n. @richeekdey If this solved your issue, closing it would be helpful so @PhilJay can concentrate on the unresolved issues. Thanks!\n. @wtwt91 Did you try the granularity property? Something like mChart.getAxisLeft().setGranularity(0.1f). Or if you want to use three decimal places use 0.001f. Check the docs for more info. You'll also have to enable this using mChart.getAxisLeft().setGranularityEnabled(true).\n. @wtwt91 Sure, no problem :wink: \nIf this issue has been resolved and you want to do @PhilJay a favor you could close this issue. That'd be really helpful, since he already has enough work maintaining this library as it is. Thanks!\n. @talhahasanzia Maybe chart.getAxisLeft( ) and chart.getAxisRight( ) might be of help?\n. @Nfear Some code would be helpful. Do you call invalidate() on your chart after disabling the grid?. @vishal16babu @john1jan Please check out the FillFormatter interface. You can apply it to a dataset using mLineDataSet.setFillFormatter(mFillFormatter).\n. ",

Here is the modification I made : \nI declared an array of only 5 colours that will be used in the chart : \nInteger[] swimStyleColorArray =  {Color.rgb(149,209,42), Color.rgb(252, 174, 48), Color.rgb(240,146,229), Color.rgb(144,137,245), Color.YELLOW};\nThen create another colour ArrayList with one colour per bar (82 items total); \n```\n    ArrayList colors = new ArrayList();\n...\n\nfor(IBLap lap : session._laps) {\n\n        ...\n        colors.add(swimStyleColorArray[lap._swimStyle]);\n        ...\n}\n\n```\nI set the first array (with only 5 items) as legend's colours: \nlegend.setColors(Arrays.asList(swimStyleColorArray));\nSame problem\n. Hi Again, \nyes I read about that but it seems I can't call setCustom for some reason : \n\n. I have this in my build.gradle : \n    compile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v2.1.0'\nSo I guess I am using the latest one. \nAre you suggesting I downgrade ?\n. Alright, Thanks ! Any idea how long this might take ?\n. 'Did you mean you only want to remove the horizontal line but want the vertical line to be shown?'\nYes, that's it. The intersection of the highlight indicator and the line chart is marked by a vertical and a horizontal line. I need to show only the vertical line.\nAlso, if possible, replace that line by a custom drawable\n. @fountaingeyser Thanks for answering. I'll look into making some changes to the library then \n. Hi Philipp,\ndataSet.setDrawValues(false) on a pieChartDataSet just makes it so that it hides the values.\nWhat if I need it to show the values but hide what's in xValues ? (currently shows \"option A 30\" & \"option B 70\", need only \"30\" and \"70\"\nalso, would like to make the font bigger\nThank you\n. ",

Hi Gary111 and thank for this detailed explanation.\nHowever, is your method or algoritm is useable if delta of time for between time measures is not fixed, like 1 ou 5 ms, but variable like 2 ms for the first delta, then 4 ms, then 5 ms, then 3 ms, then 7, and about...\nI can't assume a fixed delta, because android system is not a determinist Operating system as you know.\n. Ok, I solve my problem with your code Gary. Thank you very much.\nNow I have une other question.\nHow to reduce the number of data displayed ont the X axe ?\nI looked at https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport\nbut I don't find the right method. I tried setVisibleXRangeMinimum(20). It's ok and show 20 values max on the X axe, but I can't lower the zoom to show in manual more values !\nI want initially show 20 values max at screen, but let the capability to the operator to show more value with a manual De-zoom.\nWhich is the right function for this ?\nThank you for your help.\n. I have found a solution to display for example the 60 first value of my data series.\nHere is the right code for this:\nlong xvalCount=series.getXValCount();\n    if(xvalCount>60) {\n        PointF center=this.getCenterOfView();\n        float scaleX=(float)xvalCount/60.f;\n        zoom(scaleX, 1f,center.x,center.y);\n    }\n. Now I want to memorize the minX and maxX displayed, in order to redisplay the same viewport when I rotate my phone and my screen .\nIs someone an idea ?\n. OK thank you Philjay. Effectively, I muddle up with langage C++.\nSo The series can contain a lot of values :)\n. ",

    "plusCubed": "@PhilJay I think, as a first step, the graph should respect the x-indices put into Entry. It could do this by automatically splitting the graph into [highest x-index] number of increments, then plotting the sparse array of x-indices. \nThat would allow for relative x-value positioning without instantiating large arrays, which I think is adequate for the majority of use cases here. The drawback is the labels are still attached to the x-indices, as opposed to an actual xy Cartesian graph, but this solution would still be much better than what is available currently.\nEDIT: I believe I was mistaken in how the x-indices of Entry work, which actually behaves as I described. I suppose the remaining issue would be the x labels, which should optimally also work with indices to minimize memory impact.\n. ",

Although Android is fiercely against placing scroll-able views within scroll-able views, sometimes you just find yourself in a situation where there is no other way.\nYou can extend the LineChart class, override the onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) from the BarLineChartBase class, request the parent to no longer intercept touch events and consume the event.\nThe following code shows this solution in practice:\n```\npublic class CustomLineChart extends LineChart\n{\n    public CustomLineChart(Context context)\n    {   super(context);}\npublic CustomLineChart(Context context, AttributeSet attrs)\n{   super(context, attrs);}\n\npublic CustomLineChart(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle)\n{   super(context, attrs, defStyle);}\n\n\n@Override\npublic boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)\n{\n    getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true);\n    super.onTouchEvent(event);\n    return true;\n}\n\n}\n```\nHope this helps.\nEdit:\nYou can change the implementation of the override to allow interception if no data is currently in the chart:\n@Override\n    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)\n    {\n        getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(getData() != null);\n        super.onTouchEvent(event);\n        return getData() != null;\n    }\n. You can use the following calls to determine whether or not a marker view is rendered upon a specific gesture:\nmLineChart.setHighlightPerDragEnabled(true);\n        mLineChart.setHighlightPerTapEnabled(true);\nHope this helps.\n. When extending the MarkerView class, you are forced to implement two methods called getXOffset(float xpos) and getYOffset(float ypos). You can use these methods to tell the chart where to draw the marker views upon highlighting.\nTo show the marker above the value you can use:\n@Override\n    public int getYOffset(float ypos)\n    {   return getHeight() * - 1;}\nTo show the marker view below the value, I suppose you could simply change this to return the positive value of getHeight(), so that:\n@Override\n    public int getYOffset(float ypos)\n    {   return getHeight();}\nHope this helps.\nSource: MarkerView Wiki\n. Worked like a charm. I ended up ignoring the posx and posy arguments of the draw() method entirely and hardcoded these to 20 density pixels:\n```\n    @Override\n    public void draw(Canvas canvas, float posx, float posy)\n    {\n        posx = PixelUtility.convertDpToPixel(20, getContext());\n        posy = PixelUtility.convertDpToPixel(20, getContext());\n    canvas.translate(posx, posy);\n    draw(canvas);\n    canvas.translate(-posx, -posy);\n}\n\n```\nThanks for the help @spaultownsend!\n. What I do to create a kind of round robin realtime chart is to check everytime I add an entry whether or not the set has more than the desired amount of entries. A piece of sample code would be:\n```\nprivate void addEntry(float x, float y)\n{\n     //Grab a reference to the LineData and DataSet objects. Initialize them if they're null.\n     LineData data = chart.getData();\n if(data == null)\n {\n      data = new LineData();\n      this.chart.setData(data);\n }\n\n ILineDataSet set = data.getDataSetByIndex(0);\n\n if(set == null)\n {\n      set = new LineDataSet(null, \"Values\");\n      data.addDataSet(set);\n }\n\n //Add the measurement to the chart.\n set.addEntry(new Entry(x, y));\n\n //Round robin the set.\n while(set.getEntryCount() > MAXIMUM_ENTRY_COUNT)\n {\n      data.removeEntry(0, 0);\n }\n\n //Let the chart know it's data has changed.\n this.chart.notifyDataSetChanged();\n this.chart.invalidate();\n\n}\n```\nHope this helps.\n. The newest version (v3.0.0-beta1) has added suport for x indices. Change your gradle compile statement to compile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.0.0-beta1' and your Entry constructors should now support x and y coordinates.\n. Dear PhilJay, \nThanks for the swift reply. I have tried the fix you have suggested and set the maxHighlightDistance to Float.MAX_VALUE. This did indeed fix some of the performance issue, but did not fix it entirely. I have made another video displaying what I mean:\nhttps://lookback.io/watch/gdxSGi4jH2mEP6J42\nDo you have any idea what might be causing this?\n. I am fairly certain about this yes. It started to occur as soon as I implemented the newly added support for x index values (in this case amount of milliseconds since the start of the session).\n. ",
    "ghost": "+1 @PhilJay \n. If you're just wanting to customize the text of the Y-label, then use:\nmChart.getYLabels().setFormatter();\n. I think this can be resolved by creating a subclass of one of the charts, and then altering the offset-matrix property by translating and scaling it. This alters the x-labels, vertical grid-lines, and data-points.\n. Hi Phil,\nI am facing the same issue. Could you please let me know what i need to do to fix the same. I using the version 2.0.8. Is there a newer version I need to use for my build. Please advise.\n\n. Any solution or workaround found? Any update?\n. In my case, I got the information of Bar's Rect from \"getBarBounds(BarEntry e)\" method at HorizontalBarChart class.\nAnd I finally got the each Rect's information of Bar.\nIf you want to use label, I think you can use label position below each Bar position.\n. I found out the solution myself. The first one was the right path.\nIf anyone needs it someday, here is what I did.\nxvals = [10, 10] and yvals=[3,20] where every entry of yvals references to xvals[0]\nso:\nxVals.add((10));\nyvals.add(new Entry(3,0));\nyvals.add(new Entry(20,0));\nxVals.add((10)); /*This is important just for the sake of getting rid of the error that says that yvals should have a size that is equal or inferior to xvals. So xvals cannot have a size inferior to yvals. */\n. This doesn't make sense. I'm giving an example of values here, but the user's data could be within any range. The chart should find out the granularity by itself.\n. Also, why the granularity doesn't work if I set .setLabelCount(2, true) or .setShowOnlyMinMax(true)? I need to have the horizontal grid lines but only the min and max labels. The grid lines only show for intervals of 1, even when I set the granularity to 0.001f\n. Had problems with a jenkins build (Android Studio 2 was working fine) but @surfer190 solution worked for me :)\n. where do i call chart.setViewPortOffsets(0,0,0,0);??\ni called it in PieChartFrag.java after setData(), but it displays an error saying that setViewPortOffsets(0,0,0,0) in not resolved.\ndo i need to import anything for this?\n. Just for my purposes I need to display the graph xValues more than yValues. It's impossible now? So for me the actual version is v2.2.5?\nThere is another question. Is it possible to disable the automatic scrolling when the call addEntry and notifyDataSetChanged?\nThank you.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38838362/mpandroidchart-first-and-last-bars-not-rendering-correctly\ntry this.\nchart.setFitBars(true)\n. I understand. Thank you.\n. \n. Its really not working. . Hello!\nI faced the same problem using CombinedChart. \nThis occurred when highlighting value programatically.\nmChart.highlightValue();\nThe error happens in getEntryForHighlight() method of CombinedData.java\nWhen switching to simply BarChart - the problem doesn't exists.\nHope it will be helpful.. @LiveWirePro  did you find a solution ?. I had time to check the cause of the issue:\nHere is the impl of setLabelCount(int count, boolean force)\n```\npublic void setLabelCount(int count, boolean force) {\n    setLabelCount(count);\n    mForceLabels = force;\n}\n\n```\nbut setLabelCount(count) overrides that count to max 25 and min to 2.  And so force method is useless or needed to be fixed .\nThanks\n. @kushanshah11 can you please share code for given question with me.\ni want to try out but can not be able to get multilinechart for selected value at a same time for multiple dataset.\nExactly i want like this.(as shown in attached image)\nit is possible to get Legend click On particular legend Click I have enable or disable draw of live chart.\nThanks in advance...!!\n. anybody can help me?. https://jitpack.io/docs/\nIf you look at the section for Snapshots that should point you in the right direction..

In our finance app (GnuCash) charts based on user data. Let's suppose that the user has income and expense transactions. In this case a stacked bar chart works as well. But what if user has only income transactions? In this situation we have broken legend and crashes on selecting.\n\nYes, I can check it in my code, but I suppose it should be handled by the charting library.\nIMHO, if a chart has yVals array, its stacked. No matter what the array size is - one or ten, it is a stacked chart, not simple bar.\n. Thanks for quick response, but doesn't work.\n. Yes, it's very strange.

    "mikereman": "This library is way to awesome to not have it on maven\n+99999.. for maven\n. Unfortunately I had no time to investigate this issue but I found a really quick and simple workaround to have \"transparent\" background for the chart.\nLet's say you have a screen with the background color #F6F3F1(which is 246 243 241 in RGB). In order to have a \"transparent\" background you may set the same color to the chart as well(it won't be transparent but it'll have the same color).\nBut if you'll set the same background color to the chart, you'll notice a small difference between the chart's and the screen's drawn background colors(this is because of the way the chart is drawn) when you run the app.\nThis is where the tricky part comes in:\n- Run your app using an emulator(Genymotion is a really good choice for personal use)\n- Open your chart screen and using a color reader application(for Mac users there is the DigitalColor Meter app in the Applications' Utilities folder | Windows users, you may use this tool: http://www.cosmin.com/colordetector/)\n- Using the ColorDetector tool, read the actual color code of your chart's background. It should be different than 246 243 241(#F6F3F1) and most probably you'll get a value like 247 243 247(at least this is what I got)\nNow you have two different colors but you need a proper background color for your chart. What you'll do is to mirror the values of 247 243 247 according to the original values of the screen's or the chart's root layout's background(246 243 241)\nLet's say we'll call:\n- your needed color X\n- your actual background color Y\n- the background color you red with the ColorDetector tool Z\n  SO your needed background color for the chart(X) will be calculated as follows for the RGB's all 3 values:\n  Y + (Y - Z) = X\nMore straightforward:\nThe RED value:      246 + (246 - 247) = 245\nThe GREEN value: 243 + (243 - 243) = 243\nThe BLUE value:     241 + (241 - 247) = 235\nSo now you have the RGB values for your needed background color for the chart(245 243 235) which is #F5F3EB.\nThis is a temporary solution I came up with really quick. Other suggestions or ideas are more than welcome.\nHopefully this workaround will help others as well\nCheers,\nMike\n. Awesome!!!\nCan't wait to try it out!!\n. Mostly for others who don't know how to fix this:\nAs a temporary fix I did the following to disable rotation and still have touch enabled:\nPieChart.java:\nI added the following method:\npublic void setRotationEnabled(boolean disableRotation) {\n    ((PieChartTouchListener) mListener).setRotationEnabled(disableRotation);\n}\nPieChartTouchListener.java:\nAdded the following attribute:\nprivate boolean mIsRotationEnabled = true;\nThe following method:\n    public void setRotationEnabled(boolean allowRotation) {\n        this.mIsRotationEnabled = allowRotation;\n    }\nAnd to the overriden onTouch(..) method's ACTION_MOVE case, the following line to the very beginning:\n                if (!mIsRotationEnabled) return false;\nSo whenever you want to disable the rotation on the PieChart you just have to call\n      pieChart.setRotationEnabled(false);\nwherever you initialize your PieChart view in your project and you're good to go(rotation is still enabled by default!!  If you'd like to change this, you just have to remove the attribute initialization on the PieChartTouchListener).\nHopefully this quick fix can help others as well!\nCheers,\nMike\n. Looks like we submitted the comment at the same time :). But related to your question: Yes.\n. Place your button and the pieChart in a RelativeLayout. Mark the button as centerInParent=true. (Place the pieChart below your button)\nHide the center text of the pieChart by \npieChart.setDrawCenterText(false);\nDoes this help?\n. It depends on how large your pieChart needs to be, but you should not worry to much about that. You can easily build your XML layout in such a way that the button is always visible(dp units do that for you).\nAlso, you can change the radius of the chart's center hole as well with something like:\npieChart.setHoleRadius(60f); // Change the 60f value to whatever fits your needs.\n. This is an already known issue (Issue 53). Please check the currently opened issues before creating a new one and try not to spam Phil's inbox with duplicate issues. For further info read the comments on the mentioned issue:\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/53 \n. No worries. I'm just trying to raise awareness of the fact that Phil is building a really awesome library which is more than useful(and this is not an easy task) so let us try and help him too even with these minor stuff like checking existing issues before creating a new one. \nIt's an open source community, we're helping each other which is absolutely normal, but let's do it better day by day!\nHappy coding Nick!! :)\n. Seems like you're not using the latest version of the library. setHoleColor(int color) is already supported in the latest update of the library.\nUse pieChart.setHoleColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.your_color));\n. +1 on this\n.

Ok I've just managed to isolate the problem and it seems to be connected to the new Toolbar i've introduced in my move to the new material theme.\nI have the following structure in the statistics activity layout xml:\nLinearlayout\n       Toolbar\n       DrawerLayout\n           Framelayout (holds the fragment)\n           \"Navigationdrawer\"\nWhen the Toolbar is commented out (and the ActionBar is just set via placeholder new Toolbar(this)) it works fine.\nThe Toolbar XML:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n   <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar\n       android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n       xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n       android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n       android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n       android:minHeight=\"?attr/actionBarSize\"\n       app:theme=\"@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar\"\n       app:popupTheme=\"@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light\"\n       android:background=\"@color/action_bar_background\"\n       xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"/>\n. Finally found the problem!\nIt was actually pretty trivial to fix: The Root-LinearLayout didn't have its orientation set. I guess it therefore resulted in a default horizontal orientation pushing everything else off screen which caused the exception in onSizeChanged\n. ",

    "robertschmid": "LOL! I was about to try switching to MPAndroidChart but due to your last response I just put this task on hold in anticipation you getting it on maven central.\n. I have considered branching this and doing the gradle-to-maven work a couple of times but I keep getting stopped by the fact that you need to create the account at maven central.  If you were to create the account and document the URL in the build.gradle file I suspect any number of people might finish the task for you.\n. Yes, that would be ideal.\nhttp://central.sonatype.org/pages/producers.html --> https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=21&pid=10134\nhttp://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html\n. I need this as well.\n. I started work on a version of this today.  I'm not sure I will be allowed to give back to the project here, though but we maybe we can exchange ideas about making it happen?  My intent is to take the column chart, extend it and simply swap the x&y axes.  I've had to make some changes to BarChart of course to make some private methods protected.\n. @asamoylenko asamoylenko - I finally got to working on this today and had a quick win.  Look at BarChart.prepareBar - left and right can be set to 0 & y and then top & bottom can take on the values that left and right used to be.  Then extend Transformer.prepareMatrixValuePx(Chart),  swap the use of deltaX and deltaY and turn off the translate.  That will get the bars where you want them to be.  Of course there are grid and axis issues but this takes care of drawing the bars while leveraging the existing bar chart.\n. @PhilJay I'm really impressed with this.  I've been working on this for about four hours now and I've got 80% of what I need done\n. @asamoylenko and others, check out my branch for a functional starting point.  (https://github.com/robertschmid/MPAndroidChart / #253 ).\nThis version has the bars oriented in the right direction, the x-axis drawing on the y-axis and the values appearing to the right of the bars.  There are other elements to do (gridlines, values axis, et al) and I welcome others to contribute to this piece.  The key is to understand the Transformer object (ColumnToBarTransformer.java) in this case and how the Matrix is used.  Then it's primarily an exercise in knowing when to swap x & y.\nAs a suggestion, if you accept this pull request it would be better if the existing BarChart was renamed ColumnChart and this HorizontalBarChart was renamed BarChart.\n. @anwar25 @abdelrahmanbadawy @layerlre  I have added an example as requested.  It is as closely modeled to the simple BarChart example as possible to demonstrate that they are essentially the same thing except that the HorizontalBarChart is rotated and has not implemented all features yet.   (for example the BarShadow has not been adapted yet.)\n. Awesome! I hope deploying to maven central is next! :)\nRobert Schmid\n(This message may be appear curt due to my using my iPhone to send it.

I do not want to use System.gc() or increase the app's heap.\nOther answers in the issues suggest simply adding chart = null.\nOther answers on StackOverflow suggesting \"unbinding\" all of the views:\nprivate void unbindDrawables(View view)\n{\n        if (view.getBackground() != null)\n        {\n                view.getBackground().setCallback(null);\n        }\n        if (view instanceof ViewGroup && !(view instanceof AdapterView))\n        {\n                for (int i = 0; i < ((ViewGroup) view).getChildCount(); i++)\n                {\n                        unbindDrawables(((ViewGroup) view).getChildAt(i));\n                }\n                ((ViewGroup) view).removeAllViews();\n        }\n}\nSource: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14759601/proper-ondestroy-how-to-avoid-memory-leaks\n. @brcinho I am sure @PhilJay would be more than happy to accept pull request referencing this issue.\n@PhilJay Yes, I can test this build. Via jitpack? I am using a different computer at the moment and I can't submit a PR but I believe you should check for null(mDrawBitmap.get() != null every where) on the WeakReference as you are not guaranteed it will be there:\nFrom:\nif (mDrawBitmap == null\n -                || (mDrawBitmap.getWidth() != width)\n -                || (mDrawBitmap.getHeight() != height)) {\nTo:\nif (mDrawBitmap == null\n -                || (mDrawBitmap.get() != null && mDrawBitmap.getWidth() != width)\n -                || (mDrawBitmap.get() != null && mDrawBitmap.getHeight() != height)) {\n. @PhilJay I am going to try, https://jitpack.io/#PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/aa5730d19f:\ndependencies {\n            compile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:aa5730d19f'\n}\nHopefully monkey tests can run past 2 hours. I will return with my results.\n. @PhilJay I am able to get LeakCanary to crash the app from too much memory using the monkey binary running an event every single 0.100 a second: adb -d shell monkey -p package  --monitor-native-crashes --pct-trackball 0 --pct-nav 0 --pct-appswitch 0 --pct-syskeys 0 --pct-anyevent 0 -s 5566 --throttle 100 -v -v -v 999999 -f and 0.500 a second: adb -d shell monkey -p package  --monitor-native-crashes --pct-trackball 0 --pct-nav 0 --pct-appswitch 0 --pct-syskeys 0 --pct-anyevent 0 -s 5566 --throttle 500 -v -v -v 999999 -f\nWithout LeakCanary, I can get monkey to run for 2hrs+. The reason I mention leak canary is because if it is able to detect memory increases then maybe there is still a memory issue. I honestly believe that if I can get monkey to run 5hrs+ on an app with the LineChart, then we should be fine. I will continue to report back.\n. @PhilJay I just ran adb monkey and was able to reproduce the memory leak using adb -d shell monkey -p package --monitor-native-crashes --pct-trackball 0 --pct-nav 0 --pct-appswitch 0 --pct-syskeys 0 --pct-anyevent 0 -s 5566 --throttle 100 -v -v -v 999999 -f:\n```\n// CRASH: package (pid 6447)\n// Short Msg: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError\n// Long Msg:

    "cavega": "@PhilJay I see gradle files in the repository, but in one of the comments above you only suggested Eclipse instructions. Do you normally use Eclipse or Intellij/Android Studio?  In order for me to get Gradle to build my project I had to modify MPChartLib's build.gradle to use \"apply plugin: 'android-library'\" instead of \"com.android.library\".  Also, in addition to @sparrowjack comment of needed statements, I had to modify my project's root build.gradle to include the following:\nallprojects {\n    repositories { mavenCentral() }\n}\nWithout the above Gradle would give an \"unresolved dependency\" error for nineoldandroids.  It would be nice if the README outlines the required steps to successfully integrate the library. I know people have requested (in another issue thread) a *.jar file or an aar in Maven, so hopefully going forward the process is streamlined.\nOn a related note, once I did all the above steps I got Android Manifest merger issues because my project's minSdk is 8 while MPChartLib is 9.  Are there any specific APIs you are using that require minSdk 9? Or was that just a target you were shooting for? Will appreciate your feedback in order to determine if I can use the library for a particular project I'm currently working on.  Thanks for your work on this library! \n. @PhilJay Thanks for the response. Any feedback regarding as to why the minSdk been set to 9? Is there an API limitation that required you to set it to 9?\n.

I don't mind to wait for a high quality library :)\nI'm great that you're interested to implement candlestick chart for your wonderful library. I will keep a close monitoring on your \"experimental\" branch.\nThank you very much.\n. Hi Phil,\nWow. That's really fast! \nI will look at your candlestick chart immediately, once I finished my half-baked in progress feature : http://yccheok.blogspot.com/2014/08/do-you-like-new-dividend-page-design.html\nI will provide you feedback most probably before end of this week.\nThank you very much!\nCheok\n. Hi Phil, I had spent few hour to play around on candlestick feature. However, I had diverted my attention to this issues : https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/60 I tried to figure out the root cause of slowness but still haven't find any good hint...\n. Just some quick thoughts by observing the log timing.\n1. Is there any particular reason BarLineChartBase's protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) needs to be triggered total 3 times to handle touch event? Can't we just perform 1 time the following action?\n1) Figure out the touched coordinate (touchindex x:...)\n   2) onDraw being triggered. MarkerView will be drawn too in this step.\n2. Is there any reason why we want to handle our touched coordinate in onSingleTapConfirmed, but not immediately after receiving event in onTouchEvent? As it takes 300ms for end user to observe screen update after he touches the screen. This might give user perception that the charting component is slow.\nFor getClosestDataSetIndex in BarLineChartBase, I realize it perform searching by using linear fashion. If the data set is huge, this might have impact on the performance. I once encounter similar performance issues. I solve it by using binary searching.\nhttps://github.com/yccheok/jstock/blob/master/src/org/yccheok/jstock/gui/charting/ChartLayerUI.java#L660\nBut, these are just my first impression word without performing any deep studying into your code. I might be wrong...\n. Multiple onDraw occurs during demo of LineChart - http://i.imgur.com/zSaW9N8.png\nThanks. Going to test on your new fixes.\n. ",

Hi, trying to do the same thing. Do you find any solution?. @enginebai\nThanks for your solution, but I still have some problem:\ngetHighlight(x, y) is the solution when x is known\nIs there any method to highlight both min and max y values, but x is unknown at once?. @enginebai \nThanks for your help. You can see how I solved my question at #2925 .. java\nnew LineData(ILineDataSet... dataSets)\nnew LineData(List<ILineDataSet> dataSets). java\nchart.getXAxis().setValueFormatter(new Your valueFormatter);\nsee here. I find out the reason.\nI enter entries in reverse order, which is not a problem to barChart. \nHowever, while drawing lineChart, the function drawLinear(Canvas c, ILineDataSet dataSet) which is in LineChartRender.java gets the wrong mXBounds.min and mXBounds.max and leads to wrong mXBounds.range. This is the reason why I can see my combineData has lineData value, but it draws nothing after I setData().\nTherefore, the solution is entries must be entered in order.\nPS. chart.setTouchEnabled(true); also affected by this reason.. I have searched many issue, and notice that  this will crash at CombinedChart.getEntryForHighlight() because of highlight.dataIndex is -1 and causing an index out of bounds error.\nHowever, if I use simple LineChart or BarChart, this error will not occur.\n\n\n. @Dongwei0516\njava\nnew Highlight(float x, float y, int dataset)\nTherefore, the dataset of red line should be 0, and 1 for the other. #2925.

I think I found the culprit\n\nAxisBase\n```\n    public void calculate(float dataMin, float dataMax) {\n    // if custom, use value as is, else use data value\n    float min = mCustomAxisMin ? mAxisMinimum : (dataMin - mSpaceMin);\n    float max = mCustomAxisMax ? mAxisMaximum : (dataMax + mSpaceMax);\n\n    // temporary range (before calculations)\n    float range = Math.abs(max - min);\n\n    // in case all values are equal\n    if (range == 0f) {\n        max = max + 1f;\n        min = min - 1f;\n    }\n\n    this.mAxisMinimum = min;\n    this.mAxisMaximum = max;\n\n    // actual range\n    this.mAxisRange = Math.abs(max - min);\n}\n\n```\nmax = -3.4028235E38\nmin = 3.4028235E38\nthis.mAxisRange = Math.abs(max - min) = Infinity\n. Another potential fix is by changing the ViewPortHandler\n\nmTransX = Math.min(Math.max(curTransX, maxTransX - mTransOffsetX), mTransOffsetX);\n\nwhen curTransX = NaN mTransX is set to NaN so we cannot update the value even\n.

I can confirm that the animation pools were not properly created. I'm working through a massive refactor/ documentation update now and I believe I've fixed the issue already, but the commit is still a bit into the future. I noticed a few cases already where these objects were NEVER recycled, despite that being the intention of the ObjectPool class, to allow these animations to be easily reusable.\nSpecifically, I believe this line is the cause of the problem, Android Studio even reports a warning on it:\nLine 49\njava\nthis.recycleInstance(this);\nThe problem is that it uses this.recycleInstance(this) instead of what ZoomJob uses, a plain static call to recycleInstance(this)\nI can also confirm that these objects aren't super expensive, so perhaps gutting the ObjectPool and just creating these objects locally could solve the problem, as they are guaranteed to be garbage collected if only being created in local scopes and not permanently stored with activities or other objects. But I'll leave that option up for debate.. I know it's been a VERY long time but if you want, please update this to resolve the conflicts. I would do it myself but I'm trying to get this project back to a manageable state and I cannot spend too long on every pull request and issue.. @JImmyBhavsar You reset cnt to 0, and then used that as the X axis value, not x. By doing that, the next set starts back at 0. You'll need to manually map the dates to cnt, so that the date/ MetricValue pairs actually match up, or just don't reset cnt after populating the first array.\n@pawan4one, @neerajpandey1512, @the-maux, make sure you are all doing the same. The Entry uses the X value you give it, so make sure you pass the right value.. Closing for inactivity. Closing old issue. If anyone still has this question please open a new one..

Could you please create a new pull request for this, as the file structure has changed. This looks fine, except I recommend that instead of creating a brand new example activity, please find one existing activity and show it off there without changing the chart too much. Thank you!. @beautifulSoup Thanks for keeping up with the library, but sadly I already merged another pull request (#3820) that fixed this.

Sorry to ruin the party, but this issue tracker tries to maintain a primarily english language. I will try to help despite this, but in such a case where an entire discussion is going on in chinese is not very helpful for the maintainers of this library.\nI am working on an update that adds improved label positioning for bar charts. Can't remember if I pushed it yet, but it is coming in the next version. I'm closing this since the issue will be resolved soon, and I know there are other issues asking the same thing in english..

Thank you!. @noberasco the pull request by semirke already does this. Hello, @almic here, there is no need to bump this anymore :). > Tragically, floats are all MPAndroidChart knows.\nI strongly disagree that this is a problem. Floats where added because, by default, they allow for more precision than the original integer implementation and also to use the full range of numbers that a float knows (which is actually very large, including the extra decimals you get).\nAnother thing I disagree with is using Float.valueOf() to convert the string directly into a number. I don't understand how data is lost with a relatively small number for the available range. I doubt you are actually experiencing the exact string 253,235,664 being turned into 253235661 in your code, since the biggest accurate number you can attain with a float is something around:\n\n340,282,346,638,528,860,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.000000\n\nAnd that isn't even including the fact that you can use the tenths and hundredths place with no relative loss of precision.\nAnother detail, you have access to IAxisValueFormatter, use it to your advantage! Instead of storing the X index at whatever massive number you are using, store it at increments of 1. And then initialize your IAxisValueFormatter with the same data in your graph, but with the real X values, and just map them 1:1 as a label. That way you completely avoid converting the 253,235,664 into a number at all, you just use that exact same string as the label.\nInstead of complaining about the surface limitations, look at all the things MPAndroidChart can do under the hood for you, which is often the way you should be doing it.. @Jetz72 I went over-the-top in the response with rounding, and indeed java rounds 253235661 to 253235664, assuming you are confirming by testing yourself.\nHowever the underlying problem is NOT with the library. We can do nothing about float precision, and perhaps going to doubles may be a necessary step to alleviate this problem. However keep in mind, this sort of thing is well known in Java, it's not some new problem or bug that this library has yet to patch.\nBut like I've said before, the current implementation of floats is not the source of the problem. Only when others begin expecting floats to be perfect is when the problem manifests. The solution is simple, don't use such large numbers and expect absolute precision.\nI assume your data source is precise, but a chart on a UI built to simplify the data into a more understandable format does not need precision to 9 decimals.\nThis library leaves the scope of the programmer and goes into the scope of the artist. You have to make the data understandable for users, and meaningful. For a Pie chart or Bar graph, literally no one will see the difference between 253235661 and 253235664 when the entire thing is plotted, and probably not care. If you were specifically comparing the two numbers, it would become obvious. But in that case you can just pass 1 and 4 into the chart, and add 253235660 to the labels with the ValueFormatter.\nInstead of using 253235661 exactly in the value label, use 253M. It looks better and is much easier to understand the actual size than 253235661\n\nInstead of complaining about the surface limitations, look at all the things MPAndroidChart can do under the hood for you, which is often the way you should be doing it.. @Jetz72 I agree that the documentation needs work. It's no secret that this library attracts an alarming amount of low quality issues asking for things to which the answer is most often a single method call. I'm actively working to fix this with issue templates pointing to the documentation, but so far it has done nothing to stop these kinds of issues.\n\nThe library is very bulky, and often the means to an end result aren't intuitive. A common question I've answered almost every day since I started work here has been using different axis labels, and many don't realize they can pass the data directly to the formatter to get more control of the data.\nEither way, doubles could work. I'm going to keep this closed because it's still not a big deal. Users would prefer seeing 253M over 253235661 every time, at least when displayed in a chart format. Raw numbers? Obviously the full value, but you wouldn't be using this library if you wanted to show lists of raw numbers.. @Rohitsaxena I think @evelynray was returning null objects in his value formatter, which is obviously a big no-no for Strings as an empty \"\" string works fine. Please make sure you aren't doing that, and also make sure your library is the latest release version, as similar errors to this may have been patched already.. Hey there! This issue is fairly old, and may no longer apply to the current library version. I'm closing this in order to clean up the issue tracker.

Looks like dragging much be enabled for that to work, as zohabAli recommended.\nEdit: In addition to having isDragEnabled == true, the chart must also be fully zoomed out and unable to drag in either direction for highlighting to work. I'm reopening this to allow drag highlighting when the drag direction is not panning the graph, because that should allow highlighting.. Thanks @shubham1g5 . @ankita1427 This stack trace actually has nothing to do with the original problem in this issue. The original problem is caused by the renderer trying to draw values with no data. That is your own problem in the value formatter SevenDays.java that you created, not the library. Please read the first line of your stack trace, and STOP posting stack traces on issues! It's actually super annoying, create a gist and link your traces from now on.. @ymmmvp36 sorry but this issue tracker is not the place to ask for programming help. Questions like this belong on stackoverflow.. same as 2238, closing. Despite the alarming amount of other pull requests all trying to solve this:\n3603\n3878\n3763\nI feel this may be the best solution so far. However, rather than trying to juggle two different bitmaps in memory, just remove the WeakReference entirely. The performance impact is certainly minimal and not worth the NullPointerException gymnastics you're currently doing.\nRemove the WeakReference stuff completely, and let android handle garbage, we don't have to ask twice for it to do garbage collection.. I guess in Java it's more efficient to help the garbage collector instead of becoming the garbage collector, which is what I was suggesting. Merging.. Closing old issue.

Currently I see no need to do this in the library itself, due to how simple of a feature it is. If you want axis titles, there is no reason you can't manually put two text views on the sides of the chart view. This is like asking android to add the ability to add a feature that adds captions to ImageViews. They would never add that because you can already do it with TextViews.\nThis is no different. Won't fix :/. I'll reopen this. I stand by my opinion that a TextView is better, and you can easily change the legend position by the way.\nHowever my opinion doesn't matter as much as the users, as this library is built on user contributions, like this one.. Without any code samples, I cannot determine if this problem is within the Library or not.\nBut I can say that this is nearly certainly a problem with your own code. There is an example activity in the project example app called PerformanceLineChart.java, which claims to nicely render and dynamically add up to 30.000 data points. Just try dragging the seekbar back an forth to see how effortlessly the chart handles it!\nIf you are trying to add, as you claim, over 200.000 data points, I would suggest thinking about who the h*** needs to see that much at once, and how important that much data really is. I would bet you could show 1/100th of the data and the general message you are trying to convey will be the same. No user would even be able to tell the difference between 2.000 and 200.000 points if you rendered them without dots, and averaged the values together. For starters, try combining every 100 entries into one single averaged entry. The phone should nicely handle that simple math and the renderer will thank you graciously by rendering 100 times faster.\nOne last thing: when working with such large amounts of data, your problem is not with the software, but with the hardware. The phone doesn't have a $200 graphics card inside it, so you have to optimize anywhere you can. Also, do all the data crunching in an AsyncTask and then load it to your chart.. sorry but this issue tracker is strictly english only. We cannot help you with this.\nClosing old issue.

Wouldn't it be simpler to check the point being selected and then update the surrounding UI with options? Rather than the graph itself?. I don't see why we can't recognize gestures when visible ranges are set or zoomed. Hopefully it won't be too hard to fix this. Adding to the support list.. Please stop adding code to this issue, it is getting a little out of hand. Make absolutely sure you are doing things in the right order, because chart.invalidate() should always be called LAST, after you notify the data has changed!. Perfect PR. @NasarIqbal I wish I could help you out, as this is a pretty simple design question, but I really can't spend the time to help you. I'm working on updating the library to simplify it so it's easier to find what you need and customize charts. For now you just need to search through the wiki and see if you can't find what you're looking for.. @poyarkov95 I don't think this hasn't been added yet.

This does sound like something that should exist in this library, and with the currently existing functions this shouldn't be too difficult to implement in a future version.\nBut I'm sad to say this isn't possible. Right now you could hack your way to a 2 slot gantt chart, but that's it. Those other issues linked by @judemanutd are a little obscure and don't actually use the term \"gantt chart.\" I've closed them to focus future discussion here, as well as changed the title to better reflect the actual question being asked.\nEDIT: Nevermind for some reason I can't change the title.... @judemanutd Currently, this is literally on the to-do list, but nothing planned as far as a timeline goes. I will probably be adding this myself, unless someone else beats me to it. To put a rough estimate on it, I would say anytime from now until next month is the current \"no-so-planned\" timeline for this.. @anitaa1990 design requests are rarely accepted, but I think this is something that should be added in some way.

Update for @pagrzybe, looks like this already existed with the methods setAxisMaximum() and setAxisMinimum(). I noticed a bug that causes graphs to gradually increase their y axis min and max range, mostly noticeable when dragging left-and-right on the seekbars to change the vertical range. This didn't exist on the horizontal range, however.\nI think that the current implementation is good, but if you would like to I encourage you to see if the current version gives you what you wanted. If not, please open another pull request and test your changes by dragging the seekbars on the example app to make sure the ranges aren't drifting.\nSorry, and thanks for your patience!. Closing old issue. If anyone still has this question please open a new one.. @jaime1990 please don't comment on old issues. If you've already scoured the documentation and can't find a solution, then please open a new issue. I will, however, recommend that you simply change the visible range by a half increment of your data. So, if you want to show data between 1 and 5, then set the range to 0.5 and 5.5, so the labels won't draw but get extra space.. Is this actually a memory leak though? The class reserves two objects, which are reused as needed. Seems intentional that the objects stay in memory, because at any moment the user could do something that triggers an animation..

HHMMM... a very nice improvement this is!\nBut I wonder what the best way to solve this is. I've already closed another PR which just split single strings into lines by \\n characters, but that doesn't offer much more customization. I'll look into this further and see if I can think up a better solution than just adding support for \\n in strings.. @xie438305665 I'm going to ignore the fact that you quoted the entire post.\nPlease open an issue if you have a problem, this post was made to show how to override the hard limit of 25 (which I agree makes little sense). Also, how is anyone supposed to help you if you just post a screenshot with no context or explanation?. This doesn't seem to be implemented yet, at least looking around the java doc hasn't offered any straight-forward solutions.. Well, the point of a Pie chart is to draw it in a circle.\nA horizontal stacked bar chart will do exactly what you are asking. You can easily disable the axis rendering, too. Check out the official documentation, it should have exactly what you are looking for. Also, there is an example activity in the example app that uses horizontal stacked bar charts, so look at that too.. Hey there!

LargeValueFormatter is a convenience class to quickly format \"large numbers in a pretty way.\" The idea is to create your own custom formatter by implementing IValueFormatter and IAxisValueFormatter.\nIf you have a value formatter that you want to add to the project, create a pull request for that.. You're looking for the file strings.xml. Do some reading about string localization at the android developer website.\nYou'll also want to look at plural strings.\nIt's a little bit of reading, but if you want to implement localized functionality, you'll need to convert the current hard-coded strings in the LargeValueFormatter here:\njava\nprivate static String[] SUFFIX = new String[]{\n        \"\", \"k\", \"m\", \"b\", \"t\"\n};\ninto string resources.\nPlease know this: I'm not sure if the strings.xml carries over into projects that declare this as a dependency, but this is definitely the way to go. I would start by adding this into your own project first, and then when you've got it working, try plugging that into your own fork of MPAndroidChart, make a release on GitHub, and see if the module handles it for you.\nBest of luck!.

If you just subtract 0.5f from each entry index it should line up nicely. Don't forget you can also set the granularity of the axis, snapping to intervals of 0.5 nicely, as well as limiting the number of visible labels.\nYeah, a bit hacky and shouldn't require this much to make the axis look fine, but it's only because the default behavior is to automagically calculate every aspect of the chart, which it seems almost everyone disables those settings. Perhaps the best solution is to change the defaults to hard-coded constants instead of automatic calculations?. Hey there!

This has been fixed. ~This bug is not caused by the XAxisRenderer. The value you changed, i to i / 2 is checking if the current drawn label is the last label, and if so, it correctly shifts it back width / 2, since the label is already centered and only half clips off.~\n~Please use xAxis.setAvoidFirstLastClipping(true). If that still doesn't fix the problem, you can simply increase the visible X range with xAxis.axisMaximum(float), just add 0.5f or similar to the last X value.~\n\\~ nothing to see here \\~. I just double-checked, and it looks like I was wrong.

Marking as a wontfix due to how small of a detail this is. If this library added every small detail requested it would bloat the library significantly with so many design options that finding the ones you want would be very difficult, and would make the useful ones hard to find underneath all the insignificant options.\nSince we cannot add all small design requests, we cannot add any small design requests. The only requests accepted are significant and obviously beneficial. This request is simply too small and insignificant to be worth adding, even if it makes the chart look fancier, it does not add any significant benefit.. Hey @eakteam! Yes, I was recently invited to this project and, as far as I know, the only one working on it.\nI plan on fixing a lot of long-standing bugs and crushing the issues to a more manageable number.

I added a downvote to balance it out :). This is a very minor design change, so small I doubt a user would actually care which circles overlapped which. Right now I do not plan on adding a new flag and render check to support something so specific, and honestly not noticeable unless you actually showed someone the two options side-by-side.\nYour best option is to add the entries in reverse order, this may be enough to trick the renderer into drawing them in the order you want. I haven't personally tested this, but from looking at the render and data set classes, it seems possible. . Since this is such a minor design flaw, I doubt any users would really care enough that their experience with your app is degraded.

But you could've done that without asking for help here like it was an online forum where people happily help you with whatever problem you have. Please don't do this on other repositories for GitHub, the maintainers will not appreciate it anymore than I do.. @63ea Well you see, that's the sad part. Once an issue is created, it can never be removed. That's why they need to be taken seriously. I advise you to never open an issue on GitHub unless it's a feature request for a project you love or a serious problem you've been having for some time, and you've exhausted all attempts to solve it.\n\nIf I sound harsh, I'm not trying to be. I'm just telling you how it is.. What kind of issue is this?. > without model class\nIf you mean \"without the example class\" called ListViewMultiChartActivity.java, then I cannot help you.\nYou should really look at the example activities. I don't understand why so many people open an issue and expect an answer when the answer is literally in the example app. A RecylcerView is very similar to a ListView, you just have to learn how to use it. I didn't know what a RecyclerView even was at one point, but then I did some research and learned everything about it.\nCome on, people! At least TRY before opening an issue!. @xyz5359502 your description is quite difficult to read\n@gfdarcy In that case, I'll answer both of those.\nsetGranularity() allows you to specify the steps that gridlines are drawn. You probably want to use a value of 1.. I'm not familiar with 9-patch, but I know it's in the drawable space.\nThe current implementation is just fine, it also uses the better known layout files. Changing this will only further complicate the code and make it harder for others who want to mimic this effect.. Just as a reminder, you are talking about the example app. I stand by my decision that this is a non-issue, and the current implementation is fine. However, this doesn't necessarily mean a pull request would be outright denied. However, this is such a small detail that it would only be noticeable with large text, as you demonstrated with the entire latin alphabet. Even then, it doesn't look that bad.\nIf you really want to, make a pull request and describe why it makes sense. From your reply, you already have a pretty strong argument in favor of 9-patch.. @AndroidDeveloperLB my argument was never against 9-patch, it was in disagreement that this should be changed at all. But like I said:\n\nIf you really want to, make a pull request and describe why it makes sense. From your reply, you already have a pretty strong argument in favor of 9-patch.. Use it as a gradle dependency, please.\n\ngradle\nimplementation 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:vX.X.X'. That sounds like a nice feature. The user clicks on a legend item and the chart could highlight that specific line, or toggle that data off. Currently the legend is pretty small on the screen, so touch listeners will be difficult to implement without making the legend significantly larger than it already is.\nWhile I would love to add this to the to-do list, I cannot because I know it can be better accomplished by implementing it yourself, without using the built-in legend feature.\nPersonally, I prefer creating my own legends. You should too, the built-in one is very limiting and only exists as a fast way to show a legend when complexity isn't required. I would recommend doing this in your own code, add a legend yourself in the layout files, and then set up buttons with custom shapes and click listeners that interact with the chart.\nWould be a really nice built-in feature, but the complexity it would bring is far out of scope for this project.. First of all, dead image link. Github lets you attach images directly, use that instead because that way you know people will be able to see the image.\nAlso, without actual code, there is no way to tell what is actually causing this problem, whatever that problem actually is (no image).\nIf you are still having this issue, please open a new issue and attach your images and some sample code (DO NOT paste the entire file, only the necessary code).. I'm not going to try to debug your code. Only you can do that.\nCheck the multiple stacked bar chart example activities in the example app. I'm sure the exact code you are looking for is in there.. Don't use a legend if you don't want it to show the data sets. Why are you trying to do this anyway?. This is asking for a logarithmic axis, something that will be added. Check out #2768 and #2801 for some existing, temporary solutions.. Why are you using NEGATIVE numbers in a PIE CHART?\nJust think about it for a second: What does a Pie Chart show?\nAnswer: The parts of a whole\nYou don't have negative values in Pie Charts, it makes no sense.. This was intentionally built-in, and if you think about it for a few seconds, it makes sense to hide the value labels when the data gets really close together.. > when user moving\nWhat? Could you please describe what you mean by highlighting \"when [the] user moving.\" I can help you when I understand what you want.. There is not enough detail here to know what could be causing this problem. Could you please open a new issue and better describe what you are doing and then I could help you.. Nice idea, I don't think this would be very hard to implement.. If you are asking to remove specific slices of the pie chart, you should be able to do that by just changing the colors to include a transparent color for the one you want to hide.\nOtherwise, this issue doesn't explain enough for me to understand exactly what you are asking. Since this issue is so old, I'm going to close it with the assumption you've already figured this out or no longer need it.\nIf you are still having this problem, please open a new issue and describe what you want in more detail.. Yes, what do you mean by that?\nIf you want to see a list of methods for the axes, go to the wiki, linked at the top of the page.. Already in the works, check the project boards here. Haven't gotten very far into the issue list, but boy this problem is in a lot of issues!. Pulled 3702, closing this one.. I know I saw something like this earlier, but I never saved the issue number I guess. I can't remember if this is actually possible in the library (the red arrows), but it definitely should be.\nI edited the question to specify that you are talking about the red arrows.. Just referencing these for the future\n222\n3509. Very odd. I'll look into this at a future date. In the meantime, could you provide some more information on what exactly you were doing that caused this, and what you were trying to accomplish?. If you know the slice value, and have set custom labels, and also know the order you added them in, then you could surely determine what text would've been set inside the slice.\nYou also mentioned this:\n\nIn the case of getValue() when the all slice value are same, it redirects to the first redirected activity.\n\nWith that comment, this issue sounds a lot more like \"How can I make this work, because I don't want to figure it out myself\" instead of \"Why isn't this working\" or \"How can I specifically do this,\" which I would gladly answer for you.\nI'm closing this because it is clearly about getting help with your project, instead of getting help with a specific aspect of MPAndroidChart. This issue board is not for debugging or general development assistance.. setAxisMinimum(). Did you figure this out?\nIf not, look at setAxisMinimum(). The library does allow for this, but the exact method signature escapes me right now. You're looking for an axis-specific method, something called setAxisMinimum()\nYou'll probably be setting the Y axis minimum to 0 to push the chart all the way down. You can do the same for the X axis, making the minimum slightly lower than the current lowest value, so as to not show the label for the next smaller value (if you need to worry about that).. This is definitely going to added in the next release, but I cannot give a timeline for it yet. A lot of the features planned are user-made, and have some outstanding requests for changes before they can be merged.. I suggest doing this from a different method. Instead of doing this in PieChart.java, do this in the renderer and make it default to 0.5f. That way the renderer is doing what it's supposed to do, render the PieChart slices.. @bksinha4497 are you kidding me? This is not merged, so obviously this is not available yet.. @sembozdemir Thank you for your contribution! Although I didn't use your exact code in favor of a more functional approach when min angles are too big, I would like to credit you for bringing this to attention and providing the base for this feature.\nAdded in aea2ff3417e30d6d4b1ce7e777cbd8bc83e1c95d. Looks great. I would suggest going all the way with your idea on the value lines ending outside the circle with a dot at the end, but this works fine the way it is. If you could add the option to draw lines with an entirely separate color list, that'd be awesome too.. This limitation is rough, however adding a way for MPAndroidChart to do this automagically for you is out of scope.\nThe simplest, and best solution, is to manually scale up those smaller values, and use a value formatter to change them back to the original values, if you are using value labels...\nHowever, a Radar chart is best suited to compare different values without necessarily seeing their actual value, which is excellently shown in the example RadarChartActivity.java in the example app.\nI would also challenge you to think about the way such a chart would look. As a user, it could be overwhelming to see 4 data sets on a single radar chart, and be useless for the core purpose of charts: to give people a simple way to simply see data at a quick glance on a simple chart. Did I mention making your charts simple?\nI could go on about good UI design, but I'll leave it for now.. Very strange. However I cannot help other than pointing you to the example project, which does this perfectly. Check out the RadarChartActivity.java, it uses custom labels and everything without issue.. WHY are you setting data with such high X-index values. You have access to the AxisLabelFormatter, use that.. Go back to the documentation and look again. You can definitely accomplish this, and its even inside an example activity for the example app.. First guess: You are not notifying the dataset or chart about the changes to your data, causing the IndexOutOfBoundsException.\nSecond guess: Your chart is not being properly resized, assuming the second chart changes the max ranges. Best solution is to first make sure that mValues is never called with a value outside it's range.\nThis initial step, not calling mValues.get() with a value you can determine will be outside it's index range, is trivial. I bet if you tried that before posting this issue, you would've realized the problem and not had to come here.. setAxisMinimum(). That stack trace looks a lot more like it happened totally outside the library. Also, you didn't paste the full stack trace. And don't even get me started on how annoying it is to see a stack trace just pasted straight into an issue. You can attach files to an issue, did you know that? Much easier to download a stack trace instead of scrolling down the issue page every time you want to see a new comment.\nBecause I cannot see a single call to any method inside of MPAndroidChart, or even inside your own code, there is no way to know what actually caused the problem.. Perhaps setCenterAxisLabels(true) is causing this?. Hey, @vidsag's solution is your best option right now. However, adding the ability to map values to colors is definitely something I want to add.. @AlekseyLitvinov solution is the way to go. Closing. What kind of issue is this? You have a huge text box to explain your problem, use it next time.. I know you can do this with Bar Charts, so I'm sure you can also do it with the Line chart.\ntry setCenterAxisLabels() on your axis objects. You have to notify both the dataset and the chart that it's data has changed, then invalidate the chart so it renders with updated data. Please check the documentation and example project. The solution is out there, please look for it before opening an issue.. This is way out of scope for this project. Cool idea, but definitely no.\nIf you want something like that, I would first recommend learning some basic algebra and do that yourself. Once you understand the math of that effect, it shouldn't be hard to track touch points inside a view and update the line function constants depending on the X and Y location of the touch.. *Facepalms*\nDid you even try before creating this issue?. That's a lot of code! Sorry, but this looks more like a debugging issue, rather than a bug issue. I'm closing this because this repository's issue board is NOT for debugging. Go annoy stackoverflow if you want debug help, I'm sure they'd be happy to help. Also I couldn't even tell what the problem was that you are having.\nHowever, here is my two cents: try using 3 different charts entirely, instead of changing one chart depending on the setting.. There is no question in your issue, despite it being obvious you are looking for an answer to something.\nI'll take a wild guess and say: yes. This is correct behavior.. > The program reads dataset's data and will reports the array subscript's transboundary.\nIs that even a sentence?\nRegardless, this \"bug\" makes no sense. The renderers use that method to determine if it should draw any values or icons. The code to draw value labels and icons are in the same function, but that function is only run when shouldDrawValues() returns true, that is, either value labels or icons have been enabled.. Something like what you describe, at least in that image, is currently possible (I believe) with two y axes.\nHowever, something as generic as that would be difficult to hard code into the library. It would require at least two new options, a flag to enable this and a threshold parameter. However that alone wouldn't work if the data was too extreme, requiring multiple levels of breaks.\nDrawing that on paper is easy, but putting something that objective in code will be a hassle and would probably just end up creating another feature that needs to be maintained yet rarely used.\nI really like the idea, but this isn't practical to do automagically. You'll have to check out the dual y axes feature which already exists and manually determine a threshold.. Like @AliGolmirzaei said, this issue should be fixed by #3820 now.\nRegardless, another possible solution is to use setAxisMinimum() on the X axis to be slightly higher than the last entry's x value, like this:\nchart.getXAxis().setAxisMaximum = 10.5f. You can use LimitLine to draw lines on the graph, if you want that. Otherwise, do what @ArilesGit said and use multiple data sets.. I guess you're talking about that \"spike\" just before it goes to 68. This is fixed by using the dataSet.setMode() to something like LineDataSet.Mode.HORIZONTAL_BEZIER or LineDataSet.Mode.LINEAR\nRight now it looks like you're in LineDataSet.Mode.CUBIC_BEZIER mode, which tries drawing a much curvier line between points.\nI'd recommend playing with the cubicIntensity with dataSet.setCubicIntensity(), if you want to keep the cubic mode.. You can use the AxisValueFormatter to write custom labels for each bar. You can construct it by passing in your map, which just get's the key for that value and converts it into a string. That is the easiest way to do this, avoiding the legend completely.\nThe legend is automatically calculated based on the data sets in the chart. See the example BarChartActivityMultiDataset.java activity in the example project. To get what you wanted, you'll have to create a new data set for each, and call data.addDataSet(set) for each new set. You'll also be able to add the labels to the legend this way.. When zooming? This may be related to the NPE when doing certain animated zooms. This issue has already been reported, so I'm closing for a duplicate.. I don't speak chinese, but hopefully you understand english.\nYou can extend AxisValueFormatter and simply add a negative sign in front of the labels.\nIs that what you wanted?. The legend colors are IDENTICAL to the data set colors in your graph. If you have changed the colors of the legend, then you should already know the colors you set them to, as well as have access to the original data sets whose colors you've also set, although changing the legend colors afterwards is a little redundant since you should've set them in the datasets before hand.\nxkcd. You are doing it wrong. getFormattedValue(value) is passing the number along the axis, which could be any integer number.\nYou have to account for when the X axis value goes negative, and when it exceeds the number 4, which in this case is the index of the last value in your String[] quarters.. Closing for inactivity.. The second graph looks fine to me! Use that one!\nI'm closing this for now, as I've done the same thing in my code...\nchart.getAxisLeft().setAxisMinimum(0f)\n...and it has worked for me, so I'm guessing this isn't a problem with the library.. Also, remove the call to setStartAtZero(false), this is deprecated and may be causing this issue!. This is a really good feature suggestion, but this is definitely out of scope for this project.\nSomething like that would require, preferably, the ability to pass some crazy function into the chart and it spit out some craziness like that. A function with two possible X axis values is an entirely new level of math for sure. Normally, you'd pass a single function twice if you wanted that on, for example, your average graphing calculator. One positive and one negative version of the same function.\nTherefore, the only solution is to draw two data sets, in which they both terminate at the furthest point. In this case it'll be the far right. This would be an algorithm you'll have to write yourself if you want to pass different x values for one line. However, it shouldn't be hard to do. You would just have to create a new data set every time the X values stack. Two sets for two X values, three for three, and so on.... If you are mathematically inclined, however, feel free to implement a polar graph. The ones whose functions look like this:\nr = \u03b8\nYour lines look a lot like what I'd see on a polar graph. chart.getViewPortHandler().getTransY() should return the current pan along the Y axis (not specific to left or right). I haven't tested the values for this but I'm sure it'll probably equal 0 if scrolled all the way down, assuming the minimum Y range is 0.\nYou'll need to play with that, and just disable scrolling on the Y axis, inside your touch listener, until ACTION_UP or ACTION_CANCEL is called, at which point you can enable scrolling again after the chart is released.. Looks like your data set becomes null at some point between creating it, and updating it. I would suggest creating a separate ValueFormatter class entirely, and passing the barChartDataSet to it and saving it there, so that it isn't lost in the background. The problem may be that the inline class called valueFormatter doesn't know about barChartDataSet or it's value.\nThe problem is definitely somewhere in this code, last I checked DataSet's don't randomly turn themselves into null.. You could also just add a TextView on top of the chart, just make sure it's xml translationZ is high, 5dp should work. You may be able to use limit lines with 0 width or a transparent color, and just set the label.. This isn't possible right now, however the solution would simply be to allow charts to have broken data points in between, probably by using NaN or allowing null x or y values to define breaking points. Another could be just animating data sets one at a time, if specified via an option.\nFor now, you'll just have to deal with strange animations. . I doubt this is currently possible with the library right now, but You could probably force something like this by drawing multiple pie charts (disable setRotationEnabled()), with different radius sizes, all on top of eachother, with transparent colors for the larger slices so they aren't drawn.\nThis sounds like a cool addition to the library, however, so I'm going to leave this issue open.. The shadow will not be possible, at least I doubt it. You could possible use the xml layout attributes that all views have, like elevation or z index. By default that will add shadowing to views underneath it, but it may not work properly on these rendered views. It could, but don't count on it.. Issue titles should be short, concise headlines. Perhaps just \"Display Legend in rows and columns\" would work fine. Also, you have a big box to write more detail, put your full question in that, not the title.\nAnyway, currently this library only support displaying legends in a vertical or horizontal alignment. Sorry to say, but for now you'll need to pick one if you want to use the built-in legends.\nHOWEVER! You are in luck!\nPersonally, I draw my own legends. I like to draw the labels in their color for the data they represent, so I just stuck a TextView on top of the chart (in the xml using android:translationZ=\"5dp\"). Drawing your own legend gives you a lot more freedom. If you want to keep the same style that MPAndroidChart uses, you can use a RelativeLayout or something similar, set it's width and height to 1 or 2dp, and make it's background color the color of the data, then snap the TextView next to it.. Check this code excerpt from the LegendEntry class:\njava\n/**\n     *\n     * @param label The legend entry text. A `null` label will start a group.\n     * @param form The form to draw for this entry.\n     * @param formSize Set to NaN to use the legend's default.\n     * @param formLineWidth Set to NaN to use the legend's default.\n     * @param formLineDashEffect Set to nil to use the legend's default.\n     * @param formColor The color for drawing the form.\n     */\n    public LegendEntry(String label,\n                       Legend.LegendForm form,\n                       float formSize,\n                       float formLineWidth,\n                       DashPathEffect formLineDashEffect,\n                       int formColor)\n    {\n        this.label = label;\n        this.form = form;\n        this.formSize = formSize;\n        this.formLineWidth = formLineWidth;\n        this.formLineDashEffect = formLineDashEffect;\n        this.formColor = formColor;\n    }\nIn the @param definitions, it says this about the String label:\n\nThe legend entry text. A null label will start a group\n\nYou may not be able to group them in a 2x2 square, but you should be able to clearly separate them vertically by using a null label in between. You could also set the form to LegendForm.LINE to draw a horizontal line (I think).\nI haven't tested this myself, but that's a good place to start. I'm closing this because, although you can't set them as a 2x2 square, it is probably best to put them on different lines as it makes it more obvious which colors go to which labels.. I don't speak chinese, but I hope Google Translate can help us both.\nI think you're problem is that the labels are overlapping. As @rainbow7 said, try using...\nchart.getXAxis().setLabelRotationAngle(45f)\nto rotate the labels. If you don't want to do that, you can easily reduce the labels drawn with\nchart.getXAxis().setLabelCount(5, false)\nto draw only 5 labels, but to also allow the renderer to draw more or less if there is space to do so.\nI'm going to close this issue for now, if you still need help then feel free to comment on this and I'll come running back \ud83d\udc4d . Could you rephrase: \"but that does not display when there is no zero data in the chart?\"\nIt confuses me \ud83d\ude16 \nIf you have no data in the chart, then the chart skips drawing any data inside. But if you have a BarChart, and try to draw 0, you shouldn't see anything anyway. This makes sense to me. Instead of trying to draw a single bar with a value of 0, I suggest not putting that data inside the chart at all, and instead use...\nchart.setNoDataText()\n...to inform the user that there was nothing to populate the chart with.. I don't see why that would cause values to not be drawn at all. Could you please double-check your value formatters and chart initializers? If you still can't figure it out, then post the code here where you create the chart and add the data.. @VcotyQin, did you figure this out?. I have a feeling this is because the library automatically hides labels in circumstances where they would start to overlap or be difficult to tell apart. This may be one of those cases. I'm still going through the full library code, if I see any red flags that could cause this I'll be sure to fix it.. @AllorNothinAbiq, if the issue is resolved, I encourage you to close this :). Interesting that something like this has been sitting here for 12 days now. This project needs more maintainers.. Guess who's back! Merging.. when doing setLabelCount(), you should also pass true as the last parameter to force that value.\nxAxis.setLabelCount(rows.size, true)\nKeep in mind that the max number of labels is 25 (hardcoded limit). You could be adding the values in the wrong order, but I'm not sure if that affects it.\nI use the LineDataSet.Mode.HORIZONTAL_BEZIER with a cubic intensity of 0.5f, and it looks fine for me.\nTry using the HORIZONTAL_BEZIER or decrease your cubic intensity setCubicIntensity(). Use a listener on the table, and inside that listener, call highlightValue(float x, int dataSetIndex) on the pieChart\nx should be mapped to the order of the entries you added, and dataSetIndex is probably 0. \"Sometimes\" doesn't help debug this, and neither does truncating the full stack trace...\nHowever, looks like you are passing min and max visibility values the wrong way. This is likely caused by passing a min X/Y visibility range that is GREATER than the max X/Y visibility range, specifically the min range - max range is coming out as -2.\nPlease make sure the min is actually smaller than the max \ud83d\udc4d . Not currently possible within the library, however nothing it stopping you from throwing a drawable on top of the border.\nThat image looks more like a SeekBar, something you can do. You could just draw your own custom SeekBar below the graph (near the x axis), and make it move the graph based on the seek bar's value.\nThere may be other libraries to draw such seek bars, too.. Create a pull request, and also describe what problem this fixes. All that does is force the image to be a square shape, which is probably intentional.. You can easily change the \"zoom\" by changing the visible range.\nchart.setVisibleXRange(min, max)\nchart.setVisibleYRange(min, max)\nYou can also animate this by doing zoomAndCenterAnimated() on the chart.. Thanks for the update, glad it worked. Could you please describe this better?. Closing for inactivity.. You can use limit lines.\nCheck out the javadoc and implement the OnChartValueSelectedListener, and just remove and re-add a limit line whenever a value is selected.. I don't understand chinese, but hopefully Google Translate will serve us both well.\nI cannot find the method setUnit() anywhere. What does it do? What chart type are you using?\nProvide some example code and I could better assist you.. Closing for inactivity.. Those aren't errors, it's just logging the data. You can turn off logging with chart.setLogEnabled(false).. Looks like the chart and the dataset don't agree on the number of entries. I would start by loading the value from getDataSet() directly into it's own variable called set, and the adding entries. Once you finish adding the entries, pack them into a new PieData called data, and then call pieChart.setData(data).\nYou may have to call notifyDataChanged() and notifyDataSetChanged() on the data and chart object respectively. If you still get this error after doing that, open a new issue with the code you are calling, and put the stack trace in a gist (press the + at the top of the website), so that the issue page isn't full of spam.. You can manually change the number of labels, which is how the gridlines are drawn. Just call xAxis.setLabelCount(count, true) to force it to draw what you want to be shown. You can also adjust the granularity of the chart so that your labels are drawn on the months or the years, by changing it from 1 to 12. Check out the javadoc, and go to the AxisBase class to see the functions you have at your disposal.\nKeep in mind, the library has a hard limit of 2-25 for the number of labels drawn.. @FrancoSabadini please DO NOT post on closed issues asking questions. This issue tracker is not for support questions. If you have questions, please go to StackOverflow and ask your questions there. You could also read the documentation and look at the example app, it probably has what you're looking for.. pieChart.setRotationAngle(angle) is what you are looking for. The default is 270f, or 3 o'clock. To start at 12 o'clock, you should just have to set this to 0f. You can set it immediately after you create the chart.. Please describe your problem in more detail, right now I can't make sense of what the issue is or where it could be. What methods are you calling? How are you setting the values? Did you make sure to setDrawValues(true)?. Closing for inactivity.. Should be accomplished by calling setDrawAxisLine(true) on the XAxis object, from chart.getXAxis()\nMake sure you give is a color, too. If you gave it a hard to see color at some point, that may also be the issue.. I'll reopen the issue since that didn't fix things, but I can't tell where the problem is based on the code you gave. Everything looks correct to me. Since you said the line draws when you change the font, I suggest doing that for now despite it not looking how you want.\nCould you post a link to a gist with the entire file (or files) responsible for configuring this chart? I may not get around to it, but it'll be better for other contributors. In the meantime, it sounds silly, but make sure you have the latest library version, and check the javadocs, you may find a solution buried in there.. The current implementation works just fine. And if you want to add this new image, you may as well make it compatible for all dpi (mdpi to xxxhdpi). And you should also make it optional, the current implementation forces it on all values, regardless of highlighting.\nBasically, make it optional and only for highlighted values. See the MyMarkerView class in the example project. You can technically already do what you are trying to do, just setting a different background in the custom_marker_view.xml.. If you want to add new data points to an existing chart, like a line graph, check out the example RealtimeLineChartActivity.java in the example project.\nYou just have to grab the chart's data object:\nLineData data = chart.getData()\nAdd an entry at the end:\ndata.addEntry(new Entry(data.getEntryCount(), y))\nAnd alert the data and chart about the new entry\n```js\n    data.notifyDataChanged();\n    chart.notifyDataSetChanged();\n// optionally move to the last entry\nchart.moveViewToX(data.getEntryCount());. Can you please further explain what the issue is? If the question is about generating random values, use `Math.random()` or head over to stackoverflow.com, this issue board if specifically for questions regarding core functionality of MPAndroidChart. . Closing for inactivity.. It does seem that new gradle versions are available, however since Android Studio is only automatically updating to 4.4, that should be fine for now. I just built this version and it worked, merging.. phaseY is set by the ObjectAnimator, I believe. You'll have to follow the breadcrumbs of `extends` and `implements` to find any extra info.. Very good idea. Yeah, this probably isn't implemented yet. I don't remember seeing anything like this.. I glanced over your code and here's my suggestion.\n\nYou should be implementing the interface into a class, not creating a new object.\nAlso, getFormattedValue() returns a String, and you get the x/y coordinate from value, so you can easily use that as an index for, say, an array of month strings.. I don't think this is currently implemented. Here's what you could  do.\nYou can reduce label numbers, and combine your data points like you've done in the 2nd screenshot. If you want less points, then pass less points into the data set.\n. I'll leave this open. I think it would be nice to automatically reduce points drawn with optional settings.. Please see the Wiki section on this GitHub project (top of the page). It has styling options described there. setGridBackgroundColor(int) is what you need.. Well since no one has commented on this I guess it's cool to add but whatever \ud83d\ude1e . Yes! Use the ValueFormatter class. Examples are in the example project, many graphs use custom formatting. They are just a simple class that takes a number and any other initializing data, and return formatted labels.. Thanks for the follow-up, glad that was the solution.\nWhile I'm at it, I suggest creating a separate class for the formatter, so you can reuse it easily. Something like this:\n```java\npublic class MyAxisValueFormatter implements IAxisValueFormatter\n{\nprivate DecimalFormat mFormat;\n\npublic MyAxisValueFormatter() {\n    mFormat = new DecimalFormat(\"###,###,###,##0.0\");\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n    return mFormat.format(value) + \" $\";\n}\n\n}\n```\nCurrently, you have to create two separate classes to format axis labels or graphed values. These may be unified in the future, though.. You could probably split the positive and negative values into two separate sets, and individually fill those with lineDataSet.setFillDrawable(fadeDrawable). However, I bet the fills with overlap and spread into each other, but you may be able to avoid that with some cleverness in the drawables.. Interesting... I'll check back in a couple hours.. Here's my best guess:\nThe default constructor always creates an empty set of colors, then immediately adds a default color. Perhaps you overwrite that list and accidentally passed null for a color. I bet the problem is in your code somewhere and not with the library.\nI'm going to close this for now, and if you can't figure it out, try again. If you still can't figure it out, take a break and come back tomorrow. If you STILL can't fix it, open a new issue with the code that causes it and a full stack trace file. Since I couldn't find any other issue about this, I'm pretty sure it's hiding somewhere in your code.. Yes, since the library has been... er... ignored... for the most part... for around a year now, the documentation in the Wikis is very limited and sometimes wrong.\nStep one will be updating the javadoc, and then step two is updating the Wiki to be more extensive.\nAs far as I know, I'm the only one left who is working on this project. This is definitely on my to-do list.. Looks like the method you want in this case is Chart.getMarker(), not Chart.getMarkerView().\nThat's probably happened because someone decided to simplify the name to just Marker in some places, but but forgot to unify the name everywhere. It should be called MarkerView everywhere, in my opinion, since the base class is also called MarkerView. May be \"undeprecated\" soon if I have anything to do about it, but I'll investigate why this decision was made.\nFor now, check out the example LineChartActivity1.java in the example project, it uses a custom marker \"view\" called MyMarkerView. It looks like you're trying to get an instance of the MarkerView, however you'll need to create one yourself, there is no default MarkerView.. Woah, that's a little out-dated. You can now call Resources.getSystem().getDisplayMetrics(), no need for any context. Utils should definitely be updated to use the system instead of a context.. ~Well first of all, you have set the visible X axis range to, effectively, zero.~\n~setVisibleXRange(minimum, maximum)~\n~By setting both the minimum and maximum to the same number, you have restricted the view to only x = 180, probably not what you meant to do.~\nFor now I would suggest rounding down your data you are trying to display.\nInstead of displaying X values from 0 to 180, with only 3 labels in between, display X values from 0 to 18, and set the granularity to 6. You can easily create an AxisValueFormatter and ValueFormatter which just multiplies the values by 10, returning you to the original data.\nBasically, instead of changing the internal code of the library to handle bigger numbers, just use smaller numbers in the data, and format them back to the larger set. This also helps you design a more user friendly interface, by forcing you to take screen space and size of the numbers into account.\nThere is a reason why the library takes float values for the x axis, specifically to give a solution to problems like this.. I updated my reply, please ignore the first part.. I take it you'll see my reply on your issue, so I'm closing this.. Currently, no. However this is definitely on the list of stuff to add. In the mean time, check out the other related issues for gradients in bar charts (quite a few exist) and there may be existing workarounds hiding in them. \ud83d\udc4d . This is more of an instance state saving problem, something you'll have to learn how to do on your own. The library cannot do this for you, it has to be done at the activity level.\nSee the android developer page Saving UI States to learn how you can accomplish this.. Just cast your integer to a float: (float) 5\nAnd then set the chart granularity with chart.setGranularity(1f)\nAlso, please read the wiki, it describes exactly how to do this. I'm sure there's also some example activities in the example project that do this.. I guess you are using the current repository, which is currently being refactored. For production, please only use the releases. If you are working on the library, please look at the com.github.mikephil.charting.animation.Easing class, it now contains the EasingFunction interface and all the easing functions.\nHowever, it could be troublesome if this error occurred in the existing library.\nWhere did you get this error?. Since you're here, could you confirm for me that MyEasingFunction.java isn't being used by any of the example activities?. Okay well it looks like when I was refactoring, I deleted that class because nothing was using it, and I found it redundant to have an \"example\" when just looking at the original Easing.java would be much more helpful.\nGuess I forgot to push that change, however. Thanks for reminding me.. This probably has to do with the view you are drawing, not the library.\nPlease, if you have a bug, use the bug report template as this issue is not helpful at all without some code showing how you are drawing this.. Closing for inactivity. @oatrice Hey, sorry for the late response. I was hoping you would just add secondary colors instead of a brand new class, but this works fine for now. Merging.. Why does no one use the issue template. Also, you clearly did NOT read the Contributing before posting this.\nClosing. Floats aren't perfect, that is something every java developer ever has dealt with. However you should be converting those floats back into integers when doing strictly integer math. This is some basic stuff, here.\nI didn't get into the discussion between you and Jetz72, but judging by the simplicity of the issue I decided the solution is equally simple. Basically, use the index i for your X index. You can pass the original time stamps into your AxisValueFormatter when you initialize it, and use that to map your indexes 1:1 with the labels.\nIt looks like all your timestamps are in steps of 3600, so this solution should not affect how the chart looks once you add the custom labels. If, however, your data is not that nice, then you can go back to using the time value, and just initialize the formatter with the original data that has integers, that way you don't have to worry about converting floats back to ints at all.. This is out of scope for MPAndroidCharts.\nSorry but you are on your own for this.. Despite such a simple question, and the fact that the answer is literally in the documentation, I feel the need to link it anyway in case someone ever tries to open an issue with the same question.\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki. If you mean that the value should be updated when dragging over each point in the chart, check out the LineChartActivity1.java class in the example app. This functionality is built-in and should work right out of the box.. Hmm... I don't know what's wrong here. Perhaps you might be animating too fast? I know, 3 seconds is a long animation, but it can be possible if your setup blocks the UI for longer than 3 seconds.\nTry using even bigger values to see if you get anything at all...\nActually wait. You are adding entries incorrectly into the bargroup2. You have specified the x and y values in the wrong order. Currently the library only supports same x values by passing an array of those values at the same x. You have put 0 and 2 into the x value 10f.\nFlip them around and let me know if that solves the problem.. It doesn't work on KitKat? Technically, it should. I'm going to keep this open to see if anyone else can confirm the animations aren't working on KitKat. I've changed the title to reflect this.. Nice work, looks fine from here.. I guess you already figured it out, but just incase others stumble upon this issue, here's the short answer:\nSet the granularity of the chart to 1f, and then add 0.5f to each x value. This way, the grid is drawn at every nth step, and every point is draw at (n + 0.5)th step, putting the points between the gridlines.. See your previous issue, please. \nAnd, please NEVER open two issues for the sake of putting your name in the issue. It's pretty dumb :/\nAnd another thing, don't be stupid. STOP\n4010\n4009. duplicate #3865. LGTM\nAnd thank you for using the template \ud83d\udc4d . You should always use the ValueFormatter or AxisValueFormatter interfaces for your data. That alone will make things easier to work with in case your data changes later.\nYou should also look at the documentation for the axes, it describes solutions to your problems.. Since this is a duplicate of multiple other issues (all in that reference to the pull request) I'm going to close it.. I guess you figured out whatever problem you had? But please, don't remove the original comment on issues next time. Someone in the future may have the same problem and come here. But alas...\nThis issue tracker is not for support questions or personal debugging. If you have questions, please go to StackOverflow and ask your questions there. You could also read the documentation, it probably has what you're looking for.. Awesome, must've been a little tedious!. Although from initial glance it definitely should fix the problem, I'm worried that it still might not. I'll come back to this later, possibly with a suggestion for a better solution, but for now I think it works.\nLot's of unnecessary styling changes, but I'll let it slide since it's literally only spacing.. This issue tracker is not for support or questions, especially not when the answer is easily found in the documentation. Just read it, I can guarantee you will find a way to do this given the currently available options. If you have tried may thing then please tell us what you tried. But, please, go to StackOverflow and ask your questions there.\nIt's a shame that so many people do not read the documentation, and also insist on blatantly ignoring the warnings present in the mandatory issue templates. Especially this one which I'm sure you already saw.. This issue tracker is not for support questions.. Why should it? If it's already readable, it will remain readable. You can manually change the text size of the value labels if you don't think it's big enough, but automatically changing the text size while zooming is just going to slow down the renderer to add an unnecessary effect.. Welp, that's a confirmed bug. Just doing \"Add Entry\" and then \"Remove Entry\" crashed the example app!. This is a well known problem, and the only solution is to just not use such big numbers. There are better ways to handle times! Use smaller integer X and Y values, and apply the AxisValueFormatter and ValueFormatter classes. You can pass the original data set and map the times 1:1\nAlso, the suggestion to convert to double values is a contender to fixing this, although this method is still not the best solution. I would almost insist on allowing you to pass a Calendar or Date object\u2014and let the DataSet class reformat them into intervals with simplified indexes\u2014before letting developers get the renderer tangled up with huge double values.\nAs I always suggest to anyone having issues with big numbers in this library, cut them down into smaller and more meaningful values! Converting the base number 1802210870 into 1802 and then value format that into 1.8B or 2B is much better for the end-user! Same with dates and the developer, pass small indexes spaced according to your time interval, and use the formatter to turn them into meaningful dates and times by passing the original timestamps into it.. This issue tracker is not for support questions or personal debugging. If you have questions, please go to StackOverflow and ask your questions there. You could also read the documentation, it probably has what you're looking for.. Charts are not designed to use such large numbers, and neither are end-users. Cut those numbers down to size! MPAndroidChart has these great features like the ValueFormatter and AxisValueFormatter which allow you to convert big numbers into more meaningful information for your users. Instead of using 526186449, cut it down and format it into 526M! Try to not blindly pump big numbers into your charts, as they are intended to help people visualize a lot of data in a simple format.. You must be joking \ud83e\udd23\n\nSTOP RIGHT THERE!\nIssues are NOT for getting help, only for reporting bugs and feature requests.\nSearch open and closed issues to see if your question already has an answer. However, do not create a new issue.\nInstead, do the following:\n\n\nDownload the Example App and check out the source code. 90% of the time there is an example that does exactly what you are trying to do.\n\n\nLook at the Wiki for the official documentation for MPAndroidChart. You can also browse the javadoc for a more detailed tutorial of the API.\n\n\nGo to StackOverflow and ask your questions there. The community will be much more helpful and willing to offer guidance.\n\n\nYou have been warned!\nFrom now on, any issues asking for help will get closed with a link to this file.\n\nAlthough this is a feature request for double x-axis, something the y-axis already has, I am closing it because you didn't understand the difference between \"I need help!\" and \"Suggest a feature,\" likely because you assumed this was already a feature since you didn't attempt to look at the documentation or read that template you left sitting at the bottom of your issue comment.\nAlso, you added the same picture twice, the original edit and second edit, without removing the original image of the same problem.. You cannot say \"like [insert name here]\" and expect someone to go researching what that is to understand what you mean when you say that. I can tell English isn't your language, because I have no clue as to what \"achieve the current depth map\" actually means.\nThis issue tracker is not for support questions or personal debugging.

If your users know how to read a candlestick chart, they ought to know which is the open and close, and do not need the chart to hold their hand and show them which one it is.\nYou can use ValueFormatter to make it more obvious what the actual numbers are :+1:.

Marking as a wontfix due to how small of a detail this is. If this library added every small detail requested it would bloat the library significantly with so many design options that finding the ones you want would be very difficult, and would make the useful ones hard to find underneath all the insignificant options.\nSince we cannot add all small design requests, we cannot add any small design requests. The only requests accepted are significant and obviously beneficial. This request is simply too small and insignificant to be worth adding, even if it makes the chart look fancier, it does not add any significant benefit.\n\nfootnote: Please refrain from using a language other than English on this issue tracker. The maintainers aren't language geeks and have to use Google Translate just to get an idea of what you're saying, and it isn't perfect.. LMAO\nSome explanation: You left this template in the body. Flawless reading skills \ud83d\udcaf \n. Thanks for figuring it out yourself, instead of doing what most people do and just wait for someone to fix it for you. \ud83d\udc4d . Oof, this issue gets spammed a lot here. Clearly a rampant bug! However, it duplicates about 10 other open issues practically word-for-word and with an identical stack trace.. I can tell you don't speak English, but that is no excuse to ignore the template completely. We live in 2018 with decent translation tools at our disposal. I don't ignore issues in other languages, I often try to translate them and answer them as best I can, but this issue simply doesn't help me understand what problem you are having.\nYou left this template in the body of the issue.. I will admit, I tried working with the bar width and gave up because it was too hard to make it look right. I've edited your issue and removed all the code, since the problem isn't really within your code, but with the confusing nature of the library on bar widths.\nI think the width should be a basic DP value, with a spacing option either in DP as well or a percentage of the bar width. Right now you can only set the bar width in terms of \"values\" which is a fairly ambiguous term, and only allows you to go up to the distance between values before they start overlapping, not actual DP values, and it won't push the bars apart if you set the value to be larger than the label interval.. Both this issue and the SO question have quite different examples, so I'll try to answer them both in a meaningful way.\nThis issue: Did you forget about setGranularity()?\nSO Question:\nRotating labels isn't perfect when it comes to angles outside 90 degree turns. It would require some trivial maths to solve, but I somewhat question the design choice for using tilted labels instead of fully horizontal or vertical labels. Using tilted over vertical is good for when the label is too long for both orientations, but using a tilted label over a horizontal one is pointless for labels which easily fit horizontally, and it only makes it harder to read.\nIt also raises the question that you may be choosing labels which are so long that they can't fit horizontally, and are also too long to be easily read when vertical. I think label rotation should be limited to either horizontal or vertical rotations only. As a UI designer, you need to question if such long labels are helpful to the user, and try to think of a creative way to shorten them without losing information.\nFor example, I have a chart that shows populations in various countries. For each axis label, I could put the full country name, but some are so long that it becomes difficult to read. Take this very real country name, \"Democratic Republic of the Congo.\" Instead of using the full name, I can safely shorten it to something like \"Congo, D-R\" without losing it's meaning. Obviously there may be shorter official names, but this is just a quick example.\n\nClosing issue, if you don't think my suggestions solve your problem, feel free to keep commenting on this post with more information.

For now, you can use the -SNAPSHOT version like this\ngradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.github.philjay:mpandroidchart:-SNAPSHOT'\n}.

We cannot help you with this.. @Deepakkast this is not the place to get programming help, please do not post code without any real explanation of why. Open an issue and follow the templates if you have a problem with the library. I think this was caused by a bug unintentionally introduced a while back. However this should only happen if you are using a non-release version based on any commits before this one d67ea481af1e8528c617dfd404d0c7827b0134b2. I noticed it too and fixed it in that exact commit. Could you please update to version 3.1.0-alpha and tell me if the problem still exists?. > Additional Context\n\nI am not using the dependency but downloaded the source and imported into project, but have not modified the files in any way(other than changing import statements due to not using dependency)\n\nAHA! Yes, just update to the latest source code for your project. However I do recommend using the dependency way as it is much easier to get updates that way.. Closing for now, just let me know if this doesn't fix your problem!. Could you please update your screenshots with as little cropping as possible? I cannot see the x-axis, which judging by the long straight line coming from the start could either mean you did something weird when setting up the chart itself or a more serious problem with the rendering.\nIf you could please create a gist with your code and link it here, I could better find what the problem may be.. Can you explain this more? Please open a new issue and use the bug report template and describe what is happening.. sorry but this issue tracker is strictly english only. We cannot help you with this.. I cannot tell what you are describing, the picture is not helping. Please follow the issue template and try again.. I'm confused, you say that all bars have the same y-value, and that causes the label to only partially render. However in the image, the bars clearly have different y-values.\nEither way, can you please create a gist with the code where you call new BarDataSet() and BarDataSet.setStackLabels()? Technically if you create a stacked data set with only one stack, then the LegendRenderer actually uses the label set initially when you do new BarDataSet().\nIn other words, a one stacked bar chart is no different from a non-stacked bar chart, so calling setStackLabels() will do literally nothing for one stack bar charts.. Honestly not sure what to do about this, as there is no easy way to change the way a stacked bar chart is considered stacked without adding a lot of clutter code. All I can tell you is that you cannot use stacked labels on a one stack chart because the render won't use that as the chart isn't stacked anyway.. \ud83d\udc4d . sorry but this issue tracker is strictly english only. We cannot help you with this.. @husuxing sorry but this issue tracker is strictly english only. We cannot help you with this.. @husuxing sorry but this issue tracker is strictly english only. We cannot help you with this.. good feature request, adding to the list.. I think that's the legend being rendered. It's hard to tell without a screenshot, so please add one!. Here's the latest example for a stacked bar chart: StackedBarActivity.java\nI suggest you look at the onProgressChanged() method, and specifically at line 131. If you aren't updating your data that way then it could be causing this. Just for the future, would you share the code you are using to change the data, as I could use it to find a way to make this less likely to happen.. As for dynamic vs. static data, the only difference is whether you decide to inflate a new chart each time you want to display data, or if you change the data itself being displayed. There should be no difference either way, but it may be easier to outright inflate a new chart if your data changes.. No. I'll do some testing soon and hopefully pull this today or tomorrow. I'm trying to get through all 1000+ issues right now so it may take longer. Thank you for your patience!. It really looks like the data being added is not right, some points are added many more times than they should be, causing the look of the same pattern being drawn many times and then sharply changing to another pattern.\nI know you said your data is correct but could you please triple check that?. That is very strange! I'm currently working through all 1000+ open issues to whittle it down to a manageable number, so I cannot help you right now. I'm adding some labels and hopefully someone else can help you in the meantime.. This is possible, please see the example app and follow the documentation.. Please follow the instructions in the templates. I cannot help you if you don't actually explain what is happening and what should happen.. Could you please provide a use case for when someone would use icons instead of numbers on a graph? I really don't see this being worth adding to the library..

A similar issue was reported and is currently being worked on.\nsome extra info: The solution will be to add a minimum slice angle option, which is currently not implemented but is being worked on!. You should be able to use getRotationAngle() for this, and then use a TextView on top of the chart to show the values. I don't know how exactly you can do this, but that should be a good start.. thank you for pointing this out. A similar issue was reported and is currently being worked on.. #4264. @titiarimba this is not added yet, please see the issue linked above. thank you for pointing this out. A similar issue was reported and is currently being worked on.. good feature request, adding to the list.. I'm not sure what you are asking about here. You can easily disable drawing values and disable highlight (selecting).. This has to be done after the views are inflated. I've done exactly this in my own project and it is sort of finicky but that's just how Android works. For activities this is done inside onCreate(), for other things like fragments you do it inside onViewCreated().. This is sadly not an actual method of the charts, but instead from the base View class which is out of scope for this library. I'm adding this to the list.. I wish I could help you out, as this is a pretty simple design question, but I really can't spend the time to help you. I'm working on updating the library to simplify it so it's easier to find what you need and customize charts. For now you just need to search through the wiki and see if you can't find what you're looking for.\nI can tell you this, however: chart.invalidate() will be your friend here..

Charts are transparent by default, so you can simply disable the gridlines and put your own drawable behind the chart. Please read the documentation for more information, which you can find in the project README.md. You can use set.setColors() with an int[] of colors. Check out this line of the example activity AnotherBarActivity. You can use as many or few colors as you want. For example, if you have 50 bars but only 3 colors, then those three colors will be repeated for all 50 bars.. Please follow the instructions in the templates. I cannot help you if you don't actually explain what is happening and what should happen.. Please follow the instructions in the templates. I cannot help you if you don't actually explain what is happening and what should happen.. I think you need to look at your value formatter, which displays the numbers on your bars and is likely causing this rounding error.\nCheck this wiki page out for more info: The ValueFormatter Interface\nAnd here is the actual class you'll use: IValueFormatter. I'm not sure how that's happened, and I would test it myself, but right now I can't exactly do that. I'm adding to the support list and hopefully you get an answer.. I don't believe that having long labels should be causing the boxes to shrink at all, so that is definitely a problem with the library! I wonder if this happens to bar charts or is a unique problem to the candlestick chart.. I'm fairly certain this is not supported at the moment, and may not be for a long time. If you have to accomplish something like this, I can only suggest to add text views beneath the chart and try to line them up as best you can. Please look through the examples and the wiki to see if anything can remedy this, but I'm pretty sure there isn't multi-line support for labels. You'll honestly need to show the labels in another way as multiple lines are probably out of the question right now.. I'm not sure if you know this, but this library was sort of abandoned for a very long time, hence over 4000 issues, 20% of which are all about the same problems, 50% are basic usage questions, and the rest are design questions that I'm slowly whittling down. Also there are many issues over 3 years old.\nThis code was added over 3 years ago by this commit: 3074744db7bb1fccbaac17f4737742c5e27ad465\nAnd it seems like nothing happened after that, so that code is just sitting there doing nothing. Multiple line support is something I would like to add, but right now I need to solve the documentation problem that causes so many simple questions to be opened all the time, as well as patching a few bugs and adding redundancy to the library to reduce the number of user errors.\nIf you'd like to create a pull request that adds this functionality, I will gladly review it some time in the future. But for now you just have to find your own solution that works until someone gets around to adding this.. This has to do with how you are adding the data to the chart. All the examples in the example app have properly centered labels, so please compare your code with that and do it correctly.. Can you please give the code that causes this, as I really can't tell what's happened to cause count to be negative. Basically, the max value in your data is actually smaller than the min, causing it to be negative.\nI'm certain this isn't the fault of the library, but rather you have done something out of order. Please create a gist of the code that is called before your chart is drawn.. Understandable, and I agree that this library needs more redundancy checks to reduce this sort of stuff from happening, as right now it's kinda fragile.. Please use the templates correctly, and also search the issues as this exact question has already been asked and I'm pretty confident it's in the project lists.. If you didn't catch that, do not open another issue about this. Thanks. Initially looking through I don't see anything that would cause this. I'm going to come back to this and try to recreate it to see what's going on. I can't give you a time estimate so for now just fiddle around with changing options until it looks right and see if you can figure it out.. Well that's funny, at least it's a pretty simple fix. I wonder if there is a way to prevent this from happening without having to manually call chart.setHardwareAccelerationEnabled(false);\n\ud83e\udd14 . So this seems to be a new problem with androidx, although I've yet to find any exact reason. I ran into a similar problem recently as well, and I have no idea what caused it or how exactly I fixed it. All you should have to do to fix this is to add this to the android { } section in your app's 'build.gradle'\ngroovy\npackagingOptions {\n    exclude 'META-INF/proguard/androidx-annotations.pro'\n}\nIf that doesn't work, then I can't really help. The best thing you can do is to search around stackoverflow.com until you find something that helps, because it seems like there are many ways this can happen.. I would actually suggest removing these lines from your dependencies to see if anything changes with the error or if it goes away completely:\ngroovy\ntestImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'\nandroidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:runner:1.0.2'\nandroidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.2'\nI think that was how I fixed the problem in a recent project I made, where all I did was create a new project, included this library, and I instantly had a problem with the 'LICENSE' file. I think I removed those lines and my app started building correctly after that.\nAnother suggestion, and I don't know if it'll work, but you could try closing Android Studio, restarting your computer, and it might work. Like I said this seems to be caused by androidx and can be caused by many different things.. Good to hear!. @Tech-AJ good to hear! But please, don't post your own solution unless it's fairly different from the one already posted. You have copied Lexar7's answer exactly, so there is no reason to post it twice.. Do you mean something like this?\n\n. @JamieKalloe I'm still have a lot of planned additions for this library, and I don't want to release alpha builds too frequently. For now you can use this in your dependencies until I create another pre-release build.\ngroovy\nimplementation 'com.github.philjay:mpandroidchart:aea2ff3417'. Blind accessibility is, regrettably, not something I can help you with. I also can't recommend adding support for it to the library. Because of that I am closing this issue as wontfix.. Unless you provide some code no one will be able to help you. Please create a gist and link it here.. So the only thing I can think of is that your entries may be getting added twice. Since you only provided the chart initialization it's obvious that it's not due to a double y-axis. If you have any code that is run depending on the version of the device, especially when you create the data (which you only showed the setup for the data set) then that could be causing this.\nBasically, from what you provided, the only thing left is that your data is being changed inside an API version check somewhere outside that code. Since I can't recreate this I'm going to close the issue.. I don't think showing circles on highlighted points is currently possible. It would be nice to have an option for this, though.. Looks like this wasn't added to Horizontal Bar charts! I'll update the renderer today and get it pushed.. All of this is possible to do, except for the black line coming off the second and third points, and the tick marks on the axes. If you have a suggestion then please make it as this chart has a lot of stuff going on and I don't know what exactly you have and what you don't have.. @Pascal66 thanks for following up! Again, if you ever had any suggestions then please open an issue and use the template.. I very recently added this sort of functionality in an update to the ValueFormatter class.\nCheck these files specifically to see how you can use it:\nStackedValueFormatter  @ e5b66192e7b303d7d25fc172b1878c055b554047\nLine 145 in StackedBarActivity @ e5b66192e7b303d7d25fc172b1878c055b554047\nYou'll need to change you dependency to something more recent like an individual commit hash or use the latest with -SNAPSHOT like this:\ngroovy\nimplementation 'com.github.philjay:mpandroidchart:-SNAPSHOT'. @Eduz6 it shouldn't be drawing the middle ones... are you sure you passed false to the initializer? Like this: Line 145 in StackedBarActivity\nIt looks weird that technically two labels are being drawn for the top-most bar, one above the top line and one below the top line. Maybe you have two value formatters somehow?. This has been mentioned a few times already, and allowing the use of multiple lines in labels is something being worked on, but I can pretty much promise it won't be as simple as using the newline \\n character in labels. I'm thinking more of allowing label formatters to return spannables or views, but I'm not sure yet.\nI'm closing this issue to keep the tracker clean (as best as I can, I guess) but just know that this will be added in a future release!. Please follow the instructions in the templates. I cannot help you if you don't actually explain what is happening and what should happen.. @asherali could you please test this to make sure it works? Just by looking at the code you wrote a function but it isn't actually called anywhere, this should at least be used in one of the examples.. @luuillu thanks for doing this, but it may be a few more days until I pull it. Hold tight!. @hamidchi I believe I already responded to you in another issue, but I'll do it here just in case.\nI personally wouldn't recommend using such large values in charts, even if you require precision. Instead, you should put the exact number somewhere else, as a chart is designed to show the data simply at a glance.\nDespite that, I would still like to add support for larger values anyway. But I can't give you a timeline of when that might be added. For now, use the chart to show the data at a glance; don't worry about high precision. Place the precise data elsewhere in your layout. That way users can glance at the chart and then determine if they really need the exact data by scrolling down or tapping the chart.\nRemember that you don't have to use the data passed to the value formatter! You can easily initialize it with a reference to an object you use to store the precise data, before converting it to a float for the chart. You get the index, and then just reference the precise object instead of the value held in the entry.. Did you figure out what caused this?. This isn't possible right now, although it might be in the future.\nI'm thinking about allowing you to pass TextViews for labels, which would allow greater customizability for labels.\nI'm closing this, because this has already been requested in the past.. The chart itself is a View, so you should be able to query for the width after it is inflated/ drawn. Let me know if that isn't what you need.. No reason for this line. Can be deleted. replace both resetAutoScaleMinRestriction() and resetAutoScaleMaxRestriction() with appropriate setUseAutoScale???Restriction() and isUseAutoScale???Restriction() getters and setters.. remove both mAutoScaleMinRestriction and mAutoScaleMaxRestriction variables. remove these two setters: setAutoScaleMinRestriction() and setAutoScaleMaxRestriction(). Indent this, so that the code checks for mUseAutoScale???Restriction ONLY if mCustomAxisMin is true, that way it uses the same mAxisMinum variable, but it two different possible ways.. Do the same with this as above.. ",

If I want to round just the top 2 corners, a solution might be to draw a regular square rect on bottom half and have it overlap the rounded rect.\nThen you have to account for the highlight color which is a completely separate bar that is overlayed on top the regular bar. That also needs to be rounded. The highlight color has some transparency to it so if you draw a square rect on bottom of the rounded highlight bar, the bottom part will be visibly darker than the top half. \nI'll just stick with the square bar, imo it looks a lot more cleaner anyways. \n.

I would also be interested in supporting this lib.\nFor now, I forked the project to add a bunch of tests to the library. I will start to fix crashes and bugs in the coming weeks.. What have you tried?. @gfdarcy Did @gibels-and-bits solution works for you? If so, can you close this issue?. The crash was already reporting in #2952.\nHave you tried setting the data before trying to animate the chart?. I don't think the project is available as a jar.\nYou should rather use it as a dependency in your project.. Found it here: https://jitpack.io/com/github/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/v3.0.3/MPAndroidChart-v3.0.3.jar (see #2428 for the original answer).. What do you mean by \"clear the X-axis\"?. I guess the solution in #3207 is a bit more elegant, and fixes other issues as well.. I guess this is the same one as in #3880. Can you close it?. @nilmarpublio can you close this issue if @NianyiYang's solution worked for you?. It looks like you got your answer on StackOverflow.\nCan you close this issue?. Have you tried one of the following methods?\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/6fbd49276168b6270a85cc8ddb2d655b0afaa1f2/MPChartLib/src/main/java/com/github/mikephil/charting/charts/Chart.java#L1071-L1141\nIn particular setExtraLeftOffset(float) and setExtraRightOffset(float).. This was already reported in #3032.\nCan you close this issue to group all related information in one place?. This was already reported in #3032.\nCan you close this issue to group all related information in one place?. Have you tried one of the following methods?\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/blob/6fbd49276168b6270a85cc8ddb2d655b0afaa1f2/MPChartLib/src/main/java/com/github/mikephil/charting/charts/Chart.java#L1071-L1141. Have you tried chart.getLegend().setEnabled(false)?. Can you close the issue if it solved your problem?. Can you close the issue if it solved your problem?. @twinkleSiya or @almic, can you close this issue, as it is fixed?. What problems?. The same way as in Java.\nWhat have you try so far? What issues do you have?. What is the stacktrace you are receiving? . Unless I'm missing something, the resource is closed in the finally block, which is called even if an exception is thrown.\nSo there should not be a memory leak here, right?. The message explains exactly what you have to do: call Utils.init(Context) before calling Utils.convertDpToPixel().. Can you share your build.gradle file?. How did you initialized barChart?. Can you show how you initialized it? Is it initialized before you call fetchJSON()?. See #3207\nA fix was merged, but probably not released.. A fix was merged in #3207 . Duplicate of #4372. return Arrays.asList(arrays);?\n. If mText is null or empty, this would add a trailing space at the end, no?\n. I guess there is no reason for this change either (and its import).. The latest version of Gradle is 4.7.. According to the doc, it should be compatible with Gradle 4.4+. If it doesn't, I guess there is a bug in either the plugin or Gradle.\n|Plugin version|Required Gradle version|\n|--------------|------------------------|\n|3.1.0+              |4.4+                                 |.

Yeah it's a separate branch...\n. Great thanks! :)\n. It seems from the log like it is a bug in one of the support classes... What do you mean by scaling two graphs?\nWhat happens when you update to latest support library with Gradle, or go to an older one?\n. @PhilJay I think we should generate new screenshots for the Pie chart ;-)\n. I think this was fixed a week ago. Please try again.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/539\n. You should try with the latest version\n. @PhilJay I think this works :-)\n. Although I think it should be enabled by default\n. In the iOS version I'm implementing something similar, and chose the more generic name \"dragDecelarationEnabled\"\n. @PhilJay please let me know when you merge it - so I'll extend it to the pie/radar charts as well\n. Well I haven't noticed any performance penalty but I'm on a simulator....\nNotice that they are not doing anything different actually... they are using the fling gesture recognizer to fetch the velocity (on the inside the calculation is the same), and when done panning it fires off a mission that moves the view as necessary using the same math.\nThe difference, and I think what gave poor performance for custom animation implementaions also- is that on the devices you need to sync with the recommended FPS of the specific device. This is done by the Choreographer class which is used by Animation classes and other classes, available publicly only since API 16.\nSo we can choose to implement the standard gesture recognizers, or leave it as it is and use the Choreographer to control the frame rate (or Google's way, which essentially does the same thing).\nThat's what I did on iOS - using the standard UIGestureRecognizers, except for radial charts because the rotation is offset by the the legend etc. so we cannot use the angle to the view's center.\nBtw, I really hate Android's blue stuff at the end of scrolling, but maybe it's because I'm coming from iOS... I love the bouncing, and I think I'll try to implement it in the line-based charts. Maybe we need to keep this detail platform specific- EdgeEffect for android and bounce for iOS?\n. Dammit, OverScroller is only supported in API >= 9\n. I have an implementation ready, here: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/612\n@mesropd It's kind of an evolution of what you did, only going through the changes I've done in iOS version then the adjustments for Android methods according to Google recommendations, so you might not recognize it ;-)\n. Not currently, but it would involve adding an interface for fetch the color for a bar based on it's value. Not too complicated.\n. Maybe we should just add the \"custom\" boolean flag, as people may want to manually calculate their legends anyway...\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/657\n. :-)\n. You now have the task of updating the docs and screenshots... Lol\n. Well there's a range of size values that the user specifies, and the largest size must fit in its column without overlapping with those beside it.\nSo (chartWidth / xValueCount) * (entrySize / maxSize).\nIf you have 500px wide chart, and only two values on the x-axis,\nThen 250px is the max size for the bubble. Then you apply the relative size of the individual entry...\nQuite simple actually!\n. Well it does try to take both height and width into consideration, which I\nsupposed is wrong? We could easily remove the Math.max there, but we need\nto be sure. I'll look at some images of such charts and then I'll know\nmore...\n. By the way, the Square Root there - is a standard for compensating for the way the brain interprets the bubble sizes. All Bubble Charts are supposed to be calculated this way so the brain can detect the correct difference between bubbles by their sizes, and the docs should say that the bubbles are sqrted...\n. It is correct- different DataSets usually contain different kind on information, so it's not a problem...\nYour implementation seem to be doing the same thing it did previously, only on the x axis only...\nI'm not sure yet that we should ignore the height, as the biggest bubble still should't overflow on the y axis,\nBut the bigger problem here is that you did not sqrt the size...\n. The human visual system\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_visual_system naturally\nexperiences a disk's size in terms of its area\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area. And the area of a disk\u2014unlike its\ndiameter http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter or circumference\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference\u2014is not proportional to its\nradius http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius, but to the square of the\nradius. So if one chooses to scale the disks' radii to the third data\nvalues directly, then the apparent size differences among the disks will be\nnon-linear and misleading. To get a properly weighted scale, one must scale\neach disk's radius to the square root\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root of the corresponding data\nvalue _v_3 This scaling issue can lead to extreme misinterpretations,\nespecially where the range of the data has a large spread. And because many\npeople are unfamiliar with\u2014or do not stop to consider\u2014the issue and its\nimpact on perception, those who are aware of it often have to hesitate in\ninterpreting a bubble chart because they cannot assume that the scaling\ncorrection was indeed made. So it is important that bubble charts not only\nbe scaled in this way, but also be clearly labeled to document that it is\narea, rather than radius or diameter, that conveys the data.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart\n. Did you SQRT it?\nYeah I think we are there just let me a few hours to look at it :-)\nOn Mon, May 4, 2015 at 6:08 PM, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nOkay, I have made some adjustments and it now takes width and height into\nconsideration but fully scaling up even in landscape mode.\nI think we are ready for a new release, what do you say?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/608#issuecomment-98743149\n.\n. Okay we have a problem... When zooming in the bubbles do not keep their relative sizes\n. When zooming on X only\n. They should get bigger - but when zooming on X only - they get too big in relation to the others\n. Yeah but I'm not sure that's right. Maybe add an option to choose to have it relative to Y axis too?\n. It actually is never limiting it on the Y axis!\nBecause you are taking min-y and max-y which will always be the edges of the Chart, even beyond the viewport, when zoomed in...\n. It limits up to the x axis point - I don't see any y axis limit...\n. Yeah, that's because in Landscape the Y axis is short :-)\n. How can we calculate the actual distance between two Y-lines - without hacking access to the YAxis renderer computed data?\n. Yes but y values can be 10-20-30 or 10-15-20-30, I don't see how the\ntransformer or viewport contains information about the visible y values\n\n\u200f\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05da \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9, 4 \u05d1\u05de\u05d0\u05d9 2015, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com \u05db\u05ea\u05d1:\n\nWell with the transformer you can transform the bounds of the viewport\n(top and bottom) to y-values, and then derive the currently visible range\nfrom them\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/608#issuecomment-98843562\n.\n.

Well, not perfect but reasonable :-)\nI think the best algorithm to choose the limits will eventually be setter properties for the user to adjust...\n\nWhy did you revert the Transformer changes?

It seems like sometimes the deceleration\ntriggers into the opposite direction of the fling gesture.\nBut other than that, I could not see any issues even on lower android\nversions. [image: :+1:]\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/612#issuecomment-98077428\n.\n. Yes I'm working on it. It's not that simple but I think I have a solution\n. Ok, I've come to a conclusion that there's no shortcuts in this...\nThe only reason that we know with our eyes what is the direction that the circle moved, is because we've seen it move.\nWhen we watch a wheel go around, the brain tracks the rotation and as long as it can catch a movement of less than 180 degrees per frame - it assumes that it moved in that direction. If it's more than 180 - the brain/eyes get confused.\n\nSo what I'm doing is building a velocity tracker that tracks the angles instead of the points, and while tracking it will look at the direction. The built-in VelocityTracker can't do that as it tracks points.\nI'll post the changes soon!\n. This doesn't look like a drawing code, but showing a Toast. \nAnyway, the Chart is drawing itself - you cannot add custom drawing code to it. You may want to add a transparent View over it and draw whatever you want.\n. Well 3 finger gestures are more complicated when they have to live together with two finger gestures.\nThink about the tap and double-tap gestures working together. The solution to that specific case is actually delaying the decision whether there was a tap, until we are sure that there weren't a double-tap! Which causes a huge annoying delay in mobile platforms.\nNow here you have a one-finger drag, and a two finger scale. They both wait for a treshold to be passed before they decide to start \"eating\" the touches.\nI think that what is missing here is just making the gestures aware that there might be gestures with more fingers involved - and thus stop counting towards the treshold if a 3rd finger was added (ACTION_POINTER_DOWN). Right now it looks for getPointerCount() >= 2 which is nice to allow the accidental extra finger, but we shouldn't allow it if it were added before passing the treshold.\nYou can play with that a little and see if it solves the problem, and then send a PR ;-)\n. You could have expressed that better as a feature request, and this is a duplicate of https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/133 anyways...\n. This is an interesting one... Are you sure nothing was done to the legend maybe? An offset?\n@PhilJay could that be the equivalent of the \"jumps\" we had on the x-axis grid lines up until a month ago?\n. I'm actually working on word-wrapping the legend for my needs, and will be soon available in both ios and android versions.\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/702\n. For whatever is in the middle, you could draw behind the chart or over it.\nFor the icons, there's a PR pending, but not allowing labels simultaneously I think. @PhilJay do you want to accept the icons PR to a separate branch so I can work on it and improve before merging?\n. Yes that's what I thought... I'll look into it\nOn Wed, May 27, 2015 at 10:50 AM, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI just merged the PR with some modifications into the experimental branch.\nYou can check it out there. I didn't really like that the integration of\nthe images was tied to the x-axis. It like it more to have a PieEntry\nwith a separate constructor that allows to add bitmaps.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/691#issuecomment-105806974\n.\n. Yes :-)\nWhen you change the viewport to show only a subset of the data (for example by scaling on the x axis) - it causes the y axis to scale to that subset of data.\n\nYou can see an explanation here: https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts/issues/89\n. This feature was proposed by @AlBirdie which works with financial charts, and is required by him. So this opens up more possibilities for those working with financial charts.\n. Well the viewport handler has offsets, but the problem is that the chart is auto-calculating offsets based on legends - and you might want to modify that relative to whatever calculation is done.\nAnd because legends are not the only offsets applied, and there are also minimum offsets etc. - you will want in most cases to just append to the offsets and not replace them in the viewporthandler...\n. Do you really not see the point in this? I have people (and I) asking fir an option to adjust the legend's spacing- while keeping the automated calculation...\nWhen do not really want to calculate the size of the legend yourself, but you decide that the spacing is too much or not enough\n. It is passed through restrainViewPort in calculateOffsets.\nsetViewPortOffsets is an alternative, that sets your custom offsets - without accounting for legends etc. - that's for when you really know what you are doing.\nBut in most cases, you want the chart to calculate the offsets itself, and then add some\n. There are other cases where it is not ideal - think of a \"1\" value - the bar will still be too small to show the label. So just hiding zeros is not the proper solution. We may want to do it conditionally on whether there is space for drawing the values or not.\n. Well, the path is too large. Android's renderer does not know how to cut a path to the visible part and render only that. It tries to allocate a bitmap for the whole thing. If there won't be a systematic solution, we'll need to come up with a way to cut the path ourselves, which is complex when there's curved paths.\n. Before, there were bugs drawing the last point etc. Sometimes curves turned into lines etc. We changed things a little to fix that...\n. Yes the min/max got flipped... My bad!\nOn Wed, Jun 3, 2015 at 12:34 AM, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIf yes, I'll change it :-)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/713#issuecomment-108104600\n.\n. Oh yes\n\nOn Wed, Jun 3, 2015 at 12:38 AM, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNah thats not what I meant, its about the parameter and the local variable\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/713#issuecomment-108105455\n.\n. It happened to the other function as well. The culprits of copy-paste. Should have used Shift-F6...\n. Yeah :-)\n. @PhilJay , @gjpc just found the source of this problem. All the people having this problem seem to be having one thing in common: They are giving y arrays which are not ordered.\n\nIn many places we are checking \"is the value out of the viewport already?\" -> \"we can stop looping. break\".\nNow if the values are not ordered, we are stopping prematurely.\nSo we have to decide... Either:\n1. Remove those checks, and just keep doing bound checks on all values. <-- May require performance comparisons on 10K points (we are applying the matrices + bounds checks on more points)\n2. Just state that y value arrays must be ordered.\nActually when the viewport is zoomed in on the right edge of the chart, we already having the \"performance penalty\" of extra matrix multiplications, as we are not breaking out of the loop for the values on the left.\nSo there's a simple way to test the first case, without changing the code. Having a 10K points, and zooming in on the left, then playing a little. That will give the \"normal\" performance. Then go do the same on the other end of the chart. If it feels slower, then we have a problem.\n. I think that's a compromise that everyone will be willing to take. It's much faster to just sort the yValues array once by the user [of the library] instead of looping through 10K values on each render loop.\n. I can also deduce that intuitively, but you know, you never know...\n. I do not see how that description indicates that information will be lost.\nOn Wed, Jun 17, 2015 at 5:52 PM, Gerard J. Cerchio <notifications@github.com\n\nwrote:\nAs noted above, ordering the data will lose information from some data\nsets.\nFrom Wikipedia:\nA scatter plot is used when a variable exists that is under the control\nof the experimenter. If a parameter exists that is systematically\nincremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the control\nparameter or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the\nhorizontal axis. The measured or dependent variable is customarily plotted\nalong the vertical axis. If no dependent variable exists, either type of\nvariable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate\nonly the degree of correlation (not causation) between two variables.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/718#issuecomment-112830159\n.\n. Nobody wanted you to changed neither your X values or Y values, only to put\nthem in the correct order in the array..............\n\nOn Wed, Jun 17, 2015 at 6:01 PM, Gerard J. Cerchio <notifications@github.com\n\nwrote:\nTo go back to my example, a wilder beast will not only travel north and\nsouth over time but it will travel both east and west. The X axis is the\neast-west position of the animal on ground. if you order the east west data\nit will not reflect the actual travel of the animal, it falsely show that\nthe animal moves only in an easterly direction.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/718#issuecomment-112834661\n.\n. We are going round and round. Nobody asked you to moved it on the x axis, but on the \"i\" axis. The index in the array. NOT the x-index, just index in the y-values array:\n\n[\n{ xIndex: 0, yValue: value... },\n{ xIndex: 1, yValue: value... },\n{ xIndex: 2, yValue: value... },\n{ xIndex: 3, yValue: value... }\n]\nInstead of \n[\n{ xIndex: 0, yValue: value... },\n{ xIndex: 3, yValue: value... },\n{ xIndex: 1, yValue: value... },\n{ xIndex: 2, yValue: value... }\n]\nCapiche?\n. each entry has an x-index by itself, independent of its position inside the array\n. Man you are not listening.\n. For each entry you pass an X index and a Y value. These are whatever you\nlike, you do not need to change anything until now.\nThe entries are in an array. The order of the entries in the array should\nbe in relation to their x-indexes.\nSo all you have to do is sort the array, nothing more. Do not touch the\nEntries.\n. It shouldn't destroy anything. Rendering is based on x indexes, not on\narray location .\n. I thought you are talking about scatter charts. The only case where the\norder has any visual significance is when lines connect the dots...\n\u200f\n. For god sakes. @mirage89. This is an OPEN SOURCE project. Phil is not working for you. The fact that even one line of code from this project is free and available to you, is a gift that you should really not take for granted.\nWhen I saw this response, I really did not want to lower myself to this level and actually dignify this with a response. But this is for everyone who might ever read this:\n- Phil does not work for you\n- Phil invested a lot of time in this library\n- Phil is not payed by ANYONE to spend time here and answer issues\n- Phil is most likely receiving about 2 donations a year, of about 2$ each. So donations do not really play any part here.\n- Phil and I are inviting any one who is not satisfied with the \"service\" he gets here, to go and pay real money for commercial products and stop wasting our time.\n. If you omit some values in the yVals array (Take for example the BarChart sample, and let the data loop start from 10 instead of 0), it all works fine, except Highlights.\nWhat happens is getEntryForXIndex returns the closest entry to the selected xIndex, which would result in a Highlight drawing when tapping a place where there's no value. And that highlight will take the height of the closest bar...\nAnd then there's an issue with some highlights refusing to draw, depending on the xIndex. That's because of the < yValCount rule - where the yValCount does not actually represent any relation to the x indexes\n. You should set a font that supports Arabic characters. The font the Phil set in the demo is a special font, not the default font, and it includes only Latin characters\n. Can't you just look at the code and find out?..\n. Is this Persian?\n. Does your language have characters significantly wider than the others?\n. How many characters are being cut?\n. It looks to me like it measures the \"longest labels\" for the wrong label.\nIt counts the characters, but if you have a very narrow characters, or a\ncharacter the modifies another character for punctuations or something\nsimilar, it may deduce the wrong longest label. We may need to change\nbehaviour to actually measure all the labels...\n. Yes it's based on your code - it's the same for vertical bars as for\nhorizontal bars. It worked for me on iOS :-)\nThe only thing that's different in your calculations for horizontal bars\nare left/right/top/bottom flipping, but receiving data with the same\nmeaning. This is way you can take the exact same code...\n. Yes it's very useful! And it actually surprised me how easy it was to allow\nthis, by changing only a few lines of code to support the negative values..\nYes highlighting is a mess, we'll need to take the negativeSum +\npositiveSum as the size of the bar, starting from -negativeSum, so it\ndoesn't sound too tricky to me...\nOn Wed, Jun 24, 2015 at 11:07 AM, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nSounds great!\nDid you check out the age distribution charts that are now possible with\nthis?

I know we've talked about it in the past and you don't have to merge it - but I saw that you stated you chose performance over readability. And I did something different this time, I used a single if instead of inline mInverted ? ... : ..., so there's the exact same performance now ;-)\n. It becomes crucial to remove duplicate code when we're actually changing the code there and we have to be careful to attend to the duplicates too\n. Why bot just move to Android Studio? Eclipse is not designed for Android.\n. Well actually no. Android Studio is not eclipse even in a small percentage.\nIt's an Android IDE. There are so many aspects of Android that eclipse is\nnot aware of. And it was generally just hell to work with eclipse to build\nfor Android and that's the reason Google closed a deal with JetBrains to\ncreate Android Studio.\n\n\nWith Android Studio it will just compile it. Try and you'll see.\n. LOL\n. Because it's funny to see the \"magic\" of Android every time with a\ndifferent aspect.\nIn other words: If something would not draw- I'd accept it as software vs.\nhardware issues. But the axis drawing inverted? Without any more\ninformation I can only deduce that your ROM is faulty, implementing the\nnative matrix functions in a wrong way, or having the Zero matrix\ninitialized to an inverted matrix or something similar.\nEvery vendor is doing whatever he likes. And sometimes it's not even the\nvendor's fault- it could be the user installing some custom ROM.\n. Well you're claiming that the SAME code, works on one Android but behaves\nabnormally on another. Did I not understand you?\n. Well nobody is forcing you to agree, I just offered my understanding of it.\nIf something works on one device and not on the other, it means in most\ncases that there's a critical difference. In my experience it's a result of\ncustom roms. I've had trouble with Asus roms for example, modifying the way\nlong-press works, and HTC roms modifying the way that Gyroscope sensor data\nis translated in the API. They could easily modify something else, and the\nuser could easily install a completely custom ROM.\nYou should test on more devices.\n. If so, then the problem is clearly in your HTC. I found myself writing a\nlot of code to specifically handle HTC roms.\nAnyway, I would try to initialize a Matrix on HTC and on another device,\nand compare their values.\nBecause a transformation matrix controls where we draw our axis labels, and\nconvert our chart points to pixels etc. - it is reasonable to think that\nsomething is wrong with the matrix mechanism. (It's basically the stuff in\nViewPort/Transformer)\n. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/844\n. chart.setNoDataTextDescription(\"\");\n. You have probably replaced the Touch Listener of the chart by your own. This means that the code handling zoom and panning is no longer there.\nYou can keep a reference to the original listener, and pass the events to it after you are done with them.\n. @PhilJay I think we could move the calculations code back to the renderers, and keep a small buffer to prevent allocations. i.e. a buffer for Rect, a buffer for Point etc.\n. This was actually done already for line charts, and will be done to the other ones when we have spare time...\n. Well it's really fine as I'm quite too, getting married in 3.5 weeks... :-)\n. In order to be able to see what's going on here - you MUST REBASE  this PR. Clean it up, and squash it.\n. This looks like a layout problem, not a chart problem. Your view turns out a lot smaller, and the text is overlaid by another piece of text. So you need to investigate your layout\n. @PhilJay do you recall any changes in onMeasure or the likes?\n. Duplicate https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/449\n. Did you measure what difference does that actually give?\n. It's micro optimization and it means nothing\n\u200f\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05da \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9, 2 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8 2015, Steven Zhu notifications@github.com\n\u05db\u05ea\u05d1:\n\n@danielgindi https://github.com/danielgindi Depends on the data size,\nit's slightly better.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/1029#issuecomment-144922688\n.\n.

Yeah I know :)\n. It looked the same before, only the labels of the x-axis were not vertically aligned correctly when not rotated...\n\nPeople can play with the offsets in any case..\n. Do you want to make a PR for that? :-)\n. Well I'm not sure about 1 as that would mean \"keep the matrix the same\", while the data changed to something invalid or to \"no data\".\nWe do want, I think, to scale the axis and stuff to zero in \"invalid\" cases- and we have encountered several different cases where data could be invalid, possibly because of mistakes of users, mistakes in in input data etc.\n. 2.2.3 :-)\nThe new version should be 2.2.2, and this should wait for the next one...\n. I think this can be merged now\n. No idea. That's why crosses do not have holes ;-)\nIf you find out- let me know! lol\n. If I read the code correctly - it is backwards compatible, adjusting the mixAxis accordingly right?\nIn this case I don't see any problem, except maybe that it is not that clear to people that they can use NaN values in floats... It would work better in Swift, where values can be nullable so its clear that the minimum is optional.\n. Note that I removed the Buffer classes for candle drawing - as they it much harder maintaining the drawing code. Here I still use a preallocated buffer - but local, and with less processing (iterating once instead of twice over all data).\n. I think we need to update the candlestick screenshot :-)\n. Are you sure you are testing the right branch?\nBecause on my device it works great :)\nThe hole allows solid colors and transparent colors, as well as the \"transparentCircle\"...\nI'll test also to see that the branch was pushed correctly\n. Yes it does not work when there's no inner-radius. I need to push the inner corners and keep them sharp... I'll figure out the relation between the number of slices and the distance to push, and update the Pr :-)\n. @PhilJay It seems like the stroke method has another problem!\nWhen the slice is small and the stroke is wide - the stroke overflows to the other side...\n\nI've asked a question about this in math-exchange...\nhttp://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1662812/calculating-distance-from-pie-center-for-correct-slice-spacing\n. @PhilJay it's done!\nI ended up tearing the problem down like in geometry lessons in school, breaking into smaller shaped and smaller formulas until I figured out how to define the problem.\n. Well first there's a hole color that you need to set, maybe to something with transparency. Like 0x50ffffff, is a semi-transparent white.\nAlso setting chart.setHoleColorTransparent(false) will tell it that we do not expect the color to be transparent, which means that we will not try to expand the center point into inner arcs as \"we don't care what's behind the hole color as it's not transparent\". So this will end up with full pie-slices, and the transparent hole color over it!\nI've implemented it this way in iOS to begin with, to keep compatibility with the effect that is produces on Android with most combination of flags and colors...\n. I think you are right in both cases. Now that we have a unified implementation - where we draw what we want and do not rely on hacks - then we can actually put order to things.\nBut we do need to allow the same effect of having full pie slices - with the hole (and the \"transparent\" circle) over them. That's just about all that setHoleColorTransparent is doing, so we need a new name for it, maybe flip its value, and keep the original name marked as @Deprecated, calling the new one.\nWe should also mention in comments in what version a deprecated method is expected to be completely removed, and this way we can get rid of old stuff without breaking things without warning :-)\n. Nope, I'm on other stuff, you can go ahead :-)\nBasically work to be done is:\n1. \"transparent circle\" - always draw if properties are specified\n2. \"setHoleColorTransparent\" - change to something like \"setHoleCutsSlices\" or \"setHoleHidesSlices\" or something like that.\n3. Maybe the transparent circle should get a new name also?\n4. Backwards compatibility :-)\n. Go ahead :)\n. There's a slight api naming difference there - in iOS it was called \"custom...\" for historical reasons with other similar property names there to confuse - but it will be changed soon as clutter in the library reduces (i.e no more startAtZero etc.).\nAnyway, lineChart.rightAxis.customAxisMax = yMax should work. You can actually see this working in the demos.\nIf it's not working - you may want to check what is actually the max that you are setting, and that the other axis is synchronized (or disabled).\n. Also - please specify the version of Charts that you are working with :-)\n. There are better, built-in methods in Android to draw multiline text. \nThere's actually a drawing function prepared for that in the Utils of MPAndroidCharts.\n. Those functions support newlines as well, and use the OS's layout functions\nto lay them out, no synthetic line heights etc.\nEven when word wrapping is not desired- those functions should be used,\njust without a width constraint.\n. Take a look at drawMultilineText in Utils.\n. Issue 1: I'm looking into this!\nFor issue 2: This shouldn't happen as I made a fix for that - which was due to Android modding the arc angle (drawing arc from 0 to 0), So I used a circle instead.\n. Okay so the hole you see is definitely because of slice spacing.\nWe are now calculating what is the minimum inner radius we need to keep the slice spacing evenly distributed.\nIf the hole was not present - the spacing was not even because if you draw the line into the center point - the angle of the spacing changes.\nBut I think there's a way around that - I'm trying to improve the formula :-)\n. Update: I've managed to fixed the case where hole is disabled. Still there's a bug with holes enabled.\nI'll push the code when I'm finished with this\n. Okay it seems like the math was okay - just the logic was a bit flawed. Didn't think of all the different combinations of cases...\n. Phil do you want to see if you are still experiencing the flicker with 1 or 2 pie slices?\n. Basically in this case it creates a path with a circle (CCW) inside a circle (CW) - and it did work for me. I don't know why you are still seeing this...\nWell, I'm going to sleep, will look at it tomorrow :-)\n. @RudolfHladik The issues are fixed. You can add the jar release to your project, or wait until there's a gradle release\n. Does this happen on master? Or just 2.2.3?\n. 2.2.3 is not relevant. It is fixed later, and we will release soon.\n. This actually does not entirely fix the double-tap. I think we should use one of the new animated move-and-zoom functions here\n. Done beautifully on the first take, conforming to the style of the framework on both Android and iOS. Thank you!\n. It seems like people are using it... So I'm not really sure about this :)\n. And master? (Not the release version, just the latest code on master branch)\n. If anyone could supply a piece of code that we can copy-paste into one of the examples and experience the crash - that would be great. It will help in solving the issue.\n. Nope. This is incorrect. #1536 existed before this change.\n. Your patch does not pass correct values so bugs could appear when zooming in + scrolling + animating.\nWe don't have a solution yet- because we cannot reproduce the issue\n. Oh no, this is not entirely correct. It should call super, to allow it to do whatever it wants to do. It just that super should check for a null xAxis object.\n. There's a new demo - check it out :-)\n. Well this value should depend on the output of the formatter, and maybe other user choices.\nSo I think it should just be defaulted to false\n. I think that granularity should stay completely manual, people can do a simple calculation based on their formatters... Otherwise the would start opening many issues about this like this one :-)\n. Not stupid, it's just that we don't have the money to hire enough people to answer those issues ;-)\n. That was just an oversight :-) Fixed now!\n. You're welcome :-)\n. This allows, for example, this: https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/issues/840\n. Hi guys!\nA cubic bezier is actually doing exactly what you are describing. That's the way it is. It's not a bug, it's not a feature, it's math.\nBut - on master, you'll see a new feature for an \"horizontal\" bezier.\nYou set the dataset's mode, ds.setMode(HORIZONTAL_BEZIER).\nThat will calculate the control points on the horizontal axis only, and prevent them from having any effect on the vertical axis.\nThis will most probably achieve the effect you are looking for.\n@PhilJay the original implementation for cubic beziers stayed the same, there's just the new feature which we need to point out for the people, in the next release notes ;-)\n. chart.setData(data)\nAs long as data is null - the text will show. But there's also setNoDataText(...) and setNoDataTextDescription(...) to control what the text is...\n. The code on master is not released yet. When there will be a release it will get to Maven.\nI know that it's much easier to compile the project through Maven than to compile directly - but we can't simply push releases for any new feature. Those need time to sink in, to find bugs, and to improve.\n. It is well demonstrated in the demo \n. Is this actually tested and proved to be worth it?\nAs it can easily get out of hand - if someone forgets to recycle a size or a point, or returns too early etc.\nAlso the overhead of taking an FSize from the pool and returning it - might sometimes be more costly than just allocating - or preallocating a single instance private to the class.\n. Also all of that overhead just for the sake of pooling long-running objects like a formatter in the example, or an ZoomJob - that's just nonsense.\n@PhilJay ?\n. How is caching the string formatter giving you any benefit? It does not make any sense. These are set once - and reused as a variable. There's no reason to cache them.\nWell if the user neglecting to recycle an FSize or a point is not an issue - then it's logical to consider it not being an issue if not taken from the pool at all.\nIt seems like there's some good work here on the object pools, but in some cases it's just an overkill...\n. Please, better naming for the PR next time.... I don't think that (#2467) will fix it. An EPSILON is \"pretty much\" a zero in computer science, and there's a reason it's there. It's for cases that users have encountered where a number got down to zero but because of rounding issues it actually got to an EPSILON.\nAnd a value of \"1\" is surely greater than EPSILON...\nThere's an issue there and I'll investigate.\n.

Having graph entries stemming from different time intervals (i.e. one entry after an hour, the next one 5 minutes later and the next one 20 minutes later) will result in three datapoints shown in the graph.

    "Yasir-Ghunaim": "@klassm and @literakl,\nCheck my comment to know how to use timestamps with MPAndroidChart: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/789#issuecomment-241507904\n. Note: below solution was implemented using the following version:\n\ncompile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.0.0-beta1'\n\nThis workaround is based on the implementation of \"DayAxisValueFormatter.java\" suggested previously by @PhilJay. Final result looks like this:\n\nSteps:\n1. Expressing x values in timestamps:\nSay, for example, we have this data set:  \n| x | y |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| 2016-01-01 15:00:00 GMT | 25 |\n| 2016-01-01 22:00:00 GMT | 58 |\n| 2016-01-02 08:00:00 GMT | 36 |\n| 2016-01-02 14:00:00 GMT | 12 |\n| 2016-01-02 19:00:00 GMT | 29 |\nWe would like to populate a MPAndroidChart LineChart instance with above date set but we can only do so using a float type in the form: Entry(float x, float y). One easy way to handle this obstacle is to convert all dates to timestamps to get this result:\n| x | y |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| 1451660400 | 25 |\n| 1451685600 | 58 |\n| 1451721600 | 36 |\n| 1451743200 | 12 |\n| 1451761200 | 29 |\nNow, it seems like we should be good to go but one final adjustment is still required. When I tried these huge x values, my chart became really slow especially when zooming in and out. \n2. Converting timestamps to small numbers:\nAs a solution to this, we can further manipulate these x values by using this conversion:\nXnew = Xold - reference_timestamp\n\nXnew: timestamp after conversion\nXold: original timestamp\nreference_timestamp: first timestamp in our sorted data set in ascending order.\n\nFirst timestamp in a sorted data set should be the minimum timestamp which can be perfectly used as a zero reference. In that case, if we apply this equation to our sorted data set such as:\nreference_timestamp = 1451660400\nwe get this new data set:\n| x | y |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| 0 | 25 |\n| 25200 | 58 |\n| 61200 | 36 |\n| 82800 | 12 |\n| 100800 | 29 |\n\nWe can even reduce these numbers by converting from seconds timestamps to minutes timestamps if that is really needed. \n\nMake sure to keep reference_timestamp stored in a global variable so that you can retrieve your original timestamp when needed. \n3. Applying ValueFormatter to show x labels of hours and minutes:\nAt this moment, your chart should be working smoothly but your x axis will show labels that has no meaning to your user. Let's add some meaning to our x axis by using this value formatter which provides a nice label to our dataset in hours and minutes (HH:mm):\nHourAxisValueFormatter.java\nYou can apply it in this way:\nAxisValueFormatter xAxisFormatter = new HourAxisValueFormatter(referenceTimestamp);\nXAxis xAxis = mChart.getXAxis();\nxAxis.setValueFormatter(xAxisFormatter);\n4. Set a MarkerView to show a popup containing the full date and time when a value is highlighted:\nMore details about MarkerView can be found here wiki.\nUse MyMarkerView.java to show full date and time when a value is pressed. Implementation is easy just call setMakerView() like this:\nMyMarkerView myMarkerView= new MyMarkerView(getApplicationContext(), R.layout.my_marker_view_layout, referenceTimestamp);\nmChart.setMarkerView(myMarkerView);\nR.layout.my_marker_view_layout is found here: custom_marker_view.xml\nand @drawable/marker2 is found here: marker2.png\n. @gmkdev\nPlease refer to my last comment. I revised the whole comment and provided more explanations. \n@LeslieJG\nI added more details about MyMarkerView layout in my last comment. See last two lines. Best of luck.\n. @hammadtariqsahi \nActually, my x-axis values start from 0 (refer to data set shown in the second step in my guide). The formatted (HH:mm) x values you are seeing in the provided screenshot are simply a result of a ValueFormatter that translates the converted timestamps (x values) to a more user friendly format.\n. @DivyaBansal Could you point out which methods were changed as I am not keeping up with latest updates? \nAlternatively, refer to this version that I initially used:\n\ncompile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.0.0-beta1'\n\nand compare MarkerView methods in this version against latest version. . @adriamt I noticed this problem earlier but didn't know how to fix it. Based on several experiments, existing algorithm places labels at multiples of 100s, 1000s, 5000s which doesn't look nicely with seconds and minutes. I think one way would be to explore AxisBase and ComponentBase classes and see whether you can manipulate their algorithm so that labels are positioned at every an hour or at every multiple of 3600 (i.e. at 3600, 7200, etc). \nOnce you achieve that, you might want to provide an offset to this labeling mechanism so that if your reference timestamp doesn't start at the exact beginning of an hour, you could simply shift the multiples of 3600 to match your data set structure. .

Heads up, if you're using a unix timestamp, it gets converted to Float and it loses precision, so lots of timestamps that actually represent different times end up being rounded and represented as the same x value. See #2891. Please consider reopening this issue.\nThe fact that one has to employ a workaround in order to chart Unix timestamps makes it pretty clear that there is a problem introduced by this library's reliance on float values. Discussing the strengths and weaknesses of float values only serves to divert attention from an issue that could be resolved by a change to this library. There is a fundamental flaw in representing chart data with imprecise float values.\nJust like @Jetz72, I don't mean to diminish the great work that has been done here, and I don't want to come across as self-entitled or deserving of an immediate solution to this problem, which I have not presented myself.\nHowever, this really is a big deal, and makes it very difficult to implement a chart which plots anything against Unix timestamps - an extremely common reference value. How these timestamps are represented to the user is the responsibility of the ValueFormatter and really has nothing to do with which data type x and y values are stored against for the plotting of the chart. A consumer of this library should not have to perform preprocessing or otherwise mutate their source data so that it can be charted, only to mutate it back to its original value and then format it to present it accurately to the users.\nI've seen a few similar issues where the solution has been 'use smaller values' or 'users don't want to see big numbers'. I cannot stress enough that this issue really has nothing at all to do with what the end user sees. Again, that is the responsibility of the ValueFormatter. The problem here, is that Unix timestamps cannot be accurately represented by 32 bit floats in Java.\nI think possibly the point being overlooked here is that, while FLOAT_MAX contains a huge number of digits (~45?), seemingly more than one could ever possibly need, the precision of Java floats is only 6-7 digits. So converting a Unix timestamp to a float causes data corruption, since they are (presently) 10 digits. This is entirely an issue about the preservation and plotting of data which requires a precision greater than that which float can hold, and easily resolved by migrating to double values.. Hi @PhilJay. I'd love to help out, but i don't think I've got all that much to offer. Mostly I was just trying to collate all the instances of this particular issue. \nI have a bit of a habit of forgetting about libraries that I'm not actively integrating! I'll have a think about it, I appreciate the offer..

See #2891. The solution is to represent chart values with Double instead of Float.\nSee #2891. @devnokiyo thanks for attempting to solve this issue.\nUnfortunately, your PR doesn't really solve the issue of this library's reliance on floats - you have changed float to double in a bunch of places, but then in various places these doubles are being cast back to float. This is a 'lossy conversion', meaning that the original double data is lost, as it cannot be accurately stored in a float.\nA proper solution to this problem will require completely eliminating doubles. Unfortunately, there are some libraries (such as android.graphics.matrix) which don't support double, so these would have to be replaced.\nAs is, this change just masks the problem to some degree. The charts will still render data inaccurately if that data is represented by more than 6-7 digits.. I'm not a maintainer of this library, but I would argue that this PR probably can't be accepted, as it doesn't fix the problem correctly. It actually introduces errors, as it allows users to input double values and then silently performs a lossy conversion which causes those doubles to become inaccurate..

Thank you in advance.\n. Finally I added extra one dataset for each original DataSet to overcome this highlighting problem.\n. use CustomXAxisValueFormatter like something in my composed example below:\n\n```\npublic class CustomXAxisValueFormatter implements XAxisValueFormatter {\nprotected SimpleDateFormat mFormat;\nprivate float mMidScale = 2f;\nprivate float mMaxScale = 4f;\n public CustomXAxisValueFormatter(SimpleDateFormat sdf) {\n    // maybe do something here or provide parameters in constructor\n    mFormat = sdf;\n}\n@Override\npublic String getXValue(String original, int index, ViewPortHandler viewPortHandler) {\n    String strRet = \"\"; \ntry { \n    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();\n    Date date = mFormat.parse(original);\n    cal.setTime(date);\n    final int yyyy = cal.get(Calendar.YEAR);\n    final int MM = 1 + cal.get(Calendar.MONTH);\n    final int dd = cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);\n    final int HH = cal.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);\n    final int mm = cal.get(Calendar.MINUTE);\n\n    if (viewPortHandler.getScaleX()>=mMaxScale) { //the 1st kind\n        strRet = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, \"%02d %02d %4d\", dd, MM, yyyy);\n    } else if (viewPortHandler.getScaleX()>=mMidScale) { //the 2nd kind\n        strRet = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, \"%02d %4d\", MM, yyyy);\n    } else { //the 3rd kind\n        strRet = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, \"%4d\", yyyy);\n    } \n}catch (ParseException pe){\n    Log.e(\"LOG_TAG\", pe.getMessage());\n}\nreturn strRet;\n\n} }\n```\n. Ans to Q1: please take a look for Z-Order issue @ BarLineChartBase::onDraw(Canvas canvas)\nAns to Q2: please take a look for circle style @ LineChartRenderer::drawCircles(Canvas c)\nand you may see float halfsize = dataSet.getCircleRadius() / 2f;\nif (dataSet.isDrawCircleHoleEnabled()\n                        && circleColor != mCirclePaintInner.getColor())\n                    c.drawCircle(x, y,\n                            halfsize,\n                            mCirclePaintInner);\n.

Then if i open again, it increases +10mb again, if i close and open again, it increases +10mb .....\nIt does not happen with lineChart, if fragment or acivity gets destroyed, memory is released.\n. @PhilJay  Problem is on mDrawBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(width, height, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444); in PieChartRenderer.java, createBitmap gets MBs of memory(depends on pixels) and it is not released. This guy says he didn't find way to solve this with createBitmap: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8527745/3736955 .

    "MFlisar": "Ok, didn't think about that. Following alternative solution:\nUse a interface in a static class that can be set from outside. Then, one could set this interface with a custom implementation on so could use localised resources. If you don't like this idea, it's ok, but following is my idea, you may think about using it:\n```\npublic class BasicDefinitions\n{\n    public static interface IGraphStrings\n    {\n        public String getDescription();\n        public String getNoDataText();\n    }\nprivate static IGraphStrings mGraphStrings = new IGraphStrings()\n{\n    @Override\n    public String getDescription()\n    {\n        return \"Description\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getNoDataText()\n    {\n        return \"No chart data available.\";\n    }\n};\n\npublic static IGraphStrings getGraphStrings()\n{\n    return mGraphStrings;\n}\n\npublic static void setGraphStrings(IGraphStrings graphStrings)\n{\n    mGraphStrings = graphStrings;\n}\n\n}\n```\nAnd use it for example like the following:\n```\npublic class BaseApp extends Application\n{\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate()\n    {\n        super.onCreate();\n        BasicDefinitions.setGraphStrings(new IGraphStrings()\n        {\n            @Override\n            public String getNoDataText()\n            {\n                return getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.chart_no_data_text);\n            }\n        @Override\n        public String getDescription()\n        {\n            return getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.chart_description);\n        }\n\n    });\n}\n\n}\n```\nOr use custom string fields in the static class instead of the interface with getters/setters for the string, but then you have to set the strings manually in the correct language. But even better than having no option to change the strings\n. Thanks, that worked\n. yes. and show labels as well.\nI experience the same behaviour if I have multiple values and all are 0 only...\n. Here's a screenshot. It uses the same graph, just with different data.\nIn the first graph you see the values. The second graph has three 0 values at exact the same position as the first one... But you can't recognise them because they are not drawn... Probably it has to do something with the y axis bounds?\n\n. Thanks a lot, I will wait and check that\n. I just tested a little bit and I think I found out what exactly is causing the problem. I think, it's combining LineDataSets with at least one LineDataSet that does not have any entries... As soon as I add a LineDataSet that does not have any entry, the graph throws an exception...\nPlease tell me if this info let's you recreate the problem, otherwise I will offer a complete example...\n. And here's my setup\n```\npublic static LineChart createLineChart(Activity activity, LinearLayout llParent, LineChart lineChart, ChartData data, Integer heightInDpForNotEmptyData, Integer heightInDpForEmptyData, boolean forceStartAtZero, boolean showLegend)\n{\n    if (lineChart != null)\n        llParent.removeView(lineChart);\n    lineChart = new LineChart(activity);\nlineChart.setDescription(\"\");\nlineChart.setNoDataText(MainApp.get().getString(R.string.no_data_available));\nlineChart.getPaint(Chart.PAINT_INFO).setColor(Color.RED);\n\nlineChart.setHighlightEnabled(true);\nlineChart.setTouchEnabled(true);\nlineChart.setDragEnabled(true);\nlineChart.setScaleEnabled(true);\nlineChart.setPinchZoom(true);\n\nlineChart.getAxisLeft().setStartAtZero(forceStartAtZero);\nlineChart.getAxisRight().setStartAtZero(forceStartAtZero);\nlineChart.getAxisRight().setDrawLabels(false);\nlineChart.getXAxis().setPosition(XAxis.XAxisPosition.BOTTOM);\n\nlineChart.getAxisLeft().setTextColor(Functions.getDefaultTextColor(activity));\nlineChart.getXAxis().setTextColor(Functions.getDefaultTextColor(activity));\n\nlineChart.setDrawGridBackground(false);\n\nlineChart.animateXY(1000, 1000);\n\nMyMarkerView mv = new MyMarkerView(activity, R.layout.custom_marker_view);\nlineChart.setMarkerView(mv);\n\nif (data != null)\n{\n    lineChart.setData((LineData) data);\n    if (showLegend)\n        lineChart.getLegend().setTextColor(Functions.getDefaultTextColor(activity));\n    else\n        lineChart.getLegend().setEnabled(false);\n}\n\nint h = heightInDpForNotEmptyData != null ? (lineChart.isEmpty() ? (int)Functions.convertDpToPixel(heightInDpForEmptyData, activity) : (int)Functions.convertDpToPixel(heightInDpForNotEmptyData, activity)) : LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT;\nllParent.addView(lineChart, new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, h));\nreturn lineChart;\n\n}\n```\n. And yes, that's exactly what I have...\n. Actually, I thought that empty datasets were shown in the legend, but they weren't. They were anyway ignored. For me, checking for an empty dataset before adding it to the chart solves the problem so far without any difference to version 2.0.8...\n. ",

I will eagerly be waiting for the new release.\nOn Fri, Feb 20, 2015 at 8:13 PM, Philipp Jahoda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nClosed #329 https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/329.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/329#event-239144192.\n. can you kindly say me when new update will be available?.

Yeah, It's working like a charm. But using this beta jar, will it still support all the codes that it have supported before?. I mean you have commented that still pie chart and other charts are still to be done.\n. @PhilJay hey, My project currently have linechart(dual Y-Axis), Piechart, and BarChart. So, Using this beta version is there going to be any bug. Kindly reply soon. I am in a rush. Thanks\n. Can I see your Logcat @raulfdezhdez ??\nIn mine case the problem was due to incompatibility issues and i fixed it as:\n ActionBarSherlock was failing to find a constructor \"a(Activity,int)\" using reflection.\n ProGuard doesn't (can't) know this and has removed the constructor, because it appears unused in the code. You therefore have to explicitly tell ProGuard to keep it:\n\n\n-keepclassmembers class * extends com.actionbarsherlock.ActionBarSherlock {\n    (android.app.Activity, int);\n}\n. Yes you can do it. Just create an array of color template and set it accordingly to your needs along with the data.\n. @kobe82316  I think these are going to be updated in the next version, but i am not sure. if you want it right now you can see hellocharts library and implement the concept of overlay in this library too, by using framelayout one for bar and another for line.\nrefer this link : https://github.com/lecho/hellocharts-android\nif you do have any queries feel free to hit me a mail. \nPlus: if it is not urgent i strongly urge you to wait for next version release. Thanks\n. e. I mean that if i want to keep the grid lines enabled on left Y axis, but i donot want to have the Y-Labels enabled?? ho to achieve this. In short, how can we set the option setDrawYLabels(false)\n. Ok thanks.\n. In second graph, using earlier graph, setting label disabled removes the space as well, but it is not happening in newer versions of library\n. disabling the labels doesnot reduce the gap and i can't find this in wiki bro.\n.

    "drawers": "\nFor that i'm using 2 datasets, one for gain and one for loss\nBut for a point there could be only one value, for example in january i have only a gain and in february i have only a loss.\nIf 2 datasets don't have the same number of values, data are not shown correctly.\n\nCan't you get the effect you want by preprocessing? Work out how many xIndex you need to span both dataSet. If you know which xIndex for January say, 5, you can use gainEntries.add(new Entry(januaryGainValue, 5)) and lossEntries.add(new Entry(feburaryLossValue, 6)). If you have a further Entry in gainEntries at index 7, you will get a line from 5 to 7 with no point/circle at xIndex = 6. If you want to have no line between 5 and 7 you can accomplish this by subclassing LineChartRenderer and overriding drawCubic or drawLinear. See this stackoverflow question\n. The issue was closed and there is currently no support for null values.\nBut, you should be able to extend the library to do this yourself. Depending on what you wanted, you may have to write a custom renderer. There are some examples of this on StackOverflow which are linked from this question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43443787/how-do-mpandroidchart-renderers-work-and-how-do-i-write-a-custom-renderer. Also note Roman Joki's solution at this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/35583641. Thank you everyone for writing about this issue - I was also repro'ing the AIOOB exception for dynamically removing data for v2.2.2. Going to try upgrading to the 3.0.1beta and see if I still get it.\n. I think this has already been covered in another issue (if it is please close this issue) but try mChart.setHardwareAccelerationEnabled(false); to see if it will fix.\n. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25328151/mpandroidchart-with-null-values. Within the library, you can call getTransformer(AxisDependency which) and translate between points on the screen and xIndices and yValues on your chart.. Hi Igor,\nPlease see my answer to your question on StackOverflow:\nIn short, you would need to adapt/implement your own OnChartGestureListener to co-ordinate between the charts.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/41460255/5241933. Sounds like you are struggling with Android programming in general. You need to start by making very simple projects like the ones in the Google developer's guide and moving your way up. When you are confident with Android programming in general, then attempt using a library like MPAndroidChart. \n. You can do this by subclassing XAxisRenderer. There are some examples of custom renderers on StackOverflow. Solved on StackOverflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/43090764/mpandroidchart-how-do-i-remove-gridlines. Answered on StackOverflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/43121992/parcelable-objct-with-another-types-mpandroidchart/43166651. This has already been answered on StackOverflow.

    "PieterAelse": "Works good! Thanks for making this possible :)\nOne issue I'm currently struggling with regarding this is that after I do a clear (chart.clear()) and re-initialize my linedata+set just like before, I end up with a smaller viewport than the current XValuesCount.\nIf I clear when moveViewToX hasn't been called yet (my entryset is smaller than XValuesCount) the clear works as expected and before.\nI tried using moveViewToX(0), fitScreen and setVisibleXRange or a combination of these. (Also setVisibleXRange is the maximum visible X, I'm missing a minimum)\nExamples where I'm displaying the last 10 values of my realtime data and I clear:\n1) if entrySet < 10, clear works fine\n2) if entrySet > 10, thus moveViewToX() is used, I end up seeing X-range from 3-5 till 10, missing the first values in the current viewport (although I can scroll back to 0 ofcourse)\n3) if entrySet > 10 and I clear + use moveViewToX(0) I end up with seeing X-range from 0 to 5-10, sometimes even 0 to 1! Also here I can scroll forward until x=10, but I want to see 0-10 in the starting viewport after clearing.\nMy guess is something extra needs to be reset, since this problem only occurs when moveViewToX is called in the past. \nPlease let me know if any further testing/explaining or a new issue is needed for this!\n. After further investigation I've made a new issue regarding the comment above: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/431 \n. The x-axis gets restrained to (the latest) 10 values.\nI'm not sure if not removing the x-values is the solution because I also want them to be reset from 0 - 32 (eg, see image) to 0-10.\n. Basically the \"expected\" image is exactly what I'm pursuing:\n1) No (y-)values data present in the chart anymore  (chart.clear() or chart.clearValues() )\n2) 0-10 x-values displayed  (so viewport starts at 0)\nCurrently 2) is archieved by adding x-values 0-10 to chart after clear(). But when using clearValues() I think I need to remove x-values > 10. Otherwise I can scroll horizontally beyond x=10, when there is no data available yet.\n. ",

Is there a way to always display the full x axis, even when the number of entries is less than 120 (no scaling effect)?\n. ",

Here's what I did:\nClone MPAndroidChart.\nOpen in Eclipse.\nRight-click on MPChartLib -> Export -> Java  -> JAR File\nCheck 'Export generated class files and resources' and 'Export Java source files and resources'\nFinish\nDownload the latest release.jar of MPAndroidChart\nCopy the missing files and folders from that JAR file to the new JAR file. Do not overwrite anything.\nPut the new JAR file into YourProject/libs/\nSynchronize on Android Studio, right click on your new JAR file and select 'Add as Library'\nIt should work now. \n. Thomas,\nCan you post a snippet of code for this workaround? I'm trying to implement titles in a list of charts in my project.\nEDIT:\nNevermind, got it to work. For anyone having the same issue:\nGo on BarChartItem.java (or whatever sets up your Chart Items) and set the textviews to the holder.\nEx: holder.title= (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.myChartTitle);\nThen set text depending on the position:\nif (position==0){\n            String title = \"Bananas vs Oranges\";\n            holder.title.setText(title);\n        } else if (position ==1) {\n            String title = \"Apples vs Mangoes\";\n            holder.title.setText(title);\n        }\n. Perhaps do a calculation to change the displayed values to what you want? Showing a different value than the passed Y value kind of ruins the point of having a chart.\n. Thanks, your advice helped. Sorry for the confusion!\n. Use these:\nPie chart listener\nBar chart listener\nBasically:\n```\n    mChart.setOnChartValueSelectedListener( new OnChartValueSelectedListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onValueSelected(Entry e, int dataSetIndex, Highlight h) {\n            //fire up event\n        }\n    @Override\n    public void onNothingSelected() {\n\n    }\n});\n\n```\n. Check if you're populating the BarEntry array or BarDataSet array properly. Without any code or knowing what you're data looks like it's kind of hard to tell.\n. ",

The library is not thread-safe.\nMy current workaround is\njava\n        final Entry entry = new Entry(++currentEntries, (float) value);\n        Runnable r = new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                throughputDataSet.addEntry(entry);\n                throughputChart.getLineData().notifyDataChanged();\n                throughputChart.notifyDataSetChanged();\n                throughputChart.invalidate();\n                synchronized (this) {\n                    this.notify();\n                }\n            }\n        };\n        synchronized (r) {\n            runOnUiThread(r);\n            try {\n                r.wait();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n. Then the problem could be how the data is stored and retrieved within MPAndroid. When you see particulary this part of the code then you see that float values and their String representation is stored in two different ArrayList. Maybe these lists diverge and do not have both the same length anymore.\nA fix would be to use a HashMap.\njava\nprivate HashMap<Float, String> cachedValues = new HashMap<>();\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value) {\n  Float boxedValue = new Float(value);\n  String result = cachedValues.get(boxedValue);\n  if(result == null) {\n    result = mFormat.format(boxedValue);\n    cachedValues.put(boxedValue , result);\n  }\n  return result;\n}\nNot an offense but it seems that the whole FormattedStringCache class could be improved. I could write a pull request. Question is if @PhilJay would accept source- and binary incompatible changes (since it is already 3.0.0-beta1) so that all could be refactored into generic classes, or if it would be enough just to change the data structures for all PrimXXX classes.\nFor FormattedStringCache.Generic it says\n\nNOTE: This version relies on auto-boxing of primitive values.  As a result, it has worse memory performance than the Prim versions.\n\nHowever, as you can see I have inserted a direct creation of a Float into PrimFloat because there have been still three occurences in my code where an auto-boxing would have happened.

Since HashMap uses hashCode this could indeed result in Float representing the same value are not regarded the same. However, in that case it would result in values being computed again. This happens when both Float values differ in a small epsilon. The performance would still be better regarding that an ever growing ArrayList results in Array copying due to its implementation.\nAn alternative would require a one to one comparison using an epsilon which is O(n) again.\n.

I can confirm it. This bug does really exist in the latest version of the library.\nBut, @StefanFaulhaber, you can workaround it by generating average values for the missing points. I mean if you have 100 points (List xVals) by XAxis, so you should have 100 points (List yVals) by YAxis. Obviously, this is wrong, but the generation of intermediate values the real way to avoid some of the bugs in the library.\n. I'll try to explain.\nFirst of all you have to understand that XData is List of Strings, because every String represents XAxis label, but not value. However index of String in List represents value. Lets say you have some data, for simplicity, we will take your data about the speed. Obviously, the grid interval for your data is one millisecond. If the total measurement time is 2 h : 15 m : 48 s : 432 ms, that means that you have totally 8148432 ms. And you have to generate XData approximately such way:\njava\nList<String> xVals = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 8148432; i++) {\n    xVals.add(convertMsToHumanReadableTime(i));\n}\nBut if every next measurements happens in time multiple of 5 ms (the first measure is at 0 ms, the second at 10 ms, the third at 15 ms, the fourth at 25 ms, the fifth at 35 ms, etc...), so you can assume grid interval is 5 ms. And next If the total measurement time the same: 8148432 ms. And you have to generate XData approximately such way:\njava\nList<String> xVals = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 8148432; i += 5) {\n    xVals.add(convertMsToHumanReadableTime(i));\n}\nNext you have to generate YData. Entry with index and value fields represents values you want to display on you chart. For you example:\n\nthe first measure is at 0 ms, the second at 10 ms, the third at 15 ms, the fourth at 23 ms, the fifth at 34 ms\n\ngeneration of YData should be something like this:\njava\nList<SpeedMeasurement> speedMeasurements; // your real measurements\nList<Entry> yVals = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (SpeedMeasurement speedMeasurement : speedMeasurements) {\n    yVals.add(new Entry(speedMeasurement.getSpeed(), speedMeasurement.getTime()));\n}\nThus, you generate the timeline and values for it based on your actual data. You can choose any type of chart, but I would advise you to a line chart. It's more actual for your data I think.\nAnd the last one. A large number of data (e. g. 8148432) will greatly affect the performance of chart. I advise you to make an approximation and reduce the amount of data.\n. Hi @forum6691 \nyou can use LineChart.moveViewToX(int index) to move your chart and use LineChart.getLowestVisibleXIndex() to get first visible index\n. ",

I m not home now sorry. But shahzebkhowaja said it. Before when data entries were equals to zero all columns were visible. Now axisX only display 1... And none of my columns are visible. so i would like to know how Can i manage to display them all again?? \n. No... all my columns values are equals to 0 at the begining. And I set my xAxis value to 1,2,3,4,5,6 \nAnd only 1 appears like in the picture\n. ....\n. Hi...\nYou didn't answer my question so i was quite disapointed. But i figured out some things.\nMy leftAxis is filled automaticaly i just say i want 7 Labels with the method setLabelCount(7)\nif i let the leftAxis be filled out automaticaly i get empty barChart like this:\n\nBut if i use leftAxis.setAxisMaxValue(150f) (for exemple)\nI get what i want:\n\nI hope you will understand now what i was asking. And maybe know you can help to do this, but without setting manualy a MaxValue for the leftAxis.\nOn your 1.7.4 Version it was doing it.\nThanks\n. ",

Iterating through the entries & decreasing their xValues seem to solve most problems:\njava\nfor (Entry entry : set.getYVals()) {\n       entry.setXIndex(entry.getXIndex() - 1);\n}\nAs for the drawing exceptions, I had to add a bunch of \n``` java\nList entries = dataSet.getYVals();\nif (entries.size() < 1) {\n       return;\n}\n```\nin LineChartRenderer\nMy experiments are still on-going, some things are still weird (e.g. setVisibleXRange won't work after removing a value)\n. @Blackclaws I had a similar problem, exceptions popped up randomly for things related to buffer.

These are AIOOB exceptions, which means the buffers weren't large enough. They're created at ~ line 57 of LineChartRenderer, and their sizes are correlated to the number of datasets & to the number of entries in the datasets. If such exceptions happen, that's because the number of datasets or the number of entries in the datasets has increased between the time the buffers were created & the time the chart was rendered (so that's probably not because of dynamic removal!).\nNow, what triggers buffer creation? A call to notifyDataSetChanged on LineChart. The drawing methods are called whenever the chart is invalidated (and I guess touching the chart triggers invalidate).\nTherefore, the exceptions happen for one of these reasons: you either forgot to call notifyDataSetChanged after adding a new entry to one of your datasets, or you're calling it too late, after the chart was invalidated (maybe because of a multi-threaded application)!\nIf somehow you can't fix the call to notifyDataSetChanged, you could reinitialize the buffer before each redraw. In BarLineChartBase, at the beginning of onDraw method, you could add \"mRenderer.initBuffers();\". It's a nasty fix, and it's probably bad for performance. But it seems to have fixed my issues.\nNow, this is just a guess on what might cause the issue. I'm not 100% sure it has actually fixed anything, and my application will probably crash right after posting this message just to prove me wrong. But until then, I'm sticking with this fix!\n. Try this:\n```\nprivate static final int VISIBLE_NUM = 5;\nprivate void refreshData(float value) {\n    LineData data = mChart.getData();\n    if (data != null) {\n        LineDataSet set = data.getDataSetByIndex(0);\n    if (set == null) {\n\n        set = new LineDataSet(null, \"DataSet\");\n        set.enableDashedLine(10f, 5f, 0f);\n        set.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n        set.setCircleColor(Color.GREEN);\n        set.setLineWidth(1f);\n        set.setCircleSize(3f);\n        set.setDrawCircleHole(false);\n        set.setValueTextSize(9f);\n        set.setFillAlpha(65);\n        set.setFillColor(Color.BLACK);\n\n        data.addDataSet(set);\n    }\n\n    if(set.getEntryCount() == VISIBLE_NUM) {\n        data.removeXValue(0);\n        set.removeEntry(0);\n\n        for (Entry entry : set.getYVals()) {\n            entry.setXIndex(entry.getXIndex() - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    data.addXValue(new SimpleDateFormat(\"HH:mm:ss\")\n            .format(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis())));\n    data.addEntry(new Entry(value, set.getEntryCount()), 0);\n\n    mChart.notifyDataSetChanged();\n    //mChart.setVisibleXRange(VISIBLE_NUM-1);\n    //mChart.moveViewToX(data.getXValCount() - VISIBLE_NUM);\n    mChart.invalidate();\n}\n\n}\n```\n.

    "dbleicher": "@dowi - I don't have a fix to offer, but perhaps an observation might help.  I was experiencing this same issue when using Daniel Gindi's Swift port (ios-charts) of MPAndroidChart.  I created my chart inside of a cell within a UICollectionView, and created the custom legend with the methods you note above.  When I first run the app, the legend shows entries from the dataset, appearing to ignore my calls to setColors and setLabels.  However, if I scroll the cell off screen, and then scroll it back onto the screen (causing the CollectionView to redraw the cell), my custom legend appears perfectly.  \nSo, at least for me, setColors and setLabels are working, but the chart is not being redrawn after these values are set.  You may want to look into forcing a redraw or relayout (invalidate()?) of your chart after setting your custom legend values.  Also, I believe that setting chart data populates the legend, so I think you'll need to set the custom values AFTER setting the chart's data.  Hope that helps.\n. @dowi  - I've looked through the code as best I can, and either I'm misunderstanding the chart's \"lifecycle\" (order in which key events occur), or I need to make a Feature Request for enhancement to that lifecycle.  Perhaps @PhilJay can shed some light if he gets a chance.  Here's what I think happens:\n1. Chart's view is initialized\n2. User code can create datasets and combine into a ChartData object\n3. If the user sets the Chart's data, the chart is rendered (setting data triggers the render)\n4. If the user doesn't set the Chart's data before returning control, rendering is still triggered but with a \"No chart data available\" message being the only rendered output.\n5. If the user has set data, and later changes that data, notifyDatasetChanged() will cause the underlying data to be recalculated (overwriting custom legend info?) and re-rendered.\nOur first problem is with step 3.  Ideally, there would be a way to set the data, but NOT render the chart (or at least, defer the render).  I can think of two reasons why this would be desirable:  animation (#585) and custom legends (#596).  If we could fully configure the entire chart (data, legend, etc.) before triggering the render, then we could animate the initial chart display (instead of showing the result and then invalidating/animating, would eliminate the \"flash\") and our custom legend would be correct on first viewing.\nStep 5 represents a lesser issue, and only for the custom legend.  I believe that notifyDatasetChanged() will regenerate legend data overwriting any custom colors/labels that have been set.  It would be helpful to be able to call notifyDatasetChanged(), and then reapply custom legend information, before the re-render.\nIf I'm right about the lifecycle, it might be possible to accommodate the change without breaking existing code.  Perhaps we could add an an overload of setData(ChartData data) that accepts a flag to defer rendering like setData(ChartData data, Boolean renderNow), and then add a method on the Chart that just renders (without reevaluating data)?  Just a thought.\n. Thanks @PhilJay, and thank you for this excellent library!  I'll look through the code some more and see if I can figure out something to contribute.\n. @SilverFoxA  - The chart is automatically skipping every other month label to ensure that it can display the full label text for each.  If your chart was wider, you would see all the labels.  There are a couple of ways to fix this, however, and the chart DOES support scrolling.  To have the scrolling and all labels, use:\nmyBarChart.setDragEnabled(true); // on by default\nmyBarChart.setVisibleXRange( 3 ); // sets the viewport to show 3 bars\nInstead of the \"3\", choose whatever value is small enough so that all the month labels appear.  When you run this, the chart can be scrolled to show the additional xValues by touch dragging.\n. @SilverFoxA - Hmmm... works fine for me.  EDIT:  you must setVisibleXRange() AFTER setting the chart's data (https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport).  Can you give that try?  If that doesn't work, can you post your code?\n. @SilverFoxA - glad you got it working.  As for formatting the values, I think you're referring to the yAxis values (rather than a separate legend).  You'll use a ValueFormatter for this as explained in the docs:  https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-ValueFormatter-interface\n. ",

As I have a problem when I have barChart.setDrawValuesForWholeStack(true) enabled and one of the stacks which precedes another one is zero, the values overlap.

I think it would be nice to just supress drawing zeros.\n. Tried this and it also works : ) Well didn't know it can be achieved by this as well,.

So it is now up to you whether you want to keep my changes or not. Cheers!\n. Well true, it also depends on the graph, in some cases (like mine) where '1' is quite a big value, just hiding zeros helps.

    "gjpc": "The problem with sorting the x (or any) axis is that often the order the data is placed into an array is part of the dataset, let's call the order variable time instead of just an index. In a scatter plot tracking wilder beasts the X axis and Y axis are position and the index position of the coordinates is the time that the beast was at the point. The chart should be ready for multiple points where x,y are all equal, this happens when the wilder beast grazes.  And yes, it always take longer to go through more data, but it is a necessary hit with some data sets.\nPerhaps setting a flag in a DataSet object's first scan of the data to let the renderers know it aint so. It may be advisable to just to go ahead and set the flag when realtime data manipulation occurs.\n. As noted above, ordering the data will lose information from some data sets. \nFrom Wikipedia:\nA scatter plot is used when a variable exists that is under the control of the experimenter. If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the control parameter or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or dependent variable is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. If no dependent variable exists, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate only the degree of correlation (not causation) between two variables.\n. To go back to my example, a wilder beast will not only travel north and south over time but it will travel both east and west. The X axis is the east-west position of the animal on ground. if you order the east west data it will not reflect the actual travel of the animal, it will falsely show that the animal moves only in an easterly direction.\n. moving the position of the data point on the x axis loses the time element, the sequence of the plot. I not only removed the two break statements to the scatter plot renderer to make it useful for tracking data, but I also added a flag to display the index as the value not the Y axis value. The index of my data is the relative time the x,y data point was acquired:\n\n. \n. If I ordered my x data point 538 would be to the right of point 535 not to the left as it was in the data\n. Non copiche, Daniel you are only showing the y value there where do I pump in the X value independent of the xIndex? \nI have to already use the xVals array to set the size of the area under study\n. And that X sets the size of the area that is under study, otherwise I can't control the area of the graph.\n. ScatterChartData *data = [[ScatterChartData alloc] initWithXVals:xVals dataSets:dataSets];\nAlso there is only one set of xVals for multiple sets of yVals. In my data the yVals are not dependent on the xVals.\n\u05e7\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05e9\n. LOL, no, I am reading. Where in IOS-Charts do I plot multiple yVals  each associated with its own unique xVals?\n. And sorting that array destroys the Sequence of when the data value was acquired. I am not only plotting Latitude (y) and Longitude (x) I am plotting time, time going in the only direction that time travels.\n. Connect the data points by a line between each successive data point. That series of line segments will look very different for the sorted and unsorted cases.\n. @danielgindi  oh yes, and count on that line enhancement when I have time to add it to the scatter plot.\n@TR4Android yes, you have encapsulated the problem. I'll look into setData Thanks!\n. @TR4Android Copying the array removes the visual information. That is why I modified the ScatterPlotRenderer with an option to display the value of the i index not the Y value. With a flag valueIsIndex. You can see it at work in the plot that I posted above.  Besides the simple NSNumberFormatter  I would like to add \nNSString *ComplexValueFormatter( int index, ChartDataSet *aDataSet )\nto the base chart data set object. It hands over the index and data set so a more comprehensive value may be displayed in the value boxes on the chart; but that would take me some time because I have very little Swift under my belt.\nAlso performance is not much of a problem, my average sized data set renders at blinding speed on my iPad Air, and we bio folks are an unusually patient bunch, sitting around in the weeds all day. And I always set my X axis to be larger than any value in my data set.\n. @danielgindi @TR4Android  pushed the optional scatter lines to my branch https://github.com/gjpc/ios-charts\n. ",

What I meant is that without setViewPortOffsets the intended visual design is not achieved, but the chart appears to function properly.\nBut for the purposes of achieving our design:\nIf I call setViewPortOffsets(0, 0, 0, 0); after setData, I must do postInvalidate() to ensure the correct behavior on small charts.

I am drawing a line chart, with multiple fill colours (i.e. one fill colour for dataset values above a specified limit and another fill colour for values below the limit) by using multiple datasets. IMO it would be an interesting demo to be added in your demo app. Let if know if I should send a pull request for the same :)\n. Yes its almost the same thing except that I am making the datasets with colour filled (so maybe slower rendering than the demo). Also in the demo (DynamicalAddingActivity.java), sometimes the viewport doesn't move to the next value on addition. I am testing it on samsung galaxy tab S, haven't checked on other devices.\nI also wanted to know why isn't the view getting refreshed in the moveViewToX function. As far I could understand in the code, it's being executed in the View.post queue (the MoveViewJob class). So, if the next call to chart.invalidate() is called earlier than the callback of View.post job, then the chart will not be updated.\n. Yes, in a regular activity. Also when the viewport is not moving upon a particular data, if I touch/tap the screen before adding the next data, the viewport moves to the correct position, I guess this is because of invalidate being called on touch (which was not called earlier after the job completed callback)\n.\n.

    "i-schuetz": "It also stops working for me sometimes... I'm using the chart in a fragment.. I have a situation that seems to require similar functionality: I have a real time line chart where some lines usually have their own \"ranges\" along the y-axis. So they have some space between them and rarely overlap. The user can select which line to focus on. For this I set the visible y range to the current min and max of this line, using setAxisMinimum and setAxisMaximim. I also have an option to \"focus all the lines\", for which I simply call setAutoScaleMinMaxEnabled(true). Then the chart resets the y-range and shows all the lines again.\nWorks well, the problem is that when the chart is focused on one line the users want to be able to pan past the boundaries, so they can see other lines, wihout having to set the chart back to \"focus all\" mode, which resets the range of the axis.\nSo basically what I need is:\nWhen a line is focused (i.e. y-axis is constrained to max/min of this line with setAxisMinimum and setAxisMaximim) and user starts panning, stop constraining the range (by not calling  setAxisMinimum and  setAxisMaximum anymore - it's easy to do this using the gesture listener) and simply allow user to pan past the current boundaries. I'm not seeing right now a way to achieve this. It's similar to if chart was zoomed, except that it's not zoomed, in the sense of \"scaled\", but the range of the y-axis modified. I could try to implement the \"focus on line\" functionality using zooming, by calculating the pivot and zoom level needed on each added point to emulate setAxisMinimum and setAxisMaximim, which would allow the user to pan as the chart is only scaled, but this seems a bit painful way to do this and I'm not completely sure yet that it works. I hope there's a better way? Thanks!. To illustrate the problem here is a modified version of RealtimeLineChartActivity in 3.0.2 example where it can be reproduced: https://gist.github.com/i-schuetz/278a52f4e63d5893df20c4ff6f9be70c\nHow to reproduce\n- Zoom chart on x axis\n- \"Pause\" it - by initiating a gesture\n- Ensure loop is still active - there's no visible effect as chart is paused but it still should be adding points.\n- Try to select a point - it will not select the correct point.\nAdjustments I did in the example:\n- Increase number of values in loop to 100000 (for better testability)\n- Add gesture listener to chart to stop moving to last added value when the chart is touched. This is a requirement I have. The chart should stay still and user should be able to tap to see markers and drag. The chart should start moving to last value again when user presses on an external \"play\" button (this button is not in this example, as this part is not necessary to reproduce the issue).\n- setPinchZoom to false so it's possible to zoom x individually.\n.

I had a similar requirement and I solved it by adding circular highlighting. This is how it looks.. @Nfear, depending on which axis is enabled and has the grid lines, you can disable it with the code below. binding.chart.setDrawGridBackground(false); disables the grid background and not the grid lines.\nbinding.chart.getXAxis().setDrawGridLines(false); // disable grid lines for the XAxis\nbinding.chart.getAxisLeft().setDrawGridLines(false); // disable grid lines for the left YAxis\nbinding.chart.getAxisRight().setDrawGridLines(false); // disable grid lines for the right YAxis. If you know the color of each bar, you could specify those colors and set the BarDataSet; since colors are reused as soon as the number of Entries the DataSet represents is higher than the size of the colors array.\nFor example:\n```\n    BarDataSet barDataSet = new BarDataSet(yValues, \"\");\nbarDataSet.setColors(barColors);\n\n```\nwhere barColors is the list of colors to be used by the bar chart's bars.\n. @PreetiR08, yes you can achieve that with this library. You need to specify a list of colors that would be used by your list of X values. So if you have 10 X values, for each value of X, you would populate your list of colors with either a green, a red or whatever color you need. This ensures that the index of the X value in the list of X values matches with the index of the color in the list of colors. And then set the colors on your barDataSet as I indicated above (barDataSet.setColors(barColors);).\n. @tvajjhala include your code.\n. @JainamJhaveri if you remove x.setAvoidFirstLastClipping(true), it should work. However, if you remove it, your x-labels would be clipped off sometimes.\n. @JImmyBhavsar, please include your code.\n. Hi @JImmyBhavsar,\nThe while loops that populates the chart's y values for both data sets look the same to me, apart from float x = Float.parseFloat(da.substring(0,da.lastIndexOf(\".\")));, which is only in the first while loop. I don't see where you use x after computing a value for it. Also, what's the initial value of cnt?\nAlso, both datasets have 2 different YAxis dependencies, can you try setting both of them to the same YAxis dependency to see if you notice any change? \n. Where does the null pointer exception occur?. @120660021 please add more details to this issue so your chances of getting helped are increased.. Specify the android:layout_height or the android:minHeight in dp and it'll work.. @jsmontteiro you would need to use an AxisValueFormatter to display the labels. Take a look at the doc here and this example formatter used here.. @Adeyiwunmi do you have an example image of what you want to achieve? . @borjaruiz did you try specifying the android:layout_height in dp instead of using match_parent or wrap_content for each chart?. @borjaruiz I see you specified the height and width on the <include /> tag. If you remove those height and width specs from the <include /> tag and specify them on the BarChart itself, it would work.. @deshario Have you tried the following?\nlineChart.getXAxis().setPosition(XAxis.XAxisPosition.BOTTOM);. @Malcom100 Could you include the entire setup code you used to generate the chart above and also the chart you expect to generate with the library?. AFAIK, this is not yet available in the library. You can fork the library and add it yourself. Here's a code sample I wrote for circular highlighting; this  was suitable for my use case. Here's how it looks.. @sanuggko do you have an image of what you want to implement with this library?. @deshario Have you tried the following?\nlineChart.getXAxis().setPosition(XAxis.XAxisPosition.BOTTOM);. @deshario since your problem is solved, you can close this issue.. @prengifo https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/How-not-to-contribute. @fabiolanza can you try setting the android:minHeight attribute for the chart and see if that helps?.

I guess this is more of a Feature Request now. E.g. how to draw closed graphs and multiple y values with same x-value.. @abhaymaniyar You are specifically using a Bezier curve fitting to smoothen out your data. When you data is abruptly clipped, the fittet curve will smoothen this out, and produce 'overshoots'. That's just the way it's supposed to be.\nA work-around could be to split your line into different datasets (e.g. X1 = X > k; X2 = X <= k) and only interpolate the part you want. Another approach could be to artificially add a lot of points at the 'edge', forcing the curve to fit close to that part.\nIf you need more specifics, feel free to open the 'issue' on SO and tag me..

    "bogdanzurac": "@PhilJay Cool. But bear in mind that not all implementations use models. In case of the CursorAdapter, how would the system that you are describing work? That's why I was thinking about using the interface pattern on the Adapter, not on individual models.\nIs there by any chance a commit on another branch with this system, where we can take a look at how it works? I'd be interested in checking it out, if it's committed already.\n. Has this been implemented? Is there any docs with details on the usage or whatnot?\n. I guess it gets the job done in cases where you already have a list of items as POJOs and you could extend them from the base DataSet. However, in case of CursorAdapters, this solves nothing. Furthermore, even in the case I mentioned above, if your data model already extends some other model you have, you're stuck. I don't really think this current approach is flexible enough compared to what I explained in the first post. Is there any reasoning as to why you've taken this route instead?\n. I can confirm this behavior.\nNeither are the values of each bar proportional to the total sum of values of the chart (in your case, the first bar with value 3 proportionate to total value 18, so the first bar should be 1/6 of the total height), nor are they proportionate related to each other, with the highest value being the tallest one (in your case 4th bar with value 1 should be 1/3rd of the height of the first bar, since the first one is the highest value, like you mentioned).\nSo something is definitely wrong. I presume the 2nd case I mentioned should be the intended behavior, right?\n. Setting the min value on the Y axis to 0 solved it. I assumed this was the default value. Thanks for clearing that out.\nIs there a reason why you're setting the Y min value to the min value of all the bars - the bottom space?\n. ",

    "desnyki": "I solved this by adding a null check in the LineBuffer.java code. So if buffer is empty for whatever reason, i reinitialize the buffers\nLineBuffer buffer = mLineBuffers[dataSetIndex];\n    //my code \n    //start\n    if(buffer==null) {\n            initBuffers();\n            buffer = mLineBuffers[dataSetIndex];\n        }\n    //end\nbuffer.setPhases(phaseX, phaseY);\n. To use have your chart defined in a global mChart variable. and make sure your x-axis has points defined from your x min to x max (ex. graph from 0 to 5 would have x points 0,1,2,3,4,5).\nExample call\nanimateXYAxis(initialData,finalData,2000);\nThis code only works with a LineChart (you could try and implement different chart compatibility) and has not been thoroughly tested.\nIntended use is to take make a copy of your dataSet and make the changes to the copy. Then pass the initial dataset as start and the copy as final. That s how the spacial change vector is calculated.\n``` java\n  private Handler mHandler = new Handler();\npublic void animateXYAxis(LineDataSet start,LineDataSet end,int duration){\n    float[] dy = new float[start.getEntryCount()];\n    float[] dx = new float[start.getEntryCount()];\n    int iterations = (duration/1000)*30;\n    int iterationDuration = duration/iterations;\n    List<Entry> endVals = end.getYVals();\n    List<Entry> startVals = start.getYVals();\n    for (int i=0;i<dx.length;i++){\n        dx[i]=((float)endVals.get(i).getXIndex()-(float)startVals.get(i).getXIndex())/iterations;\n        dy[i]=(endVals.get(i).getVal()-startVals.get(i).getVal())/iterations;\n    }\n    MyXYAnimation renderAnimation = new MyXYAnimation(iterations,iterationDuration,dx,dy,start);\n    mHandler.post(renderAnimation);\n}\n\npublic class MyXYAnimation implements Runnable {\n\n    private int iterations;\n    private int iterationDuration;\n    float[] dx;\n    float[] dy;\n    LineDataSet setToDisplay;\n    int counter =0;\n    float xOffset[];\n    public MyXYAnimation(int iterations, int iterationDuration, float[] dx, float[] dy, LineDataSet setToDisplay) {\n        this.iterations = iterations;\n        this.iterationDuration = iterationDuration;\n        this.dx = dx;\n        this.dy = dy;\n        this.setToDisplay = setToDisplay;\n        xOffset = new float[dx.length];\n        Arrays.fill(xOffset,0);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run(){\n        for (Entry entry : setToDisplay.getYVals()){\n            xOffset[counter%dx.length] += dx[counter%dx.length];\n            if(xOffset[counter%dx.length]>=1||xOffset[counter%dx.length]<=-1) {\n                entry.setXIndex( (entry.getXIndex() + (int)xOffset[counter%dx.length]));\n                xOffset[counter%dx.length]-=(int)xOffset[counter%dx.length];\n            }\n            entry.setVal((entry.getVal()+dy[counter%dy.length]));\n            counter++;\n        }\n        mChart.invalidate();\n        iterations--;\n        if(iterations>0)\n            mHandler.postDelayed(this,iterationDuration);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n. the animation is kind of a crappy way of displaying a set, and is not to be used with addEntry.\n. You can see my solution here, this work for line charts only, you d have to modify the code for other charts.\n1242\n. > Hi @almic, is this really not going to be implemented? It would a very nice fix to be seen in the library.\n\n@desnyki has posted a fix for linechart a few years ago in issue #1242 , can't this be adapted to barcharts?\n\nYou're right it was years ago when I was less experienced. If you use this solution please use an animation interpolator over handlers. Handler here will cause stutter and memory leaks.. ",

Thanks @JStav.\nIs there anyway to to get this to work?\nMaybe make the 3 points and plot the rest of the them on that line but on a different lineset?\nOr a different Library maybe?\nCan I convert the D3 library and use it with android? Is that possible?\nThanks, I would really need this to work.\nAll The best\n. Ok, so I made a chart for the first 3 points:\n\nAnd your saying that I should plot the rest on a new line with out any color?\nThat should work?\nHow do I plot multiple linesets with one chart?\n. What I am trying to do is get a sun path. As shown below:\n\nThe multiple lines in this graph represents different months of the year.\nI have specific points of the day according to the sun and the times they occur. For example sun rise, sun set and midday (half way between sunrise and sunset) along with other times.\nI thought I can plot them on a graph dividing the time by 24 to get the X and the time by midday (around 12) to get the Y. and then plot them on a graph.\nThese times change every day, however they are all relative to one another.\nMy end goal is to hopefully have something like this: \n\nWhere each of those images are separate days.\nDo you think this is at all possible? \nAm I in way over my head?\nThanks.. hey, Thank you for your help I figured it out. I used the elevation of sun to graph the line and then plotted the points in time on the a different data set, on that graph.\nI was wondering if it is possible to set highlight effect for only a specific data set. thanks\n.

The same few points would highlight and others wouldn't.\nEssentially this is what my Activity looks like:\nOnCreate\n{\nmScatterChart = (ScatterChart) findViewById(R.id.test_scatter_plot);\nmScatterChart.setOnChartGestureListener(new OnChartGestureListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onChartGestureStart(MotionEvent me, ChartTouchListener.ChartGesture     lastPerformedGesture) {\n\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartGestureEnd(MotionEvent me, ChartTouchListener.ChartGesture lastPerformedGesture) {\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartLongPressed(MotionEvent me) {\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartDoubleTapped(MotionEvent me) {\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartSingleTapped(MotionEvent me) {\n            final Entry entry = mScatterChart.getEntryByTouchPoint(me.getX(), me.getY());\n            if(entry != null){\n                final Object data = entry.getData();\n                Log.d(TAG, \"onChartSingleTapped: Touched: \"\n                        + entry.getX() + \", \" + entry.getY());\n            }\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartFling(MotionEvent me1, MotionEvent me2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartScale(MotionEvent me, float scaleX, float scaleY) {\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onChartTranslate(MotionEvent me, float dX, float dY) {\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nThen call an init() method to populate the plot with data:\ninit()\n{\nmScatterChart.setTouchEnabled(true);\nmScatterChart.setScaleEnabled(true);\nmScatterChart.setPinchZoom(true);\nArrayList<Entry> xyValues = new ArrayList<>();\n//add data to xyValues\nScatterDataSet xyScatterDataSet= new ScatterDataSet(xyValues,\"x,y plot\");\nxyScatterDataSet.setHighlightEnabled(true);\nxyScatterDataSet.setDrawHighlightIndicators(true);\nxyScatterDataSet.setDrawValues(false);\n\nArrayList<IScatterDataSet> iScatterDataSets = new ArrayList<>();\niScatterDataSets.add(xyScatterDataSet);\n ScatterData scatterData = new ScatterData(iScatterDataSets);\nmScatterChart.setData(scatterData);\nmScatterChart.getData().setHighlightEnabled(true);\nmScatterChart.invalidate();\n}\n\nIf someone helps me figure this out I will reward them with some cash via PayPal!\nThanks!\n.

    "brcinho": "I am also experiencing the same issue. On my dashboard fragment, I have two pie charts and one bar chart. User is often navigated back to dashboard and in memory profiler in Android studio I see that each time additional three MB get allocated, when I navigate to some other Fragment from it, those MB don't get garbage collected.\nI even put \n```\n@Override\npublic void onStop()\n{\n    if (totalCountChart != null)\n    {\n        pieChartLocations.clearAllJobs();\n        totalCountChart.clearAnimation();\n        totalCountChart.clear();\n        totalCountChart = null;\n    }\n    if (pieChartLocations != null)\n    {\n        pieChartLocations.clearAllJobs();\n        pieChartLocations.clearAnimation();\n        pieChartLocations.clear();\n        pieChartLocations = null;\n    }\n    if (pieChartItems != null)\n    {\n        pieChartLocations.clearAllJobs();\n        pieChartItems.clearAnimation();\n        pieChartItems.clear();\n        pieChartItems = null;\n    }\nsuper.onStop();\nSystem.gc();\n\n}\n```\nin my dashboard fragment, but it doesn't help.\nLater I traced that in your DataRenderers you have bitmap fields and somewhere in between version 2.1.4 and version 2.1.6 the new method\n/**\n     * Releases the drawing bitmap. This should be called when {@link   LineChart#onDetachedFromWindow()}.\n   */\n    public void releaseBitmap() {\n        if (mDrawBitmap != null) {\n             mDrawBitmap.recycle();\n             mDrawBitmap = null;\n        }\n   }\nwas introduced in but I don't think it gets called anywhere, maybe I am wrong.\nThe problem is that I see that Bitmap.createBitmap in memory tracer takes those around three MB, and I think that the releaseBitmap should be called somewhere in chart.clear() method\nP.S. why the hack so many clear methods, shouldn't one public call all of them :smile: \nP.S.2 it is big memory leak, so I think the instructions for clearing the chart/releasing memory should go in your main readme file.\n. In my case 2.1.6\n. The releaseBitmap() method only gets called in onDetachedFromWindow() and I don't see where and when is that method invoked. On the other hand, onDetachedFromWindow() is defined only in LineChart and PieChart, what about other types of charts? \n. In issue #1197 i think I explained the potential root of the problem, but I don't know how it got ignored for such a long time.\n. You are absolutely right. I went out of line there and therefore I apologize. If you need help and want me to jump in with trying to fix it and submitting a pull request, let me know.\n. Submitted a pull request, it is my first :smile: so if I did something wrong let me know.\nAs I wrote in the comment, I don't know which code change contributed more, whether settings canvas and its reference to bitmap to null or pinging system to perform garbage collection.\nI don't know also if calling gc() is a bad thing and can do something wrong. As I understood, it is an instruction to jvm that gc() should be performed, and not an explicit call to garbage collection, so maybe it really can not do any harm. Your call.\nResults can be observed here performed by manual testing by opening and closing Line Chart (or Pie Chart) form in example app around 50 times as fast as possible:\nBefore changes: Version before changes: compile 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v2.2.4'\n\nAfter changes:\n\n.

It might also be worthwhile to replace other Strings by CharSequence (e.g. for setDescription(), names in datasets and x-values, &c).\n. @PhilJay The problem seems to be related to drawing values that are very small when compared to the total (i.e. an angle of the pie that measures to less than one degree). An in particular, it seems to be caused by this condition in PieRenderer.drawDataSet():\nif (sweepAngleOuter % 360f <= Utils.FLOAT_EPSILON) {\n        // Android is doing \"mod 360\"\n        mPathBuffer.addCircle(center.x, center.y, radius, Path.Direction.CW);\nBy changing this code so that it never goes inside this branch (i.e. if (false) { ...) then the pie is drawn correctly. Problem is, I didn't really understand the purpose of that check, so I'm not sure about the consequences of changing it. :(\nHow to reproduce\nIn the sample's PieChartActivity, alter the setData() method by commenting out the part that generates the entry values and replacing it by this code:\n```\n    /\n    for (int i = 0; i < count ; i++) {\n        entries.add(new PieEntry((float) ((Math.random() * mult) + mult / 5), mParties[i % mParties.length]));\n    }\n    /\nentries.add(new PieEntry(197, \"A\"));\nentries.add(new PieEntry(1344, \"B\"));\nentries.add(new PieEntry(314, \"C\"));\nentries.add(new PieEntry(3, \"D\"));\n\n```\nYou will see that the whole pie is covered by the color of the last entry (the smallest one). Some other artifacts may be present too, depending on the order of the entries.\nTested on 3.0.0 release.\n. @bharatnadkarni Indeed.

If anything, shouldn't the limit be documented somewhere?\nI'll give you some context so hopefully you can understand my situation better. I'm using a HorizontalBarChart to display values for user-created projects during a preset time period (e.g., the current month). A user could have 0 projects or 1,000,000,000 projects, or any number in between. If I set the chart height to be constant, an increase in the number of projects (i.e., data values) causes the bars to become too thin, resulting in the labels on the vertical axis and the data values on each bar to become illegible.\nTherefore the thickness of each bar needs to remain constant, in which case I need to set the height of the chart dynamically based on the number of projects (i.e., data values). More projects results in a taller chart.\n. ",

    "vicmns": "Finally I was able to do what I asked for. I had to make a couple of changes to the following classes/interfaces: \n- IDataSet\n- Highlight\n- ChartHighlighter\n- DataSet\n- ChartData\nBasically, the problem is that Bubble/Scatter chart allows to have multiple data items per X-Index in a single DataSet. So I added a couple of new methods that check for the nearest item to select using both x and y touch points.\nI will do the pull request, in case that is useful for anybody else.\n. I think @helenaccount tries to say is that, on a horizontal bar chart, when te values are negative, the rendering of the bar must be to the right of the Y-Axis and the label rendering must be on the right. And the oposite way on a positive value?\n. Perfect! Now is working, thanks @PhilJay \n. Ok finally I was able to do what I wanted. Before I added my logic to get the new text size given by my custom XAxisValueFormatter, my charts were looking like this:\n\n\nAnd this is the way they look after adding my custom Interface:\n\n\n\nI'm closing this Issue for now.\n. Yikes, my bad, just changed to Entry, but I still have the same problem. I'm not able to reproduce it outside my dataset... But using the following count and range when creating the PieChartActivity setData(150, 5000000); I found out another bug, which makes the chart to render like this:\n\n. Ok I found out why the pie chart was plotting like that. After I do an upstream merge on my fork (which includes the last commits on the pie chart) the chart is now rendering like the demo application that I mentioned previously.\n. Well not exactly, the chart renders like this:\n\nFor a strange reasons the background paints itself, the background of the chart is set to be white...\nThis can be reproduce on the PieChartActivity changing the setData(3, 100) line on onCreate()  to setData(150, 5000000)\n. Finally I was able to reproduce the problem... I created a demo application using the large data set that I mentioned. From time to time the application hangs, sometimes at activity start, other times at activity stop.\nI also was able to pinpoint the problem. It's something related to the toolbar... Inside the demo application can be found two layouts for the DetailActivity, the only difference is that in one the Toolbar is Wrapped on a AppBarLayout while in the other not, using the second one will make the application hangs.\nHeres the link to the demo project: Github Repo\n. Yeah I know! I'm pretty sure there's a bottleneck somewhere on the View Layer implementation that arise particularly on this case... Which is Kind of hard to think, since it should be the opposite case given that we have another extra ViewGroup to render...\nAnyhow I'll try to open a bug report on the Android Source project, hoping that real problem can be found.\n. NVM, I think it's better to actually use a custom XAxisRenderer and set that renderer to my chart.\nSince that way I can know which label is the largest beforehand doing the getLongestLabel logic.\nI can close this down.\nCheers!. ",
    "fraklo": "Am I correct in thinking that the ValueFormatter applies to an entire set of values?\nWhat I want to do is create a custom label for only a few values. This is for a charting activity. That is, the user is entering data and when a particular action is chosen I need to set a data point with a custom label. Imagine the following:\n// Labeled \"4\"\n0,4\n// Labeled \"33\"\n19, 33\n// Labeled: \"Start\"\n20, 35\n// Labeled: \"49\"\n25, 49\n// Labeled: \"Marker 1\"\n26, 50\n// Labeled: \"End\"\n40, 51\nI thought maybe I could get around this by setting a high value for Y and then using the formatter to correct this. Knowing that there will never be a Y value greater than 1000, I can do something like Entry(3, 9048). Then use formatter to parse this high value and determine an appropriate label for it. So with 9048, 9000 could point to a specific label code (let's say \"Start\") to set and that would leave 48 as being the true Y value. \nHowever, from what I can tell, there is no way to intercept the Y value from being submitted. That is, there is no abstraction from the Y axis point and it's label. So in my example, I would end up with a data point at X=3 and Y=9048.\nI could of course just be very dense and missing something. Sorry if this is the case.\n. ",

Any news? I have no workarounds or solutions...\n. ",
    "Noires": "I had the same issue as you, so maybe my solution can help you out here. The only difference might be that i used the MPChart component for Xamarin. \nI had to move the following lines, so that they would be executed over the UIThread via RunOnUiThread() in C#. So basically everything in the thread for addEntry() should only affect the data and not the component itself.\nmChart.NotifyDataSetChanged();\n// limit the number of visible entries\nmChart.SetVisibleXRangeMaximum(120);\n//set.SetDrawCircles(false);\nmChart.MoveViewToX(data.XValCount - 121);\nSo hopefully that gives you the right hint to solve the issue for you.\n. LineDataSet.SetDrawValues(false); should be more appropriated, i guess.\nBut both should work~\n. Where do you call these methods? Is it in a seperate thread or the main thread?\nA little more background information to your problem would be nice.\n. Just a rough guess here, but maybe because your entries for your BarDataSet are empty? Or atleast it seems so, when i just look at that code snippet.\n. Most of the Set and Get Methods got replaced with Properties in the Xamarin Port. So you just have to use lineChart.Data and it should work without a problem.\n. Maybe iam understanding you wrong, but shouldnt be stuff like ...\nBarData barData = new BarData();\n            barData.SetValueTextSize(9f);\nor\nLineDataSet lineDataSet = new LineDataSet(null, \"\");\n            lineDataSet.SetValueTextSize(9f);\n...doing the trick?\n. You could overwrite the ChartClass(LineChart as a Example), overwrite the AxisRenderer you want to change(XAxisRenderer as a Example) and exchange it in your ChartClass with the normal one. Then adjust it to your needs, which is a little bit work. But should work by roughly looking over the classes.\nBut to my knowledge it is not directly implemented yet.\n. This is not related to MPAndroidChart, your issue is connected to Realm.io and your Schema.\nNext time if you ask a question, give more informations about your problem and check carefully what is the real reason behind.\n. There are some tutorials out there who are doing it step by step, though they are prolly outdated with the 3.0 release.\nSo prolly just take a look at all the examples, which should help alot: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/tree/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample\n. It seemed to me that the Combined Chart allowed multiple Y-Axis for different chart data, but not multiple Y-Axis only for LineData? Or am i wrong there?\n. The problem is that in the LineChart the Left-Axis gets scaled to the highest value of the graphs. But i kinda hoped to have multiple Left-Axis for each graph, so that everything gets scaled how it is required.\nBut i think i will just scale the values manually now to one unified range before adding them to the chart and exchange the value formatter depending on which graph is focused.\nStill thanks though!\n. Actually it seems to be related to #1550 .\nThe negated -y was still inside BarLineChartBase:\n```\n    /\n     * Zooms in or out by the given scale factor. x and y are the coordinates\n     * (in pixels) of the zoom center.\n     \n     * @param scaleX if < 1f --> zoom out, if > 1f --> zoom in\n     * @param scaleY if < 1f --> zoom out, if > 1f --> zoom in\n     * @param x\n     * @param y\n     /\n    public void zoom(float scaleX, float scaleY, float x, float y) {\n        Matrix save = mZoomMatrixBuffer;\n        mViewPortHandler.zoom(scaleX, scaleY, x, -y, save);\n        mViewPortHandler.refresh(save, this, false);\n    // Range might have changed, which means that Y-axis labels\n    // could have changed in size, affecting Y-axis size.\n    // So we need to recalculate offsets.\n    calculateOffsets();\n    postInvalidate();\n}\n\n```\nAfter removing the negation, it works normally. Is there a reason for this?. ",
    "cuddle-puneet": "Showing it as a separate dataset leads to a new entry in Legend at the bottom and a new label gets added.\n. Was an issue with the ValueFormatter set for the axis.\n. This issue happens especially if all the BarEntry objects within a BarDataSet contain float[] but just single value within those float[].

Seems to be an issue atm where the values wont be displayed unless there's at least one 0.0 value within your barEntries: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/2452. Spent a bit of time looking into this, I've now got it working where the labels are being drawn using the settings shown below.

The code I added to get it to work for my app is shown below.\nbarChart.getAxisLeft().setDrawAxisLine(true);\nbarChart.getAxisLeft().setDrawGridLines(true);\nbarChart.getAxisLeft().setAxisMinimum(0f);\nI did take a look into the library example app and got it to stop plotting the value labels using similar settings to what I had previously in my own application. I discovered that the library would commonly have issues when dealing with a smaller amount of bars (9 or below) although if I set a break point and debugged the app, it'd add the label values fine.\npublic void drawValues(Canvas c)\nLine 144 of HorizontalBarChartRenderer.java was being called, however there was something within that method going wrong because I noticed the method below wasn't being called on line 320.\nprotected void drawValue(Canvas c, String valueText, float x, float y, int color)\nHopefully this information will help the people who work on this library identify a solution to this problem..

    "vit001": "See issue 1539 for bugfix. \n. Thank you for the fix. It is an improvement but it does not fully resolve the problem. The remaining issue happens when the X zoom limit is hit before the Y zoom limit (or vice versa). In that case pinch-zoom will still happen, scale clipping of X will happen, and translation will get corrupted.\n. Also, this issue still persists when calling BarLineChartBase.zoom( float scaleX, float scaleY, float x, float y ), or BarLineChartBase.zoomAndCenterAnimated( float scaleX, float scaleY, float xValue, float yValue, AxisDependency axis, long duration ). Maybe the best way to handle this is to adjust the translation properly in ViewPortHandler.limitTransAndScale( Matrix matrix, RectF content )?\n. It is not clear to me what bug in MPAndroidLib you are reporting here.\n. Why would you be saving images of the chart every 5 seconds? What's the point? Or what images are you refering to ??\n. > I am assuming that the chart is an actual image on the client's device.\nYou are incorrect on this point. The chart is only rendered on the screen and no image is being saved on the device, unless you explicitly save it yourself.\n. Why don't you use proguard to take care of that?\n. You were asking about compiling a small size package, presumably for distribution. If you use instant run for debugging, why does the method count matter to you?\n. OK, then I suggest you review your proguard configuration. In particular, if you added this:\n-keep public class com.github.mikephil.** {\n     public protected *;\n}\nthen of course, your method count won't change. I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish, but I am pretty sure it doesn't belong under MPAndroidChart issues.\n. In your onChartScale callback, why don't you retrieve the scale/scroll as:\nfloat scaleX = chart.getScaleX();\nfloat scaleY = chart.getScaleY();\nfloat xValue = chart.getViewPortHandler().getContentCenter().x;\nfloat yValue = chart.getViewPortHandler().getContentCenter().y;\nand then set the scale/scroll on your other charts using:\notherchart.getViewPortHandler().setZoom( scaleX, scaleY, xValue, yValue );\nBut seriously, this sort of question belongs to stackoverflow and not here.\n. The suggested change produces the correct result. The existing code does not, for intervals less than 1. Take, for example an interval of 0.06. The correctly adjusted interval should be 0.1. \nGoing through the existing code, interval magnitude is 0.1, instead of 0.01. The problem here is that for negative values, (int) always rounds towards negative infinity, while floor rounds towards zero. \nNext, intervalSigDigit is zero, instead of 6. (Note my Math.round correctly handles floating point numbers like 5.99999999, where the (int) does not (it would produce intervalSigDigit=5 instead of the correct 6)\nLast, you just want interval = 10 * intervalMagnitude;, taking the floor will always result in an interval of zero for intervalMagnitude <0.01.\n. If my comment is not clear, I suggest just feeding an interval of 0.06 to your code and see for yourself. \n. Looking at your commit, it only fixes one out of the 3 bugs I reported here. Please fix the other two as well. Thank you.\n. I don't see why not, you can write a YAxisRenderer to draw whatever you want.\n. A possible solution is to adjust the clip rectangle when rendering the grid lines, to not allow the grid lines to be drawn over an axis:\n```\n        int clipRestoreCount = canvas.save();\n        RectF contentRect = mViewPortHandler.getContentRect();\n        // Adjust the contentrect so the grid lines won't draw over an axis line\n        contentRect.left   += 1;\n        contentRect.bottom -= 2;\n        canvas.clipRect( contentRect );\n    mXAxisRenderer.renderGridLines( canvas );\n    mAxisRendererLeft.renderGridLines( canvas );\n    mAxisRendererRight.renderGridLines( canvas );\n\n    // if highlighting is enabled\n    if ( valuesToHighlight() )\n        mRenderer.drawHighlighted( canvas, mWhatToHighlight );\n\n    // Restore the content rect\n    contentRect.left   -= 1;\n    contentRect.bottom += 2;\n\n    // Removes clipping rectangle\n    canvas.restoreToCount( clipRestoreCount );\n\n```\n. There is no scenario I can think of where the current behavior is preferable. \n. I submitted this bug earlier, with a detailed bugfix, in Issue #1607. Unfortunately, the issue was closed and the fix not applied.\n. The problem appears if you don't setGranurality. You cannot setGranurality if you allow y zoom. \n. Sorry, maybe I don't understand the feature. Why do I have to set the\ngranularity at all? Why can't it be calculated automatically?\nOn Apr 9, 2016 10:52 AM, \"Philipp Jahoda\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSure you can set granularity if you allow y-zoom. That's the whole purpose\nof the feature.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/issues/1666#issuecomment-207822473\n. OK. The default behavior when not setting any granularity, should still produce a correct chart though. As is, it does not. If you apply the fix I suggested in #1607.this bug will go away.\n. Unrelated but a request to the devs: please make the argument to setDescription and similar methods a CharSequence not String. I have Spans I need to use in texts. \n. It's not clear what you mean by \"fragment that is not active\". A fragment can be hidden or destroyed. if it is hidden, and subsequently shown, onResume won't get called. If it is destroyed and then re-created, both onCreate and onResume will be called. Either way, you would not be updating/setting data in onResume. \n. What do you mean by 'crashes'? Pls post the stacktrace\n. You need to read the Android documentation for Fragment lifecycle, FragmentManager and FragmentTransitions. It seems you are destroying your fragment when it goes off screen. Then you of course can't change anything in it. Your question has nothing to do with this library. I suggest you get your app working first by updating a simple textview when your fragment is hidden and take the chart out of the picture. \n. This is a bug which has been around for a long time and for some reason and devs refuse to fix it. See #1607.\n. Yes, download the source and fix it. That's what I did. \n. Without any more information from you, I have absolutely no clue.\n. \n",

Hey @PhilJay from my experience working with this library, I've found that this issue is due to xIndexField \"id\"  in my case. \nRealmBarDataSet barDataSet = new RealmBarDataSet(results, \"Purchase_order\", \"id\");\nIf suppose I select 01-03-2016 date then it's id is 0 so it will show all bars. But if I select 03-03-2016 date then it skips two bars as id of this record is 2. Hence it skips records which have ids 0 and 1. So it skips two bars. So xIndexField has problem here. xIndexField must be like if id of first record(result) is 1 then bars must start from id 1. Instead of this, in this case its starting from 0 and hence bars are missing. \n. hey @PhilJay if you have any suggestions please reply me immediately because I am using this library in my project which I have to finish soon. So little help would be great.\n. Hey I've figured out solution. I just injected a for loop with int i which will be id of bars.

Thanks,  I spent a few hours extracting just the required components from your RealmDatabaseActivityLine and worked through the io. integration tutorial along with some content from Realm docs.\nI've attached a graphing project I constructing to test Realm / MPChart integration for my development project.   if you have a moment unzip it and I think you'll see what I'm trying to do.\nI have your code working as RealmDatabaseActivityLine in package working_sample you can switch to it through a one line change in the manifest to get back to how you made things work.\nIn my attempt ( mostly copy) as RealmPlotTestActivity I've added a listener to add datapoints and see the plot update.  \nMy real problem is how do I implement the my actual Realm Database called DataEntry into this Test Activity \n  ( DataEntry is in database package ).\nDataEntry has x,y,z,data with timestamps.  My other code will be loading values into this database in another thread.   I want a database changed event in my ui thread to update the graph plotting \nx vs, t,  y vs t, z vs t.  \nMy DataEntry database will be limited to a fixed number of points and after filling will operate with removing the first and adding the last keeping a set size for plotting etc..  I'm also not sure how this might affect indexing methods.  My previous code used a singleton of LinkedList datapoints which worked nicely but I'm trying to go Realm now for the multi-threading application.\nI think I'm close, I just can't figure out how to get the data out of my database and into a format that MPChart likes.  Thanks for taking a look.  Love MPChartLib !!! takes me back to 1982 when I had Kodak buy me a fortran library for graphing so I could show data spatially.  Still plotting after all these years.\nPlotRealmTest.zip\n. Ok, I got it.  Creating a new constructor for RealmDemoData2 so that I can reference x,y,z,and t independently I can create RealmLineDataSet objects based uniquely as x,y,z values.  t is left out but stored in the database in case calculations are required,  Thus plots all assume a consistent delta t between points on the x axis.  \nThe code below now works for multiline plots from a single Realm database that contains x,y,z,t data.  Now I just need to make it a dynamic set of a fixed number of points.\n`    private void setData2() {\n```\n    RealmResults result = mRealm.allObjects(RealmDemoData2.class);\nRealmLineDataSet<RealmDemoData2> set = new RealmLineDataSet<RealmDemoData2>(result, \"x\", \"xIndex\");\nset.setDrawCubic(false);\nset.setLabel(\"Realm X\");\nset.setDrawCircleHole(false);\nset.setColor(ColorTemplate.rgb(\"#FF5722\"));\nset.setCircleColor(ColorTemplate.rgb(\"#FF5722\"));\nset.setLineWidth(1.8f);\nset.setCircleSize(3.6f);\n\nRealmLineDataSet<RealmDemoData2> set1 = new RealmLineDataSet<RealmDemoData2>(result, \"y\", \"xIndex\");\nset.setDrawCubic(false);\nset.setLabel(\"Realm Y\");\nset.setDrawCircleHole(false);\nset.setColor(ColorTemplate.rgb(\"#FF5722\"));\nset.setCircleColor(ColorTemplate.rgb(\"#FF5722\"));\nset.setLineWidth(1.8f);\nset.setCircleSize(3.6f);\n\nRealmLineDataSet<RealmDemoData2> set2 = new RealmLineDataSet<RealmDemoData2>(result, \"z\", \"xIndex\");\nset.setDrawCubic(false);\nset.setLabel(\"Realm Z\");\nset.setDrawCircleHole(false);\nset.setColor(ColorTemplate.rgb(\"#FF5722\"));\nset.setCircleColor(ColorTemplate.rgb(\"#FF5722\"));\nset.setLineWidth(1.8f);\nset.setCircleSize(3.6f);\n\nArrayList<ILineDataSet> dataSets = new ArrayList<ILineDataSet>();\ndataSets.add(set);\n dataSets.add(set1);\n dataSets.add(set2);// add the dataset\n\n// create a data object with the dataset list\nRealmLineData data = new RealmLineData(result, \"xValue\", dataSets);\nstyleData2(data);\n\n// set data\nmChart.setData(data);\nmChart.invalidate();`\n\n```\n.

    "zorroblue": "@surfer190 @LeBronoMars The issue can be closed right?\n. @jenhani-ameni  I too got a similar error before. I think what @Noires says is right. Your dataset might be empty because the for loop never ran.\n. Hi @jamesbang ! Could you share your code snippet so that your problem could be better understood?\n. Can you elaborate further on this? Do you want the axis to be boldened or something else?\n. No, that didn't help. I even tried upgrading to Android 2.1.1 . Now it gives me an option to upgrade to Gradle 2.10 , which I click and still pops the same message after 2 minutes of build time. :(\n. At present , we have HighlightLines which can highlight the x-value when we touch the chart at that x point. I want to extend it further by using a line slider underneath, which is not yet implemented in the library( according to my knowledge, I would be glad if you corrected me here). I tried using a seekbar and measuring the x-coordinate of  the thumb. But I don't find a way to put a highlight line at an \"absolute coordinate\" rather than an x-value\n. Yes. I want the line to be at the closest x value to the slider's thumb which is movable.\n. I did that. But that isn't exactly what I need because I need a line slider under the graph. I made a seekbar and got its thumb's coordinate. But I don't see a way to highlight at a coordinate.\n. Hi @PhilJay , I tried what you suggested. It was matching my requirement but the problem is that the Highlight line isn't moving as expected at times. I built upon your PerformanceLineChart.java . I modified the onProgressChanged() mainly\n`  @Override\n    public void onProgressChanged(SeekBar seekBar, int progress, boolean fromUser) {\n```\n    int count = mSeekBarValues.getProgress() + 1000;\n    mTvCount.setText(\"\" + count);\n// mChart.resetTracking();\n    Rect pos=mSeekBarValues.getThumb().getBounds();\n    float position= ((float)pos.left+pos.right)/2;\n    float positionY=(float)(pos.top+pos.bottom)/2;\n    Highlight highlight=mChart.getHighlightByTouchPoint(position,0);\nmChart.highlightValue(highlight);\nmChart.setHighlightPerDragEnabled(true);\nLog.d(\"DEBUG123\",new Float(pos.left).toString()+\" \"+new Float(pos.right).toString());\nsetData(count, 500f);\nline.setEnabled(true);\nline.setBackgroundColor(Color.GREEN);\nline.setMinimumWidth(10);\n// redraw\nmChart.invalidate();\n\n}\n```\n`\nHere is the screenshot: \n\nCan you tell me where I am going wrong?\n. @monxalo It is a really good feature.

    "tonypatino-monoclesociety": "No worries about the schedule, Phil.  I've been considering various ways to up the performance in the library, and they aren't all fully tested yet, but I'd be happy to create a pull request with my findings so far.    The largest gain I found was related to #1897 which there's a pull request for.  \nThe biggest hurdle at this moment is the amount of work performed on the UI thread.  Since much of the calculation is done inside of onDraw instead of pre-calculated in a worker thread, things can look a little stuttery from time to time.  \nAnother option might be to give users an option to set a desired framerate, such as mChart.getRenderer().setDesiredFramerate(int).  If we know that some charts will require so much processing that they can't reach a solid 60fps then perhaps we can offer users the ability to request a refresh rate of 30fps.  While less detailed, a more consistent framerate usually looks a bit better overall.\n. allocationsComparison_2016.06.24.zip\nAbove, I've attached memory usage comparisons on a Nexus 6 across the master branch, and across the feature branch.

It involves generating smaller paths iteratively until all paths are drawn.  Would you like to incorporate this after v3.0.0 is out?\n. Results - Stress testing Activity 1 with 1500 items, full color fill.\n\nResults - Stress testing Activity 2 with 1500 items and full color fill.\n\n. Cool, I'll incorporate this into the performance-related pull request.\n. Pull request #1908\nAttached to issue #1892\nAddresses this issue as well.\n. Pull request #1908 would make this redundant, as all changes in this pull request are present there as well.\n. Sure thing, I'll pull that branch today.  If it's not done today I'll have to resume the merge on Monday next week.\n. @PhilJay Do you have strong feelings about PointF vs PointD?  PointF can't extend Poolable and would need a wrapper of some sort, which would lead right back to PointD.\n. @FabianTerhorst Thanks for the input.  Could you post some memory consumption and performance figures for the master branch vs the feature branch to verify whether the old implementation is faster or more memory efficient, perhaps with a different device than mine?  I had a Nexus 6 available for testing.  My measurements show a sharp drop in worst-case frame rendering of up to 40% now.  \nIt would be easy enough to extract the array length check in any case.\n. @PhilJay See the new pull request : https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/1920\nThe new axis renderer in remove_xindeces presents an issue that prevents caching the labels in the same manner we could in v2.  I would recommend considering a way to associate the formatted strings with specific Entry objects and retrieve the label based on Entry rather than on X/Y position on the Axis.  \nI think that change should probably be its own separate issue in the issue tracker rather than part of this one.\n. Since remove_xindeces will be merged into Master soon, this pull will be somewhat redundant (various classes no longer exist in remove_xindeces, for example).\n. Agreed that extracting the array size offers only a small benefit.  I wouldn't go out of my way to do it in the future, at least on Android, but the results of traditional loop vs foreach are indeed what I expected and what I've measured.  \nForeach has the added problem of implicitly instantiating a new Object for each iteration of the loop, which runs up the amount of garbage quickly when animating the charts, or adding new values.  \nHonestly, the biggest issue left for me to tackle in the proposed v3.0.0 release is how to port the ValueFormatter from this pull request into the remove_xindeces branch.  In v2 it was much easier to cache the Axis labels, but the changes in v3 make that a much bigger problem.  Storing array length outside a loop declaration is small potatoes compared to being unable to cache the results of formatted Strings, when looking at the amount of garbage the String formatting generates.\n. @PhilJay Got the ValueFormatter caching done.  The allocations on the v3 remove_xindeces branch are now down even lower than they were in this pull request for v2 master.  I'll keep an eye out for your updates and make a pull request based off my v3 fork.\nScreenshot of the allocations in my fork tony/remove_xindeces\n0.39MB for 1000 iterations, 0 GC runs, no danger of one in the near future\n\nvs the current main remove_xindeces\n4.8MB for 1000 iterations, 1 GC run with another impending quickly\n\n. I have a unit test for the FormattedStringCache classes, as well as the ObjectPool class.  All existing unit tests continue to pass.  Nothing in the rendered charts looks wrong so far.\nThis change set will require a pull request on the Realm repo as well, since I added a method int getCircleColorCount() to the ILineDataSet interface.  One of the Realm classes needs to implement the method as well.\n. After replacing a few other [] allocations with List<> to [] copying, and hunting down a few other pooling opportunities --\n_0.15MB Allocated memory over 1000 iterations of the Realtime chart, with only 2200 total invocations_\n\n. The gfxinfo shows that all total, it helps reduce the worst-case render times by up to 40%.  Also, these changes make GC runs extremely infrequent which prevents garbage-related hiccups.  \nI think that the next step would be to move all the bitmap rendering off the UI thread.  Drawing the charts is still a fairly expensive operation, and if it can happen outside of onDraw this should theoretically help.  There could be a double-buffered bitmap drawing scheme, such that onDraw will render Bitmap A, while the worker thread draws into Bitmap B.  Only once the worker is done, does Bitmap B get copied to Bitmap A.  \nAlso, it could be good to offer users a desired framerate.  Like, if they only want 30fps then only try to invalidate the display list every 33ms.\n. @PhilJay the new v3 presents an interesting problem when considering caching formatted String values along the XAxis. Previously we were able to cache these values by associating the string with the specific Entry index in the DataSet, and only re-create the formatted text if the Entry value changed.\nSince the new library doesn't do this, and all it tracks is the relative position of the label on the axis, we're forced to constantly re-create format strings in DefaultAxisValueFormatter as the axis changes in the Realtime sample.\nThe library should find a way to uniquely identify which entry an axis value is associated with so that the strings can be cached regardless of the X/Y position of the label along the Axis at render time.\n. Updated the request.  It appears files were missing.\n. Closing due to conflicts.  Will resolve them.\n. I'll wait until this is resolved before making a pull request with the performance updates, since part of my changes involved the now-deleted Realm java classes.\n. Sounds good.  v3.0.0 post-release might be less of a moving target as well, and I'll have some time to check for more allocation hotspots in the meantime.\n. comparison.zip\nThe two allocation charts show the app running at its default 500 allocation example.  Format string caching is a significant part of the memory allocation difference in these readings.  \nThe master branch incurred one GC run before the end of the 500 entries, and was near to incurring a second.  At 5000 entries, master incurred garbage collection about 15 times.  \nThe merged feature branch allocates a fraction of the memory.  Even at 5000 entries, it was not remotely close to incurring garbage collection.\nThe results from gfx info indicate that after all the changes the worst case screen rendering times improve between 25%-40%.  The rendering time per frame is much more consistent with these updates.  GC hiccups account for some of this difference.  The rest is accounted for by caching the the drawn circles inside the LineChartRenderer, which ends up far less expensive computationally than re-drawing all the circles during each onDraw() call.\nAs it stands, the end user neglecting to recycle an FSize or MPPointF doesn't result in issues beyond the original issue of wasted memory.\n. Caching the formatted string results prevents the application from calling\nthe mFormat.format() method repeatedly, to re-create formatted strings that\nit has done the work to format once already.  The original code even\nspecifically calls DefaultAxisValueFormatter.getFormattedValue out as a\nhotspot in the comments, indicating that memory allocation related to\n.format() in the java codebase was a known issue\n// avoid memory allocations here (for performance)\nUnfortunately mFormat.format() is very allocation-hungry all on its own,\nand the previous implementation would re-create format strings for values\nthat it had already once created.  The caching eliminates all excessive\nallocations for strings that have already been generated, reducing garbage\nsubstantially.\nAs for failing to recycle the points not being an issue in terms of correct\nfunctioning of the application, the recycling exists as a way to improve\nperformance where it's needed, such as in animated graphs, or graphs that\nupdate values over time.  It's there to allow users the option to be\neconomical.  The comparisons in the zip file are striking, and the option\nis a good one to have.  The FSize and PointF savings in memory allocation\nis larger still than the large savings from caching the strings, given the\nthousands of instantiations that occur even with a small dataset.\nTony Patino | Development Lead\ntonypatino@monoclesociety.com\n206.718.8363 <+206-718-8363> (mobile)\nOn Sat, Aug 6, 2016 at 11:14 AM, Daniel Cohen Gindi \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHow is caching the string formatter giving you any benefit?

This and all other similar items are addressed in my local branch based on the remove_xindeces branch.  remove_xindeces will soon be merged into master, and it introduces many changes that will make this pull redundant (eg: changes to the Axis renderers, completely removing Realm from the repo, etc).\n. \n",

It has a variable mDrawWeb, which might be combined with what you added in your PR (AxisBase#mDrawGridLinesBehindData). @almic This seems to me as ready to be merged. As this is a small change and can be quickly reviewed and possibly merged.. This was done in PR https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/3207.\nIssue can be closed.. There's a PR for multiline axis labels https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/3190\nHowever it does not support different fonts/font sizes. . There are 2 problems in your code:\n1. AxisBase#setLabelCount(int, boolean) is improperly used. It should point to the amount of entries if you want to draw x value of each Entry. Change to entries count.\n2. You should use formatter.IAxisValueFormatter directly instead of formatter.IndexAxisValueFormatter - the last one is for entries, whose value in form 1...N, I think, which is not your case.\nThen it should work. So I guess, that the remaining problem is centering values, right?. Could you try removing:\nchart.getXAxis().setCenterAxisLabels(true);\nfrom your configuration?\nCould you then describe the effect?.

Could you please share a crashlog, too?. > Is there any way of using Big decimal or double values in entry object?\nNo. Whole library is done around float type of Entries\n\nIs there any way to persist original non-rounded values in entry object?\n\nOverride a chart and method: Chart#setupDefaultFormatter(float min, float max) supplying your own IValueFormatter implementation. setCenterAxisLabels on XAxis is known to have issues.\nPutting another issues for reference:\n3810\n3908.

I have the very same issue.\n@PhilJay\nhttps://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-XAxisValueFormatter-interface\nThis link mentions how to use XAxisValueFormatter. But the problem is, the class is available in an older version 2.1.4. Not sure why the class is missing from 3.0.0-beta.\nIn 3.0.0-beta there is a method setValueFormatter(AxisValueFormatter axisValFormatter) in XAxis class - Method in this class public String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) does not allow to set custom text labels for X-Axis\nIs there any way to set text labels for X-Axis based on String[] labels?\n. Hi, I am facing the very same problem. Details here #2043 \n. @xainbutt thanks for posting the code. Having the labels on top of the bar is a good idea.\nI tried a different workaround. By extending the AxisValueFormatter. Here appNames is a String array having labels. You can pass this String array to the instance of class extending AxisValueFormatter. Then within the getFormattedValue method returning the label value based on the label array length, also adding the x-Axis float value to a temporary ArrayList.\nI like your solution.\n@Override\n    public String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n        String xValue = \"\";\n        if (xValues.size() <= appNames.length) {\n            xValues.add(value);\n        }\n        int index = xValues.indexOf(value);\n        if (index >=0 && index < appNames.length)\n            xValue = appNames[index];\n        return xValue;\n    }\n.

As far as i searched or looked at source, i couldn't find anything..and that's the reason i created this issue\n. alright guys, i just found how we can display labels on the x axis... I hope i'm not too late..\n@Wadoks @developer1011 @JulioCesarSiqueira \nFirst have your labels in a string array. \nGet xAxis\nUse ValueFormatterInterface on xAxis\n```\nfinal String[] ds = new String[7];\n    ds[0]=\"Lights\";\n    ds[1]=\"Generator\";\n    ds[2]=\"Ups\";\n    ds[3]=\"Ac\";\n    ds[4]=\"Lights\";\n    ds[5]=\"Fan\";\n    ds[6]=\"Ac\";\nXAxis xval = barChart.getXAxis();\nxval.setDrawLabels(true);\nxval.setValueFormatter(new AxisValueFormatter() {\n    @Override\n    public String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n        Log.i(\"zain\", \"value \" + value);\n        return ds[Math.round(value)];\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getDecimalDigits() {\n        return 0;\n    }\n});\n\n```\n. But there is a problem with this, if we zoom the chart the labels that refer the bars dont quite follow them..then it looks there are some bars that dont have labels.. @PhilJay \nand one more thing, how can i make chart to scroll when there is lots of data rather than shrinking bars..And thank you for this amazing library..\n\n. @saiidabs its been a while i used mpcharts... as far as i remember i solved this with another thing that i cant remember right now..i'll post something as soon as i get my hands on my code because its in another computer... and sorry for coming late to the party...\n.

    "stoichoandreev": "Sorry guys I found the problem, it was coming from one dummy data left by some of my tests :). In case that somebody is wondering how I am building this kind of graph : I am using the graph just inside my view and everything connected with the graph is disabled. I have one simple idea about feature to this library. You can try to make \"Mode\" for the graph where the graph could be putted on separate layer (below or on top of other views). In this case the graph axises and legend could be hidden and we can draw a lot of custom stuff around the graph just to customise it. BTW if the library start returning the coordinates of every single dot on the screen it will be amazing because all those custom stuff can be aligned relative to the dots coordinates. Thanks for the library and good luck!\n. ",

    "mburst": "@PhilJay sorry for not being more specific with the report. The issue is indeed that the first graph pictured does not start at 0. The reason I believe this is a bug is due to the fact that I am passing (0,0) as a value but it is not showing up in the graph that has large negative components. Even setting the last value to a positive number does not fix the issue. Is there perhaps some other value I need to set that I'm just not aware of?\n. ",
    "alex-marochko": "Thanks for answering.\nYes, scrolling of chart content, with 'pages effect', when every 'page' snaps while scrolling. For example, if i want to show only one whole week at time at XAxis - from sunday to saturday, i can set\nlineChart.setVisibleXRangeMaximum(7.0f);\n        lineChart.setVisibleXRangeMinimum(7.0f);\n(7 days of week) but i don't now how to make chart not to stop in a week middle while scroll/fling. Is that possible?\n. Hi.\nI tried to change the library to get this effect, but didn't succeed - page scrolling was not smooth. I didn't find any other free lib with all necessary properties. That's why I built absolutely crazy construction... I placed transparent (but touchable) ViewPager above the chart. ))) I connect its scrolling to chart's one via OnDragListener and OnPageChangeListener. So ViewPager's scroll 'snapping' animation became chart's one.\nThat's not easy, especially if number of pages changes. But if you have no other solutions - it's not too hard.\nI remember, there also was an issue about separating scrolling gestures (these are for ViewPager) and touches for selecting data at chart. If you need, I'll show you necessary parts of my code.. ",

horizontally between several fragments of this type.

    "MrTopCat": "For anyone who comes across this thread at a later stage, I've got some tips for you, if you are using Unix Timestamps as values on your chart.\nThe library seems to have issues whilst using unix timestamps, I think the reason for this is because the library uses float values, which are not accurate enough for numbers with a lot of values.\nMy original image shows what the graph looks like when I reduce the amount of values on the graph. This is what it looks like when I don't reduce the values:\n\nAs a workaround for both issues, you should use integer values as your x values which increment for every piece of data you have. This x value then goes inside your entry object. The actual timestamp now goes inside of an arraylist.\nArraylist:\nfinal List<Long> timeStamps = new ArrayList<>();\nCreation of entries:\nList<Entry> entriesTime = new ArrayList<>();\n    int x = 0;\n    for (GraphObject obj: data) {\n      entriesTime.add(new Entry(x, (float) obj.getYValue()));\n      timeStamps.add(obj.getTimestamp());\n      x++;\n    }\nNow, when you want to format your values, simply refer to the corresponding item in the list in the AxisValueFormatter: \n```\n    AxisValueFormatter xAxisValueFormatter = new AxisValueFormatter() {\n      @Override\n      public String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n        SimpleDateFormat timeAmPm = new SimpleDateFormat(\"hh:mm a\", Locale.ENGLISH);\n        return timeAmPm.format(timeStamps.get((int)value));\n      }\n  @Override\n  public int getDecimalDigits() {\n    return 0;\n  }\n};\n\n```\nThis is what it looks like if you implement the workaround:\n\n.

    "cauli": "@achercasky One way to do it is to extend the renderer of your corresponding chart (PieChartRenderer), then override one of the drawing methods of the original renderer:\n``` java\npublic class CustomPieChartRenderer extends PieChartRenderer {\n    private Context context;\npublic CustomPieChartRenderer(PieChart chart, ChartAnimator animator,\n                        ViewPortHandler viewPortHandler) {\n    super(chart, animator, viewPortHandler);\n    context = chart.getContext();\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void drawExtras(Canvas c) {\n    super.drawExtras(c);\n    drawImage(c);\n}\n\nprivate void drawImage(Canvas c) {\n    MPPointF center = mChart.getCenterCircleBox();\n\n    Drawable d =  ResourcesCompat.getDrawable(context.getResources(), R.drawable.ic_your_drawable, null);\n\n    if(d != null) {\n        float halfWidth = d.getIntrinsicWidth() / 2;\n        float halfHeight = d.getIntrinsicHeight() / 2;\n\n        d.setBounds((int) (center.x - halfWidth), (int) (center.y - halfHeight), (int) (center.x + halfWidth), (int) (center.y + halfHeight) );\n        d.draw(c);\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThen, in your activity or fragment, when you instantiate your chart you need to use your renderer and invalidate the standard one:\n``` java\nmChart.setRenderer(new CustomPieChartRenderer(\n        mChart,\n        mChart.getAnimator(),\n        mChart.getViewPortHandler()\n));\n// When setting a new renderer, we need to invalidate the old one\nmChart.invalidate();\n```\n.

Do you know how to fix it?\n. @NeoLSN  I think the problem is that the view port is too small, so the x axis can only display 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5..... However, the bars are located at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... And you probably set labels at x axis as label[(int) value], where label is the array of labels. So in the view port, the labels are : 0 -> label[0], 1.5 -> label[1], 3 -> label[3], 4.5 -> labe[4],  and 1, 2, 4 do not even show. That's why the labels are in a mess.\nMy dump solution is to make the view port include more bars so that x axis can show all integers. When showing the labels, if  value % 1 != 0, make it return \"\", otherwise return label[(int) value]. This solution works for me.\n. ",

If the x values exceed that threshold then make a new data set. \nThe marker is not highlighting the data because there is no data there, but the library still connects the dots between the (0059.0, 247.25) and (0100.0, 247.3) data points.\n. Instead of CUBIC_BEZIER, try using HORIZONTAL_BEZIER and see if that works any better. I had all sorts of problems with CUBIC_BEZIER.. For the tooltip, use a Marker.\nFor the star, probably some sort of custom Renderer though there may be an easier way.. Great! Glad I could help. I had need for this and ended up leaving it off to implement later (to do more important things). Later on I ended up needing limit lines to denote sections of the graph. So I modified the library to allow you to place a label on the center bottom of a limit line. \nWhile this change may not be the best solution to your problem, it would work. Just add limit lines at every point you need to show a label for. You can check out my changes at #2631 and a very rough quick example on my fork here.  \nJust make sure you really want to show that many labels, because the more labels you add at specific points the higher chance they will overlap, especially on smaller screens.\nAgain, it may not be the best solution to your use case but if you need something quick this will work.. No problem, happy to help. The easiest way is probably replacing your gradle dependency with \ncompile 'com.github.jstav:MPAndroidChart:limit-line-label-bottom-SNAPSHOT'\nYou can also fork it yourself and make the changes, and then point gradle to your fork. This makes is safer because you have control of the changes.. As long as you have maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" } in your repositories in build.gradle it will work. JitPack is an excellent service.. You want to move to the end of the chart and make it scrollable?\nTry this:\nchart.setVisibleXRange(10, 10);\nchart.moveViewToX(chart.getXChartMax())\n. Try lowering the cubic intensity with dataSet.setCubicIntensity(). Default is 0.2f. Mine is set to 0.1f.. Yeah, smoothing leaves a lot to be desired in this library. We only really have CUBIC_BEZIER and HORIZONTAL_BEZIER. I have this problem too and there's not much you can really do. \nOther libraries like D3 for js have many more options that work better. Unfortunately we do not have that. It's probably a good candidate for a feature addition/pull request.. If it works every 3 points then yeah it would be a workaround to just make a new line data set every 3 points. You would just have to make sure that it looks good in all possible scenarios.\nD3 as far as I know is a JavaScript only library so I don't think you can use that unless you plop it all into a WebView but that's kind of messy.. You can use a ScatterDataSet and use CombinedData/CombinedChart instead of LineData/LineChart. \nIs this graph supposed to have different sets of data or will it always be the same? If the data changes you probably can't use this method because there's no way to tell which points you need to separate to make the curve work other than trial and error.. I think you will run into many other problems with the library on the way, even if you fix this one. Unfortunately I don't really know a good alternative or something that could help you achieve this so I can't be of much help with that, sorry. Might have to roll your own custom solution.. Perhaps using axis.setGranularityEnabled(true) and axis.setGranularity will help. Also chart.setVisibleXRange to something smaller than the full dataset. Showing less data and allowing it to scroll could also help.. ",

Hi @iRuth ,\nThe float x = Float.parseFloat(da.substring(0,da.lastIndexOf(\".\"))); is storing date values but it is not used.\nThe cnt default value is 0.  I want dates on X-Axis so I have stored cnt and parsed it later.\nWe can not store string value to entry list thus I have added cnt to entry list and applied formatting on x-axis which parses cnt to date. like this.\n```\n    xAxis.setValueFormatter(new IAxisValueFormatter() {\n        SimpleDateFormat mFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yy\");\n    @Override\n    public String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n        if (xAxisArrayList.size() >= 0 && value >= 0) {\n            if (value < xAxisArrayList.size()) {\n                stringValue = mFormat.format((new Date((long) xAxisArrayList.get((int) value))));\n            } else {\n                stringValue = \"\";\n            }\n        } else {\n            stringValue = \"\";\n        }\n        return stringValue;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getDecimalDigits() {\n        return 0;\n    }\n});\n\n```\nBoth sets have different YAxis array because I require two different line on a chart.\nThe issues are X-Axis values of data set 2 is not mapping properly. \n.

    "patrick-iv": "I should add that I tried to adjust the spacing by modifying XAxis.setAxisMinValue/setAxisMaxValue but that also adds gridlines for those points which is not what I want\n. If I were to hazard a guess I'd say that it's the Bezier smoothing causing the dip. Try changing to:\nlineDataSet.setMode(LineDataSet.Mode.HORIZONTAL_BEZIER);\nand see if that helps. If it does but HORIZONTAL_BEZIER is not enough, you need to adjust the minimum value of the left axis to something < 0.\n. You need to re-map the values to reflect the sorted order, I would probably do something like this:\nfinal int[] ids = new int[]{0, 1, 2};\nfinal int[] values = new int[]{10, 30, 20};\n\n// do fancy sorting...\n\nfinal int[] sortedIds = new int[]{0, 2, 1};\nfinal int[] sortedValues = new int[]{10, 20, 30};\n\nfinal String[] labels = new String[sortedIds.length];\nfinal List<BarEntry> entries = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int i = 0; i < sortedValues.length; i++) {\n    entries.add(new BarEntry(i, sortedValues[i]));\n    labels[i] = String.valueOf(sortedIds[i]);\n}\n\nand then use labels inside a ValueFormatter to show the correct values. By using i as the x value you will reflect the new order.. I've had this issue as well, you can try doing something like this, assuming your x values are evenly distributed (e.g xValues = [0, 1, 2, 3 ..., n]):\nfinal float minXValue = ...; // the actual min X value of the dataset \nfinal float maxXValue = ...; // the actual max X value of the dataset \ngetXAxis().setAxisMinimum(minXValue - 0.5f);\ngetXAxis().setAxisMaximum(maxXValue + 0.5f);\n\nI don't have my solution in front of me atm, but I'm pretty sure that solved it for me.\n. So the issue here is that the half pie chart is still taking up the same size as a full one. As I understand it, there's no simple solution for that since the view does not change it's desired height based on the data and properties. However it does look like you have your PieChart and buttons in a vertical LinearLayout. As long as you make sure the buttons fit below the actualy data, you could do something like this:\n<FrameLayout\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"@dimen/some_defined_view_height\"\n    >\n\n    <com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.PieChart\n        android:id=\"@+id/chart\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        />\n\n    <LinearLayout\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n        android:layout_gravity=\"bottom\"\n        >\n\n        <Button\n            android:id=\"@+id/button_1\"\n            ... />\n\n        <Button\n            android:id=\"@+id/button_2\"\n            .../>\n\n    </LinearLayout>\n\n</FrameLayout>\n\n... and Yes, I agree, it's not the prettiest solution but it should work.. Hi, are you calling chart.invalidate() after changing the data set?. Does it work if you add chart.notifyDataSetChanged()?. Hi, great that you found the answer :) but you should probably close the issue.. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/How-not-to-contribute\n\nHow NOT to contribute:\n\n...\nUsing a language other than English (preferred) or German (if necessary)\n.... I think you would have to extend the whatever chart class you're using and override onTouch to get the position and onDraw to draw the circle. Just remember to call super.onDraw(canvas); in onDraw before doing custom drawing.. To be honest, that's more of a question for StackOverflow, not an issue for the lib. \n\n",

I don't know if there is a seperate method for this but as a workaround you can use a custom ValueFormatter. There you can check for 0 and return an empty string.\n. Swift? This project is done in java. The iOS counterpart of the project is Charts. You should open a issue there.. So what is your actual code? The first or the second? Both? . Could you add a screenshot?. I think this is not really possible with the default libary, you need to build that on your own.. There you go https://jitpack.io/com/github/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/v3.0.1/MPAndroidChart-v3.0.1.jar. So.. what is the question?. Can you post the error and relevant code?. mLineData.notifyDataChanged();\nmChart.notifyDataSetChanged();. chart.getXAxis().setAvoidFirstLastClipping(true); should do the trick. Experiment with chart.getXAxis().setLabelCount(n); or rotate the labels\n. Do you mean the x,y value you set on an entry or do you mean the actual position in the displayed graph?. Hm. Good question. I doesn't look like there is a easy way to access that data.. Do you mean the 'The year 2017' text? That legend entries are set over the DataSet object, in this case set1 = new BarDataSet(yVals1, \"The year 2017\");. Top right? Do you mean the description or the legend? To disable that try this:\nchart.getDescription().setEnabled(false);\nchart.getLegend().setEnabled(false);. Well, you have a BarChart and you are working with a linechart in your Java Code. Also the android:id is not matching. \nIf you are you defining it in the xml file there is no need to create a new instance in code you just need to set the data.. chart.setVisibleXRange(start, stop), you just need to know which x_value you have assigned for that range,. ?\nWhat do you mean? . chart.getXAxis().setAvoidFirstLastClipping(true); for the first problem. \nFor the second one, hm. Maybe you need to keep the labels constant and not alter it based on the scale depth. . Wrong Project. You need to go to https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Modifying-the-Viewport \nsetExtraOffsets() should work. As an alternative way create a layout with a margin that wraps the chart. That should work also.. XAXis Values are now set over a valueformatter, see https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/Setting-Data\nLineData data = new LineData();\nmLineChart.setData(data);. Limitlines could help you at this task. https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-Axis. I think there is nothing like that implemted in the libary. They are Markers that are pretty close to that what you want (mark a specific point with a custom view), but they are limited to the values the user highlightes.\nYou could extend the implementation of the markers, but that would be a bigger task,. Not really, the highlighter is designed to highlight values on the chart... If you mean the axis values with \"chart labels\": You can set custom axis values via IAxisValueFormatter. Check https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface. You are using the method wrong. It takes a min and a max parameter.\npublic void setVisibleXRange(float minXRange, float maxXRange)\nYou should also update to 3.0.1.\n. Is invalidate/notifyDataChanged missing?. Was it saved to the DCIM folder?. https://jitpack.io/com/github/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/v3.0.1/MPAndroidChart-v3.0.1.jar. Just use the github search?.

Not sure when this change was made but it should probably be documented. . I just ran across this too. For some reason the library is using DataIndex not DataSetIndex. On your highlight object callSetDataIndex(index). I'm setting it to my dataset index and it seems to be working. But it's a little odd. . Unfortunately that doesn't work for me, because empty and 0 have different meanings. In my chart a missing bar means data wasn't recorded, where as 0 is a possible valid value. . Unfortunately that doesn't work the problem is the groupBars method in BarData loops through the data by index.

    "philippeauriach": "the solution with limit lines actually looks perfect !  testing right now. thanks for your quick answer. I do not want to actually display 53 labels, I juste want to pick precisely which one to be displayed (not having the lib to decide that label at position 5.67 or whatever to be displayed, I need 5 and 6, always, the graph is non scrollable).\n. Just one thing though, how could I point to your fork instead of the lib ? . did not know this was possible, thanks a lot !. ok your solution works ! thanks again. There is just a problem with labels been \"cut\" by the graph view, but I should be able to handle this by giving the graph a bigger y range.. @JStav thanks for your solution, but unfortunately it did not exactly fit my needs : the labels are indeed well positioned, but they are above the graph (not above or under the graph like labels). \nSo I tweaked the lib and added the ability to specify exactly where labels should be drawn : \nhttps://github.com/philippeauriach/MPAndroidChart/tree/custom-labels\nWith this solution you can ask the graph to draw labels at positions for example 10, 20 and 60, and those three label will always be drawn, the others wont. Because of this, it is only suitable for fixed graph (without horizontal scaling/dragging). For now it is only made for the x axis, it should not be hard to implement the same thing for y. It is working right now but need further testing and maybe some code styling / adjustment, fine tuning etc... before I'll make a PR. In the meantime I'm open to suggestions !\nThanks again @JStav for your help.. Just created a PR here : https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/pull/2692. @sanogueralorenzo It could work yes, if you know how much years you are drawing (with my PR you must tell the graph exactly which labels should be drawn). For example : \nleftAxis.setSpecificLabelPositions(new float[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15});\nwould work (if your months are 0 based) for the first two years.\nOtherwise, if today you are able to display every month, but only wants the first 4 of each year, I suggest creating a custom value formatter and returning an empty string for the months you dont want to display.. @rohangoqii my PR does not modify how the axis is drawn, just which labels at which positions: if you provide label outside of the axis range, they just wont be displayed.\nIn order to change the axis displayed range I suggest looking at the axis doc, you can customize max and min values using setAxisMaximum(float max) and setAxisMinimum(float min), it should help you achieve what you want..

    "RedSky7": "I imagine the problem is that your getColor(int index) in ScatterDataSet is getting duplicate indices. \nLet me explain. If you have 4 points your graph will try to get colors for them. But when getColor(int index) is called indices provided are 0, 0, 1, 1. And that's wrong. It should be 0, 1, 2, 3. That is why every two points are the same. \nI have a solution but it's more a proof of concept but it can still help someone. It requires two iterations and won't work if you zoom in and want to only show one scatterShape* or if you zoom in and wan't to slide pixel by pixel as it will show wrong values (without correction) for one iteration but will correct itself if you move it just a bit more.\n*You can fix the first issue by first detecting that you are getting the same index over and over as that tells you that you only have one left and then saving this value somewhere. \nSo now we know that if we have for example 5 points and they are all shown we will get indices as follows:\n0, 0, 1, 1, 2 (and they should map as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). But if we have 3 points visible (when zooming in), lets say points 3-5, we will get 1, 1, 2 (and should map as 2, 3, 4). \nAnd we can see that the sum of first two wrong indicies is actually the offset we need to apply at the begining. And we need a counter which will reset itself when it detects that current index is lower than the previous. \nBUT this requires that we calculate this sum and use it in the next iteration. As I have said it's far from a perfect solution but it should work.\nSo what we do is as following.\nFirst of all you have to override getColor(int index) as shown here. \nThen in MyScatterDataSet \nprevious = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\noffset = 0;\n//values = ArrayList of your data\nand in getColor(int index)\n```\n//if this is the second index save it for offset calculation\nif(temp.size() < 2 && previous != Integer.MAX_VALUE)\n    temp.add(index);\n//If we are starting over put in temp first digit of our correction and reset counter and calculate offset from previous iteration\nif(index  < previous)\n{\n     counter = 0;\n     if(temp.size() == 2) \n              offset = temp.get(0) + temp.get(1);\n     temp.clear();\n     temp.add(index);\n}\nelse\n      counter++;\nprevious = index;\n//Check if error and return wrong value as it will not work if you only want to display one box, this can be fixed like mentioned above\nif(counter + offset >= values.size()) \n{\n       return mColors.get(3);\n}\n//Get correct value for your right index which is counter + offset\nif(values.get(counter + offset ) == 2)\n        return mColors.get(0);\n```\n.

Yup, exactly what I'm looking at.. ",

What am I missing? . Update: found the LimitLine documentation in the discussion of axes. Would still like an answer to my first question. .

I have it working, but I'm not clear whether there are things I can do to speed up the redraw. \nMy basic question is: given a Line Chart with a single set of data, what is the fastest way to redraw the line with new data, while changing nothing else? What steps are essential, and what can be dispensed with, to get from a new List<Entry> to a redrawn line? (All the Lists are the same length.) \nIt might be helpful to have some kind of table, with entries like \"If you want to change THIS, you must do THIS and THIS\u2026\". To be a bit more specific: LineDataSet inherits setValues( List<T> values ) from DataSet. According to the description, this method \"sets the array of entries that this DataSet represents, and calls notifyDataSetChanged()\". So if I use this to change the data, can I then just call chart.invalidate() without going through the intermediate steps of making a new LineData object? . ",

    "Jetz72": "Pretty sure the labels aren't supposed to be handed to the chart data object like that. An AxisValueFormatter uses the position of the viewport along with some settings on its respective axis to create values. Sounds like you want to implement an AxisValueFormatter that maps positions to an array of months. You'll also want to set the granularity of the X axis to 1 so it doesn't try to fetch a string from labels[1.5] or anything.\nSee https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/The-AxisValueFormatter-interface for details.. Have you tried setColors instead of setColor? That allows you to use an array of colors instead of just one, where colors[0] will be used for the first entry, colors[1] for the second, and so on. Sounds like you may want a custom legend instead of the automatically generated one if you go this route. There's also setCircleColors which affects the points instead of the lines connecting them.\nAlso not sure why you're using BarEntries with a LineDataSet when normal Entry objects do fine for line data. Not sure if that will affect the display or if it's intentional, but aside from that, using setColors is pretty much what I've been doing, and it sounds like what you're looking for.. Hmm, if you want the values colored based on A, B or C, and you want the lines connecting A1 to A2, B1 to B2, and so on, it sounds like you're looking for a structure more like this:\nlinedatasetA\n{\n ValueOfA1\n ValueOfA2\n ValueOfA3\n}\nlinedatasetB\n{\n ValueOfB1\n ValueOfB2\n ValueOfB3\n}\nlinedatasetC\n{\n ...\nAnd so on. . If you have the ValueOfA1, ValueOfA2, and so on stored in arrays, then it wouldn't be hard to use a loop to generate a group using the four arrays, add it into a lineDataSet, style it, and add it to the chart's data set. If you need to setup 10 of them, it probably should be done dynamically anyway. . Issue 2 sounds like it's the conversion to floating point values. They're really not suited for storing dates, which are normally kept as longs. They lose precision at larger values, such as the 1.4 trillion milliseconds and counting since the epoch.\nMy current workaround is to keep a timestamp long value apart from the graph when I start recording data, and subtract that value from every Date before I convert it to a float for the Entry object. Then in a value formatter for the label, I convert the float back to a long, add the start time back in, and then create a Date and format it. For large windows of time it may also help to cut off the milliseconds entirely. I also keep a HashMap from X values to the original data, so when users tap on a point and the details are displayed, there's no chance of lost information.. I believe not setting an xAxis value formatter will leave you stuck with the default, which is just showing it as a big number. You'll probably want a custom value formatter as discussed above that will take the floats in the entries, process them back into dates, and use a DateFormat to display them how you want.\nAs for the weird spacing, I'm not sure. It may be related to the large floating point precision. I'd start with fixing the formatting. If that doesn't work, maybe try xAxis.setLabelCount(int count). . Try lineChartLayout.notifyDataSetChanged() and lineChartLayout.invalidate() after you've made all the adjustments.. Unfortunately, floats aren't good for handling large numbers. Once they get too far up there they'll start losing precision. Tragically, floats are all MPAndroidChart knows. \nAssuming your big numbers are all in the same ballpark as each other (it looks like you're using dates so I would assume so), you can work around this. When you get your first value, store it somewhere, and subtract it from every entry value as you add them. So numbers like 16314195, 16315200, 16316191 are stored as 0, 1005, 1996, and then convert them to a float. Then in a ValueFormatter for your axis, take that stored value, convert it back to the proper type, and add the stored value back in to get the original value, without loss of precision.. > I doubt you are actually experiencing the exact string 253,235,664 being turned into 253235661 in your code, since the biggest accurate number you can attain with a float is something around:\n\n\n340,282,346,638,528,860,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.000000\n\n\nThat's a bit misleading. Sure floats can handle that number accurately but only because that's the one everything remotely close to it gets rounded to. The non-exponent part of a float can only fit 23 bits of information. With only integers, you start to see loss of precision past 16777216. 253235661 does get rounded to 253235664, as the OP describes. . @almic Yes, the weakness of the floating point format is not a consequence of the library. However, the library's decision to rely on that format means it carries that limitation all the same. There are workarounds, but the existence of a workaround speaks to the existence of a problem. It may not be realistically fixable, but it is still a problem. There have been many people here looking for information regarding how to correctly use timestamps as values, and perhaps the proper workaround for that could be made more clear in the wiki or documentation.\nHowever, I feel like I should clarify that when I say:\n\nTragically, floats are all MPAndroidChart knows.\n\nI do not intend it as a slight against the project or the work that has gone into it. You are right to point to what the library is capable of, as the end result works as intended. I was only lamenting the circumstances that ultimately make getting there less straightforward than one might hope for. \nIn any case, glad to see some development activity in this library. It's one I've found useful, and will no doubt need to make use of again at some point, so best of luck to you all.. Data points can be added at any time, and multiple data sets can exist on one chart. As for helping you, read through the project wiki and look at the examples, then ask something more specific if you have trouble.. Set an AxisValueFormatter that shortens your values, and/or use Axis.setLabelCount(int count) to reduce the number of labels that will display.. Looks like you're never giving your fragment an arguments bundle containing the JSON string. So the try block in getTemperatures never happens, the array of entries remains empty, the LineDataSet gets created with no data, and MPAndroidChart doesn't like it when told to render a LineDataSet with no entries. \n2455 is the underlying issue.. Use an AxisValueFormatter (see the wiki for details), in conjunction with a DateFormat configured to only display hours and minutes. Just remember if you're using dates as X-Values, you'll want to reduce them to numbers floating point variables can handle. Cutting out everything but the time of day and dividing out the seconds and milliseconds would do this, and then it could be multiplied back to a valid value in the formatter before running it through the DateFormat.. Oh, are you using time as your Y values? I presumed you were using timestamps for the X values, which often comes up here. In that case, yes, a ValueFormatter would be appropriate for displaying the values of the individual bars. Make the Y values of each entry a raw number like number of minutes of number of seconds, and use a value formatter that uses that number to generate the displayed value.. Not on hand. You might try the wiki for bar graph examples, though I'm not sure if the examples will demonstrate this specifically enough. It would be easier if you showed your attempt and explain what you've gotten it to do so far.. Possibly, but for a bar graph entry to function, it needs a numerical value to indicate the height of the bar anyway. What value are you using for that? Formatting that makes the most sense. Alternatively, you could probably use the dataSetIndex or entry parameters of the ValueFormatter's getFormattedValue method to fetch the hours and minutes from your array, ignoring the entry's value entirely.. Wherever you found instructions to use setCustom like that (presumably the wiki), it's out of date. setCustom is now used with an array or List of LegendEntry objects, which contain details on how to format each entry.\nThe wiki should probably be updated, and there should have at least been a deprecated method in there that takes the original parameters and wraps the new implementation, but you should be able to change it on your end with no problems. Just read through the JavaDoc on LegendEntry and setCustom for details.. > Note: The values inside both of my DataSet are consecutive entries\nAre you saying they go something like \"6 7 8\" for one and \"9 10 11\" for the next? That would create a gap because there's no way to interpolate between the value at 9 and the value at 10 to draw a line. You could probably get around this by putting the opposite data set on the appropriate end of one of the two data sets, like \"6 7 8 9\" or \"8 9 10 11\" (but not both). May create some issues with overlapping data points, though.\nYou may want to instead achieve the same effect using a single data set, colored using the selection methods or with setColors.. Never really tried fills before. Not sure if you can set more than one, and I can't find anything about it. Might be able to do it by overriding the LineChartRenderer with one that can display multiple fills, and then using setRenderer to replace the default one with that.\nAlternatively, if you can't modify either data set to include a redundant data point, you could perhaps create a third data set that acts as the bridge. Can be set to not draw its points, values, or circles, so it's only used to visually connect the two series.. To answer your final question, yes you can get the value from an array list. Shouldn't be much different to how you implemented the labels of the bar graph. You can get the X position from the Entry object and, assuming the bars are aligned by integer, pull them straight from an array list with their position as the index.. Seems like an issue with synchronization. Only way I could see that problem with that array is if notifyDataSetChanged was called as it was rendering.  Do you have a thread responsible for updating the data on the graph that might happen concurrently with the graph being drawn? You may want to try posting the data and update notice as a Runnable over to the UI thread instead. . Not really my code, I'm just here because I like solving problems. In Android, methods that affect the content of views directly will often have problems if done from anywhere other than the UI thread. Attempting to synchronize the operations wouldn't help unless you wrapped large portions of the code, and doing that would drag down the rendering thread as it's waiting for everything to be updated, which should have been done on the UI thread. There may be a few ways to make developers more aware of it, but the general issue \"Don't touch the UI outside of the UI thread\" probably isn't going away.. Not sure how the charts will handle Float.NaN but if that doesn't work, you could use a custom ValueFormatter that replaces 0 or NaN with \"No Data\".  A lack of data in some cases can also be indicated by not having a bar for it at all, but that may just be ambiguous.. The interface has been updated since then, and I haven't used 2.2.4, myself. The best reference would be the source for your version. The interface name doesn't have the 'I' on it, but it should be fairly similar. \nCreate a class that implements ValueFormatter and the getFormattedValue method. It can be an anonymous class, or you can use whatever activity or fragment has the rest of your code, or it can be its own utility class. You can use some of the code for the DefaultValueFormatter to start with, though if you're not using an external class, I'd advise ditching the constructor and getting the DecimalFormat elsewhere. \nBesides that, all you need is an if statement in getFormattedValue that checks if the value parameter is 0, and if it is, return whatever text is appropriate. It might also be possible to use -0.0f for your unknown values if you need zeroes on the chart. If that's not an option, you'll need to store a \"no data\" flag elsewhere, like a boolean array with one for each bar.. As far as I'm aware, there's no automatic functionality for this. You could manually achieve it by moving the view manually when you add the first point that would go outside your range. I think mChart.moveViewToX will allow you to do that. . @judemanutd I'm not actually a contributor to this project, or an authority on issues. I just responded to threads to help some people back when I was using the library myself. No developer seemed active here at the time and I had advice and information I could share, so I did. I responded to your thread the other day because you asked my input specifically, but I'm no expert on this. I don't have experience with bar graphs so I can't help with this particular issue much more than anyone else could.. What type is tempTime, and how does TankLevel store and retrieve timestamps?. Looks pretty similar to things I've done, and I don't see any reason this would cause a rounding issue unless I'm missing something or it's occurring outside what you've posted. 3600 shouldn't be any trouble for floating points. This isn't really a solution (and you may have done this already for all I know), but I'd try narrowing it down with log calls, printing out tempTime, time, the timestamp, Entry.getX(), value, the other timestamp, and millis, as they're computed and stored. Isolating where the problem is would be valuable information.. ",

Seems to be a similar issue in #2744 and #1011 . @Jetz72 thank you for all the help, much appreciated. . >Gantt charts! This does sound like something that should exist in this library, and with the currently existing functions this shouldn't be too difficult to implement in a future version.\n@almic that sounds great, not to sound pushy or anything but have you put any kind of timeline for this feature?\n. cool good to know and love the work you've put into the library, great job.\nAlso quick question, I have a hack which is still a work in progress but needed to know something.\n```\nYAxis yBarAxis = barChart.getAxisLeft();\nyBarAxis.setValueFormatter(new IAxisValueFormatter() {\n@Override\npublic String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n\n/* at this point is it possible to get the respective \n   x axis value that was initially passed to the chart\n   or if not is it possible to relate a point here to an x-axis point */\n}\n\n});\n```\nBasically my I want to add the x-axis value for a particular bar in the bar chart to value on the y-axis. Its easy if there is a single bar but for multiple bars each would have their own base x-axis value.. tempTime is of type long. TankLevel is just a pojo class, here's the definition for it. The date variable here is a unix timestamp in seconds.\n```\npublic final class TankLevel {\nprivate int id;\n\nprivate int level;\n\nprivate long date;\n\npublic int getId() {\n    return id;\n}\n\npublic int getLevel() {\n    return level;\n}\n\npublic long getTimestamp() {\n    return date;\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis class is populated by the data i fetch from my endpoint.\nThe above situation occurs on the initial load of the graph, without any zoom or expansion, zooming into the graphn eventually sorts out the data and the point gets correctly marked on the x-axis.. Where exactly should I be running Entry.getX() because I have logged the output of the entire List objects after looping through it and verified the data which is correct. Will check again though, thanks for the suggestions.\nOn a side note, instead of inserting the actual value ie the timestamp into entries.add(new Entry(time, tankLevel.getLevel())); I did entries.add(new Entry(i, tankLevel.getLevel())); where i is the index in the loop. This way I could easily get the correct value  inside the getFormattedValue function from the global tankLevels list without losing any data but that leads to duplicate x axis entries and I can't really specify the granularity as these are random points spread over a certain time period that varies.\nI am still in the process of figuring out the library but could you provide a little insight as to why the global list method doesn't work.\nAnother question, if I use the above workaround of subtracting the greatest value from all others, should I be sorting the array after that?.

Or perhaps you can extend BubbleDataSet and provide a method to set mMaxSize. See my comments on issue #3304. They should explain what is going on.\n. I have a several comments:\n\n\nYour expectation that the bubble size will be 10 does not make any sense. 10 what? If you look at your chart, each bubble is 1 x-unit wide and about 20 left-axis-units high (~90 - 110) and 35 right-axis-units high (~185 to 220). The bubbles must be scaled to make them round rather than oval, so the radius of the circle drawn on the chart can not be the size field of the BubbleEntry (although they are directly proportional). \n\n\nThe size of the largest drawn circle in a data set is computed to be one x-unit wide. (This maximum size is reduced if that would make the largest circle bigger than the y range.) That is exactly what you got, and is what you will always get. (Although you might play around with the idea of putting a large BubbleEntry outside the chart area to limit the size of the visible circles. I am not sure how that might work.)\n\n\nThe mapping from BubbleEntry size to drawn radius is not intuitive. It depends on the size of the largest entry in the data set (see #2), the scaling of the axes, and whether BubbleDataSet mNormalizeSize is true or false. If true, the entry size is assumed to be an area; if false it is assumed to be a radius. If you had different size bubbles, the drawn circles would scale accordingly.\n\n\nThe value that is displayed in the circle is provided by ValueFormatter.getBubbleLabel(entry). It defaults to getFormattedValue(bubbleEntry.getSize()). If you want to display something different, you need to override this method or provide a different formatter.. \n\n",

The code above works for 8, but if i change the \"end year\" value to 12, it doesnt work and gets grouped as 4 bars. I need it to group as 2 .

By the way I just encountered with the problem a couple hours ago and searched through the source code. I found this workaround after reading the Chart.java source code. Please tell me if you found better way. Thanks ^^.

Will wait for upcoming versions with hope to see improvements and bug fixes for reported bugs. Thank you all, wish all the best. \ud83d\udc4d   . I clearly understand that on your side. But on my side the code is really to long and can't be shared here to understand the logic. But i wonder if this can be solved with a try-catch in the library, because in fact this issue doesn't make any weird change in the chart view but just crash the app. So if this is possible i think will be more easy to just solve for the moment. Thank you for your support ! This is sometime more important than a bug. \nWaiting for sulution.. @PaulWoitaschek , do you find any solution for this ? It is really causing problems with Apps Stability. And Crash Rate have major impact on App visibility/ranking in the Play Store.. ",

    "gcasar": "It seems the rendering is done in LineChartRenderer which does not support limit lines. The quickest way would be to implement your own renderer. Set it by calling setRenderer().\nHope this helps :). To do it your way you should insert new values at correct spots to break the color at the limit line.\nSo, for each new data point check if the new line segment would intersect any of your limit lines. If it does insert a new data point at the intersection. \nAnother posible solution is by overriding onDraw callback and drawing rectangles with paint.setXfermode(new PorterDuffXfermode(Mode.ADD));. Actually I suggest you do this, might be the simplest solution available.. You can color each LineDataSet diferently. Do so with dataSet.setColors( color ). Be sure to resolve your color first, it needs to be 32bit RGBA :) . The easiest way to achieve this is to call setViewPortOffsets(0,0,0,0); in addition to your code above.\nYou can remove quite a bit of your code by calling setEnabled(false); on each axis.\nAnother way is with chart.setExtraOffsets(0,0,0,0); but I'm having trouble getting the chart to recalculate its offsets (setViewPortOffsets does this for us)..

Yes, the last image from my initial post (the question itself) is almost perfect.\nI've achieved that already by subtracting 0.5f:\nchart.getXAxis().setValueFormatter(new IndexAxisValueFormatter(months) {\n       @Override\n       public String getFormattedValue(float value, AxisBase axis) {\n           Timber.i(\"index = %s\", value);\n           return super.getFormattedValue(value - 0.5f, axis);\n       }\n   });\nRegarding granularity of the axis, doesn't that only comes into the equation if zoom is available?\n\n\nSet a minimum interval for the axis when zooming in. The axis is not allowed to go below\nthat limit. This can be used to avoid label duplicating when zooming in.\n\n\n\n\nI don't allow zooming.\n\nPerhaps the best solution is to change the defaults to hard-coded constants instead of automatic calculations?\n\nWhat to you mean by this?\nThanks for your time and help..

And, the 9-patch file will take less space, because there is a lot of repeating content in it.\nSo, what you get:\n\nSame files count, less code.\nno distorted content\nconsistent padding on the sides of the text.\nFor short text, no huge empty text\nLess space for a simple image file.. @almic Seeing that the TextView has android:layout_marginLeft=\"5dp\" and android:layout_marginRight=\"5dp\" shows that whoever created it, wanted that this would be the space on the sides. \nThis fails because of the current implementation. \n\nYou still haven't shown why it shouldn't have 9-patch. I think it's the most classical case of using it : container with a background image that has dynamic content within.\nLooking at the current implementation, that's just not the way to do it.. ok. ",

    "exoji2e": "I experience the same error when using a thread to inject database data into a my graphs. The problem is due to MPAndroidChart not beeing threadsafe. In other words; when another thread manipulates the graph, while the UI-thread (Main thread) is handling an event caused by user interaction, nothing is guaranteed about the internal data inside the graph, since another thread is manipulating it.\nTo solve the problem you should let the UI-thread update the graph for you. Include all the code that manipulates your graph-object inside a Runnable and post it to the graph. My Kotlin-code looks like this: graph.post{Push2Plot.setPlot(readings, graph, start, end)}.  In Java you'll need some boilerplate-code to accomplish the same thing. You can read more here.\nSuggestion to @PhilJay: Might be nice to add something about this in the readme/wiki, especially since people are forced to use separate threads when communicating with a Room database.. @athathdev please let me know if this helped you solve your problem..

It isn't easy to find out because all the examples provided have a white background & the semi transparent circle has a white base color, so you might think the 'transparentCircle' runs only above the slices.
