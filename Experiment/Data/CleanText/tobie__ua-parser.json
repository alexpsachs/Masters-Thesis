    "tobie": "Looks like there are slight changes in the way the JSON object is structured which aren't compatible with current code. I look at this over the week-end.\n. The property names are all wrong. Maybe they were different earlier. Maybe I manually changed them at some point (possible but super dumb if I did). Either way, it's a simple fix. Just want to run it before I push it.\n. Cherry-picked and pushed to master along with code fix. Bumped version number and pushed to npm registry: http://search.npmjs.org/#/ua-parser.\n. Well, it used to be a JSON file. :(\nI'd rather leave the canonical file where it is and switch to a YAML parser.\n. Fair point.\nFlying out back home today. Let me look at this over the week-end.\n. Mmm. Good point about the version numbers not necessarily being ints. Mind opening another issue about that?\n. Added a script to pull and parse upstream changes directly. Ran it and merged these changes. Closing.\n. The main reason why I actually added support for this was to able to do simple comparison between versions. Note sure how to handle that one. Thoughts?\n. Good point. Although NPM modules follow semver. Browsers don't.\n. For reference, semver's a package of it's own: https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver. Wondering how the upstream branch is handling this.\n. Fixed in #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. Thanks, cherry-picked the last one and pushed.\n. Can you remove the .svn dir that's in there, or is there a reason to keep it?\n. Standardizing on a attribut names is fine. It's also easy to keep the previous ones around for backwards compat purposes.\nI don't have a strong feeling about your second point other than that it shouldn't delay merging the projects.\n. The JS parser does support v1 and v2, it just calls them minor and patch (after SemVer).\n. Closing this and opening separate issues for what still needs to get done.\n. @dmolsen you can, just push them to separate branches.\n. @elsigh asigned that to you as you seem the most appropriate person to review @dmolsen's changes.\nI'm fine modifying the js code to point to whichever file we decide to keep after this.\n. OK, didn't know the history behind that. Is this something you want to do in the YAML regexes or in the Python code directly?\n. Awesome. You do the work. I benefit. I like that. :)\n. Sure. But why does it need write access?\n. LGTM.\n. Still unsure why the Ruby Gem couldn't be in the same folder, BTW.\n. Your second point seems a valid one. #1and #3 are red herrings, however.\nThat said, I'm myself in favor of creating an organization and\nsplitting the repo up, just haven't had the time to look into it nor\nto discuss naming with @elsigh.\n. Happy to include a link to other implementations in the main README.\n. @LeoColomb I'd like to make the move but want a clear strategy on how to share the regexp across repos. Eager to hear your proposal and submit it to @elsigh and @dmolsen.\n. What bothers me with this strategy is all projects need to actively upgrade everytime there's a change to the YAML.\n. That doesn't really address my concern. :(\n. For the ruby lib? Sure. Lets do this. Mind sending a PR?\n. Closing this as no one seems interested to build this.\n. Not sure, if not, patch, please. :)\n. Awesome. Thanks for your work.\nThis will need a license type before it gets pulled in.\nAlso wondering if there isn't value in adding a facade-like pattern for the most common use case (parse the UA string, get an object back). But you might disagree (and that's OK :-)).\n. LGTM. @elsigh can you confirm that [A-z] was intended as [A-Za-z]?\n. LGTM except for the fact that I have no clue how to read Haskell, and that it's missing a README (I know you know) and a code example in the main README.\n. Really thankful for the contribution, btw. It's great to se this project shaping up like this.\n. Any idea on when you can make those fixes? Would love to merge this PR.\n. Happy to merge a change that fixes the regexes stored here: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml\nI don't have the time to look into it myself atm.\n. LGTM. @elsigh can you vet this on the regexp side?\n. Bump, /cc @ozataman \n. NP. Wanted to pull your changes in nonetheless. Openend issues so this does't get forgotten.\n. Bump, /cc @ozataman\n. Fixed in #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. Can we please split up diffs for regexes.yaml from everything else?\nFine for merging that part. The rest of the JS changes I'd like to review separately. I'm not fond of the bitwise operator trick, unless there are proven performance benefits in what's cleary a bottleneck of the code.\nFurthermore, @bluesmoon mentioned in #5 that version numbers should be presented as strings (and not ints) as we're sometimes loosing info in the process of parsing these.\nI welcome a proposition of how to go about changing this to ship it in a 0.3 version.\nMakes sense?\n. Not sure what's best. Would like input from @bluesmoon as he reported the issue initially.\n. semver comparison only works reliably when the version strings are conformant to then  Semver spec.\nWhat are the ports in the other languages doing? Strings or ints?\nWhat about providing both?\n. There's too much different things going on in this PR for it to be pulled directly.\nHappy to consider some more atomic changes.\n. Commented in lots of places. Overall, would like to see this PR split up in 2-3 chunks taregting one thing only unless there's a compelling reason not to do so.\n. Sounds good. I'm wary of backwards compatibility issues, can you suggest a more elegant API which would allow us to do both?\n. No, we can't extend the language like that in a lib. It's a Very Bad Practice(TM).\n. Can we please split this up. One feature per PR. Thanks.\n. Slightly confused here. What we thought was the browser version is in fact the OS version?\nAlso, Netfront is the browser name, or the rendering engine name? (Seems the former, but browser engine is a synonym of rendering engine, so\u2026).\n. Why would you want to silence this error?\n. Can't this be done without backwards compat issues?\n. Really? Can't you memoize the YAML the first time it's parsed an use it from then on without modifying the API?\nSeems just checking for self::$regexes before fetching the YAML file should do the trick.\n. Your last option is of course to make the changes but make UA::parse() instantiate and hold on to a an instance of itself for backwards compatibility.\n. Keeping backwards compatibility is a great reason to slightly dirty the code. If for some reason, you don't want your class to have both static methods and be instantiable, just create another class for the instantiable part. The key here is that there is absolutely no reason to break backwards compat, so let's not do it. When you have lots of people relying on your code, breaking backwards compat when it is not absolutely necessary is the last thing you want to do.\n. Looks like a regression. Can you make a patch?\n. Pull request anyone?\n. Please split that up in smaller chunks with 1 PR == 1 feature. Thanks.\n. Closing. Duplicate of #78\n. /cc @elsigh \n. Awesome. Happy to merge this as soon as you've figured out a way to avoid needing a duplicate of the YAML file.\n. Ping @harryovers. Any updates? Would love to include this.\n. Bump @harryovers.\n. Bump @harryovers. Would love to include this. Have you managed to make the required changes?\n. @galmeida would you be interested in making the requested changes to the patch (and possibly doing some support for it)? @harryovers hasn't been very responsive here.\n. Yes please do.\n. Closing this as there's two new proposed implementations, #106 and #109.\n. Probably means your UA string\u2026 is not a string.\n. Question here is should we throw a clearer error here, or should we silently convert all input to strings. /cc @shripadk \n. Fixed in #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. We're dropping support for the is_mobile, is_spider, etc. stuff. Closing this.\n. Not sure how to best solve this without introducing the idea of a model / version number for devices, eg:\n{'is_spider': False, 'is_mobile': True, 'family': 'BlackBerry', model: '9320' }\n@elsigh ideas welcomed.\n. Related to #65.\n. Right, so I was looking for string to be equal, not using stristr.\nDoesn't that make the Playbook a mobile device too and break the current test suite?\n. The distinctions we're making between isMobile and isMobileDevice worries me, actually. It's awfully confusing.\nFor example, how do you categorize and iPod touch? is it a tablet or a mobile device?\nWhat about an iPad mini with 3G and Skype? is it a mobile device or a tablet?\nWhat's next? Whether the device is touch enabled or not?\nScreen size?\nHas a camera?\nEtc.\nWhen do we cross the line and fall into territory that belongs in a project like WURFL or the like? (Note that I think a good, open-source version of such a project would be awesome, it feels like its out of scope).\n/cc @elsigh\n. This is a massive can of worms. Think we should just stay out of it.\nOn inspection of the python code source I notice @elsigh is also doing strict equality comparisons with the mobile browser array.\n. So what should we do: just have a device object with a single, family property?\n. Closing. Decided to remove all boolean props from the JS version.\n. Duplicate of #66.\n. > If you want a client-side compatible JS version I released one a few months ago: https://github.com/darcyclarke/Detect.js\nCool.\n\nNoticed some things have changed/been added/fixed on the node.js version of this repo (originally was missing a fair number of things and had some weird js).\n\nYup. The first version concentrated solely on the stuff I needed at the time. I've bumped into some rather terse code in the first version, but nothing that felt weird (unless its the construct foo != null in place of your check function that bothered you).\n\nDetect.js's API is pretty much spot on to what has been done here for ua-parser (but will change slightly in v2). Going forward, I'll be hanging .name and .version strings off of the individual os, browser and device objects (instead of having to call .toString() or .toVersionString()). This may be something you guys will want to adopt.\n\nI'm worried that could be a performance issue. This code is meant to run server-side, possibly on every single request. This might me insignificant. but it might also not be so. I'd rather avoid it for now.\n\nAs well, I'm working on a node based build tool that will only include the regex profiles you want to keep the file size down (may also make a quick one page custom build page, similar to Modernizr's, available). Check out this branch if you're interested in that and the refactor: https://github.com/darcyclarke/Detect.js/tree/develop\n\nThere seems to be some interest to ship a JSON version of the YAML data in other ports then the JS one, so maybe a script that would do that would be a good first step.\n\nOverall, I may merge all this work back into the ua-parser project once I'm happy where it's at. I don't see any glaring differences anymore so there's not much point in duplicating efforts. Expect a PR in the next month or so with a few feature PRs. For now, if you're looking for a client-side version with the same, and a few more, capabilities, you can use Detect.\n\nPlease do send a PRs. Client-side support is certainly something I'd like to offer as it's been requested multiple times (and I'm not one to judge :P).\n. Closing this for now. \n. Afaik, the YAML parser does all of the necessary escaping for you. Also, if your reasoning was correct, pretty much no other regexp would work properly.\n. WFM. You must be doing something weird in your setup.\n. > I don't know how the YAML parser comes into picture here (what has the YAML parser got to do with regexes in the yaml file?\nIn YAML, \\ is only treated as an escape sequence between double quotes, not within single quotes (see spec). Hence '(rekonq)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+) Safari' in YAML is translated to the following JS: \"(rekonq)/(\\\\d+)\\\\.(\\\\d+) Safari\" which gets turned into the following regexp when passed to the Regexp constructor: /(rekonq)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+) Safari/ which is exactly what you want for this.\n. Superseded by #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. Superseded by #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. LGTM\n. @elsigh there's something I don't understand that's going on here related to 3dab0b5fee06d61f745cd7f75746d41caa1e2efd.\n. Think @elsigh already added some of it in there. Think you could rewrite your PHP code to use them?\nAlso, having pseudo code describing how to implement the algo directly in the YAML file would help.\n. Awesomeness.\n. Following the conversation on #75, I think we should just limit this data to just the device family and drop support for the rest. You're of course welcome to keep this in the PHP version.\n. @bluesmoon I'd like your advise on this. Adding parsing for the device and os as part of the same function adds a significant cost to this, and you were already worrying about perf implication earlier on. Is adding a function that does only UA parsing a good enough option in your book?\n. Looks like this is an issue with the python implementation.\n. Closing as dup of #134.\n. That wasn't really meant to be pulled, actually, rather discussed in the context of #75.\n. This is breaking the build: https://travis-ci.org/tobie/ua-parser/builds/3387965, so either the tests are incorrect and need fixing or this patch does.\n. Ping @stephenwalz. \n. The early (non Android-based)  kindles should keep their own OS.\n. Closing as duplicate of #133.\n. Here's the data I get when parsing this:\njson\n{\n  userAgent\": {\n    \"family\": \"IE\",\n    \"major\": \"10\",\n    \"minor\": \"0\",\n    \"patch\": null\n  },\n  \"os\": {\n    \"family\": \"Windows 8\",\n    \"major\": null,\n    \"minor\": null,\n    \"patch\": null,\n    \"patchMinor\": null\n  },\n  \"device\": {\n    \"family\": \"Other\"\n  }\n}\n. Still seeing the regexes.yaml file added in there.\nAre all the binary files here necessary? These look like external resources (but I have no idea how packaging is handled in c#.\n. Thanks. What about all the binaries?\n. > I intentionally didn't add binaries to git. I never do.\n\ndo you want it added or you're asking for binaries to make them available for downloading?\n\nI see the following binaries in the pull request, think @harryovers had added those initially.

Pull request here: #111.\nAll tests are still passing on node.js.\n. We're moving away from the is_mobile booleans. We can't precisely describe what a mobile device is.\n. I'd be in favor of this. In JS, the Device parser now only has one prop: family. Trying to define what is a mobile phone, a tablet is a nightmare (e.g. iPad with 3G vs iPod).\n. > 1: I've included unit tests of the yaml-defined testcases under test_resources\n\nbut I get one failing test on matching the useragent 'Mozilla/5.0 (BlackBerry;\nU; BlackBerry 9320; en-GB) AppleWebKit/534.11+ (KHTML, like Gecko)\nVersion/7.1.0.398 Mobile Safari/534.11+' as a mobile device. From running the\njava tests I see they have the same issue (seems the issue, at least for me\nand for the java version, is that the list of mobile OS'es are matched exactly\nagainst the family and BlackBerry 9320 != BlackBerry so the device is not\nmarked as mobile). Is this a known issue or is it just c#/java that suffer\nfrom this?\n\nWe should remove this data from the test files. Tracking in #114.\n\n2: I've added some Apache2 copyright and my name to the readme.\n\nPlease keep comments related to the pull request in the relevant issue. If this is a fork from the initial C# submission, please make sure the original author is credited.\n\nI'd like to\nsupport this going forward but how can I contribute and stay in the loop for\nupdates/fixes across the ported platforms?\n\nNot sure what you mean. GitHub notifications should allow you to follow along. Else the regexes file should update itself.\n\n3: As far as I can tell there is no Travis-CI support for C# which is too bad\nsince I'd like to integrate into some CI system. Any requirements/thoughts/\nideas on this from more experienced githubbers?\n\nNope. Sorry. Also, we'd need to split each language into a different project to allow for multiple language CI.\n\n4: I think @tobie has touched on this but c# is really not all that happy with\n_ (illegal escape) so I am currently just working around that and can remove\nthis if the regex'es are adjusted (not really a question come to think of it,\nmore of a reminder)\n\nPending PR in #111.\n. @enemaerke FYI, I fixed the regexp problem, so you no longer have to special case your implementation.\n. @elsigh are you ok with this?\n. OK, cool.\n. @dmolsen can I go ahead and remove this?\n. Indeed.\n. Merged.\n. @elsigh Feels like there's something fishy here where there are different path requirements wether the code is used bundled or via git clone.\n. The rest LGTM.\n. Could you provide example user agent strings where you're observing this problem, please?\n. Thanks. @elsigh, this seems to be by design. Can you explain your choices there? Seems it's hard to consider the \"7\" in \"Windows 7\" as a version number (given it comes after \"Windows Vista\" and \"Windows XP\").\n. OK. Cool. Lets fix this then.\n. Difficult to say without seeing some code.\nCan you give it your best guess and submit whatever you think makes most sense. We can always refine later.\nTechnically, if PR are always made against master, we shouldn't bump into merge conflicts.\n. /cc @elsigh: thoughts?\n. I'd love to see some of this included. Care to make a pull request?\n. PR with tests?\n. Would love to integrate this. However, the whole point of this is that everyone fork shares the same regexp file. Think you could make sure to use it rather than fork it?\n. Yup. Will do.\n. Done: 1f8d28c848f9949490815f104dbb233f356f9928.\n. This is because some of the regexes are case sensitive while others aren't.\n. I think we should all agree on one way of doing it, else we 're going to get lots of edge cases like this one. My preference would be to be case sensitive all the way (and thus do case sensitive matching inside the different ports too). @elsigh, thoughts?\n. Well, either way, we should go down one road and fix the rest of the regexes to comply, don't you think?\n. Looked into this a bit more. Here are the regexp strings (with matching line numbers) which don't contain mixed casing (so could be case insensitive.)  IMHO the first ones are false positives:\n77 '(luakit)'\n 93 'rekonq'\n102 '(konqueror)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)'\n129 '(chromeframe)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)'\n155 '(facebookexternalhit)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)'\n335 '(python-requests)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)'\n825 '(hiptop|avantgo|plucker|xiino|blazer|elaine|up.browser|up.link|mmp|smartphone|midp|wap|vodafone|o2|pocket|mobile|pda)'\n831 '^(1207|3gso|4thp|501i|502i|503i|504i|505i|506i|6310|6590|770s|802s|a wa|acer|acs\\-|airn|alav|asus|attw|au\\-m|aur |aus |abac|acoo|aiko|alco|alca|amoi|anex|anny|anyw|aptu|arch|argo|bell|bird|bw\\-n|bw\\-u|beck|benq|bilb|blac|c55/|cdm\\-|chtm|capi|comp|cond|craw|dall|dbte|dc\\-s|dica|ds\\-d|ds12|dait|devi|dmob|doco|dopo|el49|erk0|esl8|ez40|ez60|ez70|ezos|ezze|elai|emul|eric|ezwa|fake|fly\\-|fly_|g\\-mo|g1 u|g560|gf\\-5|grun|gene|go.w|good|grad|hcit|hd\\-m|hd\\-p|hd\\-t|hei\\-|hp i|hpip|hs\\-c|htc |htc\\-|htca|htcg)'\n833 '^(htcp|htcs|htct|htc_|haie|hita|huaw|hutc|i\\-20|i\\-go|i\\-ma|i230|iac|iac\\-|iac/|ig01|im1k|inno|iris|jata|java|kddi|kgt|kgt/|kpt |kwc\\-|klon|lexi|lg g|lg\\-a|lg\\-b|lg\\-c|lg\\-d|lg\\-f|lg\\-g|lg\\-k|lg\\-l|lg\\-m|lg\\-o|lg\\-p|lg\\-s|lg\\-t|lg\\-u|lg\\-w|lg/k|lg/l|lg/u|lg50|lg54|lge\\-|lge/|lynx|leno|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50/|maui|mc01|mc21|mcca|medi|meri|mio8|mioa|mo01|mo02|mode|modo|mot |mot\\-|mt50|mtp1|mtv |mate|maxo|merc|mits|mobi|motv|mozz|n100|n101|n102|n202|n203|n300|n302|n500|n502|n505|n700|n701|n710|nec\\-|nem\\-|newg|neon)'\n835 '^(netf|noki|nzph|o2 x|o2\\-x|opwv|owg1|opti|oran|ot\\-s|p800|pand|pg\\-1|pg\\-2|pg\\-3|pg\\-6|pg\\-8|pg\\-c|pg13|phil|pn\\-2|pt\\-g|palm|pana|pire|pock|pose|psio|qa\\-a|qc\\-2|qc\\-3|qc\\-5|qc\\-7|qc07|qc12|qc21|qc32|qc60|qci\\-|qwap|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|rove|s55/|sage|sams|sc01|sch\\-|scp\\-|sdk/|se47|sec\\-|sec0|sec1|semc|sgh\\-|shar|sie\\-|sk\\-0|sl45|slid|smb3|smt5|sp01|sph\\-|spv |spv\\-|sy01|samm|sany|sava|scoo|send|siem|smar|smit|soft|sony|t\\-mo|t218|t250|t600|t610|t618|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|telm|tim\\-|ts70|tsm\\-|tsm3|tsm5|tx\\-9|tagt)'\n837 '^(talk|teli|topl|tosh|up.b|upg1|utst|v400|v750|veri|vk\\-v|vk40|vk50|vk52|vk53|vm40|vx98|virg|vite|voda|vulc|w3c |w3c\\-|wapj|wapp|wapu|wapm|wig |wapi|wapr|wapv|wapy|wapa|waps|wapt|winc|winw|wonu|x700|xda2|xdag|yas\\-|your|zte\\-|zeto|aste|audi|avan|blaz|brew|brvw|bumb|ccwa|cell|cldc|cmd\\-|dang|eml2|fetc|hipt|http|ibro|idea|ikom|ipaq|jbro|jemu|jigs|keji|kyoc|kyok|libw|m\\-cr|midp|mmef|moto|mwbp|mywa|newt|nok6|o2im|pant|pdxg|play|pluc|port|prox|rozo|sama|seri|smal|symb|treo|upsi|vx52|vx53|vx60|vx61|vx70|vx80|vx81|vx83|vx85|wap\\-|webc|whit|wmlb|xda\\-|xda_)'\n843 '(bot|borg|google(^tv)|yahoo|slurp|msnbot|msrbot|openbot|archiver|netresearch|lycos|scooter|altavista|teoma|gigabot|baiduspider|blitzbot|oegp|charlotte|furlbot|http%20client|polybot|htdig|ichiro|mogimogi|larbin|pompos|scrubby|searchsight|seekbot|semanticdiscovery|silk|snappy|speedy|spider|voila|vortex|voyager|zao|zeal|fast\\-webcrawler|converacrawler|dataparksearch|findlinks)'\n. I'm considering this is strictly a regex case sensitivity issue and that only the last 6 regexes should be fixed (unless @elsigh advises otherwise). I'm opening a new issue for this task (#134) and assigning it to @dmolsen.\n. Kindle fire should be marked as Android-based indeed.\n. Closing as duplicate of #133\n. Looked into this. Agree the UA for this should read NetFront.\nMind submitting a test for this too?\n. Here's what I believe we need:\nNon Android OS:\nUA: NetFront \nDevice: Kindle\nOS: Kindle OS\nAndroid OS:\nUA: Amazon Silk\nDevice: Kindle Fire\nOS: Android OS\n. Fixed in #147 \n. Have you given http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/Mobile%20Browserlist/, http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/mobile_ids.html, and related a spin? This might help you out.\n. Defining what is or is not mobile is a perilous exercise. Are we talking size? Then what about an iPod? Are talking 3G access? Than what about an iPad mini? Are we talking about the ability to make calls? What about VoIP? Etc.\nIt turns out that what gets defined as mobile is use-case specific and so better sits on top of the data provided by the parser rather than as part of it.\n. Bump.\n. Thanks!\n. Bump.\n. I'm having issues merging this correctly. Rebased and cherry-picked the relevant commits in #147. LMK if there's issues with that.\n. NP. git rebase is your best friend.\n. We've remove the isMobile property as the ever-evolving landscape of devices made it more and more difficult to classify them in a meaningful way. What exactly defines a mobile device? Network access? Screen Size? Ability to make phone calls? Those questions only have meaningful answers within the context of a particular application, and so the classifying work is best left to the app itself or third party libraries that can sit on top of ua-parser.\n. This is none of my business as it's strictly about the PHP port, however I do think that providing users encouragements to use their own, patched regex files instead of contributing to the project really goes against the spirit of what we're trying to achieve here.\n. @pravindahal That use case makes a lot of sense. Thanks for clarifying.\n. These are two completely different features. Please split them up in two pull requests. Thanks!\n. OK, it seems you did submit two pull requests, but this one included both commits. The way to avoid this is to use a different branch for each one of those pull requests. As mentioned above, This one will also need tests to be accepted. Otherwise, this looks good and I'm looking forward to be able to pull it in. Thanks for your work!\n. Thanks @dmolsen. Think you can make a PR for this? Can we have something a bit more useful for the OS?\n. Sure.\n. Should be fixed in 56917913 if not, please reopen.\n. What are the benefits of these change given their obvious cost is a lot less readability?\n. Those unneeded variables and the wordiness are exactly what makes this piece of code more readable. Readability is always important, even in a one-liner. Given your changes don't improve anything (but removing trailing whitespace) and seriously hamper readability, I won't pull them in.\nI'm however happy to pull in a change which would only fix trailing whitespace.\n. Ideally we should base that on real data. @elsigh think you could get that from browserscope, for example?\n. Good point.\n. The goal here is to see if there's a lightweight way to organize this without compromising the data or making further updates complicated. Micro-changes to the regexp order will not have a significant impact on perf and we should not waste time on them. Eg. moving the IE regexp from position 100 to position 3 makes a lot of difference. From 3 to 2, not so much. :)\n. AFAIK, @3rd-Eden's suggestion is to order the regexp by most common UA first. I think that could make sense if it's kept reasonable and could yield substancial speed-ups on real world data.\n. You'll want to have a look at: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/py/ua_parser/user_agent_parser_test.py\n. Implementations do whatever they want as long as they pass the test suite.\n. Have you tried ordering you test data in alphabetical order (which should help tremendously with merges)?\n. I'm looking at sorting the files.\n. Thanks for the awesome work @dmolsen!\nJust a concern worth keeping in mind: how do adding all of these new browsers impact overall performance of the parser?\n. Could we have the fix, with the failing test case? ;-)\n. @elsigh we definitely need to make a better job explaining how this works. :) Yet, quoting from the README file:\n\nThe crux of the original parser--the data collected by Steve Souders over the years--has been extracted into a separate YAML file so as to be reusable as is by implementations in other programming languages.\n\nBasically, you just need to add the correct regexp (with proper bracketing) to the regexes.yaml and you should be done.\n. Fixed in #165.\n. Happy to merge this once these two issues are resolved.\n. This is hard to review. How do you know the two docs still contain the same data? how did you build this?\n. @elsigh for the record, travis builds run the JS tests on each PR, including this one: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/js/test/with_fixtures.js\n. @elsigh FYI: I have a massive set of tests coming up by the way (~16000 UA strings). Data made freely available by useragentstring.com. There's a number of tests we pass (roughly 5000) and a number we don't (the rest). I was planning to include the former in the testsuite directly, and then go through the other ones bit by bit (there are lots of low hanging fruits; a lot of the issues are to do with how we name a browser e.g. IE instead of Internet Explorer).\n. > another simple PHP script confirms that each file has the exact same number\n\nof and same string matches for the UA tests between your repo's test files\nand my fork's test files.\n\nBeautiful. I wanted to make sure we weren't accidentally loosing tests in\nthe process. This LGTM.\n. There's something weird with the display of Travis output. Not sure what exactly. Anyway, the issue is because the expected output is: \"Amaze 4G\" and the UA string contains the substring \"Amaze_4G\". You might need a dedicated device_replacement string if what you want is the former. For now, I would just modify the test so the expected output matches the input, and we can revisit once we tackle #144.\n. Thanks for those pull requests. Ideally, tests and code would be be in the same pull requests.\n. LGTM. Pulled. Thanks for writing this.\n. Hey @dmolsen, did we ever end-up making a decision on those issues? Feel like we should move forward with these so we can close this ticket.\n. Looked at how we handled that in the past, and you're right, we're just disregarding whatever's after patch. So let's continue doing this.\nWe still need to figure out what we do with non \\. separations. (eg here \"_\" and \"b\" in #194).\n. Hey @dmolsen, did we ever end-up making a decision on the above? Feel like we should move forward with these so we can close this ticket.\n. This should be fixed now.\n. Fixed in 656f407840ffa4c4ccbdd9922af0465c73135c89.\n. @piuccio: done:  https://npmjs.org/package/ua-parser\nSorry for letting that slip.\n. There are merge conflicts with this PR. Please rebase and submit again. Thanks! :)\n. Very confused by this commit which is claiming to fix a Java error and actually changing lots of tests in unclear ways.\nI can't pull this in in this state. Sorry.\n. Closing. @vsagar feel free to open again with response to my comments and clarification. Thanks.\n. Fixed in 656f407840ffa4c4ccbdd9922af0465c73135c89.\n. ua is always defined and is always an object. There previously was a bug where that wasn't the case, but this should have been fixed in the meantime.\n. If some of you need repo access to fix this, please LMK.\n. Happy to merge. Where's the PR?\n. @elsigh please way in, here. As I have no clue what these fine gentlemen are talking about. :)\n. > This also opens the issue of how projects like Detect.js can augment the knowledge from ua-parser. Like device classification (tablet/phone/etc).\nSo it really depends whether this info is subjective or objective. Objective info like device manufacturer, device model, etc. we'd love to integrate. Subjective info like device classification, not so much. We actually removed it because of overlap issues and corner cases (e.g.: what's defines \"mobile\"? Screensize? Ability to make calls? #g connection? Etc.).\nType info can be defined based on the output of the parser, so it doesn't need to be integrated into the YAML file. \n\nDo we have a recommended path for people to add metadata to the results from ua-parser?\n\nPull requests for objective data, output-based for the rest. I'd like to avoid having to add idetnfiers as much as possible.\n\nDetect.js includes things like device type and manufacturer on top of the forked regexes. If we can get those into the current YAML I'd be happy to incorporate a build step that pulls down and creates a JSON object from this centralized document of regex profiles.\n\nHappy to integrate the manufacturer info. The types not so much. Would you be able to reimplement types based on device.name info (if you really want to continue supporting type)?\nLonger term goals, I'd really like to turn this project in a GitHub org, and have the YAML file in its own repo so third parties can build on top of it more easily. Thoughts on the best model for that is welcomed.\n. If you want the manufacturers included, a PR with tests would be awesome. :D\n. We're reorganizing the project and splitting up the regexes into their own repos. Would love to see you contribute there. More discussions happening on the mailing list. Closing this in the meantime.\n. @elsigh not sure what's up here.\n. Seems no one is ready to work on this for now.\n. It could be a laptop too. It might also be a crawler. Hard to say.\n. Pull Request welcomed.\n. Ideally this needs a pull request and test.\n. @aselder the official test suite is the node.js one which is run on every commit and pull requests and consists of 13,111 tests. Master branch is always green or commits get reverted.\n. If you have node & npm & mocha installed, it should be as easy as running the following from the command line:\nmocha -u tdd ./js/test/*.js\n. Let me know if you have any issues.\n. @sjiang Can you please comment on the Java modifications?\n. Could you split-up the Python fix from the regex commit into two separate pull requests?\n. Yeah. We need to split up the projects.\n. Closing this. Will be resolved when moving to a JSON API.\n. Fixed in #230.\n. You might want to open a pull request and add them to this file:\nhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml\nTests are also important to get your pull request approved. They would go here:\nhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/test_resources/test_user_agent_parser.yaml\n. Can we close this?\n. That breaks a number of tests. Can you fix?\nThanks!\n. Closing as duplicate of #55. \n. This also needs tests.\n. This isn't passing the tests, also please add your query strings to the test databases.\n. Dup of #246.\n. Can't pull this as it is as it's failing the tests. Might mean some tests are wrong, in which case please fix them and explain your reasoning behind the fix.\nYou might have more success in getting things merged if you do more atomic commits (e.g. one per user agent fix).\n. Please open a new ticket per issue. Thanks.\n. Not until all tests pass, I'm afraid. I'll also ask you to clean it up and resubmit it as a single commit once that's done. I'd like to avoid polluting the tree with 15 commits with unclear messages.\n. Yes. Use a Git client on your own machine, pull the repository there, and push the changes back to your repo.\n. As I recommended earlier: please use a Git client, make your changes locally and submit them in atomic ready to be merged issues. I'd love to be able to include your contributions, but you really need to follow the contribution guidelines if you want me to be able to do so. I'm closing this for now hoping you'll be able to get your git client to work and submit new pull requests with one change (e.g. support for the AvantGo browser + related tests) per pull request (I suggest you create one branch per issue, all forked from the master branch).\n. You're welcome to send a PR for the guidelines too.\n. I'm open to the first part of your issue. SOmeone needs to do the work and combine it into something that is language agnostic.\nThe second part od your question is a red herring, there is no standard used across user agents that allows you to gather this data in a meaningful way. If it was the case, this whole project would be pointless and no one would have started it.\n. I don't. But I don't see what difference this would really make, as none of your chunks would gain meaning in the process.\n. What are the benefits of this approach? What are the drawbacks?\n. Sure, but can you easily express all the error routines in language agnostic way? How will you crowd-source those? Etc.\nAlso: http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/ :D\n. The way this project is structured makes it really easy to share the parser across a wide variety of computer languages (hence language agnostic). It also makes it very easy for folks to contribute to the project (crowd-source friendly).\n. It is also trivial to spoof the JS user agent string. :) Anyway, this thread has gone way off topic at this point. I'm going to close this and let you reopen an issue exclusively targeting your OSFamily request if you think there's value in that.\n. Thanks. Patch welcomed.\n. The 13K tests that ua-parser contains are run in ~2 seconds. Clearly the number of tests is not an issue at this point.\nI don't see any value in pruning the test files. Closing this as wontfix.\n. It is generally rather rare that we have to fix existing test cases. If so, it's still cheaper to do this on a case per case basis.\n. Please cleanup your repository of start from a fresh copy. Closing this as I won't be able to merge it.\n. You probably want to wipe our your GH fork and fork anew.\n. Could you provide a test for this? I was under the impression we had this covered already.\n. Beautiful. Thanks!\n. Thanks that's a bunch more readable. May I suggest you create a branch per pull request on your side? Should make things a lot easier.\n. > wouldnt making multiple branches cause the same problem as before when i made the branch for amigaos and it still pulled from the master branch.\nNo. You just need to make your branches from the untouched master branch.\n. > is there anything else needed for this to be merged?\nYes, please see my above comment in regexp.yaml.\n. This PR can't be merged. Please rebase it and reopen this issue once it's ready to be merged. Thanks!\n. A whole bunch of tests need to be updated apparently.\n. Get a better client or use the command line. That's unheard of.\n. Yes. Please address my above comment about regexp readability.\n. Yes please. :)\n. What is this patch fixing?\n. Will need tests to be fixed.\n. @philipzae can you please try to bundle commits together as much as possible? 3-5 commits for a single change pollutes the revision history and makes backing out of problematic commits much more complicated then needed.\n. Well, in that case, please fix your client before continuing your contributions. Thanks.\n. The fact that you're working from the Web client shouldn't prevent you from giving helpful names to commits. I thank you for your contributions but kindly ask you to be a good citizen and adere to good coding practices and respect contribution guidelines. Thanks.\n. Please change the commit \"title\" (first line). That's the key part. (Hadn't even noticed the \"description\" as this is a GH concept, not a Git one.) \nThanks!\n. git commit --amend is your friend. ;)\n. There are merge conflicts here, unfortunately.\nCan you please fix?\n. I don't know. You might want to close this PR and open a new one if you can't figure this out.\n. Thanks!\n. That's awesome! Could you add tests?\n. There are YAML files in /test_resources.\n. Have you tried rebasing after pulling a recent master?\n. Yes, sorry. You're rebasing from your own GitHub account. You want to rebase from mine. To do so, add it as a remote ($ git remote add main git@github.com:tobie/ua-parser.git), fetch it ($ git fetch main) then rebase from there ($ git rebase main/master HbbTV).\n. No problem. Closing. Obsoleted by #286.\n. Fixed in fa7003f3\n. Awesome. Thanks a bunch!\nCan you please update the main README with details of your port (create a new usage section, add yourself as a maintainer of this part, and add the licensing terms for the port too).\nThanks again.\n. just follow the terms of the license precisely:\n- http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#redistribution for regexes.yaml\n- https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/php/LICENSE for the PHP code.\n. Could you please add tests for this?\n. @commenthol could you please rebase this PR now that I've accepted @jpvincent's patch? (I had missed yours previously).\nWould also like @elsigh's input on the branding changes (iPad --> Apple iPad).\n. Looking at your other PR (#284), and the brand issue you bring up here, we might want to change what the device object contains, maybe to something like:\ndevice.brand // => \"Nokia\"\ndevice.family // => \"Lumia\"\ndevice.model // => \"505\"\nThoughts?\n. > But we've been inconsistent here right?\nYeah, we've consistently been inconsistent.\nGiven that, I'm not sure what the best strategy going forward is, tbh.\n. There's a tremendous amount of noise due to whitespace issues in your diff. Think you could fix that?\n. @mamod think travis now supports multiple languages. Think it would be worthwhile adding your travis build here? In which case this PR could happen here.\n@commenthol think we should have separate PR, here, too. This is going to get ugly quickly if not.\n. Great stuff overall. The \"multiple replacement placeholder\" stuff needs to be brought up a bit more globally so that all implementations can use it.\nWhat's the backwards compat story, here?\n. Any news?\n. The Travis build is failing right now, so the first step would be to fix that.\n. /cc @elsigh ^\n. @elsigh agree this commit is awesome.\nConcerned with updates of ports besides JS, python, and perl, though\nWhat's the story here? How should we handle that (this time and in the future)?\n. > I don't know how many of our langs are supported by travis, but that the more we can have all of the parsers run the same tests the better. If all the langs were running through Travis it does place quite a burden on anyone who wants a new feature to put it in everywhere, but I'd be ok with that.\nAgreed.\n\nFor this case I'm not that concerned here about new functionality in the device parser, as opposed to say the UA parser. But it would be nice to get a note out to all the other maintainers at a minimum.\n\nThat sounds good. We need a channel to do that, though. Any suggestions?\n\nThen again, if we had a single page/file that outlines the spec of the parser everyone could subscribe to that and we could approve changes to that file before changes to any/all langs.\n\n[snip]\n\nRight now we just have a little section for each language but not an overall spec..\n\nThat's also a great idea. Should we get started?\n. That looks like a good start. I'll try to find time to review this by EOW. Thanks for your work on this!\n. I completely dropped the ball on this one. Sorry.\nCc: @enemaerke, @shripadk, @yihuanz, @ozataman, @sjiang, @mamod, @dmolsen, @nielsbasjes, @elsigh\nFolks,\nI'd like for us to be able to move forward with this PR. For this I'd like feedback by the November 1st from you all on whether you're intending to implement the changes in your language port or not, and ideally an estimated timeframe in which you will be ready to release an updated version.\n@commenthol, I really like you early spec draft. I suggest you create a separate PR for it so we can pull it in and work on it in the meantime. I've also given you commit rights to the repo, please handle this right responsibly. ;)\nThanks.\n--tobie\n. As a sidenote, wouldn't device.manufacturer make more sense then device.brand?\n. > Therefore I would like to stick with \"brand\" in order to be able to solve those cases.\nMakes sense.\n. > my nexus 4 says LG on the back.\nThis is going to be fun!\n. Haven't heard back from a bunch of you. I guess the only reasonable strategy there will be to mark as obsolete (and or remove?) these implementation from the project.\nOverall, it might be worthwhile to reconsider how to best organize this project.\n. Create a new issue (#304) to discuss this further.\n. Likewise. Should have more time for this starting early August.\n. Looks like you have an issue with the python port not implementing os_v1_replacement--hence the travis build fail. @elsigh can you chime in, here? What's the plan?\n. > Hrm, it looks like OSParser has os_v1_replacement actually..\nMy bad, looked in the wrong place. Sorry.\n. Merged #287. Restarted the travis build which should now pass.\n. LGTM. Merging.\n. In the future, please rebase master instead of merging it (less commit noise).\n. What makes you think the test is a fault here, rather than the Java implementation?\n. Looking at this a bit more in detail, it's clear to me that the issue is with the Java implementation (which doesn't handle os_v2_replacement properly.) Android Donut is == to version 1.2, not version 1.\nClosing this as wontfix.\nIMHO the issue is with the lack/partial support for os_v2_replacement in the Java implementation.\n. > I wasn't claiming that there's a problem with tests, but if the test are failing under Java, then I think this should be fixed one way (changes to tests, that didn't work under Java when added) or other (changes to Java implementation).\nAgreed this should be fixed. But this should be fixed the correct way. Turns out the tests are correct and the Java implementation isn't. Therefore the implementation needs fixing.\n\nI can suggest that probably easiest way to fix that would be to remove that that test case from Java's version of tests, if that's OK.\n\nThat's not possible, unfortunately. The tests are shared across implementations.\n. Test cases would be awesome!\n. You have a bunch of tests failing, some which are to do with how YAML distinguishes null from undefined.\nCould you please fix those?\n. Yeah, I had the same reaction. Are these two different browsers or the same browser on two different platforms?\n. It sounds like we should treat as IEMobile, then, and identify the device through the device parser, no?\n. Please reopen once you've fixed the failing test cases. Thanks!\n. Pull request welcomed.\n. LGTM\n. Think it would be great to add a section that recommends a JSON structure for the output of the parser that implementations are supposed to stay close to.\n. Closing this as it's already been merged in the new repo.\n. Not sure I understand the goal (goals?) of this PR. Could you elaborate.\n. OK, I guess, I need to try it out to really understand.\n. That what as smart move. Thanks!\n. Please rebase your change from the current master. There's about 15 unrelated commits in here.\n. We're integrating these changes in the new repository:\nhttps://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core\n. We're splitting up devices into brand, family and model. See #285.\n. I'd actually favor smaller incremental PR. Getting agreement, reviewing massive PR like #285 is a slow process.\n. Thanks for your suggestion @commenthol.\nThere's are two things about it that bother me:\n1. I want ports to each have their own repository, whether they're part of the ua-parser GitHub org or not.\n2. splitting up copies of regexes across files and folders is utterly wrong. It's basically re-inventing versioning, but making us do it by hand. Accepting contributions would be terrible, merging stuff atrocious and will bump into issue were previous versions get fixed but not new ones, etc.\nThe only reasonable choice to serve different version of the regex is to tag versions in GitHub, then have a open-source friendly host (e.g. nodejitsu) serve all of the differently tagged versions.\n. Yeah. That's the path I'm looking at. \n. Started some action here: https://github.com/ua-parser\n. Lack of time. :-(\n. Closing this. See you in the mailing list, irc, or on https://github.com/ua-parser/ua-parser.github.io/issues.\n. Cool. I don't think I've seen you chime in on #285. Can you?\n. Closing this given a conversation on perf is starting on the mailing list.\n. I don't think possible values are a closed set, actually. But I might be wrong. I'd love to include a script that would gather this data from the YAML into the repo itself if you're so inclined, @BradRuderman.\n. Done. Thanks for your help so far @dmolsen!\n. Sorry, I though you were planning to finish the TODOs before getting this pulled in.\nThis LGTM but needs addition to the main README file. I'll pull as soon as that's ready.\n. Sorry for the huge delay in pulling this. :(\n. Closing this as wontfix (as explained in #75)\n. This is not passing a number of tests: https://travis-ci.org/tobie/ua-parser/builds/16018472.\n. Please reopen this PR once you've fixed the failing tests. Thanks!\n. Ya, sorry folks. This project is in urgent need of an overhaul in order to\nsimplify this issue. Sorry this has been delayed.

E.g. does this project want to have details of a device \"mobile/tablet/desktop\" as proposed in #428 or doesn't it as stated in #75?\n\n\nI'm keeping to my initial position here. As explained on both #428 (which I just closed) and in previous occasions.\n\n\nDo we want to get seperate parser-rules for browser engines as proposed by #241?\n\n\nI'm fine with that, but it should happen after we ship the split-up version of ua-parser.\n\n\nOrder of priority: Is performance more important than the detailed detection of a UA?\n\n\nThat's a good question. I think that the work @Ironholds will be leading here should allow us to keep our cake and eat it too. If the regexes are sorted, we can pretty much have both.\n\nIs working on performance, which inevitable involves a change of parser semantics, a project goal?\n\nKey goal here is to make this project easy to contribute to and easy to use in different languages.\n. Yeah. This is not a client-side tool. Legitimate client-side usecases are seldom, tbh. \n. Current repo is here: https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-java. Closing.\n. Dup of ua-parser/uap-core#131.\n. > Looks like the travis build is failing @tobie ; shall I update your travis config file as well?\nThat would be awesome, @russellwhitaker, though I have no idea what it does at this point.. Looks like there are slight changes in the way the JSON object is structured which aren't compatible with current code. I look at this over the week-end.\n. The property names are all wrong. Maybe they were different earlier. Maybe I manually changed them at some point (possible but super dumb if I did). Either way, it's a simple fix. Just want to run it before I push it.\n. Cherry-picked and pushed to master along with code fix. Bumped version number and pushed to npm registry: http://search.npmjs.org/#/ua-parser.\n. Well, it used to be a JSON file. :(\nI'd rather leave the canonical file where it is and switch to a YAML parser.\n. Fair point.\nFlying out back home today. Let me look at this over the week-end.\n. Mmm. Good point about the version numbers not necessarily being ints. Mind opening another issue about that?\n. Added a script to pull and parse upstream changes directly. Ran it and merged these changes. Closing.\n. The main reason why I actually added support for this was to able to do simple comparison between versions. Note sure how to handle that one. Thoughts?\n. Good point. Although NPM modules follow semver. Browsers don't.\n. For reference, semver's a package of it's own: https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver. Wondering how the upstream branch is handling this.\n. Fixed in #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. Thanks, cherry-picked the last one and pushed.\n. Can you remove the .svn dir that's in there, or is there a reason to keep it?\n. Standardizing on a attribut names is fine. It's also easy to keep the previous ones around for backwards compat purposes.\nI don't have a strong feeling about your second point other than that it shouldn't delay merging the projects.\n. The JS parser does support v1 and v2, it just calls them minor and patch (after SemVer).\n. Closing this and opening separate issues for what still needs to get done.\n. @dmolsen you can, just push them to separate branches.\n. @elsigh asigned that to you as you seem the most appropriate person to review @dmolsen's changes.\nI'm fine modifying the js code to point to whichever file we decide to keep after this.\n. OK, didn't know the history behind that. Is this something you want to do in the YAML regexes or in the Python code directly?\n. Awesome. You do the work. I benefit. I like that. :)\n. Sure. But why does it need write access?\n. LGTM.\n. Still unsure why the Ruby Gem couldn't be in the same folder, BTW.\n. Your second point seems a valid one. #1and #3 are red herrings, however.\nThat said, I'm myself in favor of creating an organization and\nsplitting the repo up, just haven't had the time to look into it nor\nto discuss naming with @elsigh.\n. Happy to include a link to other implementations in the main README.\n. @LeoColomb I'd like to make the move but want a clear strategy on how to share the regexp across repos. Eager to hear your proposal and submit it to @elsigh and @dmolsen.\n. What bothers me with this strategy is all projects need to actively upgrade everytime there's a change to the YAML.\n. That doesn't really address my concern. :(\n. For the ruby lib? Sure. Lets do this. Mind sending a PR?\n. Closing this as no one seems interested to build this.\n. Not sure, if not, patch, please. :)\n. Awesome. Thanks for your work.\nThis will need a license type before it gets pulled in.\nAlso wondering if there isn't value in adding a facade-like pattern for the most common use case (parse the UA string, get an object back). But you might disagree (and that's OK :-)).\n. LGTM. @elsigh can you confirm that [A-z] was intended as [A-Za-z]?\n. LGTM except for the fact that I have no clue how to read Haskell, and that it's missing a README (I know you know) and a code example in the main README.\n. Really thankful for the contribution, btw. It's great to se this project shaping up like this.\n. Any idea on when you can make those fixes? Would love to merge this PR.\n. Happy to merge a change that fixes the regexes stored here: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml\nI don't have the time to look into it myself atm.\n. LGTM. @elsigh can you vet this on the regexp side?\n. Bump, /cc @ozataman \n. NP. Wanted to pull your changes in nonetheless. Openend issues so this does't get forgotten.\n. Bump, /cc @ozataman\n. Fixed in #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. Can we please split up diffs for regexes.yaml from everything else?\nFine for merging that part. The rest of the JS changes I'd like to review separately. I'm not fond of the bitwise operator trick, unless there are proven performance benefits in what's cleary a bottleneck of the code.\nFurthermore, @bluesmoon mentioned in #5 that version numbers should be presented as strings (and not ints) as we're sometimes loosing info in the process of parsing these.\nI welcome a proposition of how to go about changing this to ship it in a 0.3 version.\nMakes sense?\n. Not sure what's best. Would like input from @bluesmoon as he reported the issue initially.\n. semver comparison only works reliably when the version strings are conformant to then  Semver spec.\nWhat are the ports in the other languages doing? Strings or ints?\nWhat about providing both?\n. There's too much different things going on in this PR for it to be pulled directly.\nHappy to consider some more atomic changes.\n. Commented in lots of places. Overall, would like to see this PR split up in 2-3 chunks taregting one thing only unless there's a compelling reason not to do so.\n. Sounds good. I'm wary of backwards compatibility issues, can you suggest a more elegant API which would allow us to do both?\n. No, we can't extend the language like that in a lib. It's a Very Bad Practice(TM).\n. Can we please split this up. One feature per PR. Thanks.\n. Slightly confused here. What we thought was the browser version is in fact the OS version?\nAlso, Netfront is the browser name, or the rendering engine name? (Seems the former, but browser engine is a synonym of rendering engine, so\u2026).\n. Why would you want to silence this error?\n. Can't this be done without backwards compat issues?\n. Really? Can't you memoize the YAML the first time it's parsed an use it from then on without modifying the API?\nSeems just checking for self::$regexes before fetching the YAML file should do the trick.\n. Your last option is of course to make the changes but make UA::parse() instantiate and hold on to a an instance of itself for backwards compatibility.\n. Keeping backwards compatibility is a great reason to slightly dirty the code. If for some reason, you don't want your class to have both static methods and be instantiable, just create another class for the instantiable part. The key here is that there is absolutely no reason to break backwards compat, so let's not do it. When you have lots of people relying on your code, breaking backwards compat when it is not absolutely necessary is the last thing you want to do.\n. Looks like a regression. Can you make a patch?\n. Pull request anyone?\n. Please split that up in smaller chunks with 1 PR == 1 feature. Thanks.\n. Closing. Duplicate of #78\n. /cc @elsigh \n. Awesome. Happy to merge this as soon as you've figured out a way to avoid needing a duplicate of the YAML file.\n. Ping @harryovers. Any updates? Would love to include this.\n. Bump @harryovers.\n. Bump @harryovers. Would love to include this. Have you managed to make the required changes?\n. @galmeida would you be interested in making the requested changes to the patch (and possibly doing some support for it)? @harryovers hasn't been very responsive here.\n. Yes please do.\n. Closing this as there's two new proposed implementations, #106 and #109.\n. Probably means your UA string\u2026 is not a string.\n. Question here is should we throw a clearer error here, or should we silently convert all input to strings. /cc @shripadk \n. Fixed in #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. We're dropping support for the is_mobile, is_spider, etc. stuff. Closing this.\n. Not sure how to best solve this without introducing the idea of a model / version number for devices, eg:\n{'is_spider': False, 'is_mobile': True, 'family': 'BlackBerry', model: '9320' }\n@elsigh ideas welcomed.\n. Related to #65.\n. Right, so I was looking for string to be equal, not using stristr.\nDoesn't that make the Playbook a mobile device too and break the current test suite?\n. The distinctions we're making between isMobile and isMobileDevice worries me, actually. It's awfully confusing.\nFor example, how do you categorize and iPod touch? is it a tablet or a mobile device?\nWhat about an iPad mini with 3G and Skype? is it a mobile device or a tablet?\nWhat's next? Whether the device is touch enabled or not?\nScreen size?\nHas a camera?\nEtc.\nWhen do we cross the line and fall into territory that belongs in a project like WURFL or the like? (Note that I think a good, open-source version of such a project would be awesome, it feels like its out of scope).\n/cc @elsigh\n. This is a massive can of worms. Think we should just stay out of it.\nOn inspection of the python code source I notice @elsigh is also doing strict equality comparisons with the mobile browser array.\n. So what should we do: just have a device object with a single, family property?\n. Closing. Decided to remove all boolean props from the JS version.\n. Duplicate of #66.\n. > If you want a client-side compatible JS version I released one a few months ago: https://github.com/darcyclarke/Detect.js\nCool.\n\nNoticed some things have changed/been added/fixed on the node.js version of this repo (originally was missing a fair number of things and had some weird js).\n\nYup. The first version concentrated solely on the stuff I needed at the time. I've bumped into some rather terse code in the first version, but nothing that felt weird (unless its the construct foo != null in place of your check function that bothered you).\n\nDetect.js's API is pretty much spot on to what has been done here for ua-parser (but will change slightly in v2). Going forward, I'll be hanging .name and .version strings off of the individual os, browser and device objects (instead of having to call .toString() or .toVersionString()). This may be something you guys will want to adopt.\n\nI'm worried that could be a performance issue. This code is meant to run server-side, possibly on every single request. This might me insignificant. but it might also not be so. I'd rather avoid it for now.\n\nAs well, I'm working on a node based build tool that will only include the regex profiles you want to keep the file size down (may also make a quick one page custom build page, similar to Modernizr's, available). Check out this branch if you're interested in that and the refactor: https://github.com/darcyclarke/Detect.js/tree/develop\n\nThere seems to be some interest to ship a JSON version of the YAML data in other ports then the JS one, so maybe a script that would do that would be a good first step.\n\nOverall, I may merge all this work back into the ua-parser project once I'm happy where it's at. I don't see any glaring differences anymore so there's not much point in duplicating efforts. Expect a PR in the next month or so with a few feature PRs. For now, if you're looking for a client-side version with the same, and a few more, capabilities, you can use Detect.\n\nPlease do send a PRs. Client-side support is certainly something I'd like to offer as it's been requested multiple times (and I'm not one to judge :P).\n. Closing this for now. \n. Afaik, the YAML parser does all of the necessary escaping for you. Also, if your reasoning was correct, pretty much no other regexp would work properly.\n. WFM. You must be doing something weird in your setup.\n. > I don't know how the YAML parser comes into picture here (what has the YAML parser got to do with regexes in the yaml file?\nIn YAML, \\ is only treated as an escape sequence between double quotes, not within single quotes (see spec). Hence '(rekonq)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+) Safari' in YAML is translated to the following JS: \"(rekonq)/(\\\\d+)\\\\.(\\\\d+) Safari\" which gets turned into the following regexp when passed to the Regexp constructor: /(rekonq)/(\\d+)\\.(\\d+) Safari/ which is exactly what you want for this.\n. Superseded by #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. Superseded by #91 which I'd love your feedback on.\n. LGTM\n. @elsigh there's something I don't understand that's going on here related to 3dab0b5fee06d61f745cd7f75746d41caa1e2efd.\n. Think @elsigh already added some of it in there. Think you could rewrite your PHP code to use them?\nAlso, having pseudo code describing how to implement the algo directly in the YAML file would help.\n. Awesomeness.\n. Following the conversation on #75, I think we should just limit this data to just the device family and drop support for the rest. You're of course welcome to keep this in the PHP version.\n. @bluesmoon I'd like your advise on this. Adding parsing for the device and os as part of the same function adds a significant cost to this, and you were already worrying about perf implication earlier on. Is adding a function that does only UA parsing a good enough option in your book?\n. Looks like this is an issue with the python implementation.\n. Closing as dup of #134.\n. That wasn't really meant to be pulled, actually, rather discussed in the context of #75.\n. This is breaking the build: https://travis-ci.org/tobie/ua-parser/builds/3387965, so either the tests are incorrect and need fixing or this patch does.\n. Ping @stephenwalz. \n.

Pull request here: #111.\nAll tests are still passing on node.js.\n. We're moving away from the is_mobile booleans. We can't precisely describe what a mobile device is.\n. I'd be in favor of this. In JS, the Device parser now only has one prop: family. Trying to define what is a mobile phone, a tablet is a nightmare (e.g. iPad with 3G vs iPod).\n. > 1: I've included unit tests of the yaml-defined testcases under test_resources\n\nbut I get one failing test on matching the useragent 'Mozilla/5.0 (BlackBerry;\nU; BlackBerry 9320; en-GB) AppleWebKit/534.11+ (KHTML, like Gecko)\nVersion/7.1.0.398 Mobile Safari/534.11+' as a mobile device. From running the\njava tests I see they have the same issue (seems the issue, at least for me\nand for the java version, is that the list of mobile OS'es are matched exactly\nagainst the family and BlackBerry 9320 != BlackBerry so the device is not\nmarked as mobile).

OK, cool.\n. @dmolsen can I go ahead and remove this?\n. Indeed.\n. Merged.\n. @elsigh Feels like there's something fishy here where there are different path requirements wether the code is used bundled or via git clone.\n. The rest LGTM.\n. Could you provide example user agent strings where you're observing this problem, please?\n. Thanks. @elsigh, this seems to be by design. Can you explain your choices there? Seems it's hard to consider the \"7\" in \"Windows 7\" as a version number (given it comes after \"Windows Vista\" and \"Windows XP\").\n. OK. Cool. Lets fix this then.\n. Difficult to say without seeing some code.\nCan you give it your best guess and submit whatever you think makes most sense. We can always refine later.\nTechnically, if PR are always made against master, we shouldn't bump into merge conflicts.\n. /cc @elsigh: thoughts?\n. I'd love to see some of this included. Care to make a pull request?\n. PR with tests?\n. Would love to integrate this. However, the whole point of this is that everyone fork shares the same regexp file. Think you could make sure to use it rather than fork it?\n. Yup. Will do.\n. Done: 1f8d28c848f9949490815f104dbb233f356f9928.\n. This is because some of the regexes are case sensitive while others aren't.\n. I think we should all agree on one way of doing it, else we 're going to get lots of edge cases like this one. My preference would be to be case sensitive all the way (and thus do case sensitive matching inside the different ports too). @elsigh, thoughts?\n. Well, either way, we should go down one road and fix the rest of the regexes to comply, don't you think?\n. Looked into this a bit more. Here are the regexp strings (with matching line numbers) which don't contain mixed casing (so could be case insensitive.)

Here's what I believe we need:\nNon Android OS:\nUA: NetFront \nDevice: Kindle\nOS: Kindle OS\nAndroid OS:\nUA: Amazon Silk\nDevice: Kindle Fire\nOS: Android OS\n. Fixed in #147 \n. Have you given http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/Mobile%20Browserlist/, http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/mobile_ids.html, and related a spin? This might help you out.\n. Defining what is or is not mobile is a perilous exercise. Are we talking size? Then what about an iPod? Are talking 3G access? Than what about an iPad mini? Are we talking about the ability to make calls? What about VoIP? Etc.\nIt turns out that what gets defined as mobile is use-case specific and so better sits on top of the data provided by the parser rather than as part of it.\n. Bump.\n. Thanks!\n. Bump.\n. I'm having issues merging this correctly. Rebased and cherry-picked the relevant commits in #147. LMK if there's issues with that.\n. NP. git rebase is your best friend.\n. We've remove the isMobile property as the ever-evolving landscape of devices made it more and more difficult to classify them in a meaningful way. What exactly defines a mobile device? Network access? Screen Size? Ability to make phone calls? Those questions only have meaningful answers within the context of a particular application, and so the classifying work is best left to the app itself or third party libraries that can sit on top of ua-parser.\n. This is none of my business as it's strictly about the PHP port, however I do think that providing users encouragements to use their own, patched regex files instead of contributing to the project really goes against the spirit of what we're trying to achieve here.\n. @pravindahal That use case makes a lot of sense. Thanks for clarifying.\n. These are two completely different features. Please split them up in two pull requests. Thanks!\n. OK, it seems you did submit two pull requests, but this one included both commits. The way to avoid this is to use a different branch for each one of those pull requests. As mentioned above, This one will also need tests to be accepted. Otherwise, this looks good and I'm looking forward to be able to pull it in. Thanks for your work!\n. Thanks @dmolsen. Think you can make a PR for this? Can we have something a bit more useful for the OS?\n. Sure.\n. Should be fixed in 56917913 if not, please reopen.\n. What are the benefits of these change given their obvious cost is a lot less readability?\n. Those unneeded variables and the wordiness are exactly what makes this piece of code more readable. Readability is always important, even in a one-liner. Given your changes don't improve anything (but removing trailing whitespace) and seriously hamper readability, I won't pull them in.\nI'm however happy to pull in a change which would only fix trailing whitespace.\n. Ideally we should base that on real data. @elsigh think you could get that from browserscope, for example?\n. Good point.\n. The goal here is to see if there's a lightweight way to organize this without compromising the data or making further updates complicated. Micro-changes to the regexp order will not have a significant impact on perf and we should not waste time on them. Eg. moving the IE regexp from position 100 to position 3 makes a lot of difference. From 3 to 2, not so much. :)\n. AFAIK, @3rd-Eden's suggestion is to order the regexp by most common UA first. I think that could make sense if it's kept reasonable and could yield substancial speed-ups on real world data.\n. You'll want to have a look at: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/py/ua_parser/user_agent_parser_test.py\n. Implementations do whatever they want as long as they pass the test suite.\n. Have you tried ordering you test data in alphabetical order (which should help tremendously with merges)?\n. I'm looking at sorting the files.\n. Thanks for the awesome work @dmolsen!\nJust a concern worth keeping in mind: how do adding all of these new browsers impact overall performance of the parser?\n. Could we have the fix, with the failing test case? ;-)\n. @elsigh we definitely need to make a better job explaining how this works. :) Yet, quoting from the README file:\n\nThe crux of the original parser--the data collected by Steve Souders over the years--has been extracted into a separate YAML file so as to be reusable as is by implementations in other programming languages.\n\nBasically, you just need to add the correct regexp (with proper bracketing) to the regexes.yaml and you should be done.\n. Fixed in #165.\n. Happy to merge this once these two issues are resolved.\n. This is hard to review. How do you know the two docs still contain the same data? how did you build this?\n. @elsigh for the record, travis builds run the JS tests on each PR, including this one: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/js/test/with_fixtures.js\n. @elsigh FYI: I have a massive set of tests coming up by the way (~16000 UA strings). Data made freely available by useragentstring.com. There's a number of tests we pass (roughly 5000) and a number we don't (the rest). I was planning to include the former in the testsuite directly, and then go through the other ones bit by bit (there are lots of low hanging fruits; a lot of the issues are to do with how we name a browser e.g. IE instead of Internet Explorer).\n. > another simple PHP script confirms that each file has the exact same number\n\nof and same string matches for the UA tests between your repo's test files\nand my fork's test files.\n\nBeautiful. I wanted to make sure we weren't accidentally loosing tests in\nthe process. This LGTM.\n. There's something weird with the display of Travis output. Not sure what exactly. Anyway, the issue is because the expected output is: \"Amaze 4G\" and the UA string contains the substring \"Amaze_4G\". You might need a dedicated device_replacement string if what you want is the former. For now, I would just modify the test so the expected output matches the input, and we can revisit once we tackle #144.\n. Thanks for those pull requests. Ideally, tests and code would be be in the same pull requests.\n. LGTM. Pulled. Thanks for writing this.\n. Hey @dmolsen, did we ever end-up making a decision on those issues? Feel like we should move forward with these so we can close this ticket.\n. Looked at how we handled that in the past, and you're right, we're just disregarding whatever's after patch. So let's continue doing this.\nWe still need to figure out what we do with non \\. separations. (eg here \"_\" and \"b\" in #194).\n. Hey @dmolsen, did we ever end-up making a decision on the above? Feel like we should move forward with these so we can close this ticket.\n. This should be fixed now.\n. Fixed in 656f407840ffa4c4ccbdd9922af0465c73135c89.\n. @piuccio: done:  https://npmjs.org/package/ua-parser\nSorry for letting that slip.\n. There are merge conflicts with this PR. Please rebase and submit again. Thanks! :)\n. Very confused by this commit which is claiming to fix a Java error and actually changing lots of tests in unclear ways.\nI can't pull this in in this state. Sorry.\n. Closing. @vsagar feel free to open again with response to my comments and clarification. Thanks.\n. Fixed in 656f407840ffa4c4ccbdd9922af0465c73135c89.\n. ua is always defined and is always an object. There previously was a bug where that wasn't the case, but this should have been fixed in the meantime.\n. If some of you need repo access to fix this, please LMK.\n. Happy to merge. Where's the PR?\n. @elsigh please way in, here. As I have no clue what these fine gentlemen are talking about. :)\n. > This also opens the issue of how projects like Detect.js can augment the knowledge from ua-parser. Like device classification (tablet/phone/etc).\nSo it really depends whether this info is subjective or objective. Objective info like device manufacturer, device model, etc. we'd love to integrate. Subjective info like device classification, not so much. We actually removed it because of overlap issues and corner cases (e.g.: what's defines \"mobile\"? Screensize? Ability to make calls? #g connection? Etc.).\nType info can be defined based on the output of the parser, so it doesn't need to be integrated into the YAML file. \n\nDo we have a recommended path for people to add metadata to the results from ua-parser?\n\nPull requests for objective data, output-based for the rest. I'd like to avoid having to add idetnfiers as much as possible.\n\nDetect.js includes things like device type and manufacturer on top of the forked regexes. If we can get those into the current YAML I'd be happy to incorporate a build step that pulls down and creates a JSON object from this centralized document of regex profiles.\n\nHappy to integrate the manufacturer info. The types not so much. Would you be able to reimplement types based on device.name info (if you really want to continue supporting type)?\nLonger term goals, I'd really like to turn this project in a GitHub org, and have the YAML file in its own repo so third parties can build on top of it more easily. Thoughts on the best model for that is welcomed.\n. If you want the manufacturers included, a PR with tests would be awesome. :D\n. We're reorganizing the project and splitting up the regexes into their own repos. Would love to see you contribute there. More discussions happening on the mailing list. Closing this in the meantime.\n. @elsigh not sure what's up here.\n. Seems no one is ready to work on this for now.\n. It could be a laptop too. It might also be a crawler. Hard to say.\n. Pull Request welcomed.\n. Ideally this needs a pull request and test.\n. @aselder the official test suite is the node.js one which is run on every commit and pull requests and consists of 13,111 tests. Master branch is always green or commits get reverted.\n. If you have node & npm & mocha installed, it should be as easy as running the following from the command line:\nmocha -u tdd ./js/test/*.js\n. Let me know if you have any issues.\n. @sjiang Can you please comment on the Java modifications?\n. Could you split-up the Python fix from the regex commit into two separate pull requests?\n. Yeah. We need to split up the projects.\n. Closing this. Will be resolved when moving to a JSON API.\n. Fixed in #230.\n. You might want to open a pull request and add them to this file:\nhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml\nTests are also important to get your pull request approved. They would go here:\nhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/test_resources/test_user_agent_parser.yaml\n. Can we close this?\n. That breaks a number of tests. Can you fix?\nThanks!\n. Closing as duplicate of #55. \n. This also needs tests.\n. This isn't passing the tests, also please add your query strings to the test databases.\n. Dup of #246.\n. Can't pull this as it is as it's failing the tests. Might mean some tests are wrong, in which case please fix them and explain your reasoning behind the fix.\nYou might have more success in getting things merged if you do more atomic commits (e.g. one per user agent fix).\n. Please open a new ticket per issue. Thanks.\n. Not until all tests pass, I'm afraid. I'll also ask you to clean it up and resubmit it as a single commit once that's done. I'd like to avoid polluting the tree with 15 commits with unclear messages.\n. Yes. Use a Git client on your own machine, pull the repository there, and push the changes back to your repo.\n. As I recommended earlier: please use a Git client, make your changes locally and submit them in atomic ready to be merged issues. I'd love to be able to include your contributions, but you really need to follow the contribution guidelines if you want me to be able to do so. I'm closing this for now hoping you'll be able to get your git client to work and submit new pull requests with one change (e.g. support for the AvantGo browser + related tests) per pull request (I suggest you create one branch per issue, all forked from the master branch).\n. You're welcome to send a PR for the guidelines too.\n. I'm open to the first part of your issue. SOmeone needs to do the work and combine it into something that is language agnostic.\nThe second part od your question is a red herring, there is no standard used across user agents that allows you to gather this data in a meaningful way. If it was the case, this whole project would be pointless and no one would have started it.\n. I don't. But I don't see what difference this would really make, as none of your chunks would gain meaning in the process.\n. What are the benefits of this approach? What are the drawbacks?\n. Sure, but can you easily express all the error routines in language agnostic way? How will you crowd-source those? Etc.\nAlso: http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/ :D\n. The way this project is structured makes it really easy to share the parser across a wide variety of computer languages (hence language agnostic). It also makes it very easy for folks to contribute to the project (crowd-source friendly).\n. It is also trivial to spoof the JS user agent string. :) Anyway, this thread has gone way off topic at this point. I'm going to close this and let you reopen an issue exclusively targeting your OSFamily request if you think there's value in that.\n. Thanks. Patch welcomed.\n. The 13K tests that ua-parser contains are run in ~2 seconds. Clearly the number of tests is not an issue at this point.\nI don't see any value in pruning the test files. Closing this as wontfix.\n. It is generally rather rare that we have to fix existing test cases. If so, it's still cheaper to do this on a case per case basis.\n. Please cleanup your repository of start from a fresh copy. Closing this as I won't be able to merge it.\n. You probably want to wipe our your GH fork and fork anew.\n. Could you provide a test for this? I was under the impression we had this covered already.\n. Beautiful. Thanks!\n. Thanks that's a bunch more readable. May I suggest you create a branch per pull request on your side? Should make things a lot easier.\n. > wouldnt making multiple branches cause the same problem as before when i made the branch for amigaos and it still pulled from the master branch.\nNo. You just need to make your branches from the untouched master branch.\n. > is there anything else needed for this to be merged?\nYes, please see my above comment in regexp.yaml.\n. This PR can't be merged. Please rebase it and reopen this issue once it's ready to be merged. Thanks!\n. A whole bunch of tests need to be updated apparently.\n. Get a better client or use the command line. That's unheard of.\n. Yes. Please address my above comment about regexp readability.\n. Yes please. :)\n. What is this patch fixing?\n. Will need tests to be fixed.\n. @philipzae can you please try to bundle commits together as much as possible? 3-5 commits for a single change pollutes the revision history and makes backing out of problematic commits much more complicated then needed.\n. Well, in that case, please fix your client before continuing your contributions. Thanks.\n. The fact that you're working from the Web client shouldn't prevent you from giving helpful names to commits. I thank you for your contributions but kindly ask you to be a good citizen and adere to good coding practices and respect contribution guidelines. Thanks.\n. Please change the commit \"title\" (first line). That's the key part. (Hadn't even noticed the \"description\" as this is a GH concept, not a Git one.) \nThanks!\n. git commit --amend is your friend. ;)\n. There are merge conflicts here, unfortunately.\nCan you please fix?\n. I don't know. You might want to close this PR and open a new one if you can't figure this out.\n. Thanks!\n. That's awesome! Could you add tests?\n. There are YAML files in /test_resources.\n. Have you tried rebasing after pulling a recent master?\n. Yes, sorry. You're rebasing from your own GitHub account. You want to rebase from mine. To do so, add it as a remote ($ git remote add main git@github.com:tobie/ua-parser.git), fetch it ($ git fetch main) then rebase from there ($ git rebase main/master HbbTV).\n. No problem. Closing. Obsoleted by #286.\n. Fixed in fa7003f3\n. Awesome. Thanks a bunch!\nCan you please update the main README with details of your port (create a new usage section, add yourself as a maintainer of this part, and add the licensing terms for the port too).\nThanks again.\n. just follow the terms of the license precisely:\n- http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#redistribution for regexes.yaml\n- https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/php/LICENSE for the PHP code.\n. Could you please add tests for this?\n. @commenthol could you please rebase this PR now that I've accepted @jpvincent's patch? (I had missed yours previously).\nWould also like @elsigh's input on the branding changes (iPad --> Apple iPad).\n. Looking at your other PR (#284), and the brand issue you bring up here, we might want to change what the device object contains, maybe to something like:\ndevice.brand // => \"Nokia\"\ndevice.family // => \"Lumia\"\ndevice.model // => \"505\"\nThoughts?\n. > But we've been inconsistent here right?\nYeah, we've consistently been inconsistent.\nGiven that, I'm not sure what the best strategy going forward is, tbh.\n. There's a tremendous amount of noise due to whitespace issues in your diff. Think you could fix that?\n. @mamod think travis now supports multiple languages. Think it would be worthwhile adding your travis build here? In which case this PR could happen here.\n@commenthol think we should have separate PR, here, too. This is going to get ugly quickly if not.\n. Great stuff overall. The \"multiple replacement placeholder\" stuff needs to be brought up a bit more globally so that all implementations can use it.\nWhat's the backwards compat story, here?\n. Any news?\n. The Travis build is failing right now, so the first step would be to fix that.\n. /cc @elsigh ^\n. @elsigh agree this commit is awesome.\nConcerned with updates of ports besides JS, python, and perl, though\nWhat's the story here? How should we handle that (this time and in the future)?\n. > I don't know how many of our langs are supported by travis, but that the more we can have all of the parsers run the same tests the better. If all the langs were running through Travis it does place quite a burden on anyone who wants a new feature to put it in everywhere, but I'd be ok with that.\nAgreed.\n\nFor this case I'm not that concerned here about new functionality in the device parser, as opposed to say the UA parser. But it would be nice to get a note out to all the other maintainers at a minimum.\n\nThat sounds good. We need a channel to do that, though. Any suggestions?\n\nThen again, if we had a single page/file that outlines the spec of the parser everyone could subscribe to that and we could approve changes to that file before changes to any/all langs.\n\n[snip]\n\nRight now we just have a little section for each language but not an overall spec..\n\nThat's also a great idea. Should we get started?\n. That looks like a good start. I'll try to find time to review this by EOW. Thanks for your work on this!\n. I completely dropped the ball on this one. Sorry.\nCc: @enemaerke, @shripadk, @yihuanz, @ozataman, @sjiang, @mamod, @dmolsen, @nielsbasjes, @elsigh\nFolks,\nI'd like for us to be able to move forward with this PR. For this I'd like feedback by the November 1st from you all on whether you're intending to implement the changes in your language port or not, and ideally an estimated timeframe in which you will be ready to release an updated version.\n@commenthol, I really like you early spec draft. I suggest you create a separate PR for it so we can pull it in and work on it in the meantime. I've also given you commit rights to the repo, please handle this right responsibly. ;)\nThanks.\n--tobie\n. As a sidenote, wouldn't device.manufacturer make more sense then device.brand?\n. > Therefore I would like to stick with \"brand\" in order to be able to solve those cases.\nMakes sense.\n. > my nexus 4 says LG on the back.\nThis is going to be fun!\n. Haven't heard back from a bunch of you. I guess the only reasonable strategy there will be to mark as obsolete (and or remove?) these implementation from the project.\nOverall, it might be worthwhile to reconsider how to best organize this project.\n. Create a new issue (#304) to discuss this further.\n. Likewise. Should have more time for this starting early August.\n. Looks like you have an issue with the python port not implementing os_v1_replacement--hence the travis build fail. @elsigh can you chime in, here? What's the plan?\n. > Hrm, it looks like OSParser has os_v1_replacement actually..\nMy bad, looked in the wrong place. Sorry.\n. Merged #287. Restarted the travis build which should now pass.\n. LGTM. Merging.\n. In the future, please rebase master instead of merging it (less commit noise).\n. What makes you think the test is a fault here, rather than the Java implementation?\n. Looking at this a bit more in detail, it's clear to me that the issue is with the Java implementation (which doesn't handle os_v2_replacement properly.) Android Donut is == to version 1.2, not version 1.\nClosing this as wontfix.\nIMHO the issue is with the lack/partial support for os_v2_replacement in the Java implementation.\n. > I wasn't claiming that there's a problem with tests, but if the test are failing under Java, then I think this should be fixed one way (changes to tests, that didn't work under Java when added) or other (changes to Java implementation).\nAgreed this should be fixed. But this should be fixed the correct way. Turns out the tests are correct and the Java implementation isn't. Therefore the implementation needs fixing.\n\nI can suggest that probably easiest way to fix that would be to remove that that test case from Java's version of tests, if that's OK.\n\nThat's not possible, unfortunately. The tests are shared across implementations.\n. Test cases would be awesome!\n. You have a bunch of tests failing, some which are to do with how YAML distinguishes null from undefined.\nCould you please fix those?\n. Yeah, I had the same reaction. Are these two different browsers or the same browser on two different platforms?\n. It sounds like we should treat as IEMobile, then, and identify the device through the device parser, no?\n. Please reopen once you've fixed the failing test cases. Thanks!\n. Pull request welcomed.\n. LGTM\n. Think it would be great to add a section that recommends a JSON structure for the output of the parser that implementations are supposed to stay close to.\n. Closing this as it's already been merged in the new repo.\n. Not sure I understand the goal (goals?) of this PR. Could you elaborate.\n. OK, I guess, I need to try it out to really understand.\n. That what as smart move. Thanks!\n. Please rebase your change from the current master. There's about 15 unrelated commits in here.\n. We're integrating these changes in the new repository:\nhttps://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core\n. We're splitting up devices into brand, family and model. See #285.\n. I'd actually favor smaller incremental PR. Getting agreement, reviewing massive PR like #285 is a slow process.\n. Thanks for your suggestion @commenthol.\nThere's are two things about it that bother me:\n1. I want ports to each have their own repository, whether they're part of the ua-parser GitHub org or not.\n2. splitting up copies of regexes across files and folders is utterly wrong. It's basically re-inventing versioning, but making us do it by hand. Accepting contributions would be terrible, merging stuff atrocious and will bump into issue were previous versions get fixed but not new ones, etc.\nThe only reasonable choice to serve different version of the regex is to tag versions in GitHub, then have a open-source friendly host (e.g. nodejitsu) serve all of the differently tagged versions.\n. Yeah. That's the path I'm looking at. \n. Started some action here: https://github.com/ua-parser\n. Lack of time. :-(\n. Closing this. See you in the mailing list, irc, or on https://github.com/ua-parser/ua-parser.github.io/issues.\n. Cool. I don't think I've seen you chime in on #285. Can you?\n. Closing this given a conversation on perf is starting on the mailing list.\n. I don't think possible values are a closed set, actually. But I might be wrong. I'd love to include a script that would gather this data from the YAML into the repo itself if you're so inclined, @BradRuderman.\n. Done. Thanks for your help so far @dmolsen!\n. Sorry, I though you were planning to finish the TODOs before getting this pulled in.\nThis LGTM but needs addition to the main README file. I'll pull as soon as that's ready.\n. Sorry for the huge delay in pulling this. :(\n. Closing this as wontfix (as explained in #75)\n. This is not passing a number of tests: https://travis-ci.org/tobie/ua-parser/builds/16018472.\n. Please reopen this PR once you've fixed the failing tests. Thanks!\n. Ya, sorry folks. This project is in urgent need of an overhaul in order to\nsimplify this issue. Sorry this has been delayed.

If we follow this line of reasoning, we should have all of the following report as Firefox, no?\n- pale moon (firefox variant)\n- firefox mobile\n- firefox namoroka\n- firefox shiretoko\n- firefox minefield\n- firefox alpha\n- firefox beta\n- microb\n- mozilladeveloperpreview\n- iceweasel\n\nIn which case we should also do the same with Chrome Canary and the like. Or am I missing something?\n. /cc @commenthol @Ironholds \n. > 1. Really kick-off the seperation of parsers to yaml rules as intended by #304 and started with ua-parser.\n\n\nPrepare the parser base-projects to allow PRs from active members \nMilestones and/or Timelines could be a good starting point...\nStep1: Migrate the present\n\n\nStep2: Adding new features\n\n\nAgreed.\n\n\nConsider correct versioning as must-have\nua-parser on npm is in a terrible state #323\nIs releasing Java SNAPSHOTS only the right release model?\n\n\nI think we should completely split out the software versioning from the regex versioning. We need to provide the regexes through an (JSON) API, making both the latest version available and each change set. The different lang ports could then just fetch that data on a regular basis.\n\n\nTruely state what shall be in and what shall be out-of-scope of ua-parser.\n\n\nI think a lot of the below are loadable goals, but not all are necessarily doable with the resources we have.\n\n\nE.g. Is Brand-Model Parsing as proposed in #466 really desired?\n\n\nIt seems we agreed it is, but frankly I'd need a three bullet point summary which includes the risk + cost of doing that to make a decision.\n\n\nDoes generalization of parser sematics (multi-replacements, case-insensitive matches as of brand-model parsing) make sense for user_agent_parsers: and os_parsers: rules as well?\n\n\nSame as above.\n\n\nCan we finalize the first draft version of the spec? #300\n\n\nYes. Can we first decide where it belongs, though? Should we give it its own repo?\n\n\nAre annotating parsing results desired? E.g. does this project want to have details of a device \"mobile/tablet/desktop\" as proposed in #428 or doesn't it as stated in #75?\n\n\nI'm keeping to my initial position here. As explained on both #428 (which I just closed) and in previous occasions.\n\n\nDo we want to get seperate parser-rules for browser engines as proposed by #241?\n\n\nI'm fine with that, but it should happen after we ship the split-up version of ua-parser.\n\n\nOrder of priority: Is performance more important than the detailed detection of a UA?\n\n\nThat's a good question. I think that the work @Ironholds will be leading here should allow us to keep our cake and eat it too. If the regexes are sorted, we can pretty much have both.\n\nIs working on performance, which inevitable involves a change of parser semantics, a project goal?\n\nKey goal here is to make this project easy to contribute to and easy to use in different languages.\n. Yeah. This is not a client-side tool. Legitimate client-side usecases are seldom, tbh. \n. Current repo is here: https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-java. Closing.\n.

I don't actually mind that much if we don't standardize property names or what the parsers do. Sure, it seems like that would be a nice touch, but it's not a requirement. I don't think the JS parser does v2 or v3 fwiw.\nI'm with Tobie on point #2 as well. My hunch is that you need things added things to regexes.yaml to support this, and I'm good with that.\n. Yeah, this looks like it can now be done from the UA string. That was not always true. Will fix.\n. It should be in the YAML regexes so all parsers benefit.\nI'm planning to take the @dmolsen's regexes file from https://raw.github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser-php/master/resources/user_agents_regex.yaml and replace the one in this project sometime today or tomorrow.\nOnce it's in, I'll add a chromeframe regex and test for python.\n.

Thanks Francois!\n@dmolsen I wonder if we can get Travis set up to run the python and php unit tests - have you ever done that w/ github? I'm eager to learn about it but figure it's some work... I wonder if we could turn all the multiple files in test resources into a single canonical yaml file with all the bits + OS + Device so that we could all run unit tests against that one file for each of our ports?\n. python does a sys.exit code 0 for success.\n.

Not to test that the\nimplementations follow the specification. Both are interesting, but I think\nwe can make the assumption for now that the various language\nimplementations all properly parse YAML, run the regexes and return the\nmatches in an \"object\", right?\nSo just running them i.e. in node should be sufficient.\n\nI think all the implementations have slightly different objects, but yeah.\nMostly the test should be to make sure that changes to regexes.yaml don't\nresult in regressions.\nThere's a huge number of UA strings and expected results in the\ntest_resources dir which the py test uses - some are much larger than\nothers, but even if it takes minutes to run all the tests, regressions in\nregexes.yaml need to not happen for the project to be successful.

I've removed the \"No?\" link from Browserscope and the issue tracker from UA Parser.\n. open source team ftw!\n. Fundamentally, ua-parser could be written to be much faster by doing string tree branching, but that doesn't lend itself really well to a shared, readable YAML file. Part of the reason I believe this project works and is being maintained and now exists in so many languages is that its fairly easy to grok - and easy to just add new regexes and whatnot.\n\nI'm not against re-ordering the YAML file provided that the tests don't break, but I'd like to see data that shows how much faster this is. None of the implementations (I believe) scan the YAML file on every parse. They should be able to put the YAML (or JSON) file into memory and then be iterating over an array of in-memory regexes.\n. Indeed - though we can't just put most common UA first afaik, because\nthere's a whole bunch of exceptions that have to come first, although - the\nregexes could be written to catch the most common UAs first (ala the notion\nof string branching) =) that's probably what you're thinking..

I also trawled the old Google Code project issues. Because of that I've\ncome up with quite a few additions as well as their associated testshttps://github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser/branchesand haven't finished adding them. I kept the additions granular (i.e. in\ntheir own branches) to give everyone the ability to chime in on individual\nchanges.\nBefore I went too far I decided to try to test merging my changes into one\nbig file. It was a miserable failure and I had to give up after four or so\nmerged branches. By always adding tests to the end of the files there was\nguaranteed to be a conflict. The amount of work involved just didn't seem\nworth it when maybe there was a better option.\nI've put together an example branch where I've broken out some\ncontributed tests into their own directories and fileshttps://github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser/tree/do-flex-test/test_resources/contributedwithin\ntest_resources.

(I'm going to let Tobie do the merge in case he wants another read over the JS bits)\n. Agreed - I suppose we're about to end up in a world where some ports have more info that others. \nI don't know how many of our langs are supported by travis, but that the more we can have all of the parsers run the same tests the better. If all the langs were running through Travis it does place quite a burden on anyone who wants a new feature to put it in everywhere, but I'd be ok with that.\nFor this case I'm not that concerned here about new functionality in the device parser, as opposed to say the UA parser. But it would be nice to get a note out to all the other maintainers at a minimum. Then again, if we had a single page/file that outlines the spec of the parser everyone could subscribe to that and we could approve changes to that file before changes to any/all langs.\nI guess I'm just hoping the other authors or parser users in those languages get compelled to have the same functionality and send in PRs down the line. \nRight now we just have a little section for each language but not an overall spec..\n.

I think it's high time we tackle this - this project is mature and seems to get a lot of use now. I particularly like the idea of serving YAML or JSON as a service - additionally, I'd like to see a simple web form that does a parse and displays the results in tables (with a CSRF token and some kind of throttling to prevent abuse).\n\nThe test_resources dir is presently a mess (my fault) - so this will also be a good time to clean it up.\nOne challenge with separating regexes.yaml from a thorough test - how will we be sure that a change to regexes.yaml doesn't break prior parse results? When that happens it may just mean that the test data itself needs to change, but it won't be obvious that the tests need to be updated until running  thorough run of any given port against the full tests. \nFor the web service itself, it would be nice to get a sponsor for the serving resources. Ideally it would be a company who's deployed the project already and depends on it, or is at least about to or something, so that there's a good line-up of incentive there. I was contacted kinda out of the blue by Adobe last week - I could reach out to them, but figure it's at least worth disucssing.\nHow cool would a get-together hackathon be? ;0\nThanks for bringing it up Tobie, and outlining a path.\n. Hey Tom - this isn't a bug in UA parser, slosing.\nWhat test are you trying to run? Feel free to post an URL here.\n. @tobie Do you care what language the .travis.yml file uses?\n. Do you know if FB (or anyone) can make a functional change to the webview? Though, I suppose that's actually what you're trying to check for, yeah?\nIf not I wonder if this is really a different UA, or more like OS - ie. some sort of container/annotation for a particular UA. In that case, I wonder if it might be better to either add an annotation to the OS object or device object in this case.\nI agree that it would be good to be able to detect the webview case, and also to be able to mark popular webview strings somehow (twitter, fb, etc...)\n. Yep - I totally agree that the string \"webview\" ought to be a part of the ua.family (i.e. Safari (webview)) to disambiguate it from normal Safari (assuming we can detect that difference from the UA string).\nIt's the latter part about the further-modified-by-distributor string (FB, Twitter) and I'm not sure where we should put that. \nSo I'm cool with family becoming Safari (Webview) and Chrome (Webview) - I think submitting a regex change PR is the way to go for this.\nLooks like someone put up a cool site to show what ua-parser currently determines the UA to be:\nhttp://www.whatsmyua.info/\n. I feel like if you can get a mergeable PR and it passes the tests I'm happy to approve. \nBreaking this up could be more trouble and effort than it's really worth.\nPS - major kudos for this work.\n. Sorry about that if there's something awry. I wonder what it is?\nI basically just pasted:\nview-source:http://ua-parser.appspot.com/json?indent=2\nand manually deleted the os_parsers and product_parsers section from the end (not yet implemented)\n. yep, sorry didn't notice that\n. I don't actually mind that much if we don't standardize property names or what the parsers do. Sure, it seems like that would be a nice touch, but it's not a requirement. I don't think the JS parser does v2 or v3 fwiw.\nI'm with Tobie on point #2 as well. My hunch is that you need things added things to regexes.yaml to support this, and I'm good with that.\n. Yeah, this looks like it can now be done from the UA string. That was not always true. Will fix.\n. It should be in the YAML regexes so all parsers benefit.\nI'm planning to take the @dmolsen's regexes file from https://raw.github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser-php/master/resources/user_agents_regex.yaml and replace the one in this project sometime today or tomorrow.\nOnce it's in, I'll add a chromeframe regex and test for python.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/commit/191a6d8c2ab67cea8bbfc5d029da4a30ce1e6e4d\n. Thanks Francois!\n@dmolsen I wonder if we can get Travis set up to run the python and php unit tests - have you ever done that w/ github? I'm eager to learn about it but figure it's some work... I wonder if we could turn all the multiple files in test resources into a single canonical yaml file with all the bits + OS + Device so that we could all run unit tests against that one file for each of our ports?\n. python does a sys.exit code 0 for success.\n.

Not to test that the\nimplementations follow the specification. Both are interesting, but I think\nwe can make the assumption for now that the various language\nimplementations all properly parse YAML, run the regexes and return the\nmatches in an \"object\", right?\nSo just running them i.e. in node should be sufficient.\n\nI think all the implementations have slightly different objects, but yeah.\nMostly the test should be to make sure that changes to regexes.yaml don't\nresult in regressions.\nThere's a huge number of UA strings and expected results in the\ntest_resources dir which the py test uses - some are much larger than\nothers, but even if it takes minutes to run all the tests, regressions in\nregexes.yaml need to not happen for the project to be successful.

I've removed the \"No?\" link from Browserscope and the issue tracker from UA Parser.\n. open source team ftw!\n. Fundamentally, ua-parser could be written to be much faster by doing string tree branching, but that doesn't lend itself really well to a shared, readable YAML file. Part of the reason I believe this project works and is being maintained and now exists in so many languages is that its fairly easy to grok - and easy to just add new regexes and whatnot.\n\nI'm not against re-ordering the YAML file provided that the tests don't break, but I'd like to see data that shows how much faster this is. None of the implementations (I believe) scan the YAML file on every parse. They should be able to put the YAML (or JSON) file into memory and then be iterating over an array of in-memory regexes.\n. Indeed - though we can't just put most common UA first afaik, because\nthere's a whole bunch of exceptions that have to come first, although - the\nregexes could be written to catch the most common UAs first (ala the notion\nof string branching) =) that's probably what you're thinking..

I also trawled the old Google Code project issues. Because of that I've\ncome up with quite a few additions as well as their associated testshttps://github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser/branchesand haven't finished adding them. I kept the additions granular (i.e. in\ntheir own branches) to give everyone the ability to chime in on individual\nchanges.\nBefore I went too far I decided to try to test merging my changes into one\nbig file. It was a miserable failure and I had to give up after four or so\nmerged branches. By always adding tests to the end of the files there was\nguaranteed to be a conflict. The amount of work involved just didn't seem\nworth it when maybe there was a better option.\nI've put together an example branch where I've broken out some\ncontributed tests into their own directories and fileshttps://github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser/tree/do-flex-test/test_resources/contributedwithin\ntest_resources. The upside to this is no merge conflict (on tests at\nleast) and more information about each test addition can be kept through\nthe use of the example info.yaml files. The downside is work on other\nlibrary maintainers to add support for the new directory structure.\nI realize my use case is a rare one.

(I'm going to let Tobie do the merge in case he wants another read over the JS bits)\n. Agreed - I suppose we're about to end up in a world where some ports have more info that others. \nI don't know how many of our langs are supported by travis, but that the more we can have all of the parsers run the same tests the better. If all the langs were running through Travis it does place quite a burden on anyone who wants a new feature to put it in everywhere, but I'd be ok with that.\nFor this case I'm not that concerned here about new functionality in the device parser, as opposed to say the UA parser. But it would be nice to get a note out to all the other maintainers at a minimum. Then again, if we had a single page/file that outlines the spec of the parser everyone could subscribe to that and we could approve changes to that file before changes to any/all langs.\nI guess I'm just hoping the other authors or parser users in those languages get compelled to have the same functionality and send in PRs down the line. \nRight now we just have a little section for each language but not an overall spec..\n.

On Tue, Oct 29, 2013 at 11:07 PM, commenthol notifications@github.comwrote:\nI just came across the js_ua attribute within test_user_agent_parser.yamlwhich broke the python tests.\nThis is some extra info which is only part of the python parser (See lines\n236ff).\nCurrently these tests are excluded in with_fixtures.js tests in line 22\nfrom the js parser as well as in the other langs (java, go, perl, php).\nApart from that the functionality is obsolete as the js_ua info provided\nin the testcases needs to come from somewhere.\nIMHO if this information provided by js_ua is relevant, then it should be\nin the regexes.yaml file but not in the parser itself.\nThis could be achieved either by using chromeframe as ua.family and not\nhaving any additional info or implementing the multireplace mechanism as\nwith the device parser.\nFor the moment I commented out js_ua in test_user_agent_parser.\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think that's fine.\njs_ua is for the peculiar case of detecting ChromeFrame which is now\ndiscontinued as well as some weird cases of IE in weird compat modes when\nthere were bugs in the betas.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/301#issuecomment-27367242\n.\n. I think it's high time we tackle this - this project is mature and seems to get a lot of use now. I particularly like the idea of serving YAML or JSON as a service - additionally, I'd like to see a simple web form that does a parse and displays the results in tables (with a CSRF token and some kind of throttling to prevent abuse).\n\nThe test_resources dir is presently a mess (my fault) - so this will also be a good time to clean it up.\nOne challenge with separating regexes.yaml from a thorough test - how will we be sure that a change to regexes.yaml doesn't break prior parse results? When that happens it may just mean that the test data itself needs to change, but it won't be obvious that the tests need to be updated until running  thorough run of any given port against the full tests. \nFor the web service itself, it would be nice to get a sponsor for the serving resources. Ideally it would be a company who's deployed the project already and depends on it, or is at least about to or something, so that there's a good line-up of incentive there. I was contacted kinda out of the blue by Adobe last week - I could reach out to them, but figure it's at least worth disucssing.\nHow cool would a get-together hackathon be? ;0\nThanks for bringing it up Tobie, and outlining a path.\n. Hey Tom - this isn't a bug in UA parser, slosing.\nWhat test are you trying to run? Feel free to post an URL here.\n. @tobie Do you care what language the .travis.yml file uses?\n. Do you know if FB (or anyone) can make a functional change to the webview? Though, I suppose that's actually what you're trying to check for, yeah?\nIf not I wonder if this is really a different UA, or more like OS - ie. some sort of container/annotation for a particular UA. In that case, I wonder if it might be better to either add an annotation to the OS object or device object in this case.\nI agree that it would be good to be able to detect the webview case, and also to be able to mark popular webview strings somehow (twitter, fb, etc...)\n. Yep - I totally agree that the string \"webview\" ought to be a part of the ua.family (i.e. Safari (webview)) to disambiguate it from normal Safari (assuming we can detect that difference from the UA string).\nIt's the latter part about the further-modified-by-distributor string (FB, Twitter) and I'm not sure where we should put that. \nSo I'm cool with family becoming Safari (Webview) and Chrome (Webview) - I think submitting a regex change PR is the way to go for this.\nLooks like someone put up a cool site to show what ua-parser currently determines the UA to be:\nhttp://www.whatsmyua.info/\n. I feel like if you can get a mergeable PR and it passes the tests I'm happy to approve. \nBreaking this up could be more trouble and effort than it's really worth.\nPS - major kudos for this work.\n.

Francois-\nThanks for submitting the issue. I've updated regexes.yaml & quickly tested the change. Looks good. It also helped me catch an issue with identifying Android device names.\n. @elsigh never done it but it sounds like it might be well worth it. let me play around with the PHP stuff and see what i can get going. leaving this URL here for reference:\nhttp://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/php/\n. Looks like Opera Mini & Opera Mobile aren't following Google's standards for how to identify tablet-based vs. phone-based user-agent strings. I've updated the tablet check to take this into account tho tablet-based versions of these UA strings might be wonky. Need to find some more tests for it. Thanks for the ticket, Erik.\n. for the record, i liked the \"luv ya git\" comment :)\n. I'll get this fixed. Thanks.\n. The notice is fixed but I have a feeling that might not address your issue assuming you tried php UAParser.php -get and still got that notice. It could be that STDIN isn't working in your case. I'm closing the ticket because this issue is addressed. If you find it still doesn't work comment again and I'll re-open. Please include info on your version of PHP and OS. Thanks.\n. Ok, cool :)\n. thanks for fixing these :)\n. Rather than fix regexes.yaml I ended up fixing my PHP lib instead. This way if I forgot parens in the future it won't break again. Thanks much for letting us know about the issue and providing good details.\n. thanks for the fix :)\n. Have you grabbed the latest version of regexes.yaml? I know I fixed this bug a while back. The UA string you provided gets classified correctly as Polaris in my test. You can run your own test by visiting the following website:\nhttp://uaparser.dmolsen.com/\nI'm closing this issue for now. If you find that there is still an error please let me know. Have a good day.\n. This is a problem with a specific test in Modernizr. ua-parser appears to classify the browser correctly. For a longer explanation check out my update on this issue opened on Detector's repo.\n. maybe we could pop the trident version into the build and revision numbers? e.g. IE 8 in compatibility mode would report IE 7.0 but you'd have major=>7, minor=>0, build=>4, revision=>0 so if someone needed to do a check on compat they could by looking at the build/revision numbers. btw, build & revision are what I call those in the php lib. \n. closing this one up. not a huge issue either way.\n. thanks for the fix :)\n. I have a feeling there's something else in the UA that's setting off that check. Can you hit http://uaparser.dmolsen.com for me and copy the results into a comment for this issue, please? Thanks.\n. Stupid question... Are you running IE9 on a tablet pc?\nThe \"Tablet PC 2.0\" string is setting off one of my checks that's really designed for Android tablets. That said, Windows seems to think that it's running on a tablet and if that's the case then having isMobileDevice set to true is actually appropriate. Interestingly enough there seems to be a case for knowing this detail. I'm curious how accurate this bit of data is though. \nIf you could also hit this with IE 9 mode & tell me the results I'd appreciate it.\n. For now I'm leaving the php lib unchanged. It's a bad match but I'm going to err on the side of most versions of Windows that are Tablet PC capable actually being tablets. It's a toss-up I think. The tablet attribute might had to drop completely anyway. Sorry.\n. NetFront is definitely the browser name. See the real product: http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/browser/\nI confused the Vita and Nintendo products. The Vita is it OS. I'm not sure what the \"version number\" is for exactly. I'm not sure it necessarily tracks to a specific version of NetFront. \nI'll close this pull request since I effed it up obviously. Sorry 'bout that.\n. Just wanted to chime in to say I've seen the issue. I'm with @tobie in the sense that I'd hate to break compat but a) it's not the biggest outward change in the world and b) I can see the uses for unit testing (assuming @tobie's suggestion works just as well from a perf perspective). I'm going to try his suggestion just to see what happens.\n. in the short-term i made a fix to the existing lib so that the regexes file is only loaded once. that addresses the perf issue. i think @rjd22 is going in the right direction so i'll keep trying to work in his fixes. i played with this yesterday and found a solution that was backwards compatible but it throws a strict standards error if a dev is running in that mode. i'm going to keep playing around with it but i know i have other stuff that will take me from it for a few weeks.\nbecause of my tweak this pull request can no longer be automatically merged. i forked @rjd22's work so either i'll get a fix in from there or he can submit another pull request if he has a backwards compatible solution. \n. Um... that's embarrassing. Fixed. Thanks.\n. FWIW, the PHP lib classifies this UA as mobile because $ua->family matches a string in my mobile browser array. This info is already available in regexes.yaml as mobile_user_agent_families.\n. I think it's sort of confusing as well. There's a reason I haven't pushed the isMobile etc. back upstream myself. They seemed to be a departure from the original intent of ua-parser which is why I called my lib a pseudo-port (and it still is).\n- isMobile should be thought of as a mobile browser not on a tablet. \n- isMobileDevice can be either a phone or tablet\n- isTablet is just terribly brittle. The really bad example is Windows Tablet which can return true for devices that, if we were just looking at them, we'd classify as netbooks. They just happen to have the right OS/under-the-hood-hardware combo to affect the UA. That and the screen dimensions open a whole other can of worms.\nAs for the examples cited:\n- Playbook is true for isMobileDevice and isTablet and false for isMobile so doesn't break the classification. \n- iPad (mini or not since the UA doesn't provide a distinction) is true for isMobileDevice and isTablet\n- iPod touch is true for isMobileDevice and isMobile\nFrankly, I was thinking of dropping isTablet. I think it gives false hope. isMobileDevice could then also be dropped and isMobile then simply refers to what I classify as mobile browsers. It can be expanded to be set to true for devices we know are mobile but can't assign a browser family too. The problem there though is that, in my set-up,  isMobile would be true for the Playbook because I list BlackBerry WebKit as a mobile browser which the Playbook is obviously using. To me that would be an appropriate classification. You may disagree :)\nFWIW, I haven't properly integrated the test suite. Doing that during the holiday weekend.\n// just because i can include it... :8ball: \n. Yeah. I'll get that fixed.\n. Thanks for the heads up. I'll get it fixed :)\n. the fix should be committed to the repo this holiday weekend. got it fixed. just trying to merge in a lot of other changes too.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks for reporting it.\n. Just to clarify... are you looking at moving these arrays into regexes.yaml? Seems like they could just be their own blocks and accessed like the others.\n- mobile browsers\n- mobile OSes\n- mobile devices\n- tablets\nThe only odd lines seem to be:\n- check for android tablet\n- check for tablet\nWhich to me are fragile/brittle and not sure they should stick around honestly. Did I miss anything else that might be specific to the PHP port that should get rolled into the overall YAML file?\n. Will do. :)\n. I don't think keeping this feature in the PHP version is appropriate. I think the PHP library, as written today, is too far away from the original goals of ua-parser. It was written for my needs and those needs don't really match-up with what I assume your and @elsigh's goals are for the project.\nIn order to move forward I think I'll rewrite the PHP lib. I can make it match-up exactly with the output of the other libraries. All of the boolean options can be moved into a separate codebase that I can host. I'll finish v1.5 that I'm working on now to address the pull requests and open issues. After that I'll just strip down the library and do a v2.0 that is a true ua-parser PHP lib.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks.\n. just a heads up that i'm working on merging this and the other pull request from @Synchro locally. thanks for the fixes. i'll leave all of the pull requests to my lib open until i push the final release.\n. This is fixed in the version that I'm working based on your pull requests. I'll leave this open until I push the changes.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks.\n. Looked into this pull request just to see if it could be cleared. The request needs fixing but it may be that the test also needs to be fixed. The basic question is should ua-parser list Android (even modified) as the OS for Kindles as this PR suggests or should we list it as a separate Kindle OS which is what the test currently looks for. \nOlder Kindles are based on Android 2.3. Latest Kindles are based on Android 4.\n. now nuked in my local version. i'll close this issue when i push all of my latest changes to the lib to the repo. thanks.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks.\n. How do you want the tests? Should I just add tests to the appropriate files in test_resources/ and commit them?\n. I'll wait on this one to be resolved before cleaning up and adding tests for the BB10 UA. Not sure if I screwed something up.\n. ok, i'll clean up this merge and redo the pull request. sorry, tobie.\n. I believe these have been taken out already but this issue wasn't closed. On my phone so can't triple-check but wanted to help keep the clean up  moving :)\nOn Dec 29, 2012, at 7:06 AM, Tobie Langel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@dmolsen can I go ahead and remove this?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @selwin-\n\nFWIW, I've pulled out a lot of the is* code from the PHP lib for a new project, ua-classifier, that sort of mirrors the organization of ua-parser. I've been spending a lot of time trolling logs to find new UAs for regexes.yaml and hopefully can use that for the new project. Maybe you'll find the final YAML file useful for your project too.\n. FWIW, the PHP version, on my local comp, has a 10x speed improvement when using a JSON version of regexes.yaml. \n. The next edition of the PHP lib will be using a JSON version of regexes.yaml. The command line tool I have will fetch and convert the YAML from the repo. \n. What should be the expected results for Windows-related UAs? Pushing XP, Vista, 7, etc to the OS major works except in the case of Windows Phone 7. In that case should the major be 'Phone OS', the minor '7' and, in the case of 7.5, the patch '5'?\nThe following UA currently gets classified as Windows Phone OS:\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; XBLWP7; ZuneWP7)\nThe following UA currently gets classified as Windows Phone OS with a major of 7 and a minor of 5.\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows Phone OS 7.5; Trident/5.0; IEMobile/9.0; NOKIA; Lumia 900)\nI can put in a pull request for the fix once I know the direction that I should take. Or maybe I misunderstood the original issue. \n. We should also try to fit Windows 3.1 into the update as well. The specific version is unrecognized. I figure it's a spoof but I got this lovely UA in my logs this month:\nNCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)\n. I don't believe this project has \"child\" versions of the main YAML file in the individual libs. Or at least they shouldn't. \n. Interesting... the PHP lib returns it as a \"Generic Smartphone\" which, looking at the regexes, is correct. Maybe this is a library specific bug?\n. That stuff came out of my original build and I do case insensitive matching hence why it works with the PHP lib. In the case of MIDP I can add the uppercase version to the regex. I can review the other smartphone choices as well and see if I can get the correct case for them. I'll dig up test cases.\n. All of the search engine regexes will have to be reviewed for case sensitivity too. I should be able to use some of the PHP command line features with my work Apache log files to quickly narrow down those issues. We'll just have to accept that the feature phone regex will be hit or miss tho maybe that can also be addressed with some healthy log parsing as well.\n. This is related to #102. FWIW, what do you think the OS should be? I assume Android but just checking.\n. I'll try to get this addressed and put in a pull request. I think we need to review/fix the Kindle regexes in general.\n. By the way, this is related to issues #102 and #127 \n/cc @elsigh because github decided not to properly link you in the original issue\n. I have the tests and what not written for this. I won't be in a position to drop a pull request until Tuesday. \nOn Dec 29, 2012, at 6:53 AM, Tobie Langel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHere's what I believe we need:\nNon Android OS:\nUA: NetFront \nDevice: Kindle\nOS: Kindle OS\nAndroid OS:\nUA: Amazon Silk\nDevice: Kindle Fire\nOS: Android OS\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Based on my work over the holiday break I feel pretty comfortable saying the following:\n- I can update the Generic Smartphone regexes based on what exists within regexes.yaml to date as well as some examples I've found trolling my logs\n- I can't update the Generic Feature Phone regexes. I don't have any good examples.\n- I can update the Search Bot regexes.\n\nShould we just drop the Feature Phone regex then? And should we move the search bot regexes up to user_agent_parsers? That's my fault for sticking it in the device parsers section when I didn't think my changes would ever be merged with a larger project.\nStill working on this.\n. I'll give those a spin. Only so much time to play against that substantial list though. Hopefully a few of those can be dropped simply because we're already matching their actual device listings.\n. Have at it :)\nOn Dec 29, 2012, at 7:07 AM, Tobie Langel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@dmolsen can I go ahead with this?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I'd like to see this. I'm not sure the current set-up of regexes.yaml can or should handle this though. For example, the primary regexes for this are:\n\n- regex: 'SAMSUNG-([A-Za-z0-9\\-]+)'\n  device_replacement: 'Samsung $1'\n- regex: 'SAMSUNG\\; ([A-Za-z0-9\\-]+)'\n  device_replacement: 'Samsung $1'\nNice and simple. Maybe we could have a separate YAML that allows for specific device to marketing name match-up. If someone needs it they can include it. If not... no extra overhead. The Galaxy S3 has, according to Wikipedia at least, 13 different model numbers for the same marketing name. The Samsung Galaxy S has ~20 different variants of model numbers and marketing names (Wikipedia source). \nAgain, I'd really like to see it and at least some of it could be pulled with effort from sources like Wikipedia.\nDoes anyone have an intern that needs something to do? ;)\n. FWIW, this is the regex that's being tested by the failing test:\n- regex: '(Silk-Accelerated=[a-z]{4,5})'\n  os_replacement: 'Android'\nAnd this is the result I get for that UA locally in the PHP lib:\nua->family: Amazon Silk\nua->major: 2\nua->minor: 2\nua->patch: \nua->toString: Amazon Silk 2.2\nua->toVersionString: 2.2\nos->family: Android\nos->major: \nos->minor: \nos->patch: \nos->patch_minor: \nos->toString: Android\nos->toVersionString: \ndevice->family: Kindle Fire HD\ntoFullString: Amazon Silk 2.2/Android\nuaOriginal: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; en-us; KFTT Build/IML74K) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Silk/2.2 Safari/535.19 Silk-Accelerated=true\nSorry, not sure what I'm breaking.\n. Works for me. Yet another lesson learned. Sorry.\n. I don't get the error in PHP 5.3.19 or PHP 5.3.17. I'm running in strict mode so I would assume this error would fire. I also replicated your error reporting and didn't get it. Rather than having those public functions (uaParser(), osParser(), and deviceParser) end in an r I can just remove it. That will remove any naming issues/conflicts but keep a certain consistency.\nAnd I don't think strict errors shouldn't be firing on that version of PHP and your reporting level. Baffled but it's a relatively easy fix in case others might run into the same thing.\nThe fix should be in this evening.\n. @pmailer-\nThe feature will be making a comeback in a new project called ua-classifier. I just needed to clean up the ua-parser lib to match everyone else. You should be able to continue using the older version of the library for now just fine. I apologize for the big change.\n. So what you're looking at in the ua-parser repository currently is a different version than what testswarm is using. testswarm is using 1.x and the repo is 2.x. There is no JSON file in the ua-parser repo. The JSON file is built using the 2.x version of the PHP lib. \nI believe your issue is at line #69 of your version of uaparser-cli.php. Please remove the @ before file_get_contents(). That should then throw an error for you. Also, please make sure allow_url_fopen is set to true in your PHP configuration.\n. Since you haven't chimed in on this I'm going to close this issue up. Feel free to open if you have further questions/issues.\n. fixity fixed\n. just wanted to let you know i've seen this. just haven't had a chance to merge it. looks like a lot of whitespace changes so i want to address that first. btw, if you have changes to regexes.yaml that might help everyone please feel free to do a pull request with tests.\n. While I think the ideal is that users contribute back I think the reality is that they patch and never contribute. I've heard this from a few devs. I'm not sure offering the option is any more encouragement to patch regexes.yaml than without the feature honestly. It's going to happen regardless.\nHell, keeping their patches separate but building a comparison tool might even help show folks that they can/should contribute regexes back.\n. Hand added this. Local git pull was being silly and not allowing me to merge your changes sans white space issues.\n. i'll get this added over the weekend.\n. Hand added this. Local git pull was being silly and not allowing me to merge your changes sans white space issues.\n. I think there needs be some discussion regarding this. I would argue that we should change the Wii browser to return Opera since that's what it really is. The Wii U should return NetFront NX because that's the real browser for it. Device should then return Wii U or Wii as appropriate. \nFor tests I have some written up for the Wii U but they match my interpretation of browser, OS (which I've put as 'Other'), and device for it. At least it's a start.\nWii info: http://console.maban.co.uk/device/wii.php\nWii U info: http://console.maban.co.uk/device/wiiu.php\nMy tests: https://github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser/compare/master...do-nintendo-wii-u\n. I'm not sure this is truly what the OS is called... \nhttp://wiiudaily.com/wii-u-operating-system/\nWant me to go with that? It's been difficult finding OS names for game systems. Also, before I put in a PR I'd like to suggest a different way of doing it. I have 24 branches at the moment with more UAs/tests that I need to add and they don't all merge nicely. I need to clean-up the concept a little bit today and then I'll put in an issue bout it.\n. @elsigh -\ni went through the old issues list last week and pulled out the ones we weren't properly matching. i hope to have them committed this weekend. i can go back and close them up like i've done in the past if you like.\n. this also address issue #158 \n. The existing test files don't appear to be in alphabetical order. I agree that would help assuming they were already ordered correctly.\n. Thanks to @tobie for handling my many pull requests so far. I just wanted to give you both an update about where I was with them. After these three PRs that are in the queue I still need to add tests and put in PRs for the following items. \nMost of the following have tests and I have UAs for all of these. I have seen these in production logs:\n- ~~Add: Huawei devices~~\n- ~~Add: ICE Browser~~\n- ~~Add: Power PC Mac OS~~\n- ~~Add: Openwave browser~~\n- ~~Add: QQ browser~~\n- ~~Add: Solaris~~\n- Add: Micromax devices\n- ~~Add: VRE (virtual runtime environment, a pseudo-os)~~\n- ~~Add: Phantom browser~~\n- ~~Add: WebTV~~\n- ~~Add: OneBrowser~~\n- ~~Add: iBrowser~~\n- Add: J2ME (for Opera UAs)\n- ~~Add: Baidu Desktop~~\n- Fix: Netscape 6\n- Fix: UP.browser\n- ~~Fix: webOS~~\n- ~~Fix: HTC devices~~\n- Fix: update the list of generic smartphones matches so their case is correct\nBased on the issues open in the original ua-parser repo I have to update the following:\n- Add: Fast browser\n- ~~Add: yandex browser~~\n- Add: Firefox Tablet\n- Fix: Mathon\n- Fix: Seamonkey version numbers\nBased on trolling around I've found the following that we should add (I have UAs from user-agent-string.info or their official sites):\n- Add: Doris browser\n- Add: Go Browser\n- Add: Xbox\n- Add: Nook\n- Add: Boxee\n- Add: Opera on HbbTV\n- Add: Skyfire browser\n- Add: NineSky browser\n- ~~Add: Firefox OS~~\nI still need to find Roku and SmartTV UAs.\nI also have a bunch of extraneous UAs broken down into groups but they don't need to be added. I wanted to open another issue about them:\n- W3C validators\n- Search Bots (which I will use to update the list we have)\n- Social Media Bots\n- RSS Readers\n- Google-specific UAs\n- Multimedia applications\n- Link Checkers\n- A few traditional desktop apps\n. Short of adding these all in one go and comparing perf I can't really say. Again, I wouldn't add the last list of options (the W3C validators, etc.). I think this sounds like a lot of additions but won't end up being that many. At the very least the majority are modern browsers.\nI think libs switching to JSON (if appropriate) and reorganizing/cleaning up the file will go a long way to really improving performance (see #162). Their are bots listed pretty high in the ua parse section, I'm sure their are UAs that can be combined into those longer patterns, and the devices are currently alphabetized (for the most part) so maybe those need to be moved around. I wanted to get stuff added first and then tackle that part.\nDefinitely agree with the concern though :) The NCSA Mosaic must have been a spoof in my production logs but it's still kind of fun to say ua-parser will recognize it even if it is a little overhead ;)\n. @elsigh you might also want to run these tests. i know the PHP lib doesn't support the chrome frame tests so I'd like to make sure I didn't bork anything with them when i alphabetized.\n. Can this PR be reviewed and merged if appropriate, please? Once it's merged I can then get moving again on getting the updated UA matches and tests pulled in as well.\n. @tobie \nthe files were built with a simple PHP script that took the originals, parsed the YAML, sorted on a key built out of a lowercased combination of family, major, minor, patch, and patch minor attributes as available and then kicked out new YAML files. this is why the comments and any data that had been specifically commented out is gone.\nobviously the UAs and attributes match up because it's passing tests. otherwise the data matches up:\n- test_device.yaml - 56 lines, 3.2K ( original | mine )\n- additional_os_tests.yaml - 149 lines, 4.7-8K ( original | mine )\n- test_user_agent_parser.yaml - 444 lines (if you account for commented out/extra lines in original) ( original | mine )\n- test_user_agent_parser_os.yaml - 426 lines (if you account for commented out/extra lines in original) ( original | mine )\nthe firefox set of tests are just completely redone because the original is missing lines between the tests.\nanother simple PHP script confirms that each file has the exact same number of and same string matches for the UA tests between your repo's test files and my fork's test files.\n. Ok, I see the error. PHP lib cleans up underscores. Forgot about that. Should the result be Amaze_4G or Amaze _4G (that's a space)? The Travis error looks like the latter.\n. Bad match on NOKIA. Fixing it.\n. I don't think underscores have any real meaning. I would just treat it as part of a larger string for that attribute. As in this case minor is 2_7. \"a,\" \"b,\" or \"pre\" have a little more meaning to me as a dev and I can see splitting them. Unfortunately it looks like regexes.yaml handles this issue in conflicting ways. I think this is related to if their are any open attributes or not. Two good examples:\n```\n  - user_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.3a4pre) Gecko/20100404 SeaMonkey/2.1a1pre'\n    family: 'SeaMonkey'\n    major: '2'\n    minor: '1'\n    patch: 'a1pre'\n\nuser_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11pre) Gecko/20100508 SeaMonkey/2.0.6pre'\n    family: 'SeaMonkey'\n    major: '2'\n    minor: '0'\n    patch: '6pre'\n```\n\nThe former is pretty straightforward. The text at the end is split into patch. The latter is a little different. To me it would seem patch would just be 6 and the pre lost. But this example the pre is tacked on.\nSo should the standard be \"If you have an extra bit for text that obviously indicates some sort of alpha or beta state it should go into an open attribute if possible. If not it should be appended to the patch attribute.\"\n. If the overall spec is updated just let me know and I'll update the PHP version. I honestly haven't paid that much attention to the repo but I'm happy to keep the port in line with the JS & Python versions.\n. I'll implement the changes and I can have them done within a month of the final spec. That's a conservative estimate.\n. This is a Detector problem. Not ua-parser. Could have sworn someone submitted a patch for it in Detector but I'll double-check.\n. Do you want to take over the port? Serious question. There are spec changes on the horizon and these are a ton of changes. All for the good but I'd rather not be on the hook for managing the project in the future if I accept them.\n. I forgot to say thank you :) I'm traveling so I might a little slow in responding to the changes. I cloned your repo and ran into a dependency problem. I'll get it squared away on my end tomorrow. Sorry, not modern enough I guess ;)\n. @lstrojny no worries on the size. it was definitely needed. i'm behind the times. just let me do due diligence on my end and i'll be back mid-week or so. again, thanks.\n. @tobie -\nCan you please add @lstrojny as a contributor to the ua-parser project? This change is needed but I won't be able to maintain it. I figure @lstrojny's first action could be to accept his own PR. He's already agreed to maintain it going forward. You can then remove me as a contributor. Fun ride but I can't keep it moving forward. Thanks.\n. @AbuJunayd -\nMy ua-classifier project will not be released. While I initially didn't agree with @tobie's decision to remove those attributes I understood the decision better as time moved on. As I worked on it I realized that I wouldn't have time to keep it up. There's a reason commercial products exist in this space ;)\nI'll leave it to others to comment on the best solution. \n. guess i can't put in two pull requests at once...\n. i took the lazy way out but it looked like my stuff would overwhelm the main README. i can always edit it again.\n. done.\n. Francois-\nThanks for submitting the issue. I've updated regexes.yaml & quickly tested the change. Looks good. It also helped me catch an issue with identifying Android device names.\n. @elsigh never done it but it sounds like it might be well worth it. let me play around with the PHP stuff and see what i can get going. leaving this URL here for reference:\nhttp://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/php/\n. Looks like Opera Mini & Opera Mobile aren't following Google's standards for how to identify tablet-based vs. phone-based user-agent strings. I've updated the tablet check to take this into account tho tablet-based versions of these UA strings might be wonky. Need to find some more tests for it. Thanks for the ticket, Erik.\n. for the record, i liked the \"luv ya git\" comment :)\n. I'll get this fixed. Thanks.\n. The notice is fixed but I have a feeling that might not address your issue assuming you tried php UAParser.php -get and still got that notice. It could be that STDIN isn't working in your case. I'm closing the ticket because this issue is addressed. If you find it still doesn't work comment again and I'll re-open. Please include info on your version of PHP and OS. Thanks.\n. Ok, cool :)\n. thanks for fixing these :)\n. Rather than fix regexes.yaml I ended up fixing my PHP lib instead. This way if I forgot parens in the future it won't break again. Thanks much for letting us know about the issue and providing good details.\n. thanks for the fix :)\n. Have you grabbed the latest version of regexes.yaml? I know I fixed this bug a while back. The UA string you provided gets classified correctly as Polaris in my test. You can run your own test by visiting the following website:\nhttp://uaparser.dmolsen.com/\nI'm closing this issue for now. If you find that there is still an error please let me know. Have a good day.\n. This is a problem with a specific test in Modernizr. ua-parser appears to classify the browser correctly. For a longer explanation check out my update on this issue opened on Detector's repo.\n. maybe we could pop the trident version into the build and revision numbers? e.g. IE 8 in compatibility mode would report IE 7.0 but you'd have major=>7, minor=>0, build=>4, revision=>0 so if someone needed to do a check on compat they could by looking at the build/revision numbers. btw, build & revision are what I call those in the php lib. \n. closing this one up. not a huge issue either way.\n. thanks for the fix :)\n. I have a feeling there's something else in the UA that's setting off that check. Can you hit http://uaparser.dmolsen.com for me and copy the results into a comment for this issue, please? Thanks.\n. Stupid question... Are you running IE9 on a tablet pc?\nThe \"Tablet PC 2.0\" string is setting off one of my checks that's really designed for Android tablets. That said, Windows seems to think that it's running on a tablet and if that's the case then having isMobileDevice set to true is actually appropriate. Interestingly enough there seems to be a case for knowing this detail. I'm curious how accurate this bit of data is though. \nIf you could also hit this with IE 9 mode & tell me the results I'd appreciate it.\n. For now I'm leaving the php lib unchanged. It's a bad match but I'm going to err on the side of most versions of Windows that are Tablet PC capable actually being tablets. It's a toss-up I think. The tablet attribute might had to drop completely anyway. Sorry.\n. NetFront is definitely the browser name. See the real product: http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/browser/\nI confused the Vita and Nintendo products. The Vita is it OS. I'm not sure what the \"version number\" is for exactly. I'm not sure it necessarily tracks to a specific version of NetFront. \nI'll close this pull request since I effed it up obviously. Sorry 'bout that.\n. Just wanted to chime in to say I've seen the issue. I'm with @tobie in the sense that I'd hate to break compat but a) it's not the biggest outward change in the world and b) I can see the uses for unit testing (assuming @tobie's suggestion works just as well from a perf perspective). I'm going to try his suggestion just to see what happens.\n. in the short-term i made a fix to the existing lib so that the regexes file is only loaded once. that addresses the perf issue. i think @rjd22 is going in the right direction so i'll keep trying to work in his fixes. i played with this yesterday and found a solution that was backwards compatible but it throws a strict standards error if a dev is running in that mode. i'm going to keep playing around with it but i know i have other stuff that will take me from it for a few weeks.\nbecause of my tweak this pull request can no longer be automatically merged. i forked @rjd22's work so either i'll get a fix in from there or he can submit another pull request if he has a backwards compatible solution. \n. Um... that's embarrassing. Fixed. Thanks.\n. FWIW, the PHP lib classifies this UA as mobile because $ua->family matches a string in my mobile browser array. This info is already available in regexes.yaml as mobile_user_agent_families.\n. I think it's sort of confusing as well. There's a reason I haven't pushed the isMobile etc. back upstream myself. They seemed to be a departure from the original intent of ua-parser which is why I called my lib a pseudo-port (and it still is).\n- isMobile should be thought of as a mobile browser not on a tablet. \n- isMobileDevice can be either a phone or tablet\n- isTablet is just terribly brittle.

Seems like they could just be their own blocks and accessed like the others.\n- mobile browsers\n- mobile OSes\n- mobile devices\n- tablets\nThe only odd lines seem to be:\n- check for android tablet\n- check for tablet\nWhich to me are fragile/brittle and not sure they should stick around honestly. Did I miss anything else that might be specific to the PHP port that should get rolled into the overall YAML file?\n. Will do. :)\n. I don't think keeping this feature in the PHP version is appropriate. I think the PHP library, as written today, is too far away from the original goals of ua-parser. It was written for my needs and those needs don't really match-up with what I assume your and @elsigh's goals are for the project.\nIn order to move forward I think I'll rewrite the PHP lib. I can make it match-up exactly with the output of the other libraries. All of the boolean options can be moved into a separate codebase that I can host. I'll finish v1.5 that I'm working on now to address the pull requests and open issues. After that I'll just strip down the library and do a v2.0 that is a true ua-parser PHP lib.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks.\n. just a heads up that i'm working on merging this and the other pull request from @Synchro locally. thanks for the fixes. i'll leave all of the pull requests to my lib open until i push the final release.\n. This is fixed in the version that I'm working based on your pull requests. I'll leave this open until I push the changes.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks.\n. Looked into this pull request just to see if it could be cleared. The request needs fixing but it may be that the test also needs to be fixed. The basic question is should ua-parser list Android (even modified) as the OS for Kindles as this PR suggests or should we list it as a separate Kindle OS which is what the test currently looks for. \nOlder Kindles are based on Android 2.3. Latest Kindles are based on Android 4.\n. now nuked in my local version. i'll close this issue when i push all of my latest changes to the lib to the repo. thanks.\n. fixed & pushed to the repo. thanks.\n. How do you want the tests? Should I just add tests to the appropriate files in test_resources/ and commit them?\n. I'll wait on this one to be resolved before cleaning up and adding tests for the BB10 UA. Not sure if I screwed something up.\n. ok, i'll clean up this merge and redo the pull request. sorry, tobie.\n. I believe these have been taken out already but this issue wasn't closed. On my phone so can't triple-check but wanted to help keep the clean up  moving :)\nOn Dec 29, 2012, at 7:06 AM, Tobie Langel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@dmolsen can I go ahead and remove this?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @selwin-\n\nFWIW, I've pulled out a lot of the is* code from the PHP lib for a new project, ua-classifier, that sort of mirrors the organization of ua-parser. I've been spending a lot of time trolling logs to find new UAs for regexes.yaml and hopefully can use that for the new project. Maybe you'll find the final YAML file useful for your project too.\n. FWIW, the PHP version, on my local comp, has a 10x speed improvement when using a JSON version of regexes.yaml. \n. The next edition of the PHP lib will be using a JSON version of regexes.yaml. The command line tool I have will fetch and convert the YAML from the repo. \n. What should be the expected results for Windows-related UAs? Pushing XP, Vista, 7, etc to the OS major works except in the case of Windows Phone 7. In that case should the major be 'Phone OS', the minor '7' and, in the case of 7.5, the patch '5'?\nThe following UA currently gets classified as Windows Phone OS:\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; XBLWP7; ZuneWP7)\nThe following UA currently gets classified as Windows Phone OS with a major of 7 and a minor of 5.\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows Phone OS 7.5; Trident/5.0; IEMobile/9.0; NOKIA; Lumia 900)\nI can put in a pull request for the fix once I know the direction that I should take. Or maybe I misunderstood the original issue. \n. We should also try to fit Windows 3.1 into the update as well. The specific version is unrecognized. I figure it's a spoof but I got this lovely UA in my logs this month:\nNCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)\n. I don't believe this project has \"child\" versions of the main YAML file in the individual libs. Or at least they shouldn't. \n. Interesting... the PHP lib returns it as a \"Generic Smartphone\" which, looking at the regexes, is correct. Maybe this is a library specific bug?\n. That stuff came out of my original build and I do case insensitive matching hence why it works with the PHP lib. In the case of MIDP I can add the uppercase version to the regex. I can review the other smartphone choices as well and see if I can get the correct case for them. I'll dig up test cases.\n. All of the search engine regexes will have to be reviewed for case sensitivity too. I should be able to use some of the PHP command line features with my work Apache log files to quickly narrow down those issues. We'll just have to accept that the feature phone regex will be hit or miss tho maybe that can also be addressed with some healthy log parsing as well.\n. This is related to #102. FWIW, what do you think the OS should be? I assume Android but just checking.\n. I'll try to get this addressed and put in a pull request. I think we need to review/fix the Kindle regexes in general.\n. By the way, this is related to issues #102 and #127 \n/cc @elsigh because github decided not to properly link you in the original issue\n. I have the tests and what not written for this. I won't be in a position to drop a pull request until Tuesday. \nOn Dec 29, 2012, at 6:53 AM, Tobie Langel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHere's what I believe we need:\nNon Android OS:\nUA: NetFront \nDevice: Kindle\nOS: Kindle OS\nAndroid OS:\nUA: Amazon Silk\nDevice: Kindle Fire\nOS: Android OS\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Based on my work over the holiday break I feel pretty comfortable saying the following:\n- I can update the Generic Smartphone regexes based on what exists within regexes.yaml to date as well as some examples I've found trolling my logs\n- I can't update the Generic Feature Phone regexes. I don't have any good examples.\n- I can update the Search Bot regexes.\n\nShould we just drop the Feature Phone regex then? And should we move the search bot regexes up to user_agent_parsers? That's my fault for sticking it in the device parsers section when I didn't think my changes would ever be merged with a larger project.\nStill working on this.\n. I'll give those a spin. Only so much time to play against that substantial list though. Hopefully a few of those can be dropped simply because we're already matching their actual device listings.\n. Have at it :)\nOn Dec 29, 2012, at 7:07 AM, Tobie Langel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@dmolsen can I go ahead with this?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I'd like to see this. I'm not sure the current set-up of regexes.yaml can or should handle this though. For example, the primary regexes for this are:\n\n- regex: 'SAMSUNG-([A-Za-z0-9\\-]+)'\n  device_replacement: 'Samsung $1'\n- regex: 'SAMSUNG\\; ([A-Za-z0-9\\-]+)'\n  device_replacement: 'Samsung $1'\nNice and simple. Maybe we could have a separate YAML that allows for specific device to marketing name match-up. If someone needs it they can include it. If not... no extra overhead. The Galaxy S3 has, according to Wikipedia at least, 13 different model numbers for the same marketing name. The Samsung Galaxy S has ~20 different variants of model numbers and marketing names (Wikipedia source). \nAgain, I'd really like to see it and at least some of it could be pulled with effort from sources like Wikipedia.\nDoes anyone have an intern that needs something to do? ;)\n. FWIW, this is the regex that's being tested by the failing test:\n- regex: '(Silk-Accelerated=[a-z]{4,5})'\n  os_replacement: 'Android'\nAnd this is the result I get for that UA locally in the PHP lib:\nua->family: Amazon Silk\nua->major: 2\nua->minor: 2\nua->patch: \nua->toString: Amazon Silk 2.2\nua->toVersionString: 2.2\nos->family: Android\nos->major: \nos->minor: \nos->patch: \nos->patch_minor: \nos->toString: Android\nos->toVersionString: \ndevice->family: Kindle Fire HD\ntoFullString: Amazon Silk 2.2/Android\nuaOriginal: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; en-us; KFTT Build/IML74K) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Silk/2.2 Safari/535.19 Silk-Accelerated=true\nSorry, not sure what I'm breaking.\n. Works for me. Yet another lesson learned. Sorry.\n. I don't get the error in PHP 5.3.19 or PHP 5.3.17. I'm running in strict mode so I would assume this error would fire. I also replicated your error reporting and didn't get it. Rather than having those public functions (uaParser(), osParser(), and deviceParser) end in an r I can just remove it. That will remove any naming issues/conflicts but keep a certain consistency.\nAnd I don't think strict errors shouldn't be firing on that version of PHP and your reporting level. Baffled but it's a relatively easy fix in case others might run into the same thing.\nThe fix should be in this evening.\n. @pmailer-\nThe feature will be making a comeback in a new project called ua-classifier. I just needed to clean up the ua-parser lib to match everyone else. You should be able to continue using the older version of the library for now just fine. I apologize for the big change.\n. So what you're looking at in the ua-parser repository currently is a different version than what testswarm is using. testswarm is using 1.x and the repo is 2.x. There is no JSON file in the ua-parser repo. The JSON file is built using the 2.x version of the PHP lib. \nI believe your issue is at line #69 of your version of uaparser-cli.php. Please remove the @ before file_get_contents(). That should then throw an error for you. Also, please make sure allow_url_fopen is set to true in your PHP configuration.\n. Since you haven't chimed in on this I'm going to close this issue up. Feel free to open if you have further questions/issues.\n. fixity fixed\n. just wanted to let you know i've seen this. just haven't had a chance to merge it. looks like a lot of whitespace changes so i want to address that first. btw, if you have changes to regexes.yaml that might help everyone please feel free to do a pull request with tests.\n. While I think the ideal is that users contribute back I think the reality is that they patch and never contribute. I've heard this from a few devs. I'm not sure offering the option is any more encouragement to patch regexes.yaml than without the feature honestly. It's going to happen regardless.\nHell, keeping their patches separate but building a comparison tool might even help show folks that they can/should contribute regexes back.\n. Hand added this. Local git pull was being silly and not allowing me to merge your changes sans white space issues.\n. i'll get this added over the weekend.\n. Hand added this. Local git pull was being silly and not allowing me to merge your changes sans white space issues.\n. I think there needs be some discussion regarding this. I would argue that we should change the Wii browser to return Opera since that's what it really is. The Wii U should return NetFront NX because that's the real browser for it. Device should then return Wii U or Wii as appropriate. \nFor tests I have some written up for the Wii U but they match my interpretation of browser, OS (which I've put as 'Other'), and device for it. At least it's a start.\nWii info: http://console.maban.co.uk/device/wii.php\nWii U info: http://console.maban.co.uk/device/wiiu.php\nMy tests: https://github.com/dmolsen/ua-parser/compare/master...do-nintendo-wii-u\n. I'm not sure this is truly what the OS is called... \nhttp://wiiudaily.com/wii-u-operating-system/\nWant me to go with that? It's been difficult finding OS names for game systems. Also, before I put in a PR I'd like to suggest a different way of doing it. I have 24 branches at the moment with more UAs/tests that I need to add and they don't all merge nicely. I need to clean-up the concept a little bit today and then I'll put in an issue bout it.\n. @elsigh -\ni went through the old issues list last week and pulled out the ones we weren't properly matching. i hope to have them committed this weekend. i can go back and close them up like i've done in the past if you like.\n. this also address issue #158 \n. The existing test files don't appear to be in alphabetical order. I agree that would help assuming they were already ordered correctly.\n. Thanks to @tobie for handling my many pull requests so far. I just wanted to give you both an update about where I was with them. After these three PRs that are in the queue I still need to add tests and put in PRs for the following items. \nMost of the following have tests and I have UAs for all of these. I have seen these in production logs:\n- ~~Add: Huawei devices~~\n- ~~Add: ICE Browser~~\n- ~~Add: Power PC Mac OS~~\n- ~~Add: Openwave browser~~\n- ~~Add: QQ browser~~\n- ~~Add: Solaris~~\n- Add: Micromax devices\n- ~~Add: VRE (virtual runtime environment, a pseudo-os)~~\n- ~~Add: Phantom browser~~\n- ~~Add: WebTV~~\n- ~~Add: OneBrowser~~\n- ~~Add: iBrowser~~\n- Add: J2ME (for Opera UAs)\n- ~~Add: Baidu Desktop~~\n- Fix: Netscape 6\n- Fix: UP.browser\n- ~~Fix: webOS~~\n- ~~Fix: HTC devices~~\n- Fix: update the list of generic smartphones matches so their case is correct\nBased on the issues open in the original ua-parser repo I have to update the following:\n- Add: Fast browser\n- ~~Add: yandex browser~~\n- Add: Firefox Tablet\n- Fix: Mathon\n- Fix: Seamonkey version numbers\nBased on trolling around I've found the following that we should add (I have UAs from user-agent-string.info or their official sites):\n- Add: Doris browser\n- Add: Go Browser\n- Add: Xbox\n- Add: Nook\n- Add: Boxee\n- Add: Opera on HbbTV\n- Add: Skyfire browser\n- Add: NineSky browser\n- ~~Add: Firefox OS~~\nI still need to find Roku and SmartTV UAs.\nI also have a bunch of extraneous UAs broken down into groups but they don't need to be added. I wanted to open another issue about them:\n- W3C validators\n- Search Bots (which I will use to update the list we have)\n- Social Media Bots\n- RSS Readers\n- Google-specific UAs\n- Multimedia applications\n- Link Checkers\n- A few traditional desktop apps\n. Short of adding these all in one go and comparing perf I can't really say. Again, I wouldn't add the last list of options (the W3C validators, etc.). I think this sounds like a lot of additions but won't end up being that many. At the very least the majority are modern browsers.\nI think libs switching to JSON (if appropriate) and reorganizing/cleaning up the file will go a long way to really improving performance (see #162). Their are bots listed pretty high in the ua parse section, I'm sure their are UAs that can be combined into those longer patterns, and the devices are currently alphabetized (for the most part) so maybe those need to be moved around. I wanted to get stuff added first and then tackle that part.\nDefinitely agree with the concern though :) The NCSA Mosaic must have been a spoof in my production logs but it's still kind of fun to say ua-parser will recognize it even if it is a little overhead ;)\n. @elsigh you might also want to run these tests. i know the PHP lib doesn't support the chrome frame tests so I'd like to make sure I didn't bork anything with them when i alphabetized.\n. Can this PR be reviewed and merged if appropriate, please? Once it's merged I can then get moving again on getting the updated UA matches and tests pulled in as well.\n. @tobie \nthe files were built with a simple PHP script that took the originals, parsed the YAML, sorted on a key built out of a lowercased combination of family, major, minor, patch, and patch minor attributes as available and then kicked out new YAML files. this is why the comments and any data that had been specifically commented out is gone.\nobviously the UAs and attributes match up because it's passing tests. otherwise the data matches up:\n- test_device.yaml - 56 lines, 3.2K ( original | mine )\n- additional_os_tests.yaml - 149 lines, 4.7-8K ( original | mine )\n- test_user_agent_parser.yaml - 444 lines (if you account for commented out/extra lines in original) ( original | mine )\n- test_user_agent_parser_os.yaml - 426 lines (if you account for commented out/extra lines in original) ( original | mine )\nthe firefox set of tests are just completely redone because the original is missing lines between the tests.\nanother simple PHP script confirms that each file has the exact same number of and same string matches for the UA tests between your repo's test files and my fork's test files.\n. Ok, I see the error. PHP lib cleans up underscores. Forgot about that. Should the result be Amaze_4G or Amaze _4G (that's a space)? The Travis error looks like the latter.\n. Bad match on NOKIA. Fixing it.\n. I don't think underscores have any real meaning. I would just treat it as part of a larger string for that attribute. As in this case minor is 2_7. \"a,\" \"b,\" or \"pre\" have a little more meaning to me as a dev and I can see splitting them. Unfortunately it looks like regexes.yaml handles this issue in conflicting ways. I think this is related to if their are any open attributes or not. Two good examples:\n```\n  - user_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.3a4pre) Gecko/20100404 SeaMonkey/2.1a1pre'\n    family: 'SeaMonkey'\n    major: '2'\n    minor: '1'\n    patch: 'a1pre'\n\nuser_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11pre) Gecko/20100508 SeaMonkey/2.0.6pre'\n    family: 'SeaMonkey'\n    major: '2'\n    minor: '0'\n    patch: '6pre'\n```\n\nThe former is pretty straightforward. The text at the end is split into patch. The latter is a little different. To me it would seem patch would just be 6 and the pre lost. But this example the pre is tacked on.\nSo should the standard be \"If you have an extra bit for text that obviously indicates some sort of alpha or beta state it should go into an open attribute if possible. If not it should be appended to the patch attribute.\"\n. If the overall spec is updated just let me know and I'll update the PHP version. I honestly haven't paid that much attention to the repo but I'm happy to keep the port in line with the JS & Python versions.\n. I'll implement the changes and I can have them done within a month of the final spec. That's a conservative estimate.\n. This is a Detector problem. Not ua-parser. Could have sworn someone submitted a patch for it in Detector but I'll double-check.\n. Do you want to take over the port? Serious question. There are spec changes on the horizon and these are a ton of changes. All for the good but I'd rather not be on the hook for managing the project in the future if I accept them.\n. I forgot to say thank you :) I'm traveling so I might a little slow in responding to the changes. I cloned your repo and ran into a dependency problem. I'll get it squared away on my end tomorrow. Sorry, not modern enough I guess ;)\n. @lstrojny no worries on the size. it was definitely needed. i'm behind the times. just let me do due diligence on my end and i'll be back mid-week or so. again, thanks.\n. @tobie -\nCan you please add @lstrojny as a contributor to the ua-parser project? This change is needed but I won't be able to maintain it. I figure @lstrojny's first action could be to accept his own PR. He's already agreed to maintain it going forward. You can then remove me as a contributor. Fun ride but I can't keep it moving forward. Thanks.\n. @AbuJunayd -\nMy ua-classifier project will not be released. While I initially didn't agree with @tobie's decision to remove those attributes I understood the decision better as time moved on. As I worked on it I realized that I wouldn't have time to keep it up. There's a reason commercial products exist in this space ;)\nI'll leave it to others to comment on the best solution. \n. ",

I'm in need of the device property in node as well and noticed this PR has been open for 2 months now. @shripadk, You haven't documented the device prop in your PR but from what I can see now it only returns a string? @tobie Wouldn't it be preferable to have a similar output format for all languages?\n. @shripadk The device property is returned as Object with isMobile and isSpider inside in other languages. For example, java:\njava\n  System.out.println(c.device.family);    // => \"iPhone\"\n  System.out.println(c.device.isMobile);  // => true\n  System.out.println(c.device.isSpider);  // => false\n. I would suggest like @tobie to split this one up:\n1. Changes in regexes.yaml.\n2. Improved device property.\n3. The addition of the attributes majorInt and minorInt (or something like that) to the UserAgent object.\n. @shripadk The changes look good but I can still see tobie's point considering the fact that there are a lot of lines in there not directly related to this fix. (for example the expansion of the UserAgent function).

I just tried installing ua_parser on my Mac and it seems to be working fine, my Ubuntu development and production boxes (12.04) at work was also able to successfully install this package via pip, with virtualenv.\nI'm worried that we will break installation on some other distros/setup if we merge https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/213 in. I think the best solution would be to try and locate regexes.yaml at both ROOT_DIR and DATA_DIR.\nWhat do you think @elsigh ? \n. I'll try to work on a patch and open a pull request tonight.\n.

Alright, let me know how it goes. Thanks!\n. @rascalking Installed just fine on Ubuntu 10.04 with Python 2.6 :+1: \n. @rascalking should open a PR. \nAs for PyPI relase, @rascalking's  commits are made on top of the current master branch with failing tests.

I'd like to tinker with this a bit and just want to make sure that my changes don't cause any regressions.\n. Does it work if you install it using virtualenv? I suspect this is due to your distro tampering with Python's installation layout, similar to https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/160 .\n@hackeron what Linux distro are you installing ua-parser on? We'll need more information on where regexes.yaml gets copied to during installation.\n. It seems like pyyaml failed to install. See this line here:\ngcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/usr/include/python2.7 -c build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/check_libyaml.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/check_libyaml.o\nbuild/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/check_libyaml.c:2:18: fatal error: yaml.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\n. I just tried installing ua_parser on my Mac and it seems to be working fine, my Ubuntu development and production boxes (12.04) at work was also able to successfully install this package via pip, with virtualenv.\nI'm worried that we will break installation on some other distros/setup if we merge https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/213 in. I think the best solution would be to try and locate regexes.yaml at both ROOT_DIR and DATA_DIR.\nWhat do you think @elsigh ? \n. I'll try to work on a patch and open a pull request tonight.\n. I'm working on a patch to fix python version on Fedora, but found that the current master has test failures. My plan is to now create a branch from the current release on PyPI. Mind creating a python-stable branch based on commit c4541daee8db4aac97723512983cb0fa09cf13d4 so I can open a pull request to that branch?\nOr alternatively, if you don't mind please give me push access to this repo so I can more easily keep the PyPI version in sync (I'm the current maintainer of the ua-parser's PyPI package).\n. I have uploaded the fix to my ua-parser repo https://github.com/selwin/ua-parser \n@rascalking can you try installing it with pip install -e git+git://github.com/selwin/ua-parser.git#egg=ua-parser and check if it now works on Fedora?\n. @rascalking no reason other than ignorance :). Alright, let me know how it goes. Thanks!\n. @rascalking Installed just fine on Ubuntu 10.04 with Python 2.6 :+1: \n. @rascalking should open a PR. \nAs for PyPI relase, @rascalking's  commits are made on top of the current master branch with failing tests. My plan is to pull in @rascalking's  installation related commits on top of my stable python branch and upload it to pypi as a bug fix release. Is that acceptable to you @tobie and @elsigh ?\n. @georgevreilly try installing pyyaml first. It chocked on this line:\n``` python\n File \"/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py\", line 24, in run\nimport yaml\n\nImportError: No module named yaml\n``\n. @malicustommade I'm not a repo conntributor so I can't merge this in. Can @elsigh or @tobie help?\n. @elsigh if everything is in order, mind pulling this in? I'd like to make a PyPI release soon since the current PyPI version doesn't recognise Opera 15.\n. Looks good to me. When this is merged, I'll release a new version on PyPI with bundledregexes.json`.\n. That's because I haven't had the time to upload it to PyPI yet. I'll try to\ndo it this weekend.

Thanks to @commenthol the perl port is already done, I'm waiting the approval of this PR to merge the changes, I'm also ready to make any changes to meet the full specifications within a week if required.\nAccording to the specifications \"brand shall name the manufacturer of the device\" I think you're right, device.manufacturer sounds better, but again as @nielsbasjes pointed above, what we should get for example with \"Google Nexus 7\" where many manufacturers produced the same device?\n. I agree with @tobie tagging will be much better than splitting, everything else looks well organized :+1: \n. @parcolee I think you're using the perl port, I just test it with the current regex and the out put\nDevice family    : Other\nBrowser family   : Android\nOS family        : Android\n@Ironholds can you confirm if this is a bug in the perl port? I'm not totally sure what should be the output of that user agent or if it could be parsed at all, as the perl port pass all tests of javascript and python, can you test with any other port and update me with the output?\n. Am I blind? I can only see one user agent \"Samsung SM-N9005 stagefright/1.2 (Linux;Android 4.4.2)\" where is the second one :(\nSorry for the confusion by saying \"can you confirm if it's a perl bug\" I meant to test with the port you're using and let me know if it captures the device, I wasn't sure because you said \"the current regex shouldn't catch that\".\n. oh, good catch.. OK since this is the standard for Samsung devices then I guess \"Other\" is the expected behavior.\n. Not sure, travis doesn't show a good indication, I tested against perl and here's what I got\n#          got: 'Samsung C3053/1.0 '\n #     expected: 'Samsung C3053'\nThe failing test appears to come from test_device.yaml\n.

Yep, although if we're talking about the Python implementation specifically, implementations are meant to follow a common standard.

In that case the bits that can be fixed have patches in and this is..unnecessarily open, I guess?\nThanks for the patch. Closing :)\n. It would be really, really great to have this supported; as it is the ua-parser systemically misses iOS versions :(.\n. @antonioribeiro @commenthol @mrjgreen @puzrin @toolmantim etc: we've started an IRC channel for realtime discussion and a mailing list to discuss issues that come up, and the first thing we should work on is where this project is going architecturally. Please join up and join in!\n. I like these ideas very much! Can I suggest merging your Lua port back into ua-parser so that others can use it, as well?\n. @switzer we're kicking off a conversation about architectural changes, and I think yours (particularly the ordering by popularity, where possible) are good'uns. Want to chip in?\n. @sandinmyjoints examining. Are you actively porting the yaml file updates to the live example?\n. Er. Git clone, grab the YAML file, upload it to your machine ;p. I'm not saying \"update automatically and live\", just an assurance that updates are being ported on a regular basis: otherwise linking is probably not tremendously useful (a live example of a project that doesn't actually provide represent the current state of the project...)\n. Sounds reasonable! Okay, will merge :). Thanks for the submission, and sorry it took so long to get comment - I'm going to make an effort to try and respond speedily to new issues and pull requests.\n. @sjiang comments/assists? Otherwise I'll probably have to just close this off (bug in the patch nobody here knows how to fix + substantially out of date).\n. Rebase it and solve for the conflict, and I'll trust you to know what you're doing around the pig setup. Solved :).\n. @nielsbasjes Yeah, not since the set of patches we merged, ooh, last week ;p.\nYes, historically it's been a struggle for collaborators to find the time to merge patches and do work. We solved for this by adding more collaborators. Let me know if you're interested in rewriting and I'll merge if in if it passes the tests. Alternately, let me know if you're not interested in the timesink and I'll close it. Up to you.\n. I've actually put together a pseudo-R port just by writing a quick rPython-dependent function. I can see a good argument for a 'pure' R port...but I also worry it'd be hella-slow.\n. Makes sense! I guess when in doubt, there's always 'implement big chunks of it in C' ;p.\n. Indeed, but then you're creating more dependencies, and also inconsistencies in how things are called. I'm thinking particularly of the Rcpp sourcing changes in the last couple of versions, which aren't workable on the current Ubuntu LTS....which is what a lot of web properties consider the staple for their machines. Anyway, I'll quit overthinking; an R version would be awesome to have :D\n. Okay, if nobody else is already doing it, I'm going to work on this next weekend; I've got a pretty good idea of how to write a raw R version, and we can iterate from there on using C++ to natively vectorise the operation.\n. Nope; took one look, winced, and realised it was a lot cheaper (and a lot faster) to build a conduit to Python :/.\n. Now done largely pulling from the C++ implementation and using ua-parser to tie the two together. @zachmayer ping.\n. Just going to straight merge; by definition this can't break anything if it doesn't work ;p.\n@asuhan thanks for the submission! Sorry it took so long to get handled.\n. Grand!\n. #434 should (should) fix this.\n. floydsoft's commit should've fixed this issue.\n. #434 I believe handles the same thing.\n. I..wish there was some kind of thanks or upvote button on github; this is one of my two bugbears with ua-parser, and the only one of the two I couldn't easily fix at my end...and you've patched it. Thank you so much :).\n(Someone approve this darn pull already ;p)\n. Quite a few, yes, and in most cases. They're relatively distinguishable from each other if different device/family results for different feed readers would be desired. I've got a 5 billion entry requestlog from yesterday sat in front of me if you want me to pull out examples.\n. Well, yes. See \"Does this seem useful to anyone? If so, I'll take a stab at implementing it myself.\" (emphasis mine)\n. Can I get this merged, please? :)\n. Thanks! I've got a couple more spiders I can now throw in :).\n. Ditto with the \"Submit a Bug\" link at the bottom, \n. Sure; one moment whole I gradually wake up ;).\n. Done, passed.\n. \"Squashing\"?\n. Gotcha!\n. Thanks!\n. @moshjeier what's with the random W in \"Firefox Mobile\"?\n. Alright, no reply and no github activity in a long while; closing.\n. Merged; sorry for the delay!\n. Soo..what's with the big delay in people closing pull requests?\n. @tobie ?\n. Danke! :).\nWould it make sense to add extra members to the project who are more available, with the understanding that it's primarily for regex improvements rather than substantive codebase changes?\n. Gotcha. Still, most welcome :). Would setting up a non-github-issues way of collaborating be an idea? That way we can sort of get people together and have long-form conversations around making that change (if there's already a mailing list or something and I've missed it, my bad)\n. Looks good to me - @sjiang do you have any comments as the Java maintainer?\n. Looks now fixed by #434 \n. Oh balls. extraneous pipe. Wait one ;p.\n. So this, then, is #323 still - not an independent issue. Sorry about the lack of updates - there's some work going on to simplify and improve the project structure which should make problems like this easier to resolve.\n. Yes, it does appear to work in Python 3. I'm not sure if this is a deliberate or accidental feature ;p. I'll push in some new classifiers.\n. @klimashkin see commenthol's tweak suggestion.\n. Danke! :)\n. @emidln 's patch should have fixed this, I believe - #434 \n. What would the utility of a client-side ua parser be? Unless you mean passing the information back to the server and simply foisting the computational challenge off on users.\n. Well, it certainly wouldn't be applicable for non-JS clients, but ;p. I don't know in what circumstances it would be possible or not possible, but I don't think a client side version is likely to be developed soon. And, speaking as a user rather than a ua-parser-sort-of-maintainer, I also don't think it's fair. You're streaming them kind of a lot of data - all the JS, the entire YAML file - to do a single check of their user agent.\n. @nidico spider is now a value in the device family entry.\n. Hrm. Presumably the solution here would be actively moving the IE identifying regexes in the YAML file so that they're first; can anyone think of a reason why this would bork things? Other plausible browser strings that are dependent on IE being after [other regex]?\n. Thanks :)\n. @ryancwarren thanks for the patch! :)\n. Good commit! @tobie  you're the maintainer of the JS version; looks good?\n. @angelajiang does the dataset actually contain device_type?\n. @angelajiang I think it would! Actually I'm working on a dataset mapping ua-parser's devices to device_types right now. My worry is whether the YAML file is set up to allow for this easily (are there existing regular expressions that catch devices with varying types?).\n. @gquinones thanks for the great patch! Merged :).\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Failing OsParser fixed in a distinct patch, and as a result these can't be merged; please do resubmit if other changes are useful, though :).\n. @emidln Thanks for the patch! :)\n. blinks. You're running out of memory trying to allocate 20 bytes? Could this be a system problem?\n. The relevant Composer bug thread is suggesting (1) it's an error with your Composer setup and (2) your PHP setup. Try fixing those and see what happens?\n. @parcolee did the PHP changes help?\n. Er. What? They're the same file. One is just stored \"raw\" - i.e., with the formatting in the file, rather than the formatting in the file subject to GitHub's frontend formatting.\n. They should contain exactly the same things. \"raw\", again, means, \"give me the file as it actually appears, not as it appears with GitHub's formatting\". They should contain exactly the same things. If you download the first file, and copy the content of the second page into a file, they should be identical files. There's no difference.\n. Well, the current regex shouldn't catch that; what's it providing for os/browser/etc?\n. \"passes all tests of javascript and python\"? I'm not a perl programmer so absent doing exactly what you did I'm not entirely sure what I can do there ;p. \nThe first user agent provided by percolee indeed produces Other/Android/Android, in python. The second one actually catches a device type. This is to unsurprising because the first agent isn't actually a browser - it's a component of Samsung's Android OS variant used to process audio and video files. They evidently haven't standardised the user agent there, as they have in a lot of other places.\n. For the second one see \"when broswer HTML5 audio player ( tag) load a forced download php file (output content-type audio/mpeg or audio/ogg), I caught from there.\nif just a simple text hyperlink ( tag) to the same forced download php url, it caught:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; zh-hk; SAMSUNG SM-N9005 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/1.5 Chrome/28.0.1500.94 Mobile Safari/537.36\"\nI mean literally, I read the YAML. The current regex looks for SAMSUNG in all caps for Samsung devices, because that's how Samsung have standardised theirs; evidently they didn't standardise for in-OS modules.\n. Okay. You say \"would\" - What does the first UA (SAMSUNG SM-N...) currently come out as?\n. No. I mean that you're saying \"X user agent would become Y breakdown\". Hypotheticals are nice but how does it currently come out?\n. Thanks!\n. @cxmcc Mind crunching it into a single commit?\n. @cxmcc thanks! And thanks for the patch :)\n. Can you describe the spider?\n. Good point! How odd. I've run some tests at my end and it seems to be catching the appropriate bots even when they're removed from being explicitly noted in the regex. Lemme make a patch...\n. @cjnoyes Merging is not possible; could you rebase and resubmit?\n. Hrm; build fail. Ideas?\n(Also, please compress into a single commit, if possible?)\n. Yeah; it looks like this test is causing the problem. Your regex is including the /1.0, whereas the existing device test isn't expecting it. Hrn. I guess the test was designed for this existing regex?\n. Uhm: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml#L627-L628 - can you give an example string that isn't being caught?\n. Gotcha. cool! Thanks :)\n. Thanks!\n. The only recent update was this, and I can't see any changes to the range of syntax found in the file.\n. Also note that ua-parser is deprecated as a place to throw new changes.\n. Thanks! Sorry for such a long delay.\n. I did:\n device      os browser major_version minor_version\nOther Solaris   Other         Other         Other\nWhat exact functionality is broken?\n. @floydsoft what's passed?\n. If you mean \"the code works\": sure. But again, I'm not seeing, in the existing implementation, errors caused with the example string you've provided. What should be happening that isn't?\n. Okay; this makes it more clear ;p. So, in the future, you want a comment like \"In python 3.4, match detection breaks when...\"\n. Well, I'm also an analyst and I've submitted a lot; it's not particularly hard :). But I'll go through and take a look. I'm slightly confused by what you mean by \"detected as mobile\": the browser, as \"Mobile [browsername]\"? Or distinguishing desktop/mobile devices? Because ua-parser doesn't do the latter.\n. Looks like it to me! Want to write a patch?\nThanks for finding them!\n. Thanks!\n. A hard question! All \"other\" means is \"the user agent does not give enough information to identify a device\". This could mean:\n1. It's a desktop device, or;\n2. It's a mobile device that the regexes don't know about yet, or;\n3. It's a mobile device with a silly user agent.\nI'm not aware of any work that looks at the rate of each. But I'm currently working on a repository that matches ua-parser's \"device\" output to device_class, where that's tablet/phone/other. Something you might want to help out with/be notified about?\n. (Ignoring the unmatched parens, which I'll fix if people don't disapprove of the underlying idea)\n. Huh. And the test still fails, but I can't see /where/. Anyone got thoughts?\n. Hmn; define \"headless\" in this context? I'm trying to pick a commonsensical word. And yeah, we should separately have the travis output report more usefully; bah :/.\n. Hrm. Scrapy example needs fixing, but I can't for the life of me work out why libwww-perl/5.834 is triggering \"generic feature phone\" (the numeric values?)\n. Not directly mergeable; could you rebase and ideally crunch it into fewer commits?\n. Yeep. Or not :(\nOn Thu, Nov 6, 2014 at 4:58 AM, commenthol notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSorry for selecting the wrong branch.

We're starting off an Actual Honest To Gods Discussion Venue for working out where the project is going - tobie's going to /temporarily/ revert this, and then we can kick off the bigger conversation about what's going to happen, what you'd like, what I'd like, what random user 456 would like, and hopefully fit this into that to boot. Sorry if this feels like nixing a ton of hard work; it's tremendously appreciated and really cool :D.\n. Do you have an example user agent?\n. I'm confused; that does produce a valid output:\n\ndevice    os   browser major_version minor_version\nOther Linux Iceweasel            35             0\n\nAre you instead arguing that it should be considered equivalent to Firefox?\n. So, that's a \"yes\". I don't really have an opinion on this - I think it's reasonable given the use cases ua-parser is supposed to have. @commenthol, @tobie ?\n. I think that's a fair assessment. Capabilities are best extracted by looking at the provided engine information, which we don't parse except to extract browser implementation names.\n. Well, it has a domain - http://www.uaparser.org/\n. We're currently working through a rework of the project, so the current version is not likely to remain \"the version\" for long. I'd suggest popping over to the org as a whole or the associated mailing list and asking there?\n. @jdalton: patched in the new org/library\n. Yay! @selwin have you seen the ua-parser org? We're trying to push people over to that.\n. Thanks!\n. Yes; the current implementation is dependent on the libyaml 0.3 API, not the 0.5, which has a different structure (hence lacking GetNextDocument). \n. If you want to rewrite the C++? Sure - but that's probably not necessary since 0.3 and 0.5 are very deliberately released as distinct distributions, and can exist side-by-side.\n. I am not responsible for that particular decision ;p. And....well, read them? Yes, they're different files containing different methods for different classes. You should probably be mostly interacting with main (or using it as an example of the internal workings, at least).\n. Feel free to submit patches; again, I didn't write it, I just beat it with a stick until it works.\n. You opened two different issues. Closing this one.\n. It can; see this repository for the current YAML file.\nI'm going to take this bug as yet another reminder that we have to actually point people to the new repo, and update the readme et al now :/\n.  The project has been split up into multiple repositories; could you resbumit your pull request here?\n. Ta!\n. I suspect no. @tobie ?\n. ...yes. What do you think it should be doing?\n. And it knows that it's a desktop how? And, PC is a specific model, how?\nThe entire point of \"other\" is \"the user agent does not include an explicit string identifying the device model, so we can't provide that device model\". Desktop browsers don't do that; there's no way to determine if it's a PC, or a Mac, or a netbook, or, as you note, an older phone. The parser can only work from the information that's actually in the user agent.\n. Except the goal is to identify specific device models, not device classes, and you haven't explained how it would \"simply\" do this (or provided example user agents which would allow this information to be extracted, and have a problem).\n. Except, again, the goal is to identify devices, not device classes, and OS is not uniformly a mapper to the actual hardware. Nor is it uniformly a mapper to a single class of hardware.\n. No; there isn't a project for that that I'm aware of. It has been discussed as a future feature but we haven't started work on it yet.\n.

We're gathering number 3, and yes, the order definitely matters right - that's why we have to accept either additional complexity (which is fine. It's the sort of thing JSON and YAML are designed for) or inaccuracy.\n. So, why don't we memoise and cache rather than changing the order? ;)\n. Yep, although if we're talking about the Python implementation specifically, implementations are meant to follow a common standard. I'm not sure if that applies to things that don't change the user outcome. @tobie ?\n. Alrighty! @mhemesath , patch away :D\n. Issues not addressed since May 2013, so closing.\n. In that case the bits that can be fixed have patches in and this is..unnecessarily open, I guess?\nThanks for the patch. Closing :)\n. It would be really, really great to have this supported; as it is the ua-parser systemically misses iOS versions :(.\n. @antonioribeiro @commenthol @mrjgreen @puzrin @toolmantim etc: we've started an IRC channel for realtime discussion and a mailing list to discuss issues that come up, and the first thing we should work on is where this project is going architecturally. Please join up and join in!\n. I like these ideas very much! Can I suggest merging your Lua port back into ua-parser so that others can use it, as well?\n. @switzer we're kicking off a conversation about architectural changes, and I think yours (particularly the ordering by popularity, where possible) are good'uns. Want to chip in?\n. @sandinmyjoints examining. Are you actively porting the yaml file updates to the live example?\n. Er. Git clone, grab the YAML file, upload it to your machine ;p. I'm not saying \"update automatically and live\", just an assurance that updates are being ported on a regular basis: otherwise linking is probably not tremendously useful (a live example of a project that doesn't actually provide represent the current state of the project...)\n. Sounds reasonable! Okay, will merge :). Thanks for the submission, and sorry it took so long to get comment - I'm going to make an effort to try and respond speedily to new issues and pull requests.\n. @sjiang comments/assists? Otherwise I'll probably have to just close this off (bug in the patch nobody here knows how to fix + substantially out of date).\n. Rebase it and solve for the conflict, and I'll trust you to know what you're doing around the pig setup. Solved :).\n. @nielsbasjes Yeah, not since the set of patches we merged, ooh, last week ;p.\nYes, historically it's been a struggle for collaborators to find the time to merge patches and do work. We solved for this by adding more collaborators. Let me know if you're interested in rewriting and I'll merge if in if it passes the tests. Alternately, let me know if you're not interested in the timesink and I'll close it. Up to you.\n. I've actually put together a pseudo-R port just by writing a quick rPython-dependent function. I can see a good argument for a 'pure' R port...but I also worry it'd be hella-slow.\n. Makes sense! I guess when in doubt, there's always 'implement big chunks of it in C' ;p.\n. Indeed, but then you're creating more dependencies, and also inconsistencies in how things are called. I'm thinking particularly of the Rcpp sourcing changes in the last couple of versions, which aren't workable on the current Ubuntu LTS....which is what a lot of web properties consider the staple for their machines. Anyway, I'll quit overthinking; an R version would be awesome to have :D\n. Okay, if nobody else is already doing it, I'm going to work on this next weekend; I've got a pretty good idea of how to write a raw R version, and we can iterate from there on using C++ to natively vectorise the operation.\n. Nope; took one look, winced, and realised it was a lot cheaper (and a lot faster) to build a conduit to Python :/.\n. Now done largely pulling from the C++ implementation and using ua-parser to tie the two together. @zachmayer ping.\n. Just going to straight merge; by definition this can't break anything if it doesn't work ;p.\n@asuhan thanks for the submission! Sorry it took so long to get handled.\n. Grand!\n. #434 should (should) fix this.\n. floydsoft's commit should've fixed this issue.\n. #434 I believe handles the same thing.\n. I..wish there was some kind of thanks or upvote button on github; this is one of my two bugbears with ua-parser, and the only one of the two I couldn't easily fix at my end...and you've patched it. Thank you so much :).\n(Someone approve this darn pull already ;p)\n. Quite a few, yes, and in most cases. They're relatively distinguishable from each other if different device/family results for different feed readers would be desired. I've got a 5 billion entry requestlog from yesterday sat in front of me if you want me to pull out examples.\n. Well, yes. See \"Does this seem useful to anyone? If so, I'll take a stab at implementing it myself.\" (emphasis mine)\n. Can I get this merged, please? :)\n. Thanks! I've got a couple more spiders I can now throw in :).\n. Ditto with the \"Submit a Bug\" link at the bottom, \n. Sure; one moment whole I gradually wake up ;).\n. Done, passed.\n. \"Squashing\"?\n. Gotcha!\n. Thanks!\n. @moshjeier what's with the random W in \"Firefox Mobile\"?\n. Alright, no reply and no github activity in a long while; closing.\n. Merged; sorry for the delay!\n. Soo..what's with the big delay in people closing pull requests?\n. @tobie ?\n. Danke! :).\nWould it make sense to add extra members to the project who are more available, with the understanding that it's primarily for regex improvements rather than substantive codebase changes?\n. Gotcha. Still, most welcome :). Would setting up a non-github-issues way of collaborating be an idea? That way we can sort of get people together and have long-form conversations around making that change (if there's already a mailing list or something and I've missed it, my bad)\n. Looks good to me - @sjiang do you have any comments as the Java maintainer?\n. Looks now fixed by #434 \n. Oh balls. extraneous pipe. Wait one ;p.\n. So this, then, is #323 still - not an independent issue. Sorry about the lack of updates - there's some work going on to simplify and improve the project structure which should make problems like this easier to resolve.\n. Yes, it does appear to work in Python 3. I'm not sure if this is a deliberate or accidental feature ;p. I'll push in some new classifiers.\n. @klimashkin see commenthol's tweak suggestion.\n. Danke! :)\n. @emidln 's patch should have fixed this, I believe - #434 \n. What would the utility of a client-side ua parser be? Unless you mean passing the information back to the server and simply foisting the computational challenge off on users.\n. Well, it certainly wouldn't be applicable for non-JS clients, but ;p. I don't know in what circumstances it would be possible or not possible, but I don't think a client side version is likely to be developed soon. And, speaking as a user rather than a ua-parser-sort-of-maintainer, I also don't think it's fair. You're streaming them kind of a lot of data - all the JS, the entire YAML file - to do a single check of their user agent.\n. @nidico spider is now a value in the device family entry.\n. Hrm. Presumably the solution here would be actively moving the IE identifying regexes in the YAML file so that they're first; can anyone think of a reason why this would bork things? Other plausible browser strings that are dependent on IE being after [other regex]?\n. Thanks :)\n. @ryancwarren thanks for the patch! :)\n. Good commit! @tobie  you're the maintainer of the JS version; looks good?\n. @angelajiang does the dataset actually contain device_type?\n. @angelajiang I think it would! Actually I'm working on a dataset mapping ua-parser's devices to device_types right now. My worry is whether the YAML file is set up to allow for this easily (are there existing regular expressions that catch devices with varying types?).\n. @gquinones thanks for the great patch! Merged :).\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Failing OsParser fixed in a distinct patch, and as a result these can't be merged; please do resubmit if other changes are useful, though :).\n. @emidln Thanks for the patch! :)\n. blinks. You're running out of memory trying to allocate 20 bytes? Could this be a system problem?\n. The relevant Composer bug thread is suggesting (1) it's an error with your Composer setup and (2) your PHP setup. Try fixing those and see what happens?\n. @parcolee did the PHP changes help?\n. Er. What? They're the same file. One is just stored \"raw\" - i.e., with the formatting in the file, rather than the formatting in the file subject to GitHub's frontend formatting.\n. They should contain exactly the same things. \"raw\", again, means, \"give me the file as it actually appears, not as it appears with GitHub's formatting\". They should contain exactly the same things. If you download the first file, and copy the content of the second page into a file, they should be identical files. There's no difference.\n. Well, the current regex shouldn't catch that; what's it providing for os/browser/etc?\n. \"passes all tests of javascript and python\"? I'm not a perl programmer so absent doing exactly what you did I'm not entirely sure what I can do there ;p. \nThe first user agent provided by percolee indeed produces Other/Android/Android, in python. The second one actually catches a device type. This is to unsurprising because the first agent isn't actually a browser - it's a component of Samsung's Android OS variant used to process audio and video files. They evidently haven't standardised the user agent there, as they have in a lot of other places.\n. For the second one see \"when broswer HTML5 audio player ( tag) load a forced download php file (output content-type audio/mpeg or audio/ogg), I caught from there.\nif just a simple text hyperlink ( tag) to the same forced download php url, it caught:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; zh-hk; SAMSUNG SM-N9005 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/1.5 Chrome/28.0.1500.94 Mobile Safari/537.36\"\nI mean literally, I read the YAML. The current regex looks for SAMSUNG in all caps for Samsung devices, because that's how Samsung have standardised theirs; evidently they didn't standardise for in-OS modules.\n. Okay. You say \"would\" - What does the first UA (SAMSUNG SM-N...) currently come out as?\n. No. I mean that you're saying \"X user agent would become Y breakdown\". Hypotheticals are nice but how does it currently come out?\n. Thanks!\n. @cxmcc Mind crunching it into a single commit?\n. @cxmcc thanks! And thanks for the patch :)\n. Can you describe the spider?\n. Good point! How odd. I've run some tests at my end and it seems to be catching the appropriate bots even when they're removed from being explicitly noted in the regex. Lemme make a patch...\n. @cjnoyes Merging is not possible; could you rebase and resubmit?\n. Hrm; build fail. Ideas?\n(Also, please compress into a single commit, if possible?)\n. Yeah; it looks like this test is causing the problem. Your regex is including the /1.0, whereas the existing device test isn't expecting it. Hrn. I guess the test was designed for this existing regex?\n. Uhm: https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml#L627-L628 - can you give an example string that isn't being caught?\n. Gotcha. cool! Thanks :)\n. Thanks!\n. The only recent update was this, and I can't see any changes to the range of syntax found in the file.\n. Also note that ua-parser is deprecated as a place to throw new changes.\n. Thanks! Sorry for such a long delay.\n. I did:\n device      os browser major_version minor_version\nOther Solaris   Other         Other         Other\nWhat exact functionality is broken?\n. @floydsoft what's passed?\n. If you mean \"the code works\": sure. But again, I'm not seeing, in the existing implementation, errors caused with the example string you've provided. What should be happening that isn't?\n. Okay; this makes it more clear ;p. So, in the future, you want a comment like \"In python 3.4, match detection breaks when...\"\n. Well, I'm also an analyst and I've submitted a lot; it's not particularly hard :). But I'll go through and take a look. I'm slightly confused by what you mean by \"detected as mobile\": the browser, as \"Mobile [browsername]\"? Or distinguishing desktop/mobile devices? Because ua-parser doesn't do the latter.\n. Looks like it to me! Want to write a patch?\nThanks for finding them!\n. Thanks!\n. A hard question! All \"other\" means is \"the user agent does not give enough information to identify a device\". This could mean:\n1. It's a desktop device, or;\n2. It's a mobile device that the regexes don't know about yet, or;\n3. It's a mobile device with a silly user agent.\nI'm not aware of any work that looks at the rate of each. But I'm currently working on a repository that matches ua-parser's \"device\" output to device_class, where that's tablet/phone/other. Something you might want to help out with/be notified about?\n. (Ignoring the unmatched parens, which I'll fix if people don't disapprove of the underlying idea)\n. Huh. And the test still fails, but I can't see /where/. Anyone got thoughts?\n. Hmn; define \"headless\" in this context? I'm trying to pick a commonsensical word. And yeah, we should separately have the travis output report more usefully; bah :/.\n. Hrm. Scrapy example needs fixing, but I can't for the life of me work out why libwww-perl/5.834 is triggering \"generic feature phone\" (the numeric values?)\n. Not directly mergeable; could you rebase and ideally crunch it into fewer commits?\n. Yeep.

Hi, \nwhat a coincidence, just saw the issue posted and where amazed that tv-set expose a unique UA.\nThanks for the message.\nI understood the meaning of device that way: The \"device\" is physical, so that means to me that I would buy a Sony or Panasonic TV but not a \"HbbTV\". I would see HbbTV as the UA but not as device. \nDoes that make sense to you?\n. As being \"consistently inconsistent\" this might break backwards compatibility in some of the cases anyhow. The case is that some of device.family contains already the \"brand\" but some do not. \nOne possibility is to introduce a \"brand_replacement\" in the \"device_parsers\" but that would mean that every parser needs to change the parsing logic. The approach within this branch tries to avoid this.\nI do not know, but in the later it might get more and more confusing for further contributors to consider then \"outdated\" backward compatibility values with good replacement values.\nTo avoid \"confusing\" values I would propose to write a small code which maintains the backwards compatibility for those affected.\nE.g. \nif (device.family === \"Apple iPad\") {\n    device.family = \"iPad\";\n}\nThe affected devices are currently \"Nokia Lumia\", \"Amazon Kindle\", \"Apple iP...\" and \"Samsung GT-\".\nIn the later it would be good to separate the values \"brand\" and \"model\" from \"family\" and build \"family\" by concatenation. But ihmo we need to introduce multiple replacements in the device_parsers first such to avoid an unnecessary explosion of additional regexes to determine \"brand\" and \"model\".\n. Last push on branch \"brand_model\" includes #271 and #281 merges now.\n. Please ignore proposal above. It would be too complicated to decide which type (new or old) of \"device.family\" to use.\nNow two keys \"brand\" and \"model\" have been introduced next to the existing \"family\". This is added to the device parser (currently only for JS).\n\"family\" can be obtained by concatenation of \"brand\" and \"model\" in most of the cases. The established value of \"family\" is left untouched like for iPhone,iPad,.. or Kindle. \n. de-noised now ... sorry\ntests for js and perl run. I will also push PR on HTTP-UA-Parser.\n. Thanks. I have left the device_replacement as is while introducing brand and model.\nI am currently reworking the whole device parsing by sorting in brand and model at the moment as I am interested to resolve the tons of unclassified android phones and tablets. So there will be a lot of new devices which haven't been detected so far. As some of the regex expressions do cause false positives I won't be able to avoid breaking backwards compatibility for some devices as this highly depends on the amount of user-agent strings available for tests. The current test suite is quite poor with only 400 strings. \nIn your opinion on which set of user-agent strings the backwards compat story shall be measured? \n. To progress with the backwards compat story I have added some tests to prove that the latest proposal is in fact backwards compatible. More tests will follow. Pls check the added file test_device_compatibility.csv. \nThe same results should be shown if these tests are run with the current regexes.yaml on master.\n. Sorry for pushing \"Close & Comment\" by accident. I am still with this PR :)\n. Do you need any further input before merge? I have made some progress which I would like to get accepted in other pull request(s) as there are quite some changes. You can have a look at them in my forks master branch.\nTobie Langel notifications@github.com schrieb:\n\nAny news?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/285#issuecomment-23676516\n.

Please find attached to the PR in doc/specification.md an initial draft of the ua-parser specification.\nI would be very glad to hear your comments.\n. Hi all,\nThanks for the progress and support.\nThe Spec now has its own PR #300 for discussion.\n\nContributing to the discussion Google or Asus for a Nexus 7:\n- Clearly \"Google\" is the \"brand\"\n- while \"Asus\" is the \"manufacturer\"\nSwitching from \"brand\" to \"manufacturer\" would let \"Asus\" make the deal. Right? \nFor my opinion even \"Asus\" is the brand as this is written on the back of the device together with \"nexus\" (do own this device).\nBut what to do with Operator specific devices which are manufactured by someone which is unknown.\nE.g. \"Vodafone 845\". This is from a Chinese manufacturer which is difficult to find.\nTherefore I would like to stick with \"brand\" in order to be able to solve those cases.\n. php parser now uses brand model parsing as well.\n. Kindle Fire HDX support from PR #303 added and extended\n. @lstrojny: Hi Lars, tanks for your review.\n. Hi @nielsbasjes, Thanks for making the efforts for brand_model. I would suggest to remove the UAs with the \"nasty\" characters, as fixing yaml parsing is ooS of this prj. \nI will update the test_device.yaml file accordingly.\n. The current state of supported Parsers for this PR is:\n| Impl | Support | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| C#: | Not supported yet | Support promised as of #305 |\n| D: | Not supported yet | No feedback so far |\n| Go: | Not supported yet | Support promised after spec is stable |\n| Haskell: | Not supported yet | No feedback so far |\n| Java: | Supported | PR #320 |\n| JavaScript: | Supported |  |\n| Perl: | Supported |  |\n| PHP: | Supported | Refactored meanwhile |\n| Pig: | Supported | PR #320 |\n| Python: | Supported |  |\n| Ruby: | Not supported yet | Own Repo - support stated |\n| C++: | Not supported yet | Upcoming PR #312 - no support stated |\nDo we think the spec is stable?? There are not much comments on #300. Could be a good sign that everyone is happy with it - correct?\nThen what about #304 on reorganizing the project. The last post is a month old.\nI would prefer a pragmatic solution with respect to the not yet supported 6 parsers soon.\nIf possible I would like to aim for only one more rebasing session for this PR before any possible merge - regexes and php parser have evolved quite a lot on master branch.\nThese sort of Zen exercises require quite some concentration ...\n. @toolmantim Great to have you on board. Thanks.\n. To overcome the situation of a development deadlock from unsupported parsers (at least from my point-of-view) I suggest the following: \n- Freeze the current regexes.yaml on todays master branch and copy it to regexes_outdated.yaml\n- Unsupported parser point now to regexes_outdated.yaml as of this PR\n- A note is given in the README to highlight the situation.\n- Continue evolving the present regexes.yaml with the updated device parser.\nThis PR is updated with respect to the proposed.\n. Won't we hide some information by just saying Windows 8 === Windows 8.1. \nI recon that Windows matchers do not use the major version info at present. But shouldn't we use it here now?\nSo my proposal would be to add the version info to 6.2 but change the scheme for 8.1.\n```\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6.2; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6.2)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows 8'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n\nregex: '(Windows NT 6.3; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n    os_v2_replacement: '1'\nregex: '(Windows NT 6.3)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n    os_v2_replacement: '1'\n```\n. It seams that Windows 8.1 is the official release name. I suppose that \"Windows 8.1\" is the desired OS name then.\nSo it would be good to update this:\n\n- regex: '(Windows NT 6\\.2; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT'\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6\\.3; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT 8.1'\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6\\.3)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows 8.1'\nThis would be some sort of inconsistent for Windows RT as 6.3 would contain 8.1 but 6.2 would not.\nOn not knowing the future release strategy of Microsoft opposed to my previous suggestion major any minor version would not be used here. Right?\n. Is the Xbox IE so different to the Desktop IE? If this is the case the device parser would also give the information on the device, so using ua.family + device.family would lead to the same.\nI would prefer not to add this type of info: \".. for ..\". \n. Current version correctly identifies above UA\n{\n \"string\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)\",\n \"ua\": {\n  \"family\": \"bingbot\",\n  \"major\": \"2\",\n  \"minor\": \"0\",\n  \"patch\": null\n },\n \"os\": {\n  \"family\": \"Other\",\n  \"major\": null,\n  \"minor\": null,\n  \"patch\": null,\n  \"patchMinor\": null\n },\n \"device\": {\n  \"family\": \"Spider\"\n },\n}\n. Support for IE 11 has been added on 2013-07-23. The User-Agents linked above get \"IE 11.0\".\nIf you get something different, please post your User-Agent-Strings.\n. python tests fail due to whitespaces. I will fix that. \n. This PR has the following goals:\n- Ease adding testcases for the different parsers.\n- Ease adaptation of regular expressions in the regexes.yaml file.\n- Generate visibility of changes to the regexes.yaml file for a contributor\n- Generate visibility of bad user-agent matches for a contributor such allowing him to change the regexes.yaml file as well as changing the testcases accordingly.\n. I just came across the js_ua attribute within test_user_agent_parser.yaml which broke the python tests.\nThis is some extra info which is only part of the python parser (See lines 236ff).\nCurrently these tests are excluded in with_fixtures.js tests in line 22 from the js parser as well as in the other langs (java, go, perl, php).\nApart from that the functionality is obsolete as the js_ua info provided in the testcases needs to come from somewhere.\nIMHO if this information provided by js_ua is relevant, then it should be in the regexes.yaml file but not in the parser itself. \nThis could be achieved either by using chromeframe as ua.family and not having any additional info or implementing the multireplace mechanism as with the device parser.\nFor the moment I commented out js_ua in test_user_agent_parser.\nWhat do you think?\n. @tobie: Did you give it a try?\n. I moved the PR to a new project ua-parser-tools.\nTherefore I will close this PR.\n. PR rebased\n. Commit \"improved Generic Smartphone parsing\" tackles #208 \n. I will do the splitting into brand and model and rebase this PR into PR #285, no problem.\nCan we merge then?\n. But why should a \"slow\" PR inhibit merging a small one like this into master?\n. Basically we have the following dependencies within this project\n1. regexes.yaml which implements the rules,\n2. based on a spec a (core-)parser can implement and parse those rules,\n3. which are verified by a large (or smaller) testset.\nSo if the regexes.yaml evolves (that's what we want as number of User-Agents is constantly growing)\nnormally only the \"rules\" change, but not the parser. \nIn this \"normal\" case, testcases need to support the \"rules\". The different parser implementations remain as they are.\nIn the \"special\" case that \"rules\" also require different logic within the parser, the version of the regexes.yaml (core-)parser as well as the associated testcases shall evolve.\nContributors are free to \"backport\" rules from an upcoming version as long as these are compatible with the logic of the respective parser until its implementation gets updated to the new logic.\nTherefore I support the idea of ozataman to keep the different versions of the regexes.yaml files within the repository. This allows to symlink the respective yaml file version with its corresponding testset to the dedicated parser.\nEach parser maintainer is then able to always include the correct regexes version.\nWith respect to the testset, I would propose to maintain a raw file of user-agent strings which can be used by contributors to add rules and extend the testset(s). From my proper experience it is often difficult to find good markers for good rules from small sets, if the possible set of input variables (here user-agents) is not available.\nFinally I would recommend to rethink using yaml files for the testsets as for large testsets on some langs the time to parse the yaml testsets increases massively. Here I would recommend using JSON instead.\n. Hi all,\nPlease find below a proposal for a possible reorganized tree structure.\nThe idea is to use semver dirs for the different \"rules\"-versions.\nThis includes the specification as well as the testcases.\nEach parser links to the correct version of the rules it implements.\nContributors can contribute for the different versions of the regexes.yaml using development tools to add testcases.\nI would propose to try to provide support for two major/minor versions at all to allow parsers to upgrade.\nIf all parsers are upgraded, the lower version of the \"rules\" could be discontinued by removing it from the project.\n.\n\u2502   (PARSERS)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 csharp  --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 d       --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 go      --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 haskell --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 java    --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 js      --uses--> ../regexes/2/1/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 perl    --uses--> ../regexes/2/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 php     --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pig     --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 py      --uses--> ../regexes/2/1/regexes.yaml\n\u2502\n\u2502   (TOOLS)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tools (PR#301)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1 (major)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 0 (minor)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 (implements core parser v1.0)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 (implements core parser v2.0)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 (implements core parser v2.1)\n\u2502\n\u2502   (RULES)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 latest --> ../2/0\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 0   {== current version}\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes.yaml\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_resources\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0          \u251c\u2500\u2500 ua/os/device tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0          \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2   \n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0   {== upcoming version brand_model (PR#285)} \n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 spec.md (PR#300)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes.yaml\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_resources\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 ua/os/device tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502        \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 1   {== e.g. regex_flag (PR#302)}\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 spec.md\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes.yaml\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_resources\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0          \u251c\u2500\u2500 ua/os/device tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0          \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser tests\nIf someone wants to link to the current regexes.yaml file he/she can use the symlinked version regexes/latest/regexes.yaml or the link using https://raw.github.com/tobie/ua-parser/master/regexes/latest/regexes.yaml\nWhat do you think? \n. Convinced. Lets go for tagging and submodules then. \n. Hi Vitaly, I'm working on a project called ua-parser-caps. This tries to add the capabilities you proposed to ua-parser. Support is appreciated.\n. Can I help here with \"time\"? Would be mine of course :)\n. Possible values are documented in the testcases. Please have a look into the different yaml files under test_resources.\n. @lstrojny cool contrib\nMay you be able to support me with my PR #285? It introduces a new replacer which you can find in js/lib/device.js (multiReplace). The method is additionally described in #300.\nI would be very happy if you could make it.\n. Thanks for your notice. As having some time I had a look on your code and started to implement my required changes. I succeeded in less that I really expected. You can find the changes on my forked master branch. \nAs soon as your changes get accepted I will put a PR on that.\nThen I would be glad if you could make a code review on my changes.\n. There is a discussion on this within PR #292.\n. Should be solved with PR #363.\n. Having tried several things to add device capabilities to ua-parser, I ended up to build ua-parser-caps on top of it.\nThe main reason for doing this is to keep things separate, on one side the real parsing of an user-agent and on the other hand the things we read out of it, means the capabilities we like to apply.\nOtherwise we would end up in a \"can of worms\" as already discussed within Issue #75 .\nBased on the brand-model parsing I have started to classify device-type and user-view of a user-agent.\nI would be very glad to hear you comments on that topic, your review and of course hoping in getting now the necessary support of getting the brand-model parsing agreed and merged into this project.\n. Option 4: Looks like the proposal of #241 would be an ideal candidate. Right?\nIn this case the multiReplace function (introduced with brand_model for parseDevice) could be reused within the parseUA to add a matcher for the \"engine_replacement\".\n. @tobie can you please increment current master branch with npm version minor and publish with npm publish from commandline?\n. Testcases to support a PR would be appreciated.\n. I would see this differentiation in the device parser rather than in the ua parser. \nIn the depicted case is Firefox Mobile the browser engine running on a Tablet. As no further information on the device is presented it would be a Generic Tablet then.\nWith the os parser change to detect Firefox OS I am fine.\n. +1\n. Unfortunately the device parsing is still far from perfect.\nI have made quite some efforts on adding device parsing but this relies completely on the brand_model parser which is currently on hold until the project is being reorganized.\nPlease take a look at https://github.com/commenthol/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml#L3041 for the Samsung Android Rules. Your UA is detected fine there.\nAnd this https://github.com/commenthol/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml#L3859 should fix things for the youtube UAs.\n. The proposed change makes sense to me. It is in fact a Webkit browser (Mobile Safari) using the defined Build Version. Albeight the manufacturers often change quite a lot for their specific build on this \"legacy\" browser. It is important to note that the rule shall not hide a more specific browser as is e.g. Mobile Chrome. \nThe Android Version is already covered in the OS parser.\n. After doing some research:\n- Not all UAs contain the Version/ info but all contain the technical version Safari/\n- Would opt for a matcher like that\n- regex: 'Android.*(Safari)/(\\d{3})\\.(\\d+)'\n    family_replacement: 'Mobile Safari'\n. Yep. That is the so called Desktop view. You can configure this in the browser.\n. This is right for the device but not for the User-Agent. There is often a correlation between device and User-Agent as the User-Agent (aka Browser) relies on Hardware features which can be implemented right or buggy.\nFor details on the User-Agent on Android see here.\nhttps://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/user-agent\nIn fact this is a description for Chrome Mobile but the same applies to the legacy Webkit User-Agents as well.\n. On looking just on the User-Agent String it is not possible to distinguish the different Apple models. If you really want to know the model (e.g. 3,4,5) I'll recommend using a javascript which detects the different screen sizes. But even with that you won't be able to detect the iPhone 5C in blue.\n. There is a specification on https://github.com/commenthol/ua-parser/commit/show/6cf3a301eb82971a2822506e19ac6d73d49ba97a/76c8365#diff-76c8365f9a422dc5c687b3f1a25d2a7d which should give you the necessary details for understanding the yaml file.\n. Thanks for your efforts on uap-core. Will send you a PR with the spec now.\n. rebased for merge after #361 \n. For the \"Opera Mini\" without \"/att\" tests do exist.\n.

Problem with travis is solved now. :)\n. Wow that was fast... Thanks.\n. @toolmantim just want to leave you a note, that the brand-model parsing has been merged. It would be awesome if you'd update your project to support the new regexes. \n. Let me say it this way:\n(Iceweasel == Firefox) === true\n(Iceweasel === Firefox) === false\nApart from being the same, yes there is a difference.\nIMHO there is an interest for people to get knowledge of exactly that difference. (Imagine Stats).\n@Mte90 If I understood you right you are trying to identify an \"engine\" or at least capabilities of a browser. Those would be the same.\nUnlike we do not yet take care of such, I would consider Iceweasel as being different to Firefox.\n. My primary intention of #466 is to show the current state of the brand-model parsing which has been introduced with #285 in Aug. 2013.\nWith this I like to renew the discussion on #304 and like to encourage this project to give guidelines on how and where to drive itself.\nSo I'm currently not disappointed by PR #466 being reverted, but I definitely would be, if no further action than that is the outcome.\nFor me the following steps need to be next:\n1. Really kick-off the seperation of parsers to yaml rules as intended by #304 and started with ua-parser.\n   - Prepare the parser base-projects to allow PRs from active members \n   - Milestones and/or Timelines could be a good starting point...\n     - Step1: Migrate the present\n     - Step2: Adding new features\n2. Consider correct versioning as must-have\n   - ua-parser on npm is in a terrible state #323\n   - Is releasing Java SNAPSHOTS only the right release model?\n3. Truely state what shall be in and what shall be out-of-scope of ua-parser.\n   - E.g. Is Brand-Model Parsing as proposed in #466 really desired?\n   - Does generalization of parser sematics (multi-replacements, case-insensitive matches as of brand-model parsing) make sense for user_agent_parsers: and os_parsers: rules as well?\n   - Can we finalize the first draft version of the spec? #300\n   - Are annotating parsing results desired? E.g. does this project want to have details of a device \"mobile/tablet/desktop\" as proposed in #428 or doesn't it as stated in #75?\n   - Do we want to get seperate parser-rules for browser engines as proposed by #241?\n   - Order of priority: Is performance more important than the detailed detection of a UA?\n     Is working on performance, which inevitable involves a change of parser semantics, a project goal?\nCan I please get commitments/feedback/answers for this? \n. This project has moved to https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core. \nPlease use the regexes.yaml file from there. \nWindows 10 is already supported.\n. We have moved to uap-core. Can you please update the regexes with proper testcases there? Thanks.\n. @public can you please commit your changes to https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-python as this project has moved.\n. Please consider that this project has moved to ua-parser. \nI think the problem arises from mixing a regexes.yaml file with an unsupported parser version.\n. Hi, this repo has moved to https://github.com/ua-parser/. Please check for the latest version there. Thanks.\n. This project has moved. Please try with the latest release from ua-parser/uap-core and if still present report this issue there. \n. @MaxVerro please note that this project has moved. Pls check README. Please submit a PR there.\n. Please note that project has moved. Check Readme.. Please note that project has moved. Check Readme.. I searched all my ua-strings and have only found UP.Browser user-agents using the scheme discussed using 6.2_7.2.7\nWhat is interesting to note is, that 2_7.2.7 is a repeated 2.7. \nI suppose the right version intended is 6.2.7 as before and after (next is 6.3.0) all version info is using [0-9].[0-9].[0-9].\nShortened list of segmented UA-s:\nUP.Browser/6.2.3.9.j.1.107-20081119\nUP.Browser/6.2_7.2.7.1.K.1.5.1.108\n...\nUP.Browser/6.2_7.2.7.1.K.7.113\nUP.Browser/6.3.0\n. From my point of view the Generic Smartphone rule should be changed to\n- regex: '(Symbian|\\bS60\\b|Windows CE|Opera Mobi|BREW|Brew|Mobile; .+Firefox/|iPhone OS|Android|MobileSafari|^N97-[14]|(webOS/|PalmOS)'\n  device_replacement: 'Generic Smartphone'\n  brand_replacement: 'Generic'\n  model_replacement: 'Smartphone'\n  - regex: '(hiptop|avantgo|plucker|xiino|blazer|elaine)'\n    regex_flag: 'i'\n    device_replacement: 'Generic Smartphone'\n    brand_replacement: 'Generic'\n    model_replacement: 'Smartphone'\nThis will solve the issue. I can update PR #302 accordingly to solve this.\n. Detection if IE11 and Windows 8.1 is already solved, The netvibes bot with tests is missing yet.\nA User-Agent for tests could be\nNetvibes (http://www.netvibes.com)\n. All should be solved now...\n. Is there any need to distinguish between 32 and 64bit versions? \nIf so we would need to adapt Windows NT 6,7 versions as well. WOW64 could be used as marker.\nWhat about *Unixes Linux x86_64, Mac OSX?\n. Can't you do this \"grouping\" of Os-es outside the scope of ua-parser?\nMeans, use some program which combines your required info from os.family.\nBy the way, isn't that grouping already present? Well not for Windows due to Microsofts special versioning, but for the others?\n. PR obsolete as included in #285\n. Hi, \nwhat a coincidence, just saw the issue posted and where amazed that tv-set expose a unique UA.\nThanks for the message.\nI understood the meaning of device that way: The \"device\" is physical, so that means to me that I would buy a Sony or Panasonic TV but not a \"HbbTV\". I would see HbbTV as the UA but not as device. \nDoes that make sense to you?\n. As being \"consistently inconsistent\" this might break backwards compatibility in some of the cases anyhow. The case is that some of device.family contains already the \"brand\" but some do not. \nOne possibility is to introduce a \"brand_replacement\" in the \"device_parsers\" but that would mean that every parser needs to change the parsing logic. The approach within this branch tries to avoid this.\nI do not know, but in the later it might get more and more confusing for further contributors to consider then \"outdated\" backward compatibility values with good replacement values.\nTo avoid \"confusing\" values I would propose to write a small code which maintains the backwards compatibility for those affected.\nE.g. \nif (device.family === \"Apple iPad\") {\n    device.family = \"iPad\";\n}\nThe affected devices are currently \"Nokia Lumia\", \"Amazon Kindle\", \"Apple iP...\" and \"Samsung GT-\".\nIn the later it would be good to separate the values \"brand\" and \"model\" from \"family\" and build \"family\" by concatenation. But ihmo we need to introduce multiple replacements in the device_parsers first such to avoid an unnecessary explosion of additional regexes to determine \"brand\" and \"model\".\n. Last push on branch \"brand_model\" includes #271 and #281 merges now.\n. Please ignore proposal above. It would be too complicated to decide which type (new or old) of \"device.family\" to use.\nNow two keys \"brand\" and \"model\" have been introduced next to the existing \"family\". This is added to the device parser (currently only for JS).\n\"family\" can be obtained by concatenation of \"brand\" and \"model\" in most of the cases. The established value of \"family\" is left untouched like for iPhone,iPad,.. or Kindle. \n. de-noised now ... sorry\ntests for js and perl run. I will also push PR on HTTP-UA-Parser.\n. Thanks. I have left the device_replacement as is while introducing brand and model.\nI am currently reworking the whole device parsing by sorting in brand and model at the moment as I am interested to resolve the tons of unclassified android phones and tablets. So there will be a lot of new devices which haven't been detected so far. As some of the regex expressions do cause false positives I won't be able to avoid breaking backwards compatibility for some devices as this highly depends on the amount of user-agent strings available for tests. The current test suite is quite poor with only 400 strings. \nIn your opinion on which set of user-agent strings the backwards compat story shall be measured? \n. To progress with the backwards compat story I have added some tests to prove that the latest proposal is in fact backwards compatible. More tests will follow. Pls check the added file test_device_compatibility.csv. \nThe same results should be shown if these tests are run with the current regexes.yaml on master.\n. Sorry for pushing \"Close & Comment\" by accident. I am still with this PR :)\n. Do you need any further input before merge? I have made some progress which I would like to get accepted in other pull request(s) as there are quite some changes.

I think I will not be able to dig into haskell or pig...\n. Got started.. Please find attached to the PR in doc/specification.md an initial draft of the ua-parser specification.\nI would be very glad to hear your comments.\n. Hi all,\nThanks for the progress and support.\nThe Spec now has its own PR #300 for discussion.\n\nContributing to the discussion Google or Asus for a Nexus 7:\n- Clearly \"Google\" is the \"brand\"\n- while \"Asus\" is the \"manufacturer\"\nSwitching from \"brand\" to \"manufacturer\" would let \"Asus\" make the deal. Right? \nFor my opinion even \"Asus\" is the brand as this is written on the back of the device together with \"nexus\" (do own this device).\nBut what to do with Operator specific devices which are manufactured by someone which is unknown.\nE.g. \"Vodafone 845\". This is from a Chinese manufacturer which is difficult to find.\nTherefore I would like to stick with \"brand\" in order to be able to solve those cases.\n. php parser now uses brand model parsing as well.\n. Kindle Fire HDX support from PR #303 added and extended\n. @lstrojny: Hi Lars, tanks for your review.\n. Hi @nielsbasjes, Thanks for making the efforts for brand_model. I would suggest to remove the UAs with the \"nasty\" characters, as fixing yaml parsing is ooS of this prj. \nI will update the test_device.yaml file accordingly.\n. The current state of supported Parsers for this PR is:\n| Impl | Support | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| C#: | Not supported yet | Support promised as of #305 |\n| D: | Not supported yet | No feedback so far |\n| Go: | Not supported yet | Support promised after spec is stable |\n| Haskell: | Not supported yet | No feedback so far |\n| Java: | Supported | PR #320 |\n| JavaScript: | Supported |  |\n| Perl: | Supported |  |\n| PHP: | Supported | Refactored meanwhile |\n| Pig: | Supported | PR #320 |\n| Python: | Supported |  |\n| Ruby: | Not supported yet | Own Repo - support stated |\n| C++: | Not supported yet | Upcoming PR #312 - no support stated |\nDo we think the spec is stable?? There are not much comments on #300. Could be a good sign that everyone is happy with it - correct?\nThen what about #304 on reorganizing the project. The last post is a month old.\nI would prefer a pragmatic solution with respect to the not yet supported 6 parsers soon.\nIf possible I would like to aim for only one more rebasing session for this PR before any possible merge - regexes and php parser have evolved quite a lot on master branch.\nThese sort of Zen exercises require quite some concentration ...\n. @toolmantim Great to have you on board. Thanks.\n. To overcome the situation of a development deadlock from unsupported parsers (at least from my point-of-view) I suggest the following: \n- Freeze the current regexes.yaml on todays master branch and copy it to regexes_outdated.yaml\n- Unsupported parser point now to regexes_outdated.yaml as of this PR\n- A note is given in the README to highlight the situation.\n- Continue evolving the present regexes.yaml with the updated device parser.\nThis PR is updated with respect to the proposed.\n. Won't we hide some information by just saying Windows 8 === Windows 8.1. \nI recon that Windows matchers do not use the major version info at present. But shouldn't we use it here now?\nSo my proposal would be to add the version info to 6.2 but change the scheme for 8.1.\n```\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6.2; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6.2)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows 8'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n\nregex: '(Windows NT 6.3; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n    os_v2_replacement: '1'\nregex: '(Windows NT 6.3)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows'\n    os_v1_replacement: '8'\n    os_v2_replacement: '1'\n```\n. It seams that Windows 8.1 is the official release name. I suppose that \"Windows 8.1\" is the desired OS name then.\nSo it would be good to update this:\n\n- regex: '(Windows NT 6\\.2; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT'\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6\\.3; ARM;)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows RT 8.1'\n  - regex: '(Windows NT 6\\.3)'\n    os_replacement: 'Windows 8.1'\nThis would be some sort of inconsistent for Windows RT as 6.3 would contain 8.1 but 6.2 would not.\nOn not knowing the future release strategy of Microsoft opposed to my previous suggestion major any minor version would not be used here. Right?\n. Is the Xbox IE so different to the Desktop IE? If this is the case the device parser would also give the information on the device, so using ua.family + device.family would lead to the same.\nI would prefer not to add this type of info: \".. for ..\". \n. Current version correctly identifies above UA\n{\n \"string\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)\",\n \"ua\": {\n  \"family\": \"bingbot\",\n  \"major\": \"2\",\n  \"minor\": \"0\",\n  \"patch\": null\n },\n \"os\": {\n  \"family\": \"Other\",\n  \"major\": null,\n  \"minor\": null,\n  \"patch\": null,\n  \"patchMinor\": null\n },\n \"device\": {\n  \"family\": \"Spider\"\n },\n}\n. Support for IE 11 has been added on 2013-07-23. The User-Agents linked above get \"IE 11.0\".\nIf you get something different, please post your User-Agent-Strings.\n. python tests fail due to whitespaces. I will fix that. \n. This PR has the following goals:\n- Ease adding testcases for the different parsers.\n- Ease adaptation of regular expressions in the regexes.yaml file.\n- Generate visibility of changes to the regexes.yaml file for a contributor\n- Generate visibility of bad user-agent matches for a contributor such allowing him to change the regexes.yaml file as well as changing the testcases accordingly.\n. I just came across the js_ua attribute within test_user_agent_parser.yaml which broke the python tests.\nThis is some extra info which is only part of the python parser (See lines 236ff).\nCurrently these tests are excluded in with_fixtures.js tests in line 22 from the js parser as well as in the other langs (java, go, perl, php).\nApart from that the functionality is obsolete as the js_ua info provided in the testcases needs to come from somewhere.\nIMHO if this information provided by js_ua is relevant, then it should be in the regexes.yaml file but not in the parser itself. \nThis could be achieved either by using chromeframe as ua.family and not having any additional info or implementing the multireplace mechanism as with the device parser.\nFor the moment I commented out js_ua in test_user_agent_parser.\nWhat do you think?\n. @tobie: Did you give it a try?\n. I moved the PR to a new project ua-parser-tools.\nTherefore I will close this PR.\n. PR rebased\n. Commit \"improved Generic Smartphone parsing\" tackles #208 \n. I will do the splitting into brand and model and rebase this PR into PR #285, no problem.\nCan we merge then?\n. But why should a \"slow\" PR inhibit merging a small one like this into master?\n. Basically we have the following dependencies within this project\n1. regexes.yaml which implements the rules,\n2. based on a spec a (core-)parser can implement and parse those rules,\n3. which are verified by a large (or smaller) testset.\nSo if the regexes.yaml evolves (that's what we want as number of User-Agents is constantly growing)\nnormally only the \"rules\" change, but not the parser. \nIn this \"normal\" case, testcases need to support the \"rules\". The different parser implementations remain as they are.\nIn the \"special\" case that \"rules\" also require different logic within the parser, the version of the regexes.yaml (core-)parser as well as the associated testcases shall evolve.\nContributors are free to \"backport\" rules from an upcoming version as long as these are compatible with the logic of the respective parser until its implementation gets updated to the new logic.\nTherefore I support the idea of ozataman to keep the different versions of the regexes.yaml files within the repository. This allows to symlink the respective yaml file version with its corresponding testset to the dedicated parser.\nEach parser maintainer is then able to always include the correct regexes version.\nWith respect to the testset, I would propose to maintain a raw file of user-agent strings which can be used by contributors to add rules and extend the testset(s). From my proper experience it is often difficult to find good markers for good rules from small sets, if the possible set of input variables (here user-agents) is not available.\nFinally I would recommend to rethink using yaml files for the testsets as for large testsets on some langs the time to parse the yaml testsets increases massively. Here I would recommend using JSON instead.\n. Hi all,\nPlease find below a proposal for a possible reorganized tree structure.\nThe idea is to use semver dirs for the different \"rules\"-versions.\nThis includes the specification as well as the testcases.\nEach parser links to the correct version of the rules it implements.\nContributors can contribute for the different versions of the regexes.yaml using development tools to add testcases.\nI would propose to try to provide support for two major/minor versions at all to allow parsers to upgrade.\nIf all parsers are upgraded, the lower version of the \"rules\" could be discontinued by removing it from the project.\n.\n\u2502   (PARSERS)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 csharp  --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 d       --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 go      --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 haskell --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 java    --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 js      --uses--> ../regexes/2/1/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 perl    --uses--> ../regexes/2/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 php     --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pig     --uses--> ../regexes/1/0/regexes.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 py      --uses--> ../regexes/2/1/regexes.yaml\n\u2502\n\u2502   (TOOLS)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tools (PR#301)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1 (major)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 0 (minor)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 (implements core parser v1.0)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 (implements core parser v2.0)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 (implements core parser v2.1)\n\u2502\n\u2502   (RULES)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 latest --> ../2/0\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 0   {== current version}\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes.yaml\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_resources\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0          \u251c\u2500\u2500 ua/os/device tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0          \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2   \n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0   {== upcoming version brand_model (PR#285)} \n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 spec.md (PR#300)\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes.yaml\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_resources\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 ua/os/device tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502        \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 1   {== e.g. regex_flag (PR#302)}\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 spec.md\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 regexes.yaml\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_resources\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0          \u251c\u2500\u2500 ua/os/device tests\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0          \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser tests\nIf someone wants to link to the current regexes.yaml file he/she can use the symlinked version regexes/latest/regexes.yaml or the link using https://raw.github.com/tobie/ua-parser/master/regexes/latest/regexes.yaml\nWhat do you think? \n. Convinced. Lets go for tagging and submodules then. \n. Hi Vitaly, I'm working on a project called ua-parser-caps. This tries to add the capabilities you proposed to ua-parser. Support is appreciated.\n. Can I help here with \"time\"? Would be mine of course :)\n. Possible values are documented in the testcases. Please have a look into the different yaml files under test_resources.\n. @lstrojny cool contrib\nMay you be able to support me with my PR #285? It introduces a new replacer which you can find in js/lib/device.js (multiReplace). The method is additionally described in #300.\nI would be very happy if you could make it.\n. Thanks for your notice. As having some time I had a look on your code and started to implement my required changes. I succeeded in less that I really expected. You can find the changes on my forked master branch. \nAs soon as your changes get accepted I will put a PR on that.\nThen I would be glad if you could make a code review on my changes.\n. There is a discussion on this within PR #292.\n. Should be solved with PR #363.\n. Having tried several things to add device capabilities to ua-parser, I ended up to build ua-parser-caps on top of it.\nThe main reason for doing this is to keep things separate, on one side the real parsing of an user-agent and on the other hand the things we read out of it, means the capabilities we like to apply.\nOtherwise we would end up in a \"can of worms\" as already discussed within Issue #75 .\nBased on the brand-model parsing I have started to classify device-type and user-view of a user-agent.\nI would be very glad to hear you comments on that topic, your review and of course hoping in getting now the necessary support of getting the brand-model parsing agreed and merged into this project.\n. Option 4: Looks like the proposal of #241 would be an ideal candidate. Right?\nIn this case the multiReplace function (introduced with brand_model for parseDevice) could be reused within the parseUA to add a matcher for the \"engine_replacement\".\n. @tobie can you please increment current master branch with npm version minor and publish with npm publish from commandline?\n. Testcases to support a PR would be appreciated.\n. I would see this differentiation in the device parser rather than in the ua parser. \nIn the depicted case is Firefox Mobile the browser engine running on a Tablet. As no further information on the device is presented it would be a Generic Tablet then.\nWith the os parser change to detect Firefox OS I am fine.\n. +1\n. Unfortunately the device parsing is still far from perfect.\nI have made quite some efforts on adding device parsing but this relies completely on the brand_model parser which is currently on hold until the project is being reorganized.\nPlease take a look at https://github.com/commenthol/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml#L3041 for the Samsung Android Rules. Your UA is detected fine there.\nAnd this https://github.com/commenthol/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml#L3859 should fix things for the youtube UAs.\n. The proposed change makes sense to me. It is in fact a Webkit browser (Mobile Safari) using the defined Build Version. Albeight the manufacturers often change quite a lot for their specific build on this \"legacy\" browser. It is important to note that the rule shall not hide a more specific browser as is e.g. Mobile Chrome. \nThe Android Version is already covered in the OS parser.\n. After doing some research:\n- Not all UAs contain the Version/ info but all contain the technical version Safari/\n- Would opt for a matcher like that\n- regex: 'Android.*(Safari)/(\\d{3})\\.(\\d+)'\n    family_replacement: 'Mobile Safari'\n. Yep. That is the so called Desktop view. You can configure this in the browser.\n. This is right for the device but not for the User-Agent. There is often a correlation between device and User-Agent as the User-Agent (aka Browser) relies on Hardware features which can be implemented right or buggy.\nFor details on the User-Agent on Android see here.\nhttps://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/user-agent\nIn fact this is a description for Chrome Mobile but the same applies to the legacy Webkit User-Agents as well.\n. On looking just on the User-Agent String it is not possible to distinguish the different Apple models. If you really want to know the model (e.g. 3,4,5) I'll recommend using a javascript which detects the different screen sizes. But even with that you won't be able to detect the iPhone 5C in blue.\n. There is a specification on https://github.com/commenthol/ua-parser/commit/show/6cf3a301eb82971a2822506e19ac6d73d49ba97a/76c8365#diff-76c8365f9a422dc5c687b3f1a25d2a7d which should give you the necessary details for understanding the yaml file.\n. Thanks for your efforts on uap-core. Will send you a PR with the spec now.\n. rebased for merge after #361 \n. For the \"Opera Mini\" without \"/att\" tests do exist.\n.

Problem with travis is solved now. :)\n. Wow that was fast... Thanks.\n. @toolmantim just want to leave you a note, that the brand-model parsing has been merged. It would be awesome if you'd update your project to support the new regexes. \n. Let me say it this way:\n(Iceweasel == Firefox) === true\n(Iceweasel === Firefox) === false\nApart from being the same, yes there is a difference.\nIMHO there is an interest for people to get knowledge of exactly that difference. (Imagine Stats).\n@Mte90 If I understood you right you are trying to identify an \"engine\" or at least capabilities of a browser. Those would be the same.\nUnlike we do not yet take care of such, I would consider Iceweasel as being different to Firefox.\n. My primary intention of #466 is to show the current state of the brand-model parsing which has been introduced with #285 in Aug. 2013.\nWith this I like to renew the discussion on #304 and like to encourage this project to give guidelines on how and where to drive itself.\nSo I'm currently not disappointed by PR #466 being reverted, but I definitely would be, if no further action than that is the outcome.\nFor me the following steps need to be next:\n1. Really kick-off the seperation of parsers to yaml rules as intended by #304 and started with ua-parser.\n   - Prepare the parser base-projects to allow PRs from active members \n   - Milestones and/or Timelines could be a good starting point...\n     - Step1: Migrate the present\n     - Step2: Adding new features\n2. Consider correct versioning as must-have\n   - ua-parser on npm is in a terrible state #323\n   - Is releasing Java SNAPSHOTS only the right release model?\n3. Truely state what shall be in and what shall be out-of-scope of ua-parser.\n   - E.g. Is Brand-Model Parsing as proposed in #466 really desired?\n   - Does generalization of parser sematics (multi-replacements, case-insensitive matches as of brand-model parsing) make sense for user_agent_parsers: and os_parsers: rules as well?\n   - Can we finalize the first draft version of the spec? #300\n   - Are annotating parsing results desired? E.g. does this project want to have details of a device \"mobile/tablet/desktop\" as proposed in #428 or doesn't it as stated in #75?\n   - Do we want to get seperate parser-rules for browser engines as proposed by #241?\n   - Order of priority: Is performance more important than the detailed detection of a UA?\n     Is working on performance, which inevitable involves a change of parser semantics, a project goal?\nCan I please get commitments/feedback/answers for this? \n. This project has moved to https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core. \nPlease use the regexes.yaml file from there. \nWindows 10 is already supported.\n. We have moved to uap-core. Can you please update the regexes with proper testcases there? Thanks.\n. @public can you please commit your changes to https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-python as this project has moved.\n.

If\nnot, I can try to copy it down before the install happens, but it'd be\neasier, and the setup.py would be cleaner, if we could just symlink it.\nOn Fri, Mar 15, 2013 at 9:46 AM, Selwin Ong notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n@rascalking https://github.com/rascalking no reason other than\nignorance :). Alright, let me know how it goes. Thanks!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/issues/209#issuecomment-14961227\n.\n\n\ndavid bonner // dbonner@gmail.com\n. Managed to avoid needing a symlink, and I think I've got a fix.  Can somebody with an ubuntu vm try to install my patch via \"pip install git+git://github.com/rascalking/ua-parser.git@py-install-refactor#egg=ua-parser\", and let me know if that works there?\n. PR is #217.\n. Hell.  I'm guessing that when installing this way, ua-parser's setup.py is being run from outside its directory.  If that's the case, a fix I just pushed on a branch should solve the issue.  I've verified that it continues to work for me with the test cases I can run (manyal setup.py, pip install .).\n@georgevreilly, any chance you can try out https://github.com/rascalking/ua-parser/tree/py-setup-fix-again on your private pypi server to see if it fixes the issue for you?\n. @malicustommade, it is a dependency...the issue we're trying to solve here is that due to different ways to install the package, it's tricky to get the data file we need (the regexes.yaml file).\n. Sending a more complete fix in a few.\n. ",

I think you need to do something withregexes.yamlin thebuild_pycommand.\n. BTW, you can create a local PyPI easily with [pip2pi](https://github.com/wolever/pip2pi). You don't even need a web server. In a package that _depends_ on ua-parser, have asetup.cfg` that looks like:\n[easy_install]\nindex_url = file:///Users/georger/.pip2pi/simple\nand python setup.py install will pull from ~/.pip2pi.\nIn fact, you don't even need pip2pi. You can just drop the ua-parser tarball created by python setup.py sdist into ~/.pip2pi/simple/ua-parser/.\n. I fixed an issue with the installer failing on Linux. I've pushed the fixes to my branch. See pull request #268 \nHere's my understanding of how it works.\npython setup.py develop in ua-parser source directory\n\nua-parser.egg-link is created in site-packages pointing back to source directory\nregexes.yaml and regexes.json get copied to py/ua_parser\n\npython setup.py install in ua-parser source directory\n\nua-parser is created in site-packages \nIt contains regexes.yaml and regexes.json\n\npython setup.py sdist in ua-parser source directory\n\ndist/ua-parser-VERSION.tar.gz is created\nIt contains regexes.yaml, py/ua_parser/regexes.yaml, and py/ua_parser/regexes.json\nThe tarball can be uploaded to a PyPI server\n\npython setup.py install in some other package\n\nEffectively the same as easy_install ua-parser\nThe sdist tarball is unpacked; then python setup.py bdist_egg is run\n\npip install ua-parser\n\nThe sdist tarball is unpacked; then python setup.py install is run\n\nRunning a PyPI\nYou can run a PyPI in your local filesystem.\n- Use pip2pi to populate it\n- For setuptools, create a setup.cfg in the current directory\n[easy_install]\nindex_url = file:///Users/georger/.pip2pi/simple\n- For pip, use -i flag\npip install ua-parser --index_url file:///Users/georger/.pip2pi/simple\n. See https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/279 for a patch that no longer requires pyyaml for 'setup.py install' or subsequently at runtime.\n. It turns out that the installer was broken on Linux (Python 2.7.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 amd64).\n. The version number should be bumped in setup.py, if only to 0.3.3.1, to ensure that the updated release works on PyPI.\n. I just noticed that the Python instructions in README.markdown say pip install pyyaml ua-parser. That can be simplified to pip install ua-parser for normal users.\n. I'm hitting this bug with regexex.yaml, if I use the PyYAML installed by install_requires = ['PyYAML'] when I do python setup.py develop.\nI'm trying this on a Mac with Python 2.7.3 installed by Homebrew.\nI'm also using virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper\nWhen I run @rascalking's patch, I get the following errors\n```\ngeorger@mac-georger:~/src/account_cob$ (master) mkvirtualenv account_cob\nNew python executable in account_cob/bin/python\nInstalling setuptools.............done.\nInstalling pip...............done.\n(account_cob)georger@mac-georger:~/src/account_cob$ (master) pip install git+git://github.com/rascalking/ua-parser.git@py-install-refactor#egg=ua-parser\nDownloading/unpacking ua-parser from git+git://github.com/rascalking/ua-parser.git@py-install-refactor#egg=ua-parser\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package ua-parser\nDownloading/unpacking pyyaml (from ua-parser)\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package pyyaml\nInstalling collected packages: ua-parser, pyyaml\n  Running setup.py install for ua-parser\n    Converting regexes.yaml to json...\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"\", line 1, in \n      File \"/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py\", line 54, in \n        'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules',\n      File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/core.py\", line 152, in setup\n        dist.run_commands()\n      File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/dist.py\", line 953, in run_commands\n        self.run_command(cmd)\n      File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/dist.py\", line 972, in run_command\n        cmd_obj.run()\n      File \"/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py\", line 24, in run\n        import yaml\n    ImportError: No module named yaml\n    Complete output from command /Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/bin/python -c \"import setuptools;file='/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py';exec(compile(open(file).read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n'), file, 'exec'))\" install --record /var/folders/j3/cblrmq691pd07lf4148ftplm0000gp/T/pip-CGT0q9-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --install-headers /Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/bin/../include/site/python2.7:\n    running install\nCopying regexes.yaml to package directory...\nConverting regexes.yaml to json...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"\", line 1, in \nFile \"/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py\", line 54, in \n'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules',\n\nFile \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/core.py\", line 152, in setup\ndist.run_commands()\n\nFile \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/dist.py\", line 953, in run_commands\nself.run_command(cmd)\n\nFile \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/distutils/dist.py\", line 972, in run_command\ncmd_obj.run()\n\nFile \"/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py\", line 24, in run\nimport yaml\n\nImportError: No module named yaml\n\nCommand /Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/bin/python -c \"import setuptools;file='/Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser/setup.py';exec(compile(open(file).read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n'), file, 'exec'))\" install --record /var/folders/j3/cblrmq691pd07lf4148ftplm0000gp/T/pip-CGT0q9-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --install-headers /Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/bin/../include/site/python2.7 failed with error code 1 in /Users/georger/pyenvs/account_cob/build/ua-parser\nStoring complete log in /Users/georger/.pip/pip.log\n``\n. @selwin, you're right, of course.

I think you need to do something withregexes.yamlin thebuild_pycommand.\n. BTW, you can create a local PyPI easily with [pip2pi](https://github.com/wolever/pip2pi). You don't even need a web server. In a package that _depends_ on ua-parser, have asetup.cfg` that looks like:\n[easy_install]\nindex_url = file:///Users/georger/.pip2pi/simple\nand python setup.py install will pull from ~/.pip2pi.\nIn fact, you don't even need pip2pi. You can just drop the ua-parser tarball created by python setup.py sdist into ~/.pip2pi/simple/ua-parser/.\n. I fixed an issue with the installer failing on Linux. I've pushed the fixes to my branch. See pull request #268 \nHere's my understanding of how it works.\npython setup.py develop in ua-parser source directory\n\nua-parser.egg-link is created in site-packages pointing back to source directory\nregexes.yaml and regexes.json get copied to py/ua_parser\n\npython setup.py install in ua-parser source directory\n\nua-parser is created in site-packages \nIt contains regexes.yaml and regexes.json\n\npython setup.py sdist in ua-parser source directory\n\ndist/ua-parser-VERSION.tar.gz is created\nIt contains regexes.yaml, py/ua_parser/regexes.yaml, and py/ua_parser/regexes.json\nThe tarball can be uploaded to a PyPI server\n\npython setup.py install in some other package\n\nEffectively the same as easy_install ua-parser\nThe sdist tarball is unpacked; then python setup.py bdist_egg is run\n\npip install ua-parser\n\nThe sdist tarball is unpacked; then python setup.py install is run\n\nRunning a PyPI\nYou can run a PyPI in your local filesystem.\n- Use pip2pi to populate it\n- For setuptools, create a setup.cfg in the current directory\n[easy_install]\nindex_url = file:///Users/georger/.pip2pi/simple\n- For pip, use -i flag\npip install ua-parser --index_url file:///Users/georger/.pip2pi/simple\n. See https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/pull/279 for a patch that no longer requires pyyaml for 'setup.py install' or subsequently at runtime.\n. It turns out that the installer was broken on Linux (Python 2.7.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 amd64).\n. The version number should be bumped in setup.py, if only to 0.3.3.1, to ensure that the updated release works on PyPI.\n. I just noticed that the Python instructions in README.markdown say pip install pyyaml ua-parser. That can be simplified to pip install ua-parser for normal users.\n. ",

About the second part of the question, maybe i didnt ask it correctly. ua-parser takes the approach to search the full UA for patterns, i was wondering if you knew of others who have scripted another approach of chopping the agent into segments and analyzing the segments to give the final result.\n. Well after seeing websites like UserAgentString.com and WhatsMyUA.com, i felt it was a method worth trying out, which i've been doing for the last couple of days, and a friend of mine asked me if someone had already done it and though i've checked, i hadnt found any, which is why i asked. Well i've been testing my work these last couple of days, which is why i've been submitting pulls for any errors i come across. It still needs work, but here is a preview.\n\n\n\n. Well the drawbacks i've seen so far are that if the parser cant cut the UA into correct pieces, then information maybe incorrectly joined together and possibly missed. Also sometimes parts of the information are in separate pieces, which mains you have to take the time to make sure it works correctly.\nThe main benefit has been that the extracted information is more extensive, so it would be easier to set some filtering rules to pull up related results.\n\nAs the array structure can easily be expanded on, its easy to add additional information into its structure. I've also decided to add error checking routines so i could for example easily detect safari's version, when it didnt have its version number in the UA.\nAs you can see from the earlier images, i'm also working on routines to strip down the UA as well as automatically convert it into a UA pattern, which makes it easy to determine unique UAs. With unique UAs, it should be easier to test a small set of UAs, which will definitely work on a larger set.\n. Sorry dont know what you mean by language agnostic. Dont know about crowd-source either.\n. i had read the history of the user agent string while i was doing my research about user agents and it was hilarious.\nThanks for the explanation. I hope that once i've completed it, i can release it as open source, as it would be my first and github will likely be its home for crowd sourcing. Yes i am happy that your project is language agnostic and hope i can do the same with my project if others would be willing to do the ports, as i can only handle the programming of it in php.\nThe project is built on php and javascript to accurate gather as much info as possible, as a user agent can easily be spoofed just relying on the http request.

In the end, I as a site owner can, more or less, provoke different compatibility modes, but as a basis for decisions that information is useless if I have no idea what browser version the user really has.\nCompatibility mode/emulated version is, of course, still very interesting, but as an additional information to the real version, not as the only information.\nI strongly argue that ua-parser as soon as possible should pick 4, and until that is ready or if a fallback for existing parser versions is needed, go for 1. Otherwise 3, but definitely not 2.\n. As @commenthol mentioned over at #318, this could possibly solve the problem with Internet Explorer compatibility modes (ua-parser today only gives the emulated IE version, not the real IE version). But then we would need not only the engine name, but also engine version.\nI am not familiar with the technical aspects of this proposal, but the idea is really great. This would make ua-parser truly relevant for analytical use.\n. @philipzae: Ah, great then!\nAnyone here not in favor of this idea? Or can we all agree that we want this implemented?\n.
