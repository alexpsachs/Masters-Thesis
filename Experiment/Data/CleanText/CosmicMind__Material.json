Can you update the name to SideNavViewController where appropriate and update the README?\n. If you update to the latest release 1.11.0, there are properties that may be set to add more spacing. \n\nFor example:\n// images\ncard.horizontalImageViewSpace = 32\ncard.verticalImageViewSpace = 32\n// title\ncard.horizontalTitleLabelSpace = 32\ncard.verticalTitleLabelSpace = 32\n// detail (description)\ncard.horizontalDetailLabelSpace = 32\ncard.verticalDetailLabelSpace = 32\n// buttons\ncard.horizontalButtonSpace = 32\ncard.verticalButtonSpace = 32\n. @cohix The added code in 1.12.0 is to support the manipulation of autolayout within the card. The limitation of the multiline support is the height restriction on the tittleLabel property. The feature you are looking for is being discussed in 1.13.0. \n. @cohix This is now fixed in issue-41, which I am pushing as a PR to development. Once merged you can use the development branch if you would like to utilize the feature prior to 1.13\n. @adamdahan This is fixed in issue-41. The PR will be coming in a moment. \n. Code may be found in SideNavigationViewController. \n. @NinjaIshere Hey, looks good :) can you PR only to development. Thanks\n. Yes, we have the initial fixes in place. I would like to run some tests and ensure some cleanups get in there. You should see it tomorrow if not later tonight :)\n. @cohix Still testing away, should be done soon.

There seems to be an issue that @cohix is facing, and at the moment, not reproducible on our end. There isn't an official release right now with iOS 9 support, as we are ensuring that there are not any edge cases we have not yet had a chance to expose.

Thanks :) Keep us posted. We are submitting an app on Sunday with MaterialKit and will see if any issues arise. \n. @NinjaIshere What is the size of the container that the MK card is going within?\n. If you could copy and paste the entire error output that would be great. But from your code, you have two vertical constraints, and really only need one. \n\nYour height doesn't need to be specified in the second Layout.size statement. \nYou should try: \nview.addConstraints(Layout.constraint(\"V:|-(pad)-[child(310)]\", options: [], metrics: [\"pad\": 60], views: [\"child\": card]))\n    Layout.width(view, child: card, width: 380)\nAlso, where are you getting the width 380 from? Are you trying to set it to the bounds of the view, as in, entirely across the screen. You would be better off doing: \nLayout.expandToParentHorizontally(view, child: card)\n. So from the constraint issues, I can tell that you are doing quite a bit to the view. Would you be able to add the entire block of code that generates the view and all manipulations you are doing to it. Also, please use dev and pull the latest, which will help determine if you are experiencing a legacy issue. \nThanks!\n. @NinjaIshere Did you try the latest dev with the code you have?\n. You should update again. \nBasicCard doesn\u2019t exist in the latest development branch.

I'm updating to the latest release as we speak. Is there any way I can get the ImageCardView in the development branch or something like that?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/GraphKit/MaterialKit/issues/60#issuecomment-145142010.\n. btw, what is your app?\n. Nice! Looks great :) Have a great weekend. \n. ImageCardView has been added. Please download the latest release 1.20.0. If you need any help using the new interface, let us know :)\n. So there isn't an actual UIImageView being used. That would make the card heavier than necessary. What is actually happening, the card uses an imageLayer that you can access. As well, the card itself will support an image background too. So to understand your question correctly, are you trying to make the card scale to the image size, so the card can support dynamic sizes of images?\n. I made the adjustment locally to achieve what you are looking for. In this version you don't have to do a thing, it will do it for you. With that said, I need to run the framework through some tests and I can push it up for you in a short while. Sound good?\n. It is a pleasure to make this available for everyone :) We will be doing some meet ups soon, and we would be happy to have a round then. As well, you are helping us make a better product, we appreciate that. \n. Hey, so the dynamic sizing of ImageCardView has been added. We took this opportunity to add a bunch of tweaks we wanted to get in. Also, there is an additional property, maxImageSize for ImageCardView that doesn't allow the image height to get too long, this avoids any awkward looking cards. You can either not set the maxImageSize value or set it to 0 and it will allow any dynamic height size. I'll leave it to you to explore the new features. \n\nPro tip* We added a new layer called MaterialLayer. It is really lightweight compared to a UIView and MaterialView. So if you are looking for the neat abilities without the weight, that is a nice option. \nAll the best :)\n. great :)\nOn Tue, Oct 13, 2015 at 11:33 AM, Connor Hicks notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThat's awesome! I'm testing now. Looks great!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/GraphKit/MaterialKit/issues/63#issuecomment-147752228\n.\n. Hey :) \n\nThat is a very specific use case. Preferably, I would like to keep the card more generic. \nOne way of doing it, could be to add a tap gesture on the card and see if the tap is within the bounds of the image frame, which you can access from the optional imageLayer property that is set when you add an image. \n. Actually, an even better approach would be to subclass the ImageCardView, which is a subclass of MaterialPulseView. Override the touchesBegan method, and if the touch is within the imageLayer execute your lightbox, if not, call the super.touchesBegan method. \n. public override func touchesBegan(touches: Set, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {\nlet point: CGPoint = layer.convertPoint(touches.first!.locationInView(self), fromLayer: layer)\n    if true == imageLayer?.containsPoint(point) {\n        ...\n    } else {\n                  super.touchesBegan(touches, withEvent: event)\n            }\n}\nI haven't tested the code, though this is the idea. \n. You can do the same with touchesEnd, which may be better to keep the pulse in general, though, you have to call super in that case to shrink the pulse. \n. Awesome :) How are you liking MaterialKit? We are planning a really awesome update shortly.\n. Great! Okay, after your experimentation, let us know how it worked out and close the ticket. All the best :)\n. Hey, that is a good one, though it wouldn't make it into MaterialKit, it would be added to ContentKit. I made a ticket for that here: https://github.com/GraphKit/ContentKit/issues/8. If you are looking for a solution immediately, this may help: https://github.com/mayoff/uiimage-from-animated-gif. I am going to close this ticket here and if you like, please follow the one I placed above. \n. @adamdahan https://github.com/CosmicMind/MaterialKit/blob/development/Source/MaterialColor.swift Cyan is spelled correctly. \n. Have some more details?\n. @WooD1k This is being pushed today with examples :)\n. @WooD1k We added Storyboard examples and programmatic examples. For the SideNavigationViewController, it is not currently possible to use Storyboards on the Controller itself, though, the mainViewController, and sideViewController may use Storyboards. We included an example of how to set this up. We are planning to make some additions to the SideNavigationViewController in general, so this issue will be looked at in more detail. The reason we cannot support it, is because of how the views are currently laid out.\nIf you need any more assistance, please keep us posted. Thank you! \n. @avgx great suggestion, will be in our next release.\n. @avgx Carthage is now supported :)\n. Done :)\n. @jovincroninwilesmith fully agree :) The upcoming week has some additional updates. If the text field does not get in by the end of this week, it will be in the following week. \n. Sweet :) We are glad that we have support as we have a wonderful roadmap being put together to build a great framework :) I am going to leave this ticket open to track the progression of your feature request. \n. Moving this to the upcoming RoadMap, and closing for now. Thank you!\n. Good question. The initial design of the SideNavigation was to be simple, so we didn't include a swapping mechanism. There are two solutions that you can immediately use, and soon we will add support for your question.\n1. You can do what you suggested and swap out the SideNavigationController. \n2. You can place a base UIViewController as the mainViewController and internally swap child UIViewControllers as you see fit, this has benefits in general over a direct swap, such as centralizing logic etc... \nI do believe there is a need to have support for swapping out UIViewControllers internally within SideViewController, so we can leave this ticket open and we will add support for it.\n. @rockwotj Nice solution, we will look at this issue further and make a smoother process for swapping. Thanks for reaching out. I will close this ticket now, and put the feature within our internal roadmap. Thanks! \n. @adamdahan Let's plan this in for our next release with a swap with animation effect. \n. Moving the issue to the upcoming RoadMap, and closing for now. Thank you! \n. Use the SideNavigationController transitionFromRootViewController method. \n. If you want to support the backButton, then you need to use a NavigationController as your rootViewController in the SideNavigationController. The option is also to use a NavigationController in the AppLeftViewController to support the backButton there as well. \n. Hi @kktam I am preparing an example project with what I believe you are looking for. We can go from there :)\n. @kktam I have placed an example project for MaterialLayout in the Examples directory. In order to support your request I started working on functions that support  AutoLayout sibling relationships. This will most likely be done today. If you cannot wait, I suggest looking into UIStackView which allows for horizontal and vertical alignment of sibling views, or use AutoLayout through its raw interface. \nThe feature you are looking for is very important so it is currently my focus.\n. @kktam There is an example project in v1.24.11, which I just released that I believe supports what you are looking for. You are able to align views horizontally and vertically with outer margins, as well as, spacing between the views. In the example, I show how to print out the frame dimensions after they have been laid out. If you have any further questions please reopen or create a new issue. All the best :)\n. Good catch. The issue is the .gitignore file was not catching *.framework files. So references to the build path on my computer were left in. The correct method of installing the framework is to build the MaterialKit on a device or Generic Device schema setting. Then in the project you want to launch, press the Embed Framework button and add the framework. I will make instructions on how to do this shortly. Let me know if you need any other help. \n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Dec 12, 2015, at 10:17 PM, Ka Tam notifications@github.com wrote:\nI have one more interesting observation.

Ah okay :) I didn't want to hold you up for that issue.

A supported solution will be ready for Monday. All the best. \n. @rockwotj Hey, we added the mainViewController swap in release 1.24.13. Let us know if there are any issues. There is an example in the Examples Programmatic directory.\n. Cool :) I will look into this.

This project would be a great place for that. \n. @sohayb I am going to close this now.\n\nThe reason I am closing this, is that there was a large update and more to come, and this project will no longer reflect a complete example. If you would like, you are always welcome to open a new ticket with examples and such. \nThank you! :)\n. Hi @skywinder Thank you for submitting this PR. I will need to consider how this plays into our overall flow, as we are reviewing some options currently. Let's leave this up for now, and shortly I will be able to respond to it accordingly. Awesome work and thank you!\n. @sohayb Yes, there is. We have new components coming out, TextField and SearchBarView are  amongst them. Our roadmap will be up shortly. If you have any further questions, please re-open or create a new issue :) \n. I am anticipating by Wednesday if not sooner. This upcoming week there will be a bunch of releases to help support the growth of MaterialKit :) \n. I am not able to reproduce the issue. \n1. Is this using Storyboards?\n2. Version of test device?\n3. May you send some code that shows the construction of the CardView?\n. If you do not want it to be public, please send to support@cosmicmind.io :) \n. Hey @sohayb :) \nI reviewed your example code and I believe it is best I answer here so that others may learn from the issue you had pointed out. Within the CardView there is a method called reloadView that is called when a property is altered from its original value, in this case CardView.divider = false. Internal to the reloadView method, AutoLayout is used to create the CardView layout. It looks that the CardView is not actually holding any of its known property values, and a UILabel is added to the CardView to create the effect you are looking for. Since the CardView doesn't have a titleLabel, detailLabel, buttons, or divider, it concludes  using AutoLayout that there is not anything to layout and a height of 0 is applied. \nMy suggestion would be to use a MaterialView in this case, which would give you the backgroundColor, shadow, and shape that it looks like you are trying to achieve. If you want a pulse animation, you can use the MaterialPulseView, and if you are looking for a button.target, the RaisedButton looks to be the one you would want in this instance. \nThoughts?\n. No worries. If you want a button, why not use one of the MaterialButtons? They are fully customizable like the views. They also support an image layer with button.setImage(\u2026)\n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Dec 13, 2015, at 2:41 PM, Sohayb Hassoun notifications@github.com wrote:\nYou're right, I'm not using the CardView where it's supposed to be used, so the error is by design (my case is an odd one, sry for that :) )\nWanted to place a button with an image on it, so I should be better off with the MaterialPulseView.\nClosing this for now\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/CosmicMind/MaterialKit/issues/87#issuecomment-164290407.\n.

It didn't make sense to write what StackView already provides. I am going to close this, but if you have any further issues, please re-open and let me know. \n. I believe I made the change a day or two ago and pushed the release. One of the aspects I am looking to improve on is a release and roadmap area. I appreciate your effort with the sample project. Thank you!\n. I delete the programmatic example for MaterialStackView. Can you confirm this?\n. in release 1.25.2?\n. We are talking about this class? MaterialStackView?\n. I realized what happened. When I had deleted it from Xcode, it deleted the project but not the directory. I fixed that now and pushed a new version 1.25.3. Thank you again :) \n. Yes pretty much. CardView is like any other UIView when it comes to adding it as a child in the view hierarchy. Depending on your usage you would decide on a CollectionView or TableView. That said, the only issue you would face is the sizing of the CardView within the CollectionViewCell or TableViewCell, which depends on how you set your views up. \nThere are more examples coming that would clearly highlight this. When the SearchBarView is added, there will be an example with a dynamic list to show the results. That example will use a view like CardView within the cells of the list. \nI am going to close this issue, if you have any further questions, please re-open the issue or make a new one :) \n. Yes, you are missing the image itself. You can find that here https://design.google.com/icons/. I am closing this issue, if you need any further help, please re-open or create a new ticket. :)\n. Hi @sohayb Can you make this PR against Development? Thank you!\n. For the raisedButton, you don't need to use the .layer.zPosition property. You can do raisedButotn.zPosition :) Great that you fixed it. \n. Hi, can you send me the initialization code you are using and the version of MK? Thank you!\n. Is the breakage occurring when the user logs in and you switch the controller, or is it happening when they are already logged in? Or both?\n. So two things. \nThe issue is complaining about BAD_ACCESS, which means that somewhere there is a reference to an object that no longer exists. This could be because of using Storyboards. We do not offer full Storyboard support at this time. \nFurther more, rather than using two instances of SideViewController, have you thought of using a single setup that swaps the mainViewController if the user is logged in or becomes logged in? This may help in the memory management of the object. \nI cannot see anything that screams issue in the code. So it is strange that a BAD_ACCESS issue is arising. \nBefore I run further testing on this, is it possible to update to the latest version and run these tests?\n. Yes, I understand. I am updating the closures and animations to use more elaborate ARC support, which would ensure that no cycles occur.\n. @adamdahan Can you try and reproduce this issue. Thank you!\n. @banxi1988 The workaround that you are doing shouldn't be needed. @adamdahan and I have found a couple things that may be causing the issue. I will let @adamdahan share more about the storyboard usage and how to avoid @LarsDR issue when setting them up. Generally, what is happening with the \nswift\nMaterialAnimation.animationDisabled {\n...\n}\nis that the animationDisabled is capturing a lazy loaded property, which is increasing ARCs reference count for that object. What should be happening within the block -- is usage of the sideView with an unowned or weak reference, as well, the lazy property should be converted to an optional and when prepareSideView is called, the sideView may be instantiated thus passing a single reference to the animation block.\nI am going to make the changes today and issue a release. Then if you guys can test and try and reproduce the issue, that would be great!\n. Please try the latest release 1.26.0. There were changes made to the internals of SideNavigationViewController in order to solve the bugs that were described in this issue. As mentioned, we were not able to reproduce the issues specified, so any help in determining if the bug still exists would be much appreciated. Please reopen or create a new ticket if the bug persists. Thank you!\n. Awesome! \n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Dec 22, 2015, at 8:48 PM, banxi notifications@github.com wrote:\n@danieldahan Hi,I Just try 1.26.0 and It' works very well.\nThank you.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Hi @sohayb, I have been thinking about this PR quite a bit. Thinking if adding a validation method is something MaterialKit should be responsible for, or should it be a decision by the developer to make a validation method in their own way. The issue that I have is that the detailLabel is really meant to be a lower label with priority over the titleLabel when active. Whether this label be used to show an error message, or show a helpful piece of information is up to the app design. I think by tying in the validation method we are losing that flexibility. What I would rather do is make a subclass TextField component that adds additional features, such as validation. This way there is always a raw version of the TextField. \n\nThoughts?\n. Hi @sohayb For now I am going to close this PR. Thank you for submitting it. \n. Hi @sohayb I agree that the error block is a nice addition. My concern is how it is added. If I move the TextField class to a MaterialTextField, it would be great to keep the class raw and as customizable as possible. Then, a subclass of MaterialTextField, called TextField should add the features you are describing. This way, if we want to use the raw MaterielTextField in other components and such, it is not adding the validation logic that may not be needed. Part of the issue when bringing Material Design to iOS is the difference between bringing the style and bringing the language library features. The style is what we are trying to do, the language flow and implementation is a different matter entirely. Overall, I like the addition. I didn't want to leave it hanging here with the CLA still needing to be signed and I had not even given a review yet to the code --- styling and consistency with the framework. \n. In general subclassing MaterialKit components is not necessary. The easiest way would be to use a CardView and set the appropriate properties. Something like this: \nlet cardView: CardView = CardView()\ncardView.titleLabel = UILabel()\ncardView.titleLabel!.text = \"Use Google's location service?\"\n// ... add styling\ncardView.detailLabel = UILabel()\ncardView.detailLabel!.text = \"Let Google help ... running.\"\n// ... add styling\n// make flat buttons (disagree, agree)\ncardView.rightButtons = [disagree, agree]\nWhen you do the positioning, MaterialLayout would make this easy. \nWhen you do the depth, probably looking for .Depth5\ncardView.shadowDepth = .Depth5\n. If you have any further questions, feel free to re-open or create a new ticket :)\n. I haven\u2019t played with what you are trying to do enough to have an accurate answer. Are you required to use an AlertView?\n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Dec 20, 2015, at 12:01 AM, Paul Van Wieren notifications@github.com wrote:\nHere's my current UIAlertController code:\nlet alert = UIAlertController(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle: .Alert)\n    let action = UIAlertAction(title: \"Dismiss\", style: .Default, handler: nil)\n    alert.addAction(action)\n    presentViewController(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/CosmicMind/MaterialKit/issues/104#issuecomment-166067423.\n. I will put it in upcoming :)\n. Hi @tengis Would you be able to share the code you are using to setup the NavigationBarView?\n. The MaterialLayout.width line would conflict with the MaterialLayout.alignToParentHorizontally(view, child: navigationBarView) line.\n\nIt looks like you are using the code directly from the example. \nHmmm... nothing screams issue here. When are you calling this setup code? Also, are you using the latest? 1.25.8?\n. Can you remove all code after this line view.addSubview(navigationBarView). \nThat should size the NavigationBarView to your screen width x 70 px. I think you want to support rotation, so we wont use this solution in the end, but I want to see that it draws correctly and we are eliminating variables. \n. That is good. If you want to support rotation, you will want the previous lines there. What those lines are basically saying is stretch to the parent view horizontally and set the height to 70. This then leads to the TableViewController's view bounds. Is the tableview being spread across the screen width completely? \n. Sorry, I don't fully understand what you meant. When you scroll the TableViewController the navbar is moving with it? Did you set the MaterialLayout values back? Is the \"yes\" for my previous question that you confirmed the TableViewController is set to the width of the screen's dimensions?\n. If you would like, you can send a sample project over to support@cosmicmind.io and I will take a look, rather than the back and forth questions. If that is easier. \n. I would have to see what is going on. My immediate suggestion is to use a normal ViewController and set the NavigationBarView as a child of that view, then add a tableView to that controller as well. \n. Anytime :)\n. Yeah, do you want to list some that you think would be nice to add within the next month?\n. Great suggestions. We have a few additions to that internally that we have already prototyped, so let's aim to make this library that one stop shop :). Why we don't just launch so many components is to ensure that the quality of the rollout is high. So far we are happy with the feedback. We also don't just want to be components. We want to help in the journey when building applications, so we are looking to build solid foundations that will grow. \nThank you for your support. \n. @adamdahan Take a look at the list :)\n. Yes, how did we forget that one :)\n. Closing this, as the list is updated. \n. Hi @sohayb, you should set the \"View controller-based status bar appearance\" to \"NO\"\nLet me know :)\n. You have to set the value in the info.plist file.\n. @vishiswoz To clarify, are you meaning that when you click on a button, that the mainViewController transitions to a new one? \n. Thank you @sohayb :)\n.

Please add the details of the device or simulator you are running it on, and the error console text. \nAs well, it seems that this may be better suited for StackOverflow. We are moving implementation issues to Stack and only dealing with bugs here. Thanks! \n. Are you using CocoaPods?\n. Is Carthage compiling the framework in Release mode? If so, that would cause an issue, because optimization would be on. I checked the MaterialKit project and optimizations are off in debug mode and are on in Release mode. \n. try this\ncarthage update --configuration debug\n. I think I know what it is, I am making an update now to MaterialKit. One moment. \n. try version 1.27.6\n. To solve the bad access I made an adjustment, try 1.27.7. As for the AutoLayout issue, in your code\nswift\n[MaterialLayout alignToParent:self.view child:textView top:124.0f left:24.0f bottom:24.0f right:24.0f options:0];\n    [self.view addSubview:textView];\nYou are setting the textView as a child after the AutoLayout constraints are being set. It should be done before. \nswift\n [self.view addSubview:textView];\n[MaterialLayout alignToParent:self.view child:textView top:124.0f left:24.0f bottom:24.0f right:24.0f options:0];\n. try 1.27.8, I added the @objc. \n. I am going to close this ticket. If the issue persists, please reopen it, or create a new one. All the best!\n. I would need a working example to reproduce the issue. We can reopen this, but please provide something that will reproduce the issue. You can send the project to support@cosmicmind.io\nThank you!\n. Well I had mentioned that these two lines: \n[MaterialLayout alignToParent:self.view child:textView top:124.0f left:24.0f bottom:24.0f right:24.0f options:0];\n    [self.view addSubview:textView];\nneed to be switched to: \n[self.view addSubview:textView];\n[MaterialLayout alignToParent:self.view child:textView top:124.0f left:24.0f bottom:24.0f right:24.0f options:0];\nAutoLayout does not support creating constraints prior to the view being added as a child. \n. So to better see the issue and help you, a reproducible project would help :) \n. Yes, no worries. \n. Yes, I received it. I will take a look :)\n. So there were somethings you had not done in the setup. The \"text\" object was not initialized, and the \"textContainer\" was not added to the \"layoutManager\". Below is the corrected code based on what you had written. \n```\nNSLayoutManager layoutManager = [[NSLayoutManager alloc] init];\n    NSTextContainer textContainer = [[NSTextContainer alloc] initWithSize:self.view.bounds.size];\n    [layoutManager addTextContainer:textContainer];\ntext = [[Text alloc] init];\ntext.delegate = self;\n[text.textStorage addLayoutManager:layoutManager];\n\ntextView = [[TextView alloc] initWithTextContainer:textContainer];\ntextView.delegate = self;\n[textView setFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:20]];\n\n[textView setPlaceholderLabel:[[UILabel alloc] init]];\n[[textView placeholderLabel] setTextColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:224.0f/255.0f green:224.0f/255.0f blue:224.0f/255.0f alpha:1.0f]];\n[[textView placeholderLabel] setText:@\"Choose Date\"];\n\n[textView setTitleLabel:[[UILabel alloc] init]];\n[textView.titleLabel setFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:12]];\ntextView.titleLabelColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:224.0f/255.0f green:224.0f/255.0f blue:224.0f/255.0f alpha:1.0f];\ntextView.titleLabelActiveColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:41.0f/255.0f green:121.0f/255.0f blue:255.0f/255.0f alpha:1.0f];\n\n[self.view addSubview:textView];\n[textView setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:NO];\n[MaterialLayout alignToParent:self.view child:textView top:300 left:10 bottom:10 right:10 options:0];\n\n```\n.

I'll be looking at your issue in a couple hours. Shouldn't take long to have an answer for you. \n. So the issue is the shadow effect that is behind the sideNav. You need to set it to .None. \n\nAdd this code to the SideViewController. \nswift\noverride func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n    sideNavigationViewController?.backdropColor = nil\n    sideNavigationViewController?.depth = .None\n}\nThe other thing you may want to do is remove the backdropColor. That can be done by adding this value to the viewWillAppear method, which I did above. \nswift\nsideNavigationViewController?.backdropColor = nil\nThen, in the prepareTableView method, add this code, which properly sets up the blurEffect. \n``` swift\nif !UIAccessibilityIsReduceTransparencyEnabled() {\n    tableView.backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor()\n    let blurEffect = UIBlurEffect(style: .Light)\n    let blurEffectView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: blurEffect)\n    tableView.backgroundView = blurEffectView\n//if you want translucent vibrant table view separator lines\ntableView.separatorEffect = UIVibrancyEffect(forBlurEffect: blurEffect)\n\n}\n```\nAnd last of all, you may need to set the cell backgroundColor to a clear color. \nswift\ncell.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.clear\nI truly wish this question was on Stack as many people could benefit from the answer. You inspired me to make a cool example using these effects. I will launch that shortly. \nIf you have any other issue please reopen or create a new ticket. \nAll the best! \n. Hey, yes. There is a property you can set that will adjust the distance for you. For example:\ntextField.titleLabelAnimationDistance = 4\n. Yes, there are plans. We are working on many new features and that is one of them :)\nI'd say start playing with MaterialKit if you like its direction, so when the updates come, you are ready at full speed. \nThe new features focus a lot on navigation and transitions. \n:) \n. The new features will start rolling out in February. Exact dates, not sure.\n. You are getting the not found error, because MaterialKit.framework needs to be embedded in the project you want to run.\nFor example:\n1.

That would cause maintenance and linking errors. A framework cannot avoid the setup, which is why organizations like CocoaPods and Carthage have emerged. Either way, this issue is considered solved. Please feel free to reopen or create a new issue if any arise. Thank you!\n. Which example are you trying to run? MaterialKit should be Material.

Hey, you may be looking for this method, transitionFromMainViewController.\nIt allows you to switch the mainViewController with animation and transition options. \nI will add an example of using this feature in my next update. \n. There is a breakage here. \n. I am looking into it. \n. @xaviermawet @chaitanya-ramji \nSo the issue is, the RecipesViewController has a line of code in the viewWillDisappear method that disables the sideNavigationController\nswift\nsideNavigationController?.enabled = false\nThat line should actually go into the ItemViewController's viewWillAppear method. Once that change is made, you will find that this line of code in the AppLeftViewController works as expected. \nswift\nfunc tableView(tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) {\n        sideNavigationController?.transitionFromRootViewController(VideoViewController(), duration: 0.4, options: .CurveEaseIn, animations: nil, completion: { [unowned self] _ in\n            self.sideNavigationController?.closeLeftView()\n        })\n    }\nThat should work for you :)\n. Are you using obj-c or swift? \n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Jan 26, 2016, at 5:02 PM, Marcoaferrer notifications@github.com wrote:\nim getting a class name conflict with the class \"Text\" The name is used in SVGKit and another library Im using I was considering refactoring it to a different name and building my own version of the pibrary I just wanted to bring it up just in case you think it would better to update the library as to avoid conflicts\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Hi @kruyvanna, I know what the issue is. I am going to offer you a fix and then update Material to handle this issue. \nSome insight: All CALayers are by default animated, when altering properties etc. A UIView has a backing layer, that is a CALayer. When used through a UIView, the animations are disabled and only turned on when you use the UIView.animate.... block methods. In Material, we turn the animations on by default. So internally, there is a conflict that we need to handle. \nHere is a quick fix to give you the desired outcome, and in the next release, we will handle this issue and you will be able to use the UIView, without any additions. \nFix: \nswift\nMaterialAnimation.delay(2) {\nUIView.animateWithDuration(0.4, delay: 0, usingSpringWithDamping: 0.6, initialSpringVelocity: 0,      options: UIViewAnimationOptions.AllowUserInteraction, animations: {\n                self.aFabButton.frame.origin.x =400\n     }, completion: nil)\n}\nThe next release will happen later today, but for now, this should work. Please reply to this issue to confirm it works, or later today when I make the release, I will close this issue. \n. This is now fixed and will be in release 1.29.2\n. Excellent :) \n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Feb 3, 2016, at 11:00 PM, Kruy Vanna notifications@github.com wrote:\nhi @danieldahan i confirm it's working.\nThanks for the insights!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Hi, @Chris-Sipe \n\nYou need to embed the Material.framework in the project you want to run. By default, they are not embedded, to avoid build errors and version conflicts.

Your code looks correct. As for this line, \n\nswift\nMaterialLayout.alignFromTop(contentView, child: imageCardView, top: 0)\nif the top property is 0, then it doesn't need to be specified. \nWhy are you using the UITableView? Is it for the scrolling feature, or swipe to Action? There could be a better solution, based on your usage.\n. Let me know how it works out. A UICollectionView is a lighter and more flexible approach with an ImageCardView, if it is going to be used as a feed of content. I am making an example of this, and will post shortly.\nI am closing this issue, if you have any further questions, either reopen this issue, or create a new one. \nAll the best! \n. Have you had a chance to look at the example projects in Examples/Storyboards? There is an example using the buttons. \n. Hi @JoeShi,\nI like your idea. I will provide functionality to trigger the pulse programmatically. \n. Hey @JoeShi, \nWe added the programmatic pulse trigger for you. It Optionally takes in a point within the view to trigger the pulse animation from, otherwise defaults to the center. \nAn example may be found here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/wiki/MaterialPulseView\nIf you have any further questions, please reopen this ticket, use StackOverflow, or create a new issue. \n. Hi @nhnam, thank you for sending this to us. We are going to add instructions to the Installation section of the wiki.\n. :) All the best!\n. Hi @havocked, \nYes, you can achieve this without having to modify the source. These are the steps I would try:\nSet the sideNavigationViewController?.enabled property to false. This will disable the panning gesture when closed. It will also disable the toggle functionality. So when you click on the button you want to have open the side nav, set the enabled property back to true, and toggle it open. The user will now have the ability to slide the side nav closed, or tap it closed. \nWith the delegation methods available, use the ...DidClose... delegation method to detect when the user closed it. Once closed, whether from panning or tapping, set the enabled property back to false. \nThis should work, and it would be what I would do to avoid any code fuss. \n. :) thank u\n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Feb 5, 2016, at 9:26 AM, Nataniel martin notifications@github.com wrote:\nAlright, thanks again for your cool work !\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Through Storyboards, I don't believe it will work. You could however use Storyboards for your ViewControllers, and then you would only need to set the SideNav's left or right width programmatically. \n\nYou would use these lines: \nswift\nsideNavigationViewController?.setLeftViewWidth(300, hidden: true, animated: false)\nsideNavigationViewController?.setRightViewWidth(300, hidden: true, animated: false)\nIn order for those lines to work correctly, it would need to be done in the viewWillAppear method of your ViewController, or after the instantiation of the SideNav in the AppDelegate. \nHere are two examples:\n``` swift\nfunc application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n// Get view controllers from storyboard\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet mainViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"MainViewController\") as! MainViewController\nlet sideViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"SideViewController\") as! SideViewController\nlet sideNavigationViewController: SideNavigationViewController = SideNavigationViewController(mainViewController: mainViewController, leftViewController: sideViewController)\nsideNavigationViewController.setLeftViewWidth(300, hidden: true, animated: false)\n// Configure the window with the SideNavigationViewController as the root view controller\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\nwindow?.rootViewController = sideNavigationViewController\nwindow?.makeKeyAndVisible()\nreturn true\n}\n```\n// or \nswift\noverride func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {\nsuper.viewWillAppear(animated)\nsideNavigationViewController?.setLeftViewWidth(view.bounds.width - 88, hidden: true, animated: false)\n}\nThe reason for placing it in the viewWillAppear, if you choose that route, is because of the race-condition which would occur when instantiating the views and placing them within the SideNav.init method. Basically, the SideNav, won't exist at that time. \nHope this works for you :)\n. If you have any further questions, please reopen or create a new issue. All the best :)\n. You can use the same titleLabelInset and contentInset properties to align\nboth vertically and horizontally. :)\nOn Sun, Feb 7, 2016 at 6:07 PM Sohayb Hassoun notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nhi @adamdahan https://github.com/adamdahan\nActually my concern is that it's not centred vertically, not talking about\nthe horizontal position.\nThanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/148#issuecomment-181138497\n.\n.

Being added to the next release. Thanks for double checking on this. \n. It is possible to add a UITableView to a CardView, though, it may be awkward to work with it. What kind of layout are you trying to achieve? I will recommend an approach. \n. What parts of the CardView are you planning to display, title? detail? etc... the reason I ask, is because if you want an overlay, like the CardView with a tableView in it. You can easily accomplish that with a MaterialView, or MaterialPulseView, and set the depth property to the appropriate depth. If you are looking to have buttons and all the features CardView provides, then you can add the tableView as a child of the cardView and use the insets to space everything correctly. If you further explain the layout you are looking to achieve, I will provide you some code to get you going. \n. I am going to release an update to the CardView that will allow you to use this option, and really any option of any view in the detail area. The example project will use a UITableView as one of the examples. Give me about an hour. \n. Thanks for the challenge :) Now CardView and ImageCardView support a property called detailView that allows any view to be in the detail area. There is an example project, Examples/Programmatic/CardView/TableCardView that shows how to achieve what you are looking for :)\n. That is coming. We are working on a bunch when it comes to CaptureView. This month those updates will rollout. For now I will close this issue :)\n. Nice :) I will test this out and when we make our release today, it will include a fix. I'll keep you posted. \n. Where are the two places you made the change?\n. Excellent, I made the changes. This will be out later today. I will close the issue once the release is made. Thank you! \n. I am closing this ticket. The fix is in the next release. Thanks again :)\n. Hey, sorry about that. The math was using points and didn't take the screen scale into account. I had made a fix for it. This will be released in the next release, which is pushed to tomorrow, rather than today. If you would like to correct it, the best thing would be to grab the development file TextField for this Commit.\n. I am closing this ticket. The fix is in the next release. Thanks again :)\n. Probably in a week, no later than this month. \n. :) Hey, what version are you using?\n. Interesting, I can't seem to reproduce it. Before the next release, which I am planning for today, I will continue to try and reproduce the issue. :) If I can find it, I will make a fix, otherwise, we will need to try another approach, or it may have been resolved with the current work I am doing. \n. I haven't been able to reproduce this. Please update to the latest version, and if the issue persists, reopen the issue or create a new one. \n\nAll the best! \n. I had made a fix for this that is ready in the next release. I am going to try the lineHeight approach and see which gives the best results. Excellent find and suggestion, thank you. As for contributing, I will make it more clear on how to do that. Thank you!\n. If you look in the development branch, the fix is in both TextField and TextView. Would you be able to confirm that it is working for you?\n. so cornerRadius is a CGFloat now to solve Storyboard support, and there is an added cornerRadiusPreset property that allows you to use the MaterialRadius enum types. This pattern will follow for other properties as well. \n. Yes, the enum property settings are moving to the ***Preset property values so that Storyboards can be better supported.\nswift\nobj.cornerRadius = 3\nobj.cornerRadiusPreset = .Radius3\n. try getting rid of this line\nswift\nc3.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n. I set this up: \n``` swift\nfunc switchState() {\n    let defaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults()\n    defaults.setBool(true, forKey: \"SwitchState\")\n    print(defaults.objectForKey(\"SwitchState\"))\n}\nfunc checkSwitchState() {\n    let defaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults()\n    if defaults.objectForKey(\"SwitchState\") === true {\n        print(\"yes\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"no\")\n    }\n}\n// Somewhere call\nswitchState()\ncheckSwitchState()\n```\n- Output In Console: \n  Optional(1)\n  yes\nThen comment out switchState() and relaunch the application.\n- Output In Console\n  yes\nAll seems to work. \n. Are you wiping your UserDefaults somewhere? Usually people do this at app launch. \n. If you want flexible persistence, try Graph\nYou would be able to do this. \n``` swift\nfunc switchState() {\n   let graph: Graph = Graph()\n   let status: Entity = Entity(type: \"Status\")\n   status[\"switchState\"] = true\n   graph.save()\n}\nfunc checkSwitchState() {\n   let graph: Graph = Graph()\n   let status: Entity? = graph.searchForEntity(types: [\"Status\"]).last\n   if true === status?[\"switchState\"] as? Bool {\n       // do something \n   }\n}\n```\nI haven't checked the code, but that should work for you. \n. Use the setSwitchState method. \nswift\nsetSwitchState(state: MaterialSwitchState, animated: Bool = true, completion: ((control: MaterialSwitch) -> Void)? = nil)\n. In the next release, I will support setting the switchState through a property that will default with an animation. \n. no \nswift\nc2.setSwitchState(.On)\nor\nswift\nc2.setSwitchState(.off)\n. The previous was the definition of the method. You don't need to set properties when they are defaulted in the parameter declaration. \n. :) anytime\n. Thank you for sharing this. I will be looking at this tomorrow. In general, the PR should go to the development branch. I will have a Contributing Guideline in the next release. \n.

No worries, did you need help with something?\n. Hi @mertnesvat, have you looked at these instructions https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/wiki/Installation?\nThanks @chaitanya-ramji :)\n. Hi @terflogag,\nWhich project, and on what device? Have you looked at these instructions: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/wiki/Installation?\n. Hmmm... I just tried both and they seem to be working fine. Have you embedded the Material.framework? What device are you doing this on, or simulator?\n. Try clearing the build directory and Derived Date directory. \n. Nice find. Thank you! This PR would need to go to the development branch. I will post that information on the Contribution page and will add this update. \n. Hi @terflogag \nAre you trying to change the mainViewController? If so, there is a \nswift\ntransitionFromMainViewController\nmethod that you can use. Otherwise, there are ways to make the push work and such, but it takes more effort.\n. :) Great!\n. By the way, you can add more transition animations using the MaterialAnimation.transition method. \nAdd the transition to the addAnimation method like so\nswift\nController.view.layer.addAnimation(MaterialAnimation.transition(.MoveIn, direction: .Bottom), forKey: kCATransitionFromBottom)\nthen use the \nswift\ntransitionFromMainViewController\nmethod. That is a hidden gem :)\nThat is off the top of my head, sorry if I have a spelling issue. But that is the main idea.\n. Can you try this version 1.34.3 please?\n. I am closing this ticket. Feel free to reopen it or create a new one if the problem persists. \n. It is already done that way, using maskToBounds and understanding the layering system. What are you trying to place as a subview, and I can better help you from there. \n. Okay, I'll play with the internals a bit and see if I can make this really easy, otherwise, I will explain an approach you can take. I want to make sure my solution doesn't cause a UIView hierarchy issue. \n. This is in the queue. Didn't forget about you :)\n. If you use a CardView, then you can set the detailView value with the UIView you want to have clipped. Set the CardView divider property to false as well. I will look into making a view that handles this as a direct feature. Thanks and all the best! Sorry this took so long to respond too, has been really busy. \n. @zgosalvez  Yes, that is correct. The pulse is an underlying layer. So it does not cover text or content. Setting the defaultView to a clear background color allows it to still be seen. \n. Thank you :)\nYes this came as an adjustment from the Material Design spec. What I think is that a flag should be set to enable or disable that feature, auto-hiding the detailLabel. This would keep the internals safe from exposure, and give both outcomes. Thoughts? \n. Cool, this will be out later today. I'll leave the issue up and take it down when I make the release. Generally, Material and other frameworks we make, are geared towards no-fuss, while removing the need for hacky code. This was a great suggestion. Thanks ! \n. Here is the 1.34.4 release, which solves your issue, and there is an example in the Examples/Programmatic/TextField project.\n:) All the best\n. Thank you! The examples are fixed in 1.34.5.\n. Hi @dsempel,\nThank you for this. I am able to reproduce the issue. There is a release later today that will have a fix. \n. Hi @alexvbush \nBefore the release today, we will look into this and either make a fix or provide a suggestion :)\n. Hi @alexvbush Sorry, for the delay.\nI don't see the tintColor set for the textField. Can you try and set the tintColor\nswift\nnameTextField.tintColor = MaterialColor.green.darken4\n. I tested this programmatically and through storyboards. I can't replicate the issue. There is an added storyboards project that shows TextFields in use in the Examples directory. If this issue persists, let me know. Thank you! \n. Ah... nice. Thank you! I made the change and it will be in today's release.\n. The SideNavigationViewController only needs to exist as the rootViewController, or a child of another UIViewController. Is it possible to go about it that way? Can you let me know more about your app to better help you? \n. Checkout Navigation Controllers. This should help in your understanding. This weekend we will be writing more documentation on Navigation Controller features.\n. I haven't heard from you, so please reopen or create a new issue if you have any further questions. Thank you! \n. Yes, there are a couple things. \nThe MenuViewController has its own mainViewController, so the transitionFromMainViewController is calling it on self, which is referencing the MenuViewController. That is why the entire view controller is being replaced, including the NavigationBarView.\nTo reference the NavigationBarViewController, which is the mainViewController for the MenuViewController, you would want to do this\nswift\n(mainViewController as? NavigationBarViewController)?.transitionFromMainViewController(InboxViewController() ...)\nThat will preserve the NavigationBarView.\nIf you want to have a modal UIViewController, you can set the floatingViewController property for the NavigationBarViewController, like so:\nswift\n(mainViewController as? NavigationBarViewController)?.floatingViewController = InboxViewController()\nTo close the floatingViewController, set in the InboxViewController a button that triggers this line of code:\nswift\nnavigationBarViewController?.floatingViewController = nil\nI need to write some documentation on this. Something we are doing. Generally, the different Navigation Controllers can be stacked in any order to change how everything moves around. In the Examples/App project, the AppDelegate shows a configuration of stacking Navigation Controllers. Easily, the MenuViewController and NavigationViewControllers can switch parent child relationships. \nIn the Examples/App, there is code that demonstrates using the floatingViewController code when opening the SearchBarViewController.\nI hope this helps. \n. Checkout Navigation Controllers for more information. This weekend I will be spending time writing up documentation on Navigation Controllers. \n. I am closing this issue. If you need, please reopen, or create a new issue. \nAll the best! \n. You can set the value like this.\nswift\nsearchBarView.textField.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.green.base\nThat should work. If you have any further issues, reopen or create a new issue. \nThank you!\n. When you build the framework, build it on Generic device or device. Embedded frameworks won't work unless that is done. Then when you build the project you want to run, you can choose a simulator or device. \n. @mohpor You are probably right, but in this instance, @misbell I noticed in your video you are not building the framework on Generic Device, or a device, it is being built on the simulator. Try building the framework on Generic Device, and then when choosing to build the App, use simulator. \n. \n. @mohpor @chaitanya-ramji Thanks for your help.\n@misbell Happy to help :) \n. Thank you! I am already making the fix for shadows. It will be out later today. @misbell The community around this project is incredible, that is what makes it happen. \n. This should be fixed now in 1.34.7. Thanks for this. \n. Hmmm.... I ran the project now and didn't have the error. Could you share more about your setup?\n. I am looking into this today. If needed, a join.me session sounds good. \n. Can you try 1.34.9 and see if the issue persists? \n. I haven't been able to reproduce this issue. If you continue to have the issue, please reopen the ticket, or create a new one. All the best :)\n. Hi @transat \nWhen making a UITableView with Material, the only difference is using a MaterialTableViewCell rather than a UITableViewCell. Here is a complete example in code, which is taken from the example App project. If you need any further help, please reopen this issue or create a new one. Thank you!\n. This is excellent, but should be added to development. Would you mind resubmitting it?\n. Yes, was merged :) Thank you!\n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Feb 28, 2016, at 11:26 AM, Nam Nguyen - \u30ca\u30e0 notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi Daniel, I just created a new pull request based on development.

As early as this week, and no later than Monday. \n. Hey, sorry for the delay on this component. I will put this at the top of the list for new components for this week. If it is not out by Friday, then I will have a better estimate of the time it will be available. \n. Try before you run the animation to use the cardView.layoutIfNeeded() method, as your coordinates may not be updated yet, since you are using AutoLayout. \n\nswift\ncardView.layoutIfNeeded()\ncardView.animate(MaterialAnimation.translateY(200))\n. I haven't heard back from you. If you need any further help, please reopen the issue, or create a new one. Thank you! \n. Fixed the issue :) Now making tests for the animations to confirm everything. Today's release will have this update. \n. Please checkout version 1.35.3 :)\n. I will look into this :) Thank you. . @Matungos  cardView.layoutIfNeeded() this is called in Layout if you are using it. So no need. Can you provide a sample for me to test against. Because I had made a test and all worked fine. Thank you!. @Matungos Thank you, I will take a look. . Looking now :). I confirmed an issue, I will be working on this today. Thank you :). A proposed fix is now in development. I will need to test this more. If you can too that would be great :) @Matungos. I don't see a clear button. Can you send me a sample?. The button spans to more than the x, you can see this by setting a background. I think this is what you are seeing. . I am going to close this issue and prepare it for release :) Thank you!. Ah I understand. I Don't see how that could really be a Material thing as Material uses the standard UIButton and target handling. There isn't any special hit target setup. If you would like to send a sample over, you are welcome to. In order to help you, I need a reproducible sample. Also, if you are using a SearchBarController, it is not possible to have the Bar actually under the other. The way it is designed, is that it cuts the portion not seen off, so it is not actually under. They are beside each other. In order to have it under, you would need to set the display property to .full.  Send a sample to support@cosmicmind.com and if you would like to continue the discussion, use Material Gitter :) . The fix is now available in Material 2.4.1 :) Thank you for sharing the issue :) . Hi @GreyEcologist, \nYour issue is interesting, because even though you are creating a new node each time, you are only setting the delegate after the creation of the node where you set the value. I am going to run a few tests and see if there is a regression issue with some of the latest updates we made. \nAs a side note, you would see a gain in performance if you did not create a new ASCellNode each time, and then updated the respective UI elements. If you decide to go down that road, then I would suggest to remove the delegate when setting the MaterialSwitch, and then setting the delegate back, to avoid the call while updating the UI. \n. Nice, I will take a look as well. \n. So 1.34.6 onwards is the same code. The issue must have come up from 1.34.5 - 1.34.6. \nCan you share the code that updates the state of the MaterialSwitch, because I am not 100% convinced this is a regression issue. As it seems to work everywhere, and the Async UI is operating on its rules. \n. I'll run more tests tonight and confirm it is or not Material :) Otherwise push a fix.\n. The UITapGestureRecognizer sets a handler for when the user taps the MaterialSwitch. I am curious as to how that solves the problem, as you wouldn't have the \"handleTapped:\" method implemented. Did you implement that method?\n. That is my concern. I cannot apply a fix, if one is needed, as a tap gesture makes no sense to influence a scroll. And I don't know if you implemented the handleTapped method. At this point, I still don't see a fix, or an issue. I will continue investigating it, and hopefully it will make more sense. All the best! \n. Hmm... The confusion is, you reported a scrolling problem that caused the delegate to fire, and now the tap gesture is what fixes it. I am trying to make sense of it, so I can fix the issue if there is one. \n. So what should actually be happening, is the removal of the highlighted and selected properties. As those are internal for the UIControl to set. That should remove your issue. I am going to make a push with that, and if you can confirm it fixes it, then we are good :)\n. Your fix is in version 1.35.1. If the issue persists, reopen the issue or create a new one. Thank you for submitting this :)\n. We will have a fix for this tomorrow. Thank you for submitting this. \n. This has been confirmed and we will have a fix for later today. Thank you!\n. Try 1.35.1. If the issue persists, reopen the issue or create a new one. Thank you for submitting this issue.\n. The code looks to reference a navigationBarView. When I look at the SearchBarViewController, the code is not the same. What Material version are you using?\n. I believe it is because of the storyboard constraints, they are breaking with the height change that is being made in the layoutSubviews method. In the morning, we will look into this. Thank you.\n. That should work. Make sure in your storyboard you don't have an overriding value in the settings. \n. Thank you for this. Tomorrow we will look into this. \n. The height issue is most likely due to the NavigationBarView being a subclass of StatusBarView, which is used for views that are affected by the StatusBar. Can you try to use a ControlView. It has the left and right UIControl features, but doesn't have a set size. \n. We are working on Navigation and UIViewController updates. This will be addressed in those. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. All the best :) \n. Hi,\nThank you :) \nWe will put an example together. \n. Adding it as the rootViewController, and then disabling where and when you want to, is perfectly fine and recommended, rather than having it deep in the view hierarchy, since they are off screen animations that are meant to be global. \n. I am going to be working on a MaterialNavigationViewController so that you do not need to do work arounds and such. Their will be a recommended method of doing this.\nIf you don't mind, would you be able to share your code? Thank you! \n. In release 1.36.0, which will be done later today, this is fixed. We added support for the NavigationController and the example App demonstrates this. :) Thank you!\n. Yes that sounds great :) what kind of work do you like to do?\n. I think a great start would be to make some examples that help educate people on how to use Material. This would also help me see your Swift code :) \nAlso, let's move the conversation to Gitter, https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material\n. Nice! I am actually making a fix now to the NavigationBarView. Doesn't seem to be detecting the layout changes correctly. What version of Material are you using?\n. No, it shouldn't be an issue. It was some internal business I am fixing now. \n. Yes, that was an accident, to say this issue was completed. For this issue, I have a fix that I will implement in the morning. \n. Are you using storyboards?\n. Originally, I thought this was an issue with storyboards. Now I see this line:\nswift\nself.navigationBarView = [[NavigationBarView alloc] initWithTitleLabel: titleLabel detailLabel: detailLabel leftControls: nil rightControls: nil];\nI notice that your font size for the detailLabel is large, and should be size 12. Nothing looks incorrect from your example code, except that line. \n. Can you try setting the text for both titleLabel and detailLabel before constructing the NavigationBarView?\n. No, the NavigationBarView is created without any AutoLayouts. \n. Very strange, I cannot reproduce this. Can you try using the system font, and not San Fran?\n. Okay, clearly there is something going on here. It is late now, so I will work on this tomorrow. I am currently using Swift, so tomorrow, I will check with an Objective-C approach. \n. I made some updates that may resolve this in 1.35.3. I am not expecting it too. Over the weekend, I will be diving deeper into your issue and seeing what has happened. Thanks for your patience. \n. It is working now?\n. Sweet! Then I am closing this issue. Thank you! :)\n. Hmmm.... I am seeing 8.0 on my end. Is this on a new project you are making or an example one?\n. Please checkout version 1.35.3 :)\n. Why not use a NavigationBarView itself and that's it in your own viewController? What is in NavigationBarViewController that you want to use it?\n* Also, I fixed the Storyboard constraint issue with NavigationBarView in the example project. *\n. Your best bet is to use the NavigationBarView as a child view of a UIViewController, and then you won't have any issue with the mainViewController. That's what you mean right?\n. Great :) If you need an example of that, there is a NavigationBarView example project :) \n. Not 100% sure I understand what you are asking. May you elaborate? \n. Hmm... that is not how I have seen it done. I have only seen it that when you change the text, from the placeholder it appears. I don't think it would make sense to have the placeholder display the same value as the titleLabel when there is not any text. Am I missing something here, or is this a one-off need?\n. Well the idea is that we can improve on what has been done, not necessarily copy it verbatim. The goal of Material is to bring the look and feel in combination with Apple's concepts into one place. Not necessarily adhere to everything, as iOS is not Android. \n. Now I am missing something even more... lol :) The visuals I see only show the titleLabel when there is text. \n. Ah... Well then, now we got something. Yes, that is the spec. Okay, We should make the change then. \n. This is now fixed in 1.39.0. :) \n. Try setting the TextField detailLabelAutoHideEnabled property to false.\nswift\ntextField.detailLabelAutoHideEnabled = false\nIn the 1.34.* series, the auto hide flag for TextFields was added. The default is true.\n. :) Anytime\n. Can you send this to the  development branch. Thank you! \n. Thank you :)\n. This is a nice catch. We will update this in our next release. Thank you! \n. This seems to be an issue when using a CollectionView or TableView and not having a select item. \nAlso, CollectionViews and TableViews reuse cells, so sometimes, when scrolling fast the pulse is still animating while generating a new cell. This should be handled within in the CollectionView or TableView.\nPlease check if this issue still persists, and if so, reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. In the Examples Programmatic directory, the App project uses a UICollectionView as the mainViewController. That may help you. \nIf you share some code, I can further assist :)\n. Great! :)\n. - Please remove NavigationBarView and NavigationBarViewController and replace it with NavigationBar and NavigationController. \n. How did you get this issue? It is exhaustive.\n. This is neat. In order for me to include this, I would need to agree with the criteria of good and bad code. That would be something that would be difficult to maintain using something that I am not going to be on top of. Thank you!\n. Hey :) This has been fixed in 1.36.0. All the best!\n. Yes, this is coming up :)\n. Closing this for now as it will be coming out shortly. Basically once we workout the kinks with NavigationController, we will be adding the tabs as a separate and combined view. \n. Today, 1.36.0 will be released, which will solve this issue. \n. Nice, question. This should be a feature request, and we will make it happen. So let\u2019s leave this issue up. \n\nDaniel Dahan\nM: +1 647.627.0770\nSkype: djondahan\n\nOn Mar 10, 2016, at 3:51 PM, hisham2007 notifications@github.com wrote:\nsorry for asking many questions today. as I am assessing Material framework before starting our new project.

It is unclear to me. Thank you!\n\nIf you want to disable the rotation, that can be done in two places: first place, remove the ability for your application to rotate, in the project settings, or two, change the code in the example project to not handle rotations. \n. Hmmm... There are two rotations that happen in the camera. There is the rotation of the preview, which will adjust as you rotate your camera, and then there is the rotation of the view controller, which will adjust when you rotate the device. It sounds like you want to stop the rotation of the view controller. Is that correct?\n. That is weird, it looks like the photo is in the opposite direction from the perspective. That is an issue. Can you describe your setup and we can fix this. Thank you!\n. I am closing this issue as I cannot reproduce it and I have not heard from you. Please feel free to reopen this issue or create a new one. Thank you!\n. Yes! I found that issue as well. I will make a fix. Where did you place that line of code?\n. No worries, I have been meaning to revisit the entire capture view , so I will take this as a queue to do so :)\n. Hey! I will be looking at this tomorrow. Thank you and sorry for any delays. \n. Hey! I am working on Capture this week and weekend. So you should have the update soon, btw, I am updating everything for Swift 2.3 and 3.0 for Material 2. Just incase you are planning on how to integrate the new work. Also, what is Teplr? I am looking online?\n. Very cool :) looking forward to seeing it. @teplrguy\n. @AhmettKeskin Yeah no worries, I am happy you brought this up. So basically, there is an orientation issue when first loading. I will take a look at that as I am fixing all Capture issues first. I anticipate I should have something for you to use within the latest couple days. That said, all the updates I am doing are in the development branch. Once I isolate the issue, I will make a hotfix, or suggest the fix that you can make. \n. Hi @AhmettKeskin I haven't had a chance to suggest anything for you. Sorry about that. I am focusing on the updates for Material 2. I am going to move this issue to Material 2 development as I am completely updating the Capture logic and setup. \n. Yes, that is not a problem. \n. This is now fixed in 1.37.0, which I am preparing for release. The properties are Optional, and called: leftThreshold and rightThreshold. Note, that in order for them to work correctly, the width of the panels would need to be greater than the threshold, otherwise, they will always close. All the best :) \n. Thank you for this.

I will take a look at this later today. Thank you!\n. Please try 1.37.0, if the issue persists, reopen the issue, or create a new one. All the best!\n. Yes it is called Toolbar now with ToolbarController, and there is a NavigationBar with NavigationController :) So it shouldn't be too bad. \n. Okay, I will see if I can replicate your issue using your code. I think the issue is arising when you make the Toolbar a child of the pulseView. \n\nTo update the insets and padding.... \nusing toolbar.contentInset and toolbar.spacing. \nWhy make the Toolbar a child of the pulseView, and not a child of the ViewController?\n. Ah... okay. I am working on replicating the issue. As well, MaterialLayout may be a good solution here, as it automatically adjusts the views, as an idea. \n. Can you try adding to your layoutSubviews this line... \n``` objc\n-(void) layoutSubviews\n{\n    [super layoutSubviews];\nself.playerView.frame = self.bounds;\n\nself.toolbar.width = self.bounds.width;\n}\n```\nIn anyway I try it, it works for me. So the above is a test to see what happens. If that doesn't work, then there is clearly an issue that I will need to dive into. \n. Great :) as always let us know when there is an issue. All the best! \n. Sweet, will do. We are going to be writing tests for Material aside from the projects. Thank you! \n. It will be in the next release scheduled today. 1.36.1. I am cleaning up the tickets that are left. \n. Yes, we are rolling out our navigation controllers, which will lead to the Scroll techniques as they are combined. Should be out soon. \n. Maybe this has something to do with the info.plist values. Did you set the \"View controller-based status bar appearance\" to NO?\n. Awesome! \nAs for docs, we hired someone who will be working on that extensively, @prateeksan. If anything, keep the questions coming and we will continue to make the notes as we put our documentation together. \nIf you want to discuss helping further, message us at support@cosmicmind.io :) \n. Taking a look now. \n. Yes that does make a difference. The animation you are seeing is specific to the NavigationBar that is part of the NavigationController. \n. NavigationItem is the correct way to set nav items in iOS.\nNavigationBarView is a replica so it behaves differently.\nThere is also a standalone NavigationBar example that is a subclass of\nUINavigationBar.\nThis is all a part of an effort to built out our nav controls. Since they\nare all new, the API is being fleshed out.\n. Yes I found this bug last night. It is fixed for the release later today. :)\n. Will be in release 1.37.0, which I am testing and then releasing. \n. It's not broken. The titleLabel is affected by the controls, so it only aligns when in equal space. If you want an always centre alignment, use the title property. \nswift\nnavigationItem.title = \"My Title\"\n. Have you tried playing with the bottomBorderLayer and bottomBorderLayerDistance ? Good point on the thickness of the bottom border. I am going to link this issue 203\n. Cool, we will perfect it when we make the changes to 203. Awesome catch :)\n. This is now fixed in 1.39.0. Thank you for bringing this to our attention :)\n. To avoid the clear functionality that is added to the clearButton when set, you can add the button to the textField, then clear the handlers, and then add your own. When clearing, use the textField itself as the target reference. \n. Yes, that is perfect. I will link this to 203 as well. \n. In 1.39.0, which will be released shortly, there is a boolean flag clearButtonAutoHandleEnabled that when set to false disables the automatic handling for clearing the TextField text. Thank you and all the best!\n. I have added @IBInspectable and @IBDesignable where appropriate for the next release. The other reason that this is not working, because you are using the leftBarButtonItems and rightBarButtonItems. The Material NavigationController does not use this. They use leftControls and rightControls that build the (left/right)BarButtonItems for you. I will look into supporting the storyboard properties while I make the changes I am making on NavigationBar now. \n. In 1.37.0 you should be able to use the updates, which I am preparing for release now.\n. I am making changes to the nav bar for the next release. I meant to push it yesterday, but I found a few issues I would like to smooth out. Once my changes are done, I will test against this and see if all works. \n. I think the reason the button image may not be loading is because Cocoapods is not configured correctly to bring in the Assets bundle, located in Material. I am looking into this, but that would be my initial thought. The image you are loading in App, is actually using the icon from Material itself, MaterialIcon.arrowBack. I have added commonly used icons, as I go, to the Material Assets bundle. \n. Cool. This issue is really a bug with the configuration for cocoapods. \n. I am closing this issue and making another that accurately depicts the issue. Thank you! \n. This wasn't a bug. It was to allow the title text to be different from the placeholder text value. So reuse was not a consideration. The spec dictates that the title should be the same as the placeholder, so your PR works nicely :) Thank you!\n. Can you send this to development? Thank you!\n. Thank you :) \n. Yes, unless you have the \"ic_create_white\" image in your project, it won't appear. \nIf you update to 1.39.0 -- you can use this instead as an example: \nswift\nlet img1: UIImage? = MaterialIcon.add // or a custom pen icon, MaterialIcon.cm.pen\nlet btn3: FabButton = FabButton(frame: CGRectMake(175, 315, 64, 64))\nbtn3.setImage(img1, forState: .Normal)\nbtn3.setImage(img1, forState: .Highlighted)\nview.addSubview(btn3)\n. I think it is the bundle identifier. Give me a sec, I am making an update to 1.39.2\n. Alright, 1.39.3 works :) \n. @leelir \nWhat version of CocoaPods are you using?\n. @leelir  The version you are using (1.0.0.rc.2) is a release candidate, not the 0.39* version that is stable and released. I would downgrade to that version. This is probably because the image bundle handling in the 1_.rc._ version is handling bundles differently. \n. @mohpor Yes testing against it is an excellent idea. Supporting it with a production release we cannot do until it is fully released. \n. Yes, I will put a task on this. \n. @jamalzafer The issue was fixed in later versions. Please update to the latest, if that is not possible, make sure that you place the size constraints before the position constraints. All the best!. Hey! Sorry for the late handling on this. It is the next rework on the agenda. Thank you for your patience. \n. FYI, I will be solving these issues over the next couple days as I rewrite the TextView. Thank you for your patience. \n. They are. I have already started working on them. They should be all tackled by next week.\n. @RuslanPatyk Thank you! :) And thanks for bringing it to our attention. \n. I am closing this as the notes have been made for the rework. Thank you!\n. I am currently working on them, and they shouldn't be long.\n. You are not bothering me. I am finishing iCloud support for Graph tonight. Then I am going to work on Capture and Editor. Capture is for camera/video and Editor, is the TextView. So it should be soon. \n. I am going to look at this in the morning. Give it a fresh look. I am not opposed to your suggestion, mainly, I want to encourage a cohesive approach. \n. First, I really appreciate the effort on this PR. I agree that the default width was not accurate and needed to be updated. Based on Material Design's drawer spec:\n\nSide nav width: Equal to the screen width minus the height of the action bar. In the example shown this is 56dp from the right edge of the screen. The maximum width of the nav drawer is five times the standard increment (56dp on mobile and 64dp on tablet).\n\nI have defaulted the width to 280 for mobile, and 320 for tablet. Where I had issues with the PR is:\n1. Didn't follow coding style. \n2. The setLeftViewWidth and setRightViewWidth were not handled correctly with the change. \n3. I love the default, but I don't like the maximum width limitation - as someone will ask, can I set the width to more than 280 or 320. Defaults are nice, and specs are great, but hardcoded rules in this situation feels limiting. \nIn general, I want to follow the spec as much as possible. With that said, this is an iOS device and not Android, so there is some flexibility to adjust and cater to the iOS environment. This is not necessarily the best example of that, but it is a factor in the decisions we make as a community. \nOnce again, you are an active and a contributing member, and I really encourage you to challenge my decisions and be a part of this wonderful process as we make an awesome framework for everyone. \nVersion 1.37.2 has the updated default widths. \nAll the best :)\n. It is not a bug, it is a matter of opinion. You can easily set the instance property of the sideNavigationController.hideStatusBar = false. \nAt that point, you will have to handle the statusBar hiding. This is the default behaviour of iOS hiding the statusBar with a NavigationController. \nDo you have any suggestions?\n. @sohayb I am going to update this with a better solution. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I wasn't so pleased with it, though, I thought launching the NavigationController as is was a better overall approach. All the best! \n. In the latest release, this is fixed :) 1.38.0. Should be out soon. \n. Hello,\nThere are a few projects you can take a look at that will help you. By the \"menu thing\" are you meaning the floating button at the bottom right that pops-up a group of buttons?\nExample 1: This example uses the Menu controller. \nExample 2: This example uses a MenuView.\nExample 3: This example uses a MenuViewController.\nExample 4: This examples uses a MenuViewController in an example App project.\nIf you have any questions, please reopen or create a new issue. Looking at the example links should get you started very nicely. \nAll the best! \n. I am going to make an update that will avoid the setup. There are a few TextField tasks that are lined up and I will do them all at once. I will leave this up for now. Thank you for submitting this. \n. This is now fixed in 1.39.0. You no longer need to setup the titleLabel. :)\n. Try setting this to false shadowPathAutoSizeEnabled = false and then set your path. This way the code block won't have any effect. The last line, is actually to animate the shadowPath on transitions, when you want it to automatically adjust, otherwise, the shadowPath stays where positioned when the item moves. \n. Let me know if it works :)\n. Awesome, all the best!\n. Well the backing layer, self.layer is acting as a container for the visualLayer. The layer is holding the shadow path. If you append your content within the visualLayer, which has its mask set to true by default, you should be able to achieve what you are looking for. If I understand you correctly. For example... \ntry as an experiment:\nswift\ncell.visualLayer.addSublayer(myview.layer)\nSomething like this. This is my first thought. \n. Another option is to use a CardView, which has a child view, called detailView. You can add what you like to that, set it to clipBounds, and then apply the path to the CardView. You may need to apply it to the detailView as well. These suggestion have not been tested as I am about to sign-off for the night. If none of these suggestions work, I can work on one tomorrow.\nAll the best!\n. You don't need the masking layers now. You should be able to use the visualLayer and that's it. The path for the backing layer will automatically conform to the visualLayer. This is a general statement. I would try the process again with the visualLayer. Also, the approach you are taking is an advanced approach and an optimization. Like a hidden gem with what you can do. I am happy you found help here :) All the best! \n. The pulse effect is limited to the visualLayer, it is attached to that layer. Hopefully that helps. \n. Hey! Sorry about that. Please checkout 1.37.3, the issue should be resolved. \n. We are still adding support for Storyboards. Programmatically, this wouldn't be an issue. Over the course of the next few iterations, we will have more examples to aid in this. I will leave this issue up for now, as I experiment with a solution. \n. Hi, we launched 1.38.0 recently. I have still not been able to reproduce this issue. We will keep on trying. Please let me know if you have found a solution, or reopen this issue if the problem still persists. \nThank you and all the best. \n. Nice! I will review this tomorrow during the day. All the best and thank you!\n. I am going to be doing a lot of work on the TextField and TextView. This is a really great addition and I will massage it into my changes. Thanks :) \n. This is excellent! Would you mind sending this to the development branch? Thank you!\n. lol, awesome buddy :) Thank you!\n. Yeah, we will look into this :)\n. Ah... okay, that will be helpful. \n. What was it? \n. @GreyEcologist Hey, I am about to sign off, if you would like to try and fix this, that would be great. There are a bunch of issues, but they all relate in groupings, which will help when tackling them. The best bet to help tackle this issue, is to send a sample project illustrating the issue to support@cosmicmind.io. That would be much appreciated :)\n. @mohpor There is a project passed to support for this. I will forward it to you to review. \n. @mohpor nice. Yes, please make a PR to solve the issue and please make a card for reworking the menu in Trello :) Excellent work. \n. actually rather than return nil, if the function doesn't have a return type, use\nswift\nif !hidden {\n// do something\n}\n/// continues and ignores work.\nAlso no need for self, unless in a closure with unowned or weak\n. I am closing this issue as it will be released in the next release later tonight. Thank you @mohpor \n. Can you send a screen shot? Also, I am working on the BottomNavigationBar now, and tabs following. The last week has been spent on this framework AlgorithmJS, and now all our attention is on the latest updates from Apple, and latest MaterialDesign components :) I'd give it a couple days before they are fully fleshed out. \nAnd it is our pleasure to work on this :)\n. Nice view :) \nTo fix the line, set the depth of the toolbar to .None\n'''Swift \ntoolbar.depth = .None\n'''\n. Also I am launching the BottomNavigationBar tomorrow and tabs tomorrow as well most likely \n. Pretty much every view has the depth property. Generally, you are correct. We are working on bringing documentation to Material as we continue to rollout new technologies and features. All the best and keep the questions coming if you have any :)\n. Excellent! Latest Friday this will be resolved with the release of BottomNavigationBar and tabs. \n. This is coming out in an hour. \n. So you are using an older version, the latest is 1.37.3. The Toolbar replaced the NavigationBarView and now there is a NavigationBar and NavigationController, as well as, a ToolbarController. In the examples directory, you should be able to find many examples demonstrating these features. If you have any further questions, please reopen or create a new issue :) All the best! \n. Yes try that, and possibly set the version to at least 1.37.3 in the pod file. Not sure why it wouldn't update you to the latest. \n. Try setting the pod like so:\npod 'Material', '~> 1.37.3'\n. \n\nI did a fresh test project and install and all seemed to work. Possibly uninstall cocoapods and then reinstall it using the gem install cocoapods command.\n. I think that a ticket sent to CocoaPods would help. There could be an issue with the server distributing to your location. \n. Also, seems to exist http://cocoapods.org/?q=Material\n. Yes, if you are using CocoaPods, you can add the Material.framework to your workspace. \n1. Open your CocoaPods workspace. \n2. Add the Material project to your workspace by dragging it from the downloads folder, after you download it here.\n3. Then select the Material scheme and build for generic device. \n4. Go to your application project and click on the general tab. \n5. Click the \"+\" under the embed binaries section and add Material.framework to your project. \nThat should do it.  \n\n. Awesome! Enjoy :)\n. What version was this made from? There seems to be a lot of conflicts.\n. This is strange. This could be an issue with how CocoaPods handles bundles, and the added MaterialIcon library for icons that are bundled with Material. I'll look into this before I send out a release today. Thanks! \n. Hey, I released 1.38.0 now. Made a CocoaPods project and installed using Xcode 7.3. All seemed to work. If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new issue. All the best!\n. Try 1.38.5.\n. That is weird. I have created an empty project and installed the pods without an issue. I am going to be making another release today or tomorrow, so I will double check all corners to see if I can find anything. Sorry about that. \n. Nice catch :) Can you please send this to the development branch. \n. I'll do it right now, 1.38.1\n. It is live, thank you! \n. An immediate thought is to set the bottomNavigationController.delegate (UITabBarControllerDelegate) property, and implement the method:\n``` swift\nfunc tabBarController(tabBarController: UITabBarController, shouldSelectViewController viewController: UIViewController) -> Bool {\n        if viewController is PlaceholderViewController {\n            sideNavigationController?.openRightView()\n            return false\n        }\n        return true\n    }\n```\nNotice the PlaceholderViewController class check. You can add an instance of a PlaceholderViewController at the end of the BottomNavigationController viewControllers array. When detected, it will return false and execute the sideNavigationController?.openRightView() command, thus opening the right side nav panel, and returning false will stop the BottomNavigationController from opening the PlaceholderViewCotroller.\nThat should do it. There are other ways I am sure, and maybe more efficient. This is a good start. \n. You mean this?\n``` swift\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UITabBarControllerDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\nvar sideNavigationController: SideNavigationController!\n\n\nfunc application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n\n    let bottomNavigationController: BottomNavigationController = BottomNavigationController()\n    bottomNavigationController.viewControllers = [VideoViewController(), PlaceholderViewController()]\n    bottomNavigationController.delegate = self\n\n    sideNavigationController = SideNavigationController(rootViewController: bottomNavigationController, rightViewController: RightViewController())\n\n    window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = sideNavigationController\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n    return true\n}\n\nfunc tabBarController(tabBarController: UITabBarController, shouldSelectViewController viewController: UIViewController) -> Bool {\n    if viewController is PlaceholderViewController {\n        sideNavigationController.openRightView()\n        return false\n    }\n    return true\n}\n\n//...\n} \n```\n. If you need further help, reopen the issue, or create a new one :) You can also continue chatting on this thread. \n. Anytime :) \n. Would you be able to share  a sample project that causes these crashes and I can then use it as a test case to fix the issues from? I don't use Storyboards at all when developing, so my use cases are limited. \nI really appreciate your help on this. \n. Cool, I will look at this later today. \n. Thank you for this. I fixed it with:\nswift\npublic override init(frame: CGRect) {\n        trackLayer = MaterialLayer()\n        button = FabButton()\n        super.init(frame: frame)\n        prepareTrack()\n        prepareButton()\n        prepareSwitchSize(.Default)\n        prepareSwitchStyle(.LightContent)\n        prepareSwitchState(.Off)\n    }\nBasically the issue is when you implement IBDesignable, both the code and frame init methods need to be implemented. This will be out in the next release. Which I am doing tomorrow. Thank you!\n. Nice, I will look at this later today. FYI, I am planning a revamp on MaterialSwitch and TextField to give better customization and such. Thanks for this! \n. This is fixed and will be in tomorrow's release. Thank you for letting us know about this :)\n. These changes have been released. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.\n. How are you adding them after? Do you mean that you are adding them after you already add the BottomNavigationController to the view hierarchy?\n. Okay cool, I am fixing it now. Will be released in 1.38.2 :) \n. So, I am trying to reproduce this. Could you explain your setup?\n. I think though, I should put a check that there are at least two ViewControllers before returning an animation object. That will avoid the need for false. Thoughts?\n. generally we could do this:\nswift\npublic func tabBarController(tabBarController: UITabBarController, animationControllerForTransitionFromViewController fromVC: UIViewController, toViewController toVC: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\n        if nil == tabBarController.viewControllers || 2 > tabBarController.viewControllers?.count {\n            return nil\n        }\n        return .Fade == transitionAnimation ? BottomNavigationFadeAnimatedTransitioning() : nil\n    }\nThe transition will only be called when it is possible to transition. \n. Your's is actually more clear, but I think we can do this: \nswift\npublic func tabBarController(tabBarController: UITabBarController, animationControllerForTransitionFromViewController fromVC: UIViewController, toViewController toVC: UIViewController?) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\n    if nil == toVC {\n        return nil\n    }\n    return .Fade == transitionAnimation ? BottomNavigationFadeAnimatedTransitioning() : nil\n}\nI don't believe the transition method would be called if there wasn't a fromVC as seen in the method definition, Optionals are not passed. Try that, if it works.\n. Okay, submit a PR if you like, I can test further from there :)\n. You know what is really interesting, is that the method definition doesn't even offer optionals when auto-written by xcode: \nswift\npublic func tabBarController(tabBarController: UITabBarController, animationControllerForTransitionFromViewController fromVC: UIViewController, toViewController toVC: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning?\n. These changes have been released. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Let me know if this is an issue still. Thank you!\n. Would you mind sending this to development? Thank you!\n. Awesome! Thank you :)\n. Hey, Why a tableViewCell? Maybe a collectionViewCell would be better? Much easier to size, and layout. \n. I can do it tomorrow :) I am about to sign-off for the evening. \n. Yes I will be adding a demo for you later today. Are you in a rush?\n. What timezone are you in? My end of day is in 6 hours. Also, to ensure accuracy, if you can post a simple drawing of what you are hoping to achieve, that would speed things up.\n. Generally, if you can do this in the UITableViewCell and it is maintainable for you, I wouldn't veer from that approach. Especially if you have already coded it. I think your main concern was the display of the detailLabel, is that correct?\n. Yes a ScrollView was my thinking when I saw your view. \nThe next components in this order are, Paging Tabs, Snackbar, Scroll Techniques. \nSo why I was suggesting a CollectionView rather than a TableView was that it is easy to adjust the size of a CollectionViewCell over a TableViewCell, to make room for the detailLabel. \nI will think about this over the course of the day. I don't think that you need me to code the whole thing, and that will be tough with my day today, but I am open to play and experiment with an approach. Cool?\n. Cool, I will try my best :)\n. Hey! Is there still time for this? \n. Hey,\nYes, checkout the development branch, and look in the Examples directory for the MaterialCollectionView example project. \nThis should get you started. If you need further help, reopen or create a new issue. \n. Hey, anytime. \nWhy doesn't it support Material TextField? TextField is subclassed from UITextField, so all properties should hold true.\nIf not, you can store an array of TextFields and when the user clicks on the Return key, you can check if there is another TextField following the one just clicked in the array. Then you can set becomeFirstResponder to that TextField. That would be the premise of a solution. \n. I will take a look at this, thank you! :)\n. So it looks like the solution to your issue, you need to remove the animated: true value to animated: false. I looked all over the internet and found that the issue was a bug, and then not, and then was. If you remove the animation, all is good. I suspect this has to do with triggering the transition mechanism, and when animated is false, it sets the controller and moves along. Can you verify this and then close the issue? \nThank you!\n. I am closing this issue as it has been resolved. Please reopen or create a new issue if this persists. All the best :) \n. I don't recall anytime that there was a force unwrap. In general, setting up the delegate, requires that you do so when the relationship of the ViewControllers are set. What I mean is, if you create a ViewController, MyViewController() then set it to the SideNavigationController, the sideNavigationController Optional is not available in the viewDidLoad. That is because the viewDidLoad before the relationship was set. It should be setup in the viewWillAppear method. Do you mind sharing your setup code?\n. Can you share the code you are using to setup the FlatButton? This may be an issue with scale size. \n. Hmmmm... do you mind sharing your subclass, and why the subclass?\n. I am closing this issue. Please reopen or create a new one if you need any further help. \n. The shadow slightly spreads, due to the scale effect. I believe you could add an animation by subclassing the pulse view and adding animations to the touch handlers that spreads the shadow, and contracts it. I am not going to make this a priority right now, but we are planning some nice additions with 3D touch and such, and that is when this issue will be considered at a high priority.\nFeel free to continue the dialog on this, though for cleanup reasons, I will close the issue. \n. Thank you for helping us grow :) I think your suggestion would be a wonderful addition and many people would love it. That said, I can't say it will come out in our next release, as we are working on TabBars, but I can see it being available very soon. An app that we are making would benefit greatly from this feature. I am going to leave this issue up for now, as we will inform you and create a thread on this topic. \n. I added this to the upcoming list. Thank you!\n. @mortenholmgaard nothing yet.. Yes, check the App example. It has the NavigationController in there, which will show you how to use it effectively in a more elaborate app. \n. I see. What was the error?\n. This is because in order to use the NavigationBar, which is the subclass of UINavigationBar in the Material NavigationController class, the initialize that needs to be used is the initializer with the rootViewController property. I don't think Storyboards would be calling that initializer. Let me see if I can make it work :)\n. No worries :) \nSo the issue is, you need to set the UINavigationBar class to NavigationBar. That will fix your issue. I added an example project to Storyboards showing how to do this. \nNavigationController Storyboard Example\n. You mean the circle look for the buttons? Yeah, I think it would be cool to move things to an enum, and then be able to grow the effects for pulse. Nice suggestion. I'll leave this issue up, and will roll something out very soon. \n. I will look into it :) \nAs for the opacity, you could set the pulseOpacity, so you know. \n. Yeah, when I rework the pulse, I will see what can be done. Any suggestions?\n. @colinmorelli nice. Yes that is primarily why I want it redone. To make it crisp. Excellent suggestion. \n. @RuslanPatyk Hi, I rewrote the pulse animation, to match this spec, the surface reaction and Material response. I am going to add an enum handler to set the different states. I will close this for now, and once the release is out, please test. Sorry, if this is closed early in your opinion, this is mainly to coordinate with what I have in development pending release. \n. @colinmorelli I definitely agree about the scaling and have made some changes. I will be adding a new type of scale, or correcting it based on the scaleFactor, which was not set. Thank you! \n. Hey, yes we are working on. Should be out shortly :)\n. Let me look into it. There are TextField related issues that I will do in one swoop. I'll give you clear insight once I look into them later today. \n. This was an issue that arose when the bottomLayer color handling was introduced. I fixed it in 1.39.0. Sorry for the delay on this. \n. At the current moment they are a fixed size. In the next release, I will make it that you can customize it. \n. This is going to be fixed in a separate release from 1.39.0. Should follow really quickly. Thanks for your patience. \n. I am going to do your fix tomorrow. It is 4 am here, so I am tidying up the last fix. Sorry, but your fix requires some reworking I need to be fully awake for :)\n. :) Thank you!\n. This is now fixed in the issue-366 branch. I am going to close this and in the next release it will be available. \n. Most likely you are executing the prepareView method in the viewDidLoad method of the ViewController that is the rootViewController of the ToolbarController. At that point, the dimensions of the ViewController will be the screen, as the viewDidLoad method is executed prior to the relationship being made with the ToolbarController. To avoid this issue, use the viewDidAppear method:\n``` swift\nclass YellowViewController: UIViewController {\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n}\n\noverride func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    prepareView()\n}\n\n/// Prepares view.\nprivate func prepareView() {\n    view.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.yellow.base\n\n\n    let summary = UIView()\n    summary.grid.columns = 4\n    summary.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.grey.darken3\n\n    let items = UIView()\n    items.grid.columns = 8\n    items.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.grey.base\n\n    view.addSubview(summary)\n    view.addSubview(items)\n\n    view.grid.contentInsetPreset = .Square3\n    view.grid.spacingPreset = .Spacing3\n\n//      view.grid.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(16, 16, 64+16, 16)\n    view.grid.views = [summary, items]\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis should solve your issue. \n. Hey, \nWhen I tried your solution in an app without CocoaPods it broke and could not find the bundle. We would need to think of another solution. \n. I would like to solve this issue. So I am going to leave this up and we can work on it, or I will update you when I have come to a resolution. I will aim for this weekend to have a solution. \n. This has been resolved in 1.38.5. The fix is to check if the bundle can be found using the CocoaPods approach, and if not, use the default bundle location. \n. I think that the issue is the userInteractionEnabled flag is being set to false during the statusBar hide animation. It is not necessary to combine that functionality. I removed it in 1.38.5. Please reopen or create a new issue if this persists. \nAs for apps by CosmicMind, we are working on one to release :) \n. Hey! Thank you. \nI will look into this. \n. Hi there, if you checkout the example project in release 1.39.6 I added helpers to SideNavigationController to allow for different animations to be used. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. All the best!\n. Yes, I will put these in the upcoming list. Thank you!\n. Yeah, let's do it together :) Send me a PR, questions, whatever you need. Once you have something, I can add my input and help integrate it into Material. \n. Yes, using the reloadLayout method is the correct approach :)\n. No, I will add them. Thank you!\n. Do you mind trying 1.39.0? If the issue persists, reopen the issue, or create a new one. Thank you!\n. I am going to include both, the CosmicMind ones and the Google ones. I'll be doing a release later tonight with some updates, and those will be included. \n. This is now fixed, and will be in release 1.39.0, that will come out later tonight. Thank you!\n. Yeah, that would be great! Please send the PR to development, and please in the MaterialIcon file, add the values alphabetically. Makes everything so much easier to maintain. We are adding more icons today as well. \nThank you!\n. The SideNavigationController doesn't present a ViewController, it transitions the rootViewController. This means that rather than adding a new ViewController to the view hierarchy, it swaps one out for another. So the dismiss method wouldn't work as it doesn't have a ViewController available. \nYou have two options... \n1. Transition back to the original ViewController, using the same approach with transitionFromRootViewController. \n2. Preset the ViewController with normal methods available on a UIViewController, and then the dismiss will work accordingly. \nIf you need any further help, we are here :) \n. Thank you! I will take a look :)\n. Well done :) we really appreciate this. \n. Nice! We will take a look at this later today :)\n. I will be releasing this update today. Going to go through the code now. Thank you!\n. Hey! \nAn update has been merged into development, thanks to @ramonvic. We are going to make a release today, which will include the additions made.\nAll the best! \n. 1.39.5 has been published, please try using the fonts now. As well, clear your DerivedData folder and clean your build folder.\nAll the  best and thank you @ramonvic :)\n. Thank you :)\n. This looks wonderful :) I will review it and merge it into development. Thank you!\n. Thank you :)\n. Awesome, thank you! We are planning to launch a Theme API, which would do what you are describing :)\n. Not sure why this was closed, I am going to reopen it and put it on the ToDo. Sorry about that. As for timing, it will be sooner than later. I have a few items that I want to tackle first. If you have any ideas on this, I'd be happy to learn about them. Thank you!. Cool, I will come up with something for this. I think it is a great idea to theme Material. . @OrkhanAlikhanov I fully agree. In Material Gitter we can discuss and then update this issue with our solution. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Yeah add it to the detailView property. That accepts anything that is derived from UIView :)\n. I'll look into it, might be an issue with animations firing on the same thread and disrupting each other. \n. I fixed this in the rewrite of the pulse animations. I am adding some documentation and will be making the release. You can check the development branch and App example project to confirm. I am closing this issue for clean up. Thank you!\n. I am unable to verify this. Maybe you need to set this value?\nswift\ntextField.detailLabelAutoHideEnabled = false\nPlease confirm, or possibly give step by step instructions to reproduce. I know above you did outline steps, but all seems to work for me. \n. So I am not able to reproduce this issue. If you can provide an example project or more guidance that would be great. Until then, I am going to close this issue. Please feel free to reopen or create a new one if the issue persists. \n. If you can provide me a working example project, I would love to solve this without work arounds. I still consider Material to be at the foundation stage, and I want that to be as solid as possible :)\n. Yes, I verified this issue and will be putting in a fix today with a release. Thank you!\n. This is now fixed in 1.39.7, thank you for bringing this to our attention :)\n. Hi @FateRiddle \nI will answer your questions with corresponding numbers:\n1. Material has added @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable throughout the code base. So you can see it in storyboards as best as Apple supports it.\n2. We have 3 layout mechanisms: Grid, MaterialLayout, and general alignment done by the components. \n3. You can drag and drop the UI component you like to storyboard, and then change the class name and module in the configuration panels. \n4. Components make their best attempt to fit everywhere.\nIf you have any further questions, please reopen or create a new issue. \n. Thank you for this. Things will change significantly. I plan to rewrite the TextView in preparation for additions we want to add down the road :) I will keep this up until the effort is complete as the steps you outlined are important. \n. This is actually not so much an issue but rather a suggestion as I write the new TextView. I have taken note of this and will put it into play as the new one comes out. Thank you!\n. What version are you running and on what device?\n. Okay, tomorrow morning I will look into it. Thank you. \n. cool :)\n. No worries :)\nThe TextField was recently updated, which actually removes all that setup. Checkout the storyboard examples to help get you started. There is a TextField example. \nOn the home page of the wiki, there is a setup lesson, which will help you setup the example projects. \nGive those a try, and feel free to ask more questions. All the best. \n. For question 2: You should choose the corresponding view. So if you want a button, you should choose UIButton, and if you want a CardView, you should choose a UIView. Choosing a UILabel and then setting it to CardView will cause issues. If you want to see the type of view you should choose for each item in Material, the easiest way is to look in the class files and see the class that the Material item inherits from. \nSorry if that sounds cryptic, but it is the most simple way I can put it. Aside from that, you are always welcome to ask questions and reach out to the Material community. They are really helpful. \nFor the viewDidLoad question, essentially that is a great place to setup code, but not always the most ideal in certain situations. I think you are on the right path :)\n. Yes you can :)\n. So this is fixed in the development branch. Thank you! I am going to close this for cleanup purposes, and later today there will be a release with the fix. \n. Excellent! Thank you. \n. Well I cannot really comment on beta software by CocoaPods. I ran the pod install using the stable version and all worked well. It seems in CocoaPods' new version they are eliminating the hackiness of bundles. When they are stable, we will support the 1.* release. For now, only their stable versions. All the best and feel free to reopen or create a new issue if you need help :)\n. Sweet :)\n. You could follow this lesson that will show you how to add the framework to a Workspace. CocoaPods uses a Workspace, so you can add it to that one. That is a way better approach than using Carthage. \n. Would you be able to provide an example of this? I added as a test another CardView to the example project and all seemed well. Thank you!\n. Hi, I updated the storyboard CardView example to use two CardViews in release 1.39.9. Hopefully this helps. If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you!\n. Do you mind sending me an example of this? \n. I haven't been able to reproduce this. If you can send a project that I can then use to reproduce this, it would be great. Until then, I will close this issue. Thank you! \n. No rush. I like to leave active issues up, so once you have a reproducible project, we can reopen this :)\n. So this was an interesting issue. The clearButton uses the clearButton property, obviously. The KVO value internally is _clearButton which actually creates an issue, since the original clearButton is no longer accessible. So the best solution, without causing weird naming, would be to update the image of the clearButton and remove the pulse animation. \nI am not in favor of changing the name of the clearButton as it will lose its intuitive nature. If you have any suggestions or further questions, please feel free to reopen or create a new issue.\n. Well by mimic, do you mean make it exactly what it is? We can discuss it prior to any effort being made? The idea of the clearButton is to create the appearance of Material Design, since the component is fully geared that way. If all it takes is an image update and no one is the wiser, what would extra logic add?\nMainly I want to understand the thinking here so we can come to the best solution. \n. Ah... Cool. We are planning on launching a really cool feature based on Theming which will essentially allow combinations and consistency with each platform. So much ahead and I appreciate your help in making things awesome. I will close this for now. \n. I can add some properties you can set that will enable this :)\n. This has been fixed and is in the development branch. I will be making a release later today.\n. Released :) 1.39.8\n. Did you set a borderWidth?\nswift\nv.borderWidth = 2\n// or\nv.borderWidthPreset = .Border2\n. oh... the lineLayer? \nThere are 4 color settings you can set: \n``` swift\n// The lineLayer color when inactive.\ntextField.lineLayerColor\n// The lineLayer active color.\ntextField.lineLayerActiveColor\n// The lineLayer detail color when inactive.\ntextField.lineLayerDetailColor\n// The lineLayer detail active color.\ntextField.lineLayerDetailActiveColor\n``\n. Hey :) Yes, we can update the example. I will do it later today, or latest tomorrow morning. \n. I am going to update this today :) \n. Please check [1.39.12](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/releases/tag/1.39.12), the Example/Programmatic/SideNavigationController project has been updated to demonstrate how to transition the rootViewController. If you need any help, reopen or create a new issue. All the best :)\n. Hey, can you share more about your setup? Also, if you want the height of the CardView and you are using AutoLayout, you should calllayoutIfNeededand then the height should be available to you. \n. Hi @HowardCsie I haven't heard from you, so I am going to assume your issue is resolved. One reason you may get the blurry effect is because you are using non-integral values for the button. If you are using AutoLayout, this could be because of a different issue. When you have the time, please show me the code you are using to create this and then I can help you further. Thank you!\n. Where is your code being loaded? Is this in a UIView or UIViewController? I noticed that you are using a property calledview, which would not be good in a UIViewController, since it may conflict with the UIViewControllerviewproperty. Other than that, your code looks fine. This leads me to believe it is in your Storyboards layout. What is the layout configuration of your button, cardview, and field?\n. I still don't see any issue. If you can send a sample project with this to support@cosmicmind.io, I will work on fixing it. \n. @HowardCsie So in your loginView, you need to set thecontentScaleFactor`.\nswift\nsubmitButton.contentScaleFactor = MaterialDevice.scale\nAlso, if you do not want the shadow to be displayed, set the depth to .None, rather than setting the shadowColor to MaterialColor.clear.\nswift\nsubmitButton.depth = .None\nAnd that should fix your issue. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue :) \n. This is a weird issue with Apple's approach to hiding the statusBar. I have been playing with ways to make it work, and so far the only way is using the menuViewController as you stated above. I will leave this issue up and see if I can come up with a better approach. \n. @levuhai In the example project, I eliminate this issue, by using a view hierarchy that you can see in the AppDelegate, App example project in the programmatic directory. The issue is, Apple detects the NavigationController at the point of contact to the edge of the screen, if that makes any sense, and then they decide to animate the statusBar to a hidden state. I will continue to see if I can make it easier to work with, rather than the hierarchy setting that has been the only successful and non cumbersome approach. I plan to rewrite the NavigationController within the month of May. I am going to close this for now, as I have noted the issue and agree it should be resolved within the rewrite. Although, this is really how Apple handles the situation, so technically, it is not an error or bug. \n. Excellent! Thank :)\n. Nice, yes I wanted to visit this again to help in this issue 277. I am going to take a look at the titleView overlapping the rightButtons, it shouldn't. That would be a bug, possibly a regression.\n. Perfect! I would appreciate that very much :)\n. We can continue this issue within the PR. I am closing this for cleanup purposes. Thank you :)\n. This looks great :) I will go over it in the morning and merge it in. \n. @ramonvic Hey, I just realized that this is going to master. Can you send it as a PR to development? Thank you!\n. I'll close this and when you get a chance, please send it to development :) Otherwise, I looked it over and it looks great. \n. Hey! Sorry I didn't include this before. I am working it into the project now, as it required quite the update. I also revamped the NavigationBar. Once again, thank you!\n. Hey,\nAre you testing against a view that does not have a transparent background? The lag may be due to the animation from the right taking place, but you are not seeing it since that VC exampleLoadViewController does not have a background. \n. Try adding one, because I don't see it in the animation you sent me. \n. If you would like to package an example project and send it to support@cosmicmind.io we may be able to help. All the best :)\n. Do you have a background color set on the view controller you are pushing? \n. Good catch. I will add this to the release later today. Thank you!\n. As always, I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. It is now fixed in 1.39.13 :)\n. Sorry, I didn't see that you would submit a PR. \n. In the original fix I went with your recommendation. I think that a rethink in some aspect of the TextField would be a good idea. Tomorrow I can work on it as I continue my work on the TextView. Either way there will be a fix, but I don't want to push one tonight and then not be around for the next 12 hours. If you can think of an approach that would be great too. \n. I'll be posting a solution later today with a couple of other issues fixed :)\n. I'll have a better idea of my solution in a couple hours when I am in front of my computer. All the suggestions though are good, as they are pointing out edge cases that still exist. I'll probably rework the internals to handle this more appropriately than introduce a quick fix. \n. @riteshtechno Yes, almost done. Will be out later today. Thank you! :)\n. @riteshtechno and for those who are monitoring this issue. I am testing the solution I would like to push. Should be done momentarily. \n. Hey guys, please try 1.39.14. Thank you!\n. @riteshtechno The color issue is a new issue, and in general that would be a simple fix. If you open an issue with an example where it is breaking, or a suggested PR with the updated code from 1.39.14, we can release a new update. \n. Yeah, I will add it to upcoming :)\n. I plan to implement the upcoming list within the next couple weeks. \n. Its unfortunately still in the queue. I'd be happy to work on it with you. \n. In the UIViewControllers you do not want the SideNav to be enabled, set the enabled flag to false. It works best to set it in the viewWillAppear method. \nswift\noverride func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n    sideNavigationController?.enabled = false\n}\nAll the best and please reopen or create a new issue you need more help :)\n. Yes, I noticed this too, when you pan downward it actually triggers the SideNav to move. I would like to fix this today. I'll update you shortly. \n. @hvbnet Please try version 1.40.0. If the issue persists, please reopen the issue, or create a new one. Thank you!\n. You can set the leftViewWidth and rightViewWidth through the setLeftView and setRightView functions. The reason for this, is because of the management of internal values that follow. If you need further help, please reopen or create a new issue. Also, if you can suggest why you need those to be public setters, that would be great. \n. I will be revisiting the pan gestures later today. Let me see what is possible :)\n. @xaviermawet Please try 1.40.0 and let me know if the issue is fixed. I am closing the issue for now, please reopen or create a new one if the issue persists. \n. @havocked awesome. Yes I lowered it so it wouldn't be so far out. Maybe it is too little. To adjust the value, you can set rightThreshold, and leftThreshold on the SideNavigationController instance. \nswift\noverride func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewWillAppear(animated)\nsideNavigationController?.leftThreshold = 64\nsideNavigationController?.rightThreshold = 64\n}\nIf you find a better value to use as the default, please let me know. \n. Sounds good. I will take a look later today.\n. Well first I need to verify the difference in shadowing and if it would look good, etc. I will probably need to make another update on the TextField today, so I will update this issue at the time as your other one, 332 :)\n. Hi @saipnc I updated the depths in 1.39.17 to give a better balance of the shadows. You as well can customize it further if you like. I added a MaterialDepth example project in the Programmatic directory if you would like to test it out. \n\n. Nice! If you can send this to development, that would be great! Thank you :)\n. Awesome! Thank you.\n. There is a pulse(point: CGPoint) function, that you can use. The default is the center if no point is passed. Give that a try. . Ah I see, you want it to be connected to the actual tap and not fire it off programmatically. Yes, set the pulseAnimation property to one of the following: \nswift\npublic enum PulseAnimation: Int {\n    case none\n    case center\n    case centerWithBacking\n    case centerRadialBeyondBounds\n    case radialBeyondBounds\n    case backing\n    case point\n    case pointWithBacking\n}. Anytime :). Hi, you can find an example of using the MaterialTableViewCell in the App example project. I am working on new documentation, so finding resources will be easier. Please feel free to reopen or create a new issue if you need any help. All the best!\n. Nice, can you please send this to development? Thank you!\n. I'll add it to the Upcoming. Thank you!\n. Awesome thank you! I will update the others like this if any. \n. Thank you :)\n. I am going to verify, as my tests returned different results. Thank you!\n. @saipnc When you say the titleLabel doesn't come back, are you still focused on the TextField?\n. @TonyStarkk  Can you confirm what version you are using, Material 1.39.15?\n. Do you mind sharing your code setup? I tried a few devices and I can't reproduce the issue. Thank you!\n. @TonyStarkk I think this has to do with the internal setup of the titleLabel not having a frame size. Which is causing it to not display. \n. Are you using AutoLayout to layout your views?\n. If I pushed a change to development, would you be able to try it? Or if I gave you a line of code to change, would you be able to do that?\n. Please try development.\n. yes, please\n. Are you using CocoaPods to get the package?\n. Okay, give me a sec, I will make a CocoaPods installation and do the test. \n. no worries, it is a pleasure :)\n. Okay, all works for me. Which, now makes this more interesting. Would you be able to send me a sample project, or the one you have and I can see what the issue is?\n. Yes, @ support@cosmicmind.io\n. @saipnc Yes, there was a regression. I am working to fix this. It seems this is only in certain cases. Can you explain your setup, are you using AutoLayout, etc... ?\n. Yes, I received it now :) Thank you. I will look into this. \n. Yes if you don't mind, please send to support@cosmicmind.io The issue is related to AutoLayout in some setups. Thanks!\n. @TonyStarkk I think the source files were stripped when sending the files. \n\nLooking in the directory, none of the files are there. \n. @saipnc thank you\n. @saipnc I have your project working now. One last case to handle, clearing the text programmatically. \n. Please try 1.39.16. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you very much for helping with this @TonyStarkk @saipnc \n. Yes this was an issue and not it should be fixed in 1.39.17. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. \n. I like your proposal and will be working on the TextField today. I will take your other suggestion 336 into consideration while working on this. \n. @zgosalvez Test this with the new TextField, temporary name MTextField in development. Please add any concerns to this issue 342. Thank you!\n. Yes, the crash is that their is a nil value. Are you setting the Module to Material when using the TextField? Not sure why you are marking out the text, makes it harder to diagnose. \n. When you set a class name, you have to set the module name to where the class lives. Try setting the module name to Material. \n. Can you show me the setup of the TextField? \n. I see that the example in MaterialCollectionView was off, which is the only example I found that was not updated for the latest changes to TextField. You shouldn't have to setup the UILabel for the titleLabel or the detailLabel. I have updated the example code, and will push the change later today. If you are using an earlier version of Material than the latest, then you may see code that shows you to setup the TextField labels, which is no longer needed. \n. All the best :)\n. This looks good. I will see if I can integrate it into the TextField. I am sure more people would appreciate this :)\n. Yes, I tested this out and really like. I am working on a documentation page with the updates I am making. Basically every component in Material will be revised with the latest specs from Google, with documentation on our site. I really appreciate this help. Thank you!\n. @zgosalvez You can now do this in the new TextField, temporary name MTextField, which is now in development. Please track any changes prior to release here 342. To override the frame, subclass and override this function layoutClearFlatButton. I am closing this issue to consolidate all TextField issues in 342.\n. The pulseFocus doesn't ripple, it stops the pulse once the touch is done. Hence the focus part, it only exists when focused. Can you confirm this?\n. Yeah, it should pulseFocus, and then ripple out. This is a really important one, since Pulse is used everywhere. We must get it right :)\n. I resolved this in the new rewrite of the pulse animation. It is currently in development and I will push the fix tonight. Thank you!\n. Can elaborate on what is the weird side effects?\n. Are you setting a placeholder? I will try now. \n. This is a confirmed bug. I will fix it today.\n. Yeah that would cause an issue. I am working on documentation for this release today with a fix. \n. @mohpor @saipnc @zgosalvez Hi, I rewrote the TextField, under the temporary class MTextField and added an example of its usage in the Programmatic/TextField example project. My aim is to simplify the interface and have a cleaner code base going forward. @zgosalvez I have spent quite a bit of time making sure that it follows the spec as best as iOS can. There is a little more work to do, not much and then I can release it. I was hoping you guys would be able to take a look. I have also been working on a documentation site, which I will push later today. \nThings to note: \n- I have removed the default clearButton - found that conflicted with the iOS clearButton. \n- I have simplified the API and want to keep it as minimal as possible. \n- I have rethought the entire approach of dealing with TextFields and input animations. \n- I need to add placeholder highlighting, formally known as title -> this should be an easy step. \nThanks guys, I will be finalizing this today, and then moving to AlertView, pulse animation, and SideNav.  \nThis is all in the development branch. \n. @saipnc @zgosalvez please take part in this issue.\n. @saipnc You can now do this in the new TextField, temporary name MTextField, which is now in development. Please track any changes prior to release here 342. I am closing this issue to consolidate all TextField issues in 342.\n. Hello, \nTry setting the pulseFocus property to true, otherwise, later today I will be working on the pulse animations in general to make them more like Google's. \n. Okay. I will leave this issue up as I work on the new pulse animations :) \n. Yes, I am working on a few things to be released today. My main goal today is to add the documentation for it. Basically, as I improve everything, I will be adding documentation to help in support.  \nSorry, for any hold up, but I think you will like what is coming :)\n. @MarkOnly Thank you :) I have pushed some code up today for TextField, for some people to test while I finish up the remaining work. Once that is done, I will be pushing the pulse animation updates. The last few days have been really busy, for the work here, and the work I do elsewhere. So today should be a good day of releases. I will keep you posted. \n. @MarkOnly I am going to be pushing it in about an hour, would you be free to test? 342\n. No worries, when you get a chance if you do :) After that push, I will be working on pulse, then sidenav. So maybe you will be able to test the pulse. \n. It will 100% not work, as the circle takes control of the width and height properties of the frame. I am almost done the TExtField, confirming a last animation. \n. @EdwardDing Yes that could be it :) The pulse animations need to be updated in general. \n. @MarkOnly Okay, now I see what you are looking to do, like Inbox. Okay I will make that one of my test cases, but in general, if you did make it a circle with pulseCenter = true, it may work. There may be a conflict with the sizing since part of the sizing is dependant on Apple in the NavBar. You could place with the spacing property as well to adjust the sizing, and the contentInset sizing. \nAs a workaround until I update the animations. \n. Shortly, I have a release to do with some other work I am part of, and they are in crunch mode, and that is why I have been slow on the issues coming in. \n. Try using a FabButton with pulseCenter = true and set the depth = .None\n. @EdwardDing thank you, @MarkOnly I will be available shortly, @EdwardDing looks like he knows how to handle this to fast track your solution. \n. @EdwardDing Sounds like an interesting idea actually in this case. Mind, you, I found if you size the buttons with the edgeInsets greater than 0, it will give some really weird stutter effect. So when you size the button, set those to UIEdgeInsetZero. \n. Today, sorry. Technically it is not broken, it is a rework in design. Like the TextField, it takes time.\n. Okay, can you write a list of all the pulse states we would need to handle?\n. I'll be working on this, feel free to join the conversation here: https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material\n. @MarkOnly So I got this working :) a whole new pulse. I am going to apply it everywhere and post it. \n. @MarkOnly I fixed this :) Thank you for bringing it to our attention. I will be adding an enum helper to make this a choice for animation. It is currently in development and will be released later tonight. I am closing this for clean up purposes, thank you!\n. I think a lot of people will benefit from this, so I will make it today with the updates I am making. I am working on the TextField, SideNav, Pulse, and AlertView to release today with documentation. I will leave this issue up until later today when I release the latest updates. \n. @mohpor You are wonderful. Let me get though today, and release the new docs style and work, and that will set the example I would like to have in place going forward. I also think we should put a roadmap together as a community and really take Material to the next level. I am dedicating May to making Material the iOS standard for Material Design. \n. Well then let's solidify that position :)\n. @FateRiddle Are you setting the Module to Material, after setting the class to FlatButton?\n. @FateRiddle You should see a field under the field where you specify the class value. See the screenshot attached. \n\nAlso, please refer to this example project to see this in a working example. \n. Hmmm... I am not sure of Carthage's limitations. Though, when I add the module, Material, I am using the setup from here, which is the least dependant method of setting up Material.  Did you try adding the module and running anyway? \n. As I have not heard from you, I am going to close this issue. If it continues to persist, please reopen the issue, create a new one, or join us on gitter: https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material\n. Excellent, I will make an update for this: _Placeholder And title label doesn't respect the text alignment of the TextField._\n. @mohpor In regards to the textAlign, the states as I see it are:\n- Align text in the alignment preferred. Placeholder should respect this. \n- When text is in the input field, the placeholder should animate to the same position as the text alignment. \n. @mohpor TextField latest documentation. This is where I will be posting the documentation for the reworked components as we progress through Material. \n. So the interface is kept simple at the moment so we can discuss it before release. The clearButton name actually conflicted with the internal clearButton private property. So it should be kept, with a more appropriate name. The sizes will be accessible in the end, once the defaults are confirmed. The colour changing will be added in a more appropriate way, rather than what was confusing in some cases. I'll be back at my computer in an hour to finish it up and release, which I will resubmit for testing to you guys. So this is a chance to get some much appreciated input in. \n. -21, the 21 value is the intrinsic size of the text field, which a size of 16 font, would be enclosed in. \n. If you use AutoLayout, it defaults to the intrinsic content size. So add a text field using autolayout, then call the layoutIfNeeded method and then call the intrinsicContentSize method, and print its value. \n. Could be more accurate, they both rely on autolayout, and the leading and trailing could affect it. This is why the new releases will go through the community process to ensure the best product :) I'll be working on the textfield in 20 mins, so feel free to add input. \n. Ah, the border would add 1px to height on top and bottom equaling 21. Could be the difference. I don't remember if I set that value. \n. Hey guys, I updated the TextField documentation and the MTextField. I only need to add the clearButton, and update the animation to adjust correctly with the alignment when different from .Left. That said, I have not seen the behavior of the animation anywhere for the alignment that @mohpor mentioned. Would you be able to state the different cases I should consider. Thank you!\nI pushed my latest changes to dev.\n. Let's say when you have textAlignment = .Center, the animation of the placeholder should move above and be as well equal to center. I am only confirming as it is the last piece and I couldn't find anywhere in Material Design spec this situation. \n. @mohpor We will make it work, I wanted to confirm the spec, that was it :) \n. I am going to support language detection. Working it out now @mohpor \n. I really want everyone to have as much flexibility as possible. That was actually one of the issues with the current TextField implementation. It was blocking the original clearButton and developers couldn't use it out of the box. So minimal additions to reach as close to the standard with the ability to continue the creativity. That's my thinking. \n. @mohpor So I have one last bit to add, which is rotation support. For RTL, I decided on the initial release of this component to support TextAlignment. As for RTL, I want to investigate it further with the different iOS versions to add a great solution with documentation. That can come on the next iteration. I think with supporting TextAlignment, .Left, .Center, .Right, people can offer RTL with a little effort in their app. Once I push the code, I will be going to sleep, and hopefully you can test the TextFields for any last modifications, before we release it. As well, to suggest anything in the documentation TextField, which mind you will grow as this is worked on more. The docs is really to set the tone of the type of documentation to come. \n. Yes, currently, divider takes the placeholderActiveColor value when the TextField is in focus. From my understanding, that is the MD concept. Any suggestions? \n. This is what it says currently, \"The divider defaults to black with an alpha of 0.12. When in focus, it is the same color as the placeholder focus color.\"\n. No worries. Keep note of these things. We can easily add an optional dividerActiveColor to override the default behavior, which will accommodate all needs. That should actually be the case. Also, a task to add the clearButton, but this time, I am going to add a boolean, which indicates, clearButtonModeExtended that allows for the clearButton to automatically be handled. This way the default clear is available, and the MD clearButton. The clear button is enabled with clearButtonMode, so the Extended is a logical progression. \nI am not married to the wording of the Extended, just an idea of the terminology. \n. okay, I am going to add rotation tomorrow with the final changes. I am burnt out. Have a good night, and I appreciate the help. Tomorrow this will be launched and then we can tackle the rest. Thanks again! \n. @mohpor I fixed the rotation, added a visibility button enabler, added a clear button enabler, without causing conflicts with the internal clearButton :)\nWant to test it out before release? I am going to document it tonight. \n. @mohpor Please pull from development again. I just updated it. As well, I am wrapping up the last part of documentation here, TextField. \n. Oh sorry, yes. Apologies for that. \n. This is now resolved and being prepared for release. Thank you!\n. Hi, sorry for any delay. The TextField is now released in 1.40.0. \n. @mitch10e At the current moment, the Toolbar only works with equal siding for both controls. You can use a clear button with no pulse to balance out the two sides. The toolbar is going to be updated shortly to handle the issue you are facing in a cleaner manner. \n. :) Amazing. Thank you!\n. @mitch10e Did you fix it?\n. Yes this was not fixed yet. It is coming up in the 2.0 branch I am working on. I am fixing a bunch up while cleaning up the code in that branch. You can see the changes as I go in development. For now, the solution is to balance it with a hidden button on the right. \n. Working on this today, so hopefully a fix will be in the development branch today or tomorrow. Thank you!\n. Hey! This has been fixed and is in the development branch. Please set the textAlignment property of either the titleLabel or detailLabel to center and the label should always maintain a centered state.\n. Are you using the MaterialTableViewCell, as well, are you using the SideNav?\n. Hi, as I have not heard from you, I am closing this issue. If this continues to persist, please let me know. I have double checked the TableViewCell code, and the userInteraction is all set to false\nswift\nimageView?.userInteractionEnabled = false\ntextLabel?.userInteractionEnabled = false\ndetailTextLabel?.userInteractionEnabled = false\nThe only interaction we added is the pulse animation, which has nothing to do with panning or any sort of gesturing. \nIf you need, send an example project to support@cosmicmind.io and we will see if we can help you. \nAll the best!\n. Welcome to Material :) \nDid you add the framework to embedded binaries?\n. When you built the framework, was it the iOS one? Can you send me a screen grab of your workspace so I can see all the moving parts?\n. I don't see anything wrong with your setup. If you can close your workspace, and open the Examples/Material workspace. Build Material, then go to a project and embed it and then run the project. See if that works. \n. Well as long as you are in a forward direction. Probably had to do with DerivedData and build directory conflicts. When you dragged in Material, it could of linked incorrectly. Either way, welcome and feel free to post an issue if you have any. \n. Hi, so I have recently rewrite the TextField and will be releasing it shortly with some additional changes, 342. Please join the discussion there :) I would like to discuss this more. \n. Put the enabled setting in the viewWillAppear method\n. Yes, the issue is that you were not setting the Vertical alignment. If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new issue. \nThank you! and @mohpor Thanks for the answer. \n. Yes that sounds correct. :) @mohpor \n. I am closing this issue. If you have any further issues, please reopen, or create a new one. Thank you!\n. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I fixed the issue by adding this line of code to the cell\nswift\ncell.separatorInset = UIEdgeInsetsZero\nIn the next release, this will already be set and you will not have to include it in your application. \nThank you!\n. I will take a look at this shortly :) Thank you! \n. So I think the issue is that the panGesture for the rightView and leftView are being set, even though they should not be unless you have a value for the rightView and leftView. I will fix this. You can test it, which I will release in 30 minutes. If the issue persists, we can approach the solution how you put forth. Thank you! \n. So the branch is now in conflict. Have you tried the latest? I will close this PR for now, until further notice and the conflicts are resolved. Thank you! :)\n. There are three different sizes, .Small, .Default, and .Large.\nswift\nlet c1: MaterialSwitch = MaterialSwitch(state: .Off, style: .LightContent, size: .Small)\nlet c2: MaterialSwitch = MaterialSwitch(state: .On, style: .LightContent) /* Default doesn't need to be set. */     \nlet c3: MaterialSwitch = MaterialSwitch(state: .Off, style: .LightContent, size: .Large)\nOtherwise, the customization of the MaterialSwitch is a little tricky. It will be rewritten soon, so if you have any suggestion, please send them this way. \n. Yes, I will add this type of feature while I rebuild the TextView :) Thank you!\n. I have taken this into consideration and will include it in the release of the TextView. Thank you! As it is not an issue, I will close it for now. I plan on the releasing the new TextView within the next 10 days. \n. Please try 1.40.1. I updated all the icons :)\n. I fixed this in 1.40.1, which I will be pushing within the next 30 minutes. \n. That is the correct solution. Use a container UIView and do what you like within it. Thank you @mohpor  :)\n. The approach you are about to take may or may not be effective. I am going to add a property that says to enable and disable both pan and tap. \n. Please try 1.40.1. I added enable booleans for all gestures. Thank you! :)\n. Can you send me your code setup?\n. Awesome! I will close this issue then. Thank you!\n. Are you asking how to switch the view from the SideNav, or the Tab?\n. I am about to head out and will be back in a couple hours. I will give you feedback on the easiest way to do it once I am back to my computer. \n. So the setup you should have is:\n1. Global SideNav, which wraps The BottomNavigation (TabBar)\n2. When you Tab between UIViewControllers in the Tab, rather than this:\nswift\nlet bottomNavigationController: BottomNavigationController = BottomNavigationController()\nbottomNavigationController.viewControllers = [VideoViewController(), PhotoViewController()]\ndo this:\nswift\nlet bottomNavigationController: BottomNavigationController = BottomNavigationController()\nbottomNavigationController.viewControllers = [NavigationController(rootViewController: VideoViewController()), NavigationController(rootViewController: PhotoViewController())]\nSo you are not tricking anything in this solution. If you are not using the internal NavigationController panning, you should use a Toolbar, and thus switch out the NavigationController(root...) code to ToolbarController(root...) code. \nMake sense? Or did I misunderstand your issue?\nAlso, for the MenuViewController code, you can wrap that around the Toolbar or NavBar, whichever you are using. \nMaterial uses a stacking approach to create complex Navigation relationships... so you can easily play with the ordering to achieve the flow you would like. \n. If you have any further issues, please let us know, or if you require more assistance on this issue, please let us know. Thank you!\n. Okay, in the morning I will help you out. It is late now and I am going to be sleeping soon. \n. Actually for this issue, let's move to Gitter. Add any details you like there, and in the morning I will take a look. I believe I know what you are looking for. \n. No worries :) we are here to help. \n. Can you share the error you are getting? \n. Can you try cleaning your build folder and derived data?\n. No just files left over in the caching of the build system. It happens in compiled systems here and there. Happy it worked :)\n. Hello, what version of CocoaPods are you using?\nWe have not updated Material for support for v1.0.* of CocoaPods. If you want immediate usage of Material, use 0.39.*.\n. No, CocoaPods 0.39.. They recently updated to 1.0.. Please continue to use Material 1.41.1 :) Also, checkout the App example for usage of the NavigationBar. Tonight I am signing off, but tomorrow I will share an example with you to better demonstrate its usage. \n. No worries :) If you follow this installation example, you wont need to wait for the CocoaPods update. \n. Excellent. I am going to be working on documentation all day and this weekend. This will help you out. We have undergone many updates, and the documentation is behind. \n. I think you would be on a great track to drop Interface Builder and look from the code perspective. It gives you unbelievable control and understanding. \n. I am going to close this, and let's continue the discussion on Gitter/CosmicMind/Material. I will be updating the docs. Thank you!\n. @Sreekanth1234 I believe you want to post your question to this repo https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios :) All the best!. @Sreekanth1234 okay, we are here if you need :). Excellent thank you! \n. I will take a look into this very soon. Thank you for submitting this. \n. Please submit more details. Until then, I will close this issue as we cannot reproduce it. Thank you!\n. This is a weird issue @urizev. It would result because the FabButtons frame is being altered to a square at one point. The flickering means it is struggling to maintain its shape. What AutoLayout constraints do you have on it from Storyboards?\n. Excellent I will take a look shortly. \n. Let's move this to Gitter for further discussion as it is not reproducible. Thank you! Gitter/CosmicMind/Material. \n. It is not an inconvenience at all. Thank you for bringing this to our attention :)\n. @marungos please share your setup code and what version of Material you are using. Thank you \n. @Matungos I am not seeing anything that looks incorrect. Would you be able to send an example project to support@cosmicmind.io ? Thank you!\n. I am going to close this, thank you @mohpor. @TheHmmka if the issue persists. Please let me know. I am updating docs during today and this week. Thank you!\n. There is nothing in the BottomNavigationController that executes the viewDidLoad method directly. This is interesting. How are you invoking MainViewController? Storyboards?\n. Can you confirm that this does not happen when you are not using the BottomNav?\n. I tried to reproduce it programmatically. I wasn't able to. This is probably a side-affect of the freeze dry principal with Storyboards. Do you mind sending me a sample project, to support@cosmicmind.io. I can take a look there. \n. Cool I will take a look. Thank you!\n. So if you comment out the code and do this\n``` swift\nfunc onButtonClicked(){\n\n//        let viewController: UIViewController = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"main\") as UIViewController\n    self.presentViewController(MainViewController(), animated: true, completion: nil)\n}\n\n```\nThe issue is gone. So my thinking is correct. Are familiar with how Storyboards are handled?\n. In the setup do,\nswift\nbottomNavigationController.tabBar.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.grey.darken4\nor if you subclass it, \ndo\nswift\ntabBar.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.grey.darken4\n. @teodorpenkov Are you facing a similar issue?. @teodorpenkov Can you confirm the issue happens in isolation? I would need to see your setup to further investigate. . @teodorpenkov The simple version is that when you create instance variables attached to views, storyboards store their state for later use. This could cause issues when combining storyboards and programmatic view controllers. I don't use storyboards, so I am not the best to elaborate on them. If there is a specific issue, I investigate it and go from there. . The reason you may not get the pulse is because all animations happen on the Main thread. This means that any UI that may occur could disable and block the pulse from actually happening. Are you having UI events occur after the button is clicked, or is it a simple notification and nothing else?\n. yes, comment out that code and see what happens. \n. Ahh... yes because the UI is being updated on that call. You can put a delay on the reload if you are wanting the pulse to go through. \nswift\nMaterialAnimation.delay(1) { [unowned self] in\nself.tableView.relaodData()\n}\nsomething like that.\n. I am going to close this issue. To discuss it further, we can use Gitter - Material.\n. @TheHmmka I have fixed the issue. Thank you @mohpor for the investigation :) Later today a release will be issued. \n. Should be fixed in 1.41.2. \n. Should be fixed 1.41.2 :)\n. The titleView is used to store all the values within the Toolbar. To set a custom view, use the contentView property. So it should be something like this:\nswift\nnavigationItem.contentView.addSubview(imageView)\n. Can you try the latest and tell me if this persists 1.41.2.\n. Yes I am working on the documentation. \n. The best way to view the documentation for now is through the example projects. During this week I will be updating the documentation at the http://cosmicmind.io/material website. If you have any questions, please open an issue or visit the Gitter/CosmicMind/Material page. All the best!\n. Nice catch. I will take a look at this in the morning. Thank you!\n. Can you try the latest and tell me if this persists 1.41.2.\n. Can you send me a sample project with this issue? to support@cosmicmind.io\n. Thank you @mohpor :) And the fix will be out latest tomorrow morning. \n. This is fixed in the latest release 1.41.3\n. Generally, this PR has a good structure and I am excited to discuss this and integrate it in. \n. I will need some more information to help you. First, what is the error? Is it this \"whose view is not in the window hierarchy!\", because that is not 100% clear. Can you paste the error from the console? Thank you!\n. Okay... so it sounds like you are missing a view in the hierarchy. Give me a bit, I will be able to help you. I am caught up in something right now  :)\n. Well tableVIew and UIViewController are iOS native elements. We haven't done anything to them. So your issue may be in iOS completely. If you have any other issues, please open a new issue. All the best.\n. Yes, please send the screenshots to support@cosmicmind.io. \n. Hey, as I haven't heard from you. I am going to close this issue. \n. Thank you for this, I will look into it :)\n. Excellent! Thank you @mohpor this is correct. \n. Thank you for this. I am going to look at it over the weekend before the next release.\n. This looks good I will accept it once I am ready to test, before the next release. Thank you! \n. I just realized this is PR to master. Would you be able to send this to development please? Thank you!\n. I am going to take the changes you made, and place them into development. In general, I would like for you to be seen as the contributor, which means you must send the PR to development. So next time, please do so :) \n. Hey! Yes you are correct. KVO needs to be added. For now, you can use layoutSubviews() after you update the text. We are still working on the Toolbar, so the next iteration should have a solution for this. Let me know if the issue persists, otherwise I will close this for now, and push a release shortly. \n. Hi, I appreciate this change, but the reference to weak is not because of the capture, it is actually because of the lack of capture. When an animation is interrupted or moved out, during or after when completion, we have seen issues where the self creates a bad access point. Please look at this issue that came up yesterday to this effect. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/399. Thank you :)\n. Would you mind sharing your setup code?\n. I think I am missing something. When I looked at your sample app, it was an incomplete copy of the example project. There isn't any code in the AppDelegate launching the application, as well, I don't see any setup in your Main.storyboard. Please try again, following the example project, if the problem still persists, feel free to reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. I believe the issue is the unowned self, this should be moved to a weak reference. Thank you, we will make the change. \n. This is now fixed in release 1.41.3, and is being release today. I will close this issue when it is released.\n. released 1.41.3\n. I have tested your example app that you shared in the link. It doesn't seem to be setup correctly. You are trying to use NavigationItems in a Toolbar. That won't work. Try following the example project in Storyboards, which shows how to use a Toolbar and Storyboards together. \n. This is now fixed in release 1.41.3, and is being release today. I will close this issue when it is released.\n. released 1.41.3\n. What version of CocoaPods are you fixing this for? Also, please send PRs to development. I am going to close this and you can resubmit. \n. Thank you!\n. This is solved in 1.41.5 thank you @mohpor :)\n. In the version you are using, the reason it crashes is because of the 'unowned' self. In the latest version, all references like that were switched to 'weak'. Please upgrade to the latest, and if the issue persists let us know. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. :)\n. Sounds good :)\n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. This is now in the development branch. PageTabBarController :)\n. Sounds good to me :) \n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. @aemgtz well essentially all icons passed to IconButton are custom. The button has no idea where the image comes from. As for the sizing, we use 24, 48, 72 for @1x, @2x, and @3x. \n. I am going to close this issue for now. I posted the sizes we use for buttons, and that should get you in the right direction. If you need any further help, please reopen or visit the Gitter channel. All the best! \n. Yeah, I will leave this up as I work on it. \n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. Cool :) There is an example project called ControlView that mimics the Snackbar. I think that a Snackbar component would be very handy. So we will keep this up as I make it. \n. @akhilm3 Yes, your suggestions are on track. The BarView which subclasses the ControlView offers all that you suggested with the mathematics to align everything built in :) I appreciate the ideas of how to approach the challenge. \n. I need to add a feature that allows global setup like you described. Then Material can offer themes. \n. Not long. We are tackling a big release for today. So, once that is done, it is all feature requests and documentation for me\n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. This is in the development branch now. For help in using it, please go to the Gitter page. I am posting documentation shortly. Thank you!\n. Are you trying to load a sample project?\n. So if you are adding the framework to the example projects, you need to build and embed the framework. This should give you help, Installation Tutorial. When you use CocoaPods, you will need the pod workspace open, otherwise it wont know where to find the framework. \n. It could be. I don't use CocoaPods, so I am not sure. Generally what you need to do is:\n1. Open the Material workspace found in the Examples directory.\n2. Build the framework for iOS with the Generic Devices set, not simulator. \n3. Go to the sample project you want to test. \n4. Embed Material in the Embed binaries tab. \n5. Run the sample project. \nThat should work. \n. You should be able to find more help here, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/wiki/Installation. \n. You should be able to solve the issue, if has not been already solved with the examples I directed you too. If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new issue. Thanks! \n. yes that could work. Give me a sec, let me see if I can do it now. \n. Question, as we are looking to make this change. Why do you need the setter to be internal? Since the layers are essentially public? Are you trying to add and remove layers?\n. Okay, I will be able to help you in the morning. \n. So we have been mulling this over and we are hesitant to make the change you are looking for. We don't get why you would want to suppress the touch event. Why not use a Tap Gesture for this, and leave the touches completely alone? The other option, and probably the best for you, is to subclass MaterialView and copy the minimal code used in the MaterialPulseView, to achieve what you want. You could literally copy and paste the code and omit what you don't want. \n. I am going to close this issue for now. If you would like to share some code and describe what you are trying to accomplish, we are happy to help. The Gitter channel is great for that. Thanks for sending this our way. \n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. wozers buddy :) \n. @mohpor I think you helped someone else with this recently, do you want to share a solution, or I can help out :)\n. @Elqul Hi, we have solved the problem and will make a release tomorrow, 1.42.0, with an example project. \n. Sorry about that. We discovered an issue with iOS, where the statusBar moves the entire NavigationBar up 20px. We didn't want to release until it was solved. So today we are working on it. Basically, your issue was because the NavigationController could not be detected by the window edges. This stopped the TabBar from being hidden. So it is all related in an interesting way. \n. Hi, sorry for the delay, please try 1.42.0 for a fix. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. @HowardCsie\nHave you tried the latest release in master ?\n. @HowardCsie exactly :)\n. hello :) are you talking about this, look to the bottom where it says toggle buttons. If not, can you show us. Thank you!\n. The tag has been added, and yes, I would prefer to leave this open so we can discuss further on this thread.\n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. Well I can't comment on beta xcode software, but what I can say, is try and follow these steps: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/wiki\n. Possibly, but that would be weird as I released an app two days ago, and am compiling and running the bleeding edge of Material. If you don't mind letting us know the result, that would be great! Thanks. \n. Yes I am. I stopped using Apple's beta software. I can't provide support to the mass on Xcode betas. \n. I don't either.. I develop with xcode.\n. Did this manage to work for you?\n. As I haven't heard from you, I am going to close this issue. If you have any further questions, please send them our way. Thank you!\n. Wonderful and no worries, so long as you are up and running :)\n. Yes documentation is being worked on this month. Have you had a chance to take a look at these example projects: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/tree/master/Examples. \n. Also, let's move this to Gitter. \n. No worries, for our discussion though, the channel is best. As this will create noise for watchers. \n. The next release is about updates to Layout and hiding the BottomNavigationController. This will be added soon though :) It has been asked for many times and finally I am getting time to do it. \n. Still in the queue. \n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. Hi, sorry for the delay, please try 1.42.0 for a fix. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. Sounds wonderful, we are here to help :)\n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. Hi :) \nWhat is shareView?\n. If he doesn't add SubView prior to using MaterialLayout, it will crash, because the view is not added to the hierarchy when trying to calculate the layouts. \n. @chashmeetsingh good point.\n. I s this with the latest changes? 1.41.8\n. There is a verified regression here. It shall be fixed. Thank you! \n. @chashmeetsingh that's because the call is incomplete. It needed to be updated. \n. Yes, but there is a regression here and it should be fixed. \nalso @chashmeetsingh this is the updated line \nswift\nview.layout.align.edges(containerView, top: 100, left: 20, right: 20)\n. This has been solved and will be fixed in the next release. I will leave the issue up until that release. Once again, thanks for bringing it to our attention. \n. Hi, sorry for the delay, please try 1.42.0 for a fix. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. Sorry, I don't fully get your question. You are asking about vertically aligning the buttons in the center position, and not be towards the bottom of the Toolbar? Do you mind sharing a drawing of what you are looking for.\n. yes, you can make that happen. Are you using a ToolbarController, or Toolbar?\n. Tomorrow, I will make an adjustment for you that will make this much easier. I am about to sign off for the night. \n. Where are you adding the image?\n. Sweet! I am going to document Grid in the next few days. That should help you, as Grid is the layout tool used in most of Material. Have you checked out Layout? A really easy AutoLayout tool. All the best!\n. Its black actually for a different purpose, and could be any color really. I could default it to white, I think that would be better. There needs to be a color though, because the statusBar hides in a different way now. Basically it updates window levels and goes behind the contentViewController. The previous statusBar hiding had too many cases where it wouldn't work if not setup in a specific configuration. I'll keep this issue up and write my findings. \n. Sweet, then I shall close this issue. Thank you!\n. Hi, \nYou could make a container view and add that to the cardView.contentView. That container view will be dynamically sized by the cardView. Within there you can do what you like. So sizing the label can be done however you please. \nLet me know if that works for you :)\n. Have you seen the cardView example project, and this snippet in particular?\n``` swift\nlet cardView: CardView = CardView()\n// Title label.\nlet titleLabel: UILabel = UILabel()\ntitleLabel.text = \"Welcome Back!\"\ntitleLabel.textColor = MaterialColor.blue.darken1\ntitleLabel.font = RobotoFont.mediumWithSize(20)\ncardView.titleLabel = titleLabel\n// Detail label.\nlet detailLabel: UILabel = UILabel()\ndetailLabel.text = \"It\u2019s been a while, have you read any new books lately?\"\ndetailLabel.numberOfLines = 0\ncardView.contentView = detailLabel\n```\nAlso, read up on this, Layout, which will make the layout system so much easier for you in iOS. \n. I think that part of the issue is in how you are adding the cardView. If you would like, send me a sample project to support@cosmicmind.io and I will see if I can help you from there. \n. Cool, I will close this issue then, and after you send it, follow up here on Gitter. Thanks :)\n. Hey, Please clean your build folder and delete your derived data. \n. What version of cocoapods are you running? If it is the latest, try cleaning your build folder and clearing derived data. We found that cocoapods had a caching issue with the latest 1.0. \n. You should update to the latest cocoapods and then clean your build folder and delete your derived data. Material supports the latest from CocoaPods. To update, you may be able to do it as easily as:\nsudo gem uninstall cocoapods\nsudo gem install cocoapods\n. I am closing this issue, if you find it continues to persist, please reopen or create a new issue. Also, joining Gitter is an easy way to get help :) \n. This is a specific need, especially with the naming you have chosen, Main and Left. So subclassing it and providing customizations is best, and the approach we hope people would take in these kind of situations. So is it working for you then?\n. I am closing this issue, if you would like, please send a project to support@cosmicmind.io and join the Gitter channel to discuss project specific help. All the best :) \n. The fix should be in 1.42.2. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. All the best :)\nAs for donations. I never really thought of that, so don't feel any pressure. If you did donate, I'd be happy with a cup of coffee :) The only way I can accept money at the current time is through paypal, with email: dahan.daniel@me.com. \n. set the detail value to nil, an empty string is still considered a string. This may be unintuitive. So it should consider that case as well.\n. The empty string case will be handled like having a nil value. I will close this issue when it is released later today. Thank you!\n. The fix should be in 1.42.2. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. All the best :)\n. Yeah, I looked into this. It is weird. It has to do with the animation in the transition. You could avoid it in two ways. \n1. Set the transition animation to duration 0. \n2. Use a ToolbarController. \nI will look into this further, generally, it is due to the animation of the frame size change in the NavigationBar. \nTo better discuss this issue if you like, use Gitter it is less noisy for watchers. \nAll the best :)\n. @nexelen this shouldn't be happening. What version of Material are you using?. Can you send me a sample of this, because that should not be an issue. Thank you! Please send to support@cosmicmind.com :) . Got it, taking a look. . @nexelen  Hey! I haven't fully figured out your issue. May I ask, do you need the UINavigationController functionality, or look? Also, the issue seems to come from a miscalculation of the statusBar size because it is not visible when the NavigationDrawerController is opened. I am going to reopen this issue and work on it more today. . @nexelen Okay, I will work more on this today :) . Not sure where you are with this. I haven't been able to reproduce this. If the issue persists, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. I don't see how the sample is wrong. The sample is meant to show you how you can put a Toolbar in a container view of any size and it will fit. If you want to see another example, or feel that this is incorrect. Please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. Excellent fix, though, it needs to be sent to development. I will let you do that. Thank you!\n. It that case, I would rather make a fix and push the new version now. As that is a bad issue to leave around. So I will take your change and implement it. Thank you for the work :)\n. That is a regression. I will post a fix for it now with the release I am doing. \n. Thank you fro sharing! \n. Thank you and the release is available 1.42.3. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. I will be working on it this weekend, with aims to update the v2.x.x branch for Monday, latest Tuesday. \n. :) I am going to leave this issue up until I am done. \n. Hey! I am finishing some iCloud integration with Graph. Once I am done, I can complete this update. Thanks! \n. Starting this tomorrow. Very sorry for any delays.\n. So this is in the development branch. I had made some updates along the way. Please consult the wiki. I will be making many more updates to get ready for Material 2. So please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask on Gitter.\n. Yes, I noticed a race condition in certain situations with the refactor. I am going to look into it now.\n. This should fix the issue 1.42.4. Let me know :) Thanks for bringing this to our attention. \n. Yes, it will be a separate branch. I am doing 2.3 and then 3. Let's leave this up for now. I would aim to have ti done for the end of the week. \n. Soon enough :) Testing iCloud support in Graph, and then I am back on to a bunch of Material updates, including this. \n. I aim to have iCloud support done in the next day. \n. Finally finished iCloud yesterday... wow that was some fun work. So I am back on making Material amazing! :) \n. So this is in the development branch. I had made some updates along the way. Please consult the wiki. I will be making many more updates to get ready for Material 2. So please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask on Gitter.\n. Have you tried the development branch? I had updated every issue it presented to me, minus a couple of warnings that I will fix shortly. Let me know if you find any issues with it. \n. Well Material is a large project and I cannot maintain 2.3, 3.0, and dev, and current. I have to update to the latest of what's available and go from there. So currently, I am supporting all the way up to 3.0, well anything that Xcode betas complain about really. \n. @ConfusedVorlon Good to know. I will take a look now. \n. Great! I have been updating it. I noticed the Beta Xcode doesn't clean files nicely. I am double checking on the latest Xcode beta 3 once its done downloading. \n. Yes, those should all have been removed. And the AnimateKeyframe file is now KeyframeAnimation. I am making an update once I verify on Xcode beta 3, which I am in the process of doing. Thank you! I will update you in a moment. \n. @ariedoelman So it was my mistake with the 2.3 and 3.0. When I started correcting the issues with Swift, I was updating everything. I actually didn't aim to do 2.3 or 3.0. So this means that I actually updated to 3.0, as anything 2.3 would have been covered. I am downloading the latest beta 3 and installing it to make further changes. \nIdeally I should have branched off and made separate branches for each version. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way, and Material is a lot to maintain when spread across many branches like that. \nSo I am sticking with a single development branch that will have everything up to date, including Swift 3.0. That said, I am also updating Material to 2.0 as I am reworking issues, and updating the API, as well as, adding new features. \nGive me a moment to verify everything in Xcode 8 beta 3. \n. @ariedoelman Thank you! Yes, I plan to implement better practices going forward. Keep the suggestions coming, as I am learning quite a bit when it comes to maintaining open source projects.\n. @ariedoelman Should all be fine now for Swift 3.0 on the development branch. \n. My pleasure :)\n. I don't get the same notices. What I do notice, is that on all my projects I needed to go through the wizard, and then it would do the cleanup needed even if the project was already in Swift 3. Also, make sure you are running the latest. \n. @ConfusedVorlon I believe you have to run it at least once. Regardless if you download the latest Material. I had to do it once, and it didn't make any changes except for some project updates to my running project. Have you ran it once before?\n. # Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project\nplatform :ios, '9.0'\ntarget \u2018MyProject' do\n  # Comment this line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks\n  use_frameworks!\n# Pods for MyProject\n  pod 'Material', :git => 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git', :branch => 'development'\nend\n. Hey! Yes, I am finishing up iCloud support in Graph, and then will be able to look into this. Generally, I am rewriting the entire CaptureView library to be more robust. I think this is a good starting point. Thank you!\n. Hey! I will be looking at this in the morning. Sorry for any delays. Thank you!\n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. How have you included the Material framework ?\n. Did you place the import Material statement at the top of the file. Also, checkout the Examples projects?\n. Which example? The one in your comments, or a certain project? Basically, I am looking to reproduce the issue. Can you send an example project with the issue to support@cosmicmind.io?\n. Cool, I will look at it :) Thank you! You should hear from me very soon.\n. So the issue is: the version of Material that you are using is not up to date. Make sure you are running this version 1.42.6. If you continue to face issues, or need any help, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. Thank you :)\nCan you share with me the setup code. If you set the textField.textAlignment it should align everything for you. \n. Yes, I would use the .Right or .Left, not .Natural. I am treating .Natural like .Left right now. I could update that, but for now that is what is happening. Subclassing is perfectly fine. Your code looks like it is doing the right thing. Another option though, which could save you some code, is to do this:\nswift\nclass MyTextField: TextField {\n    override func prepareView() {\n        super.prepareView()\n        if (UIApplication.sharedApplication().userInterfaceLayoutDirection == .RightToLeft) {\n            self.textAlignment = .Right\n        }\n        else {\n            self.textAlignment = .Left\n        }\n}\n. Generally though, I think we could add the code you are adding internally to help with this issue and solve the problem for everyone. \n. Thank you for the PR :) \nI updated it to look like this:\nswift\n/// Prepares the textAlignment.\n    private func prepareTextAlignment() {\n        textAlignment = .RightToLeft == UIApplication.sharedApplication().userInterfaceLayoutDirection ? .Right : .Left\n    }\nI will release as soon as I am home. Thanks again! I will close the issue then. \n. Released :) 1.42.7. Thank you!\n. If you are using the latest version. There are enable properties you can set. \nFor example\nswift\nnavigationDrawerController?.enabledLeftPanGesture = false\nand so forth. Give those a try, and let me know how it goes. Thank you!\n. Yes currently Material is at version 1.42.7. I believe I added the enable handler in 1.40.*. Personally I would update to the latest. So many fixes have been made.\n. The NavigationDrawerController is the new name for the SideNavigationController.\n. :) awesome! Thank you\n. If you have that code in the viewDidLoad it won't fire because it is not a child of the NavDrawer. Put it in the viewWillAppear or viewDidAppear method. Or possibly you should share your setup code for that area. \n. I need to see the setup code. How are you adding the view controllers to the NavigationDrawer, also, what are you enabling and disabling the panning for, could the other parts using pan be causing an issue. Also as a tip, you can simplify these lines\nswift\nunwrappedSideNavigationController.enabledLeftPanGesture = enabled\nunwrappedSideNavigationController.enabledLeftTapGesture = enabled\nto \nswift\nunwrappedSideNavigationController.enabledLeftView = enabled\n. Yes, you could put in the viewWillAppear a disable or enable call.\nThere is a helper optional property navigationDrawerController?.enableLeftGesture  that you can use in any child view controller. This includes deep hierarchal view controllers. \n. Yes, once I am done the work I am doing for iCloud, I will update this for Swift 2.3 and Swift 3.0 :) \nHere is the original issue 453. \n. Hey! I am signing off for now, but will check tomorrow morning for you. Thank you!\n. Sorry for any delays. I will look at this in the morning. Thank you!\n. Hey! I haven't had a chance yet to look at this. Still working out kinks on iCloud. \n. Excellent. I am sorry I didn't respond to this earlier. I am focusing on Material 2 and all that will be released shortly. In Material 2 there is a new CaptureController which will really help with the setup of the camera. I will close this issue for now. Thanks again!\n. At the current moment, I wont be changing the name. Thank you though :)\n. Do you mind sending me an example project so I can reproduce this? Thank you! Please send to support@cosmicmind.io\n. No worries :)\n. Hey, I am going to close this for now. When you get a chance to make a sample, please send it to me, and I will take a look. Thank you!\n. I am not sure I follow. Is it not only allowing plain-text to be displayed when the eye-button is down?\n. I would have to take a look at Windows 10. Currently, you are not forced to have the default behaviour. You can set the text to not be secure with the secureTextEntry TextField property. As well, you can switch the look of the eye as you please and remove the handlers on that button.\nI think you can get what you are looking for with the current system, though, it would require you to modify the default behaviours. \nAt this point, I don't have much time to work on it myself, so if you would like to work on it and submit a PR, that would be cool and we can go from there. \nI appreciate the suggestion very much. I'll try and get my hands on a Windows device and see what you are talking about first hand. \n. Anytime, and if you need any assistance with ideas and such, please join the Gitter channel :)\n. Thanks @chashmeetsingh \n. @chashmeetsingh thank you. Yes, @Piyush08 that is the correct answer. Thank you!\n. Thank you for sharing this. It looks like automatic renewal is a false advertisement by the registrar. Please visit http://cosmicmind.io/material. I have corrected the domain name purchase and it will be live shortly. Thank you for bringing this up to my attention :)\n. I'll will take a look for you. Thank you for bringing this to our attention :)\n. @azatZ Nice, thank you for the workaround. @ed-mejia The issue was that this line on 387\nswift\nplaceholderLabel.frame.origin.y = -placeholderLabel.frame.size.height\nneeded to change to \nswift\nplaceholderLabel.frame.origin.y = -placeholderLabel.frame.size.height + placeholderVerticalOffset\nWhich is similar to the workaround suggested. I am posting this solution in Material 2 (development) branch. \n. The only part of material available for macOS is the color library. As well, make sure to build the macOS target. How are you adding Material in your project? \n. Not sure. I will close this issue for now :)\n. Try cleaning your build folder and deleting your user derived directory. \n. Go to preferences, then locations. Click the arrow button to find the folder in the finder. Close Xcode and then delete. \n. Great! \n. Hey, let me look into this shortly. Generally if the enums could be marked, they should be for visibility. I will make that change, test, and post an update. Thank you! \nAlso, feel free to share the branch you created. \n. This is now updated in Material 2. Thank you very much :)\n. Thank you for this. Yes, I am aware of this issue. I have not completed the ShadowPath mapping to UIView objects with a depth/shadow set.\nI will complete this later today, or latest tomorrow morning.\n. I plan on having a fix for you tomorrow morning. @ConfusedVorlon \n. @ConfusedVorlon Hey! I am working on this, I wasn't able to reproduce unless I used your project. So I am going to make some changes that I had hoped to make around this area, then I will push it to dev and you can verify it works. I am working on it now. :)\n. @ConfusedVorlon Hey, I updated development to handle shadow paths now. Please update your pod. As well, I updated the \"Use Legacy Swift...\" flag in the Material project, but found in the Pods project I needed to do the same. Check this out for help on that, stackoverflow issue. If you need any other help with the shadows... please message me on Gitter, or create a new issue. Thanks!\n. What version of Material are you using?\n. Well, we are currently at 1.42.7. So you should upgrade to the latest, it will fix that issue. All the best :)\nWhen you update, consult the changelog. It will help you understand changes that have been made. \n. I am not sure. You would need to look in the changelog. Look when the pulse animations were updated. \n. What version of the framework are you using?\n. I haven't heard from you. If you still need help, please reopen this issue. Thank you!\n. Hi, \nI will be able to help out shortly :)\n. @chashmeetsingh Thank you for helping on this. @gtulga Yes, the API will be changing and advancing. Stay up to date with the change log. As well, I will be making new samples when we release. I am closing this issue now as it seems solved. Thanks!\n. Hi, no problem. I think we should move this issue to Gitter though. Chat with us there. Thanks!\n. Not sure why this is being requested as a PR. Closing for now. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. Try this view controller example:\n\n```\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    view.backgroundColor = Color.white\n\n    var image = Icon.cm.photoCamera\n    let v1 = FlatButton()\n    v1.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    v1.setImage(image, for: .normal)\n    v1.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\n\n    image = Icon.cm.image\n    let v2 = FlatButton()\n    v2.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    v2.setImage(image, for: .normal)\n    v2.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\n\n    image = Icon.cm.share\n    let v3 = FlatButton()\n    v3.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    v3.setImage(image, for: .normal)\n    v3.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\n\n    image = Icon.cm.star\n    let v4 = FlatButton()\n    v4.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    v4.setImage(image, for: .normal)\n    v4.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\n\n    image = Icon.favoriteBorder\n    let v5 = FlatButton()\n    v5.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    v5.setImage(image, for: .normal)\n    v5.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\n\n    image = Icon.audio\n    let v6 = FlatButton()\n    v6.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    v6.setImage(image, for: .normal)\n    v6.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\n\n\n    let container = View()\n    container.grid.axis.direction = .any\n    container.grid.axis.rows = 2\n    container.grid.axis.columns = 3\n    container.grid.interimSpacePreset = .interimSpace3\n\n    _ = view.layout(container).left(20).right(20).top(100).height(100)\n\n    v1.grid.rows = 1\n    v1.grid.columns = 1\n\n    v2.grid.rows = 1\n    v2.grid.columns = 1\n    v2.grid.offset.columns = 1\n\n    v3.grid.rows = 1\n    v3.grid.columns = 1\n    v3.grid.offset.columns = 2\n\n    v4.grid.rows = 1\n    v4.grid.offset.rows = 1\n    v4.grid.columns = 1\n\n    v5.grid.rows = 1\n    v5.grid.offset.rows = 1\n    v5.grid.columns = 1\n    v5.grid.offset.columns = 1\n\n    v6.grid.rows = 1\n    v6.grid.offset.rows = 1\n    v6.grid.columns = 1\n    v6.grid.offset.columns = 2\n\n    container.grid.views = [v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6]\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @btelintelo Should be fixed with [Material 1.42.9](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/releases/tag/1.42.9). Thanks @chashmeetsingh :)\n. I fixed it on iOS 10 as well, I pushed a sync change to the dev branch. Can you pull in the latest dev and try again?\n. Anytime :)\n. Nice :) Thank you. I will have to look into this. For now, I am going to post it as afeature request. \n. I am going to close the issue and review the PR very soon. Once again thank you!\n. Can you share your setup, or a sample project?\n. I don't see the initialization of the Toolbar. Could you share that?\n. Okay, can you send me a sample? I need to see your storyboard and such. \n. Yeah things have changed since the last time you have updated I am sure. Have you looked at this https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/tree/master/Examples/Storyboards/Toolbar ?\n. I am going to close this issue for now. If you have trouble with the example, let me know and we can go from there. It would be easier to use the [Material Gitter](https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material) channel for this :) Thank you!\n. Thank you for this. I'll take a look at this within the next couple days. I have a few other things in the queue right now. \n. What will most likely happen is I will take the ideas you presented and work it into the framework in a way going forward that allows this type of configuration.\n. Nice, I will read it through. . Let's tackle this latest by Monday :) I will review it this week and read the article. Thanks for your patience. . Thank you :) . Sadly this fell so far behind. I am sorry I never got around to including it. At this point, I will need to look into this issue from scratch. Thank you. . Cool, I will update this later today. Thank you!\n. @ConfusedVorlon this is almost done. So please pull development as I progress on this. \n. Cool, I am going to close this as the updates are being made where appropriate. Thank you!\n. @reidmain Excellent question. I have been only supporting Swift 3 and all latest updates have been in Swift 3. If you would like help in supporting 2.3, then please start the process, and I will create a branch that you can merge into and then I will take over support for it. Thank you!\n. Awesome! Thank you, please feel free to reach out to us for any help. All the best!\n. @jlaws awesome! Here is the branch link https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/tree/swift-2.3\n. No worries :)\n. @reidmain I like that choice :) I have added many updates to the Swift 3 version, so ping me if you need any help. All the best!\n. @ConfusedVorlon what is thissqueezeanimation. Where is it coming from?\n. I have an idea here. I will give it a try and share the result. \n. Please pull the latest from development. Also, I added a convenience propertyimageto avoid having to set thesetImageand in Storyboards, when you use the newimageproperty, it sets both the.normaland.highlightedstate for you, rather than just the.normal` state, which causes a grey tint on the image. \n. Hey! We have taken note of this, and will prepare for release with Material 2. \n. @adamdahan agreed. \n. @CavalcanteLeo can you try this commit: 5065e8837e10b5ba6753586aa1b832c83ddd1d18, it is available in Objc-C now. As well, have you looked at the TextField sample? To put it fully across as the image above, I will need to investigate that. . @CavalcanteLeo Yes, I reopened the issue to make an internal fix for this :) Maybe you can suggest something before I jump into this issue more.. Amazing! . What part does it override that is creating the conflict? \n. Also what version are you using?\n. When you say latest, do you mean development or master? Also, what is the actual issue. You will need to share an error log, code that is not working, or further describe. :)\n. Got it :) I agree, there needs to be a better solution. I will play with it today and tomorrow and most likely push something within then. Thanks for sharing this. \n. Didn't forget about this... going to think about a better solution today. Sorry, was busy in the past week. Thank you!\n. I am going to have to disagree. Material doesn't override any of the UINavigationController or UINavigationBar behaviours, especially when adding buttons. You will only face conflicts if you use the Material NavigationController and Material NavigationBar, which use a separate API for adding controls. So if your issue is that you want to use the default API for the UINavigationController, then you will need to opt out of using Material's. After Adam's point about the self.title, it is clear that using navigationItem.title is actually a second best approach.\nIf you can suggest a mechanism or fallback that can improve the situation that would be helpful, and a PR would be appreciated. Otherwise for now I am closing this issue and will think of ways to not conflict with the navigationItem.title property. \nAlso, one more idea for you, is that in Material 2, which is the development branch, it is possible to add the shadow effect and colors to any UIView, so this would actually help you achieve the look and feel of Material and still use the default UINavigationController. If you would like help in achieving this, please let us know. \nAll the best :)\n. Hey, I don't use Storyboards personally, so I haven't felt the pain point. It makes sense though and I will look into this. Do you have any suggestions? As well for the navigation title... agreed, I will come up with something there :) \n. Hey, I am looking into solutions for this. Thank you for your patience. :) \n. I am leaning towards removing it completely. I will make a decision tomorrow and push a solution. \n. @adamdahan 100% agree. It will be removed in Material 2, most likely in the next push.\n@zbangsatz So this is the approach :) I will close this issue once I make the push to development.\n. @IBDesignables have now been removed, in favour of a lighter weight storyboard experience. Thank you! This is available in the development branch for Material 2.\n. Taking a look :)\n. So it looks like it is working to me. Icons are coming up as well. So what is your exact setup?\nMaterial version (branch if not a release)?\nXcode version?\netc....\n\n. Toolbar project\n\n. Using storyboards example. \n\n. @puneetkohli it is actually a CoocoaPods issue not understanding bundles well. That said, there are setups where things get messed up by storyboards with CoocoaPods and bundled content. The best approach here, is to send your sample to us, and we can diagnose. Please send to support@cosmicmind.io. All the best :) \n. @iomerbakirci @PuneetKohli Hey... so I worked with your project and there seems to be an issue, as you specified. So there are two easy solutions: follow the Workspace Setup, which works with the CocoaPods workspace, or two, copy the Assets catalog from the Material framework into your project and search for the icons as so:\nswift\nmenuButton.setImage(UIImage(named: \"cm_arrow_back_white\"), forState: .Normal)\nI have seen this issue work and not work many times. I believe CocoaPods handles bundles poorly, as there is nothing special about how Material organizes the Assets catalog. \nI hope this helps and please feel free to reach out if you need any help. \n. The height is fixed at 1 dividerLayer?.frame = CGRectMake(dividerInset.left, y, width - dividerInset.left - dividerInset.right, 1) In Material 2, you will be able to customize the divider value through the Divider object. \nIf you need any further help, please let us know :)\nAll the best! \n. I agree. I will update the library for Material 2 to include this feature. I am going to close the issue request and track this internally. Thank you!\n. This is going to be completely reworked. So I will be generally making updates to solve these issues. If you have a solution locally for now, I suggest use it, and soon enough my update will come to the development branch and then Material 2. \n. Yes, this is correct. In other views this has been the setting. I haven't updated the Card and ImageCard yet, which will have this treatment :) So wonderful catch, and it will be updated for Material 2. I will make a push now to support the change you suggested, and rework the components later this month before release. \n. No worries. The temporary fix is in development. \n. Hey! I think you are trying to add a button to the center of the NavigationBar? If this is correct, you should add the button to the contentView. Internally the titleView is used to make the layout. The NavigationBar is made using Grid. So to add something to the contentView where it will be managed for you layout wise, use the following code snippet as an example:\nswift\nlet button = FlatButton(title: \"Button\", titleColor: Color.blue.base)\nnavigationItem.contentView.grid.views.append(button)\nThat's all you need to do to have the button align in the center\n. You too and if you have further issues, please use the Gitter Chanel or open up a new github issue. Thank you!\n. @leobouilloux What version of Material are you using? master or development\n. Okay, no worries. In Material 2 this is way easier to handle. For Material 1, this is a workaround:\n``` swift\nlet button = FlatButton()\nbutton.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 20, 40)\nbutton.setTitle(\"BD\", forState: .Normal)\nbutton.setTitleColor(MaterialColor.black, forState: .Normal)\nbutton.titleLabel?.font = RobotoFont.medium\nnavigationItem.titleView?.layout(button).center()\nnavigationItem.contentView?.hidden = true\nnavigationItem.leftControls = [menuButton]\nnavigationItem.rightControls = [switchControl, searchButton]\n```\nThe key is to hide the contentView and add the button to the titleView, and then use the layout facility to center it based on size. \n:) All the best!\n. You can add a handler to the clearButton, and in Material 2, I will be adding delegation calls to the SearchBar. When I get to that piece of work, I will consider this design :) thank you!\n. Yes, those are already in the queue for Material 2 :) \n. @alexliubj Material 2 is expected to ship at the end of September, and will be pushing continuous updates throughout that month. It is a really big release, so I suggest checking out the development branch to start familiarizing yourself with some of the latest concepts. \n. @svachmic They haven't been made yet, they are still a feature request. Soon I will get to them, or someone will make a PR :). Adding PR https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/864 . This issue can be closed now as the above mentioned PR is acting on its behalf. Thank you!. Wonderful :) Thank you. \nLater this week I will merge this in.\nAll the best!\n. Hey! I moved this fix into development for the Material 2 release tomorrow. Thank you very much! \n. I don't believe you can do this entirely through storyboards. You would most likely need to make your MainViewController the NavDrawer and then add the original MainViewController as the rootViewController of the NavDrawer. You can add it as your rootViewController through an instance that is generated from a Storyboard. Does this make sense ?\n@adamdahan maybe you have a suggestion here?\n. @OnlyMyRailgun This looks like an issue, It should be sizing correctly. Can you share your setup code, and the version of Material that you are using? Thank you! \n. It looks like you are using the master branch. This is fixed now in the development branch and will be fully released in Material 2. I am not updating Material 1 with any further fixes as most of everything has been rewritten. Please let us know if you need any further help. \nAlso, the version of the TabBar in Material 2 includes another type PageTabBarController, which connects a UIPageViewController to the tabs. \n. Thank you! The framework will be released by the end of this month :)\n. Wonderful :) Thank you. Would you mind sending this to the swift-2.3 branch? I just branched it off of master, so you shouldn't have any issues. \n. Thank you so much for this :) \n. Nice catch :) I pushed a fix for you. Thank you. \n. Updated NavigationDrawerController to be open :)\n. Is this blocking you? I will launch a solution before the release. But let me know if this is blocking you, so we can ensure it does not. \n. Okay we will push a fix shortly for this :) \n. I added this item as a ToDo to the Material Components project. Thanks for the suggestion. \n. Linking this to https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/549\n. I am stepping out for a bit, and I will send you answers very shortly. Thank you!\n. For the backButton, in the pushed view controller, use the viewDidAppear method to set the pulseColor. \nswift\nopen override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n       super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n       navigationItem.backButton?.pulseColor = Color.red.base\n}\nFor the NavigationController, we are writing documentation that will be out soon and will show what you are looking for. \n:) feel free to message, or create another issue if you need any further help. \nThank you!\n. Hi, Sorry, I had just made the update prior to seeing this. I did however remove the code signing from the test target after reading this PR. Your support is much appreciated. Thank you!\n. awesome! I will fix this :) \n. This should now be updated in development :)\n. Pull the latest from master, that should do it :)\n. Oh, you need to add @escaping before the function closure, Xcode should provide a suggestion, or you can share your code here.\n. Well @escaping is only needed when your closure executes after the function returns. Is this the case? \n. So the issue is probably that you have not defined that other function yet, so the compiler doesn't know what you are thinking of doing. So do not add the @escaping until you actually pass it to another function that is async. \n. I will add this ability later today. Thank you!\n. Hey, I haven't had a chance to focus fully on updating Layout to potentially handle what you are looking for. I will update you shortly. Thank you!\n. So after playing with this for a while, I am going to suggest to write raw Constraints to achieve what you are looking for. The API into Layout is meant to be simple. Going in the direction you are asking will make it complex. All the best! :)\n. Swift 3 support can be found in the development branch, which is combined with Material 2 :)\nAll the best! \n. Thanks everyone for your input. I am looking at the TextField later this week before release in Material 2. I will get back to everyone with solutions and updates. \n. Working on this today before we release Material 2. Thank you!\n. When ready, would you be able to test the development branch for a fix to the issue. Thank you!\n. Sweet! Thank you :)\n. By not working, what do you mean? \n. I am closing this issue, and soon enough we will be releasing Material 2. Thank you! \n. Yes, it is in the queue for Material 2, which is set to release at the end of the month :) \n. @tianqiujie it is now leftViews. \n. What are you trying to do with the containerView ? and let's move this to https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material\n. It is working in the development branch that is in preparation for Material 2. It should be stable and will undergo a final review on the API going forward. You can follow along here 520.\n:) All the best! \n. What version of Material are you using? And when was the last time you updated if you are using the development branch? \n. Can you confirm you are on version 1.42.9, if not on the development branch? Otherwise, the layout object doesn't even exist in version 1.0. \n. Would you mind forcing 1.42.9? You can put that in the pod spec, and it should download that version for you. \n. Excellent! \n. I tried this\n``` swift\nextension Color {\n    static var primary: Color.indigo.Type {\n        return Color.indigo.self\n    }\nstatic var accent: Color.red.Type {\n    return Color.red.self\n}\n\n}\n```\nin an external project using Material and it worked fine.\nThis allows you to do this:\nswift\nbutton.backgroundColor = Color.primary.base\nAs well, you could do this\n``` swift\nextension Color {\n    static var primary: UIColor {\n        return Color.indigo.base\n    }\nstatic var accent: UIColor {\n    return Color.red.base\n}\n\n}\n```\nand then you can access it this way \nswift\nbutton.backgroundColor = Color.primary\nSo what exactly is the issue that you are seeing? Sorry, I am not clear on this one. Thanks!\n. Ahhh I get what you mean. Yes, we can make a Color type and then you can achieve what you are looking for. Cool, I'll add that :) \n. Made a fix for this, now you can do this\n``` swift\nextension Color {\n    static var primary: ColorPalette.Type {\n        return Color.indigo.self\n    }\nstatic var accent: ColorPalette.Type {\n    return Color.red.self\n}\n\n}\n```\nAs well, the Color class is open and you can extend it alongside each ColorPalette class type. \n. The MaterialSwitch example is from version 1.*, which means that the name is not the same. Before it was MaterialSwitch and now it is Switch. You should be able to see examples in that project of how to use the Switch programmatically. The interface is the same, only the name has changed. As for your storyboards issues, I would need to see a sample of what you are doing.\nAll the best,\n. Can you clean your build folder and delete the UserDerived data ? I will take a look and see if something else comes up. \n. I haven't heard back from you, so I am closing this issue, and if you continue to face an issue, please reopen or create a new GitHub issue. Thank you!\n. Yes, the development branch is where Swift 3 support is currently. It is only on development as we make our final revisions for Material 2 and Swift 3. Please follow along here 520. \n. What version of Material are you using? This was fixed in Material 2 on the development branch with Swift 3 support. \n. Looking at your project today :)\n. Hey! \nExcellent find :)\nI pushed a fix to development. So you only need to update from CocoaPods. \nThanks again!\n\n\n\n. Yes, you need to use the development branch for Swift 3 at the moment, which is also the Material 2 branch. This will be officially released on the 30th of September. Thank you!\n. Fixed :) in the development branch! Thanks for this.\n. Hey, what version of Material are you using? \n. I believe this is fixed in Material 2 that launches in the next couple days and is currently in the development branch. \n. Okay, you will need to use the development branch, or wait until the 30th of September for Material 2s release :) \n. I am not sure, has this issue been isolated to Material ?\n. Further more, I will need reproducible steps. \n. It could be, but I would need reproducible steps. Are you trying to use PhotoLibrary ?\n. I wont have time to look immediately, and if you are not using PhotoLibrary, it shouldn't affect anything. I will try and look soon :) \n. Hey! Pull the latest, 2.1.0 and set the TextField's isPlaceholderAnimated property to false. That should create the effect you are looking for. Thanks and all the best!\n. Great suggestion :) Yes, I am familiar with Protocol Orientation. I'll give the framework a pass and see if and where possible to add this style. Protocols have their own limitations, so as long as it is possible, we will make it work. All the best!\n. You are using version 1.42.9, which is not supported. You need to use 2.1.0, which is now officially released in master. So install the latest from master, and you should be good :) \n. Switch to 'Material', '~> 2.0'\n. @kiwo12345 Actually that is my bad, I need to update that. Thank you!\n. Yes, swift 3 is very much supported. If you are using CocoaPods, you may have to manually set the legacy flag to No. \n. Awesome!!! Thank you :)\n. @hisham2007, @adamdahan is correct. We should bring this to the Gitter channel. There are some points you made that are interesting. Let's discuss them there and leave GitHub strictly for relevant issues. Thank you! \n. Well you have a delay on the animation _ = sc.animate(snackbar: .visible, delay: 1) so you cannot click the button many times and then queue the animation. You have to wait until the animation plays out. If you want to do it as many times as you click, then keep a queue, and then cycle through the queue to trigger your function to call the animations. \nAll the best :)\n. Hello, \nFrom any view controller, you can access the navigationDrawerController optional property. So you could add to a button handler the ability to toggle the Left or Right drawer by doing this:\n``` swift\nfunc handleButton(button: UIButton) {\n    navigationDrawerController?.openLeftView()\n    navigationDrawerController?.toggleLeftView()\n    navigationDrawerController?.closeLeftView()\nnavigationDrawerController?.openRightView()\nnavigationDrawerController?.toggleRightView()\nnavigationDrawerController?.closeRightView()\n\n}\n```\nAnd that's it :) \n. Thank you for reporting this. I will take a look. I am about to hop on a plane, so once I have a stable connection, I will get back to you. \n. Taking a look at this now :)\n. Hey! Material 2.1.1 should fix the issue :) Thank you for bringing this to our attention. \n. Great! Looking forward to it :)\n. I await your PR, closing the issue for now. Thank you!\n. @sohayb Thank you :)\nI added this feature request to the Material Project. I think this would be a great addition. \nYou will be able to follow the Feature Request there. Thank you!\n. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. We are experimenting with this type of option. Currently, unless you delete files yourself, you need to take them all in.\n. Wonderful, thank you. Can you send this update to development, and then I can review and merge :) \n. I will be reviewing this tomorrow for a merge :) If all is well, this will be a part of tomorrow's release. Thank you!\n. Yes, please use the master branch. :)\n. Hey! You don't want to change the contentViewController of the NavigationDrawer you will want to change the rootViewController. You can do this by using the open func transition(to viewController: UIViewController, duration: TimeInterval, options: UIViewAnimationOptions, animations: (() -> Void)?, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)?) method. \nFor example, in your LeftViewController you could do this:\nswift\nfunc transitionRoot() {\n    navigationDrawerController?.transition(to: MyNewViewController)\n}\nThere are many more parameters that can be set to control the animations. That is the general setup. I am going to add this card to the Material project and make an example for you and everyone. \n. Here is the complete solution, which I am posting now to the NavigationDrawerController example project in the programmatic directory.\nIt shows how to transition with multiple  navigation controllers, and by itself.  \n``` swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass LeftViewController: UIViewController {\n    private var transitionButton: FlatButton!\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    view.backgroundColor = Color.blue.base\n\n    prepareTransitionButton()\n}\n\n@objc\ninternal func handleTransitionButton() {\n    // Transition the entire NavigationDrawer rootViewController.\n\n//        navigationDrawerController?.transition(to: TransitionedViewController(), completion: closeNavigationDrawer)\n    // Transition the ToolbarController rootViewController that is in the \n    // NavigationDrawer rootViewController.\n    (navigationDrawerController?.rootViewController as? ToolbarController)?.transition(to: TransitionedViewController(), completion: closeNavigationDrawer)\n}\n\ninternal func closeNavigationDrawer(result: Bool) {\n    navigationDrawerController?.closeLeftView()\n}\n\nprivate func prepareTransitionButton() {\n    transitionButton = FlatButton(title: \"Transition VC\", titleColor: Color.white)\n    transitionButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleTransitionButton), for: .touchUpInside)\n\n    view.layout(transitionButton).horizontally().center()\n}\n\n}\n``\n. Material [2.1.2](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/releases/tag/2.1.2) now has the sample. \n. @SirComet You would need to call thetransitionfunction again. If you are looking for abackButtontype feature, use theNavigationControllercomponent over theToolbarController. . Has been completed. \n. Yeah I fully agree. Would you be able to PR this change?\n. Cool, then eventually I shall get to this, it is on the radar.\n. PR - https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/564\n. @reidmain Yes please. This is a good issue to have on the board and to tackle. Thank you!\n. No worries. It's much easier to customize, space, and manipulate. The entire library is not based on the NavBar, it's one of many components. That said, there are large and small benefits using any of the components. \n. You are 100% correct. I have been spending so much time getting CosmicMind's frameworks out there code wise, and we are shifting our efforts to documentation. I believe that everyone would benefit from really understanding the benefits and all the features. I don't imagine anyone is really using more than a small percentage of the actual features. \nI really appreciate this issue, because you are solidifying my understanding of what the community needs. I have two more days of coding before all my attention is on documentation. At that point the code is really stable, and its time to really teach how to use the libraries. \n. The overall real benefit that no one is seeing is the ease in a decoupled architecture for the entire UI, as well as, the ability to build additional components from the core library. In the next couple weeks we will be all about docs and examples. \n. Very interesting, I'll take a look :) thank you \n. I verified this issue, thank you for bringing it to our attention. I also like the feature request, and will see if I can add it while fixing this, if not, I will make it a standalone feature request for the very near future. \n. Hey I will be looking at this later today :)\n. Linking this issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/7\n. I will be reworking this all tomorrow. Sorry for any delays. \n. Sorry the delay. Finally had a chance to fix the issue. I will be posting an update later today. Thank you!. Please update to Material 2.4.0 for a solution to this issue :). @apemobilu Yeah, I am currently working on it within in an App I am building. Once ready, which should be soon I will release it :). No worries, tonight I a working on Samples and features :) Thanks for your patience. . Feature Request to make TabBar scrollable: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/642\n. Can you send a sample to support@cosmicmind.io? The class names have changed and this may be the issue. We have samples in Storyboards that use classes with @objc. Thank you :)\n. Excellent, thank you. I received your email. I will be taking a look shortly. \n. Looking now :)\n. You are correct. There is a warning. I believe it is because the @objc for those classes are not needed. I have removed them and there will be a release later today with the update. Thank you for bringing this to my attention :) \n. Hmmm... @markst can I see your setup code please? Thank you!. Cool, if you can do exactly that where the issue is reproducible, it would be great. Normally I would do it, but I have a lot to do at the moment. Thank you!. I'll test and make a release for this today :) Thank you! @markst . @NikunjKumbhani There is an entire repo of samples https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples :). You can find a fix for this in Material 2.7.0 :). Excellent, thank you. I will investigate this today. \n. I looked into this. I am not able to reproduce the issue. What version of Material are you using? Can you send me your project or a sample so I can investigate further? Thank you!\n. Hey! I cannot reproduce this issue and I haven't heard back from you. Please reopen or create a new issue if this persists, thank you :)\n. @lutzj82 Can you send a sample project to support@cosmicmind.com?\n. Yes, this makes sense. I will look this over and make an update :)\n. Hey, please give Material 2.3.19 a try. I believe it may fix this issue. Thank you :) . No worries. If you take a look here Material Project you can see what I am working on. \n. @hisham2007 does this need to be a TableViewCell, or could you use a CollectionViewCell ? \n. Okay, cool, thank you!\n. I will be working on this today :) \n. Hey! I am almost done the example. I have a prototype of the idea here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Graph/tree/development/Examples/DynamicCardTableViewCell. Tomorrow I will polish it off and make it look really nice :) The concepts may change, so don't get too fixated on this initial pass. \n. Hey, I started a samples project repository where I will make samples based on requests and needs. Here is your issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/2 :) We can chat there.\n. Yes it would. I will add this to the Feature Request column in the Material Project. Thank you!\n. Working on this today :). I will be reworking the Menu into a Menu, FABMenu, ToolbarMenu, and others. . This has been added, and will be released in Material 2.5.0. Thank you!. I will follow your steps to reproduce.\n. So the issue is in your AppDelegate\nThere is a class level property var window: UIWindow?\nand in your app didFinish... method you are not actually setting it. \nswift\nlet window = UIWindow(frame: Device.bounds)\nwindow.rootViewController = navigationDrawerController\nwindow.makeKeyAndVisible()\nIt should be:\nswift\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: Device.bounds)\nwindow!.rootViewController = navigationDrawerController\nwindow!.makeKeyAndVisible()\nBecause you have let window in your code, you are never accessing the class level window property. \n:) All the best!\n. No worries :) Glad you reached out. \n. The divider is now a Divider object. This gives it features independently from the card. Actually any view now has the ability to access a divider. To use the Divider it needs a color to be seen. These are the properties you can set directly from any view:\nswift\nview.dividerColor = Color.grey.lighten3\nview.dividerAlignment = .top\nview.dividerThickness = 3\nYou can access the Divider object directly using the view.divider property. \nI will be adding to the available properties, in the next release Material 2.2.1: \nswift\nview.dividerContentEdgeInsets = .zero\nview.dividerContentEdgeInsetsPreset = .square1\nIf you want to access the above properties currently, you need to do it through the view.divider property: \nswift\nview.divider.contentEdgeInsets = .zero\nview.divider.contentEdgeInsetsPreset = .square1\nThat's about it :) \n. Yes, use the swift-2.3 branch :)\n. @mxia That branch has gotten very far behind and was not supported. So I removed it in favour of only leaving branches that are supported. . @danielneri there really isn't another option. Material will be expanding a lot this month with new features. At this point only Swift 3 will be realistic to maintain. . Yes, this is in the pipeline :) I will leave it up as a feature request. \n. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1010. This would be incredible to work on. I am in. . Thank you @Recouse :). We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. @peersocialdeal I love this line \"PS: I'm not sure this is an issue, but it's my issue.\"\nI think your setup is a bit off. You don't need to manually hide the back button. That is all done within the framework. In your AppDelegate you should have a setup like this: \nswift\nwindow!.rootViewController = NavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: NavigationController(rootViewController: PageTabBarController(viewController: [VC1, VC2, ...])))\nThe other thing to note, is if you are looking to use the NavigationController because you want the look and feel, but not necessarily the actual navigation benefits, I would opt in to use the ToolbarController instead. It will give you the same look and feel, but is more simple in its usage. \nTo access the Material back button, in the page you want to access it, you should be able to do this\nswift\nnavigationItem.backButton.isHidden = true\nAfter writing all this, I think this would be a great example, so I am going to make one with this setup. It will be out later today. \nAnd thank you very much for your support, we love working on Material :) \nI will leave this issue up as a request for a sample. \n. Let's close this issue and move it to Gitter so we can chat more freely on how to approach setting up your app architecture. Ping me there when you are ready. \n. Hey, I started a samples project repository where I will make samples based on requests and needs. Here is your issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/1 :) We can chat there. \n. @phlippieb Yes, take a look here https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/1, and look at this sample CardTableView. . Hey! I think you are missing a value in your info.plist file. You need to set the View controller-based status bar appearance to NO. \n:) \n. Nice, can you send this to development though ?\n:)\n. Perfect! Thank you for this. I will get it out in the next release :) Which is later today.\n. Sounds good, after this release, I will tackle that. So much has been happening with CosmicMind, so thank you for your patience. \n. I am going to need to add this to tomorrow's release, 2.2.5. Thank you!\n. :) About to do it\n. Does it look correct https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/wiki/Installation ?\n. I believe you are correct. I was following this example Subspecs. \n. Nice, I will take a look at this tomorrow :) Thank you!\n. Oh, and can you please send this to development ? Thank you!\n. I merged your other PR :) Thank you!\n. Your PR inspired me to refactor the Animation class, thank you! \nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/486cab299bb6109132a151d1cf451f76b70122f6\n. Have you looked at the Samples repo ? All the latest examples are there. Also, can you share some code ?\n. They should work with pod install. You could also use the workspace, but you need to add the Material framework to it. I made it possible for both styles to try the samples because of the different frameworks being used. \nSo let's go forward with some error messages you are getting and sample code. \n. What version of CocoaPods are you using ?\n. Okay, so that tackles that. What are the other issues ?\n1) Placeholder text does not appear until some text is entered into the text field.\n2) placeholderActiveColor is being ignored. The color of the placeholder text does not change if the text field becomes the first responder.\n3) The placeholder label now appears to be in a different position. We use snapshot tests to ensure our UI does not change accidentally and all of our uses of Material's TextField seem to have the placeholder label shift up by about 20 pixels.\n. Also, you must have made a big jump. A lot of the components and underlying libraries were rewritten for Material 2. So I can help you catch up.\nIt could, but shouldn't be an issue. At the end of the day, the TextField is a subclass of UITextField. What I think the issue is that the API has been updated and you are not setting the correct values. Do you mind sharing your setup code?\nThank you!\n. I can see API issues that you have in your code, such as dividerColor should be dividerNormalColor. If you create a sample project I can help you from there. Send it to support@cosmicmind.io.\n. I really need code to see what you are doing. Please share the sample app. \n. Okay, I will need to review this. I notice you are using API calls that I have not necessarily mapped out. I will need to double check. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. \n. @reidmain possibly update them, but leave the ones you are using commented out. I can then make sure it all works and ship an update :) I have one coming up. \n. @reidmain cool :)\n. It should be the former, where the colors correspond to the different states. \n. It should, I will look into it. I will make this issue as a bug.\n. Agreed. I am going to spend the weekend to make the necessary changes and push an update :)\n. Will do, when I am done we will test against your use case. \n. I will be looking at this more today. Had some \"work work\" to do :) \n. Perfect!\n. I am relating an issue that came in https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/576\nLet's tackle this today :) I will post to development a proposed fix, and if possible, please test. \n. Adding this as well https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/582\n. Adding this as well https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/583\n. Adding this as well https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/15\n. @reidmain Hey, so I made these updates to the TextField, can you verify: \n- issue-568: fixed issue where placeholderActiveColor was not being set correctly when TextField was in an active state.\n- issue-568: fixed issue where setting text to nil broke the TextField layout.\n. @reidmain I will check this scenario out within an hour :) \n. @reidmain Sorry, I got majorly sidetracked with an issue I am looking at for Material. I will have to look into this more tomorrow. \n. @reidmain amazing :) Thank you\n. I tired reproducing this after I made some updates. I am basically tabbing to different fields and all seems well. I am going to make a release now with some updates. Please test this out and let me know :) Thanks buddy! If you become active and type in some text it works fine. The divider line and placeholder text are the active color. But if you move to the inactive state and then back to the active the placeholder text is the current color but the divider line is not. \n. Your app looks pretty :) All seems to be working for me. Do you mind showing me your latest setup code? \n. Thank you, and if you can, even privately at support@cosmicmind.com, you can share code with me on the setup and I can help :)\n. @jbaez what was the issue? I understand it doesn't work like before, but that may a settings change that is needed. Can you send a PR, I'd be happy to review it. Thank you!. Yes, I can make a suggestion, which version of Material are you using ?\n. Excellent. So in the latest version there are few things to consider. Each card has a structure that includes an area that can be any UIView. In the Card and ImageCard, it is known as the contentView and in the PresenterCard there are two areas, presenterView and contentView. \nAll the cards then have a common Toolbar that adjusts to the layout and bottom Bar type that is always at the bottom.\nWhat I think you can do, based on the first card I see, is use a general Card. The \"Section 1\" title would be your card.toolbar?.title. The form input area will be in the contentView and you should make a layout in a UIView that contains all the subviews in the format you are showing. You can set that container view to the contentView property. \nThe last part, will be allocated to the card.bottomBar?.centerViews. You can set another view, or button, which will expand the full area and give that center alignment. You will probably want to set the card.bottomBarContentEdgeInsets and card.bottomBar?.contentEdgeInsets to eliminate any spacing that you don't want, or to add any spacing that you do want around the centerViews. \nThere is an example that comes out on Monday, latest Tuesday that shows how to dynamically size the Card types in a UITableView in a data-driven way. Check it out CardTableView. Feel free to continue the dialog here, or open a new issue, or chat on Gitter for more help :)\n. Hi @Sufi-Al-Hussaini Yes, I can help. \nSo the latest Menu, MenuView, and MenuViewController have all been consolidated into Menu and MenuController. \nOriginally, there was a control called Menu that was wrapped by a UIView called MenuView. Now they are together in a single View object called Menu. \nIf you would like, you are able to place that in your current UIViewController as a subview, and then add the baseSize, itemSize, and views appropriately. This will avoid the issue you are having with navigationItems because the UIVIewController is the same. \nIf you choose to use the MenuController, then you are introducing a new UIViewController that takes your current one and sets it as the child. In this case you would need to set the navigationItems within a subclass of the MenuController and in the rootViewController you would place the other subviews as before. \nThe reason Material works this way, is to allow you to layer or stack the controls like MenuController, ToolbarController into organized pieces that are perceived to work all together. This removes a lot of coupling. \nI hope this helps. Please reopen or create a new issue if you need :) All the best!\n. The Menu has open and close methods: \n``` swift\nopen func open(duration: TimeInterval = 0.15, delay: TimeInterval = 0, usingSpringWithDamping: CGFloat = 0.5, initialSpringVelocity: CGFloat = 0, options: UIViewAnimationOptions = [], animations: ((UIView) -> Void)? = nil, completion: ((UIView) -> Void)? = nil)\nopen func close(duration: TimeInterval = 0.15, delay: TimeInterval = 0, usingSpringWithDamping: CGFloat = 0.5, initialSpringVelocity: CGFloat = 0, options: UIViewAnimationOptions = [], animations: ((UIView) -> Void)? = nil, completion: ((UIView) -> Void)? = nil)\n```\nYou can add a handler to your base button, btn1 triggers the menu to open, and in there, the completion block, or before, you trigger the rotation animation you see in the example. \n. wonderful :) \n. awesome! :)\n. So I believe I know what the issue is. When the Button is initialized, it removed the insets on initialization. You are using Storyboards, and Storyboards freeze dries the initialization and executes at a different time. I will make an adjustment to correct this. Would you be able to test development to see if the solution works for you?\n. Yes, please try the development branch. The proposed fix is up. \n. Great! I will push the fix with the next release :) Thank you\n. This is now in master and released in Material 2.3.0. Thank you for pointing this issue out. \n. Hey, yes, I can help. Here is some sample code that shows properties you can set to change the color states.\nswift\nemailField.placeholderNormalColor = Color.amber.darken4\nemailField.placeholderActiveColor = Color.pink.base\nemailField.dividerNormalColor = Color.cyan.base\nemailField.dividerActiveColor = Color.green.base\nAll the best :)\n. Ah, thank you. I will make a change for this. \n. Great question. I will aim to put new documentation every day starting today.\n. Thank you :) \nI am putting this as a feature request on high priority. \n. No worries. So you know, the way I am building Material is in layers. I try and solidify each stage of the framework to ensure that when I add more, it has stable foundations. So RTL is a great next step. \n. @tarek903 I may be able to squeeze it in as I work on Editor (TextView). . I am going to release a roadmap once I finish the documentation and release for Motion and Material. I will comment on all open feature requests soon. Thank you!. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Hi, sorry about this, there had been a regression. There is another issue that is tracking this, so I am going to close this one off and link yours to it, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/568. \nThank you!\n. Hey!\nI found storyboards to behave interestingly in some cases. Though, I have never seen this. \nI pushed a potential fix to development, could you try the development branch?\nIf that doesn't work, then please send a sample to support@cosmicmind.com so I can assess further. \nThank you for bringing this to our attention :)\n. @gristoi Yes, the issue there is that your RootViewController had the handler set, and now you have a NewViewController, so now your handler is not available any longer. This is where you can leverage the AppMenuController to put in base code that is shared amongst your transitioning root view controllers. \n. I am going to make a release with the fix to this issue later today. I will close this once that happens, until then, please try to move your handle code to the AppMenuController to avoid loss of the handler functionality :) \n. The fix for this is in master :) Material 2.3.2. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. \n. I am investigating a solution for this :)\n. Hey, sorry for any delay. I found this StackOverflow question and answer, and it shows how to add colors as a palette to IB. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2889491/how-to-define-colors-in-xcodes-interface-builder\nI don't think there is an easy import method for this. If you have found any solutions that I can help implement or you want to PR, it would be very much appreciated. \nThank you!\n. I can't seem to find any way to do this in Carthage. If you have an idea of how, as I am not that familiar with using Carthage, please reopen the issue with your suggestion. One idea is to separate out the privacy components into separate repos and component libraries. This is something I am thinking about. Sorry I couldn't be more help on this. . I am revisiting the TextField to look at the issues that have popped up. Sorry for the inconvenience. \n. I have linked this issue with a previous issue on TextFields. So I am closing this one and will keep the discussion there. Thank you!\n. Can you share your setup code for this? Also, if possible, please try the development branch, as I made some updates. Thank you!\n. I am going to test this tonight with the other issues that surround TextField and update you. Thank you for your help :)\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this. I am making a release with TextField updates today. Would you be able to share a sample project? Thank you!\n. When I get my hands on a reproduction of this issue, we can open it up again. Thank you very much for submitting this :) \n. Thank you for sharing this. Today I am planning to look at the issues with the TextField. Sorry for the inconvenience. \n. Yes, takes time to maintain Material, that said, it is a lot of fun to do so :)\n. There was an issue when the text property was equal to nil. I had fixed that, and now in development there is a modified TextField. Would you be able to test it to see if your issue still persists? Thank you!\n. If this is not fixed, could you send me a sample project that I can use as a reference and reproduce the issue? Thank you!\n. Thank you for this, I will take a look. I am currently working on both the Textview and TextField. I will follow up with your example and fix very soon :) I appreciate your help very much. \n. Fixed the issue :) This was a really good catch, thank you! I am pushing a release now with the fix along with some others, in Material 2.3.10. \nAlso, just incase, your app sample had an issue:\n``` swift\ntextFieldSomething.detail = \"Error!\"\ntextFieldSomething.detailColor = UIColor.red\ntextFieldSomething.detail = \"Error!\"\ntextFieldSomething.detailColor = UIColor.red\n```\nshould be\n``` swift\ntextFieldSomething.detail = \"Error!\"\ntextFieldSomething.detailColor = UIColor.red\ntextFieldSomethingElse.detail = \"Error!\"\ntextFieldSomethingElse.detailColor = UIColor.red\n```\nThank you :)\n. No worries :) Thanks for you help. \n. Yes, that is a great idea. I will put that in the next release. \n. This is ready for release and coming out today :) Thank you!\n. Released :) Material 2.3.9\n. Try the:\nswift\n    open var isBounceEnabled: Bool {\n        didSet {\n            scrollView?.bounces = isBounceEnabled\n        }\n    }\nThis currently removes all bouncing from left to right, so will effectively stop the swiping. I plan to refactor this shortly. So to get the page to stop bouncing, set the \nswift\npageTabBarController?.isBounceEnabled = false\nof if you subclassed the PageTabBarController, you can set the property to:\nswift\nopen override func prepare() {\nsuper.prepare()\nisBounceEnabled = false\n}\nFor now this is the easiest way. Let me know how it works, thank you :)\n. I can't seem to get the rootViewController property to appear in the Storyboard pane. I am not the best with Storyboards as I do everything programmatically. So if you have a proposed method to accomplish this, I would be able to help you make it happen. For now, I am going to close this issue and leave it to you to reopen it if needed. Thank you!\n. I think that you have either one of two issues, the button is too large, or you need to set the contentViewAlignment property to .any so that it doesn\u2019t try and center the contentView and create a funny alignment.\n. Try the 'centerViews' property for the button. Sorry on the road, I could answer in more detail tomorrow. \n. @aemgtz Have you had a chance to try the centerViews property?\nSome insight on the NavigationBar with NavigationItem. \nThe NavigationBar is made from 3 main areas, the leftViews, contentView (centerViews), and rightViews. When you start to add items to either of the view areas, from the left to the right, it calculates the positioning of the items based on the contentEdgeInsets, interimSpace, and UIViews being positioned themselves. \nThat said, there are scenarios when you would like to center the items in the contentView, which is in the middle of the leftViews and rightViews, and in order to do that, the contentView needs to make adjustments to compensate for the difference in views on either left or right side. This is where you could use the centerViews property to tell the contentView that you want things centered there. As well, you can specify to ignore the additional compensation by setting the contentViewAlignment property to .any from .center.  \nIn your case, it sounds like you want the calendar button to be in the center, which will be best done using the centerViews property. \nThere is more detail to all this, and I think it would be best to post this knowledge on CosmicMind.com/material where everyone can learn. \nSo I will do that. If you have any other issues, please reopen or create a new issue, or chat on Gitter where we can get into more details. \nThank you :)\n. Nice catch. I'll investigate, and please share more if possible. Thank you :)\n. I verified the issue. I will fix this tomorrow. Thank you!\n. The fix is in Material 2.3.4. Thank you for bringing this to my attention :) \n. Yes, I want to go through each part. I closed your issue as it was related to GridAxis itself. Let's reopen this issue and treat it as a general memory leak investigation :)\n. No worries :) I figured it out. \n. I am going to continue to make improvements in this area if I find any issues. For now, unless there is a specific memory leak found, there doesn't need to be an issue. Thank you for bringing this to my attention :) \n. Hey, I can help you out, but let's move this to Material Gitter. Ping me there :) \n. Yes, it is definitely coming in the near future. There is already a request for it, so I will close this off and link it this issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/560, \nThank you! Keep the great feature requests coming. \n. Yes, I had seen this earlier today. I will post a fix for that within the hour :) Thank you!\n. Please fine a fix in Material 2.3.6 :)\n. Hey, sorry about that, this was a regression. Please find a fix in Material 2.3.7 :) Thank you!\n. Hey :) I can help, but let's move this to Material Gitter. Ping me there and I will help you out. \n. This feature is now ready and will be released with the next Material release. Thank you for sharing your ideas :) \n. Hey, yes, the MenuView and Menu became one in Material 2, so now Menu is effectively the old MenuView with the mechanics of the previous Menu. \nSo  few things I am seeing here. \n1. You can omit these lines: menu.addSubview(btn3), when you set menu.views = [btn1, btn2, btn3] it automatically adds the views to the menu as a subview. \n2. These lines can be omitted as well:\nswift\nbtn3.setImage(image, for: .normal)\nbtn3.setImage(image, for: .highlighted)\nand you can now use this one line:\nswift\nbtn3.image = image\n1. This line looks off: \nswift\nMenu(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 50, height: 50))\nIt looks like you are adding the menu to the top left corner, is this correct? And, you need to ensure that it is not behind anything and is brought to the front. \nTry these updates, and let me know, I would be happy to help further :)\n. You should be animating the Menu in this case based on how you have it setup. Is it possible to share a sample with me and I can help fix it up?\n. Hey, so I looked at your sample and I noticed a lot of fighting between layout, frame, and animation. So I wrote a simple sample for you to replace your current code with:\n``` swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\nfileprivate let menu: Menu\n\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n\n    prepareMenu()\n\n    view.layout(menu).size(menu.baseSize).bottom(24).right(24)\n}\n\nrequired init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n    menu = Menu()\n    super.init(coder: aDecoder)\n}\n\noverride func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    showingButtons()\n}\n\nfunc showingButtons() {\n    menu.views.first?.animate(animation: Motion.animate(group: [\n        Motion.rotate(rotation: 3),\n        Motion.translationY(by: -120)\n    ]))\n}\n\nfunc handleMenu(_ open: Bool = false) {\n    print(\"handled\")\n}\n\nfunc helpAction() {\n    print(\"helpAction\")\n}\n\nfunc prepareMenu() {\n    let btn1 = FabButton()\n    btn1.depthPreset = .depth2\n    btn1.pulseAnimation = .centerWithBacking\n    btn1.backgroundColor = Color.red\n    btn1.tintColor = Color.white\n    btn1.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleMenu(_:)), for: .touchUpInside)\n\n    let btn2 = FabButton()\n    btn2.tag = 1\n    btn2.clipsToBounds = true\n    btn2.contentMode = .scaleToFill\n    btn2.depthPreset = .depth1\n    btn2.pulseColor = Color.white\n    btn2.backgroundColor = Color.indigo.darken1\n    btn2.borderColor = Color.white\n    btn2.borderWidth = 2\n\n    let btn3 = FabButton()\n    btn3.tag = 2\n    btn3.contentMode = .scaleToFill\n    btn3.clipsToBounds = true\n    btn3.depthPreset = .depth1\n    btn3.backgroundColor = Color.lightBlue.base\n    btn3.pulseColor = Color.white\n    btn3.borderColor = Color.white\n    btn3.borderWidth = 2\n\n    menu.direction = .up\n    menu.views = [btn1, btn2, btn3]\n}\n\n}\n```\nLook at this code and see how things were setup. This should help you get going in the right direction :)\n. So I figure this out. It turns out that iOS has changed the animationDidStop method which updates the final values to a delegation call CAAnimationDelegate. So I made a fix for this and will push a new release :) \nThe following example will now work this issue: \n``` swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass AppMenuController: UIViewController {\n    fileprivate let menu = Menu()\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    view.backgroundColor = .white\n\n    prepareMenu()\n\n    view.layout(menu).size(menu.baseSize).bottom(24).right(24)\n}\n\ninit() {\n    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n}\n\nrequired init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n    super.init(coder: aDecoder)\n}\n\noverride func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    showingButtons()\n}\n\nfunc showingButtons() {\n    menu.animate(animation: Motion.animate(group: [\n        Motion.rotate(rotation: 3),\n        Motion.translateY(by: -120)\n    ]))\n}\n\nfunc handleMenu(_ open: Bool = false) {\n    print(\"handled\")\n}\n\nfunc helpAction() {\n    print(\"helpAction\")\n}\n\nfunc prepareMenu() {\n    let btn1 = FabButton()\n    btn1.depthPreset = .depth2\n    btn1.pulseAnimation = .centerWithBacking\n    btn1.backgroundColor = Color.red\n    btn1.tintColor = Color.white\n    btn1.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleMenu(_:)), for: .touchUpInside)\n\n    let btn2 = FabButton()\n    btn2.tag = 1\n    btn2.clipsToBounds = true\n    btn2.contentMode = .scaleToFill\n    btn2.depthPreset = .depth1\n    btn2.pulseColor = Color.white\n    btn2.backgroundColor = Color.indigo.darken1\n    btn2.borderColor = Color.white\n    btn2.borderWidth = 2\n\n    let btn3 = FabButton()\n    btn3.tag = 2\n    btn3.contentMode = .scaleToFill\n    btn3.clipsToBounds = true\n    btn3.depthPreset = .depth1\n    btn3.backgroundColor = Color.lightBlue.base\n    btn3.pulseColor = Color.white\n    btn3.borderColor = Color.white\n    btn3.borderWidth = 2\n\n    menu.direction = .up\n    menu.views = [btn1, btn2, btn3]\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Fixed and released in Material 2.3.12. \n. Thank you! :) It has been a dream working on Material and building with our great community. \nAs for helping you, yes, I can for sure help you. What version of Material are you using?\n. Great! I will take a look a bit later today and help you out :) I will share with you a few ways to accomplish this. \n. You can use Application.isStatusBarHidden = true, that can be used anywhere, and you could set the navigationDrawerController?.isStatusBarHidden = true property. \nGlad you found a way :) \n. I will take a look, and if you can, please send a reproducible project :) \n. Thank you, I will take a look and make an update :) . Taking a look now. \n. I downloaded your sample, and updated Material to 2.3.21, and go this outcome: \n\n\nLooks fine to me. Is there something I am missing here?. Oh may, I need to try this on an iPad. I will try that now. . I see the issue now, I will fix this, one moment. . I fixed it, now running tests to avoid a regression, and then I will post an update :) Thanks for bringing this issue up :). Please find a fix for your issue in Material 2.3.22. Thank you :). I appreciate it. You are already helping by bringing issues to the community :) Thank you!. Hey, \nSo in Material 2, I silently launched a new component that is officially launched at the end of the month. It is called Editor. It now encapsulates all the work needed to setup a dynamic textView. Later today I will post an example for you, and for now if you can take a look at the Editor and EditorController API, that will get you started. For example: \n``` swift\nlet editor = Editor()\neditor.textViewEdgeInsetsPreset = .square4\neditor.textView.font = RobotoFont.regular\nview.layout(editor).edges()\n```\nPlace that code in a UIViewController and see what happens. You could also hook delegation methods and a new enum for tapping into character attributes. For example:\n``` swift\nextension ViewController: EditorDelegate {\n    @objc\n    fileprivate func editor(editor: Editor, willProcessEditing textStorage: TextStorage, text: String, range: NSRange) {\n        textStorage.updateAttributes(characterAttributes: [.font: RobotoFont.regular, .forgroundColor: Color.black], range: range)\n    }\n@objc\nfileprivate func editor(editor: Editor, didProcessEditing textStorage: TextStorage, text: String, range: NSRange) {\n    textStorage.updateAttributes(characterAttributes: [.font: RobotoFont.bold, .forgroundColor: Color.blue.base], range: range)\n    print(editor.uniqueMatches)\n}\n\n}\n```\nLet me know how it goes. Also, I made an issue Samples Editor Issue that we can use to get you up to speed with a sample project :) \n. @theolof Its coming really soon :) When is the latest you need it by?. Okay, I will do my best to have it done really soon. It is one of the final parts to releasing the Editor component. So I need it and want it done as well. Thanks for your patience. . I am a few hours from being done the TextView will placeholder and simplified interface. I will push a release by tomorrow. Thank you!. Hey, please find your feature request in Material 2.6.0 and a sample TextView project. Thank you and all the best! . Hey :)\nSo in this case, the comment is actually outdated. As well, you can set it to a value that you like. There should also be a velocity measure applied internally in the algorithm that calculates the distance to open and close the NavigationDrawer. \nPlease try and set the leftThreshold and rightThreshold to a value that works more for you. If you feel there is an improvement that can be made and have a chance to prototype a PR, I would be happy to review it and work on it with you. \nThank you! \n. Hey, \nCan you try Material 2.3.11 ? I have added the @objc attribute to the recognizer. \n. Fixed and released in Material 2.3.12. \n. Hey, the detailView is the contentView. There has been a change to the math behind the card. It is now calculated without AutoLayout. This was done for performance reasons. In general though, the UIView that you place needs to have an intrinsicContentSize or a height given to it, otherwise, it doesn't know how to calculate the size. \nThat said, the contentView property itself is a UIView, but not all views will be able to determine their content size dynamically. So you would need to set a height for instance. \nswift\ncard.contentView = UIView()\ncard.contentView?.backgroundColor = Color.grey.base\ncard.contentView?.height = 100\nWhen you set a UILabel as a subView of the contentView it is even further removed from making a  dynamic calculation. So you would need to manage the size of that content itself, then everything else will fall into place. \nIf you have something you are trying to create, send me your sample code and I would be happy to help :)\n. I am going to try your sample today :)\n. So I tried your example, and without setting the height, it is not possible to make it work. So dynamic height is not built in. That said you inspired a new feature. I am going to make an additional layout tool that will make these situations simple to handle. I will followup in a couple days with a solution for you. \n. Wonderful, I am happy to help :)\nMy aim is to have a solution that you can test within a few days. So hopefully that wont block you too much. \n. Sorry for any delays. I have been a bit held up on some other tasks. I should be able to focus on this in the next couple days.. I am going to link this in with another issue and move this to a general Layout update feature request: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/621. For now the issue is a limitation and not a bug and I believe I have a suggestion. I am going to think about layouts over the next couple days. Suggestions in the other issue are more than welcome :) . Thank you for this, could you send this to development and I will accept it :) \n. I am going to take this change from your code, as I want to make a release now that includes this. Thank you very much for your help and I appreciate the PR :)\n. Hey! Would you be able to share your project as a sample to support@cosmicmind.com and I can take a look ?\nAnd welcome to iOS and Material :)\n. @AndreMarvell yes, try updating to the latest Material 2.3.19. Sorry, I didn't update this issue yet. It should be closed now :). Yes, I will add this to the feature request list :)\n. No worries. There are new features coming out this month, and next month. I will include it in one of the major updates :)\n. @cody1024d soon, I am releasing some updates within the next day, and then going back to the feature request list. . The next release will include a bunch of updates. This latest update I have been working on for a couple months now, getting the latest Motion framework in. At the moment, I have not had a chance to work on an indicator, though it should be fairly simple with the Motion framework now. So I will prioritize it, make a list like you are requesting and update the repo. Sorry for any inconvenience. . Hey! I haven't had a chance to work on this yet. I am wrapping up the new education centre, and once that is out, components will be flying out the door. Please share a starter project for this, or wait a bit longer and it will be in your hands. Thank you!. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. @mihailsalari we have a bunch of new features coming out and will release them with documentation. Then we will add a roadmap for the next batch of components. The indicator is something we want, but not something that made it into the latest updates. Thank you for checking in. . Nice, adding this to the list of items to investigate with the PageTabBar rewrite. . This component has now been updated in Material 2.8.0. Features like swiping have not been included in 2.8.0, and will be included in a following release. The overall TabsController adds stability and scrollable Tabs. I am closing this issue and thank you for your patience. . The TabsController doesn't have a swipe feature. So there shouldn't be anything conflicting with it. If you can send me an updated sample, I can take a look at what is going on: @kizitonwose, thank you!. Yes, it is in the short list to release :). @kizitonwose Most likely within a couple weeks. . I will take a look at this. I have gathered a a few issues on the PageTabBar, so I will be most likely rewriting it to include more features and correct all the issues. Thank you for sharing this, I have added it to the list of things to investigate. . Working on this now, and this is a related issue, please follow this one. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/619. Using strictly storyboards no, there isn't an example. It could be possible with a bit of code and storyboards. I will work on a sample and place it in the Samples repo :) If you would like to further discuss this, let's chat in Material Gitter. All the best!. Have you tried this function: \nswift\nopen func setViewControllers(_ viewControllers: [UIViewController], direction: UIPageViewControllerNavigationDirection, animated: Bool, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil)\nIt allows you to set the Array of UIViewControllers. . Okay, I will take a look. I am planning to update the PageTabBar this week, so I will investigate today to help you out, and then release a new PageTabBar. Thanks :). Hey, I didn't forget about this issue. I will be able to focus on it within the next couple days. Sorry for any delays. . @asyl Yes, this is in the queue to fix. I was working on launching Motion. Will be updated soon. . @asyl Thank you for sharing. I am working on an update to simplify switching view controllers. Your reference is very helpful :). You can now use the selectedIndex property to select a tab in Material 2.6.2. For example: \nswift\npageTabBarController.selectedIndex = 3\nThank you!. I appreciate your suggestion. At the current moment making such a change would not be ideal. I am going to close this for now, but that said, I will think about this more and see if I can come up with something elegant to solve this issue :) Feel free to discuss more with me and the community on Material Gitter. . Could you send me a sample of this? . This could be when the UITableVIewController is setup. Usually this is done after the view loads and could give a stutter effect. I will take a look and see if I can replicate the behavior. \nAlso, this issue came up and could be the same on StackOverflow - flickering behavior.\n. Ahh... I think I know why. Okay, I will take a look later today. I am finishing up some documentation, and then will tackle this issue and some others on the board. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. . Thank you for sharing this issue with me. Please give Material 2.3.18 a try :) . I'll be back later today and can help you out :) . Hey, so to do what you are looking for is relatively easy. In your AppDelegate, you can instantiate a SnackbarController and set the rootViewController to your UITabBarController. For example: \n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\n\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = SnackbarController(rootViewController: MyTabBarController())\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n}\n```\nIf you are using storyboards, you will want to do something like this: \n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\n\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = SnackbarController(rootViewController: UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"MyTabBarController\"))\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n}\n```\nOnce that is all working, you can access the SnackbarController with the optional UIViewController property snackbarController?.snackbar. \nFor your initial view controller, be mindful that you will probably need to access the snackbarController?.snackbar property from the viewWillAppear method because the viewDidLoad method will not have access because the MyTabBarController won't be connected to the SnackbarController just yet. \nYou can look at this Programmatic SnackbarController Sample for a programmatic approach, and this Storyboard SnackbarController Sample for a storyboards approach. \nHope that helps and feel free to reopen or create a new issue if you need any further help :) . You can place the SnackbarController at any layer you like, and in this case, I think it makes most sense to be the lowest layer at the window's rootViewController. In some cases you may even want to add the SnackbarController as the base of each tab. So feel free to explore combinations, the SnackbarController is designed to fit anywhere based on needs. . @codemodouk are you trying to access the Snackbar through the viewDidLoad method? If so, it may not be accessible because the view controller has not been added to the hierarchy at that time. Try the viewWillAppear method, and use the optional snackbarController property found as a UIViewController extension. . @codemodouk yes, you should be able to get a handle so long as the view controller is a child of the SnackbarController in the view hierarchy. Keep me posted :). No worries. Where are you accessing the snackBarController property in the UIViewControllerChild?. If you are accessing it in the viewDidLoad it may not actually be connected yet, which means that the optional snackbarController won't be available. So put that code in the viewWillAppear and it should be accessible. \nLet me know if that works for you. Otherwise, can you share your code in that view controller so I can see what is going on. \nPlease reopen the issue if you need :). No worries, I am testing it again now. . So there are two issues here: \n\nBecause you are presenting the view it actually doesn't have access to the SackbarController, which can be remedied by doing this:\n\n```swift\nfunc animateSnackbar() {\n        guard let sc = self.snackbarController ?? presentingViewController?.snackbarController else {\n            return\n        }\n    _ = sc.animate(snackbar: .visible, delay: 1)\n    _ = sc.animate(snackbar: .hidden, delay: 4)\n}\n\nfunc showSnackbar(withText text: String) {\n    guard let snackbar = self.snackbarController?.snackbar ?? presentingViewController?.snackbarController?.snackbar else {\n        return\n    }\n\n    snackbar.text = text\n    animateSnackbar()\n}\n\n```\nYou will see that I am using the presentingViewController to access the snackbarController if it doesn't find it in the current view controller. \n\nThe second issue is that the presented view is above the view of the presenting view hierarchy. I would try presenting the view controller using the snackbarController itself, so you will need to update your storyboard. \n\nThe other option is to wrap the presented UINavigationController with another SnackbarController, and you will be able to reuse the same code in your extension. I recommend this one.\nLet me know what you choose and if you need, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. Hey, no worries, trying is how you learn. You should in your segue launch the SnackbarController that wraps the UINavigationController, and not have it do it from storyboards as well. Try that, and let me know. . Seems like it can't find this GreenViewController. Maybe you need to remove that reference as that is probably from the sample code. As for the code, that looks like the correct idea if not the correct way. I don't do much with storyboards. See if you can remove the GreenViewController reference, and if you still have an issue, please let me know. Thank you!. If anyone would like to send a sample over that reproduces this issue, I'd be happy to help. Thanks!. I will take a look :). Is the issue that your views are behind the TabBarController ? If so, this is not actually a Material issue, but iOS in general. You need to set the edges of the view controller. Set in your rootViewController this property:\nswift\nedgesForExtendedLayout = []. I understand that. The frame doesn't get increased by any factor, rather it is made the same as the previous that is being transitioned from. \nswift\nviewController.view.frame = rootViewController.view.frame\nIf you can share a sample that replicates this, that would be great. You are placing this inside a TabBarController, which does alter the size of UIViewControllers that are within it. Now I am not blaming that, but it is the only item that stands our right away. The RootController manages all navigation controller types (ToolbarController, MenuController, PageTabBarController, SnackbarController, etc... ) So I would suspect that the issue would manifest in all those too if there was an increase being set within the RootController. \nThis is where a sample project that replicates the issue would be very helpful.  . :) Thank you!. I will take a look tomorrow :) . Looking at this now :). So it all works :) I don't think you were showing the snackbar. Add this: animate(snackbar: .visible) to the AppSnackbarController class\nThe Snackbar is hidden by default. . Fixed the issue :) Will make a release momentarily. . Please update to Material 2.3.21 :) It should be aligning correctly now. Thanks for catching this issue.. Yes, there is an issue. I am pushing a fix within the hour. Thank you!. Please update to Material 2.3.20, where you can find a fix for this issue. :) Thanks\nYou can find a sample project at Grid Sample. . Yes, that is a good suggestion, I have done that for certain classes, such as Capture / PhotoLibrary. I'll make an update for that.. Hey, I am not going to get a chance to do this for a while. So I have put it as a note. To clean up the project board, I am closing this issue. Thank you! . @Maxatma No, it fell way behind on the priority list. @OrkhanAlikhanov what do you think of subspecs for this?. Thank you for helping to make Material wonderful :) Yes, I can make an update with this feature in the afternoon. . Please update to Material 2.3.21. You can use the snackbarEdgeInsets and snackbarEdgeInsetsPreset to position the Snackbar away from the edges anywhere you would like :) \nThanks and all the best!. Are you doing this programmatically or storyboards ?. So there are a couple ways to do this. If you want to add the Menu itself, you can do so using the Menu view. This is done by adding a UIView to the storyboard and then specifying the class to be a Menu. In code you would need to add all the buttons. Another way, and this will require you to do things a bit more programmatically, is to set your UINavigationController.rootViewController to a subclass of MenuController, possibly calling it AppMenuController. In there, you will need to fetch your current view controller and load it from storyboards and place it as the rootViewController of the AppMenuController. In the following code there is probably a lot more code than you want to have, so make the adjustments as necessary. This is the general idea: \n```swift\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\n\n/* This would be done in storyboards ***/\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = NavigationController(rootViewController: AppMenuController())\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n}\nclass AppMenuController: MenuController {\n    private let baseSize = CGSize(width: 56, height: 56)\n    private let bottomInset: CGFloat = 24\n    private let rightInset: CGFloat = 24\ninit() {\n    super.init(rootViewController: UIStoryboard.viewController(identifier: \"RootViewController\") as! RootViewController)\n}\n\nrequired init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n    super.init(rootViewController: UIStoryboard.viewController(identifier: \"RootViewController\") as! RootViewController)\n}\n\nopen override func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n    view.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten5\n\n    prepareMenu()\n}\n\nopen override func openMenu(completion: ((UIView) -> Void)? = nil) {\n    super.openMenu(completion: completion)\n    menu.views.first?.animate(animation: Motion.rotate(angle: 45))\n}\n\nopen override func closeMenu(completion: ((UIView) -> Void)? = nil) {\n    super.closeMenu(completion: completion)\n    menu.views.first?.animate(animation: Motion.rotate(angle: 0))\n}\n\nprivate func prepareMenu() {\n    menu.baseSize = baseSize\n\n    view.layout(menu)\n        .size(baseSize)\n        .bottom(bottomInset)\n        .right(rightInset)\n}\n\n}\nclass RootViewController: UIViewController {\n    internal var addButton: FabButton!\n    internal var audioLibraryMenuItem: MenuItem!\n    internal var reminderMenuItem: MenuItem!\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    view.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten5\n\n    prepareAddButton()\n    prepareAudioLibraryButton()\n    prepareBellButton()\n}\n\nopen override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n\n    prepareMenuController()\n}\n\n/// Handle the menu toggle event.\ninternal func handleToggleMenu(button: Button) {\n    guard let mc = menuController as?

Can you share your setup code? It should be working if it is in the rootViewController class, which is AppMenuController. Thank you :). taking a look now :)\n. I got it working, and now only need to make sure there are not any regressions. I needed to make an update to Material. I will post an update very soon. I am aiming for tonight :). I made some updates to Material, which will come out in an hour. Here is the code you can use, that was modified from the ToolbarController sample. Basically, you need a container view that is used for the Toolbar calculations, and then you can center an image within there :)\n```swift\nclass AppToolbarController: ToolbarController {\n    fileprivate var profileView: UIView!\nopen override func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n    prepareProfileView()\n    prepareStatusBar()\n    prepareToolbar()\n}\n\n}\nextension AppToolbarController {\n    fileprivate func prepareProfileView() {\n        profileView = UIView()\n    let imageView = View()\n    imageView.shapePreset = .circle\n    imageView.image = UIImage(named: \"daniel\")\n\n    profileView.layout(imageView).width(30).height(30).center()\n}\n\nfileprivate func prepareStatusBar() {\n    statusBarStyle = .lightContent\n    statusBar.backgroundColor = Color.blue.darken3\n}\n\nfileprivate func prepareToolbar() {\n    toolbar.interimSpacePreset = .interimSpace4\n    toolbar.backgroundColor = Color.blue.darken2\n    toolbar.leftViews = [profileView]\n}\n\n}\n```\n\n. Please update to Material 2.4.0 for a solution to this issue :). wonderful :). Yes, I agree. I finally have a chance to visit the PageTabBar issues :) This will be fixed in the next update for PageTabBar. . This is a related issue, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/606. Working on this now. . @drinkius No need to look into it. It is an issue that will be solved in a replacement component coming out, TabsController. Solving it in the current component will be replaced anyways. \nThank you though :) . This component has now been updated in Material 2.8.0. Features like swiping have not been included in 2.8.0, and will be included in a following release. The overall TabsController adds stability and scrollable Tabs. I am closing this issue and thank you for your patience. . Thank you, I will take a look today. . No worries :) It was in the Motion library. The CAAnimation that sets the delegate, I believe should be omitted. I will make a push. This would have been a really hard bug to fix if I had not been working in that area already. . This was the fix.  I will include it in the next release :). Please update to Material 2.4.0 for a solution to this issue :). Give me a day or two think about this. I have been thinking about expanding the layout system. . Today I will be playing with some ideas. I will let you know what I come up with :). Hey, I didn't get a chance to fully hash this out. I have been really busy for the past few days, and was only able to help out on so many issues. I am back in full gear now, so I should have something in the works very soon :). Hey, so I have been thinking about this for a bit, and I don't see me working on a new Layout system for a bit. So I am going to make a note to look back into this, and close the issue for now. Thank you!. Are you meaning to improve support for Storyboards in general ?. If you mean to support storyboards more in general, that is coming as development continues. If you have a PR or a specific issue, please reopen or create a new issue :) All the best!. Hey, thank you for this. What version of Material are you using? And by App, do you mean the sample app project, or your own? . Can you send me a sample then? I will need to reproduce this, and if it is not happening in the sample, I need to see what is going on in your end. I'd be happy to help :). Hey I haven't heard from you. If you still have the issue, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you :) . Can you show me where this is stated and I can make an update. Also, if you set the value programmatically, it doesn't necessarily mean you do not want to know in your delegation handle. Are you doing this on initialization?. I am going to come back to this issue later today. Sorry for any delays :). So I like the reasoning and there is documentation that reinforces your notion. So let's make it happen. I will make an update to Material with your suggested behaviour. Thank you very much for bringing this to my attention. I will notify you when I make an update later today or tonight depending on some other issues I am working on. . Can you test the development branch and let me know if the behaviour is correct? If so, then I can make a release.. Please share here :) Also, I don't know of any global variables in the Switch. Another place to discuss, is at the Material Gitter channel, which is great as well, and probably better in this case.. Yes, I agree. Also, I like your suggestion earlier to not use a variable to maintain the interaction state, but to use a function with encapsulated logic :) Great job. This should be done tonight or tomorrow, where I will ask for you to test again. Thank you!. Updated development with your suggestions :) I will finish the other controls tomorrow with a release. . So this is now in Material 2.4.1. I applied the fix for both the Switch and TabBar, but not the NavigationDrawerController. That is not a control as the others are. That is more of an architectural controller and the delegation methods are meant to hook features with or without user interaction. Not like the Switch which is a direct control. We can discuss this more if you like, but I didn't feel it was right, so I didn't make the change. I am open to a discussion as always :) Thanks again buddy! . @sovata8 I am going to make the same changes to the NavigationDrawer and new components coming out. I have been thinking this over and I think that all delegation methods should only fire on user initiated interactions. :) Thanks again \nThis will be out in Material 2.5.0. Was this working before? Have you tried the CardTableView sample project? Also, if you are defaulting all values to 0 in the Layout.edges you don't need to set them, you can do this layout(cardView).edges(). . Hey, I haven't heard from you, so if you still face this issue, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you very much :) . Cool, I will be looking at this tonight :). @azizuysal Hey, I opened the TextField sample. I wasn't able to reproduce this. If you don't mind sending a sample to support@cosmicmind.com, that would be very helpful. Also, what version of Material are you running? . @azizuysal thank you for sending the sample. I will be out tonight and tomorrow, so I will take a look within the next couple days. I need to do an update for Xcode 8.2 and run a full test against Material. So this is good insight and I appreciate it. . Hey, So I ran an experiment. I made a new UITextField and then set the size to 40 with Roboto font. All worked correctly. Then I switched the UITextField to a Material.TextField and all still worked correctly. I didn't add any constraints and such, kept it at the default. In Material there isn't any modifications to the UITextField itself that should cause this. Everything else is added around the UITextField. I have attached images for my experiment. I looked online and found similar issues to yours that were caused by AutoLayout constraints. I am going to close this issue and invite you to chat with me at Material Gitter to help solve your problem. I am closing the issue because it is not a direct problem with Material. All the best and I look forward to chatting with you :)\n\n\n\n. Hey :) Thank you for sharing this issue. I will take a look and see, it might be a bug, or a limitation. Is it possible for you to share both a screenshot and your code setup so I can see what you are trying to achieve? . So I tested this out. It looks like a limitation based on the calculations. I can make this more dynamic and will correct the issue. I will work more on this later today. Wonderful catch, thanks :). Hey, I didn't forget about this. I wanted to tackle some issues prior to diving in. I think today would be a good day to play with a solution :) All the best and sorry for any delay. . Hey :) @quanguyen It is one of the next items on queue to be looked at. Sorry for any delays. . @angelix It is still in the queue. If you want it to move faster, help by coding it up with me. Telling me it's uselessness is just as useless. . @angelix no worries :) It is more helpful to always be helpful. \nAnyway, the NavigationBar uses an internal Toolbar, which inherits the Bar. So look in the Bar.layoutSubviews function to get started. If you start looking at this, I can guarantee that it will be tackled sooner. Possibly @mohpor may be available to peak at it as well. . Linked issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/58. The linked issue has been confirmed as fixed. If this issue still persists, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. The BottomSheetController will be release in Material 2.5.0. . Yes it will. Everything in Material is customizable :) . Hey, @JuandreBarnard . Yes they are coming. I was waiting to build Motion before I made those components. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. So I tried the latest NavigationDrawerController sample with Material 2.4.0 and all works. Can you try that and verify? Based on your setup, all looks good. . No worries :) we are here to help. Hey, Thank you :) It is a pleasure to work on Material with a wonderful community.\nFor your issue, yes please provide a sample. The warnings appearing are not necessarily a bad thing. They could have surfaced from improvements to the Layout class that I had recently added, which now reveal an issue in the TableViewCell layout code. One issue, I am thinking may be the cause is that the TableViewCell.width may have a value of 0, and the constraint is failing. Either way, a sample will help. . Hey, I haven't heard from you. If you still have this issue, please reopen it or create a new one. All the best :). No worries :) Travel safe and have fun.. What version of CocoaPods are you using?. Sorry didn't mean to close the issue. . I haven't heard from you, so I am going to close this issue. It should be fixed with updating to the latest CocoaPods, either the beta or the latest stable release. If you continue to have this issue, please reopen this issue. Thank you :). Hmmm... can you send me the project so I can try? Because all works for me. Also, make sure to clean and clear your cache. Maybe something is getting in the way. . Hmm... can you update to Material 2.4.0 and try ?. perfect :) Thank you!. This is strange... can you send a sample project to support@cosmicmind.com, I will need to be able to reproduce this. Thank you :). Hey, I haven't heard from you. If this issue still persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Also, please update to the latest Material. All the best :). Please send me a sample, and I can take a look. Send to support@cosmicmind.com :). Thank you, I am looking now :). So I have taken a look at your project. When you get a chance, let's chat on Gitter Material. I am going to close this issue here, and help you on Gitter :) This isn't an issue with Material. I need to show you how to set this up. . I am actually going to write an article about this now, and post the full instructions on how to use the Card with Storyboards.. \n\n@calvinsug I added to the development branch Storyboard Card sample project. I will be writing about this tonight and then release a final copy once done into master with any Material updates at the same time. . Then you shouldn't use the Card, you can use a View and that will give you the drop shadow and radius effect :) . No worries :) Have fun and experiment with Material. There is so much you can do and it really comes to life when you explore. For your reference, these are the settings: \nswift\ndepthPreset = .depth1\npulseAnimation = .none\ncornerRadiusPreset = .cornerRadius1. Hey,\nWhat version are you using? Thank you :). So I double checked, and the latest master has a fix for this. This was a great catch... I caught it early on from a release I made, so an update should be good to fix it for you. Thanks again :). I can add this to the new Editor component that is coming out this month. . @IceFloe Hey, So the only way to support multi-line text is with a TextView and that has been released :) Let me know if you need any further help. All the best!. Well a PR is always nice :) . This is a great place to post the issue. Thank you, I will investigate it and make a fix :) . Thank you for sharing this, I am posting a fix to the app store. All the best :). An updated copy has been submitted to the AppStore, version 1.0.4. . Ah... very interesting. Thank you I will test this out. Can you share your code setup?. I confirmed the issue. Fixing it now :). Try Material 2.4.6 for a fix :) Thank you, this was a great find. . Doesn't sound like a bad suggestion to me :) It will be out by the end of the month, along with all the other latest features. . Adding this for release Material 2.5.0. . Hey, here is the commit for your feature request. It will be out shortly in Material 2.5.0 :) Currently the new animation is called tap and is set like so, pulseView.pulseAnimation = .tap. . Sweet :). Yes it is already in the works :) I will leave this up as a Feature Request. Thank you.. Hey, @brucehappy, thank you :)\nI don't have anything coming in the immediate future, but near future yes. If you had some ideas you want to share, that would be great. . @brucehappy The scrollable TabBar is almost done.. Not sure what the Button Bar approach is. Any links you want to share on that?. Then the answer is yes :). @Akshayp101192 The width of the line will be automatic, and the swipe feature is automatic too. Are you having trouble at the moment with the PageTabBarController to achieve this?. I am working on that feature. It is in the development branch and almost ready to go. I have been making some really key updates, and unfortunately they are all necessary to release at once. I mentioned in another issue that I plan to have this done within a week. Hopefully that works for you :)\nAs a note... a PR was submitted for the scrollable part and it works well, but I have to massage the code base to make it production ready. . @ro22e0 I am almost done. Finishing some documentation for Motion's latest release / rework, then finishing the TabsController with a release. . This component has now been updated in Material 2.8.0. Features like swiping have not been included in 2.8.0, and will be included in a following release. The overall TabsController adds stability and scrollable Tabs. I am closing this issue and thank you for your patience. . I answered on StackOverflow :) It is not a bug, it is AutoLayout not used correctly.. What version of Xcode are you using? This is interesting, I tested your code and the Sample project and I am seeing behavior I have not seen before. . The issue is that it is aligning from the center, not the top as would be expected. I am working on a fix now. . Fixed it, now running tests and confirming I didn't create any issues :) This was a really good catch. . Please update to Material 2.4.3 and it should work perfectly with the suggestions I had made earlier. Thanks again, this was a really good catch. . Please update to Material 2.4.4. \nTo change the state programmatically, use: \nswift\nlet control = Switch()\ncontrol.switchState = .on\nor \nswift\nlet control = Switch()\ncontrol.setSwitchState(state: .on, animated:  true) { (control) in \n    // Do something\n}\nor \nswift\nlet control = Switch()\ncontrol.isOn = true\nIf you need any further help, please reopen or create a new issue :) . Have you seen this SnackbarController sample ?. Hey, I haven't heard from you. If you are still having issue, please reopen or create a new issue :) Thank you!. Hey :) \nI tested this using the latest Material and TextField sample, where all worked out well. What version of Material are you using and what is your setup?. I made a change which I think will help. I was able to reproduce your issue somewhat, and with the change I made it fixed it. I will be putting this for release now and you can let me know how it works out. . Try Material 2.4.5 :) All the best.. Can you share your setup, because it should work. As well, I updated the TextField again with Material 2.4.6. . @jeantimex This is great insight. I will keep playing with the TextField and see if I can improve its setup. It is a pretty tricky component, as it has so many setup cases, and requires many moving parts simultaneously. I really appreciate your help and feedback :) Thank you!. Hey :) Thank you, I love working on Material with our community. As for your question, are you aware of the delegation methods for the NavigationDrawerControllerDelegate ? I think what you are looking for is to be notified when events occur with the NavigationDrawerController.rightView ? Is this correct?. The rightView is a container for the rightViewController. In any sub view controller of the NavigationDrawerController, you can access the NavigationDrawerController using the optional helper properties. So in your viewWillAppear or some other function other than viewDidLoad, you can do this:\nswift\n(navigationDrawerController?.rightViewController as? FilterViewController)?.delegate = self\nThe reason you do not want to put this in your viewDidLoad is because when you construct the view controller, it will call the viewDidLoad method, but you would have not attached it yet to the NavigationDrawerController, which would result in a nil value for the optional navigationDrawerController property. \nGive this a try :) Should get you in the right direction. If all is well, please close the issue, and let me know what you did. . Hey, thank you :) A PR would be great actually. I have some other feature requests I am working on. If you don't get a chance to send one over, I will get to it soon. I placed it on the project board. Thank you.. Yeah, I hope support does come soon. CocoaPods is common for iOS packages in general pre swift. I will close this for now, and when there is support, we can make it happen :) . Hey :)\nCan you show me your setup? Also, check the pulseColor and that you are using either Button, FlatButton, FabButton, or RaisedButton. . No worries :) Anytime you need help, feel free to ask. . Can you send a sample project of this? :) Thank you!. Yes, thank you :) I will fix this for the next release. . Looking into this today. Thank you!. Hey, sorry this has not been fixed yet. Let me take a look :). @muzoman it has not been fixed yet. Basically reusing the same view controller and not initializing a new one causes the issue. It is one of the next issues I am going to fix. . @muzoman anytime. My majority of time is working on the education center. So I am splitting support and that for the next little while. Normally, issues are fixed faster. . @muzoman  I'll release this fix by Friday if it is fixable, which it will most likely be :) . sweet :) . Looking today :) . Issue has been fixed and will be in the next release. This is the commit 6f9f6ca92d83e1a4be5eeedecac8728323a66f00. Thank you! :). Hey, this is the correct way for now \nswift\nself.setViewControllers([self.viewControllers[0]], direction: .forward, animated: false)\nThat said, I am rewriting the entire PageTabBar. There are many updates I would like to add to it. There is already a card for this https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/608 so I will close this issue and you can follow that one :) Thank you for bringing this to our attention. . Excellent that you have made a temporary solution. I am almost done the addition of the animation and transition library for Material, and that is what I am going to use for the PageTabBar. It will be available soon. Thanks for your patience :) . This is the same feature request as https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/608. \nPlease follow that issue. Thank you!. Can you share your code setup :) ? Mainly I want to see how you are setting the value programmatically. If you can send me a sample that would be even better. Thank you!. Since you are using Storyboards, can you send this as a sample project? I don't know what you have as constraints, so replicating the issue is tricky. Please send to support@cosmicmind.com. Yes, looking now :). Fixed your issue, I will make a release :) . Please find your fix in Material 2.4.8. Thank you :) If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new issue. . Keep the issues coming if you have them :) I am updating Material this entire month based off the great feedback and usage you and others are doing :). How are you trying to install it, it looks like the connection failed. Have you tried again today?. No worries :) All the best!. Make sure you are using the latest Material. If you are using CocoaPods you might need to run this before installing: \nbash\npod cache clean --all\n. Interesting. So all is good now?. All the best and thank you for sharing your issue :) . Ahh, great catch. Yes, 2017. Thank you, I will make an update for this now. . Thank you!. Excellent! Thank you, will take a look this weekend. . The solution for this is in this issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/982. Hey, I will be able to look at this tomorrow :). Hey, so I had been playing around with your code and it is a really weird situation. Very interesting actually. I read throughout StackOverflow and it seems that the layout of the default textLabel behaves different in various situations. So I did an experiment and added a UILabel to the TableViewCell with the following code:\n```swift\ncell.width = view.bounds.width\nlet label = UILabel()\nlabel.text = data[\"name\"]\nlabel.frame = cell.bounds\ncell.addSubview(label)\nreturn cell\n```\nThis is in the func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell call. \nYou can probably trim it down, and all seemed to work. So my suggestion for this case would be to add a label of your own and manage it in a subclass of UITableViewCell or TableViewCell. \nIf you continue to have an issue, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you! :). Hey :) Welcome. \nThere is this boolean:\nswift\ntextField.isPlaceholderAnimated = false\nIt wont animate, but will be at the top. Is that what you are looking for?. So to confirm, you want the placeholder, but not the animation ? Or you don't want it at all. If you don't want it at all, you don't need to set it. Otherwise, I may need to consider this a feature request. . Okay that would be a feature request then. I can make that for you :) . I will make it work within the next couple days, latest the end of the week. . I will aim to get this out to you today. . Hey, so the update is in Material 2.4.11. To use it, set the placeholderAnimation enum like so:\nswift\ntextField.placeholderAnimation = .hidden\nThat should do it :) All the best!. No worries :) . Hey :) Thank you!\nFor your questions:\n\n\nUse the pageTabBarAlignment property of the PageTabBarController. \n\n\nI am adding in the dynamic width feature, as I am rewriting the PageTabBarController component. I am almost done the new MotionAnimation and MotionTransition library for Material, which is what I need for the updates. \n\n\nIf you have any other issues, please reopen or create a new one :) . Hey :) Thank you! To change the color of the backButton, you can use the navigationItem.backButton.tintColor property for the view controller you want to change it for. Take a look at the sample NavigationController project line #47.\nPlease reopen or create a new issue if you need any further help :) . Did you set it in the correct view controller? Take a loot at that sample. That should help you out :). I agree @OrkhanAlikhanov :) I will make this a feature request and include it in Material 2.5. . Hey @PetresS Not at the current moment, because the property is not open. I made a switch now, which will make its way to the next release. \n@OrkhanAlikhanov I am closing this issue, as I have a feature request to allow for theming, which will handle this. As well, this fell behind my current schedule of features, and I have to re-prioritize it. Sorry for any delays. . Hey @OrkhanAlikhanov You can do this to set the global configuration of the backButton:\n```swift\nclass AppNavigationController: NavigationController {\n    override func prepare() {\n        super.prepare()\n        guard let v = navigationBar as? NavigationBar else {\n            return\n        }\n    v.backButtonImage = Icon.arrowBack\n}\n\n}\n```. Ah sorry, I was read this incorrectly, well then that will need to be handled through theming. Thank you for the clarification :). You make a great point here, and there is a feature request to start allowing global color configurations. Maybe you can help me do this by outlining the details we should cover and we can make the change for everyones benefit. What do you think?. Nicely done :) Thank you! I am going to review this before Material 2.5 releases, and include this in. The end of the month is the latest release date. . Hey, adding this in Material 2.5.1. I didn't want to hold Material 2.5.0 any longer. Thanks and this will be in very soon. . Thank you very much :) !!!!. I will add this in the new updates I am making for TextView and Editor :) Always happy to receive suggestions, thank you! . This is now available and will be in the next release tomorrow. Thank you!. Hey, please find your feature request in Material 2.6.0 and a sample TextView project. Thank you and all the best! . I would have to setup a sample project to test this, but you could try masking bounds and setting the cornerRadius property. TextView is essentially a view, which should support this. Let me know before I setup a test project :). Thank you! I am going to close this for now and welcome any questions or suggestions as always :). Hey! \nTake a look at the following properties available for the TextField. \nswift\ntextField.placeholderNormalColor = Color.amber.darken4\ntextFieldField.placeholderActiveColor = Color.pink.base\ntextFieldField.dividerNormalColor = Color.cyan.base\ntextFieldField.dividerActiveColor = Color.green.base\nAll the best :) . Hey, there is a way to adjust the height, using the height property, or heightPreset property. Both will adjust the size of the Snackbar text area since that is dependant on height. Also, there is a function UIFont.stringSize... that will calculate the CGSize of a string based on a given width and string value that uses a given UIFont. \nGive that a try, and let me know if you need any further help :) Reopen or create a new issue if you need. All the best!. Hey! \nYou can set the depthPreset or depth property, for example:\nswift\ntoolbar.depthPreset = .depth2\nThat's all you need :) All the best!. Yes, because when it is clear, iOS will set the background on whatever is being drawn. . Well the issue I see with that is that it will have to create a background color, which will have the developer want to change that color. Currently, it is defaulted to white, which is pretty much a force shadow unless you change or remove the color. . Ah... interesting. Cool, I will leave this as a feature request and look into it for the upcoming releases. Thank you very much :) . I think this would be a nice addition. Let's do it. If we have an issue for it, let's close this one, or the other so their is only one to follow. Thank you!. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Ah no worries, and with MotionTransition, which I am working on, you will be able to do such animations. All the best :). Hey :) At the current moment they only set at the bottom. You could however set this type of behaviour with a custom UIView that is set within the UIButton property for the TabBar. Let me know if you need any further help, all the best!. Hey, I am not sure. You need to provide some code, or sample project I can look at, and describe the relationship to Material that you believe it is. Also, what version are you using for Xcode, Material, testing device... etc?\nPlease reopen the issue when you have these items :) Thank you!. Hey, what version are you using now? I believe I have fixed this, and if it has not been released yet, it is definitely coming up in the next release. I spent a lot of time fixing up this control for Material 2.5. Can you confirm the latest has it? Material 2.5 is near ready and will have a definite fix. Here is an article you can read that describes the new FABMenu's usage: Transitions With FABMenuController. . Okay, there is a fix in Material 2.5 for this. So when I release it, I will close this issue and you can update :) . Hey, I have tried both the CardTableView and MenuController samples with Material 2.4.12 and cannot reproduce the issue. Material 2.4.12 is a new release today. Please give it a try, and if the issue persists, reopen the issue. Also, if you could send me a reproducible sample to support@cosmicmind.com that would be great. Thank you :) . Hey :) \nThat is strange, everything is working for me. I will look into this. Thank you for bringing the issue to my attention. . So I cannot reproduce this issue. Possibly clear your Derived Data folder. Also clean the project and make sure that you don't have old builds around. If the issue persists, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. Hey, I am working on a release that will bring a new and more robust menu, FABMenu, to Material. Once I do that, I will give it to you to test and confirm the issue is fixed. Here is an article, Transitions With FABMenuController that you can read in preparation on using the new FABMenu.. Oops... I put my local dev machine address. Here is the correct one Transitions With FABMenuController.. The latest release of Material 2.5.0 is out. Thank you!. Yes, this is a great suggestion and has been added in Material 2.5.0 for the FABMenu. I will look at adding it to other similar style views. Thank you! I will leave this open as a feature request until I release. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Hey, nice catch. Please find a fix in Material 2.4.12. The samples have been updated as well. Thank you!. Hey :) \nThe issue is that the calculation is based on the height, and since it is a circle, the width is adjusting to the size of the height. So it is pushing the image out. I will take a look at this now and see if I can add a fix. . Working more on this today :). Hey, I am working on your issue using the issue-677 branch. So far coming along. . So I reviewed the issue and I realize there isn't an issue with Material. Your settings need to adjust. In the last try you set the values directly without wrapping them. That is correct. To move the title label over, you need to set the toolbar.contentViewAlignment property to .left or set the titleLabel.textAlignment value to .left. To create symmetry, the contentView holds the titleLabel and detailLabel and balances their spacing based on the opposite side views.\nIf you still have an issue, reopen this one. Thank you!  . The centerViews is in the contentView area. So I would still set it to .full. Can you share a quick sample so I can see what is up?. Cool, I will take a look. Thank you!. Hey, is this still an issue? If yes, please reopen it, otherwise sorry for any delays and inconvenience.. Okay, I am making an update to the RootController types, which includes the ToolbarController. I am going to reopen this issue and investigate further. Thank you!. If a UIViewImage is used, it looks correct. @theolof thoughts?. I tried the sample and it should work with the latest Material 2.4.16. If the issue persists, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. Yes, there is an issue with the NavigationBar. I know what it is and have already been working on a fix. It should be done soon. Please use the following issue to track https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/681 updates.\nThank you for sharing the issue. . Sorry about that. Yes, there was a regression. I am working on it in the following issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/681, please follow that one.\nThank you for sharing the issue. . Hey, yes, there is a translucency issue, which I am resolving. A fix should be available very soon. . @Ybrin working on a solution for this. . Yes, I am working on it for the next release. Basically the hold up is going through everything to make sure all works well and to complete many issues with this release. Sorry for any delays. . No, you are correct. I didn't want to wait longer to release 2.5.0, so I will release this fix and a few others in 2.5.1. I will be working on it today and tomorrow. So it shouldn't be more than a day to get this to you. . @svachmic Hey :) Can you test the development branch and let me know if this solves the issue? Also, I didn't have an issue setting the background color in general, so if you could share some code if the proposed solution does not fix your issue. Thank you!. So I was able to revert back to the original settings. All should be fixed. If the issue persists, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. You should be able to find the fix in Material 2.5.1. Thank you :). @svachmic anytime :). Sorry about that. Yes, there was a regression. I am working on it in the following issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/681, please follow that one.\nThank you for sharing the issue. . This is a good suggestion. Let me double check and if this is not a feature, it should be. Thank you :). @Tolriq If you keep a state variable for the active button/tab, you could ensure it is always highlighted. That would be basically what I would do internally. You can do this by subclassing the TabBar or PageTabBar and adding the property, and then listen in on selection changes by overriding the select method. I would go about it that way as an initial idea. . Let's follow this issue now for the feature request https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/823, thank you!. Sorry about that. Yes, there was a regression. I am working on it in the following issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/681, please follow that one.\nThank you for sharing the issue.  . Hey, there is a fix for this already in the next major release. I am running through all the sample projects so that I could make the Material 2.5 release. The new menu is called FABMenu once released. I will leave this open until I release the next update. . Hey, this should be fixed in Material 2.5.0 using the latest FABMenu. All the best!. You could specify the leftViewOffset value to any size that you want. So it is at least the height of the textField + an offset of 16, which sets the image nicely and then gives space between the text. You could change the leftViewOffset value to whatever you like, +/-. If you want to override the leftViewWidth property, it is open for that reason. I will play with ideas on making this easier, but I don't see a clear issue here. Feel free to reopen this issue if you need more help :), and if possible, I will make an update that makes this easier to work with. . Hey, yes, in CocoaPods it is an optional addition. The easiest way to remove the issue is to delete the Reminders and RemindersController files. There is an issue to investigate using Carthage with optional file additions. I hope that helps for now and all the best. I will be looking into the optional file additions within the next few days before I release the next major update.  . I removed Reminders from the latest Material, as they will be separate additions going forward. @timoman . I found this StackOverflow question that may be able to help you. If you need, please reopen the issue for more help. All the best :). There was an issue with the podspec and only colors were supported. I am removed macOS support completely as of now. Thank you and all the best!. So the way I understand setting the title with a UINavigationController is that you need to always set the value in the latest rootViewController. In your original setup:\nswift\nlet navigationController = AppNavigationController(rootViewController: bottomNavigationController)\nthe rootViewController is the bottomNavigationController, so the title should be set there. If you don't want to set it there, and want to set it in a deeper nested view controller, you would need to climb the hierarchy to that rootViewController. Maybe we could simplify this, as it is an iOS thing, and Material subclasses UIKit. If we could think of a design, we can then build it out. Let me know and sorry for the late reply on this issue. . I believe it is because I left a schema in the project. I am fixing it now. . Hey, sorry about this. The fix should be in Material 2.4.19. Thank you!. No, you would need to use the NavigationController to do this. . No worries on asking questions here. There was a 2.3 version but it fell very behind the current 3.0 Material features and so I dropped the support for it. I am about to update Material to version 2.5 within the next 24 hours. So I would suggest making the update if you can. All the best and keep the questions coming if you have any. . Yes, I took a look and looks good. I will test and review tomorrow :) Thank you! . Thank you for the PR, it worked out well. You should be able to find your fix in Material 2.5.2. All the best!. Nicely done, I will review this tomorrow and merge it in. Thank you!. Thank you! Works wonderfully :). Cool :) I will add this as a feature request. Thank you. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Thank you :) \nCan you share your setup code?. @theolof thank you for your help on this one :). There is a feature request that is along the lines of this. I will link it here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/575, I will push this up the priority chain, as I could imagine it is needed by many people. Thank you!. Please follow https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/575 for updates to this. Thank you!. @Yaldo425 Take a look at the NavigationController storyboard example. If you need, reopen the issue. All the best :). @Recouse What do you mean by it doesn't work? . Take a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345561/how-to-create-a-multiline-uitextfield. Yes, the correct solution is to use a UITextView over a UITextField. . @SanRam yup, I am working on that for the next release. . @cody1024d I don't see this being a priority for a while. Contributions are always more appreciated than asking for work to be done ;) all the best! . @cody1024d Sounds great :) But let's do one better. Join Material Gitter and we can hash it out together as you go. I want to make updates to the TextView in general, so maybe this is the right time. Also, we can chat freely on there and more may join the conversation. I appreciate your help :). On the next release, I will have an update for this. This conflict shouldn't exist. Thank you!. Sorry, closed the wrong issue. This has been reopened. . Linked issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/722, and a solution will be out shortly. Thank you!. To avoid conflicts, the navigationItem.title and navigationItem.detail have been moved to navigationItem.titleLabel.text and navigationItem.detailLabel.text, respectively. . Please follow https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/704, which is similar to this, and will be solved with the latest update to TextView. Thank you!. I am almost done a rework on the TextView, called Editor. I will double check this is correctly setup before I ship it. Thank you!. I believe these two are connected, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/703. . This is now fixed and will be released tomorrow. Thank you!. Sorry, I didn't get a chance to release the TextView when I had hoped. There is a version of it in development that works if you would like to try. Here is a TextView Sample project. \nThe version in development is pretty stable, I haven't seen any errors, but I am not done the default configurations, so I have not released it yet. \nI'll close this issue when I make the release :) All the best!. Hey, please find your feature request in Material 2.6.0 and a sample TextView project. Thank you and all the best! . Can you share your project with support@cosmicmind.com? . Hey, sorry for any delay. Tomorrow I will tackle your issue :) \nThis weekend has been busy with some other work. \nAll the best!\n. So nowhere in your code did you actually add the SnackbarController. This is one option of how to do it and is in the Snackbar sample. Take a look at the AppDelegate. \nIf you need, please reopen the issue :) All the best!. @Yaldo425 This is not entirely correct. If you set the SnackbarController as the root, it itself has a root, and that is where you will set your Storyboard. You can see that in this AppDelegate file, and in this SnackbarController sample project using Storyboards. If this is not ideal for you, the last option is to add a Snackbar to your view controller and copy the animation logic in the SnackbarController.  Let me know :) All the best!. Sounds correct, I will add your PR fix to the next release :) Thank you!. Hey, sorry, I had not had a chance to merge this in. It is now merged. I will post a release later today. Thank you!. @tomdaniel0x01\n100%, I plan to reorganize the site to help. As well, I am not even teaching all that these frameworks can do. So that should improve as well. I hope you are enjoying the frameworks so far. All the best :). Hey, really sorry I didn't get to this earlier. The issue is a minor bug with hiding the back button using multiple methods at the same time. So hidesBackButton needed to be set to false to avoid the ... that appeared. All the best and hope you are having fun with Material :). It's Apple's way of saying there is a title value that is not fully being shown. It is like Mate..., but in this case it is only the .... This is the behaviour of Strings that are too long in some cases when coding with iOS :) . Hey,\nIf you want to update the PageTabBar, you would need to edit the buttons directly. There is a feature request to add functionality to make this easier, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/683.\nYou can access the buttons through the pageTabBar.buttons property. If you need to do this from one of the view controllers, you can use the pageTabBarController optional view controller property.\nswift\npageTabBarController?.pageTabBar.buttons.first?.image = ...\nAre you looking to set the pageTabBarController.pageTabBar property to a subclass of the PageTabBar ?. You could use an extension as well, PageTabBar is an open class. \nswift\nopen class PageTabBar: TabBar. Hey I haven't heard back from you. If you still have an issue, please reopen this. Thank you!. @markst try subclassing CSTabBar: PageTabBar not TabBar. . This might be because it is a let property. Another option is to add an extension to the PageTabBar with your changes. I would need to double check my statement: This might be because it is a let property, but you may be able to do that while you work with your code. . @stachon Please share the design you are trying to accomplish. Thank you!. You could add a handler to the button, and there are delegates you can tap into. \n```swift\n@objc(TabBarDelegate)\npublic protocol TabBarDelegate {\n    /*\n     A delegation method that is executed when the button will trigger the\n     animation to the next tab.\n     - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n     - Parameter button: A UIButton.\n     /\n    @objc\n    optional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, willSelect button: UIButton)\n/**\n A delegation method that is executed when the button did complete the\n animation to the next tab.\n - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n - Parameter button: A UIButton.\n */\n@objc\noptional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, didSelect button: UIButton)\n\n}\n```\nHave you looked into those?. @stachon btw... there is a newly created TabsController that will replace all this with added and missing features. So hopefully that will help solve your issue. . @stachon sorry, I meant the PageTabBarControllerDelegate. Thanks, I think it will be a good one :) . Hey :) \nThank you! I am happy to see you using Material. \nYou should set the pulseAnimation property to .none. \nswift\n(cell as? TableViewCell)?.pulseAnimation = .none\nYou only need to cast if the cell is considered the default UITableVIewCell or another type.\nAll the best :) . Hey, so the issue is that the menuViewController has no idea about the toolbarController. The relationship between them is the NavigationDrawerController. So you need to write this in your menuViewController.\nswift \n(navigationDrawerController?.rootViewController as? ToolbarController)?.transition(to: DashboardViewController())\nYou should take a look at the NavigationDrawerController Sample project to see how this is done with the same setup. \nThat should do it. All the best!. Any time :). @Z--EN Yes, you need to update to the latest syntax. All the best!. Thank you! I will take a look :). Nice update, I am going to look through this today :) Thank you!. I will try this and see, thank you!. I can't seem to reproduce this. Could you send me a sample project? Also what version of Material are you using?\nPlease reopen the issue once you have these two items. Thank you :). I tried again to reproduce this, with Material 2.5.2, can't get it to crash. Would you mind sharing a sample project, or trying an updated version? Also, are you using the simulator, or device, and if so, which one? Thank you!. Hey :)\nSo that won't work. You can remove the SearchBarController and use the NavigationController directly. From there, you can then add the SearchBar to your navigationItem.centerViews property in the view controller you want to have the SearchBar displayed. \nLet me know if you need any further help. Here is some sample code: \n```swift\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    var window: UIWindow?\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = AppNavigationController(rootViewController: FeedViewController())\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n}\n```\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass AppNavigationController: NavigationController {\n    open override func prepare() {\n        super.prepare()\n        isMotionEnabled = true\n        prepareNavigationBar()\n    }\n}\nextension AppNavigationController {\n    fileprivate func prepareNavigationBar() {\n        navigationBar.depthPreset = .none\n        navigationBar.dividerColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n    }\n}\n```\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass FeedViewController: CollectionViewController {\n    fileprivate let searchBar = SearchBar()\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    isMotionEnabled = true\n    view.backgroundColor = .black\n\n    prepareSearchBar()\n    prepareTextField()\n    prepareNavigationItem()\n}\n\n}\nextension FeedViewController {\n    fileprivate func prepareSearchBar() {\n        searchBar.depthPreset = .none\n        searchBar.backgroundColor = nil\n        searchBar.delegate = self\n    }\nfileprivate func prepareTextField() {\n    let leftView = UIImageView()\n    leftView.image = Icon.cm.search\n    searchBar.textField.leftView = leftView\n    searchBar.textField.leftViewMode = .always\n\n    searchBar.motionIdentifier = \"searchBar\"\n    searchBar.textField.cornerRadiusPreset = .cornerRadius2\n    searchBar.textField.backgroundColor = Color.grey.lighten3.withAlphaComponent(0.5)\n    searchBar.textField.delegate = self\n}\n\nfileprivate func prepareNavigationItem() {\n    navigationItem.centerViews = [searchBar]\n}\n\n}\nextension FeedViewController: SearchBarDelegate {\n    @objc\n    func searchBar(searchBar: SearchBar, didClear textField: UITextField, with text: String?) {\n}\n\n@objc\nfunc searchBar(searchBar: SearchBar, didChange textField: UITextField, with text: String?) {\n\n}\n\n}\nextension FeedViewController: UITextFieldDelegate {\n    @objc\n    open func textFieldShouldReturn(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool {\n        textField.resignFirstResponder()\n        return true\n    }\n}\n``. I am not sure exactly what the issue is. You can have the SearchBar in the NavigationBar from any view controller. Just add it to the correctnavigationItem, or update that item when in that tab. So when in the SearchViewController, you can update thenavigationItemof theTabBar, then remove it when necessary. The other option, is to use the SnackBarController itself and embed the TabBarController. Why exactly do you need the NavigationController in this case if you are using a TabBarController? This will effect how you set this all up. . No worries :) All the best!. The issue here is thehitTestthat is calculating where you clicked. TheFABMenuis a subview of theToolbarand then the FABMenuItems are a subview of theFABButton. ThehitTestwill not register. Let's move this to [Gitter Material](https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material). I can help you out there :). @joninsky No worries, let me take a look at your repo now. Thank you!. I tried your sample. You only need to set the class type for theUINavigationBartoNavigationBar`. That's it :) Best of luck and reach out whenever you need. Thank you!. No worries :) . @theolof lol, anything I can make more clear. I'd be happy to rewrite it :) \n@WrathChaos thank you :) Can you share some sample code, or a sample project ? Thank you!. Hi @WrathChaos I haven't heard from you in regards to any sample code, so I will close this issue, please reopen if you need any further help. @talkabhishek Thank you for your response. . @fredbombadil We are redoing the site and launching it very soon. So it has been taken down, sorry. That said, what setup are you trying to do, I can help you. Thank you! Let's chat on Material Gitter. . Sorry for any delay. I'll have a response and fix for this shortly. As well, please follow this https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/702 as it will have the same solution. Thank you!. I believe you are talking about creating themes for Material? We have a Theme Feature Request for this. Please follow that issue, and if I am not correct in my thinking, please reopen this issue and describe further. Thank you!. Hey :)\nYou will need to adjust the height of the TextField with a slight top offset, and increase the height of the UITableViewCell to accommodate it. At the current moment, the height of the TextField.placeholderLabel is not included in the intrinsic height of the TextField. If you have any further questions, or need any help, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Hey, yes this is intentional. Apple says that a ui control should not fire its delegation methods when not initiated by a user. If you are programmatically executing code, you should be able to trigger the correct functionality, or add a selector and target to the FABMenuItem.fabButton. If you need, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Have you tried including this library? AVFoundation ? Are you using the Capture component in Material?. Yes, I have seen issues like this go away once the user's DerivedData directory is deleted and all is cleared. Something could be stale, which is causing this issue. Would you mind trying to clean everything up and deleting the user's DerivedData directory?. Not sure then. I don't use Carthage. Can you send me a sample project that I can try reproducing this with?. Awesome, thank you! . I am not sure what you mean by triggers. Please describe further. . No worries :). What version of Xcode are you using, and what version of Material are you using?\n. Please find an update for Xcode 8.3 in Material 2.6.1. If you need, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Great :) Happy all has worked out. Thank you!. Hmm... Can you show me a visual of this?. Hey, I haven't heard from you, when you get a chance, please provide a visual of the issue and the version of Material that you are using, and reopen the issue then :) Thank you!. True, but remember I am not calling layoutSubviews external to the class itself. Meaning, I am not doing this: textField.layoutSubviews(), which is not a good idea. I'll run some tests and see if there is an improvement I can make in this area :) \nCalling it in becomeFirstResponder is because of the change in layout that is needed if one triggers becomeFirstResponder when initially loading a TextField.  I think this was a really good investigation on your behalf, and I will look through today for improvements. Any further suggestions and questions are always welcome, thank you!. Initially I made those changes and tested all the projects. It caused some issues, so there is another method to achieve your suggestion, which I will do on my flight tomorrow. Personally, I don't see an issue with calling it internally, but I don't know everything and I can make an update from your suggestion :) Thanks for submitting this. . Great question, the functionality was removed to simplify the TextView as it was causing issues with scrollable text. TextView has multi line support, using clipsToBounds = false, bugs out. If you have any suggestions, I'd be happy to discuss them. Please reopen the issue if needed. . I am away until this evening, I can help you then :) . Your setup sounds like it is trying to combine more than one idea. So I am slightly confused, but from your issue's title \"How to call pushViewController in NavigationDrawerController\" - the code to call pushViewController from the NavigationDrawerController where the NavigationDrawerController.rootViewController is a NavigationController do this:\nswift\n(navigationDrawerController?.rootViewController as? NavigationController)?.pushViewController(MyViewController(), animated: true)\nIf you have any further issues or questions, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you :). Hey! You are doing it the correct way. If you would like them all to be in one view controller, you can take the components from the controllers and put them together yourself within a single view controller. For example SnackbarController, you could use the Snackbar and construct some of its features yourself that only the controller offers This is beneficial when you have certain reworks to animations, or other customized parts that you would like to do and not alter Material itself. A good way to organize your code, would be to subclass the controllers and put the relevant code setup within them for each component. \nIf you need, please reopen or create a new issue :) All the best!\nAs for any screen flickering issues, make an issue for it and describe what is happening :) Thank you!. @litunny Happy to help :) \nI am not sure I fully understand what you are asking. Are you asking how to reuse the code? Or how to add more controllers to the code above?. Another way you could do this is by using a Bar and setting the views to the rightViews, or really any side and then placing the Bar in the position you would like. . @johndpope You mean Expansion Panels ? If so, this is good, I will probably want to add these soon, they are quite useful. Thanks! \nThere are a bunch of new features coming. I am working on a way to help make the process of creating new components much easier and faster. Thank you for your support! . Yes, I have a prototype for a PopMenu. I am almost done the latest rebuild of the PageTabBarController, now being called TabMenuController. Once that is done, the PopMenu will probably be one of the next on the list to complete, alongside the BottomSheetController :). Hey :)\nHave you thought of running the action as an async call on the main thread? That might be helpful. Other than that, a delay seems like a reasonable approach based on what you are describing. If you would like, please reopen or create a new issue. I think a better place to have this discussion is on Material Gitter. There we can chat about different approaches to these types of issues :) . Hey, checkout the FABMenu Sample Project. The Menu is now called the FABMenu and has some upgraded features. All the best!. I am not sure what you are asking? Are you asking if you can combine them? If so, the answer is yes. Please update your question for more help and feel free to reopen the issue :) Thank you!. @tharhtet Okay, the PageTabBarController is being updated with a new component called PageMenuController. Once that is released, you can try it out and it should resolve your issue. . I can take a look and see how much work it would take. I'll post back to this issue in a couple days with my findings, and thank you :). Hey! So I wouldn't have the time to manage this on my own. If you or anyone else would want to help, I would consider it more. I will close the issue for now. Thank you for sharing this wonderful idea. All the best!. @delort how so?. @markst  You shouldn't need to override the function you are specifying. Also, there are delegation calls you can tap into:\n```swift\n@objc(TabBarDelegate)\npublic protocol TabBarDelegate {\n    /*\n     A delegation method that is executed when the button will trigger the\n     animation to the next tab.\n     - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n     - Parameter button: A UIButton.\n     /\n    @objc\n    optional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, willSelect button: UIButton)\n/**\n A delegation method that is executed when the button did complete the\n animation to the next tab.\n - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n - Parameter button: A UIButton.\n */\n@objc\noptional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, didSelect button: UIButton)\n\n}\n```\nGive those a try, plus the other recommendations above and if you still have an issue, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you!. @markst Your delegate is a function call, you could make a reusable function within there that you can trigger?. Can you share your code setup? There may be an issue with the extended layout value. If I can replicate the issue, it might be a matter of a configuration to help you out. . I haven't heard from you, so if you need help, please reopen this issue. Thank you :). The PageTabBarController is being replaced by a new component PageMenuController that is near completion. So this will be replaced. I am going to leave this up until I release the component, and make sure to make the intention of the code more clear in this area. Thank you!. This has now been fixed and will be added to the next release. Thank you!. This component has now been updated in Material 2.8.0. Features like swiping have not been included in 2.8.0, and will be included in a following release. The overall TabsController adds stability and scrollable Tabs. I am closing this issue and thank you for your patience. . Thank you for sharing. It seems that when two view controllers are set, there is a crash, at least in the sample project. In the next release, there is a new controller, PageMenuController coming out to replace the PageTabBarController. So the fix will be ready then. Shouldn't be much longer, I am working out the final details. I will leave this issue up until the release. Thank you!. @PetresS Yes, this issue is fixed in development with the latest TabsController. Mind you, the component is not complete. It will be done shortly. . This component has now been updated in Material 2.8.0. Features like swiping have not been included in 2.8.0, and will be included in a following release. The overall TabsController adds stability and scrollable Tabs. I am closing this issue and thank you for your patience. . @PetresS Unfortunately not yet. It is getting there :) I am going to reopen the issue.. I am closing this feature request as there is a PR for it now: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1019. Hey! I am almost done the feature you are looking for. Here is the issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/642 that follows its progress. If you look in development, there is a new controller called PageMenuController, and it will provide this feature. I am going to close this issue as you can follow the other. Thank you :). Yes, set toolbarDisplay to .full and set isHidden to true for the toolbar. That should do it. All the best!. Thank you for sharing this. Can you send me a sample project. Setting everything up, I may do it differently, which may give different results. Thank you! \nYou can email it to support@cosmicmind.com . Thank you! I will take a look. . I ran your sample on my device and had zero issues. I think you need to update to Xcode 8.3.* as I have updated Material to use that version. Try and let me know. Thank you!. @viral-etymon great, let me know. If you have any further issues with this, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. @viral-etymon Can you send me a sample app and then I will follow your steps, as well, please update to the latest. Thank you! . @viral-etymon I am able to see the issue, I believe I may know what it is, will see if I can spot the issue or make a fix. Thank you!. @viral-etymon Sorry, my mistake, I mixed up issues. I will verify this. Thank you!. @viral-etymon The link to your sample does not work. . @viral-etymon I am testing the issue on an iPhone 6+ and I am not seeing anything wrong with the NavigationBar. Are you testing on a device or simulator?. I still cannot reproduce this issue. Can you try and not use Storyboards as a test?. @markst yes that is correct, contentEdgeInsets is the general property for all components to adjust the padding. LayoutInsets is to adjust he entire component in its parent view bounds. If you need any further help, please let me know. I am closing this issue for now. Thank you!. Hey, thank you! There is not a direct way to do this in Material at the moment. That said, give me a couple days and let me see what I can think of. I am in the middle of adding updates to the Motion (animation) portion of Material, so maybe I can do something here with scroll techniques. I know there has been a feature request for it. Check in soon if you don't hear from me by Wednesday of next week. Thank you!. @robforsythe Thank you for following up. I am still looking into it. Had a few other items pop up before I could dive fully into this. That said, have you taken a look at this: https://www.natashatherobot.com/navigation-bar-interactions-ios8/ ?. @robforsythe So at this point, the only options would be to use the native iOS scroll techniques. There is a noted feature request to make this more simple. I am going to close the issue for now, and hopefully you can help provide some insight after you tryout the iOS 8+ updates from Apple. Soon enough I will be working on this myself as well :) Always feel free to create any issue and reach out with more questions and suggestions. All the best! . @chrisdhaan No worries, I am here to help. The video is unavailable. It might be because of where I am in the world, not sure. As for the flicker, have you set the UINavigationBar to NavigationBar? As well, if you can share a sample project, I should be able to help you. \nAll the best!. @chrisdhaan Thank you! What version of Material are you using and what device / simulator are testing on?. @chrisdhaan I am able to see the issue, I believe I may know what it is, will see if I can spot the issue or make a fix. Thank you!. @chrisdhaan are the devices you are testing on happening only on the simulator? I tried your sample on my iPhone 6s and the issue is not there.. @chrisdhaan No worries :) I am happy you pointed it out. Currently I am making some really nice updates to Material and when I get to the NavigationController, I will be testing on simulators as well. Generally, I found that the simulators are not reliable at all, especially for animation work. All the best and never hesitate to reach out, I am here to help. All the best!. I am guessing this was closed because you solved the problem?. Can you give more details? Which tab bar style are you using? BottomNavigationController, PageTabBarController, an independent TabBar? As well, what part of the animation, the line, the fade, etc... please describe a bit more. Thank you!. I can't seem to find one. That said, there is a BottomNavigationController that you may be able to utilize. There is a new component coming out called the TabsController which will allow you to do what you are looking for. The current PageTabBarController is using a UIPageViewController, which is accessible through the PageTabBarController.pageViewController property. You may be able to find a setting in there. I looked online and was not able to find anything. If you need any further help, let me know. All the best! . According to Apple, controls should only call their delegation methods when triggered by a user interaction. If you need the delegation call to be called somewhere in your programmatic steps, then place the delegation call in a handler function and call that where and when needed. Hope that helps and please reopen the issue if you need :) . Hey, \nIn any view controller once it appears, after viewDidAppear is called, you can use the navigationDrawerController optional property, so long as the view controller is a child view in the view hierarchy. Once calling it, you can then call the toggleLeftView function. For example:\nswift\nopen override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    navigationDrawerController?.toggleLeftView()\n}\nTake a look at the NavigationDrawerController Sample Project to learn more. \nAs for the top constraint, what do you mean exactly? You can easily add any constraint you would like to the left/right view controllers you add to the NavigationDrawerController. \nIf you need any further help, let me know :) All the best!. Try using the public convenience init(image: UIImage?, tintColor: UIColor = Color.blue.base) initializer. For the button, if the image is exactly 24 x 24 than it will appear bigger, because all the icons in Material have space included in their image, based on the Material Design Icons from Google. Let me know how it works out and if you need any further help, reopen the issue. Thank you! \nAnother issue with your image could be that you need to use the image!.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal) to allow your code to change the color. So you would want to do this: \nswift\ndeleteButton = IconButton(image: UIImage(named: \"Trash\")!.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal)). Try this:\nswift\ndeleteButton = IconButton(image: UIImage(named: \"Trash\")!.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal)). Can you share the code where you are trying to change this? As well, what version of Material and device are you using?. @Recouse I don't see the tinting code. Can you share that as well?. @Recouse  It seems like you are facing two issues, this and https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/775. May you send a sample with both your issues and I can look into them? Thank you! Send it to support@cosmicmind.com. @Recouse thank you, I will take a look. . @Recouse I am not sure I got the email, can you try and send it again? Please and thank you!. At the current moment I have no plan for that. If you want to kick it off and then work with me on it, I'd be happy to do that. Reopen the issue if you would like to work on it with me and have something to get it going :) Thank you!. Thank you :) Can you explain more about when you are launching the camera? Possibly provide a sample project, version of Material you are using, and the device you are testing on?. I have been looking into it, and it looks like the camera starts out at the back because on iPhones it wasn't always guaranteed that the device would have a camera in the front. Why not start the camera in the background when the app opens? Only on the initial launch of your app would it be the slowest as you will need permission from the user to use the camera. One of my next areas of focus is to rewrite the camera component to handle its short comings and I will be adding new features. I will be able to investigate further then. If you need any further help, please reopen the issue. \nThank you! :). Somewhere in your project you are referencing a cell identifier that is either not set correctly, or not registered in the correct sequence. Please provide a sample project, or some code I can reference. Once you do that, please reopen the issue :) Thank you!. Sorry, I missed that: \nYou need to register your identifier when using UITableView cells. \nswift\ntableView.register(MyTableViewCell1.self, forCellReuseIdentifier: \"cell1\")\nand in your code here:\n```swift\noverride func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {\n    if (indexPath.section == 0) {\n        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"cell1\", for: indexPath) as! MyTableViewCell1\n\n        cell.lblText1?.text = \"Item \\(indexPath.startIndex)\"\n        cell.lblText2?.text = \"\\(indexPath.section)\"\n\n        return cell\n    }\n    else\n        if (indexPath.section == 1) {\n            let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"cell2\", for: indexPath) as UITableViewCell\n            return cell\n        }\n        else\n            if (indexPath.section == 2) {\n                let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"cell3\", for: indexPath) as UITableViewCell\n                return cell\n            }\n\n    return UITableViewCell()\n}\n\n```\nYou are using identifiers \"cell1\", \"cell2\", \"cell3\" when they are not registered. Also, in your storyboard project, you need to set the UITableView to TableView. \nHope that helps :). Registering your cell classes is where the issue is arising. As for the Storyboard, in your Main storyboard, where you set the UITableView, give it a custom class name TableView. . I don't use storyboards at all, so the advice I will give you will surround programmatic solutions. I will take a look at your other sample later today. . Hey, sorry, this slipped my mind and I didn't get a chance to look at it. Are you still facing an issue?. I am reopening this issue for you. @melcug . The PageTabBarController has been replaced with the TabsController. Please use that new controller and if the issue persists reopen this issue. Thank you :). The feature to make this happen has not been made yet. It will shortly, it is called scroll techniques. I have it noted to make this feature. Thank you!. Thank you, I will add this as a feature request and will post it in the next release. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. You will need to send me a sample or visual with Material version number and device you are testing on. When you got that ready, please reopen the issue. \nThank you :). Hey, not sure exactly what is going on here. Can you send a sample project to support@cosmicmind.com or paste it to this issue? \nThank you :). Please reopen this issue once you have more for me to work with. Thank you and all the best!. Works like a charm buddy. I will merge this into development. Thank you!. I don't see anything wrong with it. The user has not triggered the event. Maybe you can describe a scenario to better demonstrate how it is behaving incorrectly. Please reopen the issue when you do :) Thank you!. I believe it is because this is enabled: isTapToExposeEnabled. Try setting that to false. If the issue persists, please reopen the issue :) Thank you!. Let me investigate this. I can do the investigation once I am done the latest animation and text view changes. So I will queue this up. . The Capture API is getting completely revamped and is no longer in the Material release branch. So I am going to make a note of this and close it for now. Thank you!. Thank you :) I will take a look. . Hey, sorry I fell completely behind on this issue. If it is still an issue, please reopen it, and I will be glad to help. Sorry for the inconvenience. . I will give this a look. I noticed your PR fixing the issue as well. Thank you :). This component has now been updated in Material 2.8.0. Features like swiping have not been included in 2.8.0, and will be included in a following release. The overall TabsController adds stability and scrollable Tabs. I am closing this issue and thank you for your patience. . @okankocyigit good point to look into. I am almost done the new animation additions, which has been quite the amount of work. Once I am done that, I will have my attention on this. Thank you for your patience :). Thank you!. Should this be opened or closed?. @wsrobins any issues left? Thank you for the PR :). @wsrobins Thank you :) Yes, I am currently rewriting the entire animation portion and then extending it to all the components for Material 3. I am also adding an AR component based on iOS 11's release. I will be putting a plan together asking for contributions once the animation portion is done. . @jojonarte Thank you for sharing this. I plan to rewrite the Capture component. It is still using the initial write, and a lot has been learned since then, but has not been updated yet. If you continue to find issues, please send them my way :) . I am going to close this issue, as you found a solution for the problem, and I have made the update in the development branch, which will be ready for release shortly. Thank you! :) Your help is very much appreciated. . I am currently working on Material 3. I will have Swift 4.0 in there. It will take a few days to get it going, so until then I will keep this up :) . @ssrballin Good question. I am not setting a date, but I am already working on it, making small releases in the 2.* branch. . Adding issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/861. Adding issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/783. Hi @LukA888 Would it be possible to send me a slimmed down sample project with the issues? Thank you! :) . @LukA888 The NavigationController is a tricky view controller in embedded child view controller. Have you tried the ToolbarController?. I haven't heard back from you. When you are ready to continue the discussion, please reopen the issue. Thank you :) . Can you elaborate? By doing it as in the example, does the example work? If so, what are the differences?. Have you set in Storyboards the class NavigationBar ?. \n. And you have done the same for the NavigationController ?. May you show me the code you are using to set the items?. Nice :) Let's close this up. . This is a player issue. The files you record should be moved to a safe location once you receive them. They are more or less temporary when provided by Material. Try moving them to a folder in the shared application space, or documents directory, and if the issue still persists, reopen this issue. I am  almost ready to get back to the Capture component for a rewrite, and I will be more helpful then. . It is not actually uneven, it is that the word sizes are different. The buttons themselves are even. In the scrollable version of the TabBar, this has been solved. It is within the development branch, so for this version there is not much I can offer, without rewriting some code within Material. If you cannot find another alternative before I release the next Material version with this update, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. Hey :) \nYou need to flip the order of the view controller hierarchy. \n```swift\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n        let rootViewController = RootViewController()\n        let appNavigationController = AppNavigationController(rootViewController: rootViewController)\n        let leftViewController = LeftViewController()\n    let appNavDrawerController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: appNavigationController, leftViewController: leftViewController)\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = appNavDrawerController\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n```\nThank should fix it. . No I didn't see that. Can you send me the sample you are working from?. Ah, then yes I tried it, but didn't see the issue. Let me see, btw, I am guessing you recorded the bug on the simulator, if so, which one, and have you tried a device?. Anytime :) I am always excited to get feedback. I am going to close this, as simulator issues are usually a result of the simulator. As long as it works on a device, I will dive into the issue. Thanks again!. Btw, the simulator issue is probably because you are swiping fast and and the cursor goes off the simulator, so the animation is cut. . @shemchavez excellent :) Thank you!. @adeesh You would need to send me a sample so I can reproduce this issue. It may be because the shadow animations are set / not set correctly. Can you send a sample to support@cosmicmind.com. Thank you!. Hey, I have not heard from you, so when you are ready, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. Thank you for sharing this. Are you using storyboards?. Then you would need to share a sample project with me that reproduces the issue. I am not getting any issues with the NavigationBar at the moment. Would you be able to do that?. You cannot add it to the viewDidLoad of the view controller, because the optional navigationController property has not been set. You will need to do it in a subclass of the NavigationController within the prepare statement, or in the viewWillAppear method of the view controller, which will have the navigationController property set. \nLet me know how that works out. . Generally, people make the same mistake. So you are probably correct about the code. Hopefully it is as simple as the recommendation I made. either way, we will figure it out. Thank you, and let me know how it turns out. . Yeah everything is correct. Remove the color from the divider line, you are not looking at a shadow, you are looking at the navigationBar.dividerColor being set. . In this case that won't make sense, since a developer would need to manage multiple variables to set the depth. By setting it to .none it is clear that the depth will be gone. What really needs to exist is documentation that outlines this. I believe that is the best approach :) I am working on documentation for Material 3 and the latest updates. I will be sure to include this. Sorry for the inconvenience. . I haven't updated Material for Xcode 9 yet. I will need to look into that. I will keep this up and get back to you with a solution once I move Material to Xcode 9. . I have made an adjustment for this, now it centers correctly. That said iOS 11 introduces a new view container within the hierarchy. So I am working out that last issue. . This should be solved now. Thank you! :). Hey, thank you for sharing this. Funny enough, I was working on a similar issue when combining these two components. I will try your code later today, does it solve the issue?. :) I will notify you once I have a solution. I am working on this particular issue in my work at the moment, so your timing is impeccable. . I am actually working on an Advanced sample pack for all the updates I have been doing and this is in there. So you are right on point. . Try subclassing the NavigationController and setting the overall values you would like in there. \n```swift\nclass AppNavigationController: NavigationController {\n    open override func prepare() {\n        super.prepare()\n        guard let v = navigationBar as? NavigationBar else {\n            return\n        }\n    v.depthPreset = .none\n    v.dividerColor = Color.grey.lighten3\n}\n\n}\n```\nIf you need any further help, feel free to reopen the issue. Thank you!. Sweet :). You would need to handle changes in the panel view controllers by recalculating the view hierarchy when the view will layout. For example: \nswift\nopen override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {\n        super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()\n        layoutColorChoicesView()\n        layoutColorCollectionView()\n    }\nIf you need further help, please reopen the issue. Thank you! . Nice! I will take a look at this over the weekend. Thank you!. Thank you!. This is better as a StackOverflow question. Not sure what AEConsole is and how it relates to Material. All the best :). Hey, I see that you have the 3 classes, are you looking for the best way to connect these 3 components? What is your desired flow between these components?. Can you share how you are launching these controllers? . So you would basically want to setup your AppDelegate like so: \n```swift\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\n\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n    let bottomNavigationController = BottomNavigationController(viewControllers: [PhotoViewController(), VideoViewController(), AudioViewController(), RemindersViewController(), SearchViewController()])\n\n    let leftViewController = LeftViewController()\n    let rightViewController = RightViewController()\n\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = NavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: bottomNavigationController, leftViewController: leftViewController, rightViewController: rightViewController)\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n}\n```\nIf you need any further help, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. You want the size of the font to get smaller? It already shrinks to fit proportionally. If you start changing that, the component may not animate with the correct look and feel. Can you elaborate more on what you are trying to accomplish, possibly include a visual representation?. As I mentioned, it should be smaller by default. Can you share a sample project reproducing this issue? . Maybe, I need to see a reproducible sample in order to give correct feedback. . I am going to close this issue for now. Once you have a reproducible project, please send it to support@cosmicmind.com :) Thank you!. Hey, resizing the frame in the prepare function is the correct place to do it :) Also, there are height presets that you can choose from, which may have a value that you would like to use:\nswift\n@objc(HeightPreset)\npublic enum HeightPreset: Int {\n    case none = 0\n    case tiny = 20\n    case xsmall = 28\n    case small = 36\n    case `default` = 44\n    case normal = 49\n    case medium = 52\n    case large = 60\n    case xlarge = 68\n    case xxlarge = 104\n}\nWas that your question?. Hi, I haven't heard from you. If you need, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. Great! Anytime :). Hey :) Welcome to iOS and Material. Please use the Gitter Material channel to get help for this issue. I will be available to help you. . Thank you! I will take a look at see what's happening. . I am not able to get that sample simulator, so I cannot reproduce your issue. As well, we would need to confirm the findings on a device. Simulators are not reliable. Can you think of an approach going forward to test this? The CPU hitting 100% and freezing the app sounds really weird for that behavior, especially since you are using all of Apple's APIs. Adding a view to a PageTabBarItem is equivalent to adding a view to a UIButton. If you can give me more to work with, I'd be happy to continue investigating. Please reopen the issue if you need :) Thank you!. Hey, there is a textInsetproperty. Give that a try, and if you need, please reopen the issue :) . Hey, I made a fix for this in development. I am going to release a new version of Material with it in the next few days. . You can find a fix for this in Material 2.7.0 :). Sounds good :) All the best!. So this is really an iOS issue not a Material issue. That said, if you go to the Gitter Material channel, I can help you there :). This issue is combined in a few others. The PageTabBar is being replaced within a couple releases. The TabsController will replace it and is already working as a prototype, but not ready for production. It will have the feature you are looking for then. The current issue is more of a limitation that is imposed by the base UIPageViewController provided by Apple. Watch the updates coming and you will have the feature really soon. Thank you!. @wlching this is a great idea in general. Would you create a feature request for this idea? Then I can update you on its release. I have a release coming up, so this may be able to squeeze in there. . Please setup a sample project with the issue and let's move this to the Gitter Material channel :). Hey :)\nYou will need to upgrade a few things. Firstly, move to Xcode 8.3.* if you can, as that will save you upgrade time in general. If that is not possible, then make sure you have upgraded CocoaPods to the latest. Make sure to upgrade Material to the latest, and then clear your pod cache and User Derived directory in Xcode. If you need, connect on the Gitter Material channel and I can help you further. All the best!. I believe you can access it through the placeholderLabel. If not, please reopen the issue :) . Okay, I understand. Let's reopen this as a feature request. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Excellent, thank you! I will take a look at this. . The PageTabBarController has been updated with a new TabsController. This should fix your issue. Thank you!. Thank you for sharing this. I have a fix for this in development, and added features to hide, change, and manipulate the back button. I will leave the issue up and notify you once I have released Material 2.7.0. . In the meantime, have you tried using the ToolbarController for the login screen and then a NavigationController for the page you are creating. This will make it that you actually don't have a back state, and will not need to hide the back button. An idea for you as a workaround for now. . Yes, I have already submit an app with the development branch, Material Colors. All is fine. I am mainly working on documentation right now. As for accessing the ToolbarController, after the viewWillAppear message, you can call the toolbarController optional property that accesses the parent ToolbarController. You can either change the rootViewController with the transition helper function, or you can present a new UIViewController using the present function. I am going to close this issue, and if you need, please reopen it :). Thank you for sharing this. Can you send a sample project over?. Hey, I have not heard from you, so I will close this issue, and if you need, please reopen it. Thank you!. @thatmarcel Please send me a reproducible project to support@cosmicmind.com and I will be happy to help. Thank you!. It looks like you are merging the Material development branch to Material master. If you can fix this PR up and show me the clear change, I would be happy to accept it :) Thank you!. It has been closed. To create a feature request, go to issues and create a new one. Use the label feature request. That's it :). Hey, I wouldn't use the development branch right now. I am making a release after I finish the transition documentation. Then I will be making another release with the scrollable tab bar. Sorry I can't be any more help at this point. I will update this issue once it is out: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/642. . This was a good find. I made updates to Material and the sample to fix the issue. I will update this issue once I release it from the development branch. Shouldn't be long at all. . You can find a fix for this in Material 2.7.0 :). Hey @mzgnr, to get a back button you need to use a NavigationController, not ToolbarController. So it would look like this: \nswift\nlet pageTabBarController = AppPageTabbarController(viewControllers: [NewsViewController(), TransferVC(), DailySummaryVC()])\nlet navigationController = AppNavigationController(rootViewController: pageTabBarController)\nlet leftViewController = MenuController() \nwindow?.rootViewController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: navigationController, leftViewController: leftViewController)\nAnd you would call a transition like so: \nswift\ncloseNavigationDrawer()\n(navigationDrawerController?.rootViewController as? NavigationController)?.pushViewController(pageTabBarController, animated: true)\nYou might need to tweak this a bit, but this is the general idea.\nIf you need any further help, reopen the issue :) Or go to Material Gitter\n. Make a sample project that shows a blank screen using this setup and we can go from there :). No worries. You should still send over a project if it is not working. I can take a look and confirm why, if it is related to Material. . Yeah of course @mzgnr :). @mzgnr Well viewWillAppear will always be called before the final render to screen, and viewDidAppear I believe coordinates with the final render to screen. Are you only seeing this in certain situations?. Well it is only ever called when the viewDidAppear. So it sounds correct. I am not understanding where the issue is. Please expand on your thoughts about this :). No worries, what version of Material are yo using that you have TabBarController in the code base?. If you are basing your work off the samples, all should be fine. Feel free to share a sample project with me, so I can better understand and help with your issue. Also, we should move this to the Material GItter channel :). Darn, I shouldn't have released that feature in this version. I will need to take that out now until it is ready. Thank you! I am going to close this issue, as the feature was accidentally released and will be removed now. . Thank you! Material 2.7.1 is available. . This is great :) I am working on the TabsController now and will take your changes and integrate them into my next release. . Thank you!. I am making a Swift 4 update shortly. Please follow this issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/773 Thank you!. Hey :) Have you set the \nswift\ncollectionView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = false\ncollectionView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = false\nproperties ?. Not necessarily. The scroll indicators show that the content is larger than the visible space. ScrollViews allow all directions and automatically find the direction once a scroll occurs and it needs to show your content. The only other scenario for scroll is when you set the direction manually. The visibility of the indicators can go on and off when first displayed and then no longer be shown if not needed. If you can send me a reproducible sample I will be able to investigate it further :). @gilthonweapps awesome I will take a look :). @gilthonweapps I will be working on this tomorrow if not tonight. Sorry for any delays :). I am looking more into your issue. I can verify it happens when using Motion. That said, I am not sure that it is actually Motion. It could be a symptom of custom animations being made with Apple's Animator API. I will keep investigating over the next couple days. A temporary workaround is to hide and show the indicators within the viewDidAppear and viewWillAppear methods. . @OrkhanAlikhanov this is on the high priority list. Will look more into it today. . @OrkhanAlikhanov Thank you!. So you should only use the NavigationController or ToolbarController in a screen setup like the one you are looking for. The NavigationController is a subclass of UINavigationController. So you can use it as you would normally use any navigation controller. When setting up the navigation controller items, you will want in each view controller that you are navigating to, to access the navigationItem properties. If you need any further help, please reopen or create a new issue :) Or use the Material Gitter chat, where I can help you further. . Material subclasses the UITextField found normally in UIKit. So everything should work as expected if you use the same methods. Have you tried this?. I am linking this issue to here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/818. As it is a feature request for text field masking. . Nice, I will put this in the queue of items. I like the idea of adding this to Material. . Not yet. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Instead of adding the Toolbar and Bar to the Card component, add them as subviews of the contentView. Then in code you can probably do something like this: \n```swift\ncard = Card()\ncard.contentView = UIView(...)\nlet toolbar = Toolbar()\ncard.contentView?.layout(toolbar).horizontally().top()\nlet bar = Bar()\ncard.contentView?.layout(bar).horizontally().bottom()\n```\nSomething like that. Give it a try, and if you need any further help, message me on Material Gitter :) All the best!. I will take a look, nice catch :). @comaxime For now, your solution looks great :) I am going to make a push now. All the best!. The Scrollable TabBar is available now. It will automatically detect if it needs to add the scrollable feature. . @wlching Yes, those features are coming :) I am making a nice update with those included. . For now there is the TabBarDelegate\n```swift\n// Material 2.9.0 (in development)\n@objc(TabBarDelegate)\npublic protocol TabBarDelegate {\n    /*\n     A delegation method that is executed when the tabItem will trigger the\n     animation to the next tab.\n     - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n     - Parameter tabItem: A TabItem.\n     /\n    @objc\n    optional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, willSelect tabItem: TabItem)\n/**\n A delegation method that is executed when the tabItem did complete the\n animation to the next tab.\n - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n - Parameter tabItem: A TabItem.\n */\n@objc\noptional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, didSelect tabItem: TabItem)\n\n}\n```\n```swift\n// Material 2.8.1 (in production)\n```swift\n@objc(TabBarDelegate)\npublic protocol TabBarDelegate {\n    /*\n     A delegation method that is executed when the button will trigger the\n     animation to the next tab.\n     - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n     - Parameter button: A UIButton.\n     /\n    @objc\n    optional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, willSelect button: UIButton)\n/**\n A delegation method that is executed when the button did complete the\n animation to the next tab.\n - Parameter tabBar: A TabBar.\n - Parameter button: A UIButton.\n */\n@objc\noptional func tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, didSelect button: UIButton)\n\n}\n```\nI am going to add more delegation calls for the next release, which is probably going to be ready in max a couple days. \n. You can now follow this issue, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/823, for a complete solution that is being currently worked on. Thank you!. Thank you, I will follow up on these feature requests. I know that generally the TabsController is not fully complete, but that is part of why I released it that way so I can get back notes. Thank you, these are great!. Adding to this issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/683. Adding to this issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/860. The features that will be worked on have been added in separate issues or released. I will make note of this checklist. This issue will be closed now :) Thank you!. @melcug  That is only ready as a prototype at the moment. . @markst why not use the selectedTabItem property?. @markst selectedIndex is different than selectedTabItem. Either way, if #860 is working for you, then let's go with the suggestion you made there. . @seubseub Yes, it will be out soon. . Nice, I will investigate this today :) Thank you!. Thank you for submitting this issue. It is now fixed. I will push an update now. . I will double check. . I cannot reproduce it. Are you sure you are using the latest? That said, if you can provide reproduction steps, that would be helpful. Thank you!. Hmmm... well I cannot reproduce this within Material, you would have to setup a sample project with another library and demonstrate how Material breaks. Then I would be happy to help out. . I need a sample project that creates this issue. As well, you shouldn't need to set this: \ntabBar.scrollView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = false\ntabBar.scrollView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = false\nThey should already be set. . No worries :) . Great question :) I am adding it again. I only need to rework it so that it is not causing any issues with inclusion for those that do not want it. If you need, please feel free to reach out on Material Gitter to discuss more. All the best!. Hey :) Welcome to iOS and Material. \nThis is what you Podfile:\n```bash\nUncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project\nplatform :ios, '9.0'\ntarget 'firstApp' do\n  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks\n  use_frameworks!\n# Pods for firstApp\npod 'Material', '~> 2.0'\nend\n```\nLet me know how it turns out. Thank you!. If you have any further trouble, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. What version of CocoaPods are you using? . Okay, send me your project please, I want to try and install it :). So it looks like your CocoaPods is acting up. Please send me the project you are trying to setup, and I will see what happens on my end :). Did you open the workspace or the project folder? Because it just worked for me. You need to open the workspace :). So it is working now? If not, please reopen the issue :) All the best!. Nice, thank you. I will take your code as a PR and add it to the next release :) Awesome catch. . Great catch :). You can now find a fix for this in Material 2.10.1. Thank you!. The .auto behaviour already exists: It is motionTransitionType = .autoReverse(presenting: .slide(direction: .left)). That said, I will need to configure it to handle the case when moving between all directions. Good suggestion :). Hey :) This has been added to Material 2.10.0. Thank you!. I will double check this, I made adjustments to fix the other issue, and this may have already been fixed in the process.. Please try Material 2.9.1 for a fix to this issue. Thank you!. You can write this now with the latest Material 2.9.* version. \nswift\ntabsController?.tabBar.select(at: 1)\nand the select feature has not yet been implemented. I will make that update most likely tomorrow. Thank you!. You can now find a fix for this in Material 2.10.1.\nUse:\nswift\ntabsController?.select(at: 1)\nThank you!. Excellent, thank you! I am going to give this a thorough look through soon. I have been working on a documentation portal for the past couple weeks. This is in the queue and thank you!. I will review it over the weekend :) @madasamys I am now fully focused on Material 3 and adding in the new features. . There is a new PR to add this feature that is up to date. I am going to close this. Thank you for submitting this PR! https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1130. No worries. I have already started prototyping this sometime ago. I will add this to the feature list and put it in queue for development. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. At the current moment I am not support Xcode 9 and Swift 4. That said, send me a project reproducing the issue, and I can take a look :). @a88zach Thank you :)\n@james-ingold I will be preparing a branch for Swift 4 and Xcode 9 this week. At that point I will publish a solution to the issue. Thank you!. Hey, checkout this commit https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/6b0bd134d458a1b3250985bf920cac952b799e9a from the development branch :). @chanonly123 I think there is a better approach to what you are trying to do. Would you please explain your goal with this code? . The Card already inherits from the PulseView. So the pulse effect is already there. Just set the pulseAnimation property. To set the pulse effect is not the best idea as it adds two layers to each view making it an expensive addition. This is why it is isolated to its own view type. Most major components inherit or implement the pulse effect in the optimal way. . Let's move this issue to Material GItter. As this is more of a conversation for there :). hmmm... I will have to take a look at this. Thank you, it is now in the queue. . This is now fixed in Material 2.16.3. Thank you!. Hey, welcome to iOS and Material. So there are basically two approaches you can take. The first approach is to create the view controller as you did, then pass that controller to the initializer for the NavigationDrawerController. The second option is to pass in the view controller to the NavigationDrawerController without initializing the data, and then in your view controller itself, you implement a function being called in the viewWillAppear or viewDidAppear function that loads your data. Both options have benefits and downfalls. It depends on how you like to organize your data being passed to your view controllers. Let me know if you need any further help, we can chat on Material Gitter. . You will need to describe more than this please. . hmmm... okay, I will take a look. Thanks.. I am not sure if this is an issue or just an incorrect use of the Switch control. If there is an issue here to solve, please reopen this. Thank you!. I see, okay I have reopened the issue and will run the sample project and see what's up. Thanks for the feedback :). Can someone test this commit, who has been facing this issue: 4433996f6f89bce19b11f917182d89f4877b5077, thank you!. Cool, so unless there is further need to adjust the sizing, I am going to close this issue and the next release will include this fix. Thank you!. It was in, but I removed it as it wasn't fully complete. I needed to update Motion and some other components before I had time to fully make this. I added this to the feature list. I will need it in an app I am working on, so it will most likely be out very soon. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Thank you, I will investigate this :). Thank you! This is very helpful. . @OrkhanAlikhanov We should confirm this as well. If it is not an issue, let's close it. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov Great! Thank you!\n@amitrajmodi if you are still facing this issue, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. Let's discuss this in Material Gitter as there isn't an issue here. There is a conflict because of two libraries. . Yes, that is a great reason. So in that case, let's leave a fix for this. I was hoping to discuss what should be done when this situation arises? As it will probably again on another property. . When are you calling this function? Can you send me a sample with this and I will take a look?. Yeah, I can see it is not working. Weird, well I shall take a look :). Hey, so you need to call becomeFirstResponder() when the view controller has appeared, like so: \nswift\nopen override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n        searchBar.textField.becomeFirstResponder()\n    }\n:) All the best!. No worries :) I am happy to help. . Nice! I am going to look at this later today... I really appreciate this :). Merged :) Thank you! . Very impressive, I will take a look at this as soon as possible today :) Thank you!. Can you share your code? Thank you! . You are correct, there is a bug here. Also, there shouldn't be a placeholderActiveColor property, as TextView doesn't act as TextField just yet. I am going to make an update and release this within a couple hours. Thank you!. Please find a fix for this in Material 2.10.2. Use the textView.placeholderColor property. Thank you for sharing the issue :). I'll expand the Chips to support this, it is a very useful feature :) Thank you!. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Thank you! This is great :). The issue may be that you need to set the contentSize of the scroll view. Give it a try and if you need further help, reopen the issue. Thank you! Also, this kind of question is more appropriate for Material Gitter. . Anytime buddy :). This issue is not clear. Please revise it and then reopen the issue, thank you!. Please send over a sample project demonstrating the issue. I still don't get what you are describing. Thank you!. I will take a look tomorrow :). @Ccmi I will be looking at it today. I had fallen way behind due to work, sorry about any delay. . I believe I know where the issue is :). I will be working on this issue and preparing a release for this week. Thank you!. This is a linked issue: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/issues/16. Please give Motion 1.3.0 a try. If the issue persists, please reopen it. Thank you!. Hey, sorry for my late reply. I will need a reproducible project so I can see what is happening. Would you be able to send one? Thank you!. Hey, I haven't heard from you. If you need, please reopen this issue and I will be happy to help out. Thank you :). We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Thank you for sharing this, I will reproduce the issue and push a fix :). Please find a fix for this in Material 2.10.2. Thank you for sharing the issue :). This was a great catch, and a fix has been made and will be released within 30 minutes. Thank you :). The issue has been fixed and an update will be posted within 30 minutes. Thank you :). @paraschodavadiya it should be fine, please pull the latest. Thank you!. @ismaPM There isn't a buttons property. Maybe that is the issue. It is called tabItems now. . @atistank great catch, please take a look at the latest TabBar sample for an updated version :) . I can make a TabsControllerDelegate for you now. There should be one and this would be beneficial for everyone. Can you suggest what other items you may like in that delegate before I make it?. Cool, I will add some basic insight. Thanks, this will be done within the next couple hours. . In Material 2.10.1 you can now use the following delegation methods: \n```swift\n@objc(TabsControllerDelegate)\npublic protocol TabsControllerDelegate {\n    /*\n     A delegation method that is executed to determine if the TabsController should\n     transition to the next view controller.\n     - Parameter tabBar: A TabsController.\n     - Parameter tabItem: A TabItem.\n     - Returns: A Boolean.\n     /\n    @objc\n    optional func tabsController(tabsController: TabsController, shouldSelect viewController: UIViewController) -> Bool\n/**\n A delegation method that is executed when the view controller will transitioned to.\n - Parameter tabsController: A TabsController.\n - Parameter viewController: A UIViewController.\n */\n@objc\noptional func tabsController(tabsController: TabsController, willSelect viewController: UIViewController)\n\n/**\n A delegation method that is executed when the view controller has been transitioned to.\n - Parameter tabsController: A TabsController.\n - Parameter viewController: A UIViewController.\n */\n@objc\noptional func tabsController(tabsController: TabsController, didSelect viewController: UIViewController)\n\n}\n```\nThank you!. Nice I shall try that out :) Thank you!. I can add this with the delegation calls. . Please find this feature available in the latest Material 2.12.0 release. \nExample: \nswift\ntabBar.setColor(Color.grey.base, for: .normal)\ntabBar.setColor(Color.blue.base, for: .selected)\nThank you @mohpor for the initial version, it really helped with laying down the groundwork :). @markst yeah, we can make that adjustment. . Adding this suggestion https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/916#issuecomment-337786413. @markst I opted out of using UIControlState as it has more states than necessary for managing the tab items. That said, the latest interface for colors looks like this: \n```swift\ntabBar.setLineColor(Color.orange.base, for: .selected)\ntabBar.setTabItemsColor(Color.grey.base, for: .normal)\ntabBar.setTabItemsColor(Color.purple.base, for: .selected)\ntabBar.setTabItemsColor(Color.green.base, for: .highlighted)\n```\nThis is available in Material 2.12.2.. Are you using Storyboards? If so, set the class name to NavigationBar where appropriate. . Okay, I haven't updated Material for Xcode 9. So I will add this issue to that Feature Request and get back to you ASAP :). I am preparing Material for Xcode 9 and iOS 11. I will get back to you within a couple days. Most likely a release and update as well :). Can you test the development branch please?. @Ccmi Hey, checkout this commit https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/6b0bd134d458a1b3250985bf920cac952b799e9a from the development branch :). I literally just pushed an update for Swift 4 to the development branch. I will still review this and see if there is anything I can merge in. Thanks for the PR :). Thanks buddy :) I truly appreciate the PR. . Great! Thank you. . Can you send a sample project with your setup? Thank you!. Hey, I haven't heard from you. If you need please reopen this issue :) Thank you!. Amazing! Thank you :). This has been added to wip-checkbox-radiobutton in order to keep the next release clean until this is ready. . A related PR https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/878. Hey! There are plans to release these components. Not in the next release though. This is the branch that this should be worked on: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/tree/wip-checkbox-radiobutton. I am going to rebase that branch and then merge this in :). Let's get this in within the next couple releases :). Try the development branch for now :) it has been updated. All the best :). https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/tree/development. Sorry about that. That is a commit that was PRed into the repo recently. It has not been groomed yet for the framework. Use this commit: 6b0bd134d458a1b3250985bf920cac952b799e9a. All the best!. Delegation methods are only fired when the user interacts with the application. You can utilize the callback available:\nswift\nopen func select(at index: Int, completion: ((TabItem) -> Void)? = nil) {\nIn general, delegates should only be fires when the user interacts with a control. . Hey, checkout this commit 6b0bd13 from the development branch :)\nI am releasing to the master branch by tomorrow :). It should be hidden when using an iPhone. Can you share your setup code for this, device, and branch that you are using for Material? . Are you using the latest development branch version? If so, can you send over a reproducible project. Also, I don't rely on simulators as they are buddy. This should be tested on a device. I await to hear from you :). Hey! I haven't heard from you. If you still face this issue, please reopen it. Thank you!. What version of Material are you using? Can you share you setup code?. Checkout this commit 6b0bd13 from the development branch :). It is the latest version for iOS 11 that I have pushed. So you can try and see if it corrects your issue. If not, I will take a look into the code :). By the end of the week, it should be in. Let me know if your issue persists. I will close the issue for now :). If you need Xcode 9 support, checkout this commit 6b0bd13 from the development branch :). Hey :)\nAre you using Xcode 9 with Swift 4, or using Xcode 8. with Swift 3.?. Cool, I can take a look a little later today. I think it would be better to move this conversation to Material Gitter. So please post the issue there and I will be happy to help :). It looks like you are trying to set a value that is read-only heightPreset.rawValue. If you would like to do what you are doing, try this: \nswift\nlet h = heightPreset.rawValue\nreturn h + spacing\nwhere appropriate. . Lol, I knew it looked familiar ;) Well, I am updating the sample today and over the weekend. So You should have this available shortly. I am going to close this for now, as all samples will be looked at. Thank you!. Anything helps my friend :) Pointing out this issue was a great start. Thank you!. @csimmonsbluebook At the moment I am still going through the samples to ensure that everything is correct for the latest Material, Motion, and Swift 4. Sorry if it is broken at the moment, it will be updated shortly. . I will update the CardTableView sample today, latest tomorrow. . @csimmonsbluebook no worries :) . Sample has been updated :) All the best!. Excellent, thank you :) . Very interesting, I will see if I can reproduce this. If you have a reproducible project, please share :) Thank you!. The easiest method for your issue is to set the navigation stack as the root view controller of the SnackbarController. Otherwise, look at the controller logic and copy that into your view controller, or subclass the SnackbarController and then add the details into your view controller as is. Other than that, until we refactor this design pattern, there isn't another option. . This has been updated in the development branch and will be released in the next release. Thank you for notifying us :). Make sure to use the development branch for now :) If the issue persists, please reopen it. Thank you!. Hmmm interesting. I am going to prepare the Swift 4 release tonight, so I will be double checking tonight. . Thank you! I moved those features out of the main development branch and put them in a WIP branch. I moved the PR to that branch. I am going to give this a review. Thanks buddy! . @OrkhanAlikhanov To avoid any issues with the prototype code for RadioButton and Checkbox, I moved this to a separate branch, so people can consume the development branch for Swift 4. @mohpor Did you want this in the WIP or development, and excellent work, I will review it today. Thank you!. @mohpor All the code that is in the wip branch should be updated by rebasing the development branch, and PR to the development branch. So your thinking was correct :) . @OrkhanAlikhanov yes, I see the deletion. Okay, I will correct that :) thank you!. Thank you!. Yeah, the development branch supports Swift 4 :) It will be in the master branch shortly. Thank you and all the best!. Hey! I would need to make a sample for this, would you be able to create an issue in the Samples repo and describe what you would like with images and / or links? Thank you!. Hey! Have you had a chance to look at these two samples, CardTableView and CollectionView?\nOne uses a CollectionView and the other a TableView to accomplish a feed style view controller with Cards. That said, is that what you are looking to accomplish? If not, can you show me an image of what you want to accomplish, and explain how these cards are being updated? Thank you!. I haven't heard from you. If you still face the issue, please reopen it. Thank you!. @HybridHB If you believe there is an issue, let's solve it :) I'd be happy to investigate this with you. . Hey :) Are you using the development branch?. Awesome :) I am closing this issue. . Cool :). This has been fixed in development and will be released shortly, thank you! . Fixed :) You can download the latest in Material 2.10.3. Thank you!. Hey! So two things I would like to ask, have you setup the buttons within the view controller for the bottom nav? Can you share a screen shot of your views rendering using Xcode's inspector?\n\n. Hey! I haven't heard from you. If you need any further help. Please reopen the issue. Thank you!. @seongminnpark Hey :) \nWhen using the NavigationController, you actually want to use the pushViewController method. The Toolbar was custom built so it has a slightly different interface. The NavigationController is subclassed from UINavigationController, so most of its features are from there. So you can do this: \nswift\nnavigationController?.pushViewController(TransitionViewController(), animated: true)\nTake a look at this line in the NavigationController sample project https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/blob/master/Projects/Programmatic/NavigationController/NavigationController/ViewController.swift#L84.\nIf you need any further help, please reopen the issue :). @mohpor Thank you for your help :) . Hmm... can you show me the error for this. I don't see it when I compile. Thank you!. I removed that function :) in this release Material 2.10.4. Thanks for sharing. . @muppetkermit What do you mean version 3.0?. The v2.x.x branch is a running branch to point to tags aside from master. Once Apple makes an official update, everything we maintain gets pushed to that update. I'd be happy to further help in the Material Gitter channel :) As for now, I am going to close this issue and hope to hear from you there. Thank you!. Can you send me a sample project that highlights this issue?. @chilinh thank you! I will take a look at the sample. . I will look later tonight, if not tomorrow latest. Sorry for any delays :). Hey, sorry for any delays, @chilinh. I had fallen behind due to work. I will be looking at your issue today. Thank you!. This is confirmed as an issue and we will work on a fix. Thank you for bringing this to our attention :). Working on this :) Hopefully a fix will be available very soon. . @phillippbertram I will take a look today and see what I can come back with. . Please give Material 2.13.0 a try. If the issue persists, please reopen it. Thank you!. Hey! You can use the placeholderVerticalOffset, placeholderHorizontalOffset, and placeholderActiveScale in order to customize the distance and scale on both axis. . There are sample projects you can use. As well, we will be demonstrating many new things that can be done with Material this month as we have finished our documentation tool :). It will include that and more, but mind you, Material is a tool to make any component really, so you can always go beyond what we supply. . It will be available on either CosmicMind.com or MaterialSwift.com. We are deciding on how we will roll this out. I am starting to put it together here https://www.cosmicmind.com/danieldahan/lesson/7. . @Zangoran Will do!. Can you send over a project that reproduces this issue?. Hey! I Haven't heard from you. Please reopen the issue when you have a sample project reproducing the issue. Thank you!. Yes, that is correct. I removed all conflicting extension properties that are bound to a layer to avoid conflicts with other libraries. To add them, you can add an extension like so to your project:\nswift\nextension UIView {\n    @IBDesignable\n    var borderColor: UIColor {\n        get {\n             .....\n        } \n        set(value) {\n             .....\n       }\n    }\n}\nPersonally I would have loved to keep them in. That said, too many libraries make these shorthands and it was becoming an issue. All the best!. Since title caused conflicts, you can now access the navigationItem.titleLabel.text for setting that value :) Please reopen the issue if you need any further help. Thank you!. It should by default be set to center. Can you make sure you have set the NavigationController and NavigationBar in storyboard, and if this is programmatic, please share your code setup. . Not in this version of Material. You will need to set the color like so: \nswift\nnavigationItem.titleLabel.textColor = .white\nWe are working on theming, which will solve this issue as a global solution. . I will take a look at your sample project tonight or latest tomorrow :). Hey @vksid I will be looking at your issue today. I had fallen behind due to work. Sorry for any delays. . Yes, that would definitely do it. If you need any further help, please reopen the issue :) . Please send over your project, I will take a look at what is going on? Also, what version of Xcode and Material are you using?. Thank you, I will investigate this. . I tested this using the ToolbarController sample project and all works well. I don't see anywhere where you are setting the title. Try setting the title in the initializer: \nswift\nlet b = Button(title: \"Testing\")\nIf you experience further issues, please reopen this and send a sample project that reproduces the issue. Thank you!. Hey @MacMeDan :) \nYes, I would be happy to help. Basically, now Motion is a submodule for Material. This is why it is making the clone call. This is a good issue, as it will help many people down the road. I am going to install now using Carthage and will get back to you in a moment. . Are you running this carthage update --use-submodules ?. Give that a try.. Ah yes, I am in the process of updating all the samples / repos / etc...  Did it work with that flag being set?. Okay, I need to change it to https. One sec, I will make a change for that. Can you try this version Material 2.11.3 please :). Are you including the Motion framework ?. Sorry that was for a previous comment. I\u2019ll be back at my computer momentarily. . Here is the .gitmodules file\nsubmodule \"Sources/Frameworks/Motion\"]\n        path = Sources/Frameworks/Motion\n        url = https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion.git\nCan you try this --use-submodules --no-build ?. I don't personally use Carthage and never have, so I am a bit green on this. @mohpor maybe you know how to do this?. 100%. Motion is the animation and transition arm in Material. As we add more animation based components, it will be pulling more from Motion. I separated them as Motion could be used without Material. Prior to this, Material copied the files over, and that was causing a maintenance issue. At the end of the day, I am happy that there are package managers out there, and I am sure this is not the first time this issue has come up, so there must be an easy solution for this. I will try and add Material and Motion to a new project tonight. . So I believe the issue was that I was missing a Cartfile that had the Motion dependency. So I added that in Material 2.11.4. Please read the installation guide if needed. Thank you for bringing this to our attention and if there continues to be an issue, please reopen this. . @wflores96 Is this your first update to having Motion separate? Are you adding both Motion and Material to your project?. Hey! Thank you :) I believe this is the latest version before Swift 4, Material 2.10.2. If you need any help, we are here. . Hey! Let me take a look at this and see what should be happening.. I tested the ToolbarController samples project. All seems to be fine. I set the viewWillTransition function in the AppToolbarController class. May you send me a sample project that can reproduce this issue?. You are using everything correctly, but are missing a key concept that I must write about as it will make a game changing difference for you when using Material and Motion. That said, I have been working on it and will aim to have it ready for you. The basic idea is that each controller component has a transition area. When you place rootViewControllers in the component, that rootViewController is the transition area. So if you transition from the navigationDrawerController.transition, the entire rootViewController will be changed. If you use the toolbarController.transition, it will transition the area that is the rootViewController of the ToolbarController. From the NavigationDrawerController if you call the toolbarController.transition, it will activate a change for that rootViewController and so on. Does this make sense? If it is not transitioning, there may be a bug, but I haven't seen one, so I would need to test or get a sample that demonstrates the issue. . Cool, I will check it out and see what's up. . The transition method should only fire when the size of the UIViewController changes. Triggering a transition call does not trigger the willTransition method. Apple is responsible for firing that call entirely. As for the transition not working, I had tested it now and all seems to be fine. \n\n\nIf you have any further issues or questions, please reopen this issue :) Thank you!. Would you be able to send me a sample showing this? Is this tested on the simulator or device? What version of Material are you using? Thank you!. Hey! I haven't heard from you. When you have a sample project reproducing the issue, please reopen this. Thank you!. Thank you! I will take a look :). @tomdaniel0x01 So I found the bug. The issue arises because the size is being set after the left and bottom positioning. I am looking into it. You can workaround this issue by moving the size constraint before the position constraints: \nswift\nview.layout(fabMenu).size(CGSize(width: 56, height: 56)).bottom(17).left(10). The issue has been completely resolved in Material 2.12.3. Thank you for sharing this issue. All the best!. @yasirmturk Can you share a sample or some code that demonstrates this and your usage?. @yasirmturk Can you send over a sample of this, so I can reproduce the issue? As well, I would open a new issue for this, as now this issue has been closed and the description at the top is not describing the issue you are facing. Thank you!. @yasirmturk Please open a new issue for this. Tagging this issue on the current one is not effective. Thank you :). I removed this merge and the other ones prior in relation to this. The fix doesn't consider images.. Yes and no. There are properties now that will need to be maintained, and I think it would be better to do something like this:\nswift\ntabBar.setColor(.blue, for: .selected)\nThis would completely abstract any specific attribute this is set for (images, text) and removes the management of the properties internally. . Please find this feature available in the latest Material 2.12.0 release. \nExample: \nswift\ntabBar.setColor(Color.grey.base, for: .normal)\ntabBar.setColor(Color.blue.base, for: .selected)\nThank you @mohpor for the initial version, it really helped with laying down the groundwork :). I don't believe this is needed as another PR has this functionality. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1004. The Capture API is being completely rewritten and has been removed from Material many versions ago in order to not create issues for anyone. The best approach to help you is to provide the version of Material you are using and a sample project so we can look from there. Thank you :). @jojonarte great! Thank you @mohpor :). So it looks like now Obj-C requires this addition for Swift 4. I pushed a version now that adds the @objc to the tabItems, Material 2.12.1. Please verify this works for you and I will add the remaining @objc where necessary. . The associated PR for this https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/914. . How are you trying to access it?. I merged in your PR. So I will close this for now and use the PR as a release note. Thank you! :). It is most likely because Material has updated to Swift 4 on you in the update. What version of Material are you using? To fix it, you will need to force a version of Material that is still Swift 3. Can you share the errors?. Hey! I haven't heard from you. If you still have any issues, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. @smalam119 There is nothing about Material that should be stopping you from using firebase. Try Material 2.10.2. If the issue persists, please share the errors that you are getting. Thank you!. I am not sure what your setup is. Make sure you are using Swift 4 for Material 2.10.3+ and Swift 3 for anything below. I am not sure what Firebase is doing, so if you prepare a sample project, I can comment on Material within there.. Anytime :). This is now in Material 2.12.2. . I reopened the issue #860. So I will close this as they are now linked. . I fully agree. I added this issue to https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/860. Let's track the conversation there. . @stasivanov You are correct, you must use Swift 4 now. If you need help migrating, please let us know. Thank you!. No it is not possible. There is a lot going on and to extract a single component would be challenging. . This is an issue that I am working on for the TabsController. It happens because we need to load the view controllers and get the tabItem. I need to fix it, so that I can extract the tabItem and not actually need to add the view to the hierarchy. Thoughts?. Yes, agreed. I haven't had a chance to look into it. I will put it as a high-priority as many people use the TabsController. . Nice, okay, I will look into it with that approach. Unless you have a moment to dive in. I am working on another issue at the moment. . Yeah, I have no plan on using the UIPageViewController, as I had originally made the TabsController with it and it did not offer much. I think there is a way to ask the view to load but not for rendering, which will probably be an approach to look into. . As mentioned, it is to get the tabItem value from the controller. I need to work on an approach that get's that value without needing to go through the steps you described. . In order to get the tabItem, the view needs to be loaded. It is the only reason I am loading the view controllers in the first place. If it is working without needing this step, then great :) . Yes :) I know it is triggering it, and I am doing it for the reason I described earlier. As mentioned, I know the issue and I know the solution I would be looking for, I haven't had a chance to work on it yet. . Excellent, thank you for the PR. I will review it and push a release :). So the PR that you sent doesn't work. It causes the issue that I was describing. Are your TabItems showing up?. Can you try your version with the TabsController sample project? It is not working for me, or maybe share a sample that works? I really want to take your PR, so maybe the setup needs to be updated in the sample project. . Nice, I was hoping to get your PR in. Would you please submit the PR again? Thank you! . This has been released in Material 2.12.4. Thank you and all the best!. You can use the:\n```swift\nopen func setLineColor(_ color: UIColor, for state: TabItemLineState)\n/// example:\ntabBar.setLineColor(.green, for: .selected)\n```\nSo replace your self.pageController?.tabBar.lineColor = UIColor.cs_Citron() lines with that. \n:) All the best!. Not sure I understand where the difference is. You are updating a property versus using a function to update. The same code you are running is running internally now. Possibly a more interesting solution would be to allow colors to be selected based on index. Something like: \nswift\ntabBar.setLineColor(.green, forIndex: 3)\nthinking out loud here. . Cool, I like this feature :) I will make it a feature request and update it by then end of the weekend. . There is always a challenge in make an easy to use component and one that has many configurations. I will be working more on this component today, which will add and review features. Thank you for the PR. It will be a great start for me today :). We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. I am downloading the iOS 10 simulator and will check to see what the issue is. I will update you shortly. Thank you!. Hey! I tried this on iOS 10.3.1 and all seems to look good. \n\nAnything I am missing, or can you send over a sample project please ?. I will take a look today :). @st34m3dr1c3 I confirmed the issue. I am working on a solution. Thank you for sharing this :). I fixed it :) I will push to the development branch and would you be able to confirm?. There is an issue I found with iOS 11 and sizing not behaving correctly. I will be fixing that with this fix as well. . You can find this fixed in Material 2.12.12. Thank you!. What version of Material are you using and is this happening only on the simulator?. Yes, you need to test on devices as simulators are known to have issues in general when doing animations. Apple recommends that all animation based testing be done on devices over simulators. I have confirmed that this works correctly on a device. If you test it on a device and the issue persists, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. Sweet :) Thank you for double checking. . Cool, I will add this as a feature request :). @OrkhanAlikhanov What do you think of this?. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Please find the solution for this in Material 2.16.2. Thank you!. Hey, welcome to Material. Please take a look at the installation guide for help. Basically, you need to include the Motion framework that is built with Material. If you need any further help, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Hey! Thank you for the PR :) Can you show me a demo of what this does please? Thank you!. As @OrkhanAlikhanov mentioned, there is support for left / right views. Is there a benefit to your setup over the already provided left / right views?. @hastoukopsaro You can do that as well by adjusting the divider line and extending it across the entire TextField. I am going to leave this PR up and take a look at it more closely in the upcoming week. . I am going to close this PR as it is already possible to accomplish the proposed behavior. Thank you very much for sending this our way :) !!!. What version of Material are you using? \n\nTabBar.buttons is now TabBar.tabItems.\nSetting the line color is done through `tabBar.setLineColor(.green, for: .selected) -> a color and state. \n\nMake sure that you are using Swift 4. If you need any further help, please reopen this issue and please consult the CHANGELOG. . The convenient properties were removed to avoid issues with other frameworks. Try: \nswift\nview.layer.shadowOffset = ... \nview.layer.shadowRadius = ...\nIf you have any further issues with this, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. @melcug I wish I could make some features and not have it affect other frameworks, so it is a push and pull relationship sometimes. . Taking a look now :). You will find a fix in Material 2.12.4 and you should only need to use: \nswift\ntabsController?.select(at: tabIndex)\nThank you and all the best!. It has been released, and if you like, change the corner radius for the line, something like this: \nswift\ntabBar.line.layer.cornerRadius = tabBar.line.bounds.height / 2\n:) All the best!. What version of Material are you using? Can you send over a sample project?. @melcug Please provide a sample so I can reproduce the issue. Thank you!. @melcug for (*) In 2.12.7 release TabsController didn't includes anymore motionTransitionType property. \nIn the next version, you will be able to use the motionTransitionType property with a new rule set for overriding transitions. It was accidentally not released in the latest. . Please find this fixed in Material 2.12.8 :). This is now in Material 2.12.5 :). I am making the update now.. This is now in Material 2.12.5 :). I don't ignore PRs, so not sure where that comes from. As well, I made the fix in Motion, which actually does the transition :) I am releasing it within the next 10 mins. . Because Motion handles the transition. Material doesn\u2019t need to add the child controller. Infact, I can probably remove more logic now.. As well, I didn\u2019t ignore your PR, I modified it to fit a bigger picture. If there is incorrrct behaviour happening, please show me. I haven\u2019t seen any though. . The access to this function was blocked in favour of your previous suggestion, tabBar.setLineColor(.green, for: .selected) I will open this back up as it is cumbersome to set the line color this way for one state. . This is now in Material 2.12.5 :). I must be missing something here. All seems to work and I updated Motion. Thanks for double checking this. . I\u2019ll double check :). What version are you using? . That's your commit. What version are you testing that Material fails on?. Well, I put the logic in Motion, which is the actual transition library. So I need to see the issue, I am testing your lifecycle functions in the sample. . Please try this commit https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/68308add8a4232021a4cc45f0cb8fda128edcc51. I found an issue with that last commit, but please still do try it. The issue is in other TransitionControllers. . I will need to look this through some more, but your suggestion is on the right track. I have to confirm this doesn't break other controllers and that all cases are handled. Thank you! I will get back to this tonight or tomorrow morning :). Please find a comprehensive update in Material 2.12.7. Thank you for working on this with me :). No worries, thank you for sharing :). I see what you are describing. I have an idea of how to make it work correctly. I will give it a try after another task I am working on. . Well I was thinking that in the shouldAutomaticallyForwardAppearanceMethods call, we can return true on the first instance. . I actually like your solution better as it is clear as to what is happening. With a hidden flag, which I am not a fan of, does not demonstrate clarity when looking through the code. I am going to test how your solution works. . This is the corresponding commit that will be in the next release https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/5e8497dbc1f9bfa670b454f4a64a66e8f7ee8844, thank you!. Please find this fix in Material 2.12.8 :). I will take a look. At the moment, I am working on Navigation issues, so this will be testes with those updates. . Things look good in your sample, I don't see any buttons though. I am using the latest version of Material 2.12.8. If the issue persists, please reopen this issue. Thank you!\n\n. Let's follow this issue using #933. Thank you!. Yes, you need to set the Swift Language Version to Swift 4. If you have any further issue with this, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Hey! I believe your Pods project or Material target within the pod configuration needs to be set to Swift 4. Please give that a try, and let me know :). How about the Pods project? . Sweet :) All the best!. You can find this merge in Material 2.12.12. Thank you!. Yes it does. I need to update the README. The latest version supports Swift 4. Thank you!. You need to use Swift 4 :). Ah yes, sorry about that. I\u2019ll do it on the next release. Thank you! . You can use the SearchBar without the controller. Nothing stops you from doing so. As well nothing is complex, it\u2019s a lack of knowledge that you face. . I can help you, what is your desired look? . No worries. So what are you trying to do? I can help you. Thanks :). If necessary I can have search bar in another controller similar to UISearchController implementation -> this is exactly what the SearchBarController(rootViewController: ...) pattern does. It organizes the SearchBar separate from your changing view controllers, which are being transitioned in the rootViewController space. If you want to do this with a standalone SearchBar, you can do this, and you can also use AutoLayout. \n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    fileprivate var searchBar: SearchBar!\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    prepareSearchBar()\n}\n\n}\nfileprivate extension ViewController {\n    func prepareSearchBar() {\n        searchBar = SearchBar()\n        view.layout(searchBar).top().horizontally()\n    }\n}\n``\nIf you need any further help, please reopen this issue. Thank you! . Looks good :) I will test and commit it today. Thank you!. Thank you, this will be released later today :). We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. If you set the width of theImageCard, then the width of the subcomponents will automatically adjust to size. Have you tried that? Have you taken a look at the [ImageCard](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/tree/master/Projects/Programmatic/ImageCard) sample?. @yasirmturk If you set the horizontally value, it stretches the width across, so you wouldn't provide another width value. Have you looked at the sample?. Okay, I will take a look, thank you!. Grid works perfectly fine and is the basis of every component practically, so if it didn't work, everything would be broken. And you must callgrid.commit()becausegrid.begin()` was called earlier. \nThe ImageCard works perfectly in the sample and with the latest. \n\nYou will need to provide me a sample that reproduces your issue. All the best!. I don't have an issue if it does not get called then. I don't think there should be any layouts until the views need to layout. So what are you trying to accomplish?. Seems to work for me. Are you fully updated to the latest? There is one issue with the top alignment that I am fixing now. \n\n. Please pull the latest Samples too, I updated the Grid sample now :). Well let's say this is a case, what would be shown if the TabBar was on selectedTabItem = nil?. You should then use a Toolbar, as that breaks the behaviour of the TabBar. Tabs are always meant to have a selected Tab. Supporting a nil state will over complicate the component at the moment. What you can do, is hide the line until a Tab is selected, but you will need to manage its view controllers if you are using the TabsController. If you want to send over a PR, I'd be happy to look it over and further consider it once the behaviour is at least usable. If you need further help with this issue, please reopen this, thank you!. I think the best approach would be to create a base ScrollBar class that is extended for both the TabBar and Toolbar, allowing it to spread the scrollable functionality. I am reopening this as a feature request. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. I tested it and all seems to be fine. Are you using carthage update?\n\n. I haven't heard from you, so I will close this issue for now. Thank you!. Thank you @yasirmturk, that is the correct answer :). Please try changing the Pods project settings, not Materials alone. . Can you email me your project? Support@cosmicmind.com. I will check shortly. I am not near my computer now. . I will be back to investigating issues in the morning. I was on a vacation during the past few days :) Thank you!. Amazing! Thank you!. @yasirmturk thank you for your help, and @ijameelkhan happy all is working for you now :). Can you send over a sample project to reproduce the issue?. I haven't heard from you, so for now I will close this issue. Thank you!. I will investigate this, thank you :). Is this the difference CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 50, height: 50)?. Please try this with Material 2.14.0 and let me know if the issue persists. Thank you! . Please reopen this issue if you still face troubles with it. Thank you! . Looks correct, I will double check today. Thank you!. I am downloading the iOS 9 simulator to confirm this issue and will push a fix right away :). Yes, it was in iOS 10 as well. I missed this when I was updating everything for iOS 11. Thanks guys. The fix is in Material 2.12.15 :) . It was removed a while ago in favour of a rewrite that will be launched in Material 3 as an optional subcomponent. Here is the new repo Capture, which we can work on to integrate into your application and will be part of Material 3 :) . Well I wouldn't say that it is stable yet with all the latest changes. So installing through Pod may not be the best idea. The current Pod name is Flash. I am working on this API in December for Material 3. . Are you setting the initial navigationItem values in the your rootViewController?. I will take a look at this later today. Thank you!. Awesome! :). Hey :) Is your handleMenuButton in a view controller that is being removed once you push your new view controllers? If that is the case, then the function handler may be out of scope causing the issue. I would need to look at your project to confirm this. . Yes, please email me the project at support@cosmicmind.com :) It would be easier. Once I am done giving you help, I delete all materials you sent. . Great! I will take a look shortly :) . Make sure to add the Motion framework as well, which is built as a dependency with Carthage. Take a look at this installation guide. If you need any further help, please reopen the issue :) . Are you using the TabsController? If so, please take a look at the TabsController sample. You should be setting the tabs in the view controllers themselves. If you need, please reopen the issue for further assistance :). @atistank awesome :) All the best!. You need to check your constraints for your app, this is not a Material issue. If you would like help with your application, you can write to Material Gitter :) All the best!. The code that is delivered through our frameworks is copyrighted. Anything else you do is yours. As well, you can modify our code, but you must leave the license in there if you leave a substantial amount untouched. You cannot use our name to endorse your app. That's it :) no tricks. Enjoy!. Thank you, that is correct. There was an extra call. It will be posted in the next release, later today. . It's a pleasure :). @cuongtv51 excellent, I will take a look :). Please find a fix for this in Material 2.12.16 :). You need to set your Pods project to Swift 4. Give that a try, and if you need, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Awesome! Thank you :). That is the correct tag to use. To make it easier, I made a branch swift-3 from that tag. \n:) Thank you!. If this is still an issue, please reopen it. Thank you! Sorry for the late reply. . @yasirmturk is correct. This is an iOS 11 issue and I have tried many times to fix it without the best results. I will give it another try, so I will this up for now. Thank you!. Correct, we can close this. Thank you @intoxicated. Hey! Are you asking how to do this?. One way would be to add a container view and then pad it as you would like. Then add a child view controller to that container, in this case it is a NavigationDrawer. Then from there continue as you would normally. If you need any further help, please reopen this issue :). @shemchavez  If you are using Pods, update the Pod project, if not, then update the working App project.. I will investigate this today and release a fix :) Thank you!. This will be in the next release and here is the commit for the fix 6612bfd0da441a2669546c69285193ab6d89a3b9. Thank you :). I will be taking a look at this later today. Thank you!. @joeljfischer Can you send over your code setup, sample project. That will help us. Thank you!. @ToonvanStrijp Thank you!\n@adamdahan Let's replicate this and make Material 3 solves this issue. . Okay we will investigate this. Make sure that a height is being set for the contentView area, otherwise it may not know how to lay itself out. . Not necessarily. It would need to know to layout itself so that the height may be obtained. To test this, can you try setting the stack view layoutIfNeeded prior to setting it? Like so: \n```swift\nstackView.setNeedsLayout()\nstackView.layoutIfNeeded()\ncard.contentView = stackView\n```\nIf that works, I can make an update to Material that will fix your issue. Thank you!. Then please send over your project for me to test :) And I am sure we will have a fix. . @joeljfischer excellent, I will take a look. Thank you!. @joeljfischer After looking at the sample project, there are a few issues: \n\n\nSetting constraints in IB causes issues when you set use view.layout, which sets conflicting constraints. So delete the ones in IB. \n\n\nThe UIStackView has no concept of height, so you need to set the height to some value, or set the layout of the label to generate a height for the stack view. \n\n\nGe rid of the stack view and use a container view with a size and then go from there. \n\n\nUse the label itself, like so: \n\n\n```swift\nlet label = UILabel()\nlabel.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 16.0)\nlabel.numberOfLines = 4\nlabel.text = \"text, text, text, and text\"\ncard.contentView = label\n```\nIf you need any further help, let me know. In the new site we will write a tutorial for this to better help in the future. \nThank you!\n@adamdahan ^. @joeljfischer excellent insight. I appreciate the notes, and yes it will help in writing the tutorial. Thank you!. No worries :). Can you send a sample over please?. Sorry the delay, I was on vacation - I am taking a look now :). @rblalock you can remove isMotionEnabled = true as it is enabled by default for the NavigationController. Also, I am having trouble to reproduce the issue on the latest with the iPhone X simulator. Would you be able to send over a reproducible project?. @rblalock I don't have an iPhone X. I will keep an eye out for this. . @rblalock Can you share how you are setting up your view controller stack?\n. Hey! I tried the sample project now, NavigationDrawerController sample, and all seems to work. Can you confirm using the latest Material version and with the sample this issue exists? If not, we will need to investigate your setup. Thank you!. Have you tried it with the sample, because I did and there is not an issue. . This is not happening to me with the latest and same simulator. Can you ensure that you are not loading a cached copy or something corrupt, because I cannot reproduce this issue? . Here is what I get: \n\n. I am closing this issue for now. If you send me a reproducible project, I will reopen this. Thank you!. Ah I see, well two things. One you are using a normal UINavigationController, the sample used a Material NavigationController. Second, you are doing this on a simulator, which means you might be breaking the touch events when the cursor goes off the simulator screen area. I would check this on a real device and send me a reproducible project. If you need any further help, let me know :). Thank you, I will take a look :). I see now what you are saying. I can reproduce the issue. I'll take a look :). @ToonvanStrijp I will add fix that removes the need to add the UITapGestureRecognizer. . Hey, sorry for the delay. I was on vacation. I will take a look today :) . @aemgtz Thank you. I am investigating the issue. . Can you try this commit and tell me if the issue has been fixed, 9d03ba4ebfebc1debe0f901098a9cbd3e881c453. Thank you!. @ayham-achami nice, I will make a release now :). Released in Material 2.12.19. Thank you!. To add a Snackbar to a view controller is an exercise of adding the code in the SnackbarController file. You can extract what you need and add it to your view controller. As well, you do not need to have the SnackbarController as your rooViewController. You can wrap it around any view controller and it would only be available in the view tree. Does this make sense?. @srikanthsrnvs no worries :)\nSo basically a SnackbarController uses a rootViewController initializer. This basically take a view controller that you have, let's say MyVC and allows you to wrap it, like so: \n```swift\nlet vc = SnackbarController(rootViewController: MyVC(...))\n/// do something with vc, for example add it to view hierarchy \n```\nNow the Snackbar will be accessible in the MyVC to do with what you like and all the functionality will be there. \n. Yeah, for example: let's say you have this as a TabItem in a TabsController: \n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass FeedTabItemViewController: SnackbarController {\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\npublic init() {\n    super.init(rootViewController: FeedViewController())\n}\n\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    view.backgroundColor = .white\n\n    prepareTabItem()\n    prepareSnackbar()\n}\n\n}\nfileprivate extension FeedTabItemViewController {\n    func prepareTabItem() {\n        tabItem.image = Icon.cm.photoLibrary\n    }\nfunc prepareSnackbar() {\n    /// prepare snackbar...\n}\n\n}\n```\nNow the SnackbarController is wrapping the FeedViewController and you can do what you like. This is a more advanced technique. . Yeah, copy the SnackbarController as your base and build from there. Sorry I can't offer more resources for help, an Education Center is being worked on aggressively to help with questions like these. . Awesome, if you need any further help, please feel free to ask away :) I am taking note of these questions and writing up content for them. . @stasivanov yes, I will add them today and make a release with some other fixes. Thank you! If you can make a PR with a working version, that would be even better to avoid any issues with me missing something. . Will be in the next release with this commit: e19cd9cb51fde2f49a9ae66546355f182e7e67af. Yes, it can float anywhere. In the FABMenuController sample you can see it on its own with an added view controller that you can add a TableView or other view components. In the CardTableView sample you can see a more robust usage of a TableView and FABMenuController. Hope this helps :). A related feature request is this one: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/656 and the commit to your suggestion is here https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/0223578fb7b534f9e612a11de0a6661904ea58b6. I am going to release this in the next release. . You need to use a BottomNavigationController to do that. If you need any further help, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Use the BottomNavigationController as a base and here is some sample code that achieves what you are looking for: \n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass PhotoViewController: UIViewController {\n    convenience init() {\n        self.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n        prepareTabBarItem()\n    }\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    view.backgroundColor = Color.red.base\n}\n\n}\nextension PhotoViewController {\n    fileprivate func prepareTabBarItem() {\n        tabBarItem.image = Icon.cm.photoCamera?.tint(with: Color.blueGrey.base)\n        tabBarItem.selectedImage = Icon.cm.photoCamera?.tint(with: Color.blue.base)\n        tabBarItem.title = \"Photos\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n. I need to see an image or get a sample project to investigate. Please send one my way :) Thank you!. Yes, set the BottomNavigationController, or TabsController as the rootViewController of the UINavigationController :) They are all UIViewControllers at the end of the day. . Making that it not difficult, but it looks broken. Is it meant to be like that?. How about you make some adjustments and then PR it? . I am closing this issue for now. . Hey! Take a look at this site, http://materialcolor.com. It shows you the colors mapped with code, hex, and the swift label. If you need further help, please let me know. Thank you! I will be updating it to make it more clear. Basically, it starts from the base and goes up and down the darken and lighten scale. . Take a look in #983 . I will put this in the queue and aim to launch it with Material 3. . We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Your project needs to be set for Swift 4, including your Pods settings if you are using CocoaPods. Al the best!. Yes, you can use the SearchBar component. If you need to see any functional references using it, take a look at the SearchBarController internals and the Search and SearchBarController samples :). Okay, I will take a look :) May you share with me a visual of what you want to accomplish?. @lhalcyon thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov What do you think of this issue?. @OrkhanAlikhanov awesome! I will close this issue. Thank you!. can you remove this: self.fabEnterAddress.fabButton.imageView?.contentMode = .scaleAspectFill ?. This is an iOS 11 issue. iOS 11 adds some spacing. This issue has been noted internally and will be potentially fixed in Material 3, if a work around has not been added before hand. I will leave this up as a reminder. Thank you!. @intoxicated I would appreciate your help very much. Let me know what I can do to help you fix this. Thank you!. @intoxicated excellent, thank you! From Friday to Tuesday I will not be around, so please, if you need me, ping me before or after that time. . Yes this is fine to close. Thank you!. Well you can, but how do you want to do this? The SearchBarController allows for you to add buttons around the search field. . Hey, I haven't heard from you. If you are still facing this issue, please reopen it. Thank you!. @samantharachelb Yes, that is correct. I am closing this issue as an update to Swift 4 is what is needed. Thank you!. This is a great question. In Material 3, which releases next month, we address this issue more simply, with a better API. For now, you would need to wrap the controllers around each other, like so:\nswift\nlet snackbarController = SnackbarController(rootViewController: rootNavigationController)\nwindow!.rootViewController = AppDrawer(rootViewController: snackbarController, leftViewController: menu)\nYou can access the SnackbarController using the optional snackbarController property found in all UIViewControllers. \nIf you need any further help, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Hey! Great point and thank you for submitting this. In Material 3, this will be addressed. . Please give Material 2.13.0 a try. If the issue persists, please reopen it. Thank you!. You would want to do something like this: \nswift\nwindow!.rootViewController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: menuController, leftViewController: leftViewController, rightViewController: rightViewController)\nYou have already made the relationships in these lines: \nswift\nlet tabsController = ...\nlet toolbarController = ...\nlet menuController = ...\nIf you need, please reopen this issue :) . @kjhatis I described how to do it above. The initializer you are using to setup the controller is invalid and does not exist. Please refer to my comment above or the Samples repo. It is very easy to combine controllers. If you feel the need to use another framework, then please do so. \nAll the best :). @sarojraut what version of Material are you using? There was an issue before that is similar to this and it was fixed. Thank you!. @sarojraut well I am not going to confirm it is an issue until I see your code setup and what is happening there. Please share a reproducible project that I can investigate. Thank you! . @wstudios please share your setup code. If you are using the CollectionView object from Material, there should be an interimSpace and interimSpacePreset property. Let me know, thank you! . Thank you! I updated motion with your find, Motion 1.3.1. Material 2.13.1 has the update as well. I will take a look at the sample project now. . I will need to look further into this. The issue only seems to happen in your sample project. . The unbalanced calls should now be gone in Motion 1.3.2. Material 2.13.2 :). Please find a correct fix for this in Material 2.13.3 and Motion 1.3.3. \n  . Thank you! :). Can you try setting the FABMenu.isEnabled property to false when you do not want it to close? I may need to make some adjustments to make this easier. So please let me know how that works for you. . Hey, I haven't heard from you. If you still have this issue, please reopen it. Thank you!. Hey, this has been requested and is in progress for Material 3. Please follow this issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/560. Thank you!. Did you figure this out?. You can set if it is enabled by using the TextField.isVisibilityIconButtonEnabled property. As for changing the image, I will need to make that a feature request. I can include this behavior in Material 3. I will leave this up as a reminder. Thank you!. There are two new properties in Material 2.16.0. \nswift\nvisibilityIconOn\nvisibilityIconOff\nEach allow an image to be set for the visibility icon. If you need any further help, please reopen, or create a new issue. Thank you!. Yes, I am going to fix this today. Please follow this issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/issues/24. Thank you! Sorry for the inconvenience. . Please find a correct fix for this in Material 2.13.3 and Motion 1.3.3. . It actually goes up and then goes down. I think the issue is that it is only looking for TransitionController types. You can see this in the line below: \nswift\nv = v?.parent as? TransitionController\nIf I push a change to development, would you be able to try it? Or can you send me a sample project I can try?\nThank you!. Okay, give this commit a try: cf88010a46778f7fb98a29ebb6d63632cfc75f2b. Basically it was skipping over one of your contained view controllers and making it nil, forcing it to search top down. This was happening because it was only looking for TransitionController types, and yours would have been a UIViewController with potentially a different subclass. I will make a release now for this :) \n  . Here is a release for the update: Material 2.13.4. Thank you for sharing :). You can do this using the delegation methods associated with the TextField. There is not a validation check for the values added, at least not at the moment. It would be a good feature though, and has been noted prior. I will add a feature request tag to this and make a sample or build it into Material. Thank you!. I agree @adamdahan. Are you suggesting to leave this outside of Material for now?. I am going to close this issue as the PR is merged in. Let's focus on tomorrow making a release.. May you share: \nMaterial version, \niOS version, \nDevice\nthat you are using? Thank you!. I will investigate this. Thank you for sharing. If you do not hear from me by Friday, please follow up. .  Perfect! That is very helpful :) Thank you!. @adamdahan Can you follow up on this please :) Thank you!. Sorry for the delay. I have been working on another task. I will make an effort to look this through within the next couple days. Thank you!. I am really excited to review this. Thank you! I will look through it tonight :). @angelix nice catch. Do you mind opening an issue for this, and we can take a look? Thank you!. You have quite a bit going on in the code. My first suggestion would be to take a look at this sample: NavigationDrawerController. \nAside from that, if you are using a NavigationController, you cannot gain access to it through the toobarController convenience property, you would need to use the navigationController convenience property. \nYou AppDelegate code, which you can find in the sample I shared with you, should look something like this: \n```swift\nlet appToolbarController = AppToolbarController(rootViewController: RootViewController())\nlet leftViewController = LeftViewController()\nlet rightViewController = RightViewController()\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\nwindow!.rootViewController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: appToolbarController, leftViewController: leftViewController, rightViewController: rightViewController)\nwindow!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n```\nIf you have any further questions or need help regarding this issue, please reopen it. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov @adamdahan I think that updating Material to no longer use any magic numbers would be ideal. . Thank you for sharing this issue. I am going to investigate it tonight. In the meantime, if you have a sample project that reproduces the issue, that would be great.. Thank  you! @andrewc94 . Hey sorry for any delays with this issue. @adamdahan let's both take a look at this one. . @adamdahan I fixed the alpha issue. We will make a push later today. . @andrewc94 Thank you for sharing this issue, thank you @adamdahan for discovering the solution. The fix is in development and will be pushed later today. . Hmmm.... are you using another language? What version of Material are you using, device, and may you send over a reproducible project?\nThank you!. Hi, we have not heard from you. Please reopen the issue if this persist. Thank you!. Excellent :) All the best!. @ravigupta049 May you share your implementation of @adamdahan's recommendation?. Hey! It will be release in Material 3, which is launching shortly. Thank you!. The properties were removed to avoid conflicts with other frameworks. If you want them back, create a local extension and copy and paste the code :) \nAll the best and if you have any further issues, please reopen it. . You can access the optional helper statusBarController property available in all UIViewControllers: \nswift\nstatusBarController?.statusBar.backgroundColor = Color.blue.base\nIf you need any further help, please reopen this issue :). I will give this a try :) Thank you!. @garrialmighty It does look like a bug. Okay, I will work on this tomorrow and push a fix. Thank you!. You will find a fix in Material 2.13.6 for this issue. Thank you!. Sorry this response took a while. You are getting two toolbars because you are using the ToolbarController and NavigationController. You only need one. If you use the NavigationController it will manage a back button for you, otherwise, you will need to do it manually with a ToolbarController. \nIf you need any further help, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. I will take a look, thank you. . The issue is that the NavigationController is a wrapper around a view controller. The preparation method needs to be moved to the NavigationController, and called in the viewDidLoad phase. Something like this:\n```swift\nclass AppNavigationController: NavigationController {\n  open override func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n    prepareTabItem()\n  }\n}\nextension AppNavigationController {\n  func prepareTabItem() {\n    tabItem.title = \"Blue\"\n    tabItem.setTabItemImage(Icon.add, for: .normal)\n    tabItem.setTabItemImage(Icon.pen, for: .selected)\n    tabItem.setTabItemImage(Icon.photoLibrary, for: .highlighted)\n  }\n}\n```\nIf you need any further help, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!\n. Hi, sorry for the lates response. Do you have a sample project that will help reproduce the issue? Thank you!. Hey! If you need please reopen this issue, or create a new one. Thank you!. I will take a look, thank you!. This will be added as a feature request. Thank you!. We are documenting the feature requests and closing them as issues. Thank you!. Awesome, I will test this and add it to the next release. Thank you!. What version of Material are you using. There isn't a MaterialTextField, only 1TextField. . No worries. . I will take a look into this, do you have a sample project that demonstrates the issue you re facing? Thank you!. I am closing this issue, if you send a sample project or code block that demonstrates the issue, please reopen this. Thank you!. This is really neat. Will take a look very soon. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov Please consider this update when you make the changes to theErrorTextField`. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov I agree with you assessment. @JessicaGillan thank you for the PR, but for now, we will close this and revisit the idea once we have more time, or a more robust solution comes in as a PR. Thank you again! . Thank you for sharing this issue. I have fixed it and all should work fine now. Please pull the latest. All the best!. Yes please, I would be more than happy to add such an addition based on your PR :) Thank you!. This has been released in Material 2.16.0. Thank you!. That is because the tabs are being shrunk down. Have you tried the tabs with the scrolling option which should avoid such an issue? . I'll take a look at your sample project. Thank you! . Give this a try, Material 2.13.7. I updated your code as follows: \n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nimport Motion\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n\n    let viewControllers = [\n        makeViewController(backgroundColor: .red),\n        makeViewController(backgroundColor: .green),\n        makeViewController(backgroundColor: .blue),\n        makeViewController(backgroundColor: .yellow)\n    ]\n\n    let tabsController = TabsController(viewControllers: viewControllers)\n    tabsController.tabBarAlignment = .top\n    tabsController.tabBar.dividerAlignment = .bottom\n    tabsController.tabBar.lineHeight = 2\n    tabsController.tabBar.heightPreset = .small\n\n    addChildViewController(tabsController)\n    view.addSubview(tabsController.view)\n    view.layout(tabsController.view).edges(top: 50)\n\n    Motion.delay(3) {\n        viewControllers.first?.tabItem.title = \"abcdef (10) really long\"\n        tabsController.tabBar.setNeedsLayout()\n        tabsController.tabBar.layoutIfNeeded()\n    }\n}\n\nfunc makeViewController(backgroundColor: UIColor) -> UIViewController {\n    let vc = UIViewController()\n    vc.view.backgroundColor = backgroundColor\n    vc.tabItem.title = \"abcdef\"\n\n    return vc\n}\n\n}\n``\nI made your text longer and used Motion to set a time delay. As well, for the edges layout, you can do this, and the rest of the values are defaulted to0`. \nswift\nview.layout(tabsController.view).edges(top: 50)\nThank you for sharing this issue and if you have any further trouble, please reopen this issue or create a new one.. Hmmm... I will try your sample again. . I am not sure exactly why, but the issue is your () characters. It causes the ... to appear between it and it's previous character. . Weird... this is something in the String system I would think. Very interesting. . Have you tried: \nswift \ntoolbar.backgroundColor = .clear \nYou can access the toolbar from any view controller by using the optional helper: \nswift\ntoolbarController?.toolbar.backgroundColor = .clear\ntoolbarController?.displayStyle = .full\nAlso make sure to set the displayStyle to .full from .partial otherwise your content will not extend beyond the boundaries of the Toolbar. This is if you are using the ToolbarController inside the NavigationDrawerController.  \nGive that a try, and if you need, please reopen this issue and I will continue to help. Thank you!\n. Thank you! Will take a look very soon. . @OrkhanAlikhanov I think that happened when I fixed the merge conflicts. I may have removed the incorrect parts. We can roll this commit back and remerge, or take the necessary changes and make them ourselves to speed it up. What would you like to do?. Agreed and good choice. Thank you!. Nicely done... truly :). @phlippieb sorry about that, I must have hit the wrong button. I appreciate the followup. . What it is saying is to leave the shadow handling to the framework... otherwise it is completely managed by the developer. What are you trying to do?. Hey! I haven't heard from you, so if you need, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. Try setting the depth or depthPreset property off the TextView. \nswift\ntextView.depthPreset = .depth3\nAs an example. Let me know if this helps, as well, let's move this conversation to https://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material. Thank you!. Okay, go to the Gitter channel and we can discuss more. . Excellent, let's close this. Thank you!. I understand the issue. How would you like the swipe to work for your project?. You can enable and disable it. You can enable it when it is not on the first tab with isSwipeEnabled and disable it when on the first tab. . If you need any further help, let's chat on Material Gitter. . Thank you! I will add this in. I may change the name, but generally, this looks good :). Here is perfect, thank you! . Hey! Thank you for finding this issue. I'll look into this today and make a release :). I haven't finished my investigation on this. Will update you shortly. Thank you!. Excellent, so I will close this. Thank you!. All Material buttons are subclasses of UIButton. So you can do it like you would in general. All the best!. Awesome! Thank you :). Hey! I will push a release by tonight for this. Thank you!. Hey! I have a bit more to do with the release, so tomorrow during the day I will push it. Thank you!. Sorry for the late release. I have been focusing on documentation and was side tracked. I will make the best effort to release this update today. . I am reviewing this now and confirming a releasable fix. Sorry for the delays. Thank you!. Please find the fix in Material 2.16.0. Thank you!. Hey! I am working on a release for Sunday with the latest that has been in development. I'll make sure that the functionality you are looking for exists in that release. Update you shortly. . Hey! I am adding in functionality to set the image states, similar to setting color states. \n```swift\nextension TabBar {\n    /*\n     Retrieves the tabItems image for a given state.\n     - Parameter for state: A TabItemState.\n     - Returns: A UIImage.\n     /\n    open func getTabItemImage(for state: TabItemState) -> UIImage {}\n/**\n Sets the image for tabItems given a TabItemState.\n - Parameter _ image: A UIImage.\n - Parameter for state: A TabItemState.\n */\nopen func setTabItemsImage(_ image: UIImage, for state: TabItemState) {}\n\n}\n```\nI am currently testing Material for release. Thank you!. @nCr78 I am updating Xcode and doing a final test. Material 2.15 will be released today with your feature request. Thank you. . Hey! Give Material 2.15.0 a try.\nIt includes the image state functionality:\nswift\ntabItem.setTabItemImage(Icon.add, for: .normal)\ntabItem.setTabItemImage(Icon.pen, for: .selected)\ntabItem.setTabItemImage(Icon.photoLibrary, for: .highlighted)\nThe TabsController sample has been updated to demonstrate the new feature. . Hey! Take a look at these two samples TabsController and TabBar. If you still have any questions, please use Material Gitter and I will help you out. . Would you be able to send a sample over to me support@cosmicmind.com? I need to see your project to better help you. . Let's move this to Material Gitter. Thank you!. Please move this question to Material Gitter. Thank you!. Please move these questions to Material Gitter. I can help you directly there. Thank you!. At the moment it is not available. Shortly, but not yet. Please ask your questions about Layout on Material Gitter. I can help you directly there. Thank you!. Please send this question to Material Gitter. Thank you!. Hey! I appreciate you sending this over, but I removed all the extensions already in the recent versions of Material. If one remains, please let me know :). Hey! May I see your AppDelegate that sets up the TabsController?. Okay, so the first view in the hierarchy that will be looked for using the TabsController is actually the UINavigationController. The line: \nswift\nself.homeNavi = ... \nSo put the TabItem code in there, by subclassing the UINavigationController. \nThat's it. In the future, I will make a feature that sniffs lower in the hierarchy, but for now, it uses only the first controller it detects. \nIf you have any further issues, please reopen this issue. Thank you!. Hey! Very interesting. Would you be able to send over that project to support@cosmicmind.com, or a version of it that I can test and see what's up. I want to make a release today, and possibly I can get a fix in or suggest something for you. . Hi I haven't heard from you. If this is still an issue, please reopen it. Thank you!. You should update to Material 2.15.0. Let me know if you have any further issues. Thank you!. I believe in your Pod settings, the project that is in Xcode, you would need to set it there. Give that a try. Let me know, we can solve this today. . Hey! I would love to help, but I don't support 3rd party IDEs and or products I don't use on the regular. I would be open to making adjustments if there is a direct issue with how my headers are written, but from what I know, I haven't done anything out of the norm. Please feel free to connect on possible solutions you may find. Thank you!. I use function jumping all the time when developing Material. So the issue is new for me. I don't use Carthage, so if you can send me a project that replicates the issue, I would be happy to investigate. . please use : support@cosmicmind.com . Hey! Sorry for the late reply. We have made updates to both Material and Motion. Give the latest a try, and if you still face any issues, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you!. What exactly is not working? I am downloading a simulator for it now. . @daveleenew Thank you! I recently updated the samples, can you give it another try. If you need, please reopen this issue or create another. . I will take a look. Thank you! I haven't updated all the samples and will do that. . I recently updated the samples for the latest frameworks. Please update and try the samples again. Thank you!. Yes I would be. Please send it over and in general, I am interested in all PRs. Thank you!. Please link your PR to this issue and I will get it in for you. . @phlippieb Awesome, I will merge this in tonight or tomorrow. Thank you! Closing this for now. . Have you looked at the CardTableView sample project? That should get you going and if needed, please reopen the issue. Thank you!. The handler is actually set to the button. The UILabel is not a button, but a label. That said, you could alter the entire FABMenuItem and customize it. Let's move this to the Material channel and discuss further :) Thank you!. Hey! It was a n unfinished component that was in an alpha release. It is marked for completion in the next round of component releases. At the moment, the education centre I have been working is near complete and will release with updates to all the frameworks, including this. Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you! . Thank you. I will close this once Material is release with the updated spec. . This will be out in the next release. It has been merged with development. Thank you!. Thank you for sharing this. Can you send a sample over that I can review? . Awesome. I am closing this now. Thank you!. Adding https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1017. . @OrkhanAlikhanov We will need to add comments to the function definitions and any class/instance variables. . @OrkhanAlikhanov for the auto validation, you mean making an enum of different types? Yeah, I think that it would be a better approach. . @OrkhanAlikhanov I think for UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification, I think we need to look at accessibility as a separate issue. Come up with an entire solution for the framework. Let's leave it out for now and make a note that we need it here. . @autumnssun Interesting. I will replicate this and see what I can find. Thank you!. Let's follow https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1056 for this. I believe it is the same issue. . @OrkhanAlikhanov in the select(index) function, it calls animate(to: tabItems[index], isTriggeredByUserInteraction: false, completion: completion) which has the flag to determine if the delegate should be fired or not. . Hi, I appreciate the PR, but the delegate should not always be triggered. It should only be triggered on user interaction. That is an Apple rule. If you are looking to create a more data-driven approach, then there are other ways. . Let's remove them. Great find. . I merged in the PR. I will close this now. Thank you!. We can close this now as it is merged in. Than you!. @rex3du Can you clean your CocoaPods cache and try installing again?. @rex3du Are you using a beta version of Xcode?. @rex3du awesome, thank you!. I will close this issue now. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov . Excellent, thank you! I merged it into development and it will be out in the next release. I will close this issue now. Thank you!. Hi, and thank you! I am working on the documentation, and currently there are only samples to look at (https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples). You can ask any question on Material Gitter, or post any issue on github. All the best!. Thank you!. Thank you!. Closing this as we have an issue opened for it. . @Ronaldoh1 I am happy you are getting value out of Material :) \n@OrkhanAlikhanov made a good suggestion. If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new issue. . Why did you close this?. @chuynadamas Hey! Yes, I do the review. GitHub is referring to the administrator of the repository. Thank you for the PR, I will take a look and merge it in. . Thank you!. What is not working exactly? The switch, or the correct flag? I looked through the code and tested the sample project and all works as expected. If you need, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. Interesting. I will need to replicate this issue and see if it is an issue with Material's internals. . @albertml Can you send over a sample project for us to test?. @albertml So is there still an issue?. I am closing this issue. Nothing has proven to be an issue here. . Awesome! Thank you!. I will make a fix for this, it was an accident on my behalf when I updated the servers for the CM site. . I fixed the image issue, and need to update the README on installation. This will be done separately. Thank you!. I think for the purposes of customization, we can offer an enum that is by default set to auto for line transition changes, and then add a custom enum that accepts a value for the desired width. @OrkhanAlikhanov what do you think?. I think the 3 options would solve all cases nicely. Maybe we can rename the enum to TabBarItemsStyle. Not so sure I like the word Width in there. In either case, the naming could be changed on final review when we PR the branch into dev. . Please find the solution for this in Material 2.16.2. Thank you!. masksToBounds = true should actually be removed. It is incorrectly being placed on the wrong layer. It should be added to the visualLayer. I will fix this as I know the complexity of its behaviour well. I will work on this tonight. Thank you!. Fixed the issue f99b6dfdc61e99d8bf30168a4262383b8c184576, and the update will be released in a few hours. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov Is this still WIP?. @muzoman If would like to join our #opensource Slack channel, we can discuss scenarios of how to better the theming feature. If you are interested, please send your email to support@cosmicmind.com. \n. @OrkhanAlikhanov Let's move the Alert view to the development branch after our next release. I am going to close this as we no longer maintain feature requests here. . Please find a fix for this issue in Material 2.16.4. Thank you!. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov for your PR (https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1124), which is now merged into development. In our next release, this will be available. Thank you!. Excellent, I noticed you also fixed the Swift 4.2 issue. Thank you!. Thank you! @OrkhanAlikhanov is working on it at the moment. I would say a PR would be ready within the next couple days. . This feature has been addressed in this PR https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1130. @OrkhanAlikhanov Let's confirm this. If not, I agree that we should support it. . This issue has been addressed in this PR https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1130. This has been addressed in this PR https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1130.. Nice, I am going to test this through development. . @Yash2711 We are in the middle of preparing a release for Sunday night, to Monday morning. This will be included.. @OrkhanAlikhanov thank you for the explanation. . Hey! The BottomNavigationController is a subclass of the TabBarController. So it should allow the same behavior. Have you tried configuring your settings to the same as the TabBar you originally had working?. So it all works now?. @Parilar Motion, which is part of Material, allows for you to tap into UITabBarController's interactive and non-interactive transitions. We will put together a mini example on how to accomplish this.  . @Parilar Why do you need to switch navigation controllers from TabsController? Let's move to Material Gitter to help you better. . @bstillitano I agree, this would be great! Currently, it is in the queue. . @OrkhanAlikhanov good suggestion. As well, the version exists Material 2.16.4. . @vitormesquita May you send over a sample project that reproduces this issue. Also, are you using a Material NavigationController? Or a UINavigationController? Thank you!. Okay, unless we have a reproducible project, we put this in the queue internally for us to investigate as work. So I will close this now as you seem to have solved your issue, and we will make any new issues as we investigate more about this. \nThank you for bringing this to our attention.. The more you can send and help us discover the issue. The better :) Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov let's move this to a feature request, and I do believe it has great value in our Layout system. Thanks guys! . Did you set in your Storyboard the NavigationController and NavigationBar class names in the Xcode editor.. They need to be set programmatically, that is correct. The navigation items will need to be set in the root view controller of the NavigationController as per usual. If there is a failure to this, please send us a project that replicates the issue. Thank you!. @CHONUMAN awesome. If you need any further help, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. Excellent, thank you!. Either @OrkhanAlikhanov or myself will help you shortly. . Thank you!. @CHONUMAN Tomorrow we will take another look. This seems weird. Thank you for sharing this with us. . @CHONUMAN If you are using storyboards, I believe you need to implement that initializer.. @SDGMazeGeek Thank you for sharing your issue. If you have another, or still need help with this one, please reopen the issue. . @OrkhanAlikhanov Thank you!. @ConfusedVorlon awesome! Thank you. Also, please send PRs to development in the future :). @OrkhanAlikhanov That is a great idea. Please and thank you. . @OrkhanAlikhanov Thank you for following up. @shroff-kandarp If you have any further questions or issues, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you!. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov. @shroff-kandarp if you have any further questions, or another issue, please reopen or create a new one. Thank you!. Both tabBar.height and tabBar.heightPreset should work. Let's investigate this. Thank you!. @shroff-kandarp sorry, that is correct, we removed the helper extensions. I checked the sample project and can confirm that the tabBar.heightPreset works and aligns the buttons correctly, as you can see in the photo. That said, the tabBar.frame.size.height = x is not working, so @OrkhanAlikhanov and I will look into this. \n\n. @OrkhanAlikhanov The .custom(x) option is a much better decision. And yes, I remember now about the infinite growing issue. That is correct. Thank you!. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov. \n@shroff-kandarp The latest https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1151 merged into development now includes the feature required to solve this issue.. Hi @ThiyagarajanShivSankaran we haven't heard back from you, if you still require help, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. Please send over a sample project for our review. Thank you! . @OrkhanAlikhanov Thank you for looking into this. Let's continue the investigation. . @M47H3W Great! We will close this issue. Thank you. . Thank you @ashusath, we appreciate your response. @MuhammadNayabButt Please let us know if this works for you, and if not, please reopen or create a new issue. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov Thank you! We have been working hard on a new platform, and will be launching the documentation there. In the meantime, we will be posting basic documentation in the Samples Wiki, and I believe what you are looking for can be found here, with this sample installation guide. If you need any further help, we are here :). Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov . @bstillitano @OrkhanAlikhanov awesome :). A release is coming soon. As @OrkhanAlikhanov mentioned, please use the development branch, it is pretty stable for now. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov thank you! @karasahinemre I am happy it worked out for you. We will keep note of this and make a better solution. . I love this PR, but if you look at the development branch, we have already updated for Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2. There is a release coming for that and a bunch of great updates. Thank you!!!. @Ronaldoh1 correct, their is actually a fundamental issue here. @OrkhanAlikhanov it looks like we are adding a container view to the TextField in order to hold the collection of child views, which I believe this solution was added to accommodate multiple icons on the right hand side. The issue here is that if someone sets the rightView, which they will. It will cause conflicts. I think what we should do, is have a rightView property, which behaves normally, and then add a rightViews and if we like leftViews property to manage multiple icons/views on either side. \nThen if views are added like so:\nswift\nrightViews = [v1, v2, v3]\n...\nit will map internally to \nswift\nrightView?.grid.views = [v1, v2, v3]\n...\nwhich will then be handled correctly. . @Madhav1022 what branch/version are you using for this, and can you send me an image of what is happening now, and what it looked like before please?. @Madhav1022  If you still face this issue, please reopen this. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov All looks good. I think only the last little bug we found :). Hey @pedroOliveiraptc,  Thank you. Can you try the development branch, and let us know if the issue persists. If so, please send a reproducible issue so we can investigate it. Thank you!. @pedroOliveiraptc Are you still facing this issue? If so, please reopen this and submit a sample app. Thank you!. @OrkhanAlikhanov I created an issue for us to support RTL. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1179, let's follow that issue for the RTL feature.. @sillysachin If you still face this issue, please reopen this or create a new one. Thank you!. @sillysachin Thank you. . We will be moving everything during this month to the master branch, though, we are aiming to pair documentation with it. If you would like to be part of our #opensource Slack channel, send your email to support@cosmicmind.com, and we can answer questions directly and keep you posted. Thank you :). @shanezzar You can use the development branch, it is pretty much ready for release.. @OrkhanAlikhanov I am going to leave this up for now, so that other people can see to use the development branch for now. . @sillysachin I added the size API to the Layout toolset, and it is now in the development branch in this commit b95456d7a0e1639b714693361e18bdcb95968663. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov. . @karasahinemre The development branch works well, but we haven't released yet, as we need to document more. . Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov. That is correct @svachmic, we are preparing to launch a bunch of updates, so please be aware that some pointers may be incorrect for the next week. We appreciate your message and helping us build a solid product. . Hi Everyone! @OrkhanAlikhanov and I are working on preparing a release with the following changes. It is taking us some time as we need to create a new sample app and rewrite the READMEs to help with the new APIs. At the same time, we have been working on a new tool to help us create content, which I am happy to say is complete and now being integrated. The development branch is very stable and will be our candidate going forward.

Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov :) . @ludivinefafournoux the development branch now includes the fix to @OrkhanAlikhanov's PR. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov. . Hey @pedroOliveiraptc thank you. Let's go to the original issue https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1166, so we maintain the correct history. . Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1183 is now merged into development.. Thank you @dorindanciu :) It would be great if we can update all the observable keys, as @OrkhanAlikhanov mentioned. If not, we can merge this in and ensure the others keys are completed. Let me know what works best for you, thank you!. @dorindanciu thank you! Great work :). Hey! I think this is because of the touch event to shrink the pulse is not fired when there is a swipe. @OrkhanAlikhanov I think we can set a timer on the pulse if the user hasn't released it, or we can look for when the button is offscreen, no longer being rendered, and update the animation lifecycle. These are some quick ideas as I think about this issue. . @OrkhanAlikhanov let's discuss this in Slack, @gedzionsas if you would like to join our #opensource slack channel, please send us your email at support@cosmicmind.com. I will leave this issue up until we resolve it. Thank you!. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov, https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1183 has been merged into development. . Looks great! Thank you \ud83e\udd47 . @markst Hey! Great question. The visualLayer allows a view to contain clipped content without needing to add another container view for shadowing. The parent view's backing layer acts as that container. \n\nIn your code, add the subview's layers to the visualLayer, which will clip the radius corners, and allow for your shadow to be displayed.\nIf you would like to join our Slack channel to further discuss send your email to support@cosmicmind.com, or you may answer here to keep the history of this issue. Please reopen or create a new issue if you need. Thank you!. Thank you @Drusy. This is great!. @OrkhanAlikhanov thank you that is correct. @hhoangna if you need any further help, please reopen or create a new issue.. @hhoangna take a look at the Samples repo to start. . Hey! @muzoman, have you tried adding an event handler to the navigationItem.backButton?. @muzoman that is a good idea. @OrkhanAlikhanov what do you think?. @OrkhanAlikhanov let's make this a feature request and plan it in our upcoming work. . @markst Hey, the contentViewAlignment does not belong to the search text, but the search element. It says to keep the centerView aligned in the center relative to the left and right views. What look are you going for?. @CHONUMAN thank you for the question. Yes, @OrkhanAlikhanov let's make note of this and add it when we have a chance. @CHONUMAN if you want to make a PR, we would be happy to help. Thank you. . Hi @22Round, thank you for sharing your issue. Please provide more information on how contentEdgeInsets is not working, and what you are trying to do with its positioning. Pictures are very helpful, and more detail is always great. When you have that ready, feel free to send your email to join our Slack channel to support@cosmicmind.com, or reopen this issue. Thank you!. @puji26 Thank you for sharing this issue, but you have provided so little information for us to go on. Please provide a working sample that demonstrates the issue you are facing, or please provide more information - like the actually error log. . @SDGMazeGeek You can easily make it, based on your description, we would most likely demonstrate how to build such a component, rather than provide it out of the box. If you would like to start putting together a component like that and want our help, we would be happy to discuss it with you in our Slack channel. You can be invited by sending your email to support@cosmicmind.com. As of now, we don't have the bandwidth to make it completely on our own. Thank you for sharing your idea, it is a really good one.  . Where is the nil? If there is still an issue, let's reopen this. Thank you!. Thank you @OrkhanAlikhanov ! @KingOlami If you have any further issues, please reopen or create a new one. . Awesome! Thank you!. @22Round We are in the process of releasing all the frameworks this week, so once that is done, we will get back to this issue. As well, can you share the device and Material version you found this issue with? Thank you. . Thank you for sharing this. We are uploading a completely new README with links in a week. So please bare with us, and this will be fixed soon.. Thank you for sending this to us. All PRs must be against development. As you can see, conflicts arise. We would be happy to get an updated version of this PR for review against the development branch. . Thank you @vivi7, great work.  . @vivi7 awesome, thank you!. Thank you @hardikamal \nThere is a link at the bottom of the README that takes you here https://www.uplabs.com/posts/material-design-sticker-sheets. \nAll the best!. @hardikamal You mean this https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples. @hardikamal, what is a sticker sheet sample?. The sticker sheet is used only in illustrator. What specifically are you trying to accomplish? . no need for the \"r\" here, can pass in the CGRectMake call directly as a parameter to the following CGRectContainsPoint. Also, swift doesn't need (style) 0.0 when using values without decimals places. so could be 0. \n. If you set the value here, the left side is updated, not right. Is this your intention?\n. What happens on devices that are 414 in width like a 6 plus?\n. wait! let me finish the review. \n. Why not set the rightThreshold which creates the right max width, and thus not hardcoded to 320, which is set in the method. What if someone wants an expanded view in an iPad, that spans to let's say 600 px when in landscape mode?\n. Well the 320 max is a device thing, and we have had requests to allow people to set the max width. It is easy to use the setLeftViewWidth and setRightViewWidth that can easily be set to 320. As an animation and graphics framework, this creates a problem. Not all users who use Material use it for Material Design, they use it to customize the components. This seems like an unnecessary limitation when one can accomplish the same goal without the framework being limited. \n. Here you are not following the codebase style. The type should be set. \n. rather than CGFloat(320), you can type set and do let maximumWidth: CGFloat = 320. \nWhich also follows the style of the rest of the codebase.\n. So rightViewWidth is set to MaterialDevice.width if the property is nil? The animation will then extend that to the device width, is this the desired effect?\n. Yes, I like explicit, very clear, unambiguous code, when achievable. At this point, the style is very important, as no one has convinced me how to approach it. Swift is a young language trying to be shaped by many people. Its better to code clearly than adopt a style that may change. Coming from c and c++ background, being explicit is important. If swift is type safe, it should be written type safely. As well I am javascript heavy, and swifts remind me of javascript and c++ combined. So i like free flowing languages as well. In this case, I chose to be very explicit. \n. I think we should call this BarStyle. And it would be cool to include this at the BarView level so any subsequent BarView can take advantage of this. Like SearchBar for example. \n. Yes that is correct. If it is updated, it should get reloaded. We should not include the BarHeight.Default value, it should be .Default, which is cleaner and more simple. \n. This should call the self.init(frame: CGRectZero) initializer. We should always try and set a frame if possible. \n. We shouldn't hard code the values here, as they should be set once the BarHeight value is set. If it is hardcoded here, it will create more maintenance. \n. The default value should come from the intrinsicContentSize of the BarView. This will allow an extension on the BarView that can customize that setting. \n. Default should be 44, Short should be 32, and Medium should be 56, and Tall should be 72. The reason for this: 32 is Apple's small size for a navbar, 44 is their default size, 56 is Material Design's default size, and 72 is large enough and keeping increments of 8. \n. We can discuss this :)\n. I think we want to keep these functions. The are very helpful. \n. These calls here can be replaced by the show/hide calls that we should keep\n. I think you meant to write linear. \n. this can be default\n. no worries :) You did great work. Thank you!\n. why do you want to make this and other functions open?. No worries :). As a note, I updated this line to: \nswift\nIconButton(image: isSecureTextEntry ? Icon.visibility : Icon.visibilityOff, tintColor: placeholderNormalColor.withAlphaComponent(0.54))\nless code :). One more note, if the developer sets the tint color of the button, it will be changed here to the placeholder color. So this should handle that: \n``swift\nanimations: { [weak self] in\n                            guard letself` = self else {\n                                return\n                            }\n                        guard let v = self.visibilityIconButton else {\n                            return\n                        }\n\n                        v.image = self.isSecureTextEntry ? Icon.visibilityOff?.tint(with: v.tintColor.withAlphaComponent(0.54)) : Icon.visibility?.tint(with: v.tintColor.withAlphaComponent(0.54))\n\n                      },\n\n``. You did great! It is my responsibility to massage it into the framework. Keep it coming ;) . Excellent comment. I will update these. Thank you!. I think we should rename this toisErrorMessageRevealed. This will allow theisError...prefix to be used and helpful when searching for flags through Xcode's code completion.. I think it would be better to set the default value here, forerrorColor`, as we do in font and number lines, rather than trigger a watcher in a prepare statement. If someone subclasses, it could trigger undesired behavior. Also, it helps when navigating to find everything in one spot if that is the pattern being used. . The header file comment needs to have the Material license added, and the default header comment removed. You can add your name as the originator at the top in the license if you like. Everything else would need to be the same.

Let's always move all preparation code to their own prepare function called in an instance prepare function. Material follows this setup pretty much everywhere. Mainly, it is to give clear insight into code changes. For example, if I comment out a prepare function, I know that all prepare logic is contained. Where if we scatter the logic, it could lead to undesirable behavior. . If we add @discardableResult to isValid we can remove the _ =. . Let's change deferred to isDeferred. The is... prefix is helpful when Xcode's auto completion pops up, as it will display all boolean or similar is... flags, which is an easy way to investigate an API. . Shortening variables is okay in function bodies, but for function definitions, let's use full variable names. For example: msg: String. It is more helpful when searching API definitions and it is more clear to the reader. . No you don't need to call that. The reference to target is not long lived, so you don't need to detach from it. . Yes that is correct, and agreed :). If it is set, then there is no need to call errorColor = { errorColor }(). The line could probably be omitted completely. . It is fine. It can stay. I thought we were introducing a new piece and so the format should be discussed in general. A style guide needs to be developed from the current code base, and changes we would like to make for future releases.. Yes, and we should continue this pattern where necessary, or come up with another approach. . For the setter and getter, please you use this format: \nswift\nget {\n   return ...\n}\nset(value) {\n   ... = value\n}. Both order and name matter. As it is consistent with the entire framework. Also, helps to search everything easily when it is the same naming and format. . Interesting. Does The reason I believe UInt32 works over Int32 is because UInt32 is unsigned which means all values are positive and it could hold a larger range, where Int32 is signed and therefore holds a smaller positive range but both negative and positive. So please use UInt32.. Yes, we need to modify this. I was going to do it internally, as delegation methods should only fire when triggered by user interaction. Did you want to update this?. It would be more consistent to use let v = view rather than let view = view. . For comments, when the parameter has a _ before it, like _ block the comment should have it too. . When we have case ..., we should always leave a space before the next case. . Don't forget the comments ;) . Nice!. This is a coding preference for me, always put the number, for example -1, on the left, because then it acts as a safety for a possible error like this currentIndex = -1, which will pass, but may be difficult to find. This will crash -1 = currentIndex. . same as comment above about number values going on left. . Ah okay, then no worries. I think too much in C/C++ sometimes :) . Rather than callbacks, should we use delegates? Or possibly provide both?. Let's not use methods like setW, we should use setWidth. . Maybe DialogView, could be called Dialog, like Card. It is more of a component, rather than a single view.. If you use Constants to guide a components design, let's put it at the top, so when it is first looked at, we can see it right away and know the mechanical configuration. . We should make it that we can discard the result value, then we can get rid of _ = ..... What do you think of using the same naming as in a Promise, resolve and reject, rather than negative, positive, and neutral. Also, for neutral, I don't see where that state applies.. Okay, let\u2019s consider changing the name to resolve, reject, and cancel. But positive and negative don\u2019t actually imply a behaviour, more so a direction. . In this case you are forcing the developer to show and set the title at the same time. And if they do not do this at the same time, they must write extra code to avoid the warning. I think the developers will know if they are not showing the Dialog in their tests, and the code should be kept a bit more simple. . The positive, negative, and neutral buttons don\u2019t follow any consistency in Material\u2019s naming. Let\u2019s use resolve, reject, and cancel.. Are we only allowing heights from the preset values?. @OrkhanAlikhanov I thought that was the case. Thank you for clarifying. . ",

Crashed the app when trying to set the background color of a FabButton\ncurrentLocationButton.backgroundColor = MaterialColor.grey.lighten2 \n^ done in viewDidLoad\n. Hi @WooD1k, \nThere is an issue with your approach: \nWhen creating an iOS project you have three choices \n1. Using a template \n2. Start with an empty project and add a storyboard or xib. \n3. Pure code no storyboards\nBased on your sample project SideNavigationViewControllerTest it seems you started the project with either 1 or 2 from the choices above. \nThe issue to your approach was this piece of code: \nwindow = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\nwindow!.rootViewController = SideNavigationViewController(mainViewController: ViewController(), sideViewController: SideMenuViewController())\nwindow!.makeKeyAndVisible()\nClick on the Blue project file and then click on the app name under \"Targets\"... Look at the \"Deployment Info\" you will see that you have \"Main\" set under \"Main Interface\" \nYou are using storyboards so the code in appDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions wont work for you because it is using that \"Main\" storyboard file for the \"Main Interface\" of the project. So no need to override the window's rootViewController property because that's already happening in the background.\nTo fix your issue: \nStep 1. \nYou will need to drag a view controller from Interface Buildings Object Panel and change the class to \"SideNavigationViewController\" just like you would with another subclass of UIViewController. \nStep 2. \nThe only thing then left to do is assign a view controller to the SideNavigationViewController's mainViewController property. That can be done via dragging an outlet from IB or programmatically. The mainViewController property here represents the view controller you want to appear in the center.\nStep 3. \nMake sure you deleted the code in appDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\nHope that helps!\n:)\n. Hey @WooD1k, \nI see the issue now. There is no IBOutlet property for the mainViewController. We don't use storyboards much ourselves but we will definitely make that available in a future update. \nTo remedy your situation for the time being until the next release: \nClick on the Blue project file and then click on the app name under \"Targets\"... Look at the \"Deployment Info\" and delete the file \"Main\" set for the \"Main Interface\" and do it programmatically. \nJust replace the identifiers below and put this in your appDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions -> \nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet mainVC = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"YourViewControllerIdentifier\")\nlet sideVC = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"YourSideViewControllerIdentifier\")\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\nwindow?.rootViewController = SideNavigationViewController(mainViewController: mainVC, sideViewController: sideVC)\nwindow?.makeKeyAndVisible()\nClosing this ticket for now and turning into a \"Support Storyboards\" ticket. Feel free to keep on messaging us about your issue we always do our best to help you resolve it. Hope that helps and we will push the support you need in the next update!\nCheers\n. @WooD1k you can track the storyboard support ticket here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/MaterialKit/issues/75\n. @WooD1k my pleasure. \nAnd just a side note: The above fix allows you to keep doing your work in storyboards. The only programmatic thing done is passing the rootViewController to your apps window. So basically you don't need to do the dragging in IB to hook up the SideNavigationViewController. Just do that part programmatically and use the storyboards as you wish for the individual view controllers in your app. \n:) \n. @wooD1k Yes next release coming next week. We are just tracking our tickets internally now. Sorry I should have informed you. :) \n. @danieldahan Carthage support ticket\n. @kktam Select the project in question and go to Build Settings and toggle \"Embedded Content Contains Swift Code\" to YES. That should do the trick!\n. @rockwotj any sample code in a repo you can point us to? That would be great so we can to help you with a fix until we roll out support for the centre view controller swapping (next release).\n. @sohayb awesome :) :+1: \n. @skywinder Thanks for the script :) we are planning on rolling out a different solution for how we manage our repo workflow but definitely appreciate the PR. \n. Hi @paulvanwieren, \nThe buttons won't show up in storyboards because they are not defined as IBOutlet's. IBOutlet is a void type that Interface Builder recognizes. Unfortunately we do not have support for IBOutlet's due to the dynamic nature of .leftButtons / .rightButtons in the NavigationBarView \nThe best option for you in this case would be to subclass the MaterialView and construct a navigation bar look-alike in Storyboards where you can drag standard buttons on the storyboard and drag outlets to your custom subclass. \nNote * If you want the pulse effect on the buttons from the storyboard simply change their class in the identity inspector to one of buttons available in the MaterialKit framework i.e fab, raised or flat. \nWe do plan to support storyboards in the future but currently is not part of our road map. Feel free to ping us with some sample code if you get stuck on something. \nAll the best \n. @danieldahan \n. @LarsDR I tested the side nav and it seems to be working fine as long as the storyboard is configured correctly. \nBecause we do not support storyboards the only configuration that will work is following these steps: \n1. Go to your Target's info panel and make sure it is not looking to load the application from a base storyboard. You can see this underneath the \"Main Interface\" area in the info panel. If it has \"Main\" there or some other storyboard name - delete it. \n*Side note, I noticed that the image http://s.lars.io/20151221153825_0mtahp1jng.png has a -> Pointing to the root view controller of the storyboard but your code does not use the method instantiateInitialViewController(). You specify which controllers you use so you can remove \"Is Initial View Controller\" from the identity Inspector.  \nIf you do step 1. and keep your app delegate the way it is. You should have no problem using the side nav. \nIf it does not work, please reference this example project for how to do it: https://github.com/CosmicMind/MaterialKit/tree/master/Examples/Storyboards/SideNavigationViewController\n. @LarsDR I do the login / logout pattern you are doing in a lot of apps that are social. The best thing I have found in my experience is to have a view controller that is always at the root of the window. I call this the \"BackingViewController\".\nIf the user is logged in then the BackingViewController adds the \"Logged in\" storyboard's initial view controller as a child via UIViewControllerContainment. \nIf the user is logged out the BackingViewController swaps it's child with the \"Logged out\" storyboard's initial view controller. \nA few reasons why this is a great idea: \n1. It allows for animated transitions without taking snapshots and writing hokus pokus animation code. \n2. It is safer because the windows.rootViewController is never modified. \n3. Does not cause the \"jump\" effect when swapping the windows.rootViewController. \nAnyways, \nGlad you got it to work :)\n. @sohayb @danieldahan list looks great :+1: I would add the UISwitchControl & Floating Menu too\n. @vishiswoz That would be a good place to implement the delegation pattern. We don't make any assumptions as to what you will put in the SideViewController so you will have to implement that yourself. \nExample tip:\nprotocol SomeViewControllerDelegate { \n       func didSelectRowAtIndexPath(indexPath: NSIndexPath)\n} \n// in your subclass of UIViewController\nvar delegate: SomeViewControllerDelegate?\n// in your didSelectRowAtIndexPath where your UITableViewDelegate resides\ndelegate?.didSelectRowAtIndexPath(indexPath)  // where indexPath is that of your table view delegates didSelectRowAtIndexPath method.\nThen anywhere you want to be notified of the selection just conform to the SomeViewDelegate protocol: \nclass YourViewController: UIViewController, SomeViewControllerDelegate { .....\n// implement the delegate method \nfunc didSelectRowAtIndexPath(indexPath: NSIndexPath) { \n     // do something\n} \nHope that helps!\n. @vishiswoz closing this ticket but feel free to keep commenting on it if you need more support.\n. @sohayb thanks!\n. To fix it: \nwrap the animationDisabled internals with a dispatch call to the main thread. \n. tested and works in production with that fix. \n. Cocoapods \n. @ajaybeniwal Based on this: \"I get the error 2016-02-03 21:04:42.535 TransitFare[3631:1539353] Unknown class FabButton in Interface Builder file.\" \nIt makes me believe that you did not change the class from UIButton to FabButton. Did you ensure that you did this first in the IB Inspector? \n. @ajaybeniwal @sujithv28 Just make sure the class is set to FabButton & the module is set to Material and there will be no issues. I just tested it. \nThank you for bringing this to our attention, closing this ticket :)\n. Hi @sohayb, \nThe titleLabel is purposely set to the left by default, however, you can adjust it's position using the titleLabelInset property. \nHope that helps!\n. @chaitanya-ramji\nDid you synchronize your defaults after your set the SwitchState?\ni.e... defaults.synchronize() \n. Hey @GreyEcologist, thank you for the beautiful words. We really appreciate it. \nIn regards to your issue: \nCan you share your cellForRowAtIndexPath method so we can take a deeper look? \nImmediately first thought that came to mind was that you weren't persisting the state of switch. But after reading your message a couple times I want to make sure your implementation is correct and if it is, something might be incorrect on our end.\nThanks!\n. @danieldahan looks good :) :shipit: \n. @cosmo1234 \nFew techniques you can use for this: \n1. You can tap into the textField sublayers and perform a transform that will push the actual textfield's editable view over to the right. Then you can just draw the image in the paddings space. \n2. You can override UITextfield layout and add an image as a subview @ position 0, 0.\n3. You can create a custom view with a regular textfield + a CAShapeLayer as a divider and an image as subviews. \n@danieldahan Might be nice to consider this for option in Material 2. \nThanks @cosmo1234 - closing this ticket. \n. @shshalom Inside your controller you should not be using self.navigationItem.title. You should be using self.title = \"Your title\"\nTake a look here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/960316/self-title-vs-self-navigationitem-title\nCheers\n. @danieldahan We should remove IBDesignable support. \n. @PuneetKohli There is currently no supported way to do what you want to do purely through storyboards. It has to be done as a hybrid approach as mentioned by @danieldahan above. \nThe basic premise here is: \nYou can style your controllers in storyboards but the actual creation of the drawer has to be done in code. You can see this in the examples. \nReason being - we are not a storyboard first framework. \nClosing this ticket - let us know if you need further guidance.\n. @PuneetKohli you can check the Examples folder in the Material repo and click on the Programmatic folder. Then go to the NavigationDrawerController folder and open the project's App Delegate. You will see an example of how to do it. \n```\nfunc application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n        let navigationController: NavigationController = NavigationController(rootViewController: YellowViewController())\n        let navigationDrawerController: AppNavigationDrawerController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: navigationController, leftViewController: AppLeftViewController(), rightViewController: AppRightViewController())\n    window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\n    window!.rootViewController = navigationDrawerController\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n    return true\n}\n\n```\nIf you are using storyboards just don't alloc + init your controllers via (). Use storyboard methods like instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier.\n. @OnlyMyRailgun can you send me a screenshot? adam@cosmicmind.io or post here directly so we can all see! Thnx\n. @reidmain we are preparing the official release of Material 2 with Swift 3 support now. Very soon, hard date not set but sometime over the next week. \n. @danieldahan This is something that can be discussed within the community on Gitter. Please close this. \n@hisham2007 If you would like you can privately share your code with us and we can help you out but this isn't the forum for recommendations.  The comments you have left are awesome and we appreciate it but we would need to see your code before we can consider these issues.\nOn Gitter you can send us screencaps etc... and we can help debug that way.\nCheers\n. @hisham2007 Also please migrate to the Master branch - Material 2 has been released and development has been merged into master.\n. @danieldahan @OrkhanAlikhanov Is it possible we start working on this feature? @OrkhanAlikhanov seems to want to take the lead on it. I am glad to contribute as well. We most likely will need to settle on design first.. @cody1024d Will be testing this later this afternoon. Will be following up with acceptance. Thank you for the contribution. . Hi @cody1024d \ud83d\ude04  \nI was wondering if you could provide a sample zip project that I could use to test some edge cases? \nOnce I give it a run I am happy to go through the code more thoroughly and help accelerate your contributions adoption in the next release. \nMy Gitter handle is: adamdahan\nBest!. @chanonly123 missing a call to super in layoutSubviews.. @chanonly123  Also your for loop is in a dangerous place. Layout subviews gets called multiple times. And because you are just breaking out of it. Your for loop has no value. You can achieve the same thing by simply doing \n`let subview = subviews.first\n subview.layer.cornerRadius = cardCornerRadius \n// Note maskToBounds is useless too\n`\n. @OrkhanAlikhanov What a great job you have done with RadioButton, CheckboxButton, Groups and their internals \ud83d\udc4f \nGreat use of: \n\nCALayers\nHigh order functions\nMotion\n& Grid. \n\nAll of my comments in regard to the implementation would have only been about: \n\nPrivate struct for numbers\nAccess control \nFunction signatures \n\nLet's have a conversation over Gitter and well get this into the next release. \nThank you for your hard work. . @danieldahan @Maddy10 \nJust wanted to add my two cents \ud83d\ude04 \nValidation should live outside of the framework as there are too many types of fields and validations. Ideally you would have a protocol to enable such functionality. \nprotocol TextFieldValidator { \n     func validateTextField() \n}\nprotocol EmailTextFieldValidator: TextFieldValidator {}\nprotocol PhoneTextFieldValidator: TextFieldValidator {}\nThen you can conform to your protocol when you need to validate a specific field and implement the validateTextField signature. \nThis also ensures that you keep your code dry and don't create needless subclasses of TextField.\nLet me know if this makes sense - otherwise I can make a sample. \nBest!\n. @seubseub Going to be testing this later in the afternoon with a few other features - will most likely . get merged in Material 3. Will keep you posted. Thank you!\n. @seubseub Is it possible to provide a sample project so I can test some edge cases? \nMy Gitter handle is: adamdahan\nThank you!. @danieldahan This contribution is good to go! Fully tested and code review was completed by @OrkhanAlikhanov. @OrkhanAlikhanov Thank you so much for this - I really like the code. I do have a question for you: \nDid you consider using the Card as the Dialog itself? \nCurious to know if there is a particular reason why you rolled out your own card like Dialog. Had you made an extension built on UIViewController or used a custom animated transition coordinator which allow cards to be presented modally - seems like the same task could been accomplished with less code and be more robust. \nLooking forward to your response :) \nGood work \ud83d\udc4d \n. @andrewc94 Stacktrace very useful thank you. Will look more into this tonight :) . @andrewc94 \nI have confirmed the issue in the latest version of Material and found the root cause of the issue with your help. I will confirm a fix with @danieldahan and make sure this is addressed in the next release. The fix will address issues #853, CosmicMind/Motion#16 aswell. \nWill keep this ticket open until it's fully resolved. Thank you for the test project and stacktrace \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @ravigupta049, \nI have encountered this issue before. The map will always win the gesture if the map's bounds is equal to the frame of the rootViewController.view If you want that kind of functionality you need to think of a custom solution. Here is a potential way to solve the problem: \n\nImplement a custom overlay that sets isUserInteractionEnabled = false (above the map on the X most edge of the rootViewController.view) give it like a 20 - 30 width and then implement a swipeGesture whose callback triggers the navigationDrawerController.openLeftView()\n\nThe underlying issue isn't problem with the drawer - it's mainly about conceiving a custom solution for that kind of UI. . @ravigupta049 going to close this ticket for now :) feel free to message me directly on Gitter if you want to follow up. \nMy handle is @adamdahan. @jeffmiralles Are you referring to the default values? .

No worries. Good work guys :)\n. The pod name is MK\n. @danieldahan No worries :)\n. I may have resolved by just adding self. to the offending line. Will keep testing.\nIssue was intermittent to start, stack trace gave me little to no info.\n. I'm actually using the issue-44 branch that no longer exists because it was \nthe\nonly one that would compile on Xcode 7. Tell me which branch to test and \nI'll do\nso.\n. Sounds good, I'll test on dev branch starting Monday.\n. @danieldahan I still get the lldb error on the development branch.\nI did however get an update approved using MK cards so cheers :)\n. (lldb)\nThread 20: breakpoint 1.1\nNothing else is given.\n. Honestly I can't figure it out either. I've been trying to debug it all morning. The error is not consistently thrown, and although it causes the app to crash while connected to Xcode, I cannot seem to make the app crash when disconnected. Nothing other than the button itself is show in the scope, and everything inside the button looks fine.\n. No, none. You can close the issue if you'd like. I submitted an update \nusing the\ndevelopment branch. As far as I can tell the issue only happens when \nconmected\nto Xcode so we'll see if it gets approved.\n. Yes I perused the code and it looks fantastic. I'm updating to the latest release as we speak. Is there any way I can get the ImageCardView in the development branch or something like that?\n. That would be much appreciated!\nspottedu.co/mobile :) The update was just approved, so it's not live yet. Version 1.0.2 is the Swift 2 version.\n. You as well!\n. @danieldahan wonderful thanks!\n. Yes that's exactly what I'm looking for. If I load a portrait image, I would like the image layer to have the same portrait ratio. Is there an easy way to achieve this now?\n. That would be fantastic. Thank you as always. Any way I can buy you guys a round of beers?\n. Anything I can do to help :+1: Keep me in the loop!\n. That's awesome! I'm testing now. Looks great!\n.

    "zgosalvez": "@danieldahan No documentation on this. How does this compare to using MaterialView for a content view under a UICollectionViewCell?\n. @sohayb When you say Snackbar, does that include Toasts?\n. @danieldahan Setting the detailView with the custom UIView hides the pulse. It's still there but it's behind the detailView.\n. @danieldahan Dude, you're fast! And now, so is my app. Cheers!\n. Appreciate your relatively quick response @danieldahan . That did the trick.\nNeed help with your docs? I am using your library extensively for a project, so there will be a lot of components that I will be dealing with.\n. Looking forward to them docs @prateeksan !\n@danieldahan noticed a quirk when hiding. I initially followed SideNavigationViewController example. It hides now, but it doesn't animate and move up as seen in the App example. \nNot sure if it's a bug or just a docs thing, but I had to put the mainViewController as a root of a NavigationController to get the status bar animation.\n. More info if it helps: my mainViewController is a NavigationBarViewController\n. I see. So, I ended up not using NavigationBarViewController and used navigationItem property of NavigationController as implemented in the App example. Strange that I had to do that tho. Thanks.\n. This is still broken if I set titleLabel.textAlignment = .Center, with or without navigationItem.rightControls = []\n. I did play around with bottomBorderLayer and changed the height from 1 to 2; it looked close to the Material Design docs.\n. Great. You've been helpful by giving a workaround.\nThis worked for me in the mean time:\nswift\npasswordTextField.clearButton = clearButton\nclearButton.removeTarget(passwordTextField, action: \"handleClearButton\", forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)\nclearButton.addTarget(self, action: \"handleClearButton\", forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)\n. Found out that the button is there, because I can tap the left side and a pulse shows before popping back. I already checked the Assets for the back arrow icon in App example, but couldn't find it there yet it appears when running. Finally found it in SearchBarView example and copied it into my project. So now it works! The App example is somehow using the icon from SearchBarView example instead of its own assets.\n. In that case, it appears that icons aren't being loaded when using Cocoapods. I've manually had to import the assets when using MaterialIcon for it to work. For now I initialise UIImage instead since I like using PDF versions of the assets.\n. @danieldahan Please note that there are two important variables here: derivedDetailLabelHeight and derivedTitleLabelHeight. The values were derived from the view debugger, and may vary depending on the font used.\nAlso assumes that the the text field is on a light background. See lineLayerColor setting.\n. Based on my experience with Android, the pulse/ripple effect does not fade out until I lift my finger. I hoped to get this same experience by setting pulseFocus to true.\n. The title label does not appear\n. Yes, a placeholder is also set.\n. I tried doing the following \"hack,\" but didn't work, probably because of race conditions with the animations.\nswift\ntextField.sendActionsForControlEvents(.EditingDidBegin)\ntextField.text = \"something\"\ntextField.sendActionsForControlEvents(.ValueChanged)\ntextField.sendActionsForControlEvents(.EditingDidEnd)\n. @danieldahan My notes:\n- I'm surprised that you removed clearButton. I guess I'll have to implement that myself. Was using it for default clearing, and for toggling password visibility.\n- dividerColor isn't customisable? Its default color MaterialColor.darkText.dividers which is only appropriate on a light background.\n- dividerColor doesn't match detailColor when detail is set. E.g. the divider color is still the same as the placeholder while my detail is red, showing an error.\n- What's the ideal height for this component? Distances are no longer accessible. How are the other elements spaced in relation to MTextField? In placeholderEditingDidbeginAnimation() the placeholder label is moved to y = -21, where did -21 come from?\n. Curious, how did you compute for the intrinsic size? Also, I think you should add 8, to include the spacing between the label and input texts.\n. Oh so that's intrinsic size. How I do it, and more accurate (correct me if I'm wrong)...\n1. Create a label on the storyboard\n2. Set desired font\n3. Add leading and top constraints\n4. Update Frames\n5. Check the height of the Label\nIt appears that the height of the label is also the same as the height of its intrinsic size. In my case 19.\nEdit\nI realised you said add a text field, so instead of adding a label, I added a text field and followed my steps again. Still arrived at 19, when using borderStyle = .None.\n. The reasons why I decided to create the extension (see https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/336) are:\n- Easier for me to reuse setting Material specs for my project\n- More importantly, our users had a difficulty tapping the text field and clear button. Setting the whole text field to 80 made it easier for them. Something to consider since you're rewriting the class.\n. Here you go. My UIImageView is the parent of Material.FlatButton.\n\n\n. I tried this but couldn't get the UIImageView to center. \n\nOn May 16, 2016, at 21:41, Daniel Dahan notifications@github.com wrote:\nThe titleView is used to store all the values within the Toolbar.

Left sidebar width stops at 320, as per Material docs.\n. Not sure how it's going to be a limitation if users can still customise it using the said methods. The reason for this pull request is to set the defaults to Material design guidelines. I think it makes more sense if users get that out of the box, then if desired, customise the components themselves; They're guidelines after all.\n. Yes.\n\nMaximum width applies only when using a left nav. When using a right nav, the panel can cover the full width of the screen.\n. Just curious, any particular reason for this code style?\n. \n",

Regarding the setup, I'm adding the NavigationBarView in the storyboard but the setup is in the code.\nI'm going to abuse your library really hard, so you'll always get my feedback :)\n. Something was off in my code, sorry about that!\nClosing this now\n. Ah Okay, I kept it in the samples though\n. Weird, because the sample now is based on the latest release examples. Sure thing, the least I can do :)\n. Nope, still there\n. I cloned the master branch and it was there\n. MaterialKit -> Examples -> Programmatic -> StackView -> MaterialStackView -> ViewController\nthis is what I'm talking about.\n. Sure thing :)\n. Done!\n. Fixed that with the following:\nlet hud = MBProgressHUD.showHUDAddedTo(self.view, animated: true)\n            hud.layer.zPosition = 2;\n            raisedButton.layer.zPosition = 1;\n. Hi Daniel, sorry didn't get back to you right away, caught up in several stuff.\nWhen I added this PR I thought that since this library is porting Material Design to iOS then it should mimic the behaviour of Android's TextInputLayout regarding the TextField you're trying to implement. In the android case, this label is used to show error messages with simple setError function. What I can think of is that we have 2 functions/properties error and detail with setting of one clears the other, they both actually are using the same label but they have different text color, somehing like errorColor and detailColor. And what I think of as well is that the user shouldn't have to assign/create the label, or the font used, it should have a default font, font color and font size that he deosn't have to worry about.\nWhat do you think?\n. yeah I see. Maybe it's just me but I always liked the setError functionality that android has but it doesn't have any validation logic in it, just setting the error. Looking forward on how you integrate the idea. Still waiting the guys review regarding the CLA to sign...\nThanks again :)\n. Was going to open such a ticket. As you know, alerts are required in almost every app (logout prompts, single choice or multiple choice lists and so on) so it's great if you guys have that in mind\n. There's many libraries that are trying to port Material Design to iOS, I'm excited about yours because it's fully in swift and for the level of support we get mainly :)\nSo it would be awesome if this library turned out to be a one stop shop for all material controls!\nHere's the components that it would be awesome to add to complete the library, in my opinion this is the importance order:\n- SearchBarView\n- TextView\n- SearchBarViewController\n- TabView\n- TabViewController\n- Dialogs (regular, single choice, multiple choice)\n- Snackbar\n- ProgressBar (circular and horizontal)\n- DatePicker\n- TimePicker\nSo whatever can fit into your month would be awesome! Feeling a bit optimistic here :)\n. Updated list with TextView addition \n. Yeah that worked! Apparently, \"YES\" is the default as well, because I didn't set it at first.\nThanks a lot!\n. I faced a similar problem with MBProgressHUD, I solved it with the following:\nlet hud = MBProgressHUD.showHUDAddedTo(self.view, animated: true)\n                hud.layer.zPosition = 2\n                self.flatButton.zPosition = 1\nSo I guess you can do the same with your CardView in place of the HUD\n. Awesome! can you please close the issue?\n. You need minimum iOS 8.0 (as defined in the podspec) and XCode 7 with Swift 2.0\n. This is what I'm doing, or am I missing something?\n. Awesome. Thanks! :)\n. Unfortunately that didn't work :/ (Couldn't reopen the ticket)\n. Will do, thank you\n. Well that worked! Had to use another library to get around that.\nThanks a lot :+1: \n. to get the swipe gesture working, it adds the swipe gesture manually to controllers (back port it to iOS 6, imagine that :P)\n. Well I removed it now thanks to your solution :)\n. Well I solved it like this:\nnavigationBarView.titleLabelInsetsRef.right = 192\nBut that brings me to another issue I wanted to discuss since forever, I think the NavigationBarView takes so much code to get initialised. I guess having @IBDesignable can solve part of the issue, what do you guys think?\n. That's some great news!!! :+1: \n. Oops! This poses a problem for me as well, I didn't pay attention to that earlier.. @danieldahan what do you this?\n. I think the spacing is based on the material design guidelines and specs, thus it shouldn't be changed (I think it can't be changed on Android as well) check the design spec\n. hi @adamdahan \nActually my concern is that it's not centred vertically, not talking about the horizontal position.\nThanks\n. I tried that, the problem is whenever I modify the bottom inset, the navigation bar height changes, it gets bigger!\n. that worked! thanks a lot. But shouldn't the text be centred vertically by default?\n. Amen to that! \ud83d\ude05\n. hello,\nthe official framework name is now 'Material' so you can you it as follows:\ns.dependency 'Material', '~> 1.32.2'\n. You can check #161 for that\n. I was thinking Android \ud83d\ude01, like ActionBarActivity would have the actual ActionBar but has nothing to do with navigation. And your NavigationBarView has the same concept. Same thing goes for the regular UIViewController which has a navigationItem property.\n. Exactly :+1: \n. Right now, the title label in TextField floats (moves up) whenever a there's input but not just when it becomes firstResponder, which I think should be the case.\n. Sorry about this but again I'm copying Android behavior, this is the way text fields behave there. I need to double check the material specs for that, since you're not copying android, rather implementing Material design specs.\n. You're right, that's why I mentioned that I need to check the specs :). Well it's as I mentioned in the specs Labels\n. haha :) well it's not the visuals, they aren't showing any animation there, it's the description, and I quote \"When the user engages with the text input field, the floating inline labels move to float above the field.\"\n. Awesome \ud83d\ude0d\n. Sorry, didn't check github since this was posted :) \nYeah you're right, I think it's a matter of opinion as you said; I still think the UX is not that intuitive to the users nor to developers (having to handle this manually). Waiting your update on this.\n. hey @danieldahan, any update on the Theme API? Thanks a lot :)\n. Well TBH I haven't thought about how to design a Theme API in a generic way, I'm just using a solution I found online:\nswift\nextension UILabel{\n    var defaultFont: UIFont? {\n        get { return self.font }\n        set { self.font = UIFont(name:newValue!.fontName, size: self.font.pointSize) }\n    }\n}\n````\nThen in my AppDelegate:swift\nUILabel.appearance().defaultFont = RobotoFont.regular\n`\nI hope this is helpful.. I was just overhauling the app's code by removing all inline initialization code and replace by this code in the app's delegate \ud83d\ude03swift\n        UILabel.appearance().appFont = RobotoFont.regular\n    TextField.appearance().appFont = RobotoFont.regular\n    TextField.appearance().appIsClearIconButtonEnabled = true\n    TextField.appearance().appPlaceHolderActiveColor = .appColor\n    TextField.appearance().appDividerActiveColor = .appColor\n\n    Button.appearance().appFont = RobotoFont.regular\n    RaisedButton.appearance().appDepthPreset = .depth5\n    RaisedButton.appearance().appTitleColor = .white\n    RaisedButton.appearance().appPulseColor = .white\n    RaisedButton.appearance().appBackgroundColor = .appColor\n\n    FlatButton.appearance().appTitleColor = .appColor\n    FlatButton.appearance().appBackgroundColor = .clear\n    FlatButton.appearance().appPulseOpacity = 0\n\n```.

I have been using it until last week, every time I ran a pod update with material (and some other pods) they would add a bogus bundle framework that needed to be removed manually from the list of pod targets. It worths investigating on it as the release of pod 1.0.0 is imminent.\n. Agreed. Meanwhile, it is release candidate and wouldn't change that much to make any difference and I have faced it from day one of 1.0.0, we should at least find the cause and a solution.\n. No problem at all. I understand.\n. What's the status on this issue @danieldahan, @GreyEcologist ?\n. I'm on it now.\n. I found the root cause for this problem and designed a quick patch for it.\n\nThe culprit is the hitTest(_:, withEvent:): function in menuView. It needs to test the hit for the off shore buttons and because the menuView button is getting hidden (not disabled or removed) it still receives the touch events regardless of its visibility (because hit test only uses point-in-rect, and not actual ray-collision method).\nSolution\nCould be either:\n- Redesigning the MenuView to not rely on hit test\n- Add this line of code at the beginning of the hit test method:\nswift\nif self.hidden {\n    return nil\n   }\nShould I make a PR for second approach?\n. What's the status on this issue @danieldahan, @HowardCsie?\n. @brandonroth,\n@danieldahan has pushed a major redesign for the TextField. Could you please check if your issue has been resolved using the new TextField (currently on development branch)?\nThanks\n. Is this still a problem @danieldahan, @brandonroth ?\n. @ndlinh as @danieldahan has mentioned before, it normally means one of the view controllers involved in the transition, has a transparent background. Can you confirm that it's not true in your case?\n. Thanks and No problem\nI had fixed it in my PR but I didn't got the time to actually test it, therefore, No PR from me.\nThanks again\nGlad to be of any help\nM.\n. Sorry to bother you again,\nThis fix doesn't work. When I was working on it yesterday, I did the same thing (at first) and forgot to consider this fact that showTitleLabel() actually sets the placeholder to nil after storing it in placeholderText therefore in the didSet we will lose the placeholder value altogether! The only way I could think of (without introducing a new state variable) is to check if the titleLabel is visible when updating the placeholderText. i.e.:\nswift\nif let v: String = placeholder {\n                attributedPlaceholder = NSAttributedString(string: v, attributes: [NSForegroundColorAttributeName: placeholderTextColor])\n            }\nif !titleLabel.hidden {\n    placeholderText = placeholder\n }\nThe idea here is that the problem happens only when the title label is visible, the rest is working just fine. \nTo think about it, the whole mechanism needs to be redesigned.\n. Well, that won't work either! in the showTitleLabel() the titleLabel is still hidden.\n. Yeah, my original idea sucked. That's why I didn't submit a PR at the first place.\nI'm working today and I will find the time to do some thinking and I will share my ideas later on.\na bient\u00f4t\n. It works but fails when you want to remove the placeholder.\n. Yeah, definitely works. Should revise the whole mechanism.\n. I was thinking about it today. The only thing I could come up with was to introduce a new public variable that holds on to the placeholder value, propagates the changes to the underlying mechanism and acts a, well placeholder for placeholder! \nIt has the caveat of introducing a small redundancy and breaking the UiTextField api.\n. Thanks @danieldahan,\nI can confirm it solves the problem.\n. @riteshtechno \nLets focus on the issue. If the placeholder color is not working right, open a new issue.\n. @Bashta \n@danieldahan has fixed the issue and will be released soon.\n. I'm afraid not.\nBut if you want to live on the edge and enjoy the development with others, you can always use the development branch and participate in the Gitter Room's chat. \n. Looks like you're having too much on your plate @danieldahan \nI'm always ready to help. I've actually dedicated a certain amount of time from my workday to help you improve this wonderful library. I mean, you can just ask me. I'm not sure if I am even that helpful, but I can handle a few things.\n. I mean, it is already the de facto standard for iOS! \nSounds good to me. \n. Any news?\n. Here is how you make a card view centered vertically:\nswift\n        cardView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n        parent.addSubview(cardView)\n        MaterialLayout.alignToParentHorizontally(parent, child: cardView, left: 12.0, right: 12.0)\n        layoutIfNeeded()\n        let top = (view.bounds.height - cardView.height) / 2.0\n        MaterialLayout.alignFromTop(view, child: cardView, top: top)\nIt's a simple patch for now, there will be an AlertView soon. that should solve many other problems as well.\nCredits to @danieldahan!\n. @danieldahan I didn't totally got what you meant, the text alignment is clear enough I guess and the animation I just mentioned to be smoother now.\nCould you elaborate on your last comment?\n. Oh, well, in that case, I recently read the material guideline, although it doean't mention the text alignment, but it definetly mentions the support for right-to-left.\nThat being said, I guess this should be handled using either actual RTL layouts or using semantics on the text fileds.\nIMHO, providing the text alignment for title and placeholder would help on a wider range of needs, but you are the boss, you should decide on the compromise we have to make here.\n. Cool.\nOn Apr 29, 2016, 23:02 +0430, Daniel Dahannotifications@github.com, wrote:\n\n@mohpor(https://github.com/mohpor)We will make it work, I wanted to confirm the spec, that was it :)\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly orview it on GitHub(https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/342#issuecomment-215840765)\n. Great.\nIt will line up with Material Design Guidelines and everyone should be clear on them.\n\nP.S.: In regards to the announcement you've had the other day, about making it the standard library for Material Design for iOS, I guess we need a roadmap to (among many other things) be clear on how strict we're going to make this library in regards to Material Design Guidelines. Granted, it is essential to follow the guidelines the best we could, but I think we need to see how far it can go before it gets weird for developers to not have some basic UX/UI features they have with any given component. For example, the TextField component is something iOS developers always felt free to implement the way they felt was ok, are we going to let them have that much control? or they have to compromise either the library or their design? (hell of a P.S.!)\n. Wilco.\n. One last thing, divider doesn't have an ActiveColor property, is it intentional? if so, shouldn't it follow the placeholder's active color principles?\n. I think that's good enough. But the documentation should be clear on this.\n. Lots of developers (me included) may land on this library without having a solid understanding or knowledge of MD, keeping that in mind will help them.\n. Oh! see, I was looking for this info under PlaceholderActiveColor for some reasons! My bad.\n. Sorry about the delay. I sure will!\n. It's worth mentioning that the MTextField is TextField now. (Took me at least couple of pod updates to get that!)\n. I'm still testing it... Meanwhile:\nAs per our previous conversation, it's great to see that TextField totally adheres to MD principles and guidelines, but some flexibility could help. e.g. Detail label's position is too far away from the original text field for my taste (I know it is completely in accord with MD guidelines). I have a proposal. The proportional technique MD has suggested could be applied to this situation as well. Something like the SpacingPreset I have seen on other components. It could be great if we could have denser or more dispersed text fields. text field could layout it's placeholder, divider and detail label based on a spacing preset (which obviously is pre-set to MD's guideline). Just a simple idea, we should debate on it.\nAnother thing I missed is the way we could have two different values for Placeholder and title label (MD's name is Hint). I guess we should compromise either the smooth animation or this feature? I know it is not defined in MD, but it was nice all I'm saying.\nP.S.: How about a Gitter room for the Material iOS to talk about stuff like this?\n. I ran a test with the code excerpt you've provided and found that you are right about it. It seems that constraints cannot be made for map view (or because of the very complex internal layout system, layout cannot determine the size.). In anyway, if you use a top + bottom constraint for your card view, you'll be able to have your map view inside a card view:\ne.g.: \n//    MaterialLayout.alignFromTop(view, child: cardView, top: 200, )\n    MaterialLayout.alignToParentVertically(view,child: cardView, top: 200, bottom: 200)\nP.S.: use triple back-tick to insert a block of code or simple use the code block sign on the rich text editor on top of your input field to format your selected text as code block.\n. I wish you could share some code as well. Especially on how you are adding the cardView to the view hierarchy.\n. As far as I can see, the problem lies within this part:\nswift\ntableView.addSubview(cardView)\n    cardView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n    MaterialLayout.alignFromTop(view, child: cardView, top: 10)\n    MaterialLayout.alignToParentHorizontally(view, child: cardView, left: 20, right: 10)\nI'm not sure if the tableview is part of the navbar's view itself, but in any case, I think you need to implement a delegate pattern here and let the navbar's superview (which controls the main real estate of the view) to handle the card view's appearance.\nam I being clear enough here?\n. @craigpearce5 Swift is not that much different than ObjC as far as patterns are concerned, it's even simpler to implement them using Swift. But I get what you mean, it's a whole new ball game at the beginning. you see, you are trying to add a view to a part of your view hierarchy that covers only the navigation bar area. It is meant to hold that area only. It's because of it not masking to its bounds that you're even seeing that card view. you should add the card view to your main view.\n. just to be clear, is your table view on the same view as your navBar or you have a view controller for the table view?\nP.S.: Swift is the perfect language to start off learning to program.\n. that's right. they are essentially the same.\nWell, let me see if I can reproduce the problem.\n. try this:\nswift\n  let sView = view.superview!  \n  sView.addSubview(cardView)\n  cardView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n  MaterialLayout.alignFromTop(sView, child: cardView, top: 100)\n  MaterialLayout.alignToParentHorizontally(sView, child: cardView, left: 20, right:  10)\n. and while you're at it, Give the card view some more depth:\n``` swift\ncardView.depth = .Depth5\n``\n. ok,\nI have tested it myself, it sure will solve your problem.\nHave a good day at work.\n. have you tried to set thetitleLabelInsetPresetof the card view? it is defaulted toSquare2. there is adetailViewInsetPreset` available too. My guess is the second inset preset.\n. @theolof \nin a test project I have found that setting two parameters on card view should solve your problem:\nswift\n    cardView.contentInsetPreset = .None\n    cardView.detailViewInsetPreset = .None\n. @danieldahan this merge is much more than the title says. I'm not sure how those CGRectZeros got replaced with CGRect.zero, but they are welcome I guess?!\n. The hide animation is not right. lets have a better implementation later.\n. you can use the SWTableViewCell as normal, and while formatting your cell, slip a MaterialPulseView in the background or even set cell's backgroundView and selectedBackgroundView with MaterialPulseView.\n. try:\nswift\nmainToolBar = Toolbar(frame: CGRect.zero)\n. @craigpearce5 \nyou can create a container view and add whatever components to it and then set the detail view as that container view.\nBetter yet, you can use Grid to handle everything.\n. it's very simple:\n``` swift\n let detailView = UIView()\nlet segmentedController = UISegmentedControl()\n//Format segmented controller\ndetailView.addSubview(segmentedController)\n\nlet textField = TextField()\n// format text field\ndetailView.addSubview(textField)\n// correctly size the detail view\ncardView.detailView = detailView\n\n```\n. As a general rule of thumb, whenever an assignable view in Material is optional, it needs to be assigned by you and doesn't contain any view to add a subview to them.\n. you should set a frame for the container, I think\n. Give me a few minutes I will post a sample code for you.\n. Here it goes: \n``` swift\n let cardView: CardView = CardView()\nlet titleLabel = UILabel()\ntitleLabel.text = \"Title for the card view\"\ncardView.titleLabel = titleLabel\n\n\ncardView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n\n\nlet okButton = FlatButton()\nokButton.setTitle(\"OK\", forState: UIControlState.Normal)\nokButton.setTitleColor(MaterialColor.blue.base, forState: UIControlState.Normal)\n\n\nlet cancelButton = FlatButton()\ncancelButton.setTitle(\"Cancel\", forState: UIControlState.Normal)\ncancelButton.setTitleColor(MaterialColor.red.base, forState: UIControlState.Normal)\n\ncardView.rightButtons = [okButton]\ncardView.leftButtons = [cancelButton]\n\n\nlet detailView = MaterialView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 100))\n\nlet segmentedController = UISegmentedControl(items: [\"Segment 1\", \"Segment 2\"])\n\nsegmentedController.grid.rows = 4\n\ndetailView.addSubview(segmentedController)\n\n\nlet gapView = UIView()\ngapView.grid.rows = 3\n\ndetailView.addSubview(gapView)\n\nlet textField = TextField()\ntextField.placeholder = \"Enter Text here\"\ntextField.grid.rows = 4\ndetailView.addSubview(textField)\n\ndetailView.grid.axis.direction = .Vertical\n\ndetailView.grid.views = [segmentedController, gapView, textField]\ncardView.detailView = detailView\nself.view.addSubview(cardView)\n\nMaterialLayout.alignFromTop(self.view, child: cardView, top: 150.0)\nMaterialLayout.height(cardView, child: cardView, height: 200.0)\nMaterialLayout.alignToParentHorizontally(self.view, child: cardView, left: 12.0, right: 12.0)\n\n```\nthe gapView is in place for the room text field needs for placeholder to move up, there might be a better way for it. Tweak values to match your requirements.\nHope it helps\n. Right now panLeftViewGesture and panRightViewGesture are internal variables and you don't have access to disable them. We need to make them public.\nMeanwhile, you can subclass the SideNavigationViewController and override public func gestureRecognizer(_, shouldReceiveTouch touch) -> Bool function to return false.\n. @jongarate \nThere are a few things that come to mind after reading your code:\n1. if you are going to explicitly size the detailView and the scrollView, you probably can ignore the Grid part of the detailView. There is nothing particularly wrong with grid in this case, it's just not necessary anymore. \n2. Dynamic height UILabels need to be played out more carefully. If I had to do it myself, I would probably use a UITextView instead, and disable the edit functionality of it. TextViews handle multi line texts with their internal scroll view and therefor that scrollView becomes redundant.\n3. sizeToFit() needs to be called very carefully and almost after adding to view hierarchy so that layout system have some clue on how to decide on width and height of the text. When in doubt, calculate a text's bounds using functions like sizeThatFits() or other similar methods on String and NSAttributedString, or, alternatively, you could set preferredMaxLayoutWidth as a hint to layout system to calculate the text's size.\n4. You should set contentSize on scroll view to let it know how much area it should cover. all you're doing is to set the frame size of the scroll view. frame is the area that is visible on view, but content size is the area it holds inside.\n5. For further reading on sizing your UILabel follow this thread or similar ones.\nI hope it helps. Let me know if you needed more assistance.\nM.\n. I guess the actual output is more optimized now, plus, iTunes Connect can handle the slimming feature now.\n@danieldahan if you are going to test it, please first test with CP 0.39 then move to CP 1.0.\n. Could you post some code too?\nHow are you initialize your fabButton?\n. yeah, that would be nice.\nIf you're formatting your button in code, please add some of the code, and if you use only the storyboard, please add some screenshots.\nThanks a lot.\n. could you try and set the shape property of the fab button to .Circle in the viewDidLoad() of your view and see what happens then?\nswift\nfabButton.shape = .Circle\n. Hmmm.... It's interesting.\nI'm going to try and reproduce it in a test project, would be great if you could do that.\n. Ok,\nabout the view hierarchy, your fabButton is inside a MapView? does it especially flicker when you pan or zoom your map view?\n. What Material version are you using? Have you updated your pod recently? it is currently at 1.41.1\n. I can't really reproduce the issue myself, but I can suggest a couple of things:\n1. CallprepareView()inviewWillAppear()`\n2. Setup the fab button in code and see what happens.\n. So,\nI checked upon your sample project.\nThere is nothing wrong with it! I mean on device it never happens (Have you tested it on device too?).\nI saw it once, on simulator only, and after I opened up story board in xcode and saved it, it never came up on simulator too. It must be a glitch with Xcode's Interface Builder.\n@urizev Can you confirm that it happens on device or not?\n. @urizev have you tested it on device? Are you still seeing that square shape shadows?\n. As of 1.41.1 Toolbar doesn't need you to setup a label and assign to it, just format the toolbar's TitleLabel and DetailLabel however you like.\nGood luck.\n. @TheHmmka The toolbar's Wiki page is not reflecting the last version of Material. The whole documentation is being under reconstruction. Sorry for the inconvenience for now. I have used toolbar with 1.41.1 and it works like a charm. Would love to see some screenshots about it not having the correct layout any time you possibly could.\nCheers\nM.\n. @TheHmmka is this still an issue or we can safely close this issue?\n. There has been a few change in pulse animation and toolbar controls:\n- Pulse controls and views now have a new property to handle pulse: pulseAnimation which controls the way an item pulses, and the pulseScale option has been removed.\n- Toolbar doesn't need you to setup labels for title and detail label. You can now format the toolbar title and detail label however you like.\n. before, you would setup a UILabel and formatted it (font, text color, etc.) and assign it to the toolbar's titleLabel or detailLabel. \nNow, toolbar has the pre-formatted titleLabel and detailLabel. you just need to modify it to match your own formatting (font, text color, etc)\ne.g.:\nswift\ntoolbar.titleLabel.textColor = UIColor.White()\n...\n. Well, that's a whole another issue. I have submitted a pull request to solve it. it'll be fixed ASAP.\n. That's because the tile is getting centered to the available width. the only way I can think of, is to set content inset for the toolbar itself to compensate for right toolbar items.\n. It's always safer to update UI elements in viewDid[will]Appear(), especially when they've been designed in IB.\n@lancevalour Is it still an issue? Can we close this issue?\n. It's in the works, will be released shortly. For now you can use the development branch (with a solution to this) or revert back to Cocoapods 0.39.\n. BTW, here is how to use the development branch own your podfile:\npod 'Material', :git => \"https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git\", :branch => 'development'\n. Let me check.\n. I have checked on this.  I could reproduce it.\nA quick solution is to call prepareView() on your toolbar at some point (before or after adding to your view).\n. I have tested it, it should work. I will work on a fix though.\n. where are you setting the frame? viewDidLoad()?\n. Toolbar is a subclass of StatusBar they assume the device's width as their width. and changing the frame and laying out won't affect their actual width.\nIf you want to embed a toolbar inside a view with a width smaller than the device's, you should subclass the Toolbar and override the intrinsicContentSize() function and return the appropriate size for your view. You can use the super's intrinsicContentSize() and just change the width.\nAnd I think it's a good pattern to call the layoutSubviews() of the toolbar in your view's layout mechanism.\nLet me know if it you needed more explanation.\nCheers,\nM.\n. Here is the code I used to test my theory :\n`` swift\n// In a subclass otToolbar`\n  override func intrinsicContentSize() -> CGSize {\n    var size = super.intrinsicContentSize()\n    size.width = self.frame.width\n    return size\n  }\n```\n`` objc\n// In a subclass otToolbar`\n-(CGSize)intrinsicContentSize {\n  CGSize size = [super intrinsicContentSize];\n  size.width = self.frame.size.width;\n  return size; \n}\n```\nand it worked like a charm!\n. @TheHmmka you need to set a frame for your toolbar now. Height will have a default value, but make sure you set an appropriate width for the toolbar. It most likely will be its superview's width.\n. @TheHmmka That's right. You can init your toolbar with a frame or set its frame after init.\n. can you post a screenshot of the view debugger (with the troublesome line of code)? I want to make sure nothings covering the left controls.\n. Is there any caveat to do this?\ncould you check on my fork (development branch):\nhttps://github.com/mohpor/Material.git\n. @zgosalvez , @danieldahan Can you loop me in? I'm not sure about the setup resulting to this issue. I could reproduce it in my own way, but I'm not sure if that addresses the same problem here.\n. @zgosalvez Can you test your project against this pod to see if your issue is solved?\npod 'Material', :git => 'https://github.com/mohpor/Material.git', :branch => 'development'\nthanks\nP.S.: your sample project works with this patch.\n. Glad it helped.\nThere will be an appropriate fix for it ASAP.\n. Will be addressed in a new PR.\n. @tbergeron I have tested the sample code you have provided. it is easily reproducible.\nThe problem here is that you are calling becomeFirstResponder() too early in view's life cycle. Generally speaking, it's not a good idea to call view altering methods in the viewDidLoad() because the view is just being loaded and not added to the view. For the sample code you have provided, it's better to call the prepareTextField() in the viewDidLoad and becomeFirstResponder() in viewDidAppear() :\n``` swift\nclass FormViewController: UIViewController {\n  private nameTextField: TextField!\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    prepareTextField()\n}\n  override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    nameTextField.becomeFirstResponder()\n  }\nfunc prepareTextField() {\n    nameTextField = TextField()\n    nameTextField.placeholderActiveColor = MaterialColor.green.accent4\n    nameTextField.placeholderLabel.textColor = MaterialColor.green.accent4\n    nameTextField.placeholder = \"Plant Name\"\n    nameTextField.dividerActiveColor = MaterialColor.green.accent4\n    nameTextField.font = RobotoFont.regularWithSize(20)\n  }\n}\n``\n. @aemgtz Are you using Material in an objective-c project?\nif that's the case please follow this answer to resolve your issue: [dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26949219/2584090)\n. @chashmeetsingh I have tested your sample project. \nYou are usingsideNavigationControllerwhich is not initialized! in fact, those optionals arenilwhen you are calling transition methods on them. \nPlease follow the App form examples to see how sideNavigation must be used.\nCheers,\nM.\n. @jeandavid do you have a global Exception breakpoint? if so, could you disable it for now to see what's causing this to break?\n. I guess I know what's causing this. I will investigate some more and get back to you ASAP. Thanks for reporting this.\n. Could you elaborate more on the issue please?\n. What material version are you using? Have you updated to 1.41.3?\n. could you run apod updateand see what happens? Because I can see those properties in1.41.3`\n-> https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/releases/tag/1.41.3\n. It's a whole another issue. If you don't mind, please close this issue, move to a new issue with a complete description of the circumstances, including how this prepareToolbar() is getting called.\nThanks.\n. Plus, you can always use Material's Gitter channel to ask questions about implementations and unknown issues.\n. I guess what @chashmeetsingh is trying to achieve is something different, like touch outside to dismiss.\n. @saipnc what version of Material you are using?\n. v1.41.6 is the latest version, and it is a well known issue with older versions I guess. Could you upgrade to the latest version and see if it helps?\n. The image size should not be important. You can update your icon button's image view to adapt to the button's size:\nswift\niconBtn.imageView?.contentMode = .ScaleAspectFit\n. that would be wise. \n. dear @aemgtz, from what I see, your button's insets are meddling with the size of your icons. You can change the content inset and the contentMode (.ScaleAspectFill for example) to see if you can improve the situation.\n. @danieldahan will post a solution here soon.\n. @Elqul the imminent release will solve your problem :)\nThanks for your Patience.\n. @danieldahan, @akhilm3  Can we safely close this issue then?\n. @leobouilloux Hi :)\n could you elaborate more on the issue you're having?\n. This is easily solvable by setting a Frame for your toolbar.\nfor example:\ntoolbar = Toolbar(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: shareView.bounds.width, height: 32.0))\n. I can confirm that this is a valid issue.\nif you set isMotionEnabled to true, setting views' alpha prior to viewDidAppear would have no effect, meaning, the view will have an apha value of 1.0 upon view being displayed.\nIt seems MotionContext disregards view's alpha ater finishing with it. I need to investgate it some more, but I have very little knowledge on Motion, if @danieldahan could take a look, that would take less time.. My intentions were for the development branch. I guess some of the WIP\ncodes have been merged with development. I had to fix them before \npushing to the development branch.\n. @spot-developers \nCan you tell us more about the issue you're having?\nWhat method of integration are you using? (Cocoapods? Source?)\nWhat Branch are you on? Are you using development branch?\n. @LuckyFA \nThis is not directly related to Material. Please check if you are trying to Layout the TextField directly on a VisualEffectView.\nYou can follow up the issue by checking your stack trace and find the caller of this layout to see if the parent is a UIVisualEffectView or not.\nThanks. @alvincrisuy \nCan you provide us with the Swift Language Version build setting of your target?\nthanks. I guess the problem is that you are using 3.2, it needs to be 4. You can specifically set 4 to be used by Material (if you don't want all your pods to use Swift 4). just add the following code at the end of your pod file:\n``` ruby\nswift4pods = ['Material']\npost_install do |installer|\n   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|\n     if swift4pods.include? target.name\n       target.build_configurations.each do |config|\n         config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '4.0'\n       end\n     end\n   end\n end\n``\n. I'm glad it did.\nHave a nice day. @theolof \nIf you want your project to compile as Swift 4, you need to set Swift Language Version to swift 4 in **Target**'s build setting, not the project's.\nIf you do so, you don't need to set the pod's swift version in the pod.\nAm I missing something here?. Hope it helps with the migration to Swift 4.\nGood luck. @Shivaprabhu049 \nCould you elaborate on the settings of the workspace you are testing with?2.10.3is Swift 4 only. You need to either set your **Target**'sSwift Language Version` to 4, or \nset the swift version for Material pod in your pod file (see #889 - comment). @ybanezmarjune \nHave you seen #890?\nI think your issue might be related.. @quanguyen \nThis library is supporting both Xcode 9 and Swift 4 already.\nThanks. Could've built on these, but ok.. @jojonarte \nCouple of questions:\n1- How is it related to Material (Which components of Material are you using)?\n2- Could you provide us with a sample project that demonstrates the problem?\nThanks. In any case, there is an AVCaptureSession that's being stopped (a call to stopRunning()\nAll you need to do, is to call startRunning() on your capture session and it will unfreeze.. whoops, not again\n. this could move back up to the BarView itself.\nInstead of Default we could have Automatic (depending on orientation, might be interesting, especially if the preset gets back up to the BarView itself)\n. If user updates the toolbar height's preset, it should get laid out again? I thought so\n. empty init behavior change made some users confused. Added it to help them. Still ignores the super view's frame. We need to have a mechanism for bar's without an explicit frame being set to be able to snap to their superview's width. That needs some discussion.\n. A single line label with default font size has a 21px height, I used that in case a user wants to have a title only toolbar. I hope it is useful.\n. Default height x2.\n. I'm not entirely proud of this single line of code. Here is why:\n1. FrameHeight here means literally frame's height, unlike other options which include top + bottom insets.\n2. The reason I had to use the frame's height was that if I would've done say frame.height + insetHeight that would add up every time layoutSubview() gets called, because it would've updated the view's frame height and they add up to an unknown height! The only solution I could come up with, was to keep the original height somewhere and then use it in this case, that sounded hideous to say the least!\nAll being said, this need some more discussions.\n. I know it seems like a hack, but I couldn't find a better way to determine if user has set a new value for titleColor on a TabItem. ",

Shadows are usually performance intensive.\n\"Specify a Shadow Path When Adding a Shadow to Your Layer\nLetting Core Animation determine the shape of a shadow can be expensive and impact your app\u2019s performance. Rather than letting Core Animation determine the shape of the shadow, specify the shadow shape explicitly using the shadowPath property of CALayer. When you specify a path object for this property, Core Animation uses that shape to draw and cache the shadow effect. For layers whose shape never changes or rarely changes, this greatly improves performance by reducing the amount of rendering done by Core Animation.\"\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/ImprovingAnimationPerformance/ImprovingAnimationPerformance.html\n.

    "ghost": "@danieldahan any update on MaterialTabViewController? Thank you for all your hard work!\n. Yes, that's correct, I'm adding view controllers based on data received from a remote API. \n. Thank you!\n. Hello Daniel, \nSorry, I was setting the animated parameter to true on setViewControllers(), setting it to false fixed the problem.\nForce unwrapping should be fine, because it is assumed that fromVC and toVC will contain valid values.\nSorry for the inconvenience. \n. I agree, it's going to look ugly though since fromVC and toVC are not optional params. The following worked for me, are you okay with this as a PR?\npublic func tabBarController(tabBarController: UITabBarController, animationControllerForTransitionFromViewController fromVC: UIViewController, toViewController toVC: UIViewController?) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\n    let fromVC: UIViewController? = fromVC\n    let toVC: UIViewController? = toVC\n    if fromVC == nil || toVC == nil {\n      return nil\n    }\n    return .Fade == transitionAnimation ? BottomNavigationFadeAnimatedTransitioning() : nil\n}\n. Not working for me, it's not hitting that check.\n. Not sure why, but it's called when fromVC is nil, toVC is not nil, switching the optional to fromVC works.\n. That's right, I get the following warning in AppCode: \nWarning:(132, 14) parameter of 'tabBarController(_:animationControllerForTransitionFromViewController:toViewController:)' has different optionality than expected by protocol 'UITabBarControllerDelegate'\nFor my PR, I think I will convert to optional first, just in case, this way we're not changing the signature as provided in the delegate. I'll also stick to your style of value > property in the if statements.\n. Sorry, typo in PR.\n. Thank you for your help!\n. The method already exists. \nIf you're using MenuViewController use closeMenu(completion: (() -> Void)? = nil)\n. that worked, thank you!\n. Hi Daniel,\nAny news about making the PageTabBar scrollable when there is a lot of buttons?\nI would find that feature really interesting.\nThanks. Now I am pretty sure that the problem is with this:\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n        window!.rootViewController = AppSnackbarController(rootViewController: UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"RootViewController\"))\n        window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\nI cannot have that in my applicationDidFinishLaunching(). Why is this code there for a storyboard example rather having it load by itself by setting an initial view controller?. As of yesterday I sent you guys the xcode project! Thanks in advance!. Was just wondering if a solution was found for this? I've spent two hours messing with the code and storyboard but I just cannot get it to work without adding that code I posted at the top to my applicationDidFinishLaunching() which also overrides my whole storyboard configuration. What are the other options for doing it? I mentioned that I cannot use that AppDelegate code because it overrides my storyboard configuration. Adding in that code in the AppDelegate would just  make the app take you to the snakbar viewcontroller but without any way for me to access any of my other viewcontrollers.. Still getting same issue.. ",
    "Matungos": "Hi,\nI'm having this issue now with version 2.4.0.\nI've created a UIView programmatically, set 4 NSLayoutConstraints and then perform a Motion.translateY. \nVisually it works but events of views inside the UIView are attached to the old position.\nI've tried calling layoutIfNeeded before animate but doesn't work.\nWith UIView.animate(..) is working fine..

It seems to be working with those changes. But I've found another issue but I don't know if it is related to the newer changes.\nFor instance: http://i.imgur.com/ICueRYz.png I've draw a red circle in the zone where if I tap there, the clear button on the background receive the hit instead of the upper one, the one in the blue searchbar.\nThank you @danieldahan for your work.\nI can't help you more because I'm a newbie in iOS and I don't speak English very well :). I'll try to describe better.\nIn this case I have 2 search bars, one below the other.\nTapping the clear button of the top searchbar receive the tap normally.\nAt some moment I animate the bar on the background, but leaving they overlapped (purposely, if they are completely separated there is no issue, both tap callbacks are correctly called).\nTapping the same (top) clear button trigger the callback for the clear button on the bottom-background.\nI can update the previous sample project if you want.. I'm having this issue now. On simulator and on a device too.\n.

    "GreyEcologist": "Sure, I am using a asyncDisplayKit node \nfinal class TableViewCell: ASCellNode, MaterialSwitchDelegate { .. }\nSo the cellForRow equivalent is nodeforRow (I'm also using RAC):\nfunc tableView(tableView: ASTableView, nodeForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> ASCellNode {\n        var node = ASCellNode()\n        self.getStructSignal(index: indexPath.row)\n            .on(next: { value in node = tableViewCell(struct: value) })\n            .start()\n        return node\n    }\nand the code below is inside my node init() method, and the switch itself is placed inside a subnode:\n```\n        let followSwitch = MaterialSwitch(size: .Small, state: self.isFollowed == true ? .On : .Off)\n        followSwitch.center = CGPoint(x: Constants.kScreenWidth - 50, y: 32)\n        followSwitch.buttonOnColor = Constants.kWineShade\n        followSwitch.trackOnColor = followSwitch.trackOffColor\n        self.switchNode = ASDisplayNode(viewBlock: { () -> UIView in return followSwitch })\n        self.switchNode.preferredFrameSize = CGSize(width: 20, height: 20)\n    super.init()\n    followSwitch.delegate = self\n    self.addSubnode(self.switchNode)\n\n```\nEverything works, just the materialSwitchStateChanged() is being called when I scroll.\n. Hey guys, thanks for the help, I'm not an expert on async so I had to refresh my memory a bit but unlike regular table view cells the nodes don't implement reuse, the benefit is that they're initialized and laid out in a background thread before the view is laid out, and also the nodeForRow gets only called once and never again after that.\nInstead of implementing -tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:, your data source must implement -tableView:nodeForRowAtIndexPath:. This method must be thread-safe and should not implement reuse. Unlike the UITableView version, it won't be called when the row is about to display.\nIt was working for me last week, so prolly version 1.34.x or something, I'm looking into it right now.\n. Ok, so the issue I'm running into starts with the changes introduced in 1.34.6. I'll look into the changes now.\n. @danieldahan I can't tell from looking at the code, could be the changes in the setSwitchState(), but yeah, that's above my pay grade, lol. I do know the switch .ValueChanged behavior changed in 1.34.6. Hope that helps.\n. @danieldahan Hey Da I found it! The prepareView() had a gestureRecognizer, I couldn't see cuz it showed an empty function in the code compare but in the actual 1.34.5 code it had:\npublic func prepareView() {\n        addGestureRecognizer(UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: \"handleTapped:\"))\n    }\nThat function is also called to the two init() methods, when I add it to later version, my code works! Was it removed on purpose?\n. Hey, for me the gestureRecognizer calls the materialSwitchStateChanged() only when I switch it on/off. I could also add a target to the switch and listen for .ValueChanged events, either way work well for me when that handler is present, but neither work when it isn't there, as the .ValueChanged gets called whenever I scroll my tableview.\n. the handleTapped() was implemented in previous versions of the MaterialSwitch.swift:\n/// Handles the tap gesture.\n    internal func handleTapped(recognizer: UITapGestureRecognizer) {\n        if true == CGRectContainsPoint(trackLayer.frame, layer.convertPoint(recognizer.locationInView(self), fromLayer: layer)) {\n            setSwitchState(.On == internalSwitchState ? .Off : .On)\n        }\n    }\n. @danieldahan the issue is with the highlighted computed var: \npublic override var highlighted: Bool {\n        get {\n            return .On == internalSwitchState\n        }\n        set(value) {\n            setOn(value, animated: true)\n        }\n    }\nCurrently the MaterialSwitch highlighted property gets called when the ASCellNode, inside of which I am using the switch, calls its own highlighted property. If I remove this var from the MaterialSwitch, it behaves just like a UISwitch.  Updating the internalSwitchState works as well:\npublic override var highlighted: Bool {\n        get {\n            return .On == internalSwitchState\n        }\n        set(value) {\n            //setOn(value, animated: true)\n            internalSwitchState = value == true ? .On : .Off\n        }\n    }\nThe issue was that UIControl automatically calls this property when the control exit the screen:\npublic var highlighted: Bool // default is NO. this gets set/cleared automatically when touch enters/exits during tracking and cleared on up\n. Cool! Sounds good.\n. Works now! Thanks @danieldahan!\n. Thanks! Also, I should have mentioned that the context is that I am using a MenuView which contains two FabButtons.\n. I found a workaround, so I'll close this.\n. Sorry didn't see the question, I hide the button and use removeTarget() on the method I had associated via addTarget(). The issue with that workaround is that even when hidden the button target area still prevents any user interaction, i.e in my case the button covers a table cell view and clicking in the area when the button was doesn't register events.\nfunc hideSocialButton(menuView: MenuView) {\n        menuView.menu.close()\n        menuView.hidden = true\n        let first: MaterialButton? = menuView.menu.views?.first as? MaterialButton\n        first!.removeTarget(controller, action: #selector(self.handleMenu(_:)), forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)\n    }\n. Hey @danieldahan I know you have a lot of issues pending, but is there anything I can do to help fix this one?\n. @danieldahan Hey Dan, I sent a sample project reproducing the issue, please let me know when you had a chance to take a look.\n. Sorry... late to the party! Thanks guys!\n. Oh nice! That worked! I did have it my my viewDidLoad()\nThanks a lot Dan!\n. I'd like the hamburger and the search FlatButtons to align with the logo in the center of the Toolbar below. I tried changing the y properties when declaring the FlatButtons but that didn't seem to work.\n\n. Thanks, I appreciate that. FYI, I'm using a Toolbar as below:\n```\n        let menuButton: FlatButton = FlatButton()\n        menuButton.pulseColor = MaterialColor.white\n        menuButton.pulseAnimation = .None\n        menuButton.setImage(R.image.ic_menu_white()!, forState: .Normal)\n        menuButton.setImage(R.image.ic_menu_white()!, forState: .Highlighted)\n    let rightButton: FlatButton = FlatButton()\n    rightButton.pulseColor = MaterialColor.white\n    rightButton.pulseAnimation = .None\n    rightButton.setImage(R.image.ic_search_white()!, forState: .Normal)\n    rightButton.setImage(R.image.ic_search_white()!, forState: .Highlighted)\n\n    let navBar: Toolbar = Toolbar()\n    navBar.frame = Constants.kNavigationBarRect\n    navBar.leftControls = [menuButton]\n    navBar.rightControls = [rightButton]\n\n```\n. the setImage() methods contain the image, the R.image thing is just a library to keep track of images. I saw the change in alignment happening when I moved to 1.41.8 from 1.41.2. \n. Hey Dan, I found a way to set those elements. All good here!\nnavBar.grid.contentInset.bottom = 20\n. Ok, that makes sense. Then there's no issue, I just set up the contentViewController as such and that fixes it for me:\nlet nav: NavigationDrawerController = NavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: MasterViewController(), leftViewController: SettingsViewController())\n        nav.contentViewController.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor()\n        self.window!.rootViewController = nav\nThanks for the quick replies! \n. Hey Daniel, after some reviews it looks like the new Menu works fine, the issue I'm running into is after I apply the animations below, the frame of the Menu is not updated:\n```\n    func showingButtons() {\n        let first: Button? = self.socialButton.views.first as? Button\n        first!.animate(animation: Motion.animate(group: [\n            Motion.rotate(rotation: 3),\n            Motion.translationX(by: 120)\n            ]))\n    self.voteButton.animate(animation: Motion.animate(group: [\n        Motion.rotate(rotation: 3),\n        Motion.translationX(by: -120)\n        ]))\n\n    for subview in self.socialButton.views.enumerated() {\n           subview.element.frame.offsetBy(dx: 120, dy: 0)\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe socialButton is a Menu, the voteButton is a Button but they both have the same issue. If I remove the animation then all works fine, but with animation, after the animate() has completed, the frame of both remains in their original positions. \nWhich is weird because I can see the buttons in the simulators but nothing happens when I click on them (using a breakpoint and description shows the frame is out of the screen in the position before animate()).\nI've also tried animating the Menu directly rather than the subviews:\nself.socialButton.animate(animation: Motion.animate(group: [\n            Motion.rotate(rotation: 3),\n            Motion.translationX(by: Constants.kPadding + 100)\n            ]))\nSame results. It seems like somehow the animation updates the view but not the frame?\n. https://github.com/GreyEcologist/MaterialButtons\nIf you uncomment the lines inside the showingButtons() you can see the non-responsiveness.\n. @danieldahan Hey thanks for the layout tips, that make things a lot cleaner.\nHowever, when I click on the button after the animation it still doesn't respond, but I click on its former position, where the button was before the animation, then I get a response. I'm using Material 2.3.10.\n. Great!

    "MohsinN": "Hi,\nThanks, i did make a work around for it.\nAfter clicking on the button in Side nav, you can invoke the function in the main controller which can perform segue/ transition. Like this the stack for Navigation bar is maintained without any extra configuration. \nDont know if it is the best alternate but awaiting to hear a better solution as this approach can create a lot of clutter if there are many screens that have a side bar nav on them.\nCheers,\n. And also i had to add Navigation Controller as my main controller in the app delegate. This resulted in side navigation showing the in all the screens. So i had to explicitly disable it on specific screens where it was not needed.\n. I don't know what the proper way is but here it goes.\nIn AppDelegate.swift\n```\nfunc application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n    // Override point for customization after application launch.\n    // Get view controllers from storyboard\n    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\n    let mainViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"NavigationController\") as! NavigationController\n    let sideViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(\"SideNavViewController\") as! SideNavViewController\n// Configure the window with the SideNavigationViewController as the root view controller\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\nwindow?.rootViewController = SideNavigationViewController(mainViewController: mainViewController, rightViewController: sideViewController)\nwindow?.makeKeyAndVisible()\nreturn true\n\n}\n```\nHere the embedded UINavgationController is used, NavigationController is the the class used for referencing from storyboard. The basically makes the side nav visible through out the app.\nIn order to disable side navigation bar in each i used the following function.\n```\nfunc EnableSideNavigationBar(let enable: Bool){\n    let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate\nif let sideBar: SideNavigationViewController = appDelegate.window?.rootViewController as! SideNavigationViewController{\n\n  sideBar.enabledRightView = enable\n\n}\n\n}\n```\nPerforming segue directly from the side navigation bar resulted in disappearing of the navigation bar. I could not find a plausible explanation or alternate for it. So i had to call the func of the active uicontroller to perform segue. This resulted in proper handling of navigation stack.\nI had six screen on which there was side nav, one way was to add segues from each screen to another that created a lot of clutter. So i ended up using the segues currently present from main menu to all six others. It was surprising to me that you can use the segues of the screen that is not visible, i could not find reason for it in documentation or maybe just i am new to this.\nAlso i would love to contribute to the project, please let me know if i can help in any manner. \n. Thanks, really appreciate it. Also i would really like to contribute to the project. please let me know if there are any possibilities.\n. I will be honest, i am new to swift but i have a knack for problem solving and in love with material design.

    "OrkhanAlikhanov": "I think the UIAppearance is a bit outdated for swift. It will require the dynamic keyword for every property in order to be eligible for Objective-C.. @danieldahan and @jbaez I created a separate issue for this. #1092 . Hey! Not yet. Not in the priority. It is possible to implement but still requires some dedication to decide what to put under which subspec. It's not a tough work but I don't think it's relevant time to start working on this. A PR is more than welcome though ;). I thought I tried to set navigationItem.backButton.tintColor \ud83e\udd14 but obviously didn't. @danieldahan Well, actually I tried to set it globally, in AppNavigationController. I think there should be something like default back button color in order to set it once instead of setting color in every ViewController.. Please, do not forgot pulse color :). @danieldahan I do that of course, my request was about the UINavigationItem.backButton.tintColor globally.... So again, how can we change tintColor of the backButton in a global level? I don't want to do that in every view controller that I push.. I don't want to change the sources either, to insert just one line:\nswift\nitem.backButton.tintColor = navigationBar.tintColor. Shouldn't the backButton.tint Colorbe equal to navigationBar.tintColor by default? I think it is the default behavior in UINavigationController that UIKit offers. . By the way, what I am discussing here is also applying to navigationItem.titleLabel.textColor.. Let's move the discussion to the that feature request. #292 . @danieldahan they don't work though.\nI set toolbar.backroundColor to .clear. Can this be the case?. Do you think that it is worth including forceShadow() method  into the library for whom did backgroundColor = .clear? . @danieldahan Noone seems to have the same feature request that I had last year. But I can implement this or we can just close the issue. What do you say?. It's only this. You may assign me to the issue.. They stay static while back button is moving with above view controller. Maybe back Button is handled by the iOS API?. OK got it, the point that I was overlooking is that I was anticipating the below viewController's leftViews and rightViews to be animated as well while that of above viewController's were animating. However, the default UINavigationContoller does not do this as a design. I apologize for wasting time  :/\nNote: above and below viewControllers refers to the viewControllers that are in sight when we are moving the finger left and right performing back swipe gesture.. @danieldahan I investigated this issue a bit with PresenterCard.tar.gz sample that @theolof had attached. The project was using version 2.4.16, I tested with it and latest one, both was kinda misbehaving when View is used. I couldn't find the cause of this. I am attaching a minimal project showing the so-called bug. Here is how it looks, red ones are View instances whereas blue ones are UIImageView instances.\n\n. I fixed my issue by adding boolean shouldPrepareItem and setting it to false when I don't need it. But I still want to know the wisdom behind the prepareItem :)\n``` swift\ninternal func layoutNavigationItem(item: UINavigationItem) {\n    guard willLayout else {\n        return\n    }\nif shouldPrepareItem {\n    prepareItem(item: item)\n}\n\n...\n}\n``. What is actually the three dots (...) appearing? Just curious :). This is not a solution but you can play withplaceholderVerticalOffsetproperty.. Same here, I haveTabsControllermanaging 2UIViewControllers withtableView. When transition happens the scroll bars appear. UsingMaterial 2.10.1. @danieldahan I tested [the project](https://github.com/gilthonweapps/testMaterial) and I confirm that this no longer persists after Material 2.13.0 (Motion 1.3.0). [Motion 1.2.5](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/tree/1.2.5) had this bug, but the next release [1.3.0](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/tree/1.3.0), where you reworkedMotioninternals, fixed this issue. So the issue can be closed, thank you all!. As a workaround you can subclass it and return customintrinsicContentSize.. I don't see any memory leak in theMaterialTest.zipproject attached.\nTested with:\n* Xcode 9.3.1\n* iPhone 6s simulator\n* iOS 11.3. Well, actually I opened an issue here so that when someone encounteres the same problem, he/she can search for and find a way out. . @AtherSajjad When did that happen? Let's discuss this at [CosmicMind/Material gitter](http://gitter.im/CosmicMind/Material). Basic things from [UITabBarControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitabbarcontrollerdelegate) would be enough I guess.. Thank you for your support \ud83d\udc4d . Great ^^\nFor your information, you can make issues get closed automatically in commits. For example, you can commit like this: Added TabsControllerDelegate. Closes #859\nThe issue #859 will be automatically closed as soon as the commit becomes the part of master branch. An example commit\nHere is docs. . @danieldahan Thank you!. Actually it would be better to inherit from UIButton I think. . I am confused, why was PR made to the wip-checkbox-radiobutton branch? I guess it should've been made to the development branch.. @danieldahan As I understand the problem was that when you moved the codes from development to the wip branch you forgot Base.swift. \n@mohpor now I understand your concern. Thank you!. Same here .... @markst I haven't updated to the latest Material yet. I still have some pods that don't support swift 4.. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/2bd5e6089c0a14140509e0cec65b5d9351711ec4/Sources/iOS/TabBar.swift#L455-L472. Can't this behavior be achieved through setting UIImageView to leftView and rightView?:\nswift\ntextField.leftView = UIImageView(image: Icon.favorite)\ntextField.rightView = UIImageView(image: Icon.favorite). @danieldahan I guess @ndlinh is right. I was suspicious about the commit https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/ea0e0027b20ec19244f391f95b812839fcb55799 when I see it. . @danieldahan In code you only check #available(iOS 11, *). I guess, the issue is non-ios11-specific :) . @danieldahan I confirm that this issue no longer persists after Material 2.13.4. It was fixed when you fix #1016 in https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/cf88010a46778f7fb98a29ebb6d63632cfc75f2b. That's correct, and I think there is no need to declare convenience init(). It should work without.\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/68e44743466162fe03466a1f5df635c7fb808f81/Sources/iOS/View.swift#L159-L163. You can add Material+UIView.swift manually to your project. . Sounds easy to me. Will look into today. . @danieldahan Material 2.16.1 has the requested feature added. The issue can be closed.. @danieldahan Can we close this? Because #1038 is merged and is said to solve this issue.\nIt would be better to get feedback from @shemchavez though.. Let me add docs as well. @adamdahan Thank you for the review, I'll refactor the code according to your suggestions at this weekend inshaAllah . @Recouse If you want the component, drag and drop the files into your project and import Material framework for every file:\nswift\nimport Material\nIf a file does not compile add @testable import Material because I've used some internal things in some files.. Made PR for this #1082. #1082 is merged in, so next release gonna have this feature.  For the usage guide see the PR description. Thank you!. \n@multinerd This is what is happening in the sample project you've attached. The plus button on the right is a UIBarButtonItem (and is misaligned). We don't support using UIBarButtonItems with the Material's NavigationController. If I remove that UIBarButtonItem it back button stays in its place. You should be using an IconButton on the navigationItem.rightViews instead. You can check out NavigationController sample for usage. Thank you!\nNote: As a recommendation of mine to you, use programmatic approach for complex projects, storyboards are time consuming and hard to maintain.\n. Thank you, I needed this, haven't tested yet.. @seubseub I recommend you following Swift Style Guide (by raywenderlich.com). @seubseub Sorry, I didn't do my first review thoroughly it was late at night. . @seubseub I just noticed that your branch is 3 commits ahead, 18 commits behind CosmicMind:master. You'll have to rebase origin/master and resolve merge conflicts before the PR becomes mergable, which will add one more commit. I think the PR is becomes dirty. I don't know what @danieldahan thinks in this matter. \nPersonally, I would delete all the commits in this PR rebase to CosmicMind:master and redo the changes and git push --force. If force update does not work I would close this PR and make another clean one-commit PR.. @adamdahan private struct is a good idea, I would apply that.  But I've seen @danieldahan himself using magic numbers and some magic variables throughout all the framework :]. Hey @danieldahan, I actually started a while ago moving those magic numbers into a private struct under meaningful names as suggested by @adamdahan. @adamdahan Let's discuss this at gitter. Yeah, that was design decision. There is no more DialogBuilder we removed it in favor of separate Dialog object. You can use DialogBuilder code from this PR, or work directly with DialogController just like DialogBuilder does.\nswift\nlet vc = DialogController<AppDialogView>()\n///configure vc.dialogView\npresent(vc, animated: true). It has been quite a while since this PR is made, I don't think it should be merged because of two reasons. First, if we want to support voiceover, we should do it in all components (not just on ErrorTextField) which adds a support headache. Secondly, this addition is not demanded that much by the community. So, let's close this.\nHaving said that, it can be achieved by subclassing ErrorTextField.\n```swift\nclass MyErrorTextField: ErrorTextField {\n  override var isErrorRevealed: Bool {\n    didSet {\n      if let error = error, isErrorRevealed {\n        // Announce what is happening to VoiceOver users\n        UIAccessibility.post(notification: .announcement, argument: error)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}. #1046 had been merged, so the next release gonna have this.. @danieldahan It seems this PR causes not to compile? Can you verify please?. https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1046/commits/f22face7bf6686ec289df46d5b8c1d34e1cc03d4 is totally fine, something had to do with merge. I review both (@mjurenka's and GitHub's merge) commits  and they seem okay. But the changes shown in Files Changed tab it does not reflect the 2 commits in this PR. it looks really weird and causes compilation error.. I would go with the second option. Making changes ourselves. I can make a PR for that if you agree. . Hey, I can confirm that it's not internal and never been. So it can be subclassed.\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/dd741ff01a13be2bb45d47b256290be42511f361/Sources/iOS/TransitionController.swift#L34\nActually it can never be internal because other open classes like TabsController inherits from it and you cannot give higher access level in subclasses to the types that have lower access level (at least in swift).. Hey @danieldahan, this is the issue we discussed recently. It should've been solved in #1082 \n@cody1024d, you are right it should be detailLabel.frame.width not bounds.width\n. #1086 is merged in, so next release gonna have a fix, thank you for finding this!. Hey @phlippieb , thank you for your contribution. I would go with your first option. Which I guess what you meant should look like this, but with 2-spaced indention just like other parts of the file:\n```swift\npublic override convenience init(rootViewController: UIViewController) {\n  self.init(rootViewController: rootViewController, navigationBarClass: NavigationBar.self)\n}\npublic init(rootViewController: UIViewController, navigationBarClass: AnyClass?) {\n  super.init(navigationBarClass: navigationBarClass, toolbarClass: nil)\n  setViewControllers([rootViewController], animated: false)\n}\n```\nIf @danieldahan approves either option, You may remove the commit rebase development branch again and reapply changes and do one clean commit. To be honest, I am not sure about the second option.. Demo project to play: demo.zip\n. Somewhat related to #1041 because of implementation changes.. @danieldahan Regarding #1041, does setting isErrorRevealed have to fire UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification? Can it have some side effects? \nWe can add option something like shouldPostAccesibilityNotificationWhenErrorRevealed: Bool, or maybe add a method like setErrorReveal(_ isRevealed: Bool, postAccessibilityNotification: Bool) to control posting that notification. Or we can simply delay it until someone asks for.. @danieldahan  we can merge autoValidateOnlyIfErrorIsShownOnce to autoValidationType by introducing new case there. What do you think?. Latest demo project. demo.zip\n. @autumnssun Sorry but you seem to not understand me.  We really appreciate your contribution. If you want to discuss this feel free to comment here or write to me at gitter. Otherwise, I am afraid we had to close this PR as it gets dirty and may break other things.. That's true, handleSwipeGesture() calls select(at:index). \nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/955cec565892d7b3b14c7dc84cfccf3b31c4ca1a/Sources/iOS/TabsController.swift#L380-L386\nSo, we need to change select(at:index) signature to decide whether it should fire delegate methods or not. @danieldahan  What do you think?  Should't select() fire delegate methods by default? Or we should add option to fire that? Which guide should we follow?\n@autumnssun Actually there is no need to close and recreate PR, you can reset all the commits and do one-clean commit if you want. But I think we can keep this as well since commit history does not bother @danieldahan as it bothers me, lol.\n. Xcode version?\nMaterial version?\nCocoaPods version?. Material 2.0.0 is released on October 1, 2016 and 752 commits have been made to master since that time. Latest version is 2.15.0 as of now. Can you try and let us know if the issue persists in the latest release?. Interesting. Can you try to integrate it to a brand new project and see if it fails to compile again? It suspect it arose after updating to Xcode 9.4, which I don't and won't have in the near future to check this issue. . Thank you. It would be great if you attach that project here. . Sure, there is. Material defines .podspec. So you can import it:\nruby\npod 'Material', '~> 2.0'\nYou may want to look into installation guide.\n. Can you share those errors with us, so that we may help?. Great! That's probably because of Podfile.lock. You shouldn't actually. It will be generated anyways when you do pod install.. Hey! Follow #575. Hey! That's only possible by subclassing currently. Set dividerContentEdgeInsets.left = 0\nswift\nclass MyTextField: TextField {\n  override func layoutSubviews() {\n    super.layoutSubviews()\n    dividerContentEdgeInsets.left = 0\n  }\n}. @albertml How do you animate it? Can you attach a sample project for us to test?. Well, we can't help this way. Can't you create a sample project?. Thank you for reporting this. To me, it's really weird that actively requested images are deleted from GitHub's CDN. @danieldahan You can contact GitHub if you want but we can obtain and re-upload images from a cached copy which was crawled on 8 January, 2018. Hey! I don't know why you want to change tabbar line width, but that does not work because the line width changed via animation:\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/6b989a48aeb1317411396b8ea970a15a45e29e9b/Sources/iOS/TabBar.swift#L602-L603\nWhen you tap a tabItem or swipe the controller, above code is called. Motion works with CoreAnimation which animates view from old values to the new values on presentationLayer and sets the new values back to the actual layer/view when animation is done. So changing tabBar.line.width won't work because what's actually shown on the screen during animation is presentationlayer and after animation is done values of presentationLayer will be passed to the actual layer/view.. Actually there is hackish way to achieve what you want. Since the frame of the line is calculated from tabItem itself, we can tweak tabItem properties before animation is fired and set it back before layout cycle happens:\n```swift\nclass MyTabsController: TabsController, TabBarDelegate {\n  override func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n    tabBar.delegate = self\n  }\nfunc tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, willSelect tabItem: TabItem) {\n    let desiredWidth: CGFloat = 100\n    let w = tabItem.frame.width\n    let x = tabItem.center.x\ntabItem.frame.size.width = desiredWidth\ntabItem.frame.origin.x = x - desiredWidth / 2\n\nDispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.01) {\n  tabItem.frame.size.width = w\n  tabItem.frame.origin.x = x - w / 2\n}\n\n}\n```\n@danieldahan What do yo think maybe we should add something like:\nswift\nfunc tabBar(tabBar: TabBar, lineWidthFor tabItem: TabItem) -> CGFloat. Well, that sounds reasonable. Can tabItems have different widths? If so, then lines can also have different widths based on tabItem's width. So, we need another case accepting closure for dynamic calculation.\nswift\nenum TabBarLineWidthStyle {\n  case auto\n  case fixed(CGFloat)\n  case custom((TabBarItem) -> CGFloat)\n}\nUsage:\nswift\ntabBar.tabBarLineWidthStyle = .auto\ntabBar.tabBarLineWidthStyle = .fixed(100)\ntabBar.tabBarLineWidthStyle = .custom { tabItem in\n    return tabItem.bounds.width - 20\n  }\nWhat do you think?. @danieldahan I confirm that FABButton has no depth after https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/commit/b90ee8ac753685ba5027e157449dde7c5ebf85bb as explained in the issue.\nBasically we have no control over layer.masksToBounds property as it's overridden on layout cycle. Only workaround is to subclass FABButton (or any affected component) and change the property there.\nswift\nclass FABButton: Material.FABButton {\n  override func layoutSubviews() {\n    super.layoutSubviews()\n    layer.masksToBounds = false\n   }\n}\n. @danieldahan Let's close this and reopen when I start working on this feature. Hey! Can you share detailed information how it breaks your UI? which parts? I assume it breaks the NavigationBar, in this case you can disable it like this:\nswift\n(navigationController.navigationBar as! NavigationBar).isThemingEnabled = false. Theming is applied for UIViews when they are created, and for UIViewControllers in viewDidLoad(). This allows us to override theme in prepare (after calling super.prepare) or after creating the view. \nThere are only two exceptions where theming is re-applied. One is UINavigationItem which is themed when it gets laid out, and the other one is Toolbar, which is re-themed when rightViews, leftViews or centerViews are changed. Both respects isThemingEnabled. \nTo disable theming for the entire app, you can make isThemingEnabled to return always false for now. Just replace line 178 with return false \nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/e26faf0c57a0aaa2aae3bb64504a369fad780d60/Sources/iOS/Theme.swift#L176-L181\n. @MuhammadNayabButt Can you send an example project replicating the issue? You can send it to support@cosmicmind.com. Hey! Thank you! It will be in Material 3. It's been implemented in #1021 but merged to m3 branch not the main branch. You can add the files from PR to your local if you want to use it. Hey! Thank you for reporting this. It's my bad. We'll fix this soon. Thank you for your investigation. I've sent a PR. See #1120. Hey! The site is under development right now. You can take a look at Sample Projects to get your project started.. Thank you! We'll look into this soon. I think if you disable  isScrollEnabled and set relevant constraints, it will behave like that.. @danieldahan By disabling isScrollEnabled we lose ability to scroll. I think we can introduce preferredMaxLayoutHeight, allow growing upto that point and scroll after.. >but after pushing to another controller it is not respecting preferredStatusBarStyle value from ViewController\n@ashusath Which ViewController? First or second? Can you send over a sample project replicating the issue?. @danieldahan You can now close #834 in favor of new Editor component added in this PR. . @moazkh60 Hey, thank you for reporting this! ErrorTextField has changed a bit by #1082. Now, instead of showing error in detailLabel we show it in new errorLabel. So setting isErrorRevealed = true hides detailLabel and shows errorLabel. Update your code to use errorLabel and error: String? instead of detailLabel and detail: String?. @Parilar You changed from UITabBarController to BottomNavigationController or from TabsContoller?\nAmong those, only TabsContoller has swipe gesture feature (which is with animation). \nBottomNavigationController is direct subclass of  UITabBarController, I don't believe we can easily add animation to it. I need to take a look at though.. Hey @chonex42race! I am also fan of @danieldahan's work :) \nWhen you present AppToolBarController it gets loaded and viewDidload is triggered. On the subsequent presentation of it, however, you are presenting an already loaded controller. So, since it is already loaded, there is no point in loading it again.\nI don't know why you are presenting your new view controller hierarchy instead of making it the rootView by replacing LoginController. Here is how I set this up:\n```swift\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n\n    window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n\n    restart()\n    return true\n}\n\nfunc restart() {\n    let keyWindow = UIApplication.shared.keyWindow!\n    let controller = createRootViewController()\n    keyWindow.rootViewController = controller\n\n    controller.view.alpha = 0.7\n    UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {\n        controller.view.alpha = 1.0\n    }\n}\n\nfunc createRootViewController() -> UIViewController {\n    return isAuthorized ? createMainViewController() : createEntryViewController()\n}\n\nfunc createMainViewController() -> UIViewController {\n    let vc1 = UIViewController1()\n    let vc2 = UIViewController2()\n    let tabControllers = UITabController(controllers: [vc1, vc2])\n\n   let toolbar = AppToolbarController(rootViewController: tabControllers)\n   let leftVC = LeftSlideViewController()\n\n    let appToolBarController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController: toolbar,\n         leftViewController: leftVC,\n         rightViewController: nil)\n\n    return appToolBarController \n}\n\nfunc createEntryViewController() -> UIViewController {\n    return LoginController()\n}\n\nvar isAuthorized: Bool {\n    return !App.defaults[.token].isEmpty\n}\n\nstatic func restart() {\n        (UIApplication.shared.delegate as? AppDelegate)?.restart()\n    }\nstatic func logout(restart: Bool) {\n    App.defaults[.token] = \"\"\n    if restart {\n        self.restart()\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nOn successful login set App.defaults[.token] = \"token-from-server\" and call AppDelegate.restart(), when you logout call AppDelegate.logout(restart: true).\n\nApp.defaults is just a wrapper around UserDefaults, but you should not , as oppose to above example, keep token in UserDefaults instead store it in keychain.. Added in #1165. Hey! Thank your sharing your issues with us!\n\nhidesBottomBarWhenPushed is only for BottomNavigationController (which is subclass of UITabBarController). TabsController does not support it, but yeah, we should add that option I think.\nInstead of tabBar.isHidden = true, do displayStyle = .full\n. Ah, sorry @Hamna21, I've forgotten to answer. \nTabsController is more like of an Android tab activity, it adds scrolling when number of tabs are greater than total tabs that fits into the width and tabItem title is laid out to next to the imageView rather than bottom of the imageView. \nBottomNavigationController does not add any NavigationController  whatsoever.. Hey! Try pod install --repo-update. Thank you, we'll take a look at shortly!. @davidevincenzi Hey! Thank you for sharing your issue with us. It seems there isn't any way to achieve that using Material's Layout system. We will probably rework it to add support for that. Thank you! . Hey @davidevincenzi! It's coming in #1185! \nWith new update you can achieve what you asked in this issue:\nswift\nview.layout(firstLabel).top(100).right(10).left(10)\nview.layout(secondLabel)\n      .top(firstLabel.layout.bottom, 30)\n      .leftRight(firstLabel.layout.leftRight). As far as I remember navigationItem.title and navigationItem.{left|right}Views can only be manipulated via code. That's a limitation.. @CHONUMAN Please send us a project that replicates the issue.. I believe this is solved via https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/121#issuecomment-420444249. Hey! The website is under development right now. See #1121 . @CHONUMAN We investigated the issue, with help of @danieldahan, it turned out that the sample is actually setting tabItem instead of tabBarItem. \ntabItem is used by TabsController, whereas BottomNavigationController uses tabBarItem. So, you should change all tabItem into tabBarItem and the sample will work as it's meant to be :)\nAlso, when you override viewDidLoad() make sure that you call super.viewDidLoad() otherwise prepare() method will not be called. Thank you!. I confirm that dividerColor and tintColor are working, but heightPreset don't.\nAs for depthPreset, it creates shadow below of the view. Since the tabBar is already at the bottomest place we don't see any shadow at all. To see shadow, we need to make it point upwards.\nswift\ntabBar.depthPreset = .depth5\ntabBar.layer.shadowOffset.height *= -1 // flip direction\n\nWe decided to make depthPreset directional. So to cast shadow above of a view, you will do:\ntabBar.depthPreset = .above(.depth5)\nWe will also add support for heightPreset. Thank you!. Your convenience init is not used to initialize the NavigationController, so preparetabBarItem is not called during init. Override the initializer you are using, which is init(rootViewController:) in your case.\nAlso prepare() is an alias for viewDidLoad(), use one at a time, and always call super.prepare() or super.viewDidLoad() when override\n```swift\nclass ContestNavigationViewController: NavigationController {\noverride init(rootViewController: UIViewController) {\n    super.init(rootViewController: rootViewController)\n    preparetabBarItem()\n}\n\nrequired init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n    fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n}\n\noverride func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n    guard let v = navigationBar as? NavigationBar else {\n        return\n    }\n\n    v.depthPreset = .none\n    v.dividerColor = Color.grey.lighten1\n\n    navigationBar.tintColor = Color.red.accent4\n    preparetabBarItem()\n}\n\n}\nextension ContestNavigationViewController {\n    fileprivate func preparetabBarItem() {\n        tabBarItem.titlePositionAdjustment = UIOffset(horizontal: 0, vertical: -4)\n        tabBarItem.image = UIImage(named: \"tabHomeIcon\")?.tint(with: Color.grey.base)\n        tabBarItem.title = \"HOME\"\n        tabBarItem.selectedImage = UIImage(named: \"tabHomeSelectedIcon\")?.tint(with: Color.red.accent3)\n    }\n}\n. @CHONUMAN Simply implement it in your `ContestNavigationViewController`:swift\n    override init(nibName nibNameOrNil: String?, bundle nibBundleOrNil: Bundle?) {\n        super.init(nibName: nibNameOrNil, bundle: nibBundleOrNil)\n    }\n```\nThis is well-known: \n\nUnlike subclasses in Objective-C, Swift subclasses do not inherit their superclass initializers by default.. Hey! For questions, use stackoverflow with cosmicmind tag or our gitter channel\n\nFor NavigationDrawerController you'll have to define your hierarchy in code, see NavigationDrawerController sample. NavigationDrawerController should be the topmost controller generally.\n```swift\nlet homeVc = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"HomeViewController\")\nlet tabsVc = AppTabViewController(viewControllers: [HomeNavigationController(rootViewController: homeVc), SearchMediaViewController()])\nwindow?.rootViewController =  AppNavigationDrawerViewController(rootViewController: tabsVC, leftViewController: nil, rightViewController: DrawerViewController())\n```. Hey! No need to overpraise me :) Thank you for your appreciation.\nYou can set isHiddenStatusBarEnabled to false. Default value is true.. @CHONUMAN Hey, we you can call navigationDrawerController?.closeRightView(). It's available for leftView as well. You can check NavigationDrawerController.swift out for more info.. @Ronaldoh1 Hey! For questions, use stackoverflow with cosmicmind tag or our gitter channel\nHow do you set it up? Please share some code. Hey! Can you share a minimal sample project replicating the issue?. @shroff-kandarp You are using UINavigationController, that's how it behaves when navigationBar.isTranslucent is true (default is true). It extends the rootViewController. You can set navigationController.navigationBar.isTranslucent = false or in your controller self.edgesForExtendedLayout = [] to prevent extending. And also, we recommend using NavigationController instead of UINavigationController.\nThat said, @danieldahan what do you think, should we default edgesForExtendedLayout = [] for TabsController perhaps when alignment is .top?. @shroff-kandarp We decided that we keep it as it is, since it's default behavior of the system when using UINavigationController. That said, you should use Material's NavigationController instead of UINavigationController.. Hey! Can you share a minimal sample project replicating the issue?. Latest code is a little bit different, we have tabBar.select(at: index) there:\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/c9fb3f6f3067ddc869ca6128b5e4e5a783075688/Sources/iOS/TabsController.swift#L399-L432. The code I pointed is from development branch. It might not be in release. Hey! How do you set height of TabBar?. Try:\nswift\ntabBar.heightPreset = .normal. @danieldahan We cannot support tabBar.frame.size.height = x. Because we do tabBar.frame.size.height = tabBar.heightPreset.rawValue + y in some places. If we change tabBar.heightPreset.rawValue to tabBar.frame.size.height, the code would be equal to tabBar.frame.size.height += y which would cause infinite growing/shrinking of tabBar depending on the y. \nHowever, we can add tabBar.heightPreset = .custom(x). What do you think?. @Hamna21 Sorry for late response, I checked all were working fine. Can you try again, we've just pushed a tiny fix in #1167. Can you go to inspector on storyboards and reset the class again? And make sure your outlet connection is not broken.. Interesting, this is reproducible with development branch. Just create a brand-new project, I add view to view controller in storyboards and set its class to FABMenu. Running the app prints following:\n\nUnknown class _TtC8Material7FABMenu in Interface Builder file.\n\nI tried various ways to fix the issue none worked so far. Haven't tried with latest Xcode 10 yet.\n@danieldahan Issue can be reopened I believe. Alamofire request is asynchronous, the data probably comes after the tableview is populated. You should call reload tableView data once it's fetched. In PostsViewController, call your request and sync and then reload table.\n```swift\nopen override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    // some code\n    let graph = Graph()\n    graph.clear()  \n    let c3 = Entity(type: \"Category\")\n    c3[\"name\"] = \"Notifications\"\nAlamofire.request(\"https://sample.com/data.json\").responseJSON { response in\n    if let JSON = response.result.value{\n        if let jsonResult = JSON as? Array<Array<String>> {\n            for data in jsonResult.reversed() as Array {    \n                let a5 = Entity(type: \"Article\")\n                a5[\"title\"] = data[0]\n                a5[\"detail\"] = data[1]\n                a5[\"photo\"] = UIImage.load(contentsOfFile: \"photo2\", ofType: \"jpg\")?.resize(toHeight: 300)\n                a5[\"content\"] = data[2]\n                a5[\"author\"] = UIImage.load(contentsOfFile: \"photo8\", ofType: \"jpg\")?.crop(toWidth: 24, toHeight: 24)\n                a5.is(relationship: \"Post\").in(object: c3)\n                print(data[1])\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    DispatchQueue.main.async {\n        graph.sync()\n        self.reloadData()\n        self.tableView.reloadData()\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```. @M47H3W Did your problem get solved?. @MuhammadNayabButt Can you send a sample project replicating the issue?. You can share zip file here or send it to support@cosmicmind.com. Thank you!. Hey! Thank you! The site is under development right now, and will be available soon with new cool stuff. \n1121\n. Can you share your hierarchy setup code here? A sample project would be more desirable though. Thank you!. I looked into your setup, TabsController does not support storyboards. You have to setup hierarchy through code. Just continue to create individual tabs in storyboards, but to nest them in TabsController, init them from storyboards with some identifier then use TabsController(viewControllers:) to create TabsController. Thank you!. Something like this:\n```swift\nextension UIStoryboard {\n    class func viewController(identifier: String) -> UIViewController {\n        return UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: identifier)\n    }                 \n}\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\nvar window: UIWindow?\n\nlazy var leftViewController: BlueViewController= {\n    return UIStoryboard.viewController(identifier: \"BlueViewController\") as! BlueViewController\n}()\n\nlazy var brownViewController: BrownViewController = {\n    return UIStoryboard.viewController(identifier: \"BrownViewController\") as! BrownViewController\n}()\n\nfunc applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ application: UIApplication) {\n    window = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\n    let tabs = TabsController([blueViewController, brownViewController])\n    window!.rootViewController = UITabBarController(viewControllers: [tabs])\n    window!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n}\n\n. Hey, you can use development branch until we make a release. We're trying so hard to do so. Thank you!. Can you send over a sample project replicating the issue? Thank you!. @karasahinemre You can manually update `tabBar` position for now, until we come up with a better solution.swift\nclass AppTabsController: TabsController {\nvar navBarFrameObserver: NSKeyValueObservation!\n  open override func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n    tabBarAlignment = .top\n    navBarFrameObserver= navigationController?.navigationBar.observe(.frame) { [weak self] nav, _ in\n      self?.layoutSubviews()\n    }\n  }\noverride func layoutSubviews() {\n    super.layoutSubviews()\nguard let navBar = navigationController?.navigationBar  else {\n  return\n}\n\nlet additionalInset = max(0, navBar.frame.height - 96)\ntabBar.frame.origin.y += additionalInset\n\n}\n}\n``. Hey! There is no such feature yet, but it's planned and will be implemented. Thank you! . We are close to release. Check outdevelopment` branch for now.\n1157. Use development branch for Motion as well.\nruby\npod 'Material', :git =>'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git', :branch => 'development'\npod 'Motion', :git =>'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion.git', :branch => 'development'. Hey! How do you add your custom view to textField.rightView ? Can you share some code? A sample project replicating the issue would be welcomed :). Thank you, looking at the source code, it seems rightView gets resized based on views that are in rightView.grid. \nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/6dc1048c419d5ed5989852605518b6e3be6ea5db/Sources/iOS/TextField.swift#L612-L621\nIf you add your custom view to grid, rightView.grid.views = [temp], it should work. However size of the your custom view temp will be overridden by grid system.. That's because we calculate width of leftView differently leftViewOffset + bounds.height:\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/6dc1048c419d5ed5989852605518b6e3be6ea5db/Sources/iOS/TextField.swift#L106-L116\nYou can override our calculation to give 10 points left padding as follows:\n```swift\nclass myTextField: TextField {\n    override func layoutSubviews() {\n        super.layoutSubviews()\n    leftViewOffset = -bounds.height + 10\n}\n\n}\nlet fullnameField = myTextField()\nfullnameField.placeholder = \"Full Name*\"\nfullnameField.backgroundColor = UIColor.white\nfullnameField.leftView = UIView()\n```\nOr override leftViewWidth return your hackish padding.\nswift\nclass myTextField: TextField {\n    override var leftViewWidth: CGFloat {\n        return 10\n    }\n}\nThis padding will also be reflected on divider line.\n\nIf you don't want divider line to be padded you can just inset the text using textInsets property which is available in development branch right now.\nswift\nlet fullnameField = TextField()\nfullnameField.placeholder = \"Full Name*\"\nfullnameField.backgroundColor = UIColor.white\nfullnameField.textInsets.left = 50\n. @danieldahan What do you think in this matter?. @pedroOliveiraptc Can you share the code for us to achieve the same result on our computer?. Thank you we'll look into soon.. @pedroOliveiraptc You have following line:\nswift\nUIView.appearance().semanticContentAttribute = .forceRightToLeft\nIt makes some changes internal to UITextField: \n\nFrom: #WWDC15 App Frameworks\nWe give padding as much as the height of the textField if leftView has non-nil value. Since leftView is swapped with rightView internally when you have .forceRightToLeft, accessing leftView returns non-nil value (value of rightView) therefore we add padding. You workaround this by setting rightView to nil:\nswift\nlet textField = TextField()\ntextField.rightView = nil // so that when it gets swapped with leftView, leftView still stays nil\nActually we don' support RTL yet, so we don't test our framework against such cases.\nbtw, you can use development branch, it has cool updates such as Theming (#1115) and Dialog (#1173) :). Hey! Thanks! Can you send a sample replicating the issue? . @rob-keepsafe if you believe this an issue, please open new one with any information you can provide . Absolutely! Probably next week it will be in the development branch. Thank you!. @kerem1905 It's already in development branch.. #1173 is merged, dialogs are in the development branch \ud83c\udf89. Pretty soon. You can use development branch for now. . Use development branch of Motion as well. \nruby\npod 'Material', :git => 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git', :branch => 'development'\npod 'Motion', :git => 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion.git', :branch => 'development'. It's caused by #1185.\nUse this until we add it back:\n``swift\nextension Layout {\n  @discardableResult\n  func size(_ size: CGSize) -> Layout {\n     return width(size.width).height(size.height)\n  }\n}. @CHONUMAN AddTheme.isEnabled = falsein yourAppDelegate.swift` file to resolve color conflict. I don't know why this is happening with storyboard users even though I've tested and it was working. \nWe plan to have different modules for Material but it's not a priority right now.. We are now very close to release. You can point to the previous commits I believe. Not tested but should work:\nruby\npod 'Material', :git => 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git', :commit => '4ab1b08c3365a00f409a210162ae72ed8425f299'\npod 'Motion', :git => 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion.git', :commit => '3141bdb87e30b4aa899a22562194a221ea2da388'. @MuhammadNayabButt Hey! Could you please define does not work well?. Hey! See https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1131#issuecomment-411734473. Interesting. How and where do you set text for labels? Can you send a sample reproducing the issue?. That probably happens since it does not layout errorLabel. You can layout by calling textField.layoutSubviews()\nI suggest that instead of textField.errorLabel.text = \"blah\" use textField.error = \"blah\", we internally call layoutSubviews. Awesome! \nI believe we should call layoutSubviews internally when isErrorRevealed is set as we were doing before. It was removed in last update, that's why you ran into this issue.. @evagnostic Check out new validator for ErrorTextField #1082. You can set validation rules and error messages on errorTextField.validator and check if they pass using errorTextField.isValid(). There is more detailed information in the pr.\nBasic example:\nswift\nlet usernameField = ErrorTextField()\nusernameField.placeholder = \"Username\"\nusernameField.validator\n  .notEmpty(message: \"This field is mandatory\")\nand then\n```swift\nfunc didTapSignIn() {\n  guard usernameField.isValid() else {\n     return // relevant error message is shown automatically.\n  }\n// sign user up\n} \n. Hey! Thank you! Most likely it happens due to theming #1115. We'll look into this soon. For now, you can add `Theme.isEnabled = false`  to your `AppDelegate.swift`. It is introduced in #1174. To use it point to that branch. Assuming you are using cocoapods:ruby\npod 'Material', :git => 'https://github.com/OrkhanAlikhanov/Material', :branch => 'theme-global-disable'\n``. See #1183 . Hey! Nice catch! Thank you! Can you please do this for allNSKeyValueObservations in the project? I believe we have few more.. @danieldahan will merge it once he gets here :). Hey! To be honest, I did experience that somehow, but was never able to find steps to reproduce it, can you share a sample project replicating the issue?. Fixed in #1183 . The changes are indevelopmentbranch. You need to have Xcode 10 and swift 4.2 to use them. See https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/1172#issuecomment-429267021. @MuhammadNayabButt Thedevelopmentbranch will eventually be merged tomaster, but we have no exact schedule. As for color issue (#1176), it's introduced by theming #1115  you can useTheme.isEnabled = falsein yourAppDelegate.swiftfile to disable it.. Hey! You will have to change the hierarchy order. Instead of nestingUITabBarControllerinsideNavigationDrawerController,  makeUITabBarControllertopmost and nest each tab inNavigationDrawerController. Share the hierarchy here. I've done something similar. As far as I remember I used delegate of NavigationController to prevent popping both via gesture and back button. . Fortunately, I had added my solution as an answer in SO. Check if it works for you. https://stackoverflow.com/a/41912394/5555803. Well, we can actually extendUINavigationControllerDelegateproviding something likeshouldPopmethod. . @SDGMazeGeek No, swipe back feature is left as it is (turned on). Thank you!. There isn't any way right now. We'll probably rework some parts of{Check,Radio}ButtonGroupto add delegations etc. in the future. We can add this feature at that time.. This is because of theming #1115. You can disable theming at all byTheme.isEnabled = falseor disable it for specific instancenavigationBar.isThemingEnabled = falseor all instancesNavigationBar.isThemingEnabled = false. Hey! How do you set your view withTabBar?. Can you send us a sample reproducing the issue?. Hey! Sorry for the breaking change. It's now calledcenterY. See #1185 for more details. Hey! Most likely it happens due to theming #1115. You can addTheme.isEnabled = falseto yourAppDelegate.swift` to disable it. See also #1174.. > when I disabled the Theme, the navigation bar color turns black which is supposed to be white\nHmm, that's a regression. Before default color was .white, currently it's expected to be set by theming, but when theming is disabled it sets noting my default.\nYou can check the removed line:\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/1115/files#diff-b2493560b26f2b7a682624a8d8178015L171\n. Unfortunately, the best thing is that you disable theming and set white color on navigation bar manually.. Theme.light.primary = .white should've done the trick (providing that you do it before Theme.current is accessed). Which buttons turned into white in buttons navigationItem or others? Did you explicitly set black color on them?. Hey! Did you find solution or accidentally closed the issue? . Thank you! We'll look into soon.. This is great @vivi7. I always wanted to have them in sync. I don't know what @danieldahan thinks on this matter. Also, can you update the PR against development branch?. Cool thank you! I am making a clone to verify the changes and check if it builds :) . I think this should be isSwipeEnabled with letter d at the end. if isSwipeEnabled { would be more clean. What about dropping parentheses and self.s ?\nswift\nguard (selectedIndex + 1) < viewControllers.count else { return }. You can omit UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection actually\nswift\nswipeLeft.direction = .left. Same here, UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection can be omitted.. prepareSwipeGesture() adds gesture recognizers to the self.view. And it is called when isSwipeEnabled is set to true. But it is not removed when isSwipeEnabled is disabled. This will lead to issues when a developer decides to change the value isSwipeEnabled after he has set it to true.\nswift\n1. vs.isSwipeEnabled = true // adds gesture recognizers\n2. vs.isSwipeEnabled = true // will adds gesture recognizer again\nswift\n1. vs.isSwipeEnabled = true // adds gesture recognizers\n2. vs.isSwipeEnabled = false // will not disable swiping, the `vc` will still be swipeable. Actually there is no need to subclass NSObject. You mean it should be like this?\nswift\n(code: ValidationClosure, message: String)\nI actually changed my mind, I think all msg  parameters in the function signatures should be in full form. What do you say?. By the way, should I call removeTarget somewhere, like in deinit? I couldn't find answer. Note that textField is weak.. Actually isErrorRevealed name was in ErrorTextField even before my changes. I kept the name same. Also note that errorLabel.text has convenience field var error: String? just like detailLabel.text can be changed by var detail: String?. I mean that field is error not errorMessage. Should I still rename to isErrorMessageRevealed?. Actually I tried to avoid code duplication here. errorColor is declared as:\nswift\n/// Error text color\n@IBInspectable\nopen var errorColor = Color.red.base {\n  didSet {\n    errorLabel.textColor = errorColor\n  }\n}\njust like detailColor: open var detailColor = Color.blue.base\nInstead of setting it to Color.red.base again in prepareErrorLabel(), I set it to the same value it was given by default by doing errorColor = { errorColor }()\nShould I still change that?. It couldn't. Having default value in errorColor does not call didSet. We need didSet to be called in order to set errorLabel.textColor. I updated my above comment to add full definition of errorColor.  Actually it would be better to make errorColor a property not a field. But it looks a bit dirty I think. So I defined errorColor like you defined detailColor. So, I keep this as it is.. @danieldahan you've approved and merged #1046 but I think these \"should\" delegate methods should be called when action is triggered by user interaction. What do you think?. @danieldahan You might wonder why I didn't use Int. As far as I remember, using it was causing crash on 32-bit devices. Even on iPhone 4s simulator for example. I can't verify since I don't have 32bit simulator and won't be able to get it soon. Can you please try it with Int or UInt. With UInt32 it works I am sure. But it will fail to compile with Int32 when a large interger value is used. e.g UIColor(argb: 0xFFFFFFFF). I have to use value or I can use for example size?. Does set get order matter?. Yeah sure, I know. I meant larger in terms of positivity. Thank you for explaining :). I removed unnecessary tinting image here because visibilityIconButton.tintColor was set before and is enough.. swift\nvisibilityIconButton?.image = visibilityIcon\nThis identical line is in 3 places, should I reduce it to updateVisibilityIcon() method?. I think I should doing right now.. Ah, next time I'll double check for _. I just let XCode format those lines. Not sure if I understood but will keep track of your changes :). I am not sure about naming. I didn't understand the reason, but Motion requires center point? It feels counterintuitive. . Inline documentation would be desirable. I check this to allow user to set custom UITabBar class via stroyboards.. I'll update the code to follow the convention. In swift, assignment operation never returns assigned value. So a = b = c is not possible nor if currentIndex = -1 {} will compile.. - DialogView - UIView subclass that implements dialog layout.\n- DialogController - UIViewController subclass that manages DialogView.\n- DialogBuilder - Delegate between developer and DialogController (Dialog API).. swift\npublic typealias Dialog = DialogBuilder<DialogView>. Excellent point! Agreed, we should stick to our guidlines and provide delegates rather than callback closures.. Actually I deliberately marked only show method with discardableResult in order to ensure developer that he does not forget to show the dialog.\nswift\nDialog()\n  .title(\"Don't forget to show\") // #warning unused result.\nswift\nDialog()\n  .title(\"Don't forget to show\")\n  .show(self) // no warning. Well, those 3 are buttons.\n\nCancel corresponds to Neutral button, Agree to positive and Disagree to Negative button.. What do you think?. Yes. The only way to change height of a snackbar is to use heightPreset. The height of a snackbar can be greater than value of heightPreset because of the fact that we are increasing it depending on layoutGuide values. Using heightPreset instead of height prevents snackbar from infinite growing which would be caused by added layoutGuide values.. ",
    "juvs": "Sorry for the delay... \nUsing textField.detailLabelAutoHideEnabled = false and later when done the validation manually call textField.detailLabelHidden = true or textField.detailLabelHidden = false depending the result of validation.\nI see this more like a workaround, because the normal behavior works ok for \"normal\" textfields. \nThanks for you help\n. Excellent! Works ok, did you check point 2, maybe I should open a separate issue?. Already attach a sample and a url video. Correct! I record from emulator (iPhone 6 - iOS 10.3), I try on a real phone and works like a charm, but you never know... at least there's evidence and maybe is not a real \"user\" scenario. Anyway thanks for your \"pronto\" feedback... \n:thumbsup: :thumbsup: for this great framework!!!. Agree!. ",

    "posaninagendra": "Hi @danieldahan \nThank you very for the reply, when can this is be updated in the library? \n. @danieldahan, yes the TextField issue is important thanks :) \n. @danieldahan thank you very much!\n. @danieldahan in my case the titlaLabel once the text field becomes the first responder goes up and if nothing is typed it should come back right once the text field is out of focus but it is not coming back.

If you could fix this it would be great. \n. Hey, @danieldahan \nAfter going through your code, I figured out that by setting the test field data programmatically the delegate methods are not getting invoked.

Actually, we wanted to move the library to the latest version to use the updated depth in card views, but since the Text Field titleLabel has caused the problem so we rolled back to a previous version where is was working. Since you have fixed those issues, we can make use of card view depth as well, if you could release the new Text Field implementation in the latest build.\n.

Therefore (?) the buttons lives outside the toolbar. The toolbar is green.\nAny suggestions/solutions? I'm pulling my hair about this, I really need to get this to work.... I can solve it somewhat by adding the buttons directly to the rightViews:\ntoolbar.rightViews = [checkMarkButton, ignoreButton]\nbut then some large spacing occurs, see below.\n\nThe same happens if I add a View directly to the rightViews/leftViews instead of wrapping the View in a UIView - it then sits nicely inside the toolbar, but the spacing gets messed up.\n\n. toolbar.contentViewAlignment doesn't have a property .left, only .full or .center and they don't help me.\nI'm also not using titleLabel or detailLabel in this case. I need a View in the middle to handle clicks on different parts, and different font styles.\nHere's what I'm trying now:\n```\nprofileImageView = View()\nprofileImageView.shapePreset = .circle\nprofileImageView.image = profileImage.resize(toWidth: PROFILE_IMAGE_WIDTH)!\nactivityTextLabel = TTTAttributedLabel(frame: CGRect.zero) // tried with a regular UILabel - no difference\nplaceImageView = View()\nplaceImageView.shapePreset = .square\nplaceImageView.cornerRadius = 2\nplaceImageView.image = placeImage.resize(toWidth: PLACE_IMAGE_WIDTH)!\ntoolbar = Toolbar()\ntoolbar.interimSpacePreset = .interimSpace6\ntoolbar.leftViews = [profileImageView]\ntoolbar.centerViews = [activityTextLabel]\ntoolbar.rightViews = [placeImageView]\n```\nIt looks like this:\n\nMaybe it's not possible to do what I'm trying to do? I'm using the toolbar in unintended ways?\nMy goal is to make it look something like this:\n\n. Didn't find the time today, but I think I can do it tomorrow. Cheers.. Here's a sample. I modified your PresenterCard sample.\nPresenterCard.tar.gz\nThis is the result:\nAlso notice that the right image is skewed, it should be a globe.

Yes, it's still behaving the same.\nI'm not using the toolbar due to this (though I would like to, for convenience). Yes, I got it to work. Had to set the height of the detailView, i.e. detailView.height = 300.. I think I got it...\nIn ViewController1 I need to use menuController.tabBarController?.navigationItem to set the navigation title and menuController.tabBarItem to set the tab bar properties\nIn ViewController2 I need to use tabBarController?.navigationItem to set the navigation title and tabBarItem to set the tab bar properties\nCorrect?. I'll close this, but it's a lot of work setting the title of the navigation. That's maybe iOS, and not Material? Let me know if there is an easier way.\nIn one ViewController, I need to do this:\nlet navItem = tabBarController?.navigationItem\n        navItem?.title = \"TITLE\"\n        navigationItem.title = \"TITLE\"\nbecause the tabBarController isn't always there (multiple ways of reaching the ViewController). And in another ViewController I need to do this:\nlet navItem = menuController.tabBarController?.navigationItem\n        navItem?.title = \"TITLE\"\nsince the ViewController is wrapped in a MenuController.. I had this issue, but I changed the controller to a UIViewController with an embedded UITableViewController instead.\nI also made sure the UITableViewController was aligned to the bottom layout guide, instead of self.view:\nview.addSubview(tableView)\nview.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(item: tableView, attribute: .top, relatedBy: .equal, toItem: view, attribute: .top, multiplier: 1.0, constant: 0))\nview.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(item: tableView, attribute: .bottom, relatedBy: .equal, toItem: bottomLayoutGuide, attribute: .top, multiplier: 1.0, constant: 0))\nIt also works for me with this:\nview.layout(tableView).edges()\nMaybe any of that that helps.\n. If you're using Controllers, you need to set the rootViewController somewhere. Take a look at http://www.cosmicmind.com/danieldahan/application-architecture-with-material, it may help. You may need to read it two or three times to understand it, I know I did.\nYour SplashScreen needs to be part of that hierarchy.. @danieldahan Hehe, I'm not sure how to make it easier to understand... Maybe more examples and what they lead to. It was complicated for me because my mindset was \"I want to show a snackbar when I click this button\", but that's not the way it works :-) and it took a while to understand what happens when adding controllers in a certain order.. The width for .small is also smaller than intended\nThis is my Switch:\ntheSwitch = Switch(state: .off, style: .light, size: .small)\ntheCell.layout(theSwitch).right(16).top(16).bottom(16)\nwhich leads to\n\nThis is the Switch from https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material#switch\n\n. Ah, thanks. I didn't know that the target doesn't inherit from the project. Hopefully it'll work now.. Compilation error:\n/Users/...ActivityCell.swift:237:9: Ambiguous use of 'addAttributes(_:range:)'\n. ",

    "tbergeron": "Uh actually the navigation controller works sometimes.

I think there might be an issue with icons altogether?\nI pulled the App example and here's what I see: \n1: http://d.pr/i/13TNi\n2: http://d.pr/i/11IVG\n. For the icon part I guess this is related https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/231\nEDIT: Once I dragged the Assets from your repo to the Pods, I started to see icons. So I guess you still have issues with icons+cocoapods hehe\nStill the Add button isn't working, I cannot set any titles for the navigationbar so I guess I'm still doing it wrong hehe\n. I've been able to set the NavigationBar's title this way:\n```\nlet navigationController : NavigationController = self.navigationController as! NavigationController\nlet navigationBar : NavigationBar = navigationController.navigationBar as! NavigationBar\nnavigationBar.topItem?.titleLabel.textColor = FlatWhite()\nnavigationBar.topItem?.titleLabel.text = \"That Title!\"\n```\ne.g. http://d.pr/i/1baDm\nI feel I'm forcing my way through the process LOL :P\n. Hi! I'm using the latest 1.41.1.\nSo I'd need to use Material 0.39.* right? Or is that the CocoaPods version?\nThanks\n. Awesome! I'll do so!\nI played with the App demo, it's the NavigationController side of things I'm having a hard time with. Though after playing more with the App demo I've been able to progress a bit more with the UI side of things. Thanks for helping me out and good night!\n. Downgrading Cocoapods fixed the icon issue straightaway.\nIt almost work well now except for the non-working \"Add\" UIBarButtonItem and the title-less pushed views i.e. http://d.pr/i/8YR1 and also I clearly feel I'm doing something wrong just take a look at the left UIBarButtonItem here http://d.pr/i/11ukL\nLooking at the App example, I'm feeling I use the storyboards \"too much\" and I should implement more of the navigationcontroller/bar stuff from the code instead. I'll keep playing with that demo, I feel I'm getting pretty close to having it working.\nMaking progress! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Checking the source greatly helped me understand how it works. Updated docs will be even better! Thanks a lot for all your work!\nFrom checking out the demos, I'm starting to believe I should stop using Interface Builder and lay everything down from the code. I always did this with other languages but storyboards made me think I'd like to use UI instead of code. I wonder how difficult it would be to rewrite my app with code instead of IB...\n. After thinking about it, this is what is called on that event:\nPretty sure that my EHPlainAlert call is what is messing it up. This is showing a bottom alert so maybe that alert view/animation is the one taking over causing the lack of button pulse animation in my scenario.\nfunc waterButtonPressed(plant: Plant) {\n        // check if any notification existing for plant, to cancel it\n        let app : UIApplication = UIApplication.sharedApplication()\n        for oneEvent in app.scheduledLocalNotifications! {\n            let notification = oneEvent as UILocalNotification\n            let userInfo = notification.userInfo! as! [String:AnyObject]\n            let plant_uid = userInfo[\"plant_uid\"]! as! String\n            if plant_uid == plant.uid {\n                app.cancelLocalNotification(notification)\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        // schedule notifications\n        self.scheduleNotificationsForPlant(plant)\n        // alert user that plant has been watered\n        let alert = EHPlainAlert.init(title: \"title\", message: \"message\", type: ViewAlertSuccess)\n        // display alert\n        alert.show()\n    }\n. Weirdly enough it persists after commenting it. Even commenting the whole thing changes nothing.\nI can even keep the notification i.e. http://d.pr/i/1cdBq\nWhat messes it up is my self.tableView.reloadData() call that is after that notification call.\n. Incredible! Thanks @mohpor, that's very logical and explains perfectly why it was happening. It's now working smoothly!\n. ",

Here is my work around solution. \nYou have to subclass the NavigationDrawerController and override the receive touch delegate then add the condition to cancel  touch event for specific view type.\n`\nimport UIKit\nimport Material\nclass AppNavigationDrawer: NavigationDrawerController {\noverride func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldReceive touch: UITouch) -> Bool {\n    if (touch.view?.isKind(of: IconButton.classForCoder()))!{\n        print(\"Cancel touch when view is IconButton\")\n        return false\n    }\n    return super.gestureRecognizer(gestureRecognizer, shouldReceive: touch)\n}\n\n}\n`. I tried with Material 2.12.19. \nThis issue doesn't occur anymore. \nThank you!\n. ",

I just updated Material library in our App (it's been a while since we haven't updated), and also noticed the placeholder label was positioning higher than before (overlapping with some other elements in some cases).\nWe have some custom components that where using the same logic as the Material.TextField for showing the placeholder, detail label and other material styling. Looks like what has changed is using bounds instead of frame for y position:\nNew TextField in layoutPlaceholderLabel line 574:\nplaceholderLabel.frame.origin.y = -placeholderLabel.bounds.height + placeholderVerticalOffset\nWith the old logic it would have been:\nplaceholderLabel.frame.origin.y = -placeholderLabel.frame.size.height + placeholderVerticalOffset\n\nAbove, the new TextField placeholder showing too high. Below, is our custom component using the old logic which shows the placeholder right up of the TextField.\nReverting line 574 to use frame instead of bounds fixes this issue.. @danieldahan  I created a fork to fix this issue so it works as before in our App. Let me know if you want me to send a pull request.\nhttps://github.com/jbaez/Material/commit/2d147b3bb161e1fbabff5e00eac41d460d10ca67.

    "ConfusedVorlon": "just posting so that github notifies me when you get time to do this work. Thanks in advance.\n. I just tried with swift 3. \nFirst build gave me this warning:\n`\u201cUse Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.``\nI'm using cocoapods, so I tried setting 'Use Legacy Swift Language Version: NO' in the pods project. That gives me a gazillion errors.\nIf I switch to 'Use Legacy Swift Language Version: YES', then I only get about 6 errors which relate to code changes in swift 3.\nI'd suggest you need to create a separate 3.0 branch with a view to dropping 2.3 support fairly quickly.\nThe changes seem fairly minor. Things like:\nbezierPath.CGPath -> bezierPath.cgPath\nalso, there seem to be duplicates in some of the extension definitions. I don't know if that is allowed in 2.3, but 3.0 complains \ne.g. public func resize(toWidth w: CGFloat) -> UIImage? {exists in Material+UIImage.swift and also Material+UIImage+Resize.swift\n. @danieldahan something odd here; I just tried downloading the material project, and it seems to build fine.\nThis is what I'm using for my podfile:\npod 'Material', :git => 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git', :branch => 'development'\n. @danieldahan I have pinned down at least part of the issue. There are files in the cocoapod which are not included in the Material framework project.\ne.g. AnimateKeyframe.swift\nthis might need nothing more than cleaning out some obsolete files...\n. I got it to build by removing \n-AnimateKeyframe\n-Material+UIImage+Resize.swift\n-Material+UIImage+TintColor.swift\nI'm guessing at least the last two of those were refactored into Material+UIImage\nI suspect this isn't an issue of xcode cleaning files, but rather the pod trying to compile every file in the folder where the material project only compiles the files which are included in the project.\n. @danieldahan I think there may still be a couple of files in the pod that are still on swift 2.3\n1. install pod\n2. build (everything is splendid)\n3. close workspace\n4. reopen workspace\nXcode now 'discovers' some files that are on swift 2.3 and offers to convert them to 3.0\nIf you run through the wizard, it will show you what it wants to change\nthanks.\n. slow response here - I'm on beta 3. I still see the offer to upgrade whenever I open my project!\n. good to know. \nDo you have any suggestions for workaround or timing on a fix?\nI can just avoid using the fab button in my colour selector if I need to.\n. awesome - thank you!\n. thank you\n. this handles issue #488 (and I also need it myself!)\n. Any thoughts on this? I'm going to be submitting a build as soon as the iOS 10 gm comes out which should be soon. It would be nice to not have to update my fork!\n. looks like a relevant blog post here - might be helpful\nhttps://miqu.me/blog/2016/11/28/app-extensions-xcode-and-cocoapods-omg/. thanks for getting to this - you do fantastic work on this whole project :). yup - I'm using it now! Thank you.\n. note - I'm using today's head, on xCode 8 beta 6.\n. it is implemented by the UIStackView.\nThis is mentioned in the UIStackView docs here\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIStackView_Class_Reference/\n```\nYou can animate both changes to the arranged subview\u2019s hidden property and changes to the stack view\u2019s properties by placing these changes inside an animation block.\nOBJECTIVE-C\n// Animates removing the first item in the stack.\n[UIView animateWithDuration:0.25 animations:^{\n    UIView * firstView = self.stackView.arrangedSubviews[0];\n    firstView.hidden = YES;\n}];\nSWIFT\n// Animates removing the first item in the stack.\nUIView.animateWithDuration(0.25) { () -> Void in\n    let firstView = stackView.arrangedSubviews[0]\n    firstView.hidden = true\n}\n```\n. Ok - I did some digging. Slightly updated debug project attached:\nbuttonDeath 2.zip\nThe StackView is simply telling the view to shrink - it does this by setting an autolayout width constraint of zero.\nI found a couple of issues that are causing this to not work nicely.\n1) when you set a width constraint for a fab button where width != height - the image shrinks, but the background layout (circle) does not.\nYou can see this by tapping the 'shrink' button.\nClearly you weren't expecting non-round fab buttons! Might a transform do the job here for non-round cases?\n(LayoutSubviews is getting called here with the frame width == 0)\n2 Something wierd is happening when the button is expanded again.\nFor my debug view (just a regular UIView), layoutSubviews is called when I expand - and the frame is set to 45,45\nfor the FabButton, layoutSubviews is called after the expansion, but the frame is 0,45 when the layoutSubviews is called.\nthis explains why the image doesn't get displayed after the layout (it is still zero width).\nIf I look at the view debugger - then the view does expand to 45,45.\nhowever - I can't figure out why layout isn't getting called after the size change. If I try making a regular button hide/show, then it behaves properly.\nI can work around this partially by using a completion block on the animation\nUIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {\n        self.plane.isHidden = !self.plane.isHidden\n        self.debug.isHidden = !self.debug.isHidden\n        self.shrink.isHidden = !self.shrink.isHidden\n    }) { (complete) in\n        self.plane.setNeedsLayout()\n        self.plane.layoutIfNeeded()\n    }\nthis triggers another layout pass, and the image shows properly. \nby a process of random hacking, I have identified the problematic function, though I'm not sure exactly how to fix it:\nopen override func layoutSublayers(of layer: CALayer) {\n    super.layoutSublayers(of: layer)\n    if self.layer == layer {\n        //layoutShape()\n        layoutVisualLayer()\n    }\n}\nand specifically, the problem within layoutShape is setting the frame:\n```\n    open func layoutShape() {\n//        if .none != shapePreset {\n//            if width < height {\n//                frame.size.width = height\n//            } else if width > height {\n//                frame.size.height = width\n//            }\n//        }\n    if .circle == shapePreset && width != 0 {\n        cornerRadius = width / 2\n    }\n}\n\n```\nIf you comment out these lines, and don't let the cornerRadius get set to zero when the width is zero, then the layouts get called correctly, and the shape shrinks - although it isn't perfect.\nclearly this isn't a proper fix - but hopefully it gives you some clues!\nI know that modifying frame when autolayout is doing its thing is problematic with UIViews, and I suspect the same is true with the layer...\n. that does the trick - thanks.\n. the easy fix at the moment is just to use .init(frame:.zero) and skip the convenience initialiser\nthanks again.\n. that was quick!\nthanks.\n. I'm just manually removing the relevant files. \nIt means that updating the pod is a pain - but it isn't a big deal.\nthanks for checking.\n. this is definitely a minor point, it is just feels like a slight code smell to have to change both the return type, and the return value  if you want to change a colour\nso to go from red to blue, you need to go from\nstatic var accent: Color.red.Type {\n        return Color.red.self\n    }\nto\nstatic var accent: Color.blue.Type {\n        return Color.blue.self\n    }\nas opposed to\nstatic var accent: Color {\n        return Color.red.self\n    }\nto\nstatic var accent: Color {\n        return Color.blue.self\n    }\nas I said, not a big deal, but essentially we have the same behaviour in multiple structures, but without it being formalised through inheritance.\nre the second option; It doesn't do the same job as you can't then use\nColor.primary.lighter\n. thank you. My code will smell all the sweeter ;)\n. fwiw - I think subspecs would be neater than using defines.\nthe interface for defines is just ugly in xcode/swift\nby comparison, subspecs would be really easy - and simple to document.\n. I don't have any spare time at the moment. Sorry.\n. would be great if you could have a look at the extension-safe stuff soon. \nThat would let me start using this repo rather than my fork...\n. excellent - thanks. Just a reminder to tweak the wiki installation page - it doesn't seem to be open for me to edit.\n. that works (just tested it)\nalthough you don't need version specifiers on the subspecs.\n. my old build setup (xcode 9 with material 2.6.3) still builds correctly. thanks - I misread other issues and thought swift 4 wasn't supported yet.\nperhaps update the front page to show swift 4? (it currently shows swift 3+). turns out this was not your issue - sorry!. Documentation added. this looks sensible in the case where the snackbar is all the way at the top or bottom - but if snackbarEdgeInsets.top or snackbarEdgeInsets.bottom are non-zero it will add inappropriate padding\nfor example, I'm using the snackbar and offsetting it so that it appears below the navbar\n(see 'loading video' snackbar)\n\n.

    "ariedoelman": "I didn't try the 2.3 branch, since I thought you would come with a separate 3.0 branch. There are language changes, and to prevent an overload of warnings, you might want to get rid of that. So could you try to build a 3.0 version without warnings. Take the beta 3 version, since this had more library code changes, as well as language changes (e.g. 'where' is replaced with ',' in conditions). \n. I'm confused, and still having a hard time believing that a 2.3 Material will work well in my Xcode 8 beta 3 project.\nI use Xcode beta (1, 2, and now 3) since a month now.

So I'm confused when you say you compiled it with cocoa pods. Are you sure it uses the 3.0 compiler? Anyway, apart from lots of library naming changes, there are language changes as well. You cannot apply the 3.0 language changes if it also should work for work 2.3. \nBottomline is like to know if I can take your 2.3 development branch to incorporate in my 3.0 project without having to spend lots and lots of time to get it building properly.

While I am on that subject, might I suggest you use the attribute '@available' in combination with 'renamed: ' for this as well. E.g. '@available(*, unavailable, renamed: \"MyRenamedProtocol\")'. \nThe reason I'm asking is because I use your classes quite often, and find myself in the position that the compiler complains about unknown class- or variable names.

I created pull request #1079 for this.. Two other ways I can think of doing this are:\n1.  Make the new init a designated initializer, and make the old init (that always passes NavigationBar.self to super) a convenience init.\n2.

Hi!\nI had time to test it, but sadly the issue is still there. I created a repo to illustrate:\nhttps://github.com/balazsgerlei/MaterialTextViewTest\nIn this project I added to TextView. I set the detail property of the first one to a single space in Storyboard and didn't set anyting to the second when. When you click the button below the two TextField, I set the detail and detailColor property for both TextFields from code (as I do in my real app when the validation of a form fails). The detail is displayed for the first TextField but not displayed for the second one.\nHope you'll get to find the bug, ask if you need anything else! Thx!\n. Hi! Thx for the fix, I verified and it indeed works now with the latest version. \ud83d\udc4d \n(An yes, what you found was a copy-paste bug in the sample project, the truth is that when I tried it I only used one TextView and only later added another one to demonstrate the original issue more clearly) \ud83d\ude04 \n. Sorry for the quite late response. I tried setting the cornerRadius property before which does not work somehow. Masking the bounds does somewhat work but it does hide the line and the floating label when set. I used the following code:\nlet path = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: textFieldSomething.bounds, byRoundingCorners: [.allCorners], cornerRadii: CGSize(width: 4.0, height: 4.0))\n        let mask = CAShapeLayer()\n        mask.path = path.cgPath\n        textFieldSomething.layer.mask = mask\nHowever since I created this issue I switched to using my own TextField implementation (mainly not because of this problem) so the solution for this is not urgent for me in any way and I do understand that this is kind of an obscure way of using this TextField implementation and does not adhere to any Material Design style. For this reason I understand if it will not be implemented and even I think that it might just add too much overhead for this project.\nStill, awesome library and keep up the good work!. Sorry for the quite late response.\nYes, I tried these properties, but the thing is that I would like to specify a different color for the placeholder label when text is entered and when not. This is because if I use a dark background for the screen and a light background for the TextField itself, netiher a light or a dark color work for the \"placeholderNormalColor\", as the placeholder is inside the TextField when text is not entered and outside the TextField when text is entered.\nSince I created this issue I switched to using my own TextField implementation (mainly not because of this problem) so the solution for this is not urgent for me in any way, but I still think it could be a nice addition to the library. But at this point it is only a suggestion, you may decide if it worth implementing it.\nCheers!. ",

I then went through and cleaned up (or at least attempted) some of the method names/properties to be more C#/.NET aligned. I also tried to break up the objects into their respective associated header files for easy look up.\nAlso, some things to note. Xamarin does not support dynamic libraries (swift) easily; so in order to get this to work, I had to modify the build settings of this to embed the necessary swift dependencies into the .framework itself (\"Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries - YES\").\nI don't think the binding is 100% there yet, I can spend some time trying to get 1:1 parity but this should at least help..

    "reidmain": "@danieldahan I am looking at making the changes on whatever Carthage pulls into the Carthage/Checkouts folder just to see if I can get carthage build --platform ios to succeed and my iOS app to build against Swift 2.3\nOnce I get to that point I'll report back my findings and we can talk about merging any changes I make into a branch.\n. Unfortunately we are no longer planning on migrating to Swift 2.3\nAfter making the quickest possible changes to get Material to work with Swift 2.3 (I don't know if they were all the correct ones since I didn't see any tests and we only use two components from Material) I also had to hack about 8 other dependencies to work with Swift 2.3 because it seems like the majority of people are skipping it.\nCurrently we are looking at waiting 2-3 weeks after the Xcode 8 GM is released and then attempting to migrate to Swift 3 then with the hope that all of our dependencies have been migrated.\n. The development branch is working fine through Carthage as well. Any estimation as to when a formal Swift 3 release will occur?\n. @adamdahan excellent. Thank you very much for giving a timeline. I was planning on delving into our port in about two weeks to hopefully give all of our dependencies time to update.\n. Would you like me to open up an issue for how people who are using Carthage do not have the ability to not include features that would trigger privacy warnings?\nI understand it is a complex problem with manually created framework targets but I just want to get the team's official opinion on how they would like people to handle it.\nAt this point in time I am looking at removing Material as a Carthage dependency and manually copying in files but this obviously doesn't scale and is going to have problems in the future for rewrites (like Swift 4 for example).\n. Done https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/580\n. I did but it wasn't exactly clear to me what it's purpose was. I opened the workspace and tried to run the \"TextField\" scheme and immediately got the build error No such module 'Material' which makes sense because I don't see the Material framework included anywhere. The repo seems to just be example code with no way to include Material as a dependency.\nAh nevermind. Before I posted this I decided to sanity check one more time and see that you need to go into the directory of the scheme you want to build and run pod install for each scheme you want to run.\nOf course pod install is not working and even after running it I still get the error that I can't find the module. I'll dig into this.\n. I have tired opening up both CosmicMind.xcworkspace and TextField.xcworkspace.\nThe former gives the No such module 'Material error even after I have run pod install.\nThe later gives a linker error which then displays ld: framework not found Material when you click into it.\nLooking into the \"Build Phases\" I see Pods_TextField.framework under the \"Link Binary With Libraries\" section so I am actually quite puzzled why this is not working.\n. 1.1.1\nAlso I think this is a Xcode 8.1 issue. I converted the project to the \"recommended settings\" and it suddenly compiled.\n. And like I suspected the TextField seems to be working fine in the sample app.\nThere must be something we are doing differently in our code but it is just so bizarre because TextField worked perfect under Swift 2 and iOS 9.\nCould creating the TextField inside a nib make a difference?\n. Sure but first let me prune out some code and make sure the problem is still occurring with the most basic of setup code. Should take me about 5 minutes.\n. OK I have reduced the code to the absolute bare minimum and am still seeing the issue.\nBasically the scenario is as follows. I have a nib file for a UITableViewCell subclass. We add a label, a button and two text fields to the content view.\nInside the awakeFromNib method we call an extension method we added to TextField:  setFontStyle.\nfunc setFontStyle(_ text: String? = nil,\n                        placeholder: String? = nil,\n                        detail: String? = nil,\n                        accessiblity: String? = nil) {\n    self.text = text\n    font = FontStyle.Subheading1\n    textColor = Colors.Black90\n    self.placeholder = placeholder\n    placeholderNormalColor = Colors.Black60\n    placeholderActiveColor = Colors.Indigo\n    placeholderVerticalOffset = 0\n    dividerColor = Colors.Black30\n    dividerActiveColor = Colors.Indigo\n    dividerActiveHeight = Stylesheet.deviceScaleSize * 2\n    detailLabel.text = detail\n    detailLabel.font = FontStyle.Caption1\n    detailColor = Colors.Red\n    detailLabel.isHidden = true\n    accessibilityLabel = accessiblity\n    if let image = R.image.icon_clear_all_small() {\n        setCustomIconImage(image)\n    }\n}\nand that's it. Other than the fact that the text fields are created inside the nibs (or that they are inside a table view cell) everything looks normal.\nI think I'll go and create a quick view controller that adds text fields to it programmatically and see if I have any better luck.\nOh and I just want to reiterate that I changed nothing about this nib and custom cell class during the Swift 2 to 3 migration other than the changes the migrator made which look benign.\n. So I created a quick view controller, programmatically created a TextField and then called the setFontStyle method on it and stuff was busted again. After a bit of experimentation I think I have founds the issues.\n1) Setting the text property to nil causes the placeholder text to go AWOL. If I don't change the text property on the text field then the placeholder text works fine. If I set it to nil or the empty string then it disappears.\nThis occurs in the sample app as well. Go into the ViewController.swift file and add nameField.text = nil at line 78 and you can reproduce it.\n2) placeholderNormalColor and placeholderActiveColor don't behave like I was expecting them to. I thought the removal of placeholderColor meant that if previously you were changing the placeholderColor when the text field became first responder you should now use placeholderActiveColor instead. But we should just go back placeholderNormalColor and modify it when the text field becomes first responder.\n3) The placeholder label now seems to move to the top of the frame of the TextField. I believe our TextFields are now taller than they actually need to be and so when text is entered the placeholder label now animates higher than it should. In the Swift 3 version of Material did the text field's placeholder get positioned above the entered text?\n. @danieldahan I have no sample app to share. I've just been working with a scrap piece of code like:\n```\nlet viewController = UIViewController()\nviewController.view.backgroundColor = Colors.Black10\nlet textField = TextField(frame: CGRect(x: 25, y: 150, width: 300, height: 100))\ntextField.setFontStyle(nil, placeholder: \"Name\", detail: nil, accessiblity: \"Bah\")\nviewController.view.addSubview(textField)\npresent(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\nand playing with the innards of the setFontStyle method to try to get it to behave like it was in the Swift 2 days.\nSo far I think the only bug is setting nil on the text property seems to cause the placeholder label to disappear which you can see for yourself in the sample app or by adding textField.text = nil to the code above.\nThe other issue which I am not confident is a bug is the fact that the placeholder label is now laid out in a different spot. Did that get changed during the Swift 3 migration?\n. Below are some screenshots and the code used to generate them. You can see when you set the text to nil then the placeholder label disappears. In the Swift 2 days this code would generate the same screenshot.\n```\nlet viewController = UIViewController()\nviewController.view.backgroundColor = Color.lightGray\nlet textField = TextField(frame: CGRect(x: 25, y: 150, width: 300, height: 50))\n//textField.setFontStyle(nil, placeholder: \"Name\", detail: nil, accessiblity: \"Test\")\ntextField.placeholder = \"Name\"\ntextField.backgroundColor = Color.lightGreen.base\ntextField.dividerNormalColor = Color.red\nviewController.view.addSubview(textField)\npresent(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\n```\nlet viewController = UIViewController()\nviewController.view.backgroundColor = Color.lightGray\nlet textField = TextField(frame: CGRect(x: 25, y: 150, width: 300, height: 50))\n//textField.setFontStyle(nil, placeholder: \"Name\", detail: nil, accessiblity: \"Test\")\ntextField.placeholder = \"Name\"\ntextField.backgroundColor = Color.lightGreen.base\ntextField.dividerNormalColor = Color.red\ntextField.text = nil\nviewController.view.addSubview(textField)\npresent(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\n. @danieldahan no problem. I'll update the code for the screenshots above so they don't use the setFontStyle method so they can be easily copy and pasted.\n. @danieldahan don't worry I know our extension on TextField is busted and needs to be updated so I'm not gonna try to salvage it. For me the only real concerns are setting the text property to nil and the position of the placeholder label when text has been entered.\n. So here is an example of how the positioning of the placeholder label changes based on the height of the text field.\n```\nlet viewController = UIViewController()\nviewController.view.backgroundColor = Color.lightGray\nlet textField = TextField(frame: CGRect(x: 25, y: 150, width: 300, height: 50))\ntextField.placeholder = \"Name\"\ntextField.text = \"Reid\"\ntextField.backgroundColor = Color.lightGreen.base\ntextField.dividerNormalColor = Color.red\nviewController.view.addSubview(textField)\npresent(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\n```\nlet viewController = UIViewController()\nviewController.view.backgroundColor = Color.lightGray\nlet textField = TextField(frame: CGRect(x: 25, y: 150, width: 300, height: 100))\ntextField.placeholder = \"Name\"\ntextField.text = \"Reid\"\ntextField.backgroundColor = Color.lightGreen.base\ntextField.dividerNormalColor = Color.red\nviewController.view.addSubview(textField)\npresent(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\nYou can see how the placeholder label in the second screenshot is much higher than the previous\nTo see this in practice in our app I have the two screenshots taken from our failed snapshot tests.\nSwift 2 which is what we want\n\nSwift 3 which is what we are currently seeing\n\nYou can see how the placeholder labels jumped up a bunch but the text is in the same place.\n. Actually @danieldahan could you confirm something for me? I would expect placeholderNormalColor to be the color of the placeholder label when the text field is not the first responder. I would then expect placeholderActiveColor to be the color of the placeholder label when the text field becomes the first responder. Currently it looks like placeholderActiveColor just corresponds to the color of the caret that appears when the text field is first responder.\n. So this screenshot from the samples app indicates a bug then? The \"Name\" text should also be pink?\n\n. I'm now confident that the placement of the placeholder label is also a bug. Say you have a textfield whose top is flush with the bottom of some other view, the placeholder label will now overlap that other view. You'd have to put padding into between the text field and the other view and that padding would need to be a function of the height of the text field which, in my opinion, is not ideal. Your text field should be sized such that it is the right bounds to contain all of it elements that it could be displaying.\n. Much appreciated @danieldahan. Let me know if you need anything tested.\n. @danieldahan totally understand. It's not blocking anything on our end at this moment. We put in some workarounds and the second you have a release out we'll update.\n. @danieldahan I'll update to the development branch and report back after all of our tests have run.\n. Looks good from my end. The placeholder text field shows if nil is set and the placeholder text is coloured properly when in the active state.\n. Oh sorry I noticed one issue. If you become active and type in some text it works fine. The divider line and placeholder text are the active color. But if you move to the inactive state and then back to the active the placeholder text is the current color but the divider line is not.\n. @danieldahan no rush man. We already shipped a release with the workarounds I detailed and tomorrow we should be preparing a release with the 2.3.3 version. Everything is solid.\n. So I updated from 2.3.3 to 2.3.10 and unfortunately the divider line is still having the issue where it doesn't become the active colour when it regains focus. Below are some images showing exactly what I am seeing.\nHere is the screen when it is first presented. You can see the two text fields are in their placeholder state.\n\nThen I focus on the first text field and you can see the divider line is the correct colour.\n\nI select an entry from the picker and everything continues to look good.\n\nI then tab over to the other text field and enter some text into it and everything looks good.\n\nBut when I tab back to the previous text field you can see that the divider line for it no longer becomes the active colour.\n\nI cleaned my project and reset my simulator just to ensure that I was building and using the absolute latest version of Material.\n. Your \"all seems to be working for me\" made me go back and double check and I realized that this table view cell is a unique case. In another scenario (where we are taking in a credit card number) the text fields seem to be working as intended.\nI suspect that in the delegate methods of UITextField we are doing something strange that is confusing the state of TextField. I will delve deeper and report back if I think there is anything TextField is doing but at this point in time it looks to be working as intended. Thank you very much for all your hard work.\n. ",

Hey @danieldahan thanks for response. \nI believe layoutSubviews() should never be called regardless of being called external or internally. \nIt seems there are some progress of changes to the more appropriate way of forcing layout:\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/blob/5e81df5a0c3448b9c811d82e57be02e57abd59f5/Sources/iOS/TextField.swift#L385\nswift\nsetNeedsLayout()\nlayoutIfNeeded(). Seems it might be possible if it were possible to subclass TabBar and perhaps possible to override \nswift\nanimate(to button: UIButton, isTriggeredByUserInteraction: Bool, completion: ((UIButton) -> Void)? = nil)\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/710. Thanks for input guys. \n@danieldahan I'm aware this is possible - however the delegates only get called if isTriggeredByUserInteraction which isn't ideal as I'll have to ensure I set the selected state of my tab bar button whenever I programatically select the tab bar item at an index.. oh it seems contentEdgeInsets is the correct property to use:\nswift\nself.pageController.pageTabBar.contentEdgeInsets.right = 50. +1\nAlso use PageTabBarControllerDelegate in multiple places across my current app. \nAs an example:\n```swift\n// MARK: - PageTabBarControllerDelegate\nfunc pageTabBarController(pageTabBarController: PageTabBarController, didTransitionTo viewController: UIViewController) {\n    for (index, viewController) in pageTabBarController.viewControllers.enumerated() {\n        viewController.pageTabBarItem.isSelected = index == pageTabBarController.selectedIndex\n    }\n    self.updatePaddleColour(selected: pageTabBarController.viewControllers.index(of: viewController)!)\n}\n```\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/710\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/740\n. Seems I can no longer override selected index state. Previously I was doing the following:\n```swift\nopen override func select(at index: Int) {\n    super.select(at: index)\nfor (idx, tabItem) in tabBar.tabItems.enumerated() {\n    tabItem.isSelected = idx == index\n}\n\n}\n```. @danieldahan because it's not possible:\n\nHowever with the introduction of: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/860#issuecomment-336740672 it seems my logic above is no longer necessary. . @danieldahan I think TabItemState is unnecessary - why not just use the UIControlState enum?\nPreviously I would setup colours as follows:\n```swift\noverride func prepare() {\n    super.prepare()\n// Setup tab bar items appearance:\nself.viewControllers.forEach { (vc) in\n    vc.tabItem.titleLabel?.font = UIFont.sparkyFont(.calibri, weight: .bold, size: 14)\n    vc.tabItem.setTitleColor(UIColor.cs_Thunder(),for: .normal)\n    vc.tabItem.setTitleColor(UIColor.cs_Citron(), for: .highlighted)\n    vc.tabItem.setTitleColor(UIColor.cs_Citron(), for: .selected)\n}\n\n}\n```\nHowever, now updateColors() overrides all of this & I don't have support for .highlighted state. . https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/740. Property needs @objc prefix:\nswift\n@objc open var tabItems = [TabItem]() {. Also unable to set attributes:\n\n. @danieldahan cheers daniel. changes has worked. . @danieldahan \n\n. In conjunction with the following code:\n```swift\nextension FittingViewController: TabsControllerDelegate {\nfileprivate func updatePaddleColour(selected index: Int) {\n    if let status = self.testResultViewController?.test?.testStatus {\n        if [TestStatus.failedUnknown.rawValue,\n            TestStatus.failedBattery.rawValue,\n            TestStatus.failedLamp.rawValue,\n            TestStatus.failedControl.rawValue].contains(status) {\n\n            if index == 1 {\n                self.pageController?.tabBar.lineColor = UIColor.cs_Thunderbird()\n            } else {\n                self.pageController?.tabBar.lineColor = UIColor.cs_Citron()\n            }\n        } else {\n            self.pageController?.tabBar.lineColor = UIColor.cs_Citron()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// MARK: - TabsControllerDelegate\n\nfunc tabsController(tabsController: TabsController, didSelect viewController: UIViewController) {\n    let selectedIndex = tabsController.viewControllers.index(of: viewController)!\n    self.updatePaddleColour(selected: selectedIndex)\n}\n\n}\n```. @danieldahan I prefer the previous setup. Perhaps it's worth discussing with @OrkhanAlikhanov as to workarounds?. Interesting. but there must be some transition calls called on the view controller? it should be possible to load a view controllers view without performing it's view lifecycle events.\n@danieldahan . Just had a quick crack at my setup with UIPageViewController and can confirm that calling:\nself.availableViewController.loadViewIfNeeded()\ndid not trigger any of the view lifecycle events until that page actually was about to become visible. \n\n. @danieldahan nah I wouldn't rush into switching to UIPageViewController. sure we can figure a solution. will look into it quick - but afraid I've also got more pressing issues. . @danieldahan the drama is due to TabsController.prepareViewControllers() performing prepareViewController(at: i) which in turn triggers TransitionController.prepare() which performs v.didMove(toParentViewController: self). This is not appropriate for all the view controllers being added to the tab bar controller & should only be called on the visible view controller after transitioning.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621405-didmove. @danieldahan not sure how tabItem has anything to do with what I just described. \nKnock out: prepareViewController(at: i) and the problem this issue is describing goes away.\n```swift\nfunc prepareViewControllers() {\n    for i in 0..<viewControllers.count {\n        guard i != selectedIndex else {\n            continue\n        }\n    viewControllers[i].view.isHidden = true\n    /*\n    prepareViewController(at: i)\n     */\n}\n\nprepareViewController(at: selectedIndex)\nprepareRootViewController()\n\n}\n```. @danieldahan that may well be the case. but it's not the reason for this issue I'm describing. \nTabsController.prepareViewControllers() is triggering the adding of all the tabs view controller views & adding them to the container view - which doesn't take full advantage of dynamically adding the view controllers view's to the container as and when needed. . @danieldahan strange. mine works as I expect & tab items are showing up. @danieldahan this is simply because your demo project tab item titles are setup on viewDidLoad(). \nThere is two solutions around that - either you setup the titles on init rather than relying on the controllers view to be loaded. Or have all your views loaded at the time of prepare view controllers: TabsController.prepareViewControllers() such as:\nswift\nfileprivate extension TabsController {\n    /// Prepares all the view controllers.\n    func prepareViewControllers() {\n        self.viewControllers.forEach { $0.loadViewIfNeeded() }\n        prepareViewController(at: selectedIndex)\n        prepareRootViewController()\n    }\nThe disadvantage of forcing the views to load is this will be much larger impact on memory and processing power if there are lots of view controllers as part of a TabsController. With the changes on my PR - view controller views will only be loaded as and when necessary.\n. @danieldahan well I don't want to introduce any breaking changes. Perhaps I should include the above logic which forces the view load to? - with a comment mentioning why? . If it's decided that it's not appropriate to remove the hidden child view controllers from the stack upon completion of the transition. A similar solution to the appearance transitions by simply avoiding adding the view controller view to the tab bar controller container view until necessary.. Which perhaps is a better solution. To have the tabs view controllers remain in the child view controller stack and the transition add and remove the view controllers dynamically:\nSomething like this:\n```swift\nfunc transition(to viewController: UIViewController, isTriggeredByUserInteraction: Bool, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)?) {\n    guard let fvc = rootViewController else {\n        return\n    }\nlet tvc = viewController\ntvc.beginAppearanceTransition(true, animated: true)\ntvc.willMove(toParentViewController: self)\n// Add destination view to container view\ntvc.view.frame = container.bounds\n\nlet fvcIndex = viewControllers.index(of: fvc)\nlet tvcIndex = viewControllers.index(of: viewController)\n\nvar isAuto = false\n\nswitch tvc.motionModalTransitionType {\ncase .auto:\n    isAuto = true\n    tvc.motionModalTransitionType = fvcIndex! < tvcIndex! ? .slide(direction: .left) : .slide(direction: .right)\ndefault:break\n}\n\nif isTriggeredByUserInteraction {\n    delegate?.tabsController?(tabsController: self, willSelect: tvc)\n}\n\nview.isUserInteractionEnabled = false\nMotion.shared.transition(from: fvc, to: tvc, in: container) { [weak self, tvc = tvc, isAuto = isAuto, completion = completion] (isFinished) in\n    guard let s = self else {\n        return\n    }\n\n    if isAuto {\n        tvc.motionModalTransitionType = .auto\n    }\n\n    s.rootViewController = tvc\n    s.view.isUserInteractionEnabled = true\n    tvc.didMove(toParentViewController: s)\n    tvc.endAppearanceTransition()\n\n    // Remove the fvc view from container view\n\n```. @danieldahan afraid that's not the behaviour I wish to implement. Please observe the animated gif on the op. Notice how the paddle turns red when navigating to \"Test & Status\" this is no longer possible with the new setup. . This actually related to the issue I created here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/issues/915\nWhere by it's not longer possible to have different colour states for each tab bar index. . Yeah that's exactly right - as a compromise we can setup different colours for certain index items. This can also be applied to tab bar title colours.. glad you're on board. there's no rush\nhowever I personally had no drama with setting up title colour & states on a view controllers tab item:\nswift\nvc.tabItem.setTitleColor(UIColor.cs_Citron(), for: .highlighted)\nI suppose now extra effort is having to be made to cater for everyones edge cases\n. @danieldahan I imagine this is either due to having performed a revert PR 5541cb0fbe451a4b2342206c5c8f145fa17c1f82 or some issue during merge with development branch.. @danieldahan please don't ignore this PR. I've tested this & it's now producing the behaviour originally expected in PR: #923\nIf you're not happy with the function name prepareViewController() - which dynamically adds the destination view controller as a child, then we can rename or add a new function.. @danieldahan I can't figure out what your reasoning is? Why did you ignore this PR? \nYou've now removed all calls to appearance transitions & ignored my comments here where by the required line:\nswift\nprepareViewController(at: tvcIndex)\nis missing. @seubseub please can you test this PR as you mentioned you also had the issue where by the child view controllers do not belong to parent. . @danieldahan my advice is add all this logic to your tab view controllers:\n```swift\noverride open func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n    print(\"(self) viewWillAppear - Parent: (self.parent)\")\n}\noverride open func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    print(\"(self) viewDidAppear - Parent: (self.parent)\")\n}\noverride open func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewWillDisappear(animated)\n    print(\"(self) viewWillDisappear - Parent: (self.parent)\")\n}\noverride open func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidDisappear(animated)\n    print(\"(self) viewDidDisappear - Parent: (self.parent)\")\n}\n```. without this PR notice how the view lifecycle calls are performed way too many times & has no parent:\n<TabsController.GreenViewController: 0x7feb16507230> viewWillAppear - Parent: nil\n<TabsController.GreenViewController: 0x7feb16507230> viewDidAppear - Parent: nil\n<TabsController.GreenViewController: 0x7feb16507230> viewWillDisappear - Parent: nil\n<TabsController.CyanViewController: 0x7feb165069d0> viewWillDisappear - Parent: nil\n<TabsController.GreenViewController: 0x7feb16507230> viewWillAppear - Parent: nil\n<TabsController.GreenViewController: 0x7feb16507230> viewDidAppear - Parent: nil\n<TabsController.CyanViewController: 0x7feb165069d0> viewDidDisappear - Parent: nil\nvs. with this PR:\n```\n viewWillDisappear - Parent: Optional()\n viewWillAppear - Parent: nil\n viewDidDisappear - Parent: nil\n viewDidAppear - Parent: Optional()\n``\n. Without thetvc.beginAppearanceTransition()the view controller lifecycleviewWillAppear()gets called upon adding subview to container:container.addSubview(v.view)`\n\nTo overcome this perhaps the container.addSubview(v.view) could be removed from prepare(viewController: UIViewController?, in container: UIView) and leave Motion responsible for performing the appearance transition calls as you've implemented here: https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/commit/b9a2576453296a86582ed43aad357456e76a7924. 43237ca08fcea335e5c211adb4ee2f861d6798b9. @danieldahan or perhaps rather TransitionController should be responsible for adding the child view controller to it's parent & performing the balanced calls to beginAppearanceTransition(). . @danieldahan which is good. but as the screenshot demonstrated container.addSubview(v.view) is triggering viewWillAppear() before appropriate. \nPerhaps consider using:\noverride open var shouldAutomaticallyForwardAppearanceMethods: Bool {\n    return false\n}\nAs this prevents this said behaviour & viewWillAppear() is triggered by Motion\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ImplementingaContainerViewController.html. \u261d\ud83c\udffe yup that last commit combined with latest version of Motion (https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/commit/b9a2576453296a86582ed43aad357456e76a7924) produces the desired behaviour . @danieldahan yeah nice. that's commit is spot on. works exactly as expected. Thanks!\nImportant to note a release update to Motion is required, to include the appearance transition updates ( https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/commit/b9a2576453296a86582ed43aad357456e76a7924 ). Only thing I can spot with those changes is the appearance transitions are not being called on the initial root view controller. \nPerhaps the following needs to take place when setting the initial root view controller (without transition)\nswft\nself.rootViewController.beginAppearanceTransition(true, animated: false)\nself.rootViewController.endAppearanceTransition()\nor perhaps shouldAutomaticallyForwardAppearanceMethods should be toggled prior to transitioning. . This is due to shouldAutomaticallyForwardAppearanceMethods being implemented & not calling the appropriate appearance transition functions on initial setup of root view controller:\nhttps://github.com/CosmicMind/Material/pull/938#issuecomment-339204901. There needs to be a feature where by lifecycle functions are performed when updating root view controller directly.\nswift\nself.rootViewController = UIViewController() // View lifecycle not called\nself.transition(to: UIViewController(), completion: nil) // View lifecycle called. Not a huge fan of it, but passing the transition logic on as follows, resolved it for me:\n```swift\nopen class TransitionController: UIViewController {\nopen override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n    self.rootViewController.beginAppearanceTransition(true, animated: animated)\n}\n\nopen override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    self.rootViewController.endAppearanceTransition()\n}\n\nopen override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewWillDisappear(animated)\n    self.rootViewController.beginAppearanceTransition(false, animated: animated)\n}\n\nopen override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidDisappear(animated)\n    self.rootViewController.endAppearanceTransition()\n}\n\n```. yeah sounds fine. trusting it's toggled at the right occasion .

Hey @danieldahan,\nThink I might have found the issue.

    "timoschwarzer": "You are fast, man! Thanks!\n. I was only stunned by your reply speed!\nKeep up the good work... \ud83d\ude04 \n. @danieldahan You can take the programmatic NavigationDrawerController sample and make the TransitionedViewController extend UITableViewController instead of UIViewController. I tried this and it shows the mentioned effect.. But the toolbar is hidden for exactly the same amount of time like the transition's duration is. So if you call transition(to: duration:) with a duration of 10sec, you won't see the toolbar for 10sec.. Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 . When I comment out (RootController.swift : 129)\nswift\nviewController.view.frame = rootViewController.view.frame\nthe SnackbarController's view doesn't get larger when changing view controllers. But it's still too large.. The issue is, that the rootViewController of my SnackbarController has always the wrong height. And the height gets increased by 138 every time I change the rootViewController using .transition(). I'll make one! :). Okay, this is becoming strange... But maybe you do know what happens here:\nI'm adding an ActivityIndicator as the Toolbar's rightView like this:\n```swift\nlet activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(activityIndicatorStyle: .white)\nlet activityIndicatorContainer = UIView(frame: CGRect())\ntoolbar.rightViews = [activityIndicatorContainer]\nactivityIndicatorContainer.autoresizesSubviews = true\nactivityIndicatorContainer.addSubview(activityIndicator)\nactivityIndicator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\nactivityIndicatorContainer.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(item: self.activityIndicator, attribute: .centerX, relatedBy: .equal, toItem: activityIndicatorContainer, attribute: .centerX, multiplier: 1, constant: 0))\nactivityIndicatorContainer.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(item: self.activityIndicator, attribute: .centerY, relatedBy: .equal, toItem: activityIndicatorContainer, attribute: .centerY, multiplier: 1, constant: 0))\nactivityIndicator.startAnimating()\n```\nWhen I remove that part, we can completely forget that 138 thing, because it doesn't happen without that. (But I really want to know what happens there and how to add a vertical centered ActivityIndicator to a Toolbar)\nBut the view stills seems to be too high. I'm setting a tableView's background view like this (should be v- and h-centered):\n```swift\nlet messageLabel = UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: self.tableView.bounds.size.width, height: self.tableView.bounds.size.height))\nmessageLabel.text = message!\nmessageLabel.textColor = Color.black\nmessageLabel.numberOfLines = 0;\nmessageLabel.textAlignment = .center;\nmessageLabel.font = UIFont(name: \"TrebuchetMS\", size: 15)\nmessageLabel.sizeToFit()\nself.tableView.backgroundView = messageLabel;\nself.tableView.separatorStyle = .none;\n```\nThis is NavigationDrawerController > ToolbarController > SnackbarController > MyTableViewController:\n\nAnd this is NavigationDrawerController > ToolbarController > PageTabbarController > MyTableViewController\n. And here is an example project. See AppDelegate.swift, line 41\nNavigationDrawerController copy.zip\n. Very nice, thank you!. The snackbar is not the problem. The problem is the snackbarController laying out its subviews (see the images above). The first \"Hello\" should be centered, too, but it isn't. It's an UILabel as a TableView's backgroundView. And the TableView is inside a SnackbarController. If I put the TableView into another Controller, let's say a PageTabBarController (image #2), it is centered.. Wow, nice! Thank You! :-)\nI will try this soon.... Yes, it works! Thanks! :-). Okay, I found a way that kinda works:\nself.viewControllers = self.substituteFragments\nself.setViewControllers([self.viewControllers[0]], direction: .forward, animated: false)\nBut I don't know if there is a more elegant way to do this....

I have a similar setup where I have a UITabBarController and I add that as the rootVC of my AppSnackbarController in appDidFinishLaunching. This is all working fine. However, if I navigate to one of my UITabBarController children, and then navigate to a child of that VC via a segue in my Storyboard, my snackbarController property is no longer visible to the child VC. Can you tell me how I make the snackbarController visible to VCs at lower levels in my app?. I will double check when I'm in front of my desktop, but If I recall, I'm calling this long after the viewDidLoad event.\nI take it from your response that I should be able to get a handle to the snackbar controller object on all child navigation controllers of the UITabBarController.

Yes, in UIViewControllerChild.. \nSnackbarTest.zip\nI've uploaded a sample project which demonstrates my setup. You will see that I'm accessing the snackbarController from buttons in the view controllers, so the property should have been initialised.\n.

Please let me know.. Thanks for looking into this for me. The approach you suggest of wrapping the UINavigationController in a SnackbarController I am doing elsewhere in my app when I present the childVC from a parentVC that implements the UIPopoverPresentationDelegate protocol.\nHowever, in general, I'm trying to use the Storyboard where possible. I've attempted your recommended approach in the prepare(for segue: sender), but if I wrap the segue.destination (A UINavigationController) in a new SnackbarController, I get the error:\nTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Application tried to present modally an active controller <SnackbarTest.GreenViewController: 0x7fdc4540a0a0>.'\nI also tried subclassing UINavigationController to create a SnackbarNavigationController. However, this complains too because the snackbarController isn't open, so I get the error:\nOverriding non-open var outside of it's defining module.\nHave I misunderstood your suggestion? Sorry to be a noob pain, I would really like to make use of this feature, but keep hitting brick walls.. You've totally thrown me now! Can you provide an example of how I can wrap the UINavigationController in the segue? \nIn the example project I uploaded, I added the following:\noverride func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {\n        if let navVC = segue.destination as?

Hi @carbonimax, unfortunately, I haven't solved this yet by using Storyboards and segues. I can workaround it by conforming my source VC to UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate and presenting my target VC as a popover. Using this approach, I can make use of UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate function \n\nfunc presentationController(UIPresentationController:  UIModalPresentationStyle) \nand wrap my targetVC in a SnackbarController and make that the rootViewController of a UINavigationController\nSo something like this:\nfunc presentationController(_ controller: UIPresentationController, viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle style: UIModalPresentationStyle) -> UIViewController? {\n        let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: AppSnackbarController(rootViewController: controller.presentedViewController))\nreturn navigationController\n}\nfunc presentationController(UIPresentationController:  UIModalPresentationStyle) \n@danieldahan - I assume @carbonimax is struggling with the same issue I presented in the example project contained in the SnackbarTest.zip attached to this thread.. Hi @carbonimax, you must have given me some inspiration.

I prefer your approach to mine as it keeps the implementation details outside of the view controller. I've modified it to suit my needs, so, thought I would share in case anyone else has a similar requirement:\nclass SnackbarSegue: UIStoryboardSegue {\n    override func perform() {\n        self.source.present(SnackbarController(rootViewController: self.destination as UIViewController), animated: true, completion: nil)\n    }\n}.

    "azizuysal": "It doesn't happen in the sample app. But in my own app (apps actually, happens in more than one app), secure text entry password field freezes when more characters than visible on screen entered. Instead of scrolling the chars horizontally, like the regular textfield does, it freezes. When I pause Xcode debugging and look at frames, I see that it's frozen on line 374 of TextField.swift, at super.layourSubviews() call (screenshot attached). I have two TextFields in a storyboard file, marked up as TextField/Material in IB, and connected to IBOutlets in my controller. I'm using Xcode 8.1, iOS SDK 10, and using AutoLayout. In the code, I add/change a few things, fonts and colors, but that's all. I just upgraded to latest 2.4.0, but same result.\n. Sorry I was busy with work. I did some tests and I can easily reproduce this. Just set font size to anything above 17 and set secure text entry on, and it will happen every single time when you enter more chars than visible and the field tries to scroll horizontally. I tested with both UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 20) and RobotoFont.regular(with: 20) with identical results in a test project. If you cannot reproduce, I can send you the test project.. I sent you a sample project and I've made a few more tests, and here are my observations:\n1. This happens only when adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth is set to true along with secure text entry mode, and font size above 17. And when testing with Xcode 8.2 iOS 10.2, I noticed it doesn't happen anymore, so this may be an iOS bug. Try running the sample project in both iOS 10.1 and 10.2.\n2. In Xcode 8.2, if I set the font size to a big number like 40, and when adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth is false, text does not scroll horizontally at all, and typed chars cannot be seen anymore. Again, as this does not happen in Xcode 8.1/iOS 10.1, this may also be an iOS bug.\n3. Not a bug maybe, but when more text than would fit in textfield is typed, and then focus is shifted elsewhere, three dots (...) is appended to text, which doesn't seem right for username/password fields and looks a bit odd.

    "sovata8": "iOS/Switch.swift (78163a3, latest), lines:\n352 and 359 (sendActions)\n354 and 361 (delegate.switchDidChangeState, which I also think should not be called)\nI am configuring on initialisation but also later on (when I update a Switch in one part of the app, another one needs to update elsewhere).\nI think these should be called iff the state changes as a result of user interaction, but should not be called when the state changes programmatically. This is so that we can update the 'view' without triggering any side-effects. And if we want to trigger those side effects, we can always make the calls programmatically ourselves. This is also consistent with how UIKit's UISwitch works (I just tested it and it works as expected, no valueChanged calls when setting it programmatically). It's also how all other controls work in UIKit as far as I know. Even the documentation states \n\n\"UIKit > UIControlEvents > valueChanged: A touch dragging or otherwise manipulating a control, causing it to emit a series of different values.\"\n\nand even more to the point:\n\nUIKit > UISwitch > setOn(_:animated:)\nDiscussion\nSetting the switch to either position does not result in an action message being sent.. Upon closer look, setSwitchState should sometimes call the valueChanged and delegate methods, but only when called from a UI interaction context (e.g. in the current code: handleTouchUpOutsideOrCanceled, maybe there is more).\n\nI guess a solution would be to overload setSwitchState with a private/internal version that along with the current arguments, takes a Bool for isCausedByUIInteraction. The current public setSwitchState would keep its signature and all it would do is call the new setSwitchState, passing it isCausedByUIInteraction = false. But for example the handleTouchUpOutsideOrCanceled function will call setSwitchState, passing it isCausedByUIInteraction = true. Then this new Bool will determine whether to call the valueChanged and delegate methods.\nOf course this would cause issues for people who are relying on these calls when setting Switch's state, they would have to make the calls themselves.. That's great! \ud83d\udc4d Thanks for the super quick response and for taking this suggestion on board :). Hi, sorry for the late reply, was away from keyboard during the weekend.\nI just tested the dev branch's version of Switch and it all works as expected (and consistent with UIKit's UIControl's behaviours). Nice work!\nI did a search through the source code for more potential cases of the 'non-recommended' UIControl callbacks (that are now fixed or Switch). I found some such cases but I am not sure if I should continue writing under this thread or open a new issue (or perhaps contact you personally in some way?). I also have a suggestion for the implementation of the solution that I see in Switch (to avoid global variables and state). Not sure what's the most appropriate place to discuss these things. Let me know.\n. So, expanding on the new implementation for Switch, here are some other areas where it would be good to implement that new approach:\nI did a search in the Material source code for some other places that are currently potentially triggerring delegates even when changed programatically (i.e. not via a user interaction).\nI found two such places:\n\n\nTabBar.swift\nopen func animate(to button: UIButton, completion: ((UIButton) -> Void)? = nil) {\nalways calls:\ns.delegate?.tabBar?(tabBar: s, didSelect: button)\nbut should probably only call the delegate it when triggered from:\ninternal func handleButton(button: UIButton) {\nand for example should NOT call the delegate when triggered from:\nopen func select(at index: Int, completion: ((UIButton) -> Void)? = nil) {\n\n\nNavigationDrawerController.swift\nopen func openLeftView(velocity: CGFloat = 0) {\nand the related:\nopenRightView, closeLeftView, closeRightView\nalways call:\ndelegate?.navigationDrawerController?(navigationDrawerController: self, ...\nbut should probably only call the delegate it when triggered from:\nfileprivate func handleLeftViewPanGesture(recognizer: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {\nand the related:\nhandleLeftViewTapGesture, handleRightViewPanGesture, handleRightViewTapGesture\n\n\nSo the suggestion would be to replicate the 'fix' that was done for Switch to these other places.. Hi. Sorry for the late reply, holidays etc.\nGlad to hear you're implementing that approach! Good luck and thanks again for creating that amazing project and being so open to discussions and suggestions :). ",

    "jeantimex": "Thank you so much @danieldahan for your prompt reply! I just tried 2.4.5 on iOS 10.2, Xcode 8.2.1 and I can still see the issue.. Thanks @danieldahan! I tried v2.4.6, and I can still reproduce the problem, but here is my workaround in Swift 3, that is call the becomeFirstResponder in viewDidLayoutSubviews.\noverride func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {\n  super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()\n  _ = self.emailField.becomeFirstResponder()\n}\nI guess this might just be related to my application though, my first view controller has a full-screen size video playing in the background, when user taps on the \"Login\" button, the navigation controller pushes the email view controller to the view stack which has the Material component. \nI've tried the following:\nIn viewDidLoad, after the email text field is setup completely, dispatch becomeFirstResponder call to the main thread queue like so:\nDispatchQueue.main.async {\n  _ = self.emailField.becomeFirstResponder()\n}\nThis works great, but somehow the animation looks jerky, so I changed to the 2nd solution, delay the dispatch like so (still in viewDidLoad):\nlet when = DispatchTime.now() + 0.3 // delay 300ms\n  DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: when) {\n  _ = self.emailField.becomeFirstResponder()\n}\nThis time, it works fine when the view controller is pushed in, but when I navigate back and come back to this view again, the keyboard animation looks jerky again, so I have to call resignFirstResponder in viewWillDisappear.\nDoing so will make the keyboard have the slide-in animation and I don't like it, so eventually I decide to simply call becomeFirstResponder in viewDidLayoutSubviews.\nI don't think it's a problem with Material UI component, I guess since the keyboard and the text field need to show the animation in the same thread and thus conflict.\nI love this component, thanks again for your help!!!\n. Actually, the following code will produce a smoother animation with keyboard:\n```\noverride func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n  super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n  DispatchQueue.main.async {\n    _ = self.emailField.becomeFirstResponder()\n  }\n}\noverride func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n  super.viewWillDisappear(animated)\n   _ = self.emailField.resignFirstResponder()\n}\n```\nWorks with multiple view controllers in navigation controller.\nCheers!.

    "muzoman": "I'm seeing this exact same issue in 2.12.16. Is this supposed to be fixed Daniel?. OK, that's great, thank you Daniel.. @danieldahan what timescales do you reckon it might me fixed in then? Just pondering whether to re-engineer my App to not cache all it's view controllers.... @danieldahan that is awsome! :-) Will wait, plenty of other things to do!. Hi @danieldahan,\nManaged to get time to look at this issue yet?\nCheers!\nJim. OK, thanks Daniel!. Hi Daniel,\nI've been doing some digging into this issue and my usage of the library and I've found that I use the NavigationDrawerController sample as the basis of the App. Having looked at that sample again I noticed that there's a button on the LeftViewController that is supposed to trigger a transition to the \"Transitioned\" View Controller. This is done via the toolbarController.transition method. But this doesn't work - the transition method is invoked but the new view controller is not displayed. \nI changed that transition code line to navigationDrawerController.transition and this worked - the correct \"Transitioned\" View Controller was displayed BUT the toolbar was missing. So I'm not sure what's going on - Should the toolbar transition work correctly? Is that a bug? When using NavigationDrawer to transition the toolbar disappears. Any thoughts?. That makes sense Daniel. It would really simplify the creation of more complex UI's :-)\nRegarding the Sample App not transitioning, the problem exhibits it self in the vanilla sample NavigationDrawerController - just run it and select the left view controller then press \"Transition VC\" button and nothing happens.... Hi @danieldahan, have you had time to look at this yet? I see this behaviour in my App too.. These errors might occur if you don't specify the IOS platform that you're targeting in your project podfile. If you're trying to compile one of the sample Apps then make sure the samples podfile first line is uncommented and looks like: \nplatform :ios, '9.0'\nThen run command >pod update\nThen make sure you open up the workspace Xcode file rather than project.\n. Apologies, something strange going on in my podfile. If I just include non version specific pod lines like: pod 'Material' I don't pick up the 2.15.0 but some ancient version, no idea why. Similarly, I had pod 'Motion' in  the next line and it picked up an ancient version. I had to add specific version information to the podfile and everything compiled OK.. can I delete that file then?. These theme changes have completely broken my UI. Is there a way to globally disable use of themes?. From a coding perspective I now have to litter my code with \".isThemingEnabled = false\" on buttons, toolbars etc. Or I've got to subclass everything to set this to false and then change all my code to use the subclasses.\nYou're right - the first thing I've tried to fix that is now broken is the NavigationBar - this was respecting the background color I'd set, but now does not. I set the isThemingEnabled flag as you described above and this has no effect. I've got a slightly complicated App top level structure, perhaps there's some other class where I need to set this flag to off?\n`let homeViewController = HomeViewController()       \n        let navController = AppNavigationController(rootViewController: homeViewController)\n        let sideMenuViewController = SideMenuViewController(rootVCKey: \"HomeViewController\", rootVC: homeViewController)\n        let navigationDrawerController = AppNavigationDrawerController(rootViewController:  navController,\n                                                                       leftViewController:  sideMenuViewController,\n                                                                       rightViewController: nil)\n\n`\nAppNavigationController is my subclass of navigationController where I'm setting the Theming flag to false.\n\nIn the above image the nav bar should be black.. Thanks for that information. I did as you suggested above but this surprisingly didn't restore everything  to  before.  Now  instead of blue my AppBar is white, so some part of the new code is not behaving as it did when isThemingEnabled is false.\nI'll continue to sprinkle my code with flags to try to get theming to be disabled.. > @muzoman did you get any solution. I tried\n\n(navigationController.navigationBar as! NavigationBar).isThemingEnabled = false but it did not work in one view controllers. I have 4 controllers in Tabbar and one of them is showing no change at all. @danieldahan\nI have done Theme.isEnabled = false as well. Some of the controllers blinks(first theme is applied) but one controllers navigation bar stays black.\n\n@MuhammadNayabButt Yes, everything is working as expected for me.. @OrkhanAlikhanov your stack overflow answer was perfect thank you! I spent ages searching Stackoverflow before raising the ticket here! I phrased my problem wrong! Thanks again! . Perhaps your modifications could be incorporated into the Material NavigationController class?. Hi @OrkhanAlikhanov, I closed on purpose - I realised I could simply customise the title label by assigning directly to its properties after the default initialisation.. ",

    "melcug": "In the beginning of first message (on top in current issue) you can see a link to a project where I faced this issue.\nI cannot reopen the issue.. I used the same register command for cell1, cell2 and cell3 and in tableView func with cellForRowAt i get cell instance using dequeueReusableCell, but lblText1 and lblText2 outlets are nil. All happen when I use your TabViewcontroller. \nIf i use just MyTableViewController as initial view contrller, I don't need to register cell1, cell2 or cell3 because is done in Main storyboard and lblText1 and lblText2 outlets are valid.. I don't understand \"in your storyboard project, you need to set the UITableView to TableView\", how to do that.. I get an error if I comment register command:\n\nRegister command overwrites the storyboard and all the outlink associated with it and in this context I get following error:\n\nIn storyboard I set proper cell identifier:\n\nBellow you have a link to test2 project:\ntest2.tar.gz\nNote. In my searches I found that tableView.register command is used just when the cell is programmatically created, but in my project I need too use views already created in storyboard.\nRegards and thanks for your effort,\nGogu.. I still have this issue. \nIn my previous message i posted a link to a sample project (test2), hopefully that you could solve the problem.\nThe problem only occurs when I use PageTabBarController and this force me to use tableView.register func that probably overwrite storyboard settings.\nI am waiting a new version of Material to test again if it's working or not.. I succeeded to implement UITableViewController views as tabs using TabBarController.\nFor that I changed views initialization in AppDelegate func application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions from:\n```\n    var viewControllers = MyTableViewController\nviewControllers.append(MyTableViewController(category: \"test1\"))\nviewControllers.append(MyTableViewController(category: \"test2\"))\n\nlet pageTabBarController = AppPageTabBarController(viewControllers: viewControllers)\nlet toolbarController = AppToolbarController(rootViewController: pageTabBarController)\nlet menuController = AppFABMenuController(rootViewController: toolbarController)\n\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\nwindow!.rootViewController = menuController\nwindow!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n\nto:\n   var table1ViewController: MyTableViewController = {\n        return UIStoryboard.viewController(identifier: \"Table1ViewController\") as!  MyTableViewController\n    }()\n   var table2ViewController: MyTableViewController = {\n        // different initialization\n        return UIStoryboard.init(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"Table2ViewController\") as! MyTableViewController\n    }()\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {\n\nvar viewControllers = [MyTableViewController]()\n\nviewControllers.append(table1ViewController)\nviewControllers.append(table2ViewController)\n\nlet pageTabBarController = AppPageTabBarController(viewControllers: viewControllers)\nlet toolbarController = AppToolbarController(rootViewController: pageTabBarController)\nlet menuController = AppFABMenuController(rootViewController: toolbarController)\n\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: Screen.bounds)\nwindow!.rootViewController = menuController\nwindow!.makeKeyAndVisible()\n\n```\nIn this mode the storyboard configuration is not broken.\nRegards,\nGogu.. Function to change active tabs by horizontally swiping content view is already in production or not yet?. In latest version of Material (v2.9.1) the bug mentioned in first message (both issues) came back (fixed in v2.9.0).\nRegards,\nGogu.. I am using the latest release of Material.\nThe screenshots are taken in Simulator.\nIn first application (blue toolbar) i don't use a NavigationDrawer controller, but in second application I do.\nOn second application, in the output window is shown, when I change the orientation in the Simulator, the following message:\n\nnavigationDrawerController statusBar is hidden: No\n\nprinted by\nfunc navigationDrawerController(navigationDrawerController: NavigationDrawerController, statusBar isHidden: Bool) {\n        print(\"navigationDrawerController statusBar is hidden:\", isHidden ? \"Yes\" : \"No\")\n    }\n. I am using the last release of Material. \nI didn't tried yet to a real device. The video is taken from simulator.\nOn previous version the line remains ... in one piece.. I tested on real device where the animation runs flawless.. It would have been easier to set the properties in storyboard, but I will live with this and I will add additional source code for each control.. I have the same issue in the latest release (2.12.7) and this issue is not present in 2.12.4 release of Material.. I prepared for you a sample project with the same source code(*) before and after pods update:\n\ntest2-2.12.4 with working (visible) navigationdrawer\ntest2-2.12.7 with not working (invisible)  navigationdrawer\n\n(*) In 2.12.7 release TabsController didn't includes anymore motionTransitionType property..

The first one is with depthPreset = .none and the second is with the line commented out.\n\n\n. I see. Although, it's still the case that the default setting for NavigationBar is to show the shadow, and it's not obvious that you need to use depthPreset = .none to disable it.

    "yasirmturk": "i think this is similar to what i seek https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/issues/69. +100. i do this on viewdidload. this fix broke something inside the button and now titleEdgeInsets and imageEdgeInsets are not working properly for Button, IconButton. I am aligning icon and text in horizontal centered position and for that is used this code\n`extension Button {\n    // MARK: - UIButton+Aligment\nfunc alignContentHorizontally(spacing: CGFloat = 4.0) {\n    contentHorizontalAlignment = .left\n    contentVerticalAlignment = .top\n\n    let imageWidth = (currentImage?.width)!\n    let imageLeft = (layer.width - imageWidth) / 2\n    let titleLeft = ((layer.width - (titleLabel?.layer.width)!) / 2) - imageWidth\n    imageEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(spacing, imageLeft, 0, 0)\n    titleEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(24 + (spacing * 2), titleLeft, 0, 0)\n}\n\n}`\nto get this: \n\nIt was working perfect till version 2.12.2 but after updating to version 2.12.3 it became this: \n\n. you can use the code i have posted to reproduce the issue... just make any button with both icon and text and run it with both 2.12.2 and 2.12.3 you will see. okay. Also there is a need of having no selected tab item on a tab bar .. i am using it as bottom bar on card view and first item always show selected\ncan not do bottomBar.selectedTabItem = nil. on further investigation the container.bounds.width is still 0 for Card which sets the width 0 also for the bottom bar and the bottom bar will never layout subviews due to width check here\nguard willLayout else {\n            return\n        }. I have provided layout.horizontally left and right padding now how can i set the width and also actual width of the view is not available in viewdidload. that is the issue here.. i provided horizontally layout but still the width is 0 or default.. i am attaching screenshot from the @CosmicMind/Sample project please see that the layoutSubviews() method of Toolbar is called after viewDidLayoutSubViews() and that actual width of Toolbar or Tabbar whatever we use is NOT available untill viewDidAppear method\n\n. another best example of this issue is the Grid in Samples project which no longer works at all.. to fix it, i tried overriding the layoutSubViews method and forcefully call grid.commit then it works again\noverride func layoutSubviews() {\n        super.layoutSubviews()\n        if grid.views.count > 0 { grid.commit() }\n    }. try https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/tree/master/Projects/Programmatic/Grid it doesnt work. i mean to say the Grid project does not render any output it shows blank. i pulled the day before yesterday, let me pull again. nothing ..just like a regular toolbar with no item selected. I actually needed a toolbar and thats how i am using it but the thing is that Toolbar is just a NavigationBar, its not providing the functionality of a toolbar so No, i cant use a Toolbar as it does not have a scroller.. and i can not set a long list of \"tools\" to it. so suggesting me for having a nullable selectedtabitem was a quick fix as i thought it.. instead of re-implementing the toolbar may be :). change swift version to 4 in build setting for target Material in Pods project. @varijkapil13 PageTabBarController has been long replaced and it was removed in version \"2.8.0\" and before that the project was definitely not in swift 4. @varijkapil13 if u want to compile for swift 4 then download version \"2.10.3\" or above.. for latest master repo in @CosmicMind/Samples, which uses version \"2.12.13\":\n1. download as Zip\n2. run $ ./install_all_pods.sh\n3. open your TabsController.xcworkspace\n4. select Pods project and change swift to 4.0 for \"Material\" and \"Motion\"\n5.

The workaround from @quanguyen works - where you set the titleLabel in viewDidLoad, and can then set it anytime after - but we shouldn't need to do this.

I appear to no longer have the code for the second issue, using a custom view, but the issue was essentially the same. I just made a custom view, centered the label within it usinglayout(label).center()` and passed it like the stack view above.\nIn the view debugger, the label was there, but the custom view / stack view has a zero height.. Since it's auto layout, that should be set automatically, right? Like it\nwould be if it were just a label?\nOn Sun, Jan 21, 2018 at 10:58 AM Daniel Dahan notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nOkay we will investigate this.

Thanks for the support again. When you do that tutorial, maybe some of my further findings can help.\n\nThis was just a mis-step in the example, removing them does not affect the issue at hand.\nI'll come back to this\nI've tested this and it has the same issues as before.\nSorry, I think I miscommunicated the issue. I wish to use multiple views (e.g. multiple labels, or a label and another view) and let the label height determine the height of the content view of the card (e.g. if it has 3 lines, the content view is larger than if it only has one line).\n\nComing back to (2), this seems to be the heart of the issue. A label has an intrinsic content size, and the stack view, even with arranged subviews present, does not. So it needs to be manually given a height.\nJust using a height anchor doesn't seem to do the job stackView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 128.0) doesn't work.\nThis, however, did work: stackView.bounds = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: card.bounds.width, height: label.intrinsicContentSize.height) or more completely:\nswift\nlet stackViewIntrinsicHeight = stackView.arrangedSubviews.reduce(0, { result, view in\n    result + view.intrinsicContentSize.height\n})\nstackView.bounds = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: card.bounds.width, height: stackViewIntrinsicHeight)\nThis would, however, only work with views that have an intrinsic content size, so perhaps an even more complete method would check for height anchors or bounds sizes? In any case, since my use case is to be have a label and a custom view below that, so I'll have to know the height of my custom view somehow as well \u2013\u00a0though I haven't gotten to that part yet.\nHope that helps in writing the tutorial / docs, and thanks for the help..

I will do it and would let you know.. Hi @ashusath @danieldahan I have tried above code it works(I created a separate project). But my problem is bit different.\nOn previous screens I have hidden the navigation controller. When I come to the required viewcontroller I unhide/show the view controller using this command\nself.navigationController?.setNavigationBarHidden(false, animated: true)\nstrangely after unhiding the navigation controller not even backbutton hides properly neither its tint changes.\nlike following two lines of code does not have any effect. I get the back button in only blue colour\nnavigationItem.backButton.isHidden = true\nnavigationItem.backButton.tintColor = UIColor.black\nit seems there is a problem with native navigation controller and material navigation controller although I am using only material navigation controller. @OrkhanAlikhanov yes I can. \nI will make a sample project that will replicate this issue. In the mean time can you tell me is there a way to hide material navigation bar\nI have been following this code to hide/show navigation controller\nself.navigationController?.setNavigationBarHidden(false, animated: true)\nI think the problem is also related to this method. May be some functions are overridden or something else. @OrkhanAlikhanov where should I send the project?. @OrkhanAlikhanov Code emailed with Subject \"Navigation Controller Issues\". @OrkhanAlikhanov any update?. > @karasahinemre The development branch works well, but we haven't released yet, as we need to document more.\nThe \"Theme.isEnabled = false\" do not work well in development branch. So please fix this as well.. @OrkhanAlikhanov It is working Partially. The main problem exists in navigation bars. In some NavBars there is a default theme color(blue). Although I have set \"Theme.isEnabled = false\"  in AppDelegate. @OrkhanAlikhanov How can I get the latest code. I am using cocoapods pod 'Material', '2.16.4'. I cannot see the changes. Although when From the development branch I copy pasted NavigationController.Swift file and used that in sample project and it is working fine now.

    "CHONUMAN": "yes. I subclassed both NavigationController and BottomNavigationController then set them in storyboard. The navigationcontroller could not set the tabbaritem in the prepare() method. Instead i had to override the init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) method to set it.\nAlso a different issue. I did the same without the storyBoard. BottomNavigationController -> NavigationController -> UIViewController. Where BottomNavigation is the initial view set in appdelegate. this time the status bar wont appear. If i click another tab that does not have a NavigationController the status bar appears. If I switch back the NavigationController of the previous viewcontroller hides it again.. I was setting them programatically. But they wont appear if I set the navigation class in the storyboard.\nCan anyone give me proper directions how to proceed if I follow \"BottomNavigation -> NavigationController -> ViewController\" design. I prefer working with story boards. If I subclass them and set them in storyboards I need to know which methods to implement/override so the changes in properties will work. . ok i got it. i have to set the NavigationBar class in the storyboard. Thanks for the help.. delete this one. posted another. this one is by mistake\n. hello @OrkhanAlikhanov. thanks for the help. the tabbar depthpreset and heightpreset won't set from the AppBottomNavigationController subclass. \n```\nclass AppBottomNavigationController: BottomNavigationController {\nopen override func prepare() {\n        super.prepare()\n        prepareTabBar()\n  }\nprivate func prepareTabBar() {\n    tabBar.depthPreset = .none //Does nothing\n    tabBar.dividerColor = Color.grey.lighten2 //Does nothing\n    tabBar.tintColor = UIColor.black //Does nothing\n}\n\n}\n```. Hello, @OrkhanAlikhanov . I need help with another thing. I'm adding child ViewControllers of the BottomNavigationController in the app delegate.\n```\nlet homeVc = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"HomeViewController\") as! HomeViewController\nlet contestVC = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"ContestViewController\") as!

I'm setting the tab bar item in the ContestNavigationViewController. Convenience init() is used in the sample project. I tried to follow it but it's not working.\n\nBut the tabbaritem is there. when i click it it gets loaded but the image offset gets all wierd.\n\nThe code in the ContestNavigationController is like this - \n```\nclass ContestNavigationViewController: NavigationController {\nconvenience init() {\n    self.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n    preparetabBarItem()\n}\n\noverride func prepare() {\n    guard let v = navigationBar as? NavigationBar else {\n        return\n    }\n\n    v.depthPreset = .none\n    v.dividerColor = Color.grey.lighten1\n\n    preparetabBarItem()\n}\n\noverride func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    navigationBar.tintColor = Color.red.accent4\n    tabBarItem.titlePositionAdjustment = UIOffset(horizontal: 0, vertical: -4)\n\n    prepare()\n}\n\noverride var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle { return self.childViewControllers.last?.preferredStatusBarStyle ?? .default }\n\n}\nextension ContestNavigationViewController {\n    fileprivate func preparetabBarItem() {\n        tabBarItem.image = UIImage(named: \"tabHomeIcon\")?.tint(with: Color.grey.base)\n        tabBarItem.title = \"HOME\"\n        tabBarItem.selectedImage = UIImage(named: \"tabHomeSelectedIcon\")?.tint(with: Color.red.accent3)\n    }\n}\n``. This gives an error -ContestNavigationViewController.swift: 12: 7: Fatal error: Use of unimplemented initializer 'init(nibName:bundle:)' for class 'Uthabo.ContestNavigationViewController'`. I have tried to work it like this - \n```\nwindow = UIWindow.init(frame: Screen.bounds)\nlet homeVc = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"HomeViewController\")\nlet drawerControllerVC = AppNavigationDrawerViewController(rootViewController: HomeNavigationController(rootViewController: homeVc), leftViewController: nil, rightViewController: DrawerViewController())\nwindow?.rootViewController = AppTabViewController(viewControllers: [drawerControllerVC, SearchMediaViewController()])\n```\nBut this happens. The black cut off.\n\nAlso the drawer menu comes under the tabbar.\n\n. you're an angel @OrkhanAlikhanov . bless you man. another minor thing. everything is as I want them to be but when the drawer opens the status bar in the back gets disappeared. when i close the drawer it comes back again.. hi. im using NavigationDrawerController.

The background color of the FlatButton has refused to change to a black color but instead remained white. I had to set the tintcolor of each button. I would work with that now. Thanks. ",
