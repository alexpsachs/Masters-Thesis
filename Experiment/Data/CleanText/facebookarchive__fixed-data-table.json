    "pieterv": "Awesome, thanks @Daniel15 !\n. Hmm interesting looks like it has scrolled the header down a little as well.\n. Unfortunately the table doesn't directly have touch support at this point, but stay tuned its coming soon!\n. @fingermark try it now :) We added touch support to the examples via the Zynga scroller.\n. Hey @matthughes this should be working now on the site! Thanks for the report!\n. Awesome!\n. @willywongi FF does seem to give a lower frame rate to Chrome, i will reopen this to see if we can find a way to fix this.\n. @jusio Awesome idea, i had a poke around in atom and like you said it looks like it has some good ideas we might be able to use! I use atom as my editor and have never seen it drop frames.\n. @nbostrom @wlis implemented @jusio's suggestion see #96, this is in the current master if you wanna check it out. We are seeing some pretty good perf wins in Firefox but its not perfect as a row pre-rendering doesn't seem to be working as effectively as in other browsers since Firefox doesn't seem to paint pixels until they are completely visible.\n. Hmm this didn't seem to totally solve the issue, but the code cleanup is awesome.\nThanks for this, ill merge it, push it live and we can see what else we need to do fix this.\n. This is live now :)\n. Tested locally, it works great. Thanks!\n. +1 I had this enabled but had to disable it as it was breaking the diff between client and server rendering since the html string generated from the markdown was getting modified, i will look at this when i get a chance. As for headers, i dont believe we have the option to set these from gh-pages hosting.\n. I have added the minification and file hashing. It took some serous webpack digging to work out that it applies an html minifier which is enable when you add the uglify plugin, this was causing the differences between the node and client React outputs.\nI don't really think loading React from a CDN is worth the complexity it would add for this site so im going to close this issue out for now, we can address it again if this because an issue.\n. This change is now live, the bundle is a lot smaller now.\nThanks for the issue!\n. Awesome! Thanks @jartek\n. Yes this is used for Facebook's internal runtime type checking system which predates Flow (you will notice the React codebase has these tags well), the intention is to upgrade this to Flow at some point. It would be awesome if the community could contribute to this as well!\n. We have started adding some basic flow typed code, when we update code we will make sure it is typed.\n. @songz like @michaelcarter-wf said you will need an es6 Object.assign shim for the code to work. es6-shim will work, or a light weight option like https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign then do Object.assign = require('object-assign'); would also work.\nPlease let us know if you can think of a more descriptive error message that would help you solve this issue faster.\n. Just a note to say with #102 the Object.assign polyfill will no longer be needed :)\n. Hey sorry this is such a pain, #102 will be out soon :P If you want in the mean time you can run the objectAssignTransformer yourself which should fix the issue for you, so grab the objectAssignTransformer.js file from the PR then add \"plugins\": [\"./path/to/my/stuff/objectAssignTransformer.js\"], to your babel config and that should fix it.\n. Hey @cendy172, Update to the new version we just released (0.2.0) and this issue should be fixed, we don't need the polyfill anymore :) Let me know if not.\n. see #11, If you want to run the code from github you need to build the repo first via npm install && npm run build-npm\n. AWESOME! :+1: \n. Awesome! Thanks for this, we should probably also write a little about how the source CSS gets transformed to remove /'s.\n. This is live now :)\n. @ettysekhon Do you have any kinda of touch support on your laptop? I think this might be a configuration issue with the examples rather than a problem with the table itself. Thanks for the report, we will look into this!\n. Im pretty sure this is related to our touch checking code, our internal apps that use the table are working fine with IE11 but i am able to reproduce this issue on the example site. You can also see how no scroll bar is showing up which tells me table scrolling is explicitly being turned off as would happen if it thinks it should be using touch. Sorry this should be easily fixable but i haven't had the time to do it yet, i will get to it pretty soon :)\n. @luisrudge No we are effectively using the version that is on github master along with react master :) But the places where it is used don't currently support touch so we don't have the added touch support wrapper that we have for the FixedDataTable site examples, thats why i'm pretty sure its not a problem in the core table as we would know about it if was :P\n. @mjibson Yes i think this makes sense, we also have onRowMouseDown but not up. You can probably use CSS to get around this for now but there are certainly use cases which warrant having enter and leave.\ncc @wlis, @jbonta any reason why we wouldn't want to add these?\n. I guess we just need to add a link in the README to the dist files. For UMD support we just need to add a flag in the webpack.conf.js.\n. Yes a CDN would be sweet, im not sure how to do that. Im curious is there any advantage over using rawgit.com?\n. I have added UMD support and versioned build files are available via https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases. I will create a specific issue for adding files to the CDN.\n. Awesome! Thanks for this.\n. Hey @onemanstartup, can you please give us a little more info around this issue. Is this happening on the sites examples? or just locally? is this installed via npm or the dist bundle?\nAgree we should add some more info around browser support/environment requirements, feel free to create another issue for this.\n. Hey @onemanstartup @jusio i'm having some trouble reproducing this issue. I created this minimal test case repo based off your example code above (https://github.com/pieterv/fixed-data-table-test), this runs fine for me locally. Could you try checking this out to see if it works for you and maybe tweak it till you can reproduce your error.\nThanks for your help, this seems like a strange error, it would be good to get to the bottom of it :P\n. @onemanstartup hmm adding devtool: \"eval\" to my config still didn't reproduce the issue :S, i'm on chrome 40, any other ideas? I wonder if this is some kinda webpack issue, I can't imagine what we are doing that would cause this.\n. Hey @jusio, thanks for the awesomely detailed bug report, thanks to this after a lot of digging i think i have found the issue!\nSo first to reliability reproduce the bug i found that if you close the dev tools, then refresh the page it would show up as soon as you scrolled the mouse wheel.\nI believe the issue is related to how webpack is packaging the files then evaling them in combination with the \"use strict\" declaration. So the quick fix for this is to remove the \"use strict\" definition from node_modules/fixed-data-table/internals/ReactWheelHandler.js line 40. Removing this code seems to reliable fix the error for me as it allows the function to use the global normalizeWheel var (it seems to be evaling it into global scope).\nThere is two ways to fix this issue, one hacky quick way is for us to remove \"use strict\" from our files, which i would really rather not do. Or the other way is for webpack to wrap the eval string of the modules in a self executing function which it does for most modules that use custom globals like process anyway. @jusio @onemanstartup In the mean time you can make the change locally and maybe we should file an issue on the webpack repo to see if they are able to fix it.\n. By the way @jusio that looks like an awesome chrome plugin, it's awesome to see this project being used outside of Facebook!\n. @jusio Awesome to hear! It's comments like that that make it worth it for us!\nGood idea i will create an issue with webpack.\n. After some poking around on github issues it seems this is a known issue and can be fixed by adding a \"use strict\"; to the top any file that uses ES6 classes (which will remove them from being inserted in each method), i believe ReactWheelHandler is the only module that falls in this category but i will double check.\nRelated issues:\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/417\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flux/issues/45\n. This should be working in the 0.1.1 release, let me know if not.\n. This is intentional, when you don't use attribute expressions the number gets passed through as a string which means we could have weird side effects when doing basic math operations for example 10 + '5' = '105'. When in dev mode you should be getting a nice error about this from the propTypes checks.\n. Hey @gsklee, thanks for the PR! Unfortunately we can't merge this as these markdown files are generated from the source code and would get overwritten on the next update. But this did help me identify a few issues, one is we should able to simplify the propType check for dataKey using propTypes.oneOfType() and after looking into fixing this i also found that we aren't validating the propType for the column components.\n. Thanks again for this, i have made the change to the source and pushed out the new docs to the site: http://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/api-column.html\n. Hey @andrewrota, yes unfortunately this feature does not work as we are overriding the browser native scrolling and reimplementing it, this means we have missed off some of these platform dependent features.\n@wlis is looking into ways we can take advantage of the browsers native scrolling yet maintain (or increase :P) our scroll perf, which should fix this issue and some of the other related issues.\n. Hey @bakesteve, sorry this is an issue with the examples code not so much to do with the core table itself. So the table doesn't have direct built in touch support and we add it in manually using Zynga scroller. The problem is coming from our some what naive logic to determine whether we should use touch support or mouse support. We are looking into ways of making this better support in the table itself, but if you have any suggestions of how to make the logic in the examples better in the mean time that would be awesome!\n. @ofersadgat Awesome!\n. @ofersadgat i have put your change live but it doesn't seem to have worked for me :/\n@bakesteve Can you check if its working for you?\n. Nice!\n. So the thing that makes these type of features possible is the headerRenderer prop on <Column />, this allows you to override the default header implementation with anything that is renderable via React.render(). So for sorting this is how you would render your own elements that have onClick handlers which you then use to know when to sort your data. As for reordering columns you can probably do it the same way but it will be a bit more involved as you will need to listen to drag events then reorder the columns as the drag happens.\nIt would be very nice to have an easy way to do these things out of the box, we already have a nice sortable header component with some good sorting utils that we use in Facebook so we might be able to clean that up and add it to the core. For column reordering we should at least have a nice example that shows how it could work.\n. @RnbWd Yeah exactly just think of it like any other React render method.\nSo you might end up with a headerRenderer function like this to do the sorting:\njavascript\nfunction renderHeader(label, key) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      onClick={handleClick.bind(null, key)}>\n      {label}\n      <MyArrow\n        direction={getCurrentDirection(key)}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n. Awesome, thanks again for doing this! I will merge this in locally so i can add the key before pushing to master.\n. @jardakotesovec yes sorry the table should support this by default and we plan on implementing this soon. We should be able to see when the user gets to the bottom scroll point and stop preventing default at that point.\n. This should be fixed in the latest release :)\n. Yes fixed-data-table works great with react 0.13 (internally Facebook uses react master), but you are right we should update the package to allow npm installing with react@0.13. We should be able to put out a new release pretty soon with this change.\n. @TomClarkson I have released 0.1.2 which updates the package.json to support react 0.13.0 as well as 0.12.x. Sorry i didn't get to this early but i couldn't get the package.json config to allow the beta version as a dependency.\n. Hey @TomClarkson thanks for the awesome bug report! From looking through your code it looks like a webpack related issue, see https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/issues/20#issuecomment-73403088. We should have a fix out for this pretty soon!\n. Should be fixed in v0.1.1, let me know if not.\n. Good catch! I guess we just need to refactor the if statement. Feel free to do a pull request for this :P\n. Hey @jusio sorry about the late reply and thanks for this PR! This change makes a lot of sense, if you can make the suggested comments then i can pull this in :)\n. Nice! That makes it easy :)\nThis looks good to land, ill just sync the change into Facebook, then merge it :)\n. Awesome, just landed this into FB. In the future we should probably do that check in the invariant via propTypes.\n. @wlis was this something you fixed?\n. Hey @jalateras, @ofersadgat was right the rowGetter needs to be a function. Check to see if that fixes it, if not you will need to look into your browserify config, process is a global in node which we use to check the environment type (dev or production), browserify normally defines this for you but maybe you have that turned off, maybe check your browserify detectGlobals config.\nIm going to close this out since its not a bug in the table per se, but let us know if you can't figure it out.\n. @ofersadgat that is correct, you will need to use the row index as the seed for your random number generator. Or just use some like the modulos operator: return colors[index % 3] which will be stable.\n. Closing this out since its not really something we can \"fix\" and is intended behavior :)\n. @jamnanlaw I have a fix ready to sync which fixes the two issues you pointed out :) with this change the table renders from the server great, the problem we then have is that react cannot mount onto the rendered HTML since its renders differently based on the environment :(, this is the main culprit: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/src/vendor_upstream/dom/translateDOMPositionXY.js#L23-L45. We will probably need to change the code to always render with top and left on the first pass then use translate if the browser supports after that.\nSo a long answer but yes we intend to support server rendering :)\n. Sorry no we haven't made any progress here, this just isn't a use case we have needed. The solution described above is still valid and shouldn't be too hard if someone wants to have a go at solving this.\n. I think reloadRowAtIndex fn would make sense given our existing API but what i would rather see is a more react \"like\" declarative API, although I don't have a good idea of what that would look like. If that looks like it will be a big change we may do this in the mean time. Any thoughts on this approach?\n. Good point! This makes a lot of sense, feel free to send a PR for this change or i can do it at some point :)\n. I would say its missing, we are missing a few events like this. If you want you can defined this on a individual cell via a cellRenderer. But we should look to adding these events to Rows.\n. We can probably look at doing this soon, although a pull request for these changes would certainly speed up the process :P\n. Something like this should work (i haven't tested it):\n``` javascript\nfunction handleDoubleClick(index, event) {\n  // handle dbl click\n}\nfunction cellRenderer(content, index) {\n  return (\n    {content}\n  );\n}\n```\nYou might need to move the default cell padding to this inner element to capture all the clicks.\n. @airwin have you tried the new allowCellsRecycling config in v3.0? It was designed to solve the use cases described here by not rendering columns when they leave the viewport.\ncc @wlis \n. With 0.6.0 you have the option to use your own Cell (so you dont need the 3+ divs that come with the current default cell), i'm hoping this will help make over head of the table less. Let us know if this release helps at all.\n. \\0/ Nice...\n. Awesome, thank you @ofersadgat!\n. Hey @nt591, thanks for the PR, sorry its not obvious but these API docs are auto generated from the source code. If you could make the change here: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/src/FixedDataTable.react.js#L237 it wont overwritten the next time we build the docs :)\n. Fixed via #54 :)\n. Looks good!\n. A couple of things, first you need to use gitraw so it gets the right headers for JS, then you will need to polyfill Object.assign which is where it gets a little hard :P \nI was able to get it going with JSBin: http://jsbin.com/zocituvuyi/2/edit\n. You need to define an onChange handler and then set the value, see: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components\n. http://jsbin.com/kuyixo/1/edit?js,output\nThe table wont rerender a cell unless the data for the cell changes, and since we were by passing the cells data input and referencing the state directly in the cellRenderer it didn't know the data had changed and hence didnt know to rerender. \n. You had a typo, you were setting the data for the clicked row back in place of the rows: http://jsbin.com/ribulu/2/edit\nMore correctly cellRenderers will not be called again unless the cells associated data changes.\n. http://jsbin.com/temufa/2/edit\nSo you need to create a new instance of your object data, its the same reason i was slice()ing the array. If you don't do this you will still have referentially equal objects and oldObject === newObject will still equal true. The react update helper might be helpful if you are doing lots of these updates.\n. Yeah, thats the one.\n. @eugene1g :open_mouth: \nWe should definitely add this to the main readme but at this point the browser support looks like this:\n- Chrome\n- Firefox (will be faster/better supported in the coming release)\n- IE9+\n  - IE11 - On Windows 8 touchpad two finger scrolling doesn't work.\n  - IE9 - Support is likely to be deprecated for this browser very soon.\n. @mkawalec nice catch, we should definitely document this :P but like @mfunkie said could you please add the prop type to https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/src/FixedDataTableColumn.react.js then if you run the docs build npm install && \n./build_helpers/buildAPIDocs.sh it will update the markdown file.\n. Hey @dannymk, You will need an ES6 compatible Object.assign polyfill. 'object-assign' is a good one, you can then do Object.assign = Object.assign || require('object-assign'); before you require FixedDataTable which should fix the problem.\n. Hey @matrinox, i have been thinking about this visibleRows style API for a while but i'm not totally convinced it would be needed. What would be the advantage to using this visibleRows callback over just batching up all data request within a single event loop and then breaking that into request batches? (other than the frame work providing the logic for you :P)\nHere is an example of how i would build the batching logic: http://jsbin.com/temufa/9/edit?js,output\nYou will notice it will also request data outside of the view based on where it thinks you will scroll to, because we are using the rowGetter we can take advantage of the row prerendering triggering requesting data.\n. Agree with @hedgerwang  but this does seem initially non obvious. I think this would be a good example we could add to the site. Im going to close this out and create a task for it.\n. @bizmurr sure i have added it to the list and created a jsbin example, its pretty similar to the sorting example.\n. @gsklee This is pretty weird, looks like it might be a lower level react problem, as from the screenshot it is rendering the correct value just the DOM is not being updated. Do you mind having a try at creating a simple repo case so i can dig into it? here is a good jsbin to start from: http://jsbin.com/valoco/5/edit?html,js,output.\n. Hey @dannymk, the fixed data table applies a very aggressive shouldComponentUpdate function, which stops the cellRenderer from being called unless some data associated with that renderer has changed. The way we figure our what data is needed to render a row is via the rowGetter, so the issue above is that the state you are expecting to update your cellRenderer is not returned from the rowGetter so the diff does know that something has changed.\nHere is an example of how it could work by embedding the data within the row object:\nhttp://jsbin.com/temufa/18/edit\nThe other way to provide this behavior is for the cellRenderer to just return a single react container which is responsible for subscribing to store data changes and updating the cell via setState. We do this for a lot of our applications but this only makes sense if for larger tables with a lot of different possible data types.\nWe are thinking about removing this aggressive shouldComponentUpdate functionality to make the table render more predictability but it will have a large performance cost if all cells rerender with each set update, so we are still trying to find the right balance here :)\n. @rovolution I created this example yesterday which shows how you can implement sorting which should help http://jsbin.com/temufa/10/edit?html,js,output\nAfter not seeing to much detail my guess as to your problem is that the data your updating via setState is not being returned from the headerDataGetter and so the headerRenderer doesn't see the data has changed and doesn't update.\n. Yes it was just simpler that way for this example but you can also pass more complex data via headerDataGetter, just remember if you want the cell to render the data returned needs to change :)\n. Im not sure i understand this change, could you give some more detailed information on what the current behavior is on render and what this effect this change will have?\n. @marcneuwirth Nice, yes this makes sense! Thanks for the detailed explanation. This should also be fixed when we move to the React.cloneElement API instead of cloneWithProps but this is a good interim solution.\n. @ondrejhlavacek thanks for bring this up. This is an interesting side effect of the way we are pooling react components and reusing them as the user scrolls. Maybe we can force them to unmount which might fix this, but we want to be careful we don't loss the ability to reuse the underlying DOM node.\n. Hey @gaearon, Thanks for this. We build the docs via react-docgen so i had to manually add the changes back to the source and merge, see https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/commit/45d64c0f5bda94548d05df5da825e4d124be0e7f\nThanks!\n. I have deleted the generated markdown files from the repo so it should be clearer for other in the future :)\n. Hey @gsklee Thanks for the issue, this sounds pretty easy to fix, we should just force intergers when the value comes in :P\n. Thanks for the PR! i have manually merged this here: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/commit/5a55671722b12accc4ff1d63d0c2089b9192a99a\n. Sounds like this is a dependency issue, feel free to reopen if your still having trouble with the new version after reinstalling.\n. @gsklee @benshimmin Sorry we know this is bad and are planing on fixing this for the next release. For now a hacky fix for this if you know you don't need any scrolling is to set overflowX=\"hidden\" overflowY=\"hidden\" http://jsbin.com/valoco/12/edit.\n. This should be fixed in the latest release :)\n. I will take this after this release so we don't break React 0.12 support\n. This should help with #5 :)\n. Hey @gsklee, thanks for the PR. Yeah this behavior is a little weird. So we have both maxHeight and height so our plan is to change height to make it work like you suggested (always stuck to the bottom) and then make sure maxHeight maintains the current behavior :)\n. They @gabelevi thanks for the PR we fixed this in 0.2.0 by allowing maxHeight or height which have the two different behaviors :)\n. @JedWatson Im using your babel-plugin-object-assign project here :) Unfortunately i couldn't use the project as a dependency as it was giving me an error about using two different instances of Babel, i think your project might need to use peerDeps to solve this but not sure. Anyway thanks for creating this!\n. @ifrit :) I have merged it in, we are aiming to do the release next week.\n. Hey @cesarandreu, @ifrit, @zackify sorry for the delay but we have now done the v0.2.0 release, with this code in it! Check it out, and please let us know if something doesnt work for you :)\n. @hipertracker I will build the dist files when we release. As for the React i had it that way was the browser global for react is window.React not lowercase but ill look for a way to support both. Thanks for the feedback!\n. @hipertracker after some sleuthing around other webpack configs i think have the solution now. If you could try the new changes that would be very helpful :)\n. Nice! Thanks for testing.\n. Hey @hipertracker i assume you got this going, the repo seems to be working fine for me. Pretty sweet demo as well!\n\n. @TomClarkson Sure that should be doable\n. This release is out! https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases/tag/v0.2.0\n. Not at the moment, rendering a row is currently very complex especially with fixed columns and it would be hard to allow a user to do this and still render correctly. This something we will think about when refactoring the core to be more flexible in the future but its not on the immediate road map.\n. Hey @difelice, thanks for the PR. I think this usecase is already covered by the user being able to determine if a column should be rendered at all:\n<Table>\n  <Column />\n  {hidden ? null : <Column />}\n</Table>\n. For this use case you can use the headerDataGetter on the Table component  to return the relevant data into the headerRenderer :)\n. I fixed this with #110, if you pull down master and then do a fresh npm install it should work :)\n. Hey @Andreyco, PR would be awesome! This is definitely something we want, we just haven't had the time to do it.\nSo the way we have thought about approaching this is to split out layout specific css and styling \"theme\" css. The layout styles should include anything that is required to make the table function/ position correctly (like you described). With the \"theme\" being everything else including borders and such. Ideally we would split the current stylesheets in two different css files for each one and create different classes for both the styling hooks and the layout. In the long term we see the layout styles being included as inline CSS in the react component but we don't think our tooling this ready for this yet, with this in mind it makes splitting the class names out more important so its easier to remove and pull the style inline in the future :)\nLet me know of you have any questions or need any help.\ncc @jbonta Do you have any other thoughts on this?\n. Hey @jmcpeak, hmm i think the order of requires is wrong in that fiddle which is throwing it off. I tired getting the project working in jsfiddle a while back but i couldn't get it easily setup due to the need for the object.assign polyfill before defining the table, but this should be easier in the next version of the table where this is not needed. I did setup the project with jsbin which has been working well for me: http://jsbin.com/valoco/10/edit?html,js,output\n. Hey @allanbond shouldn't it be enough to install via bower install facebook/fixed-data-table and reference the dist files? What advantage does having the bower.json file give? Bower can look at git tags right?\n. Hey @DanielMiddleton the table handles most of this logic for you and will call the rowGetter function as the rows get close to being in view, the one key thing is you will need to give it an absolute number of rows so the scollbar size can be estimated but you can update the value over time as you get more data. Here is an example of how this can be implemented http://jsbin.com/temufa/8/edit?html,js,output)\n. Hey @Andreyco, Sorry for the slow response. This PR looks really good! Ill get @jbonta to give it a full review soon. Also I can take a look at the build step stuff if you wanna remove it from this PR.\nThanks for putting this together!\n. @jbonta how do you feel about having all the theme styles in a single file? Is it worth splitting them out?\n. No we don't have our own chat room but i do hang out in the #reactjs IRC chat room if you want to ping me there :)\n. Nice find! Would love a PR for this :)\n. Awesome, thanks for the PR @llh1, if you can do the change @hedgerwang suggested then i can merge this in :)\n. Awesome, thank you @llh1!\n. Thanks for bring this up this will be super useful for when taking on accessibility.\ncc @jbonta \n. So we have unit tests setup for this code in the FB code base which we run when we sync code changes back in to FB we just haven't had the time to pull them out and setup the infra in this repo. I agree this is pretty bad though :(, ill try setting this up before the next release.\n. Hmm interesting its working for me on Chrome and Firefox on Mac, it looks like Zynga scroller is failing for you. Do you mind checking to see if your getting any failed network requests?\n. Hmmm thats interesting i will have to take a deeper look, thanks for the detailed info!\n. Hmm looks like this is a CDN issue, i will see if i can find a more reliable place to host this file.\n. Yeah you will just want to setup a custom cellRenderer on the column which you can then render what ever you want with react :)\n. @ConAntonakos I think in the latest React you would write it like this if your not using JSX:\nfunction renderLink(cellData){\n  return React.createElement('div', { dangerouslySetInnerHTML: {__html: cellData} });\n}\nDoes that work?\n. Hey sorry @iammerrick i'm probably too late to help you but there was nothing inherently wrong with what you had i don't see any reason it shouldn't work. \nI ran the following code and it worked fine for me, maybe try with the latest release?\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nvar FixedDataTable = require('fixed-data-table');\nrequire('fixed-data-table/dist/fixed-data-table.css');\nfunction DataTableHandler() {\n  return class DataTableHandler extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n  var Table = FixedDataTable.Table;\n  var Column = FixedDataTable.Column;\n\n  // Table data as a list of array.\n  var rows = [\n    ['a1', 'b1', 'c1'],\n    ['a2', 'b3', 'c2'],\n    ['a3', 'b3', 'c3']\n  ];\n\n  function rowGetter(rowIndex) {\n    return rows[rowIndex];\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <Table\n      rowHeight={50}\n      rowGetter={rowGetter}\n      rowsCount={rows.length}\n      width={5000}\n      height={5000}\n      headerHeight={50}>\n      <Column\n        label=\"Col 1\"\n        width={3000}\n        dataKey={0}\n      />\n      <Column\n        label=\"Col 2\"\n        width={2000}\n        dataKey={1}\n      />\n    </Table>\n  );\n}\n\n}\n}\nexport default DataTableHandler();\n```\n. Hey @mikestead Thanks for the PR!\n@jbonta @wlis What do you think about changing the scroll bar to not overlap the header?\n. This should work now with the latest releases dist build, you will need to make sure you install and require React before the table.\n. Exciting! I feel a release coming :P\n. Nice, thanks for the quick PR, hmmm would prefer to use Math.round so its a bit clearer whats happening + round will go to the closest value not just strip the decimal :)\ncc @wlis Do you think we should do it here or on the resulting value so we don't need to round every prop?\n. Hey @cesarandreu thanks for bringing this up! I have put this info into the github release :) https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases/tag/v0.2.0 And we will continue to do this for all future releases.\n. With the \"Replacing getDOMNode with findDOMNode\" commit we will be breaking compatibility with react 0.12.x this seems fine to me but we should make this clear in the release notes and update the package.json.\n. This looks good to go, merge when ready.\n. Awesome! Looks good to me. Release when ready :)\n. Awesome! once you have cleaned up the minor lint issues and squashed the changes into one commit you can merge when your ready :)\n. Awesome!\n. cc @jbonta \n. This looks good to me. Merge when ready :)\n. So much red :heart::heart::heart: this is looking really good! Lets get this in.\n. FixedDataTable will definitely work with the beta since FB runs React master internally. But last time i tried to do this i couldn't get the npm dependencies to allow a beta as well as the normal versions. If anyones has an idea how the npm dependency versioning should look for this i will be happy to do the release.\n. @cesarandreu thanks for the info! Let us know if the release doesn't solve the problem for you.\n. @bolinfest i'm not happy with the approach taken here, as a library special casing one particular consumers use case like isn't a maintainable solution for us given all the consumers we have and their needs. Its great we could unblock you for this but lets work together to find a way to alias the react module at your build level (babel has a way to do this) as we wont be able to maintain this special case long term and i would guess not all libraries are going to be so accommodating.\n. I would recommend for this using a transparent border, this way you keep the width but it looks like its not there. Our default layout theme does this. In the future we are looking to make this stuff configurable via inline styles but its currently assumed in a lot of places\n. The other thing you can do is in each cell on componentDidMount you check the contents height via React.getDOMNode().outerHeight (or something like that) then use that to reset the height of the row. The downside is this will be pretty hard to get to run a performant way. The auto content sizing is not something we are looking at adding to this library.\n. Hey @fullvlad yes this is possible, at FB we have this functionality with FixedDataTable for one of our ads products. For something complex like this I would suggest connecting each cell to its data source directly, we do this via Flux, each cell connects to its data store based on the row index and binds to events which will set state on the cell (rather than passing the data back through the data getter).\n. Check out the 0.6.0 release with this there are no limitations on what can be passed to a cell since we don't own any of this state.\n. @vojtech-dobes I though this was the case (that rowHeightGetter would only be called for visible rows), @wlis any thoughts here?\n. Thanks @masonicboom i have fixed this with fb7b6f4494af0c3c7a20c55e7d11271b1ebb9777\n. I have done a quick release with @chentsulin's PR to allow react@0.14.0-rc1 as a dep (https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases/tag/v0.4.7) and will try to do another release shortly to clean up the warnings.\n. Sorry there is no standard way in the FixedDataTable to do this, in theory you should be able to build this in your cell by measuring all the column content after render then set the width. This is not an API we expect to add to the table since it would be very hard to do it a performant way.\n. Yeah you likely are missing a bind somewhere.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome thanks for this @chentsulin!\n. I have pushed out the 0.5.0-rc1 package which adds support for React 0.14.0, if someone can try it out and make sure its working for you i can publish the stable 0.5.0 release.\n. Thanks @musbaig! i have now published 0.5.0\n. Awesome, glad to hear this. Let us know if you run into problems with this!\n. You will need to listen to the window resize event and then update the table with when it changes, here is how we do it for the examples page: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/cf28c0e78a3859c9a6e5d94fc84912e28d64f62a/site/examples/ExamplesPage.js#L100-L116\n. Hey @johnnyji check out the latest 0.6.0-rc1 release (docs are here for now). With this, the fixed data table no longer needs any data via the rowGetter so you can use whatever data structure you want :)\n. Sorry its not possible with the current release. If you check out the latest 0.6.0-rc1 release (docs are here for now). With this, the fixed data table no longer needs any data via the rowGetter so you can access data however you want :)\n. cc @ehzhang @wlis\n. No worries :) I simplified the examples a bunch to :)\nWill be great to finally release your awesome work!\n. :dancers::dancers::dancers: \n. This code has been released as v0.6.0-rc1! Im working on docs now for the full release.\n. Sorry we are halfway through a release, the example in the readme is for the 0.6.0 release which is only released as 0.6.0-rc1. You are welcome to try this out (it will be release properly very shortly) or the docs for the current release are on the site.\n. Hey @marduke182, thanks for the PR. The way i was thinking about in the past to solve this was to have some state that tells us we are in the first pass and always render positions with left and top (since we know all browsers support this but not translate pos), then on any other render from there we can use the fancy translate3d stuff. See the inline message for why i think the current approach in this PR is bad. Do you think you would be able to update this to do that?\n. Hmm i dont think this flag necessarily needs to live on state, since we don't actually want to force a render as a result of changing it, we just need a flag to signify that we are now out of the first render. The down side of this is it will make the render more non-pure, but it wont be to much worse than it already was (since it already relies on global state).\nso:\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  this._initialRender = false;\n}\nLets also create a wrapper around translateDOMPositionXY module that does this logic (translateDOMPositionXY is hard for us to change since its a core FB module), so if is this._initialRender then use left and top then after this we just delegate to translateDOMPositionXY.\nThanks for taking this on!\n. Thank you for this!\n. Oh thanks for the issue, i think i know what i might have missed when messing with the examples for the  latest release.\n. cc @wlis @jbonta @dehamilton\n. Oh yeah we should fix this up, so whats happening here is this is where we reach the maximum size of a div that the browser supports, so it just stops rendering after that height, we should change all the examples to instead of rendering 1,000,000 rows we render 500,000 or something. If you have time to submit a PR this is the the number you need to change for each example: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/examples/ResizeExample.js#L32\n. oh wow :( thanks for this!\n. Oh nice! Would love a PR for that.\n. Thanks for working on this @zpao. The synced code looks good, it contained everything I expected. The build system is looks nice although i didn't look into it with a huge amount of detail. Let me know if you want me to do another review or help out with testing.\n. let me know if i broke anything :D. Awesome, thanks @Daniel15 !\n. Hmm interesting looks like it has scrolled the header down a little as well.\n. Unfortunately the table doesn't directly have touch support at this point, but stay tuned its coming soon!\n. @fingermark try it now :) We added touch support to the examples via the Zynga scroller.\n. Hey @matthughes this should be working now on the site! Thanks for the report!\n. Awesome!\n. @willywongi FF does seem to give a lower frame rate to Chrome, i will reopen this to see if we can find a way to fix this.\n. @jusio Awesome idea, i had a poke around in atom and like you said it looks like it has some good ideas we might be able to use! I use atom as my editor and have never seen it drop frames.\n. @nbostrom @wlis implemented @jusio's suggestion see #96, this is in the current master if you wanna check it out. We are seeing some pretty good perf wins in Firefox but its not perfect as a row pre-rendering doesn't seem to be working as effectively as in other browsers since Firefox doesn't seem to paint pixels until they are completely visible.\n. Hmm this didn't seem to totally solve the issue, but the code cleanup is awesome.\nThanks for this, ill merge it, push it live and we can see what else we need to do fix this.\n. This is live now :)\n. Tested locally, it works great. Thanks!\n. +1 I had this enabled but had to disable it as it was breaking the diff between client and server rendering since the html string generated from the markdown was getting modified, i will look at this when i get a chance. As for headers, i dont believe we have the option to set these from gh-pages hosting.\n. I have added the minification and file hashing. It took some serous webpack digging to work out that it applies an html minifier which is enable when you add the uglify plugin, this was causing the differences between the node and client React outputs.\nI don't really think loading React from a CDN is worth the complexity it would add for this site so im going to close this issue out for now, we can address it again if this because an issue.\n. This change is now live, the bundle is a lot smaller now.\nThanks for the issue!\n. Awesome! Thanks @jartek\n. Yes this is used for Facebook's internal runtime type checking system which predates Flow (you will notice the React codebase has these tags well), the intention is to upgrade this to Flow at some point. It would be awesome if the community could contribute to this as well!\n. We have started adding some basic flow typed code, when we update code we will make sure it is typed.\n. @songz like @michaelcarter-wf said you will need an es6 Object.assign shim for the code to work. es6-shim will work, or a light weight option like https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign then do Object.assign = require('object-assign'); would also work.\nPlease let us know if you can think of a more descriptive error message that would help you solve this issue faster.\n. Just a note to say with #102 the Object.assign polyfill will no longer be needed :)\n. Hey sorry this is such a pain, #102 will be out soon :P If you want in the mean time you can run the objectAssignTransformer yourself which should fix the issue for you, so grab the objectAssignTransformer.js file from the PR then add \"plugins\": [\"./path/to/my/stuff/objectAssignTransformer.js\"], to your babel config and that should fix it.\n. Hey @cendy172, Update to the new version we just released (0.2.0) and this issue should be fixed, we don't need the polyfill anymore :) Let me know if not.\n. see #11, If you want to run the code from github you need to build the repo first via npm install && npm run build-npm\n. AWESOME! :+1: \n. Awesome! Thanks for this, we should probably also write a little about how the source CSS gets transformed to remove /'s.\n. This is live now :)\n. @ettysekhon Do you have any kinda of touch support on your laptop? I think this might be a configuration issue with the examples rather than a problem with the table itself. Thanks for the report, we will look into this!\n. Im pretty sure this is related to our touch checking code, our internal apps that use the table are working fine with IE11 but i am able to reproduce this issue on the example site. You can also see how no scroll bar is showing up which tells me table scrolling is explicitly being turned off as would happen if it thinks it should be using touch. Sorry this should be easily fixable but i haven't had the time to do it yet, i will get to it pretty soon :)\n. @luisrudge No we are effectively using the version that is on github master along with react master :) But the places where it is used don't currently support touch so we don't have the added touch support wrapper that we have for the FixedDataTable site examples, thats why i'm pretty sure its not a problem in the core table as we would know about it if was :P\n. @mjibson Yes i think this makes sense, we also have onRowMouseDown but not up. You can probably use CSS to get around this for now but there are certainly use cases which warrant having enter and leave.\ncc @wlis, @jbonta any reason why we wouldn't want to add these?\n. I guess we just need to add a link in the README to the dist files. For UMD support we just need to add a flag in the webpack.conf.js.\n. Yes a CDN would be sweet, im not sure how to do that. Im curious is there any advantage over using rawgit.com?\n. I have added UMD support and versioned build files are available via https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases. I will create a specific issue for adding files to the CDN.\n. Awesome! Thanks for this.\n. Hey @onemanstartup, can you please give us a little more info around this issue. Is this happening on the sites examples? or just locally? is this installed via npm or the dist bundle?\nAgree we should add some more info around browser support/environment requirements, feel free to create another issue for this.\n. Hey @onemanstartup @jusio i'm having some trouble reproducing this issue. I created this minimal test case repo based off your example code above (https://github.com/pieterv/fixed-data-table-test), this runs fine for me locally. Could you try checking this out to see if it works for you and maybe tweak it till you can reproduce your error.\nThanks for your help, this seems like a strange error, it would be good to get to the bottom of it :P\n. @onemanstartup hmm adding devtool: \"eval\" to my config still didn't reproduce the issue :S, i'm on chrome 40, any other ideas? I wonder if this is some kinda webpack issue, I can't imagine what we are doing that would cause this.\n. Hey @jusio, thanks for the awesomely detailed bug report, thanks to this after a lot of digging i think i have found the issue!\nSo first to reliability reproduce the bug i found that if you close the dev tools, then refresh the page it would show up as soon as you scrolled the mouse wheel.\nI believe the issue is related to how webpack is packaging the files then evaling them in combination with the \"use strict\" declaration. So the quick fix for this is to remove the \"use strict\" definition from node_modules/fixed-data-table/internals/ReactWheelHandler.js line 40. Removing this code seems to reliable fix the error for me as it allows the function to use the global normalizeWheel var (it seems to be evaling it into global scope).\nThere is two ways to fix this issue, one hacky quick way is for us to remove \"use strict\" from our files, which i would really rather not do. Or the other way is for webpack to wrap the eval string of the modules in a self executing function which it does for most modules that use custom globals like process anyway. @jusio @onemanstartup In the mean time you can make the change locally and maybe we should file an issue on the webpack repo to see if they are able to fix it.\n. By the way @jusio that looks like an awesome chrome plugin, it's awesome to see this project being used outside of Facebook!\n. @jusio Awesome to hear! It's comments like that that make it worth it for us!\nGood idea i will create an issue with webpack.\n. After some poking around on github issues it seems this is a known issue and can be fixed by adding a \"use strict\"; to the top any file that uses ES6 classes (which will remove them from being inserted in each method), i believe ReactWheelHandler is the only module that falls in this category but i will double check.\nRelated issues:\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/417\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flux/issues/45\n. This should be working in the 0.1.1 release, let me know if not.\n. This is intentional, when you don't use attribute expressions the number gets passed through as a string which means we could have weird side effects when doing basic math operations for example 10 + '5' = '105'. When in dev mode you should be getting a nice error about this from the propTypes checks.\n. Hey @gsklee, thanks for the PR! Unfortunately we can't merge this as these markdown files are generated from the source code and would get overwritten on the next update. But this did help me identify a few issues, one is we should able to simplify the propType check for dataKey using propTypes.oneOfType() and after looking into fixing this i also found that we aren't validating the propType for the column components.\n. Thanks again for this, i have made the change to the source and pushed out the new docs to the site: http://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/api-column.html\n. Hey @andrewrota, yes unfortunately this feature does not work as we are overriding the browser native scrolling and reimplementing it, this means we have missed off some of these platform dependent features.\n@wlis is looking into ways we can take advantage of the browsers native scrolling yet maintain (or increase :P) our scroll perf, which should fix this issue and some of the other related issues.\n. Hey @bakesteve, sorry this is an issue with the examples code not so much to do with the core table itself. So the table doesn't have direct built in touch support and we add it in manually using Zynga scroller. The problem is coming from our some what naive logic to determine whether we should use touch support or mouse support. We are looking into ways of making this better support in the table itself, but if you have any suggestions of how to make the logic in the examples better in the mean time that would be awesome!\n. @ofersadgat Awesome!\n. @ofersadgat i have put your change live but it doesn't seem to have worked for me :/\n@bakesteve Can you check if its working for you?\n. Nice!\n. So the thing that makes these type of features possible is the headerRenderer prop on <Column />, this allows you to override the default header implementation with anything that is renderable via React.render(). So for sorting this is how you would render your own elements that have onClick handlers which you then use to know when to sort your data. As for reordering columns you can probably do it the same way but it will be a bit more involved as you will need to listen to drag events then reorder the columns as the drag happens.\nIt would be very nice to have an easy way to do these things out of the box, we already have a nice sortable header component with some good sorting utils that we use in Facebook so we might be able to clean that up and add it to the core. For column reordering we should at least have a nice example that shows how it could work.\n. @RnbWd Yeah exactly just think of it like any other React render method.\nSo you might end up with a headerRenderer function like this to do the sorting:\njavascript\nfunction renderHeader(label, key) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      onClick={handleClick.bind(null, key)}>\n      {label}\n      <MyArrow\n        direction={getCurrentDirection(key)}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n. Awesome, thanks again for doing this! I will merge this in locally so i can add the key before pushing to master.\n. @jardakotesovec yes sorry the table should support this by default and we plan on implementing this soon. We should be able to see when the user gets to the bottom scroll point and stop preventing default at that point.\n. This should be fixed in the latest release :)\n. Yes fixed-data-table works great with react 0.13 (internally Facebook uses react master), but you are right we should update the package to allow npm installing with react@0.13. We should be able to put out a new release pretty soon with this change.\n. @TomClarkson I have released 0.1.2 which updates the package.json to support react 0.13.0 as well as 0.12.x. Sorry i didn't get to this early but i couldn't get the package.json config to allow the beta version as a dependency.\n. Hey @TomClarkson thanks for the awesome bug report! From looking through your code it looks like a webpack related issue, see https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/issues/20#issuecomment-73403088. We should have a fix out for this pretty soon!\n. Should be fixed in v0.1.1, let me know if not.\n. Good catch! I guess we just need to refactor the if statement. Feel free to do a pull request for this :P\n. Hey @jusio sorry about the late reply and thanks for this PR! This change makes a lot of sense, if you can make the suggested comments then i can pull this in :)\n. Nice! That makes it easy :)\nThis looks good to land, ill just sync the change into Facebook, then merge it :)\n. Awesome, just landed this into FB. In the future we should probably do that check in the invariant via propTypes.\n. @wlis was this something you fixed?\n. Hey @jalateras, @ofersadgat was right the rowGetter needs to be a function. Check to see if that fixes it, if not you will need to look into your browserify config, process is a global in node which we use to check the environment type (dev or production), browserify normally defines this for you but maybe you have that turned off, maybe check your browserify detectGlobals config.\nIm going to close this out since its not a bug in the table per se, but let us know if you can't figure it out.\n. @ofersadgat that is correct, you will need to use the row index as the seed for your random number generator. Or just use some like the modulos operator: return colors[index % 3] which will be stable.\n. Closing this out since its not really something we can \"fix\" and is intended behavior :)\n. @jamnanlaw I have a fix ready to sync which fixes the two issues you pointed out :) with this change the table renders from the server great, the problem we then have is that react cannot mount onto the rendered HTML since its renders differently based on the environment :(, this is the main culprit: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/src/vendor_upstream/dom/translateDOMPositionXY.js#L23-L45. We will probably need to change the code to always render with top and left on the first pass then use translate if the browser supports after that.\nSo a long answer but yes we intend to support server rendering :)\n. Sorry no we haven't made any progress here, this just isn't a use case we have needed. The solution described above is still valid and shouldn't be too hard if someone wants to have a go at solving this.\n. I think reloadRowAtIndex fn would make sense given our existing API but what i would rather see is a more react \"like\" declarative API, although I don't have a good idea of what that would look like. If that looks like it will be a big change we may do this in the mean time. Any thoughts on this approach?\n. Good point! This makes a lot of sense, feel free to send a PR for this change or i can do it at some point :)\n. I would say its missing, we are missing a few events like this. If you want you can defined this on a individual cell via a cellRenderer. But we should look to adding these events to Rows.\n. We can probably look at doing this soon, although a pull request for these changes would certainly speed up the process :P\n. Something like this should work (i haven't tested it):\n``` javascript\nfunction handleDoubleClick(index, event) {\n  // handle dbl click\n}\nfunction cellRenderer(content, index) {\n  return (\n    {content}\n  );\n}\n```\nYou might need to move the default cell padding to this inner element to capture all the clicks.\n. @airwin have you tried the new allowCellsRecycling config in v3.0? It was designed to solve the use cases described here by not rendering columns when they leave the viewport.\ncc @wlis \n. With 0.6.0 you have the option to use your own Cell (so you dont need the 3+ divs that come with the current default cell), i'm hoping this will help make over head of the table less. Let us know if this release helps at all.\n. \\0/ Nice...\n. Awesome, thank you @ofersadgat!\n. Hey @nt591, thanks for the PR, sorry its not obvious but these API docs are auto generated from the source code. If you could make the change here: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/src/FixedDataTable.react.js#L237 it wont overwritten the next time we build the docs :)\n. Fixed via #54 :)\n. Looks good!\n. A couple of things, first you need to use gitraw so it gets the right headers for JS, then you will need to polyfill Object.assign which is where it gets a little hard :P \nI was able to get it going with JSBin: http://jsbin.com/zocituvuyi/2/edit\n. You need to define an onChange handler and then set the value, see: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components\n. http://jsbin.com/kuyixo/1/edit?js,output\nThe table wont rerender a cell unless the data for the cell changes, and since we were by passing the cells data input and referencing the state directly in the cellRenderer it didn't know the data had changed and hence didnt know to rerender. \n. You had a typo, you were setting the data for the clicked row back in place of the rows: http://jsbin.com/ribulu/2/edit\nMore correctly cellRenderers will not be called again unless the cells associated data changes.\n. http://jsbin.com/temufa/2/edit\nSo you need to create a new instance of your object data, its the same reason i was slice()ing the array. If you don't do this you will still have referentially equal objects and oldObject === newObject will still equal true. The react update helper might be helpful if you are doing lots of these updates.\n. Yeah, thats the one.\n. @eugene1g :open_mouth: \nWe should definitely add this to the main readme but at this point the browser support looks like this:\n- Chrome\n- Firefox (will be faster/better supported in the coming release)\n- IE9+\n  - IE11 - On Windows 8 touchpad two finger scrolling doesn't work.\n  - IE9 - Support is likely to be deprecated for this browser very soon.\n. @mkawalec nice catch, we should definitely document this :P but like @mfunkie said could you please add the prop type to https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/src/FixedDataTableColumn.react.js then if you run the docs build npm install && \n./build_helpers/buildAPIDocs.sh it will update the markdown file.\n. Hey @dannymk, You will need an ES6 compatible Object.assign polyfill. 'object-assign' is a good one, you can then do Object.assign = Object.assign || require('object-assign'); before you require FixedDataTable which should fix the problem.\n. Hey @matrinox, i have been thinking about this visibleRows style API for a while but i'm not totally convinced it would be needed. What would be the advantage to using this visibleRows callback over just batching up all data request within a single event loop and then breaking that into request batches? (other than the frame work providing the logic for you :P)\nHere is an example of how i would build the batching logic: http://jsbin.com/temufa/9/edit?js,output\nYou will notice it will also request data outside of the view based on where it thinks you will scroll to, because we are using the rowGetter we can take advantage of the row prerendering triggering requesting data.\n. Agree with @hedgerwang  but this does seem initially non obvious. I think this would be a good example we could add to the site. Im going to close this out and create a task for it.\n. @bizmurr sure i have added it to the list and created a jsbin example, its pretty similar to the sorting example.\n. @gsklee This is pretty weird, looks like it might be a lower level react problem, as from the screenshot it is rendering the correct value just the DOM is not being updated. Do you mind having a try at creating a simple repo case so i can dig into it? here is a good jsbin to start from: http://jsbin.com/valoco/5/edit?html,js,output.\n. Hey @dannymk, the fixed data table applies a very aggressive shouldComponentUpdate function, which stops the cellRenderer from being called unless some data associated with that renderer has changed. The way we figure our what data is needed to render a row is via the rowGetter, so the issue above is that the state you are expecting to update your cellRenderer is not returned from the rowGetter so the diff does know that something has changed.\nHere is an example of how it could work by embedding the data within the row object:\nhttp://jsbin.com/temufa/18/edit\nThe other way to provide this behavior is for the cellRenderer to just return a single react container which is responsible for subscribing to store data changes and updating the cell via setState. We do this for a lot of our applications but this only makes sense if for larger tables with a lot of different possible data types.\nWe are thinking about removing this aggressive shouldComponentUpdate functionality to make the table render more predictability but it will have a large performance cost if all cells rerender with each set update, so we are still trying to find the right balance here :)\n. @rovolution I created this example yesterday which shows how you can implement sorting which should help http://jsbin.com/temufa/10/edit?html,js,output\nAfter not seeing to much detail my guess as to your problem is that the data your updating via setState is not being returned from the headerDataGetter and so the headerRenderer doesn't see the data has changed and doesn't update.\n. Yes it was just simpler that way for this example but you can also pass more complex data via headerDataGetter, just remember if you want the cell to render the data returned needs to change :)\n. Im not sure i understand this change, could you give some more detailed information on what the current behavior is on render and what this effect this change will have?\n. @marcneuwirth Nice, yes this makes sense! Thanks for the detailed explanation. This should also be fixed when we move to the React.cloneElement API instead of cloneWithProps but this is a good interim solution.\n. @ondrejhlavacek thanks for bring this up. This is an interesting side effect of the way we are pooling react components and reusing them as the user scrolls. Maybe we can force them to unmount which might fix this, but we want to be careful we don't loss the ability to reuse the underlying DOM node.\n. Hey @gaearon, Thanks for this. We build the docs via react-docgen so i had to manually add the changes back to the source and merge, see https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/commit/45d64c0f5bda94548d05df5da825e4d124be0e7f\nThanks!\n. I have deleted the generated markdown files from the repo so it should be clearer for other in the future :)\n. Hey @gsklee Thanks for the issue, this sounds pretty easy to fix, we should just force intergers when the value comes in :P\n. Thanks for the PR! i have manually merged this here: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/commit/5a55671722b12accc4ff1d63d0c2089b9192a99a\n. Sounds like this is a dependency issue, feel free to reopen if your still having trouble with the new version after reinstalling.\n. @gsklee @benshimmin Sorry we know this is bad and are planing on fixing this for the next release. For now a hacky fix for this if you know you don't need any scrolling is to set overflowX=\"hidden\" overflowY=\"hidden\" http://jsbin.com/valoco/12/edit.\n. This should be fixed in the latest release :)\n. I will take this after this release so we don't break React 0.12 support\n. This should help with #5 :)\n. Hey @gsklee, thanks for the PR. Yeah this behavior is a little weird. So we have both maxHeight and height so our plan is to change height to make it work like you suggested (always stuck to the bottom) and then make sure maxHeight maintains the current behavior :)\n. They @gabelevi thanks for the PR we fixed this in 0.2.0 by allowing maxHeight or height which have the two different behaviors :)\n. @JedWatson Im using your babel-plugin-object-assign project here :) Unfortunately i couldn't use the project as a dependency as it was giving me an error about using two different instances of Babel, i think your project might need to use peerDeps to solve this but not sure. Anyway thanks for creating this!\n. @ifrit :) I have merged it in, we are aiming to do the release next week.\n. Hey @cesarandreu, @ifrit, @zackify sorry for the delay but we have now done the v0.2.0 release, with this code in it! Check it out, and please let us know if something doesnt work for you :)\n. @hipertracker I will build the dist files when we release. As for the React i had it that way was the browser global for react is window.React not lowercase but ill look for a way to support both. Thanks for the feedback!\n. @hipertracker after some sleuthing around other webpack configs i think have the solution now. If you could try the new changes that would be very helpful :)\n. Nice! Thanks for testing.\n. Hey @hipertracker i assume you got this going, the repo seems to be working fine for me. Pretty sweet demo as well!\n\n. @TomClarkson Sure that should be doable\n. This release is out! https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases/tag/v0.2.0\n. Not at the moment, rendering a row is currently very complex especially with fixed columns and it would be hard to allow a user to do this and still render correctly. This something we will think about when refactoring the core to be more flexible in the future but its not on the immediate road map.\n. Hey @difelice, thanks for the PR. I think this usecase is already covered by the user being able to determine if a column should be rendered at all:\n<Table>\n  <Column />\n  {hidden ? null : <Column />}\n</Table>\n. For this use case you can use the headerDataGetter on the Table component  to return the relevant data into the headerRenderer :)\n. I fixed this with #110, if you pull down master and then do a fresh npm install it should work :)\n. Hey @Andreyco, PR would be awesome! This is definitely something we want, we just haven't had the time to do it.\nSo the way we have thought about approaching this is to split out layout specific css and styling \"theme\" css. The layout styles should include anything that is required to make the table function/ position correctly (like you described). With the \"theme\" being everything else including borders and such. Ideally we would split the current stylesheets in two different css files for each one and create different classes for both the styling hooks and the layout. In the long term we see the layout styles being included as inline CSS in the react component but we don't think our tooling this ready for this yet, with this in mind it makes splitting the class names out more important so its easier to remove and pull the style inline in the future :)\nLet me know of you have any questions or need any help.\ncc @jbonta Do you have any other thoughts on this?\n. Hey @jmcpeak, hmm i think the order of requires is wrong in that fiddle which is throwing it off. I tired getting the project working in jsfiddle a while back but i couldn't get it easily setup due to the need for the object.assign polyfill before defining the table, but this should be easier in the next version of the table where this is not needed. I did setup the project with jsbin which has been working well for me: http://jsbin.com/valoco/10/edit?html,js,output\n. Hey @allanbond shouldn't it be enough to install via bower install facebook/fixed-data-table and reference the dist files? What advantage does having the bower.json file give? Bower can look at git tags right?\n. Hey @DanielMiddleton the table handles most of this logic for you and will call the rowGetter function as the rows get close to being in view, the one key thing is you will need to give it an absolute number of rows so the scollbar size can be estimated but you can update the value over time as you get more data. Here is an example of how this can be implemented http://jsbin.com/temufa/8/edit?html,js,output)\n. Hey @Andreyco, Sorry for the slow response. This PR looks really good! Ill get @jbonta to give it a full review soon. Also I can take a look at the build step stuff if you wanna remove it from this PR.\nThanks for putting this together!\n. @jbonta how do you feel about having all the theme styles in a single file? Is it worth splitting them out?\n. No we don't have our own chat room but i do hang out in the #reactjs IRC chat room if you want to ping me there :)\n. Nice find! Would love a PR for this :)\n. Awesome, thanks for the PR @llh1, if you can do the change @hedgerwang suggested then i can merge this in :)\n. Awesome, thank you @llh1!\n. Thanks for bring this up this will be super useful for when taking on accessibility.\ncc @jbonta \n. So we have unit tests setup for this code in the FB code base which we run when we sync code changes back in to FB we just haven't had the time to pull them out and setup the infra in this repo. I agree this is pretty bad though :(, ill try setting this up before the next release.\n. Hmm interesting its working for me on Chrome and Firefox on Mac, it looks like Zynga scroller is failing for you. Do you mind checking to see if your getting any failed network requests?\n. Hmmm thats interesting i will have to take a deeper look, thanks for the detailed info!\n. Hmm looks like this is a CDN issue, i will see if i can find a more reliable place to host this file.\n. Yeah you will just want to setup a custom cellRenderer on the column which you can then render what ever you want with react :)\n. @ConAntonakos I think in the latest React you would write it like this if your not using JSX:\nfunction renderLink(cellData){\n  return React.createElement('div', { dangerouslySetInnerHTML: {__html: cellData} });\n}\nDoes that work?\n. Hey sorry @iammerrick i'm probably too late to help you but there was nothing inherently wrong with what you had i don't see any reason it shouldn't work. \nI ran the following code and it worked fine for me, maybe try with the latest release?\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nvar FixedDataTable = require('fixed-data-table');\nrequire('fixed-data-table/dist/fixed-data-table.css');\nfunction DataTableHandler() {\n  return class DataTableHandler extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n  var Table = FixedDataTable.Table;\n  var Column = FixedDataTable.Column;\n\n  // Table data as a list of array.\n  var rows = [\n    ['a1', 'b1', 'c1'],\n    ['a2', 'b3', 'c2'],\n    ['a3', 'b3', 'c3']\n  ];\n\n  function rowGetter(rowIndex) {\n    return rows[rowIndex];\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <Table\n      rowHeight={50}\n      rowGetter={rowGetter}\n      rowsCount={rows.length}\n      width={5000}\n      height={5000}\n      headerHeight={50}>\n      <Column\n        label=\"Col 1\"\n        width={3000}\n        dataKey={0}\n      />\n      <Column\n        label=\"Col 2\"\n        width={2000}\n        dataKey={1}\n      />\n    </Table>\n  );\n}\n\n}\n}\nexport default DataTableHandler();\n```\n. Hey @mikestead Thanks for the PR!\n@jbonta @wlis What do you think about changing the scroll bar to not overlap the header?\n. This should work now with the latest releases dist build, you will need to make sure you install and require React before the table.\n. Exciting! I feel a release coming :P\n. Nice, thanks for the quick PR, hmmm would prefer to use Math.round so its a bit clearer whats happening + round will go to the closest value not just strip the decimal :)\ncc @wlis Do you think we should do it here or on the resulting value so we don't need to round every prop?\n. Hey @cesarandreu thanks for bringing this up! I have put this info into the github release :) https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases/tag/v0.2.0 And we will continue to do this for all future releases.\n. With the \"Replacing getDOMNode with findDOMNode\" commit we will be breaking compatibility with react 0.12.x this seems fine to me but we should make this clear in the release notes and update the package.json.\n. This looks good to go, merge when ready.\n. Awesome! Looks good to me. Release when ready :)\n. Awesome! once you have cleaned up the minor lint issues and squashed the changes into one commit you can merge when your ready :)\n. Awesome!\n. cc @jbonta \n. This looks good to me. Merge when ready :)\n. So much red :heart::heart::heart: this is looking really good! Lets get this in.\n. FixedDataTable will definitely work with the beta since FB runs React master internally. But last time i tried to do this i couldn't get the npm dependencies to allow a beta as well as the normal versions. If anyones has an idea how the npm dependency versioning should look for this i will be happy to do the release.\n. @cesarandreu thanks for the info! Let us know if the release doesn't solve the problem for you.\n. @bolinfest i'm not happy with the approach taken here, as a library special casing one particular consumers use case like isn't a maintainable solution for us given all the consumers we have and their needs. Its great we could unblock you for this but lets work together to find a way to alias the react module at your build level (babel has a way to do this) as we wont be able to maintain this special case long term and i would guess not all libraries are going to be so accommodating.\n. I would recommend for this using a transparent border, this way you keep the width but it looks like its not there. Our default layout theme does this. In the future we are looking to make this stuff configurable via inline styles but its currently assumed in a lot of places\n. The other thing you can do is in each cell on componentDidMount you check the contents height via React.getDOMNode().outerHeight (or something like that) then use that to reset the height of the row. The downside is this will be pretty hard to get to run a performant way. The auto content sizing is not something we are looking at adding to this library.\n. Hey @fullvlad yes this is possible, at FB we have this functionality with FixedDataTable for one of our ads products. For something complex like this I would suggest connecting each cell to its data source directly, we do this via Flux, each cell connects to its data store based on the row index and binds to events which will set state on the cell (rather than passing the data back through the data getter).\n. Check out the 0.6.0 release with this there are no limitations on what can be passed to a cell since we don't own any of this state.\n. @vojtech-dobes I though this was the case (that rowHeightGetter would only be called for visible rows), @wlis any thoughts here?\n. Thanks @masonicboom i have fixed this with fb7b6f4494af0c3c7a20c55e7d11271b1ebb9777\n. I have done a quick release with @chentsulin's PR to allow react@0.14.0-rc1 as a dep (https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases/tag/v0.4.7) and will try to do another release shortly to clean up the warnings.\n. Sorry there is no standard way in the FixedDataTable to do this, in theory you should be able to build this in your cell by measuring all the column content after render then set the width. This is not an API we expect to add to the table since it would be very hard to do it a performant way.\n. Yeah you likely are missing a bind somewhere.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome thanks for this @chentsulin!\n. I have pushed out the 0.5.0-rc1 package which adds support for React 0.14.0, if someone can try it out and make sure its working for you i can publish the stable 0.5.0 release.\n. Thanks @musbaig! i have now published 0.5.0\n. Awesome, glad to hear this. Let us know if you run into problems with this!\n. You will need to listen to the window resize event and then update the table with when it changes, here is how we do it for the examples page: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/cf28c0e78a3859c9a6e5d94fc84912e28d64f62a/site/examples/ExamplesPage.js#L100-L116\n. Hey @johnnyji check out the latest 0.6.0-rc1 release (docs are here for now). With this, the fixed data table no longer needs any data via the rowGetter so you can use whatever data structure you want :)\n. Sorry its not possible with the current release. If you check out the latest 0.6.0-rc1 release (docs are here for now). With this, the fixed data table no longer needs any data via the rowGetter so you can access data however you want :)\n. cc @ehzhang @wlis\n. No worries :) I simplified the examples a bunch to :)\nWill be great to finally release your awesome work!\n. :dancers::dancers::dancers: \n. This code has been released as v0.6.0-rc1! Im working on docs now for the full release.\n. Sorry we are halfway through a release, the example in the readme is for the 0.6.0 release which is only released as 0.6.0-rc1. You are welcome to try this out (it will be release properly very shortly) or the docs for the current release are on the site.\n. Hey @marduke182, thanks for the PR. The way i was thinking about in the past to solve this was to have some state that tells us we are in the first pass and always render positions with left and top (since we know all browsers support this but not translate pos), then on any other render from there we can use the fancy translate3d stuff. See the inline message for why i think the current approach in this PR is bad. Do you think you would be able to update this to do that?\n. Hmm i dont think this flag necessarily needs to live on state, since we don't actually want to force a render as a result of changing it, we just need a flag to signify that we are now out of the first render. The down side of this is it will make the render more non-pure, but it wont be to much worse than it already was (since it already relies on global state).\nso:\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  this._initialRender = false;\n}\nLets also create a wrapper around translateDOMPositionXY module that does this logic (translateDOMPositionXY is hard for us to change since its a core FB module), so if is this._initialRender then use left and top then after this we just delegate to translateDOMPositionXY.\nThanks for taking this on!\n. Thank you for this!\n. Oh thanks for the issue, i think i know what i might have missed when messing with the examples for the  latest release.\n. cc @wlis @jbonta @dehamilton\n. Oh yeah we should fix this up, so whats happening here is this is where we reach the maximum size of a div that the browser supports, so it just stops rendering after that height, we should change all the examples to instead of rendering 1,000,000 rows we render 500,000 or something. If you have time to submit a PR this is the the number you need to change for each example: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/blob/master/examples/ResizeExample.js#L32\n. oh wow :( thanks for this!\n. Oh nice! Would love a PR for that.\n. Thanks for working on this @zpao. The synced code looks good, it contained everything I expected. The build system is looks nice although i didn't look into it with a huge amount of detail. Let me know if you want me to do another review or help out with testing.\n. let me know if i broke anything :D. ",

You can now mark your columns using allowCellsRecycling prop and this will allow table to not render cells in these columns when they are outside of viewport. \nThis doesn't allow table to have any number of columns, but we tested on 1000 columns and it works quite well. There will be additional example coming soon.\n. @krystian-3c thanks for reporting this! The first part is going to be merged in #156.\nFor the second one we will try to fix that soon. \n. Did you specify the onColumnResizeEnd prop in the table? The table doesn't actually resize columns, it just provides UI. The onColumnResizeEnd will get info about updated column size and ultimately you will have to render the table with updated columns.\n. Thank you for pointing this out. We will add changelog for 0.3.0 soon.\n. @box-turtle I am not sure that this will come with the new API, but removing unnecessary overflow:hidden from many places in our CSS will also happen soon.\n. This request is AWESOME!\nI wish we were able to get rid of isFooterCell and isHeaderCell or at least minimise branching base on that because it makes code more difficult to understand.\nAlso please add trailing comas in missing places and empty lines before function declarations.\nOne more thing I didn't think through, but might be worth looking at is columnKey. Fact that people can pass components with some props already defined now, would also make it very easy to get the columnKey out from FixedDataColumn and make people pass it to their components themselves if they need it.\n. That looks cool. I went very quickly over and I see that you are still using ReactComponentWithPureRenderMixin in Cells/Rows. With that and no data there is no way for user to force the table to render new contents for cells. I don't think we can assume that everyone who uses table has cells subscribing to data sources and is ok with not re-rendering cells. At this point the FixedDataTableCell.react with the set of props will nearly always return false from shouldComponentUpdate.\n. @Martynas-P Thanks for reporting this. There is a plan to get these translation values down by not rendering fake div with dimensions of whole table and some smaller blocks instead. We didn't have time to work on that yet. \n. Thanks for fixing this @pieterv!\n. Yeah, we should properly fix this by not rendering div that huge, but have couple smaller divs wrapping rows and control them well.\n. @hedgerwang Haven't you solved this issue with https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/commit/a907bafe8403a82a057363af0bda271f76ea8fc0 ?\n.

You can now mark your columns using allowCellsRecycling prop and this will allow table to not render cells in these columns when they are outside of viewport. \nThis doesn't allow table to have any number of columns, but we tested on 1000 columns and it works quite well. There will be additional example coming soon.\n. @krystian-3c thanks for reporting this! The first part is going to be merged in #156.\nFor the second one we will try to fix that soon. \n. Did you specify the onColumnResizeEnd prop in the table? The table doesn't actually resize columns, it just provides UI. The onColumnResizeEnd will get info about updated column size and ultimately you will have to render the table with updated columns.\n. Thank you for pointing this out. We will add changelog for 0.3.0 soon.\n. @box-turtle I am not sure that this will come with the new API, but removing unnecessary overflow:hidden from many places in our CSS will also happen soon.\n. This request is AWESOME!\nI wish we were able to get rid of isFooterCell and isHeaderCell or at least minimise branching base on that because it makes code more difficult to understand.\nAlso please add trailing comas in missing places and empty lines before function declarations.\nOne more thing I didn't think through, but might be worth looking at is columnKey. Fact that people can pass components with some props already defined now, would also make it very easy to get the columnKey out from FixedDataColumn and make people pass it to their components themselves if they need it.\n. That looks cool. I went very quickly over and I see that you are still using ReactComponentWithPureRenderMixin in Cells/Rows. With that and no data there is no way for user to force the table to render new contents for cells. I don't think we can assume that everyone who uses table has cells subscribing to data sources and is ok with not re-rendering cells. At this point the FixedDataTableCell.react with the set of props will nearly always return false from shouldComponentUpdate.\n. @Martynas-P Thanks for reporting this. There is a plan to get these translation values down by not rendering fake div with dimensions of whole table and some smaller blocks instead. We didn't have time to work on that yet. \n. Thanks for fixing this @pieterv!\n. Yeah, we should properly fix this by not rendering div that huge, but have couple smaller divs wrapping rows and control them well.\n. ",

The rowGetter function seems to also be called hundreds/thousands of times depending on the amount of scrolling that takes place, this many calls to the rowGetter doesn't seem very efficient or is this supposed to happen? The implementation of my rowGetter is also very simple (see the screenshot) and the props that are used in the getter doesn't change very often.\nWhat I am especially worried about is the \"wasted time\" rendering these tables. The React documentation states: ' \"Wasted\" time is spent on components that didn't actually render anything, e.g. the render stayed the same, so the DOM wasn't touched.' \nDo you experience a lot of \"wasted time\" when using the table component in your implementation or does this seem to be a problem specific to my implementation. \nIf you wish to view my implementation of the table API I could send you my source code, perhaps you can find the performance bottleneck.\n\n. Thank you so much for your help! The table is more responsive now.\n. Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement.

That way we dont have to rely on any detection.\n. You can see an example in my boilerplate repo: https://github.com/ofersadgat/fixed-data-table-simple\n.

(or at least that is my best theory).\n. While I would still like 'reloadRowAtIndex' it is possible to do this by having a container which updates itself sitting under the Table, see https://github.com/ofersadgat/fixed-data-table-simple as an example.\n. I think that the React-style approach is something like what I did in my example (see the repo linked above for more detail):\n```\nvar renderCell = function(cellData, cellDataKey, rowData, rowIndex, columnData, width){\n  var renderLoaded = function(rowData){\n    if (cellDataKey == 'thumbnail'){\n      return ;\n    }\n    return {rowData[cellDataKey]};\n  };\nreturn (\n    }\n        renderLoaded={renderLoaded} />\n  );\n};\n```\nLoadingObjectContainer is an object which will notify all listeners when the data changes. LoadingCellContainer is the object that listens to changes from the LoadingObjectContainer.\nIn that example you can declarativly state what to render when the data is unloaded vs loaded.

Furthermore, it is simpler because it removes the necessity of having all of the signaling between LoadingObjectContainer  and LoadingCellContainer . \nA problem with that approach would be that if you wanted to do some sort of animation between the unloaded and the loaded state, you would be at a loss. Therefore, an alternative to reloadRowAtIndex might be: getRowDataAtIndex which will allow you to use the above approach because it will let you store the LoadingObjectContainer in the table and the actual data in your own store.\nIn summary, reloadRowAtIndex is probably better for people to get started but getRowDataAtIndex is more react-y and allows you to do animations while allowing your stores to hold their own types.\n. Also, I have added a few improvements such as adding the abstraction that the table will expand to fill the size of the div that it is in so you dont need to care about managing the sizes manually. Also, instead of using the refresh hack to check and see if the div size has changed it uses a library which handles that with an event.\n. The reason that the table requires the size parameter is because it uses the fixed size to remove elements from the DOM that arent displayed on screen.\nIn order to do this the way that you want, you would have to hook window.onScroll, use that to update the dom by finding the visible region of the screen and then rendering just that section using absolute positioning. While that might be a good feature to add in the future, as I have hopefully illustrated, it is a lot of work.\n. You can do what I did: make the table resize to the containing div: https://github.com/ofersadgat/fixed-data-table-simple/\n. To be fair, most of it isnt actually boilerplate code.

I could try as you suggested to force a refresh and simultaneously scroll to wherever they were (if I can even figure out where that is), but that would still cause the table to move (because the user might have been on a boundary between rows).

This issue has been addressed in the most recent version (v0.3.0), which includes the onRowDoubleClick property in the Table component.\n. @binarykitchen changelog has been updated.\n. @matrinox could you clarify what you mean by this, and what performance costs you observe?\n. Hmm! I just checked it out, and it looks like you're right - there are duplicate calls to the rowGetter function. However, if you add logs to a cellRenderer function, you'll notice that the cells themselves don't actually re-render.\nThe performance of the rowGetter is negligible, as the real bottleneck here is rendering. I've decided to close this issue as it is more of a micro-optimization.\n. Thanks for bringing this up. Making width an optional field would be a great addition to the table. Otherwise, I would recommend using a window.resize handler as mentioned by @parties to explicitly update the width of your table.\n. The JSBin examples in the original post have been updated to work with React ~0.13 and fixed-data-table v0.3.\n- Create example of requesting + batching data requests based on visible content - http://jsbin.com/kuhene/5/edit?html,js,output (#66, #28)\n- Sorting example - http://jsbin.com/pukiri/6/edit (#29)\n- Filtering example - http://jsbin.com/fupiyipoba/3/edit\n. Hi @HectorWon ,\nI wrote up a quick example in JSBin here: http://jsbin.com/lajada/1/edit?html,js,output\nThe table property scrollToColumn here indeed scrolls to that column.\nI've also added scrollToRow, so that you can see that in action as well.\nLet me know if you have any more questions! :)\n. @HectorWon yes, this is the current behavior for those two properties.\n. @toppetoppe here you go: http://jsbin.com/buzevofasa/1/edit?html,js,output\nNote that this is just a simple merge of both sort and filter examples from above. The general concept to note here is that the only difference is that instead of only one action changing the source data (filteredRows) you have two.\n. Thanks for bringing this up! We're currently working on solving this issue.\n. This has been fixed in v0.4.0! Thanks!\n. Closing, as addressed by PR #121. Woo!\n. This has been closed due to oldness - if this issue persists, feel free to reopen!\n. @Andreyco thanks for the PR! It's been merged in with a few changes.\n. Hi! \nI whipped up a JSBin to test, and this doesn't seem to be an error for React 0.13 + FixedDataTable v0.3.0\nhttp://jsbin.com/wirubo/1/edit?html,js,output\n. Thank you for bringing this up! This appears to be a duplicate of #15. \n. This definitely seems like a good behavior to have, and we'll make note of it for our next release. In the meantime, you can calculate the header text using another function, as you are given the column index. Otherwise, you may be interested in applying a custom headerRenderer for the columns in question.\n. Indeed, this is indeed very possible and not very difficult to implement. However, with any change in the behavior of the table, we need to make sure to check our internal uses to make sure that it doesn't break anything before we sync it up with the public repo, and report changes. Thank you for your patience.\n. This has been fixed for version v0.4.0. Thanks!\n. Hi! Can you explain a little bit more about what you mean here?\n. Thanks for the PR!

This is a known issue. Unfortunately, because the table relies on overriding the browser's native scroll to determine table position, the browser's 'find' interferes by forcing the scroll position.\nWe'll definitely look into ways to fix this! Definitely annoying. :S\n.

No problem :)\nI'm going to close this issue since the documentation has been updated with this information. If still unclear, feel free to reopen!\n. @binarykitchen a changelog for version v0.3.0 has been added - most notably, support for React 0.12 has been discontinued.\nYou can find it here: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases\n. Hi!\nThanks for bringing up this bug. Can you explain how you came across it, and the steps to reproduce it?\nIn the examples, I've tried adding the text-align: right; property to both the table and the container, as well as set the Column align property to right, but the resize guide appears to be working correctly.\n. @gillesruppert so far, I've been unable to reproduce this bug in Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and IE. I'm going to be closing this issue, but feel free to open it again if you encounter this bug again!\n. Hi!\nI looked into this, and created this JSBin to play around with adding this select box.\nhttp://jsbin.com/ladiko/1/edit?html,js,output\nUnfortunately, this appears to be a compatibility issue with the react-select component and react-table's CSS, but a default HTML  works fine.\nLet me know if you have any questions, or would like me to prod deeper :)\n. Hey @Martynas-P !\nThanks for bringing up this bug! Indeed, this doesn't seem to be the expected behavior. I'll look into a fix.\ncc @pieterv \n. This bug has been fixed in v0.4.0. Thanks!\n. @Martynas-P sorry about the slow response! As @davidxi mentions in his PR, this is because we currently expect a footerDataGetter to return a truthy value (some kind of data) to determine whether or not we want to render a cell and use the footerRenderer function provided.\nI've categorized this as a bug and a need to fix documentation, as this behavior should mimic that of the header, and this should be mentioned in the docs.\nHowever, in future versions ( #155 ) we may be looking for an alternate API to render this table that doesn't depend on the link between the data getters and renderers.\n. Hmm! We haven't tested this with material UI - have you tried including the fixed-data-table.css file manually?\n. Glad to hear it's all fixed @kenr ! \nFixed-data-table relies on including the css in order to render properly, regardless of the method you use to bundle and/or transpile the jsx or javascript (in this case, browserify). \n. @binarykitchen thanks for bringing this up! Do you think you could attach a screenshot of the issue? I have been so far unable to reproduce it on my end.\nThis may be because of the behavior of translate3d, and I'm guessing that it might have something to do with the setting of a width/height with a fractional value (like a percentage).\nTranslate3d is used because it triggers hardware acceleration in order to maximize performant scrolling, by giving us explicit control on the location of the elements within the viewport.\n. Hi! Thanks for bringing this up. The examples on the site will be working again soon, there has just been a small hiccup with a recent commit.\n. @skmasq things should be working again. The site publishing script happened to pick up a few of my local changes by accident, sorry about that!\n. @jbonta good catch and suggestion - those changes have been made.\n. @cosminnicula currently there isn't a way to specify a colspan-like attribute on the row level, but this may be a feature for a future release. Sorry :(\n. Unfortunately, as referenced in #169, this is likely because the two components do not have compatible CSS. :(\n. In the case of a nested datastructure, I'm on more of the side of keeping it as Number or String since it seems to be more of a common convention to represent nested paths as strings.\n. @hipertracker sorry for the frustration!\nRight now, the way that the table works is that headerDataGetter is a function used by each column to get that header's \"data\", which is the label value given as the first argument to the headerRenderer function. In order to determine whether or not the header will need to re-render using the headerRenderer function, the table checks for any changes in the return value of the headerDataGetter. No data changes, no re-render.\nThe headerDataGetter function has a single argument, which is the column number, which you canu se to get a label.\nI agree that the documentation isn't clear about how this works, and it's definitely quite confusing. As referenced in #155 , future versions will have a different API dealing with this data vs render problem.\n. Looks good, thanks for the pull request!\n. I've tested with the latest on npm, and haven't encountered this error. Can you be more specific as to how to reproduce this bug?\n. Looks good, thanks for the pull request!\n. Hi @sharky93, what do you mean by fetching text that has been selected in a cell?\n. Can you explain what you're trying to accomplish? If you are trying to get data from a highlighted selection, window.getSelection() is a perfectly valid method.\n. rowCount should be consistent for the entire table - one column should not have more or less. From the arguments in a  rowClickHandler, you won't be able to access them, but considering you have to provide a rowsCount to the table itself, you should be able to access it from there.\n. from the onRowClick prop, row index is the second argument. This does not also provide the column index, unfortunately.\n. This will very likely not be something that will be added to the API in the future. Instead, we are looking to cut down on the API so you can more flexibly attach these onClick and onDoubleClick listeners (or anything) without depending on the Column or Table API.\n. I'm going to be closing this issue as providing an API for this information is not in the scope of the table's responsibility.\n. Yes, this is beyond the scope of FixedDataTable. You can provide your own Column components as children of the Table component. When the columns you provide are updated, the table will update accordingly.\nThere is no API to add new columns, as you must provide the columns anyway.\nHere's a simple example:\nhttp://jsbin.com/putuzi/4/edit?html,js,output\n. I'm going to be closing this issue as mentioned above, as adding an API for column addition is beyond the scope of this table.\n. Thanks for the pull request! Unfortunately, this isn't something we can take, as these are properties that can be added to the cell you provide to the column yourself. We don't want to pass these in from the Column level.\n. Hi!\nI would recommend keeping a selected property in your data itself. FixedDataTable is meant to render whatever data you provide. Selection state can be managed by a cellRenderer you provide. Likewise, changing selection state should be managed by the component that you provide the cellRenderer.\nBecause of this, I don't think that this would be a good change for the API, since it is up to you to manage the state of your individual components through components that you define, and data that you provide.\n. Hi! Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, this feature is outside of the scope of the table - you must provide the table with data and components, and how you manage that data is up to you! The table otherwise takes care of virtualizing the rows to maintain high performance scrolling. \nThis decision keeps the table flexible enough to allow you to choose whatever you'd like to go in the cell, so you can adjust it to your use case. \nIf you would like inline-editing, you can look into creating a component that does that by using cellRenderer and cellDataGetter. \n. You're welcome :)\nI'll be closing this issue now, but if you feel the need you can re-open it. Thanks!\n. @Siyfion sorry for not seeing this sooner! Looking through the link you provided, I don't anticipate too much issue in terms of rendering if you used the inline version, but you'd probably have trouble with the pop-over. Also, because of the way that cells are routinely destroyed/rerendered, it may actually be a bit tricky to actually initialize each row with jQuery.\n. Data loading in the rowGetter is actually a fine way of doing this, as in the example above. The table will render rows based off of the the data that backs it, and changing the data that the rowGetter is based off of will accommodate the loading behavior that you might want.\n. Hey @cosminnicula!\nRight now, the focus is on a new API design that will make it much easier to create your own components for the table and maximize flexibility. Once we have stabilized on that API, it should be easier to focus on accessibility!\n. @rmilesson this release is currently still in development - we're also working to make sure that the migration goes smoothly before making such large API changes.\n. Hey @Andreyco! The way that fixed-data-table is actually able to work is because we take over native scrolling and replace it with our own scrollbar. That's currently how we're able to achieve the performance that we do.\nI'm going to close this issue because it does not seem to be applicable to our implementation - if I misunderstood you, please feel free to reopen!\n. @andreypopp the files in the vendor_upstream folder are actually modules and utilities that we pull in internally, so ideally we shouldn't be making any changes to them, as the that would change some expected behavior. \nOtherwise, I'm a bit confused as to how to reproduce this issue, and a bit worried that this would halt scrolling completely while a mouse button is clicked.\n. Looks like I can only successfully reproduce this in Firefox, and not Chrome. Interesting!\nWhile this is certainly looks a bit janky I'm uncertain that this would be the best way to fix this.\n. @difelice This must've been missed in the syncing process. Thanks so much for catching it!\n. @difelice thanks for the pull request!\nI'll batch this into the next v0.4.x release. However, v0.5.0 (for the future #193) will be focused on removing these Table level API additions in favor of defining your own row components with your own props.\n. Hi! Fixed data table works by virtualizing your cells and only rendering what is in view. The cells themselves are rendered based off of data that is provided via the rowGetter, and individual cell state is not preserved as scrolling will recreate the cell as necessary.\nAt the your level, you will need to actually change the data source that backs the cell in question. \n. This largely depends on how you choose to feed in your data!\nWe try to accommodate for the instance where the data is actually fed in through an outside source, and the cells act to manipulate that data source. In this case, you're using state of the parent, which is all good. Other implementations may choose to manipulate data in a flux store, for example.\nSo basically, what you have seems to be a perfectly reasonable way of doing this :)\n. No problem!\nWe're actually focusing on changing the API right now, and the examples should follow.\n. Unfortunately, because this is a unique use case where we're virtualizing cells, we don't currently have a best general solution :(\nThere is a consideration that we should be saving state somewhere, but this isn't a use case that React works best with, and we can't really easily restore that state. Right now, the best option is to use props to render information properly using props.\nI'm currently working to see if this is something that we can fix for the next version though.\n. @sidnair while turning off virtualization could be useful here, at that point the table does little more than render rows for you - something that you could easily do on our own (and you'd have a lot more control over state, content, etc). If you aren't rendering large quantities of data and you stateful cells are a requirement, it may be of better use to you to render your own table, and possibly paginate if you do run into performance setbacks.\nAs for performance - we find a performance benefit in our use case where we deal with hundreds if not thousands of rows of data (FDT has been tested with ~1000000 rows!) and want to maintain consistent performance no matter how many rows we may need to render or change.\nI'll keep this open though, since it is something we should address - but it might not make it into the next release.\n. Hi! This is a known bug (see #149). I'm going to close this issue in favor of the previous - but unfortunately, we cannot currently prevent this behavior because of the way we manage scrolling. \n. Certainly! This is actually one of the reasons why we're moving into using cell 'templates' instead of renderers and getters in the next release. That way, you can assign your own classNames for your cells without needing an API to do so. This will likely be included as a part of the release #193 .\n. Hi @rmilesson! Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'not possible'?\nThis current behavior is currently one that we expect - perhaps you might be interested in having something like a CSS rule that sets the opacity of the scrollbar to 0, but brings it back up on hover? You can customize the Scrollbar's CSS in the fixed-data-table-style.css file, or by adding your own CSS.\n. I'm closing this because there hasn't been any update, and a solution exists. Feel free to reopen if this persists!\n. @MalucoMarinero nice find! I looked through your commit and the changes look pretty useful. I'll have to do some further testing, but a PR for this would be great! Thanks! :+1: \n. @wlis the columnKey is used as an identifier and one of the arguments for the onColumnResizeEndCallback - even though users can provide their own to the cell, I believe that it is better to have a reserved property on the Column level than specify in the documentation to include that property in particular on the cell for resizing.\nI'm open to changing it to something different (like columnId or something), and we don't necessarily have to pass it into the cell too - I just thought it'd be nice since it can save a lot of typing :P\n. This has been abandoned for #221, which includes this plus a transition layer.\n. Thanks for the pull request! Unfortunately, this is not something that we can take at this time. We're in the process of changing the API and moving away from using renderer functions and adding to the API in favor of stripping down the API so that you can use your own components (like an expander) without depending on the table to take care of it for you.\nI'm going to be closing this PR, but if anything changes I'll reopen it.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Have you tried adding padding to the parent container?\nOtherwise, could you explain this in greater detail or provide a screenshot? I'm a bit confused as to what you mean here, visually :S\n. Sorry, I'm still confused - is this the behavior you currently have, or the one you're trying to achieve?\n. @chrisdrackett thanks for clarifying - I've been able to solve this in JSBin.\nhttp://jsbin.com/cafeza/edit?html,css,js,output\nThis isn't a problem with FixedDataTable, but the way it appears you're using overflow: auto or overflow: scroll. Read here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11695354/css-right-margin-does-not-work-inside-a-div-with-overflow-scroll\nBasically, you'll want to apply the display: inline-block rule to the table, or its wrapper.\n. If you need to remove the scroll bar in the table, you can feel free to make it non visible with CSS, or by making the overall table width the sum of the widths of the table columns so that the table itself doesn't scroll.\nWith regards to user experience, this concept of a scrolling table within a scrollable wrapper is already not a great experience, scroll bar or not. \n. Thanks for the pull request! I'll do some testing on this first, but it looks pretty good :)\n. Looks great! This will be a part of the next minor version release.\n. To help debug - have you defined your onColumnResizeEndCallback, and if so, can you include that code too? \nThanks :)\n. Hey @pavanpodila , I have not been able to reproduce this bug - I wrote up an example on usage here, attempting to mimic what you're doing. You should also remove the .bind calls on your rowGetter and onColumnResizeEndCallback functions, since React component methods may only be bound to the component instance.\nhttp://jsbin.com/safipo/2/edit?html,js,console,output\nUnless this can be reproduced, I'll close this issue - but I'll leave it open for now while some debugging happens!\n. Actually, it looks like what you're getting as a dataKey is not the same way you represent your columnWidths. You set your Column's dataKey as \"request.url\", so when you get the dataKey back form the column resize callback, you're receiving \"request.url\", not .url as you expect in your Column width.\nYou'll likely need to change that line to this.state.tableWidths['request.url'].\nLet me know if that solved your problem!\n(as a side note, the return value of cellDataGetter does not change the dataKey that identifies that column in callbacks like the resizeCallback, in case that was what you expected)\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. So as to keep with the latest releases with react, we've added support for React v0.14.0-beta3 with v0.4.6 (but not beta1 or beta2).\n. Hey @prachp!\nThis is a known issue, and stems from the way our rows are rendered. This does not really occur until the  you exceed half a million rows (with that height), and isn't a priority for now.\n. Hey @weixing2014, the method of reordering columns would not change with this release - in order to reorder columns, you will need to implement your own logic to pass in the re-organized columns under the <Table> Component.\n. @yrokhlin - I was just about to make a comment regarding this.\nThe current state of this PR is incompatible with the current v0.5.0 with the new React support for 0.14, and is also incomplete in a few other places regarding performance. A version similar to this may be released soon, but not in this specific PR.\nI closed this mostly to clean up the list of PRs. @wlis or @pieterv will be better able to answer questions regarding the state of the table source.\nAs an added note, I do not speak on behalf of Facebook with regards to the state of this project.\n. Hi @tehandyb! Unfortunately, because this version uses React's cloneWithProps function on the result of the cellRenderer, the ref prop is not preserved.\nSince this method is now deprecated, in next versions, we will instead be using React.cloneElement, which will copy refs, and hopefully fix this problem. In the meantime, you may have more success adding your own custom property to the component in your cellRenderer.\n. Hey @gappture! \nThe cellRenderer should only fire when the results from either the rowGetter changes for a specific rowIndex or the results from the cellDataGetter changes. If the information you provide there changes often, that might be the source of these hundreds/thousands of renders.\nOtherwise, your cellRenderer appears to be fairly straightforward.\nI'd like to hear more about how you're using this, in case that sheds more light to this performance problem.\n. @gappture \nIt's actually not unusual, but actually expected for the rowGetter to fire many times - it's actually really fast. The problem is when the return value does not evaluate as true for otherwise equivalent information, which makes the table think - \"oh hey, something's changed - we should rerender!\"\nIn your rowGetter, you create a new data array every time the function is called. Unfortunately, this means that when we check the previous value, javascript does not think that it's equal, even if the data is the 'same'.\nYou can see for yourself by typing into the javascript console something like:\n```\n[1, 2, 3] ==  [1, 2, 3]\n\nfalse\n```\n\nThanks, javascript :P\nInstead, you'll want something that we can use to evaluate as true, like a reference to the original data. If your this.props.data[rowIndex+1] is an array, you might be able to solve your problem by changing your code to\n_rowgetter: function(rowIndex){\n  return this.props.data[rowIndex+1];\n}\n. Glad to hear it :)\n. Adding PureRenderMixin means it will never update - if you try it, the table just sits there completely stationary :p\n. That is actually how the table works right now! The rerender of s cell is determined by the results of the rowGetter or the cellDataGetter. When that changes, a render is triggered. \n. @khankuan are you experiencing poor performance? It'd be great to see if its something that we should address.\n. Great to hear it! If you don't mind I'm going to close this issue then - feel free to open it if anything changes.\n. Hi @alolis! Because we manage our own scrolling for performance, we don't use the native scrollbar.\n. cloneWithProps has been removed in version v0.4.2! :)\n. Hi @fullvlad! \nWe actually maintain that the direct children of the table are either the Fixed Data Table Column group or fixed data table column. To get this kind of behavior, you may want to instead use a generator function to create those columns.\n. As a really rough case, it's just a function that returns a react element, like:\nfunction createColumn(id){\n   // What you want here\n   return <Column\n     headerRenderer={renderHeader}\n     label={id}\n     //...your other props\n     />\n}\n. I've closed this since there hasn't been any activity - hopefully this has solved your problem. Let me know  if you still need help!\n. To achieve the effect that we have in the Facebook Ads Manager, we use a controlled scrolling situation where we watch for wheel events on the overall page and scroll the table by changing the ownerHeight and scrollTop properties.\nChanging the ownerheight property allows the header to become \"fixed\" at a certain height, and changing scrollTop scrolls the table.\nUnfortunately, we don't have a simplified example of this in action.\n. Thanks for the suggestion! Just added that.\n. cc @pieterv\n. This arose while trying to add support for atom. You can safely ignore this error though. Otherwise, you may wish to revert back to 0.4.2 (the only difference is that)\n. I\"m sorry about that :( I'm going to try and release a patch to 0.4.3 as soon as possible.\n. @AlesJiranek @YoYuUm I can't seem to reproduce this error on my end - 0.4.4 builds using webpack without error for me. Are you using the provided webpack config or your own?\nIf this continues to be an error, I may have to roll back these changes in the next release. :\\\n. Hi everybody! Please update to the latest 0.4.5 version, which should fix these issues since we've basically reverted back.\nThe problems here arose from attempting to support react-for-atom within, and @HankMcCoy is correct on the reasons why this was more than unfortunate. We're going to look for better ways of supporting Atom without affecting this library.\nSorry about this release hiccup! Let me know if this issue needs to be reopened.\n. This is a pretty tricky problem since in order to virtualize the cells, we need to know an explicit height for each row. \nCurrently, the best way I know of doing this is to use a heuristic to determine the expected row height for any given cell. :\\\n. Currently, the cells choose to re-render when a comparison of the previous data and the next updated data is different. \nIt sounds like you are modifying the objects directly, so when the shouldComponentUpdate does a comparison of old vs new, it returns true as a direct comparison of an object reference to itself is true. So it won't update, since effectively oldCellData === newCellData. \nYou may have more success in using something like Immutable.js to wrap the objects, or create an instance of a new object. \n. Are you triggering an attempt to render in the table at a higher level in any way when you go through the rows?\nPerhaps by setting a state in the parent component may help?\n. Hmm. Actually, I believe that currently it's actually blocked at a higher level for the rowData. If the old rowData === new rowData equality passes then it will never think to go further. \nWe're actually in the middle of changing this behavior, it's kind of frustrating. \n. For performance reasons, we're not going to inspect the contents of a row and do any sort of deep comparison.\nIn the future, we won't be choosing re-renders based on data, but letting you choose to do it based on your own cell components and your own shouldComponentUpdate functions.\n. Inspecting arbitrarily deeply nested row objects isn't something we want to do as a part of the table, and adding to the API just makes the table more bloated. The table itself shouldn't be handling your data anyway, and that's a behavior we'd like to change.\nPlease see #221 for more information on the next release that will happen later this week. I'll be making updates to documentation and description in preparation.\n. @fullvlad you can use the cellRenderer to render the cells connected to your flux stores, and then use the rowGetter function to get the value in your store. The rowGetter when you do this will be used to decide rendering of the cells, and you don't have to use that data when you use the cellRenderer. \n. Fixed Data table does not have pagination built in, if that is your question. \nRather, it will render whatever data you give it through the rowGetter. Changing a page means that you would just supply it with different data (presumably a second pages worth). \nI'm not certain what you mean by the second question - the table works with large numbers of rows by virtualizing the row position to render only what is in the viewport. \n. Yup, this is true. The table is just the table. We don't intend to support these features as it would make the table less flexible in the process.\n. Hi @daannijkamp! We can't actually take this PR because we actually prefer trailing commas. Sorry!\n. Yeah, there are a few instances where variables are leftover and aren't used. It isn't important that they be removed for now though.\n. These nested nodes are currently necessary for the method of vertical alignment for each cell. We're currently working on a release that does flatten this though. \n. If you're using the ES6 class syntax for react components, you will have to bind this when you use rowGetter (which might be, for example, in your render() function).\nSee this: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html in the 'No autobinding' section.\n. Yes there is!\nUse the footerHeight and footerDataGetter properties in the Table and for your columns, optionally specify a footerRenderer.\nThe footer is fixed on the bottom, and span all of the columns.\n. The table doesn't support a footer at the table level - to get that kind of functionality, you can show/hide the footer by changing the footerHeight from 0 to your value.\nHowever, it sounds like your first idea would be totally reasonable - that is, rendering a component that is absolutely positioned and overlays the bottom of the table. I don't think that the drawback there is significant, since that is how the fixed footer behaves in the first place.\n. The table requires an explicit pixel width in order to properly calculate the layout. You will need to set this value yourself.\n. Thanks for the rebase and the perf fixes!\n. :tada: :tada: :tada:\n. Duplicate of #15 \n. For v0.4.0, rows now include both classes .public_fixedDataTableRow_highlighted and either .public_fixedDataTableRow_odd or .public_fixedDataTableRow_even!\n. This issue has been addressed in the most recent version (v0.3.0), which includes the onRowDoubleClick property in the Table component.\n. @binarykitchen changelog has been updated.\n. @matrinox could you clarify what you mean by this, and what performance costs you observe?\n. Hmm! I just checked it out, and it looks like you're right - there are duplicate calls to the rowGetter function. However, if you add logs to a cellRenderer function, you'll notice that the cells themselves don't actually re-render.\nThe performance of the rowGetter is negligible, as the real bottleneck here is rendering. I've decided to close this issue as it is more of a micro-optimization.\n. Thanks for bringing this up. Making width an optional field would be a great addition to the table. Otherwise, I would recommend using a window.resize handler as mentioned by @parties to explicitly update the width of your table.\n. The JSBin examples in the original post have been updated to work with React ~0.13 and fixed-data-table v0.3.\n- Create example of requesting + batching data requests based on visible content - http://jsbin.com/kuhene/5/edit?html,js,output (#66, #28)\n- Sorting example - http://jsbin.com/pukiri/6/edit (#29)\n- Filtering example - http://jsbin.com/fupiyipoba/3/edit\n. Hi @HectorWon ,\nI wrote up a quick example in JSBin here: http://jsbin.com/lajada/1/edit?html,js,output\nThe table property scrollToColumn here indeed scrolls to that column.\nI've also added scrollToRow, so that you can see that in action as well.\nLet me know if you have any more questions! :)\n. @HectorWon yes, this is the current behavior for those two properties.\n. @toppetoppe here you go: http://jsbin.com/buzevofasa/1/edit?html,js,output\nNote that this is just a simple merge of both sort and filter examples from above. The general concept to note here is that the only difference is that instead of only one action changing the source data (filteredRows) you have two.\n. Thanks for bringing this up! We're currently working on solving this issue.\n. This has been fixed in v0.4.0! Thanks!\n. Closing, as addressed by PR #121. Woo!\n. This has been closed due to oldness - if this issue persists, feel free to reopen!\n. @Andreyco thanks for the PR! It's been merged in with a few changes.\n. Hi! \nI whipped up a JSBin to test, and this doesn't seem to be an error for React 0.13 + FixedDataTable v0.3.0\nhttp://jsbin.com/wirubo/1/edit?html,js,output\n. Thank you for bringing this up! This appears to be a duplicate of #15. \n. This definitely seems like a good behavior to have, and we'll make note of it for our next release. In the meantime, you can calculate the header text using another function, as you are given the column index. Otherwise, you may be interested in applying a custom headerRenderer for the columns in question.\n. Indeed, this is indeed very possible and not very difficult to implement. However, with any change in the behavior of the table, we need to make sure to check our internal uses to make sure that it doesn't break anything before we sync it up with the public repo, and report changes. Thank you for your patience.\n. This has been fixed for version v0.4.0. Thanks!\n. Hi! Can you explain a little bit more about what you mean here?\n. Thanks for the PR! It's been merged in, with the adjustment to the z-index (100).\n. Thanks for the pull request! A simplified version of this has been merged into version v0.4.0.\n. Hi @nbostrom !\nThis appears to be working with react v0.13 and fixed-data-table v0.3.0. This example uses both most recent react and fixed-data-table versions.\nhttp://jsbin.com/pukiri/6/edit?html,js,output\nThe example is also up on the main site, https://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/example-sort.html\n. This is a known issue. Unfortunately, because the table relies on overriding the browser's native scroll to determine table position, the browser's 'find' interferes by forcing the scroll position.\nWe'll definitely look into ways to fix this! Definitely annoying. :S\n. Hey @rundis , I ran your gist, and encountered the error you mentioned.\nIf you change line 18 to the most up to date release, it works fine.\nI've attached a gist here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/ehzhang/daf4453df43a4dede3d8\n\n. Version v0.4.0 has been released with bugfixes and splitting layout and theme styles.\n. Please see #193 !\n. Indeed, the documentation isn't really clear about this: it'll be added soon. Thanks!\n. @muraveill, please use the onColumnResizeEndCallback. wlis was abbreviating the prop name.\n. @delafont - you'll want to use the onColumnResizeEndCallback on the Table, as it is a Table property.\nYou can see the documentation here: http://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/api-table.html\nIt is admittedly a little confusing, but the callback doesn't run on a single column but watches for any resize event on all columns, so it exists at the table level.\n. No problem :)\nI'm going to close this issue since the documentation has been updated with this information. If still unclear, feel free to reopen!\n. @binarykitchen a changelog for version v0.3.0 has been added - most notably, support for React 0.12 has been discontinued.\nYou can find it here: https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/releases\n. Hi!\nThanks for bringing up this bug. Can you explain how you came across it, and the steps to reproduce it?\nIn the examples, I've tried adding the text-align: right; property to both the table and the container, as well as set the Column align property to right, but the resize guide appears to be working correctly.\n. @gillesruppert so far, I've been unable to reproduce this bug in Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and IE. I'm going to be closing this issue, but feel free to open it again if you encounter this bug again!\n. Hi!\nI looked into this, and created this JSBin to play around with adding this select box.\nhttp://jsbin.com/ladiko/1/edit?html,js,output\nUnfortunately, this appears to be a compatibility issue with the react-select component and react-table's CSS, but a default HTML  works fine.\nLet me know if you have any questions, or would like me to prod deeper :)\n. Hey @Martynas-P !\nThanks for bringing up this bug! Indeed, this doesn't seem to be the expected behavior. I'll look into a fix.\ncc @pieterv \n. This bug has been fixed in v0.4.0. Thanks!\n. @Martynas-P sorry about the slow response! As @davidxi mentions in his PR, this is because we currently expect a footerDataGetter to return a truthy value (some kind of data) to determine whether or not we want to render a cell and use the footerRenderer function provided.\nI've categorized this as a bug and a need to fix documentation, as this behavior should mimic that of the header, and this should be mentioned in the docs.\nHowever, in future versions ( #155 ) we may be looking for an alternate API to render this table that doesn't depend on the link between the data getters and renderers.\n. Hmm! We haven't tested this with material UI - have you tried including the fixed-data-table.css file manually?\n. Glad to hear it's all fixed @kenr ! \nFixed-data-table relies on including the css in order to render properly, regardless of the method you use to bundle and/or transpile the jsx or javascript (in this case, browserify). \n. @binarykitchen thanks for bringing this up! Do you think you could attach a screenshot of the issue? I have been so far unable to reproduce it on my end.\nThis may be because of the behavior of translate3d, and I'm guessing that it might have something to do with the setting of a width/height with a fractional value (like a percentage).\nTranslate3d is used because it triggers hardware acceleration in order to maximize performant scrolling, by giving us explicit control on the location of the elements within the viewport.\n. Hi! Thanks for bringing this up. The examples on the site will be working again soon, there has just been a small hiccup with a recent commit.\n. @skmasq things should be working again. The site publishing script happened to pick up a few of my local changes by accident, sorry about that!\n. @jbonta good catch and suggestion - those changes have been made.\n. @cosminnicula currently there isn't a way to specify a colspan-like attribute on the row level, but this may be a feature for a future release. Sorry :(\n. Unfortunately, as referenced in #169, this is likely because the two components do not have compatible CSS. :(\n. In the case of a nested datastructure, I'm on more of the side of keeping it as Number or String since it seems to be more of a common convention to represent nested paths as strings.\n. @hipertracker sorry for the frustration!\nRight now, the way that the table works is that headerDataGetter is a function used by each column to get that header's \"data\", which is the label value given as the first argument to the headerRenderer function. In order to determine whether or not the header will need to re-render using the headerRenderer function, the table checks for any changes in the return value of the headerDataGetter. No data changes, no re-render.\nThe headerDataGetter function has a single argument, which is the column number, which you canu se to get a label.\nI agree that the documentation isn't clear about how this works, and it's definitely quite confusing. As referenced in #155 , future versions will have a different API dealing with this data vs render problem.\n. Looks good, thanks for the pull request!\n. I've tested with the latest on npm, and haven't encountered this error. Can you be more specific as to how to reproduce this bug?\n. Looks good, thanks for the pull request!\n. Hi @sharky93, what do you mean by fetching text that has been selected in a cell?\n. Can you explain what you're trying to accomplish? If you are trying to get data from a highlighted selection, window.getSelection() is a perfectly valid method.\n. rowCount should be consistent for the entire table - one column should not have more or less. From the arguments in a  rowClickHandler, you won't be able to access them, but considering you have to provide a rowsCount to the table itself, you should be able to access it from there.\n. from the onRowClick prop, row index is the second argument. This does not also provide the column index, unfortunately.\n. This will very likely not be something that will be added to the API in the future. Instead, we are looking to cut down on the API so you can more flexibly attach these onClick and onDoubleClick listeners (or anything) without depending on the Column or Table API.\n. I'm going to be closing this issue as providing an API for this information is not in the scope of the table's responsibility.\n. Yes, this is beyond the scope of FixedDataTable. You can provide your own Column components as children of the Table component. When the columns you provide are updated, the table will update accordingly.\nThere is no API to add new columns, as you must provide the columns anyway.\nHere's a simple example:\nhttp://jsbin.com/putuzi/4/edit?html,js,output\n. I'm going to be closing this issue as mentioned above, as adding an API for column addition is beyond the scope of this table.\n. Thanks for the pull request! Unfortunately, this isn't something we can take, as these are properties that can be added to the cell you provide to the column yourself. We don't want to pass these in from the Column level.\n. Hi!\nI would recommend keeping a selected property in your data itself. FixedDataTable is meant to render whatever data you provide. Selection state can be managed by a cellRenderer you provide. Likewise, changing selection state should be managed by the component that you provide the cellRenderer.\nBecause of this, I don't think that this would be a good change for the API, since it is up to you to manage the state of your individual components through components that you define, and data that you provide.\n. Hi! Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, this feature is outside of the scope of the table - you must provide the table with data and components, and how you manage that data is up to you! The table otherwise takes care of virtualizing the rows to maintain high performance scrolling. \nThis decision keeps the table flexible enough to allow you to choose whatever you'd like to go in the cell, so you can adjust it to your use case. \nIf you would like inline-editing, you can look into creating a component that does that by using cellRenderer and cellDataGetter. \n. You're welcome :)\nI'll be closing this issue now, but if you feel the need you can re-open it. Thanks!\n. @Siyfion sorry for not seeing this sooner! Looking through the link you provided, I don't anticipate too much issue in terms of rendering if you used the inline version, but you'd probably have trouble with the pop-over. Also, because of the way that cells are routinely destroyed/rerendered, it may actually be a bit tricky to actually initialize each row with jQuery.\n. Data loading in the rowGetter is actually a fine way of doing this, as in the example above. The table will render rows based off of the the data that backs it, and changing the data that the rowGetter is based off of will accommodate the loading behavior that you might want.\n. Hey @cosminnicula!\nRight now, the focus is on a new API design that will make it much easier to create your own components for the table and maximize flexibility. Once we have stabilized on that API, it should be easier to focus on accessibility!\n. @rmilesson this release is currently still in development - we're also working to make sure that the migration goes smoothly before making such large API changes.\n. Hey @Andreyco! The way that fixed-data-table is actually able to work is because we take over native scrolling and replace it with our own scrollbar. That's currently how we're able to achieve the performance that we do.\nI'm going to close this issue because it does not seem to be applicable to our implementation - if I misunderstood you, please feel free to reopen!\n. @andreypopp the files in the vendor_upstream folder are actually modules and utilities that we pull in internally, so ideally we shouldn't be making any changes to them, as the that would change some expected behavior. \nOtherwise, I'm a bit confused as to how to reproduce this issue, and a bit worried that this would halt scrolling completely while a mouse button is clicked.\n. Looks like I can only successfully reproduce this in Firefox, and not Chrome. Interesting!\nWhile this is certainly looks a bit janky I'm uncertain that this would be the best way to fix this.\n. @difelice This must've been missed in the syncing process. Thanks so much for catching it!\n. @difelice thanks for the pull request!\nI'll batch this into the next v0.4.x release. However, v0.5.0 (for the future #193) will be focused on removing these Table level API additions in favor of defining your own row components with your own props.\n. Hi! Fixed data table works by virtualizing your cells and only rendering what is in view. The cells themselves are rendered based off of data that is provided via the rowGetter, and individual cell state is not preserved as scrolling will recreate the cell as necessary.\nAt the your level, you will need to actually change the data source that backs the cell in question. \n. This largely depends on how you choose to feed in your data!\nWe try to accommodate for the instance where the data is actually fed in through an outside source, and the cells act to manipulate that data source. In this case, you're using state of the parent, which is all good. Other implementations may choose to manipulate data in a flux store, for example.\nSo basically, what you have seems to be a perfectly reasonable way of doing this :)\n. No problem!\nWe're actually focusing on changing the API right now, and the examples should follow.\n. Unfortunately, because this is a unique use case where we're virtualizing cells, we don't currently have a best general solution :(\nThere is a consideration that we should be saving state somewhere, but this isn't a use case that React works best with, and we can't really easily restore that state. Right now, the best option is to use props to render information properly using props.\nI'm currently working to see if this is something that we can fix for the next version though.\n. @sidnair while turning off virtualization could be useful here, at that point the table does little more than render rows for you - something that you could easily do on our own (and you'd have a lot more control over state, content, etc). If you aren't rendering large quantities of data and you stateful cells are a requirement, it may be of better use to you to render your own table, and possibly paginate if you do run into performance setbacks.\nAs for performance - we find a performance benefit in our use case where we deal with hundreds if not thousands of rows of data (FDT has been tested with ~1000000 rows!) and want to maintain consistent performance no matter how many rows we may need to render or change.\nI'll keep this open though, since it is something we should address - but it might not make it into the next release.\n. Hi! This is a known bug (see #149). I'm going to close this issue in favor of the previous - but unfortunately, we cannot currently prevent this behavior because of the way we manage scrolling. \n. Certainly! This is actually one of the reasons why we're moving into using cell 'templates' instead of renderers and getters in the next release. That way, you can assign your own classNames for your cells without needing an API to do so. This will likely be included as a part of the release #193 .\n. Hi @rmilesson! Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'not possible'?\nThis current behavior is currently one that we expect - perhaps you might be interested in having something like a CSS rule that sets the opacity of the scrollbar to 0, but brings it back up on hover? You can customize the Scrollbar's CSS in the fixed-data-table-style.css file, or by adding your own CSS.\n. I'm closing this because there hasn't been any update, and a solution exists. Feel free to reopen if this persists!\n. @MalucoMarinero nice find! I looked through your commit and the changes look pretty useful. I'll have to do some further testing, but a PR for this would be great! Thanks! :+1: \n. @wlis the columnKey is used as an identifier and one of the arguments for the onColumnResizeEndCallback - even though users can provide their own to the cell, I believe that it is better to have a reserved property on the Column level than specify in the documentation to include that property in particular on the cell for resizing.\nI'm open to changing it to something different (like columnId or something), and we don't necessarily have to pass it into the cell too - I just thought it'd be nice since it can save a lot of typing :P\n. This has been abandoned for #221, which includes this plus a transition layer.\n. Thanks for the pull request! Unfortunately, this is not something that we can take at this time. We're in the process of changing the API and moving away from using renderer functions and adding to the API in favor of stripping down the API so that you can use your own components (like an expander) without depending on the table to take care of it for you.\nI'm going to be closing this PR, but if anything changes I'll reopen it.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Have you tried adding padding to the parent container?\nOtherwise, could you explain this in greater detail or provide a screenshot? I'm a bit confused as to what you mean here, visually :S\n. Sorry, I'm still confused - is this the behavior you currently have, or the one you're trying to achieve?\n. @chrisdrackett thanks for clarifying - I've been able to solve this in JSBin.\nhttp://jsbin.com/cafeza/edit?html,css,js,output\nThis isn't a problem with FixedDataTable, but the way it appears you're using overflow: auto or overflow: scroll. Read here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11695354/css-right-margin-does-not-work-inside-a-div-with-overflow-scroll\nBasically, you'll want to apply the display: inline-block rule to the table, or its wrapper.\n. If you need to remove the scroll bar in the table, you can feel free to make it non visible with CSS, or by making the overall table width the sum of the widths of the table columns so that the table itself doesn't scroll.\nWith regards to user experience, this concept of a scrolling table within a scrollable wrapper is already not a great experience, scroll bar or not. \n. Thanks for the pull request! I'll do some testing on this first, but it looks pretty good :)\n. Looks great! This will be a part of the next minor version release.\n. To help debug - have you defined your onColumnResizeEndCallback, and if so, can you include that code too? \nThanks :)\n. Hey @pavanpodila , I have not been able to reproduce this bug - I wrote up an example on usage here, attempting to mimic what you're doing. You should also remove the .bind calls on your rowGetter and onColumnResizeEndCallback functions, since React component methods may only be bound to the component instance.\nhttp://jsbin.com/safipo/2/edit?html,js,console,output\nUnless this can be reproduced, I'll close this issue - but I'll leave it open for now while some debugging happens!\n. Actually, it looks like what you're getting as a dataKey is not the same way you represent your columnWidths. You set your Column's dataKey as \"request.url\", so when you get the dataKey back form the column resize callback, you're receiving \"request.url\", not .url as you expect in your Column width.\nYou'll likely need to change that line to this.state.tableWidths['request.url'].\nLet me know if that solved your problem!\n(as a side note, the return value of cellDataGetter does not change the dataKey that identifies that column in callbacks like the resizeCallback, in case that was what you expected)\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. So as to keep with the latest releases with react, we've added support for React v0.14.0-beta3 with v0.4.6 (but not beta1 or beta2).\n. Hey @prachp!\nThis is a known issue, and stems from the way our rows are rendered. This does not really occur until the  you exceed half a million rows (with that height), and isn't a priority for now.\n. Hey @weixing2014, the method of reordering columns would not change with this release - in order to reorder columns, you will need to implement your own logic to pass in the re-organized columns under the <Table> Component.\n. @yrokhlin - I was just about to make a comment regarding this.\nThe current state of this PR is incompatible with the current v0.5.0 with the new React support for 0.14, and is also incomplete in a few other places regarding performance. A version similar to this may be released soon, but not in this specific PR.\nI closed this mostly to clean up the list of PRs. @wlis or @pieterv will be better able to answer questions regarding the state of the table source.\nAs an added note, I do not speak on behalf of Facebook with regards to the state of this project.\n. Hi @tehandyb! Unfortunately, because this version uses React's cloneWithProps function on the result of the cellRenderer, the ref prop is not preserved.\nSince this method is now deprecated, in next versions, we will instead be using React.cloneElement, which will copy refs, and hopefully fix this problem. In the meantime, you may have more success adding your own custom property to the component in your cellRenderer.\n. Hey @gappture! \nThe cellRenderer should only fire when the results from either the rowGetter changes for a specific rowIndex or the results from the cellDataGetter changes. If the information you provide there changes often, that might be the source of these hundreds/thousands of renders.\nOtherwise, your cellRenderer appears to be fairly straightforward.\nI'd like to hear more about how you're using this, in case that sheds more light to this performance problem.\n. @gappture \nIt's actually not unusual, but actually expected for the rowGetter to fire many times - it's actually really fast. The problem is when the return value does not evaluate as true for otherwise equivalent information, which makes the table think - \"oh hey, something's changed - we should rerender!\"\nIn your rowGetter, you create a new data array every time the function is called. Unfortunately, this means that when we check the previous value, javascript does not think that it's equal, even if the data is the 'same'.\nYou can see for yourself by typing into the javascript console something like:\n```\n[1, 2, 3] ==  [1, 2, 3]\n\nfalse\n```\n\nThanks, javascript :P\nInstead, you'll want something that we can use to evaluate as true, like a reference to the original data. If your this.props.data[rowIndex+1] is an array, you might be able to solve your problem by changing your code to\n_rowgetter: function(rowIndex){\n  return this.props.data[rowIndex+1];\n}\n. Glad to hear it :)\n. Adding PureRenderMixin means it will never update - if you try it, the table just sits there completely stationary :p\n. That is actually how the table works right now! The rerender of s cell is determined by the results of the rowGetter or the cellDataGetter. When that changes, a render is triggered. \n. @khankuan are you experiencing poor performance? It'd be great to see if its something that we should address.\n. Great to hear it! If you don't mind I'm going to close this issue then - feel free to open it if anything changes.\n. Hi @alolis! Because we manage our own scrolling for performance, we don't use the native scrollbar.\n. cloneWithProps has been removed in version v0.4.2! :)\n. Hi @fullvlad! \nWe actually maintain that the direct children of the table are either the Fixed Data Table Column group or fixed data table column. To get this kind of behavior, you may want to instead use a generator function to create those columns.\n. As a really rough case, it's just a function that returns a react element, like:\nfunction createColumn(id){\n   // What you want here\n   return <Column\n     headerRenderer={renderHeader}\n     label={id}\n     //...your other props\n     />\n}\n. I've closed this since there hasn't been any activity - hopefully this has solved your problem. Let me know  if you still need help!\n. To achieve the effect that we have in the Facebook Ads Manager, we use a controlled scrolling situation where we watch for wheel events on the overall page and scroll the table by changing the ownerHeight and scrollTop properties.\nChanging the ownerheight property allows the header to become \"fixed\" at a certain height, and changing scrollTop scrolls the table.\nUnfortunately, we don't have a simplified example of this in action.\n. Thanks for the suggestion! Just added that.\n. cc @pieterv\n. This arose while trying to add support for atom. You can safely ignore this error though. Otherwise, you may wish to revert back to 0.4.2 (the only difference is that)\n. I\"m sorry about that :( I'm going to try and release a patch to 0.4.3 as soon as possible.\n. @AlesJiranek @YoYuUm I can't seem to reproduce this error on my end - 0.4.4 builds using webpack without error for me. Are you using the provided webpack config or your own?\nIf this continues to be an error, I may have to roll back these changes in the next release. :\\\n. Hi everybody! Please update to the latest 0.4.5 version, which should fix these issues since we've basically reverted back.\nThe problems here arose from attempting to support react-for-atom within, and @HankMcCoy is correct on the reasons why this was more than unfortunate. We're going to look for better ways of supporting Atom without affecting this library.\nSorry about this release hiccup! Let me know if this issue needs to be reopened.\n. This is a pretty tricky problem since in order to virtualize the cells, we need to know an explicit height for each row. \nCurrently, the best way I know of doing this is to use a heuristic to determine the expected row height for any given cell. :\\\n. Currently, the cells choose to re-render when a comparison of the previous data and the next updated data is different. \nIt sounds like you are modifying the objects directly, so when the shouldComponentUpdate does a comparison of old vs new, it returns true as a direct comparison of an object reference to itself is true. So it won't update, since effectively oldCellData === newCellData. \nYou may have more success in using something like Immutable.js to wrap the objects, or create an instance of a new object. \n. Are you triggering an attempt to render in the table at a higher level in any way when you go through the rows?\nPerhaps by setting a state in the parent component may help?\n. Hmm. Actually, I believe that currently it's actually blocked at a higher level for the rowData. If the old rowData === new rowData equality passes then it will never think to go further. \nWe're actually in the middle of changing this behavior, it's kind of frustrating. \n. For performance reasons, we're not going to inspect the contents of a row and do any sort of deep comparison.\nIn the future, we won't be choosing re-renders based on data, but letting you choose to do it based on your own cell components and your own shouldComponentUpdate functions.\n. Inspecting arbitrarily deeply nested row objects isn't something we want to do as a part of the table, and adding to the API just makes the table more bloated. The table itself shouldn't be handling your data anyway, and that's a behavior we'd like to change.\nPlease see #221 for more information on the next release that will happen later this week. I'll be making updates to documentation and description in preparation.\n. @fullvlad you can use the cellRenderer to render the cells connected to your flux stores, and then use the rowGetter function to get the value in your store. The rowGetter when you do this will be used to decide rendering of the cells, and you don't have to use that data when you use the cellRenderer. \n. Fixed Data table does not have pagination built in, if that is your question. \nRather, it will render whatever data you give it through the rowGetter. Changing a page means that you would just supply it with different data (presumably a second pages worth). \nI'm not certain what you mean by the second question - the table works with large numbers of rows by virtualizing the row position to render only what is in the viewport. \n. Yup, this is true. The table is just the table. We don't intend to support these features as it would make the table less flexible in the process.\n. Hi @daannijkamp! We can't actually take this PR because we actually prefer trailing commas. Sorry!\n. Yeah, there are a few instances where variables are leftover and aren't used. It isn't important that they be removed for now though.\n. These nested nodes are currently necessary for the method of vertical alignment for each cell. We're currently working on a release that does flatten this though. \n. If you're using the ES6 class syntax for react components, you will have to bind this when you use rowGetter (which might be, for example, in your render() function).\nSee this: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html in the 'No autobinding' section.\n. Yes there is!\nUse the footerHeight and footerDataGetter properties in the Table and for your columns, optionally specify a footerRenderer.\nThe footer is fixed on the bottom, and span all of the columns.\n. The table doesn't support a footer at the table level - to get that kind of functionality, you can show/hide the footer by changing the footerHeight from 0 to your value.\nHowever, it sounds like your first idea would be totally reasonable - that is, rendering a component that is absolutely positioned and overlays the bottom of the table. I don't think that the drawback there is significant, since that is how the fixed footer behaves in the first place.\n. The table requires an explicit pixel width in order to properly calculate the layout. You will need to set this value yourself.\n. Thanks for the rebase and the perf fixes!\n. :tada: :tada: :tada:\n.

The handful of code changes that are a part of this were just copied out from the internal version. Some open PRs could probably get closed as a result of better use of shared dependencies (eg #387).\n. Ok, everything is updated and actually builds now. I'm 99.99% certain it doesn't run properly (especially since cssVar is just going to throw right now: https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/150/files#diff-5060a7b6b38915d3ac82bf25f1a2e74cR11). I'm still thinking on the best way to actually make that work. I don't want to duplicate the colors list, which currently we have partially in here, so perhaps I'll move it up into a standalone package in fbjs and we can have fbjs & the css transform consume it\u2026\n. Motivation is that we have a bunch of infra built around gulp that we're using for our other projects, making it much easier to contribute for people at FB (especially, but hopefully also people in open source). Using that shared infra also means that we don't have 7 different ways of doing the same thing, each slightly differently (eg converting providesModule to commonjs).\n. Alright, I think this is just about done. I tested the built package with both the dist and npm builds (via browserify).\nThere's still a bit of followup work to do but it's pretty much ready to start using our shipit tools.

I apologize for leaving this project in limbo and not addressing your concerns. I have archived this project after doing a final release to make it compatible with React v16.. I ended up making this change slightly differently, but thanks!\n. > Will this include any issue fixes or merges from other PR's?\nNo, this is purely to get this building and syncing better with the tooling we have. The handful of code changes that are a part of this were just copied out from the internal version. Some open PRs could probably get closed as a result of better use of shared dependencies (eg #387).\n. Ok, everything is updated and actually builds now. I'm 99.99% certain it doesn't run properly (especially since cssVar is just going to throw right now: https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/150/files#diff-5060a7b6b38915d3ac82bf25f1a2e74cR11). I'm still thinking on the best way to actually make that work. I don't want to duplicate the colors list, which currently we have partially in here, so perhaps I'll move it up into a standalone package in fbjs and we can have fbjs & the css transform consume it\u2026\n. Motivation is that we have a bunch of infra built around gulp that we're using for our other projects, making it much easier to contribute for people at FB (especially, but hopefully also people in open source). Using that shared infra also means that we don't have 7 different ways of doing the same thing, each slightly differently (eg converting providesModule to commonjs).\n. Alright, I think this is just about done. I tested the built package with both the dist and npm builds (via browserify).\nThere's still a bit of followup work to do but it's pretty much ready to start using our shipit tools. The website doesn't build at all (need to learn more webpack voodoo) but the code builds.  There's sti\nFWIW, while the actual code here hasn't changed too much, we might want to clean up a little bit and then ship it as 0.7. The biggest immediate change is that CSS class names have changed (using hyphen instead of underscore). The upgrade to Babel 6 means the build is pretty different bit-wise, though functionally it should be pretty similar.\n. I clearly never did this and just archived the project. Oh well.. Thanks for your pull request. I apologize for leaving this project in limbo and not addressing your concerns. I have archived this project after doing a final release to make it compatible with React v16.. This project is not actively maintained at the moment. Many of the people involved have taken on other responsibilities and haven't had the time to dedicate to this. I have an in-progress pull request (#402) to make it easier for us to maintain moving forward, but we may need some help after that (I'm not actually involved in the project, just work on open source at FB so have some incentive to make this better). There are some others who want to help so I hope we get it to a good point soon.\nIn the mean time or if you aren't interested in waiting for the revival, I've heard many good things about https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-virtualized.\n. You can consider my comment above an official statement. I work at Facebook and work with the people involved with this project.\n. We did not get this to a good place so I have archived the project. Sorry for the confusion and frustration this has caused.. This project is not officially deprecated yet so not going to take this. It's not actively maintained but also not deprecated. If/When that happens, there's a chance we'll list a couple alternatives, not just 1.\n. Let's leave the issue open. We'll want to fix it here too soon :) The fix they have in the fork is definitely a correct fix.\n. Please use https://www.facebook.com/help/326603310765065/ to report issues with the Facebook website.\n. Thanks!\n. Just shipped 0.6.2 with this.\n. We've been doing it for React forever too. But I don't like it (mostly because the value proposition isn't really there). We should continue shipping dist/ to npm and then we can use something like npmcdn, which can even serve a zip file for bower. We could also set up cdnjs/jsdelivr to pull those files whenever we publish to npm.\nEdit: And yes we can use the releases feature too. That's also marginally useful so personally I'm pretty meh about that.\n. > The files for Bower are in a separate repo\nOh yea, that's what I meant. I didn't quote you but I was responding to that proposal :)\n. Just pushed a fix (should be anyway). I'll ship that as 0.6.3.\n. Thanks for your pull request.

As a work-around I've just been vendoring or using forked versions, but it's far from ideal :(.\nBased on this issue's discussion, it looks like you could set the dependency to:\njson\n{\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \">=0.13.0 || ^0.14.0-alpha\"\n  }\n}\nLooking at libs in the wild, react-dnd's package.json has:\njson\n{\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \">=0.13.0 <0.15.0 || 0.14.0-beta1\"\n  }\n}\nHowever, (I think?) that won't work with newer 0.14 releases. (e.g. 0.14.0-beta3)\nAnother lib, react-redux, apparently just straight-up removed the peer dependency.\n. Awesome, the new API looks a lot nicer. Have you done any benchmarks that you could share?\nWould you consider publishing it as 0.5.0-alpha.0 or similar on npm so it's easier to try out?\nHaving an intermediate release that lets you use both APIs would be a really nice touch, it lets you avoid having to convert all your tables at once, which can be annoying.\n. You can use react-overlays (or react-bootstrap if you're using bootstrap styles). They provide an Overlay component.

If you're need to handle a large number of columns and you're looking for an alternative, react-virtualized added support for grids (large number of both columns and rows) in the latest release.\n. @pieterv any update on doing a release with this :)? \n. Awesome, thanks @pieterv! Seems to be working. \n. Why We Should Stop Using Bower \u2013 And How to Do It\n. @kursion You want npm and webpack. Webpack solve all those problems correctly. AFAIK, bower doesn't have any of those things you mentioned either. \nA Reasonable Starting Point for Building a Web App\n. Cool! Thanks :D. \n. No plans for implementing #49? :( \n. Oh cool, I'll try it out, thanks :D. \n. @binarykitchen:\n\nMajor version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.\n\nsource\n+1 to changelog though :D \n. That's great to hear @pieterv! As a work-around I've just been vendoring or using forked versions, but it's far from ideal :(.\nBased on this issue's discussion, it looks like you could set the dependency to:\njson\n{\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \">=0.13.0 || ^0.14.0-alpha\"\n  }\n}\nLooking at libs in the wild, react-dnd's package.json has:\njson\n{\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \">=0.13.0 <0.15.0 || 0.14.0-beta1\"\n  }\n}\nHowever, (I think?) that won't work with newer 0.14 releases. (e.g. 0.14.0-beta3)\nAnother lib, react-redux, apparently just straight-up removed the peer dependency.\n. Awesome, the new API looks a lot nicer. Have you done any benchmarks that you could share?\nWould you consider publishing it as 0.5.0-alpha.0 or similar on npm so it's easier to try out?\nHaving an intermediate release that lets you use both APIs would be a really nice touch, it lets you avoid having to convert all your tables at once, which can be annoying.\n. You can use react-overlays (or react-bootstrap if you're using bootstrap styles). They provide an Overlay component. It uses Portal to append a div to the document root and then positions the overlay absolutely. The only problem is that when someone scrolls the overlay stays in the same place...\n.

Deprecating would just be not fare to current user base.\nThese rants about deprecation is just noise and not really helping anyone.. I know this is not ideal but that is reality. Low number of changes and popularity also shows that it is good enough.. ",

As soon as the row starts to becomes visible (top < height), I should add proper aria- and role attributes\n- header: since the header is more predictable than the rows in the DOM, I should be able to manipulate aria- and role attributes more easily\nWhat do you think, apart from the fact that is a veritable hack?

Any chance to see #129 Keyboard / Screen-Reader Accessibility in this release?\n. Guys, any news on accessibility? I was wondering if there are any plans to have it in the near future.\n. Great work! Thanks!\n. Trying to imagine a possible implementation for this feature. Let's start with the API:\nFixedDataTableNew.react.js will have a new prop called colSpanGetter: PropTypes.func\nThe signature of the function will be: function colSpanGetter(rowIndex: number): Array<number> { ... }\nThe convention would be the following: if the function returns an empty array (default), then colSpanGetter is not taken into account; if the return value is an array which is not empty, then the cells will span accordingly.\nLet's see below how the API could look like:\n```\nlet dataSource = [{\n  aa: \"row0-col0\",\n  bb: \"row0-col1\",\n  cc: \"row0-col2\",\n  dd: \"row0-col3\",\n  ee: \"row0-col4\",\n  ff: \"row0-col5\",\n  gg: \"row0-col6\"\n}, {\n  aa: \"row1-col0-1\",\n  cc: \"row1-col2-4\",\n  ff: \"row2-col5-6\"\n}, {\n  aa: \"row2-col0\",\n  bb: \"row2-col1\",\n  cc: \"row2-col2\",\n  dd: \"row2-col3\",\n  ee: \"row2-col4\",\n  ff: \"row2-col5\",\n  gg: \"row2-col6\"\n}];\ngetCellData(rowIndex, colIndex) {\nlet colNames = ['aa', 'bb', 'cc', 'dd', 'ee', 'ff'];\nreturn this.dataSource[props.rowIndex][colNames[colIndex]];\n}\n { if (rowIndex === 1) return [2, 3, 2]}} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 0)})} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 1)})} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 2)})} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 3)})} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 4)})} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 5)})} ... />\n   ({getCellData(props.rowIndex, 6)})} ... />\n\n```\n\nAlso, let's see how the implementation could look like:\n1. Inside the `render()` function of the `FixedDataTableBufferedRows.react.js`, the `colSpan` value could be extracted and passed down all the way to `FixedDataTableCellGroup.react.js` (going through `FixedDataTableBufferedRows.react.js` and `FixedDataTableRow.react.js`)\n2. Inside the `render()` function of the `FixedDataTableCellGroup.react.js`, there will be an if statement that checks `colSpan` parameter:\n\n```\nif(props.colSpan.length === 0) {\n  //keep the same logic as is\n  for (var i = 0, j = columns.length; i < j; i++) {\n    ...\n  }\n} else {\n  let colSpanIndex = 0, cellIndex = 0, columnProps;\n\n  //the number of rendered cells = the number of items inside the colSpan array\n  for (var i = 0, j = props.colSpan.length; i < j; i++) {\n    //cell_0, cell_2, cell_5\n    key = 'cell_' + cellIndex;\n\n    //columns[0], columns[2], columns[5]\n    columnProps = columns[cellIndex].props;\n\n    cells[i] = this._renderCell(\n      columnProps,\n      key,\n      ...\n    )\n\n    //set the next index according to the colSpan value\n    cellIndex += props.colSpan[colSpanIndex++];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n@ehzhang am I too far from what this should look like?\n. @Bazze I gave up the idea since some other things got prioritized. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see this feature in a future release of `FixedDataTable`\n. @westoque check this out http://goo.gl/B4ogaz\n. @AlesJiranek here's an example with a wrapper on top of FixedDataTable that uses Flux https://github.com/cosminnicula/react-ui-components. This extended DataTable provides a few things like lazy loading, multiple selection, column sorting, auto width, percentage column widths, filtering, loading progress, \"no data\" custom message. Careful with the Store, Action Creators and Dispatcher which are all singletons. Just clone the repo and run the following command: `npm install && npm run build && npm run examples`\n.

I am trying to implement one that can handle both for devices with touch screen and mouse. \nMy current direction is to let fixed-data-table deal with mouse scrolling because it's optimization is better, and let zynga-scroller deal with touch by setting the scrollLeft and scrollTop only if there are touch events.\nIdeally fixed data table could respond to scrollLeft/scrollTop prop changes after mount.\n. I think scrollTop can follow the rowToScrollTo model... but the current implementation is a bit old.\nIf the initial property specified scrollTop and rowToScrollTo, the current code would first calculate scrollY based on scrollTop, then immediately recalculate scrollY based on rowToScrollTo, the scrollTop calculation in this case is totally unnecessary.\n. Should've branched before committing.\nI'll create a different PR.\n. @jasongonzales23 No, this wasn't merged. You can check out my fork on how I implemented it. It's actually fairly straightforward. \n. This is already outdated. Not sure when I'll have to time to work on this though.\n. not sure if it is still relevant.... ",

When I do some manipulations on the page(other than the dataGrid) and I trigger the Ajax call due to a form submit to reload the dataGrid with new data, the grid doesn't reload with the new data. .

Checking if anyone has had time to look at the fiddle.  This is something we need to work.  I don't know if I'm going about it incorrectly, if this can't be done because of performance, or if this is an actual bug.  I know this is a big project, but soon we'll have evaluate different data tables and consider switching.  Any help would be great.\n. I have not found a way around this.  Was hoping to get some sort of confirmation that this was an issue and not something I was doing wrong.  For now I am settling but was hoping this would be fixed in a future release.  I think there is another issue or pull request that deals with this same issue, but I'm on mobile and can't link to it.  Would like a project status to see the chances of an official fix, but no luck yet.  Sorry I don't have better news.\n. I have the same question as johannessjoberg.  I have submitted a few issues with JSFiddles and I haven't even heard if what I found is a bug or if I'm doing something the wrong way.  I understand the devs are very busy, and I appreciate all of Facebook's work on this but I'd like to know if this is something that will continue to evolve and be supported.\n. Does anyone here have experience with FlexTable from react-virtualized?  I have been holding off trying it because this project has worked well, and I've been hoping that we'd get some sort of answer as to the future of this project.  This issue alone is 1 month old and we haven't heard anything as to whether or not this project is abandoned. \n. @rbalicki2 - the fiddles I had were not for this issue.  I was mentioning the fiddles to show that it should have been easy for someone to look at an issue and say yes this is an issue or no you are doing it wrong.\nIn case you are still interested, the fiddles are in this issue - https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/issues/326\n. I'm looking for one that supports resizable columns and fixed header.  I also really like the virtual rows.\n. The way we did it was in the method that creates cells.  We only have a quick prototype currently that I need to clean up.  The gist is that when we render the first cell of the last row, we kick off a request to get more rows.  You need to take into account rendering that cell multiple times and if that cell is visible without scrolling - meaning if you only have like 5 rows you will kick off another request for an empty page.\n. Sorry, but I don't know enough about scrolling and how the table handles it to say.\n. One issue with this could be variable row heights.\n. I think it is mandatory, but I could be wrong.  I am now in need of a new infinity scrolling solution since I was updating state in a render method.  Redux is complaining about this.\n. Will this include any issue fixes or merges from other PR's?\n. Is there any update on this?\n. I am interetested in this as well.  This seems to be a similar discussion - https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/issues/322 - but it doesn't have any answers yet.\n. I'm curious about this as well.

Trying to figure this out because without this functionality, we'll have to use a different data grid.\n```\n  var Table = FixedDataTable.Table,\n      Column = FixedDataTable.Column,\n      Cell = FixedDataTable.Cell \n      rows = [\n        {\n          items: [ \n            'apple',\n            'orange'\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          items: [ \n            'dog',\n            'cat'\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          items: [ \n            'xbox',\n            'playstation'\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          items: [ \n            'computer',\n            'phone'\n          ]\n        }\n    ];\nvar Column1 = React.createElement(Column, {\n    width: 250,\n    header: 'Items',\n    columnKey: 'items',\n    cell: function (_ref) {\n      var rowIndex = _ref.rowIndex;\n      var width = _ref.width;\n      var height = _ref.height;\n      var columnKey = _ref.columnKey;\n      var items = rows[rowIndex][columnKey];\n      var li = [];\n\n      var i = 0;\n      for( i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n        li.push( React.createElement(\n          \"li\",\n          {\n            key: items[i]   // not guaranteed to be unique - just for testing\n          },\n          items[i]\n        ));\n      }\n\n      var ol =  React.createElement(\n          \"ol\",\n          null,\n          li\n        );\n\n      return React.createElement( Cell, {\n          width: width,\n          height: height,\n          className: \"my-class\" \n        },\n        ol\n      );\n    } \n  });\n\nvar ResizeTable = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'ResizeTable',\n  render: function () {\n    var oThis = this;\n    var MyTable = React.createElement(Table, {\n        height: 350,\n        width: 250,\n        rowsCount: rows.length,\n        rowHeight: 50,\n        rowHeightGetter: function rowHeightGetter(index) {\n          var nHeight = 50,\n          oRow = rows[index];\n\n          nHeight += ( oRow.items.length - 1 ) * 15;\n\n          return nHeight;\n        },\n        headerHeight: 40,\n        onRowClick: function(e, index) {\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 1' );\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 2' );\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 3' );\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 4' );\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 5' );\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 6' );\n          rows[index].items.push( 'new item 7' );\n\n          redoTable();\n        }\n      },\n      Column1\n    );\n\n    return React.createElement(\n      'div',\n      null,\n      'My table:',\n      MyTable\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nfunction redoTable() {\n  ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(\n    ResizeTable\n  ), document.getElementById('ResizeTable'));\n}\n\nredoTable();\n\n```\n. Checking if anyone has had time to look at the fiddle.  This is something we need to work.  I don't know if I'm going about it incorrectly, if this can't be done because of performance, or if this is an actual bug.  I know this is a big project, but soon we'll have evaluate different data tables and consider switching.  Any help would be great.\n. I have not found a way around this.  Was hoping to get some sort of confirmation that this was an issue and not something I was doing wrong.  For now I am settling but was hoping this would be fixed in a future release.  I think there is another issue or pull request that deals with this same issue, but I'm on mobile and can't link to it.  Would like a project status to see the chances of an official fix, but no luck yet.  Sorry I don't have better news.\n. I have the same question as johannessjoberg.  I have submitted a few issues with JSFiddles and I haven't even heard if what I found is a bug or if I'm doing something the wrong way.  I understand the devs are very busy, and I appreciate all of Facebook's work on this but I'd like to know if this is something that will continue to evolve and be supported.\n. Does anyone here have experience with FlexTable from react-virtualized?  I have been holding off trying it because this project has worked well, and I've been hoping that we'd get some sort of answer as to the future of this project.  This issue alone is 1 month old and we haven't heard anything as to whether or not this project is abandoned. \n. @rbalicki2 - the fiddles I had were not for this issue.  I was mentioning the fiddles to show that it should have been easy for someone to look at an issue and say yes this is an issue or no you are doing it wrong.\nIn case you are still interested, the fiddles are in this issue - https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/issues/326\n. I'm looking for one that supports resizable columns and fixed header.  I also really like the virtual rows.\n. The way we did it was in the method that creates cells.  We only have a quick prototype currently that I need to clean up.  The gist is that when we render the first cell of the last row, we kick off a request to get more rows.  You need to take into account rendering that cell multiple times and if that cell is visible without scrolling - meaning if you only have like 5 rows you will kick off another request for an empty page.\n. Sorry, but I don't know enough about scrolling and how the table handles it to say.\n. One issue with this could be variable row heights.\n. I think it is mandatory, but I could be wrong.  I am now in need of a new infinity scrolling solution since I was updating state in a render method.  Redux is complaining about this.\n. Will this include any issue fixes or merges from other PR's?\n. ",

It would be interesting to see if anyone has experience with a pop-up type cell to display - for example to show a button that displays pop-up content larger than the cell filled with content from an async call.\n.
