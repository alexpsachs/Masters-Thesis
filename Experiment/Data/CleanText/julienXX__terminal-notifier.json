    "alloy": "Unfortunately not, notifications always use the icon of the app that sends them. The only way to do it is by including your own build of the notifier with the icon replaced by yours.\n. No. Notification center always uses the app\u2019s icon, there is no way to specify another image.\n. It\u2019s not a matter of code, it\u2019s not possible. At all.\n. That\u2019s currently not implemented, but I agree that it should be.\n. Now you can just download the new version ;) Thanks for the feedback!\n. @bakman2 I\u2019m not sure I follow. If the binary would be damaged/incomplete, then you wouldn't be able to send a notification in the first place. Does it only not work with the -open option?\n. Hmm, well, that command works for me.\n@freels Does it work for you?\n\n(do the prebuilt binaries already contain the -open changes ?)\n\nYes, it was introduced in 1.2.0.\n. @bakman2 Sorry, that\u2019s what I meant ;) Clicking the notification opens google.com.\n. Btw, what I meant earlier is if it does work without -open, but with, for instance, -activate instead.\n. Good to know. Thanks!\n. I agree it would be great, however, as written in the README:\n\nThe Notification Center always uses the application\u2019s own icon, there\u2019s currently no way to specify a custom icon for a notification. The only way to use this tool with your own icon is to include a build of terminal-notifier with your icon instead.\n. From reading up on this problem, it seems that the above AppleScript will launch the app and since this is to be used as a shell tool, it exits with 1 when launched with insufficient options.\n\nOthers have run into this as well and the solution seems to be to ask the Finder:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to set targetAppPath to (application file id \"nl.superalloy.oss.terminal-notifier\") as string'\nMain:Users:eloy:Code:Objective-C:Terminal Notifier:DerivedData:Terminal Notifier:Build:Products:Debug:terminal-notifier.app\nTo conclude, there isn\u2019t really anything to fix here, if I understand it correctly. (I have no AppleScript experience.)\n. You mean something like?\n$ terminal-notifier -remove GROUP\n. Done.\n. Nice! And thanks for your kind words :)\n. > your tool is amazing and the progress is stunning! You already replaced growlnotify for me and with the -activate key, I have build some nice recursive messages ;-)\nAwesome :)\n\nNow to the question: \nis it technically possible to check or probe, if a notification of a given group is currently displayed?\n\nYup, definitely possible. The app has access to all notifications it has sent and are still listed.\nI\u2019m thinking something like -list GROUP, which could then also take -list ALL, and return a line of tab delimited values for the notification(s).\nWill you work on a patch for this?\n. Hah. Awesome! :)\n. Thanks for your work!\n. You don\u2019t need to sign the app when running it in development and you don\u2019t need to ever sign if you enable that in the GateKeeper preferences.\nSo, please send a pull-request :)\n. Great, thanks!\n. How would you feel about something like a tab separated list? It won't always be pretty, but it will be easier to parse and I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s almost always going to be the goal.\n. I cleaned the output a bit more, to make it even more parseable. (E.g. no output when there's nothing to list.)\nHope this works for you.\n. This seems to be a problem with the default NSUserDefaults option parsing a Cocoa app has. I can trigger it by starting the message with either [ or (. It\u2019s even worse with {.\nI\u2019ll have to mull this over a bit, but I\u2019ll probably have to end up ditching the default option parsing and use getopt :(\n. This has been fixed as described by my comment on #36, which uses @renard\u2019s suggestion.\n. Thanks, but this is already shown in the README:\n\nThe Notification Center always uses the application\u2019s own icon, there\u2019s currently no way to specify a custom icon for a notification. The only way to use this tool with your own icon is to include a build of terminal-notifier with your icon instead.\n. Sorry for the long delay. I have pulled in your patch. Thanks!\n. Awww damn, I thought I had tested that. Thanks!\n. Hmm, it seems to work for me on 1.9.3-p194. Which version are you on?\n. You\u2019re completely right. Thanks!\n. Released as 1.4.2\n. Afaik it's not possible, which I can imagine Apple doing as it would probably become ugly very fast :)\n\nYou could experiment with specifying a NSAttributedString instead of a NSString as the message and adding color to it.\n. Sorry for taking so long. Thanks for the suggestions, but this feels too brittle to me.\nIt\u2019s probably good to notice that you can use all unicode characters, including emoji. E.g.\n\n. Unfortunately that\u2019s not possible, it uses the name of the application that sent the notification. Like @AidanTale said, the only way to change this is to change the app name, which I didn\u2019t do because I wanted a terminal friendly app name without spaces.\n. Thanks for the info! I\u2019ll add this to the next release.\n. Awesome!\nHowever, I wonder if it might not be a better idea to move your bindings into this repo as well. I would give you repo access of course and you are free to work on the tool itself as well. That way we can better synchronise releases.\n. Although running your travis tests might be an issue\u2026\n. Closing this until further notice.\n. Indeed. Alas, like with the icon, the only way to do this in a supported way is to create a build specifically for your goal, in this case by changing the app name to \u2018geektool\u2019.\n. Yeah I should add one. In the meantime, there are many articles all over the web that explain it in more detail, for instance: http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/03/send-an-alert-to-notification-center-from-the-command-line-in-os-x/.\n. I\u2019ve added a few examples to the REAME. Thanks.\n. I think this should actually be fixed in the libs that use this tool, by checking the available? method and not perform any unnecessary work at all.\nHaving said that, I see that that isn\u2019t going to be done all the time and raising gets annoying, so I\u2019ll merge it anyways :) Thanks.\n. This has since been fixed. Thanks.\n. Hah. Also: http://rubygems.org/gems/terminal-notifier. Most people prefer simplicity of installation over a tiny bit more speed :)\n. As described in #3, the solution might be to re-download it. Not sure why it happens, though.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the reports and sorry for taking so long, I hope this adequately fixes the problem.\n. Unfortunately not. From the README:\n\nThe Notification Center always uses the application\u2019s own icon, there\u2019s\ncurrently no way to specify a custom icon for a notification. The only way to\nuse this tool with your own icon is to include a build of terminal-notifier\nwith your icon instead.\n. Lucky coincidence :)\n\nOne thing you can do is use Unicode emojis, if there is one that matches your wish.\n. No, there\u2019s currently no option for this.\n. There does not appear to be a sanctioned API for this, in case anyone finds a solution let me know.\n. @cdenneen Are you saying that this can be done through the APIs? If so, please let us know or submit a patch.\n. It has been fixed as described by my comment in #36.\n. This is (unfortunately) the default notification center behaviour and there is no standard way to control this. If anyone figures out a hack, please send a patch!\n. I ended up changing this a bit by escaping/unescaping the first character is necessary. It\u2019s a bit annoying, but it makes the CLI interface consistent between the Ruby and the straight bin versions.\nSorry for the long delay. Thanks!\n. Sorry for the long delay, thanks!\n. After thinking about it some more, I have to agree with @ipwnstuff. Trying to run on an unsupported platform is simply an error and should be made clear.\n@mgrosso Can you take it up with the author of the lib you mean? (Which is it btw?) This won\u2019t be released in the next few days, so there should be time for them to fix it.\n. It shouldn\u2019t fail and complain on your system, not sure yet why it doesn't.\nBut in any case, as stated in the README, you need OS X 10.8 or higher.\n. > Oh, come on :P Program should not segfault in any circumstances. If it does - it is a bug.\nYeah that\u2019s what I meant, it shouldn\u2019t fail like that but should complain instead.\nThe check in the Ruby code should have guarded against it, but maybe it\u2019s a Ruby 1.8.6 (which iirc comes with 10.7) difference. A patch for that would be great.\n. Yeah I think I also did it for clarity sake, but looking at the diff it\u2019s really minimal.\nSorry for the long delay. Thanks!\n. Oooh, interesting, I\u2019ll have a play with this over the next few days. Thanks!\n. I have separated faking the sender into a -sender ID option.\nSorry for the long delay. Thanks!\n. That\u2019s what I assumed at the time, but it might be wrong. Just remove the code-sign setting for the release configuration and see if it works :)\n. If you had previously run the app with the original icon in place, then the system will have cached the icon and I have no idea how to flush that. The simplest way to trigger the new icon to be picked up is by changing the \u2018bundle ID\u2019 of the app.\n. I\u2019m definitely open to patches for this. For now I\u2019m closing this until further notice.\n. Sorry for the long delay. Thanks!\n. Wow, that\u2019s some nice investigative work :+1:\nThe notification center stuff is very much bound to Launch Services, so I can easily see that getting messed up when the Info.plist changes.\nAt least it\u2019s nice to have a ticket that people can find to help them out in case they run into the same issue. Thanks :)\n. Thanks for the suggestion, but this is beyond the scope of this project. If anyone makes a patch I would love to see it and discuss wether or not it actually is beyond the scope, though.\n. This works for me and seems to be more of a launch services issue on your machine.\n. Yeah this definitely is a weird one. It seems to hit only a few, but it hits them continuously. I hope the new version randomly fixes it for you.\n. Hi, I did not include this in the 1.5.0 release yet, because:\n- it replicates the piped data reading that is in the actual binary now\n- I\u2019m not a big fan of having the user copy scripts\nRegarding the latter, how are you using this? If you\u2019re using Homebrew, they already wrap it in a script.\n. Fair enough. If you could update the script and add a note about how the user is supposed to install it to the README, then we can merge this.\n. Thanks. It seems something in the xcodeproj itself is leading to the assertion being hit:\nASSERTION FAILURE in /SourceCache/DVTFoundation/DVTFoundation-2091/Framework/Classes/XML/DVTXMLUnarchiver.m:452\nDetails:  Assertion failed: strcmp((const char *)xmlTextReaderConstName(xmlReader), elementNameCopy) == 0\nObject:   <DVTXMLUnarchiver: 0x403615d40>\nMethod:   -decodeElementNodeWithXMLTextReader:owner:container:parsingState:success:error:\nThread:   <NSThread: 0x400409ba0>{name = (null), num = 1}\nHints:   None\n. So it was not the xcodeproj, but the scheme which had proper XML entities for, in this case, emoji characters used in arguments to the command-line. This is definitely a 10.9 bug, it would be great if you can update your radar ticket with this deduction/a crashing sample project.\nThanks again! For now you should be able to install through homebrew with the --HEAD option.\n. @julienXX This fix should already warrant a 1.5.1 release, in case you want to push the gemspec with license asap.\n. @julienXX Awesome, thanks! Can you also send a PR for the homebrew formula?\n. <3\n. This is expected and should be better reflected in the docs. When you use -sender it fakes as if the notification was sent by a specific application, when clicking the notification this other application will be launched instead. As such, the terminal-notifier application does not get activated and not get a chance to run -execute commands.\n. @erkalicious It\u2019s not clear to me if you\u2019re saying that it works this way with both sender and activate, in the case of sender there is nothing we can do about it, if it\u2019s activate then it might be possible and I agree that in this case we should try to maximise.\n. This should probably be on-demand-driven instead, otherwise it\u2019s, like @julienXX says, rather difficult. So if you have use-cases, please share.\n@Alvaroctal what is the use-case you have in mind and how would you like it to work for your case?\n. That's awesome. Didn't know Apple had fixed that, I don't think they updated my radar mentioned in the README.\n.  @julienXX I\u2019m starting to think that this might be a codesign issue. Do you have a Apple Mac dev account?\nTo others, if you have a Mac dev account, please try if signing the app fixes things.\n. @rkh Yeah, because -sender in effect fakes Launch Services to believe it actually originated from that app, which is why I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s a code-sign/entitlements issue.\n. At least one report of someone who knows it has gotten stricter: http://twitter.com/zwaldowski/status/398116050669408256\n. @julienXX Atm the 10.9 API docs still have to be downloaded from developer.apple.com. Here\u2019s the summary of changes introduced in 10.9:\n\nNSUserNotification\nCalling -removeDeliveredNotification: and -removeAllDeliveredNotifications: will now remove notifications that are displayed.\nA new property on NSUserNotification, -identifier, can be used to uniquely identify an individual notification even across separate launches of an application. If a notification is delivered with the same identifier as an existing notification, it will replace the preexisting notification. This can be used to update existing notifications.\nNSUserNotification has a new property to specify the image shown in the content of a notification.\nNSUserNotification allows for a \u2018quick reply.\u2019 The property responsePlaceholder can be used to set a placeholder string and the response can be retrieved from the response property.\n. Yeah the first one is probably best. For instance, this means that something like a testing framework can set its own \u2018app\u2019 icon and use the content image for a \u2018passing\u2019 vs \u2018failing\u2019 icon.\n. I\u2019m not aware of an existing wrapper. I think it sounds like a good idea, that is, if we can cover all of its options?\n\nWill you be looking into creating a patch for this?\n. As just updated in the README, using both -sender and -execute together won\u2019t work.\nRegarding the error message, have you turned of the Gate Keeper system in your System Preference -> Security ?\n/cc @julienXX Might be time to sign these builds again.\n. @rkh But do you still really need to use the -sender option?\n. Thanks for the feedback, but I agree with @liyicky that it\u2019s not that bad, especially as the command prints the help banner and shows you which are required.\n. Those changes make the difference. Thanks for taking the time!\n. Please do not change consistent whitespace when contributing patches. It makes it hard to see where your actual changes are and it\u2019s your style taste, not mine. Please remove the indentation changes altogether and I\u2019m :+1: on this.\n. The same applies to curly braces in if/else clauses, please follow the existing source and place them on the same line.\n. @julienXX The original code was written with the idea that the app would always exit asap after delivery. I see that nowadays there\u2019s the possibility for the app to remain running when waitForResponse is set and then checks if the notification is still present.\nI don\u2019t know how long it can remain \u2018present\u2019 nor have I done anything else than skim through the source, but it does look like that might be the source of the leak, as it continuously generates autoreleased strings which will never get released (until the app exits). I suggest you create the string with hash once outside of the while loop and keep an eye on other objects being created in situations where the app might be running for a long time.. @julienXX If you have any questions or want to pair, let me know.. @julienXX Without having looked into it at all, I\u2019m wondering if this might be related to that loop that polls for the existence of notifications (where we recently fixed a memory issue)?. \ud83d\udc4d . It\u2019s very kind of you to say so, thanks! :pray:. ",

I can't think of anything else that could break this.\nWait, hang on.\nsh-3.2# terminal-notifier -message hi\n* Notification delivered.\nWell now. I'm beginning to think this may have something to do with this. Are you running these in a regular terminal window or over ssh or in tmux or something? The script not working makes sense if it's run outside of the user namespace.\n. Happy to help! I still think terminal-notifier should detect and bail out when it comes up against this wall, even if it can't get around it. Hanging makes me sad.\n. ",

My bash script which is called by launchd is started as user 'root' and this user doesn't have running NotificationCenter ever.\nThe easiest thing (\"workaround\") is to remove notification at all because condition is false forever. Unfortunatelly this is not solution, becasue the main goal is to notify user (terminal-notifier was try to replace growl which is working in this case).\n. Nevertheless you brought me to this thought:\nps aux | grep NotificationCenter | grep -v grep | cut -d' ' -f1 | \\\nwhile read JUZR; do\n        su - \"$JUZR\" -c \"terminal-notifier -message \\\"$1\\\"\"\ndone\nBecause I need to tell it to anyone who is logged (a broadcast message :-)).

Does it work for you also?\n. Your issue is that terminal-notifier sends the message to the NotificationCenter of the current user, and root is not logged in with the graphical UI ever. I dont have the issue because I use a user specific launchd.\nYou could play with sudo so that the root user impersonates your user when sending the notification, that might work. Still check for the given user having a NotificationCenter process, otherwise the script will hang.\nSomething like this should send a notification to the given user if logged in, otherwise skip the notification. I typed this without testing it, so you might have to doublecheck/debug, but you get the idea.\ntargetUser=kmarty\nif [ -n \"$(pgrep -u $targetUser NotificationCenter)\" ]; then\n  sudo -u $targetUser terminal-notifier -message \"$*\"\nfi\n.

Thanks for pointing that out.\n. Closing for now. Feel free to reopen when you have some instructions on how the user is supposed to install it.\n. Thanks for pointing that out. That's a great idea to remind everyone of this issue.\nThe MIT license is now specified in the gemspec.\n. Unfortunately not. From the README:\n```\nThe Notification Center always uses the application\u2019s own icon, there\u2019s currently\nno way to specify a custom icon for a notification. The only way to use this tool\nwith your own icon is to use the -sender option or include a build of terminal-notifier\nwith your icon and bundle identifier instead.\nHowever, you can use unicode symbols and emojis.\n```\n. @alloy I pushed version 1.5.1 to Rubygems.\n. @alloy done!\n. Unfortunately you have to escape starting non-alphanumerical characters. \nDuplicate of #11, see fix as described in #36.\nRegarding your over ssh issue, perhaps this https://gist.github.com/dyoder/4220996 helps?\n. Done, thanks!\n. Sorry I'm not under 10.9 yet, will get back back as soon as I have my hands on it.\n. Looking into this.\n. Looking into this.\n. Seems to be the default OSX behaviour, if you miniaturize an app, option-tab to this app doesn't maximize it.\n. @jamsyoung it may be a code signing issue (see #63)\n. So far I haven't seen anything in the API that would allow us to use these options :(\n. @jeremymatthews displaying an action button is kinda trivial but handling a whole lot of different actions from the command-line seems difficult.\n. @danielbayley that's a good idea, I'll look if it's feasible.\n. Interesting. @vjeantet would you be interested in submitting a PR to terminal-notifier instead of maintaining a fork?\n. Hey all, @vjeantet work has been merged in 1.7.0 release so I'll close this issue.\n. @anutron you should see some logs in Console.app system logs. A temporary fix is to specify a sender (as mentioned in #60).\n$ terminal-notifier -title foo -message bar -sender com.apple.Terminal\n. @alloy unfortunately not.\n. @anutron @alloy @rkh seems to me that it's working again since the 1.9.1 OSX update (at least on both my computers). Can anyone confirm?\n. Looks like it's not available in the API yet. Looking into it.\n. @alloy oh cool! I relied on the online docs that are indeed outdated.\n. -appIcon & -contentImage options are now available.\n. @WillyWinkel Yes, that's how Apple designed it regarding the small terminal icon. The only way to have it disappear is to make a custom build with no default icon.. @benb116 @staticfloat it's working for me in both cases when passing the -sender for the creation & the removal without any new empty notification.\nAre you both on the latest version (1.5.1)? How did you install it (home-brew, ruby gem...)?\n. @staticfloat when I execute\n$ terminal-notifier -title foo -message bar -sender com.apple.iWork.Keynote\nand\n$ ( terminal-notifier -sender com.apple.iWork.Keynote -remove \"ALL\" )\nit works if that can help. I'm on Mavericks.\n. @staticfloat a workaround may be:\n$ { terminal-notifier -sender com.apple.iWork.Keynote -remove \"ALL\" & }\n. @staticfloat I don't see this issue with the latest 1.8.0. Can you confirm whether it's working or not for you?. Closing since there was no activity on this. Feel free to re-open if needed.. Closing for now.\n. Works well on my machine with any app. I don't have Outlook to check.\nDo you run the latest terminal-notifier version (1.5.1)? Do you have a com.microsoft.Outlook.plist file in ~/Library/Preferences?\n. Running /Applications/terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier -title foo -message bar -sender com.apple.Safariworks for you?\n. @doovers not sure I understand what you mean by sender functionality, sender does nothing but \"simulating\" the app that created the notification. Perhaps you're looking for the -activate option?\n. Closing for now. Feel free to re-opne if the issue persist with the 1.6.0 release.\n. @nordanfors The correct syntax is -open \"file:///Users/nordanfors/foo.txt\" for example.\nDoes it solve your issue?\n. What are your OSX & terminal-notifier versions? How did you install terminal-notifier?\n. @tubbo tried it in tmux, works for me.\n. @adagios It's really weird, nothing has been commited recently. How did you install it (homebrew, gem, npm)?\n. @adagios @tubbo @lieut-data does issue persist with the 1.6.0 release?\n. @xufi I don't think your issue is related, can you see something like @tubbo gets in your logs?\n. Closing for now, feel free to reopen if you encounter the issue again.\n. @hanakin could you try to remove the version installed by gulp and try again with a fresh one installed via homebrew? Maybe this gulp-notify thing is messing something.\n. Yes the \"-sender\" option seems to be mandatory under Mavericks but we have to dig a bit deeper to be a 100% sure and update the doc accordingly.\n. Closing the issue, please see #63 \n. Thanks a lot! I'll look more deeply at your PR a bit later.\n@kalikkalik @jeremymatthews could it be possible to separate the commits into what really changed and your changes in indentation?\n. Thanks a lot @jeremymatthews!\nI'll try to push a new version tonight.\n. Thanks @kennydude very nice addition!\nI'm a bit concerned about the override that may prevent AppStore submissions in some ways.\nWhat's your take on this @alloy ?\n. I'll update the README with @jeremymatthews comment and release a new version a bit later. Thanks again @kennydude !\n. One way to do it with Safari:\n- create a shell script with:\nosascript -e '\n    tell application \"Safari\"\n      activate\n      do JavaScript \"history.go(0)\" in document 1\n    end tell\n'\n- make it executable\n- run terminal-notifier -message \"foo\" -execute \"sh /path/to/your_script.sh\"\nYou should then adapt the AppleScript to your browser of choice or make different scripts for different browsers (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2091235/mac-reloading-document-in-chrome-or-firefox).\n. Thanks @jonasrauber !\n. @xufi Could you be more specific? How did you install it? What is the desired outcome? I don't use iterm2 myself so I'm no aware of what integration you should get.\n. Ok closing for now. Feel free to re-open if you have more details.\n. @fitzgen Can you try with a longer id like 123 or abc? It fails for me with a one char id but works with longer ones.\n. @fitzgen can you try to update terminal-notifier to 1.6.0 (brew update && brew upgrade terminal-notifier) and see if the issue persist?\n. Sorry to ask again but if you change your group from a to aa?\n. Closing for now, feel free to reopen if you encounter the issue again.\n. Closing this issue for now as I don't think I'll fix. Don't hesitate to re-open if you really have a need for this behaviour.. This should work:\nshell\n$ VARIABLE=`ls /tmp`\n$ terminal-notifier -message \"List: $VARIABLE\"\n. @ceilingcat Here's how to use it:\nterminal-notifier -message foo -contentImage ~/Dropbox/Pictures/image.jpg\nor\nterminal-notifier -message foo -appIcon ~/Dropbox/Pictures/image.jpg\nPlease note that you must use OSX 10.9 for these options to work.\n. @paracycle sorry a bit overwhelmed these days, I'll have a look real soon :)\n. Thanks @paracycle!\n. You've got the -activate, -open or -execute options that can trigger something when the user clicks the notification. Or perhaps you mean something else?\n. @charles-l in 1.7.1 release you can have a json output of the event.\n. @nbrownus It's working on my 1.9.3 machine with terminal-notifier 1.6.0. Could you please show me the exact command you are typing?\n. @nbrownus URLs are supported in the upcoming version but I wait to have more features to release a new gem. Perhaps I should update the Readme in the meantime.\n. Sorry no 10.10 for me to test on, it's too early but thanks for taking the time to check if it runs :)\n(also I don't maintain node-notify)\n. @patrickkettner It's not too early, can you open a new issue please?\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. @jxpx777 Maybe this week, I'll release a new version once I'll have merged the remaining PRs.\n. Sorry it's not possible to have per notification stickiness at the moment (see #33) but you can set it for all notifications in System Preferences.\n. Sorry it's not possible at the moment.\n. What do you mean by \"Using the unescaped url doesn't have the intended effect either: -open https://example.com/https://example.com opens https://example.com/https://example.com\"?\nWhat would you expect it to open?\n. Fixed in 1.8.0.. Merged, thanks a lot!\n. @henry0312 Sorry, I'm a bit overwhelmed ATM, I'll take a look ASAP.\n. Merged, thanks a lot!\n. V1.5.1 is outdated so seems your homebrew Formulas, please run:\nbrew update && brew install terminal-notifier\nAnd you should get the latest version.\n. What would this interval option do? Prevent new notifications until interval is reached?\n. Yeah I think it's better too. This seems really too specific to belong to terminal-notifier. Closing the issue for now, feel free to re-open it if you really want to discuss this option.\n. Hello @SteveNewhouse I just pushed 1.6.1 with bug fixes and basic 10.10 compatibility.\n. Sorry for the delay. I think the issue is fixed with #113 which has been merged.\n. Seems not possible but looking into this.\n. Closing the issue, feel free to re-open if the problem still occurs.. Agreed, I'll check if there is an API to check \"Do Not Disturb\" status.\n. Found a _ignoresDoNotDisturb property that I can use (remember for myself).\n. Option is now merged, will be out in the upcoming release.. @jamesmortensen sorry I misread your second comment and thought you found that your issue wasn't related to terminal-notifier.\n. @jamesmortensen ok great, thanks for the clarification. I think that it would be better to split in two issues so we can track the eventual progress on it better.\n. @patrickkettner Which version are you running? Did you install it via homebrew or via gem?\n. no worries :)\nYou're on 10.10 latest beta?\n. If you open Console.app do you see anything related to terminal-notifier when trying to send a notification?\n. Ok I'll try it later when I'll get back home (no 10.10 at work).\n. Ok it works on my 10.10 machine. Your Notification Center isn't in \"do no disturb\" mode?\n. Apparently yes https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/issues/104\n. On 1.6.1 too\n. @carldavis @jeffbyrnes @brandonblack @patrickkettner @albinoz I'll try to give you a custom build to try in the next few days if you have some time to test it.\n. @smackesey @patrickkettner @Apsu could one of you open a new issue regarding the tux stuff so that we can all track better the progress? Thanks.\n. @patrickkettner do you mean that when you opened the issue originally you were using terminal-notifier from tmux?\n. Closing this issue, please see #115 for tmux users.\nIf someone still can't run 1.6.1 under Yosemite and isn't using tmux, please open a new issue as this one has become difficult to manage.\n. Hi @geebru, you could use UNIX pipes something like:\ncommand | grep error | terminal-notifier -message\nTell me if it fits your workflow.\n. Then you should try to play with iTerm Triggers parameters (see \\0...\\9 here http://iterm2.com/triggers.html#/section/home), it seems you could get what you want your message to be with these.\n. Hi, I'm looking in the API to see if it's possible.\n. Looks like it's possible. I may just disable it since having a new option just for the border doesn't seem to add a lot of value ;)\n. Removing the terminal icon seems not possible as far as I can see.\n. @alexgorbatchev isn't it that your app has no icon?\n. Border is removed! (https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/commit/3c0d7312c1e54cbdc309988c5f42c35b33807bb5).\nYou'll have to wait for the next release to enjoy it :)\n. @ricardobeat sure, expect a new version soon.\n. @marszall87 yes see #131 answers.\n. I don't really get the use-case. Do you have something specific in mind?\n. @127001 you could switch terminal-notifier notification style in System Preferences http://cl.ly/image/1X1h0y1j1G0T to get this behaviour.\n. You now have this feature in terminal-notifier 1.7.0 :)\n. Sorry I'm not using gulp-notify. If you have more info perhaps I can narrow where the issue comes from.\n. @cmosguy terminal-notifier is OS X only, how did you install ruby on your windows box?\n. All right, if you intend to have notifications in a windows environment, you'll have better luck with Growl I guess.\n. @mariusk You could use standard UNIX tools for the filter part like\n$ command | grep word | terminal-notifier -message\n. Thanks a lot!\n. Please see eventual followup on this issue here #115 \n. As I said in #106 unfortunately I'm not a tmux user so if someone finds a solution please post it here. My guess is that the issue may lie in reattach-to-user-namespace and yosemite.\n. @bessarabov try a brew upgrade after brew update.\n. Closing the issue, feel free to re-open if there is something I can help with.. Oh thanks for pointing that out. I'll just remove it for now until I upload a working version.\n. I can't see this behaviour. Are you using 1.6.2?\n. Closing for now, feel free to re-open if you still have issues.. You can do something like:\n$ terminal-notifier -message \"test\" -execute \"say Test && say lol\"\n. That would be nice but I can't see any generic way to have it. Have a look at #62 for more on this topic.\n. Please see #115 which is already opened regarding terminal-notifier and tmux.\nI'm not a tmux user but other users found some way to workaround the issue.\n. Could just something like sleep 5 && terminal-notifier -message \"delayed message\" do what you need?\n. Does the notification appear at least?\n. Anything in Console.app that could be related?\n. No problem, glad it solved itself :)\n. Still not possible see https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/issues/35.\n. Sorry it's not possible to have per notification stickiness at the moment (see #33) but you can set it for all notifications in System Preferences.\n. Thanks!\n. Oh cool thanks! I'll check it very soon, could you just remove the Gemfile.lock update from your your PR?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for bringing this up. Unfortunately I don't have access to the betas ATM but I hope it will be okay when it's released. Can you see something in Console.app?\n. It's the intended behavior.\n. Unfortunately I didn't found a way to suppress it so far. You still can make yourself a custom build with a transparent icon I guess.\n. Also if you make a custom build with a new icon, you have to run:\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\; to clear the cache.\n. @Max-108 you have to download the source code update and re-compile it with your new icon.\n. Thanks @vitorgalvao! Do you mind if I reference your script in the README?\n. @Max-108 thanks are always welcomed :)\n. @reubano Excellent, thanks!\n. Please see #115 which provides various solutions to this issue.\n. Thanks for bringing this up. Looking into it to see what can be done.\n. Works for title but there are many options starting with the same letter. Not sure it would add value to have it enabled only for some options and not others.\n. You can do:\nterminal-notifier -remove 123 > /dev/null\nDoes that solve your issue?\n. Which version do you have and how did you install it (home-brew, gem...)? Also you don't need to use sudo to use terminal-notifier.\n. What I see from your screenshot is just that using sudo asks for your password as it should. Try without the sudo.\n. Does this behavior persist upon reboot?\n. Chmod 777 is never a good idea ;)\nCould you try to remove and re-install terminal-notifier?\n. @ThreeState @sroberts could you try to get a sample of the process from the OSX Activity Monitor? Maybe I can find something there.\n. Merged it manually. Thanks.\n. That's really weird. Have you noticed other issues not related to your usage with irssi?\n. Is it possible that you installed the gem version sudo like sudo gem install terminal-notifier?\n. @ramiroaraujo can you please tell me:\n- your OS version\n- terminal-notifier version\n- how you installed it? (home-brew, gem...)\n. @ramiroaraujo what happens if you try terminal-notifier -message test -execute \"open /Applications/Safari.app\" ?\n. I'm not sure what your issue is here. Could you paste the different commands you're trying and their results?\n. Looks like at is somewhat disabled on OSX, that must be the issue here.\n. I think your user is not logged in with graphical shell when doing a su therefore you're not able to access the Notification Center.\n. Closing the issue, feel free to re-open if needed.. I'm not an iTerm user so I won't be able to help here. Sorry.\n. I'll leave it opened in case someone has an answer.\n. Closing the issue, feel free to re-open if needed.. My guess is that when using launchd, you don't get access to the graphical part of the user's account and therefore can't access the Notification Center.\n. @applebit924 nice, could you post your solution here?\n. Thanks :thumbsup: \n. There is no API that would allow me to do that. Closing the issue.. You can now do this with 1.7.1 when using -timeout option and setting your notification as Alert type.\n. Thanks!\n. Please see #131 \n. You will find the executable in /usr/local/bin which you should add to your PATH.\n. Can't reproduce it. Do you still have the issue?\n. @craigeley have you tried with 1.7.1 release?\n. You can now do this with the latest 1.7.0 release.\n. Unsure if you have a 10.8 box I'd be glad to know.\n. @1-61803 so the reply feature is working but the actions are not if I understand correctly?\n. @1-61803 not sure but I think OSX 10.8 may be lacking the necessary APIs.\n. Please see #131\n. Thanks @yaauie \n. I added it to the Wiki, thanks! https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks\n. @renard you could try the solution described here http://stackoverflow.com/a/12121673\n. Hmm I have it on my El Capitan install.\n. Yes two lines maximum:\nterminal-notifier -message \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nabc\nxyz\nEOF\n)\" -title \"Multi line\"\n. Yes with the latest 1.7.0 release you now have a -timeout option :)\n. You can use execute instead of open:\nterminal-notifier -message test -execute \"open -b com.apple.systempreferences /System/Library/PreferencePanes/TimeMachine.prefPane\"\n. It could be. Let me think a bit more on this :)\n. @CarlAndersson it's planned for the next iteration, I'll keep you posted.. 1.8.0 is now packaged as a command-line app.. Sorry Github sucks at notifications, I only see your PR now. I'll have a look and keep you posted. Thanks!\n. @CharlieHess I've seen with @vjeantet and we decided it would be great to directly merge alerter's feature directly in terminal-notifier. So thanks for your PR but I've merged alerter's code directly.\n. @mikaelbr you can customize the buttons label or add a dropdown and with JSON output the sky is the limit :)\n. Related to #95 \n. Fixed in 1.8.0.. Thanks but the copyright is wrong and there are some limitations explained in the README :)\nI'll add a proper LICENSE file.\n. I'll try to revert this behavior, in the meantime you can use the -timeout option.\n. @JayBrown @rr0ss0rr you can expect a fix in 1.7.1 quite soon but it seems -activate and -open don't work well in Sierra, I've got to check that before releasing.\n. 1.7.1 is released with the fix to bring back the proper behaviour :)\n. Which version do you use?\n. Could you try this version https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/1.7.1 and tell me if it's better? (Not yet available via homebrew)\n. I managed to reproduce the issue when using -reply and no action is taken for example, this keeps terminal-notifier running and eating RAM.\n. @takuhii @frdmn what did you do with terminal-notifier in order to get this? Launch notifications manually, via a script... ?\n. @frdmn do you have the issue under 1.7.1?\n. @frdmn 1.7.1 is available via homebrew or you can download the executable here https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/1.7.1\n. Great, I close the issue, feel free to re-open it if needed.\n. I don't yet have a fix but I'm working on it. The code for the reply option was merged from https://github.com/vjeantet/alerter and it seems the leak was already there.. @mikaelbr yes it is but I'm having a hard time figuring out the proper fix.. Thanks @mikaelbr and @alloy! I already moved the NSString above the do, tried to alloc and initWithFormat to avoid using an autoreleased object but that's not enough. I reduces the leak a bit it seems but it's still there.. @mikaelbr @alloy tried some updates https://gist.github.com/julienXX/bb076b0b95c738217b03e14e51f23876 but still no luck. Leaking is reduced but still there. If you have some ideas to try I'm all ears.. @mikaelbr updated the gist but not better unless I misunderstood your comment.. @mikaelbr @killianbrackey @frdmn @takuhii the leak has been found and fixed thanks to @alloy help. I released 1.7.2 with the fix. Soon available via homebrew too.. Thanks @Zearin !\n. Hi @R0maric since Actions are no longer supported I'll close this issue. You can open a new one on the alerter repo if you still have this issue.. Hi, it looks like a bug. Adding -timeout 10, -reply or -actions options makes it work in the meantime.\n. Fixed in 1.8.0.. Thanks! Since terminal-notifier is already not suitable for MAS release, I guess it's okay.\n. Sure I'll add this.\n. You have to set your notification to Alert type for it to work.\n. @martinvandiemen in your preferences, you must set you notifications for terminal-notifier like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2kt0in8q6syiu6/Screenshot%202016-10-11%2014.27.27.png?dl=0\n. @martinvandiemen I haven't found how to manage those settings so far.\n. @rr0ss0rr unfortunately it's not possible, OSX Banner notification have a default timeout of 5 seconds. It works if you set the -timeout to less than 5 seconds but that's not very useful. So in Banner mode -timeout option is kinda useless.\n. Probably not but I'll check.\n. @rr0ss0rr @kootenpv yes you have a terminal-notifier per terminal-notifier version so maybe there is something to be done here.\n. I'm looking into this but I think there has been an API change between 10.10 and 10.11.\n. Fixed in 1.8.0.. Yes it is still maintained. Which version do you use? Which notification style do you use (Banner or Alert)?\n. Thanks for the detailed examples. This is a bug, I'll look into it.\n. Fixed in 1.8.0.. @dkristian yes it's fixed on the master branch but I'll wait a bit before releasing a new version.. Thanks @penne12 this looks pretty cool, I'll take a deeper look shortly.\n. @penne12 sorry I've been slow to review your PR. Could you juste maybe squash it into a single commit?. @penne12 thanks didn't know about that. Could you add a test for this too?. @trevorpburke my guess is that you should make your aliases global by putting them in /etc/profile maybe.\n. @trevorpburke still having the issue?. Well it's not supposed to be ran under Linux, macOS only. I guess the project you're trying to use needs some update to be used under Linux.. NSUserNotificationActivationTypeAdditionalActionClicked is defined for OSX 10.10+. I'll update the code accordingly.. Sorry @for-coursera I decided to not support 10.8 and 10.9 any longer. If you're stuck with this macOS version I advise you to use version 1.6.2. . @1-61803 I suppose it should work yes. Do you also need a 10.8 compatible version?. @1-61803 well honestly it's a hassle for me to maintain this older macOS compatibility and users on older systems can still use older versions of terminal-notifier (I should update the README for them). \nThe code is cleaner and easier to maintain if I just focus on the last 3 major versions of macOS. The new features use APIs not available on those systems. Also I've got no way to test on these older systems. \nBut if you have some very good arguments I may change my mind :). @vam Not reproducible on my 10.12 box, sorry. Can you confirm you have the latest version? How did you install it (gem, brew...)?. @vam @stetner @gniemetz can you confirm you had your notifications set as Alerts and not Banners? (cf. https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier#caveats). Thanks a lot @dcordero !. @allenm given your latest comment https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier/issues/60#issuecomment-264837833 I'm not sure it's terminal-notifier related.. Closing since there was no activity on this. Feel free to re-open if needed.. Thanks a lot @iRath96 ! Could you add a test to validate your PR please if that's not too complicated?. Thanks again!. @drukepple if your notifications settings for terminal-notifier is Banner, you need to hover over the notification, if it's set to Alerts type you should see the buttons.. @drukepple still having this issue?. Thanks @M0rph3v5, I'm closing the issue for now, @drukepple feel free to re-open it if you still have the issue.. @drukepple you must first set your alert type to Alert like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/6v29vakaiqigfme/Screenshot%202017-04-11%2012.26.52.png?dl=0. @drukepple Good idea! Do you want to open a pull-request with some Readme update?. The code to fix this has already been merged (https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/pull/177) I just need to make a new release :). Available in 1.7.2.. Fixed in 1.8.0.. @moshed it's planned for the next iteration. I'll keep you posted.. Same as #168 . @moshed Fixed in 1.8.0.. There is no API allowing terminal-notifier to do that. See https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/33. Could it be that you set your notification type to \"Alert\" instead of \"Banner\" in your notification preferences? https://www.dropbox.com/s/og1hl6padpujlu8/Screenshot%202017-01-17%2017.01.53.png?dl=0. @m-sureshraj I don't think it's possible.. @aristidesfl could you try to update to the latest terminal-notifier?. Fixed in 1.8.0.. Hi @ecbrodie sure I'll try to do it.. @ecbrodie the upcoming version won't be packaged as an app any longer and just as a command line tool so I'm not sure it will be needed.. 1.8.0 is no longer a .app so I'll close this issue.. @vitorgalvao Since it's a command line app, the small terminal icon is no longer here when using sender.. @vitorgalvao changing the icon on the binary with command+i as you would for any file seems to work well.. @vitorgalvao yes it seems to work only once and then OSX caches the icon forever it seems.. @vitorgalvao found a way to refresh the icon:\nrm $(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.notificationcenter/db/*\nthen restart Notification Center via the Activity Monitor. If it works for you too, I'll add it to the README.. Hi @dwaxe thanks for the PR, I would have added CFBundleIdentifier in parenthesis after bundle identifier. What do you think?. Thanks!. Hello @tanrax \nCan you give me some more information like:\n- OSX version\n- terminal-notifier version\n- how you installed it (homebrew, gem, other)\n- did it work before?\n- have you tried to re-install it?. Thanks, does it fail with other options too or just with | and/or -sound?. Are you using tmux or another kind of sub-shell?. Could you try if osascript -e 'display notification \"test\" with title \"TEST\"' has also an invalid connection to NSNotificationCenter?. @tanrax no worries, here are some tips regarding terminal-notifier & tmux https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/115. NSNotificationCenter seems to be unavailable outside of logged user space which looks like to be the case when using at or tmux.. Hi @redron thanks for the report. I really have no idea why it occurs as this variable is never used in terminal-notifier. I believe this is macOS related but I really have no clue sorry. I'll close the issue, don't hesitate to re-open it if you have some more informations.. As @charle692 wrote you need to have the alert type if you want long persisted notifications (>8s I believe). OS X has a default persistence time for notifications, see http://osxdaily.com/2014/01/29/change-notifications-banner-time-mac-os-x/ that affects banner mode. Not sure if the commands in the link still work though.. @shannon-pasto yes see #131 for more info.. Sorry it's not possible to have per notification stickiness at the moment (see #33) but you can set it for all notifications in System Preferences.. Thanks!. I added an example actions usage in the README https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier#exemple-actions-usage-with-a-shell-script-and-jq. Thanks @jonvandermeulen ! I'll have a better look ASAP.. I merged your changes manually, thanks for your PR :). Hi @jovendor, how did you install it (homebrew, gem, other)? Is it the latest version? Are you using tmux?. Hi @n1ck3 thanks for the report. I'll look into it and let you know it's possible.. Version 2.0.0 as been released with alerter features removed https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/2.0.0 so this issue is not relevant anymore as the reply flag is no longer available.\nClosing for now, feel free to re-open.. @marcastel thanks for the Makefile, I'll leave the issue here in case others are interested.. Thanks!. Thanks a lot!. @kliner you must escape special characters like terminal-notifier -message \"\\(\\\\)\" or terminal-notifier -message \"\\(._.)\". You're welcome. I suppose everything that can be interpreted as part of a shell command should be escaped (ie. quotes, parens...).. Thanks!. It's not intentional sorry, I'll try to fix it quickly.. It does work if you comply with the file:// protocol though:\nterminal-notifier -message 'hello' -open file://localhost/Users/julien/Downloads/IMG_0317.JPG worked for me.\nSo not sure it should be \"fixed\". What's your take on this?. Both syntax are valid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme, I'll update the code accordingly :). Fixed, I'll wait a bit for more issues before releasing a new version.. Thanks for the report, I'll investigate.. What's weird is that if you use Safari or Finder for sender the notification shows up.. Yes the .app bundle is now a classic command line executable. Sorry I'll update the README accordingly.. Hmm every example in the README should still work though. Can you try them and let me know which ones have issues on your side?. @majorsl @JayBrown I'll look into it.. @JayBrown -version will be in the upcoming release.. I think it could be the zsh-notify plugin which might have issues with the latest terminal-notifier. I'll investigate a bit. . @denschub @dkristian are you both talking about the CPU usage or the \"@CLOSED\" stuff?. @alloy yes I switched the default notification style to Alert in the plist file by mistake, I guess this causes those issues. I'll issue a fix soon.. @dfee I am but it's quite complicated to find the root cause.. Version 2.0.0 as been released with alerter features removed https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/2.0.0 \nThis issue should now be fixed, closing the issue for now, feel free to re-open.. I'll look into it.. @markburgessstl have you considered changing the alert style to \"Banners\" in the notifications preference pane?. Closing for now, feel free to re-open if needed.. Hello @luchofariello it looks like your script is ran using an account without access to the NSNotificationCenter.\nMaybe answers to this issue can help https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/145#issuecomment-166856810 ?. Still not using tmux so I won't be able to help here. Please refer to the previous tmux issues, closing this one for now.. It's a bug, you can add a -reply option in the meantime as a workaround.. Version 2.0.0 as been released with alerter features removed https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/2.0.0 so this issue should be fixed.\nClosing for now, feel free to re-open if it's not the case.. Hahaha I really love this kind of bugs \ud83d\ude2d. @JayBrown well you could try maybe it will solve the issue but I guess it rooted elsewhere.. Could you please try the updated 2.0.0 release?. @JayBrown maybe homebrew changed the way they package bundle apps. Glad to know it's working :). I'm closing this issue for now, feel free to re-open if needed.. @chew-z no, quick patch is always the wrong way to go. I'm working on it, in the meantime you can revert to 1.7.2.. Version 2.0.0 as been released with alerter features removed https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/2.0.0 so this issue is not relevant anymore as there is no more waiting for user action.\nClosing for now, feel free to re-open.. Hi @seldamat that would be a cool feature indeed. It's not possible yet but I'll look into this.. Closing for now. Version 2.0.0 as been released with alerter features removed https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/2.0.0 so this issue is not relevant anymore as the -reply flag is no longer available.. Thanks for the PR, I'll try to have a look quickly.. @shalecraig sorry while reviewing and testing your changes, I think I found another issue. I've got to do some more testing of the whole stuff sadly I don't have much time these days but I'll manage do do it somehow.. Closing for now. Version 2.0.0 as been released with alerter features removed https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/releases/tag/2.0.0. @franton yes it's already on the master branch, it will be released with 1.8.1.. Duplicate see #215 . @voldemortensen this happens when your notifications are not configured to use the alert style as stated is the Caveats section of the README.\nJust change the alert style to \"Alerts\" and you should not see this any longer.. Hi @Voleking I think your issue is a duplicate of #216 do you confirm?. Hi @franton you can switch the notification style from Alert to Banner in your System Preferences.. Sure, the upcoming release will have this setting reverted.. @BambiB You have a -json option to get the output as JSON, perhaps it will be easier.. Never stumbled across this, I'll try to reproduce.. @qqilihq were you able to reproduce using homebrew for installation by any chance?. Right, I'll re-release the binary unsigned then. Thanks for reporting this issue!. Updated the release if you want to try eventually.. Hi @CharlieIGG that's not possible, Notification Center is only available for a local account.. Thanks a lot @tmaher! . @arefaslani could it be that your XCode was not up to date and command line tools not installed?. Hi @arefaslani do you still have this issue?. Could you try the solution in #131 if it still works?. Thanks for this!\nFor the no-icon option, it seems not possible to provide as there is no API for it so far.. Hi @luckman212 could you try the solution described here https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/222#issuecomment-320980802 I had the same issue as many terminal-notifier where registered on my system. Deleting all terminal-notifier instances in the DB except fr.julienxx.oss.terminal-notifier could resolve the issue. At least it fixed my local dev machine.. Thanks a lot for the kind words <3. Hi thanks for the kind words! You could try to remove the instances following the method described here https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/222#issuecomment-320980802 unfortunately there is no easy way to uninstall terminal-notifier besides uninstalling via brew/gem or any other way you installed it. Regarding Sublime Text I'm not sure this would be related to terminal-notifier.. No problem :) brew uninstall terminal-notifier should be enough.. Terminal notifier should work just fine, it has just the sticky (more than 8s long) notifications removed.. You could try sudo gem install terminal-notifier -v 1.7.2. Cool! Glad it's working well for you :). Hi @AbdulHadiParsdorfer do you still encounter this issue?. Sorry it took me so long to get back to you. Could you try the solution described here https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/222#issuecomment-320980802 and let me know if that changes anything for you?. Ok thanks for the report. I\u2019ll close the issue for now.. Hi @cmal do you still have this issue?. Thanks for the report @NateEag . Thanks a lot!. @rien333 This would be nice but it will be painful for all the scripts that use terminal-notifier. Since terminal-notifier is mostly used like this or as a dependency I would prefer to have both syntax available for a while. Would you be interested in submitting a pull request?. Hi @plroebuck the screenshots were taken from alerter when we tried to merge the two projects, I should update these.\nThis issue is very low on my radar as Apple does not provide a way to do it so the only fix is to make a custom build.\nI could write a small HowTo in the README if I can figure a simple way.\nI don't have the time to provide and maintain custom builds. Sorry I can't fix this for now :/. Have you tried the possible solution with Automator https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/131#issuecomment-213752559 ?. There is also this option https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/237#issuecomment-372342497. Hi @mattmcmanus yes the -group option is what you need, it replaces previous notification with the same groupe identifier.. The API expects an image file so that won't be possible, sorry.. Hi thanks for the idea but I think that's not terminal-notifier responsibility to crop images so sorry but I won't add this feature.. It's not a matter of lines of code, I prefer to follow the UNIX philosophy of small tools doing focused tasks that you can pipe together.\nYou could use imagemagick do to do this and pipe the cropped image directly in terminal-notifier for example.. Hi @tjluoma sorry been quite busy these days, I'll have a look pretty soon.. Sorry I don\u2019t use or maintain node-notifier. You should open an issue on the node-notifier repo first.. Hi @JeganMSD do you have any way to reproduce like a script or something?. Thanks for reporting this. Not sure I can do something about it but I'll investigate.. Nice try but no :) If that's something a user really want it's always possible to compile multiple versions on a local machine.. This must have been installed by a dependency probably node-notifier.. If you run \u2018which terminal-notifier\u2019 in a Terminal, does it return anything?. To be sure and include hidden directories you can do a \u00ab\u00a0find . -iname terminal-notifier\u00a0\u00bb in your home directory, I\u2019m pretty sure it was installed by a third party development tool. I know node, ruby and elixir have libs that rely on it.. Hi @Vartkat maybe the solution described in https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/issues/148 can help.. No, you need XCode if you want to compile it yourself. In order to run it you should just need homebrew or you can download a stand-alone binary in the Releases on Github.. Have you tried to reset your Spotlight cache?. Have you tried using the full path for the diff tool and the files you want to compare?. Thanks a lot! Could you add a dash to activate too?\n. Display instead of Displayed\n. The list of actions available for the notification maybe?\n. Maybe it's time to change for macOS which is the current name.\n. Too many spaces before This I think.\n.

There\u2019s a way simper way:\nbash\ntouch /path/to/your/app # updates the icon in the finder\nkill \"$(ps -A | grep '/System/Library/CoreServices/NotificationCenter.app/Contents/MacOS/NotificationCenter' | grep --invert-match 'grep' | awk '{print $1}')\" # restarts Notification Center to update the icon there\n. Hope @julienXX doesn\u2019t mind me referencing it (since I\u2019m the author), but I\u2019ve been using a custom-built script for this for quite a long time, with much success.\nYou simply run it with customise-terminal-notifier --icon <file> --bundle <bundle_id> and it\u2019ll download the latest version of terminal-notifer to your Desktop and set your custom icon. You can then take that binary and use it as usual, without the need to set -appIcon and without having to recompile. To install the script, simply download it or do brew install vitorgalvao/tiny-scripts/customise-terminal-notifier (if you use Homebrew).\nKeep in mind, though, the icon will be set permanently on that specific binary, but if you\u2019re changing it to embed terminal-notifer in other apps, it\u2019s often enough. If you\u2019re distributing it, though, don\u2019t forget to include terminal-notifier\u2019s license. Also, in that case there may be (sometimes it happens, others it doesn\u2019t) a one-time warning about the binary having been changed (only the icon is changed).\n. > Do you mind if I reference your script in the README?\nDon\u2019t mind at all. Go for it.\n. For a bit more context on @mikemcduffie\u2019s comment, see https://github.com/vitorgalvao/tiny-scripts/issues/24.\nTo be clear, @mikemcduffie, customise-terminal-notifier has nothing to do with it. If you download an unmodified terminal-notifier it\u2019ll behave exactly as you describe.\nIssue is you\u2019re not just supposed to open terminal-notifier while telling it nothing. You\u2019re expected to give it the parameters you want it to run with.\n. @mikemcduffie I see your point. Perhaps the default message could be a note to the user they shouldn\u2019t be double-clicking on it, since it should be required by other apps.\n. @ecbrodie Make a request for it and someone will probably submit it within a day (I\u2019m a maintainer and see it happen constantly).\nHowever, for us to accept it in HBC it\u2019ll also have to be removed from HB (we try to not have duplicates between the projects).. @julienXX But this means we now lost the ability to set a custom icon on the app bundle. Since -sender is insufficient (it still leaves a small terminal icon in the title of the notification) what do you suggest now?. @julienXX My mistake, I didn\u2019t mean -sender (that one didn\u2019t show the little terminal icon), I meant -appIcon.. @julienXX Oh, that\u2019s even more convenient! That method is really useful. It should be part of the README.. Actually, I take it back. It is indeed convenient, but since macOS will then cache the icon, it isn\u2019t reliable if you want to do it multiple times.. @julienXX That will not solve embedding terminal-notifier in other applications, which is what I used to do, and the main point of changing its icon.\nThat solution will take care of the icon once, but as soon as you have two different terminal-notifier binaries on the system, both with different icons, it will no longer work. This makes changing the icon of the binary an insufficient solution for sharing apps with an embedded terminal-notifier. -sender is still the best option, which is fine.. ",

Which I think gives little value?\nAs for optimizing the loop it self, it looks like the entire\n[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%ld\", self.hash]\ncan be moved to above the do-while, also as @alloy says.\nLooks like maybe the current code is from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21110714/mac-os-x-nsusernotificationcenter-notification-get-dismiss-event-callback but there another identifier is used..

What you can do is to cd to the directory /Users/jacopodaeli/Desktop/PublipingTrainer.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw/node_modules/node-notifier/vendor/terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/ and check ls -l for the permissions of terminal-notifier.

The issue I'm trying to work around is an uninformed user opening the helper app and being confused. I know it's the regular behavior of the CLI binary.  \nI moved the discussion here since it would require terminal-notifier to change to improve the bundled version.\n. I think I see why @vitorgalvao and I are talking past each other. I had forgotten that terminal-notifier is an app bundle in it's standard deployment. It's been so long since I installed it that I misremembered and thought it was a CLI binary only and customise-terminal-notifier was unique in bundling it. My bad.\nHomebrew buries the app bundle so deep, it's not an issue for uninformed users. I had wanted to distribute the customized app with an Automator service in order to get a unique icon with the -open option. That and making it easier for novice users to install via drag and drop.\nI still believe that user notification on app bundle launch is still desirable given the customized versions and request @julienXX consider it as an enhancement. \nAny way, thanks again to both of you for your efforts.\n.

This is what I'm doing at the moment. I'm still getting \"password\" error messages for every sudo call in .stderr, but the script works fine anyway. The alternative would be to edit the system's sudoers file and whitelist my script, but I haven't tested it yet.\n. It might be the same reason why can run sudo osascript with some standard commands, but not sudo osascript with GUI scripting, e.g. opening a window to select a file, and then pass the filepath from osascript to the shell script. Otherwise you could use osascript to navigate into restricted directories like /private/var/root and select files in there.. Same here\u2026 my scripts\u2014and I have a huge amount of them using terminal-notifier.app\u2014don't continue unless I \"Close\" the t-n alert. Will revert back to v1.6.3, but looking forward to a fix with v1.7.1. But thank you for a great update. :)\n. I use the -execute option with the open command to open apps, directories, URLs. Always seemed nicer to me. ;)\n. It's just in one or two of my scripts, so I think I can wait it out until the bug fix. No rush. Do the more important stuff first. :)\n. The weird thing that it does work sometimes, but only in 1 out of 20 or 30 or so, so I stopped trying. For example, I have a background script looking for updates of my installed homebrew formulas. If there are updates, I get a notification. (It's a standard script floating around here on GitHub with some minor tweaks.) If it's an important update I run it, but manually with a command from my own BitBar system menulet. Furthermore, I added a little notification function if the homebrew stdout tells me that there are new formulas; in that case, when clicking \"Show\", terminal-notifier should open a temp txt file with the brew stdout and the application Cakebrew. In a lot of cases this doesn't work, but I don't know what the reason is. Maybe it has something to do with the background script having already exited or still running? (But it has only happened with the latest update.)\n(I'm on 10.11.6 as well, SIP disabled; switching to Sierra as soon as a decent version of GPGMail is available.). Yeah, v1.8.0 is still buggy. Doesn't display without sender. (OS X 10.11.6). It's not that big of a deal, I assume, because you can simply add -sender Finder, and you're good. By the way, in my notify template function I'm checking whether tn is installed, and if so, whether it's the old version (<1.8) or newer. In this regard, it would be great to have the argument terminal-notifier --version to print the current version number to stdout. Currently I need to grab it from the help output: https://github.com/JayBrown/notify/blob/master/notify.sh#L43-L44. I had temporary success when adding -sender Finder, but that stopped working after some time; then I switched to -sender SystemEvents, which also only worked for a short time.\nI still have the v1.7 application in my /Applications folder, and all my shell scripts that use the app's executable are working fine. The scripts that use the new 1.8 binary in /usr/local/bin directly, don't work at all. This needs a fix.\nOS X 10.11.6, homebrew installation. This might not have been a terminal-notifier bug, but one of the Notification Center. Because since yesterday everything has been working again, and the interesting thing is that when it first started working again, all of a sudden the 20 previous notifications that had not been displayed before, all popped up at once. I tested it manually with the other -sender commands that I had used (SystemEvents, Finder etc.), and there everything was. Don't know what kind of a bug this is. We'll see how long it lasts. ;). Aaaaaaaand\u2026 now it stopped working again.. You think I should just reset the whole Notification Center settings in $(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/db and try again? This almost smells like MacVoodoo.. Found a solution: use the above getconf command to print the /db directory, cd there, ls, and there should be the Notification Center database, just called \"db\". If it's there, run sqlite3 db 'select * from app_info', then look (or grep) for \"terminal-notifier\", \"julienxx\", and any entries that do not use the standard reverse URL scheme, e.g. for \"System Events\", if you used the -sender \"System Events\" option with terminal-notifier. The first db column is the ID assigned to the app. Then, for every relevant app-ID, you need to run sqlite3 db 'delete from app_info where app_id = <ID>' while replacing \"\\<ID>\" with the actual ID. Then run sudo killall usernoted, and then terminal-notifier works again. If necessary, you just need to change its settings again in the Notification Center preference pane.\nI'll monitor this in the next weeks, because I'm running the latest terminal-notifier from /usr/local/bin, but also still have some scripts that call the executable in the original .app bundle of previous terminal-notifier versions. Currently, they're working fine side by side, but maybe that's only temporary.. It's been running fine so far. The weird thing, however, is that terminal-notifier is selecting some random app icon from my /Applications directory as the secondary icon, in this case the icon of the app gfxCardStatus. Seems to be another bug. :)\n. Really? Rewrite? It's not yet on homebrew, but I'll test it soon.. I've now tested v2.0.0 with my default notify function by simply running the script, and it seems to look good. No weird inline app icons anymore (see below; it's just the Terminal icon again). What's interesting, though, is that calling /usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier directly also works from within a script, not only the standard method of calling the .app executable: the upper notification is /usr/local/bin/, the lower is executable in /usr/local/Cellar/terminal-notifier. Was this behavior planned? I thought that v2.0.0 would return to the exlusive .app method. (?)\n\nNow I have to go through my dozens of scripts to see if they need tweaking. Oh crap. :D . Tested it again, this time with a self-contained script running via Automator (macOS Services), and calling the binary did not work. So I assume that the .app executable should be called. If however you run a script directly on the command line, e.g. in iTerm, then calling the binary seems to work.. The trick making your own fake app, changing its icon, and using its BundleID for the -sender option still works. But when trying this out, I stumbled across a different solution. When you change the Terminal.icns file in terminal-notifier.app/Contents/Resources, while keeping the basename or changing the string in Info.plist, of course, and then use a non-existent BundleID, e.g. -sender com.apple.FakeApp, then terminal-notifier will show its own app icon, which will be your replacement icon. Example:\n. Now I only need to see if it's possible to show no icon at all, maybe with a transparent 1px image as .icns file. (?). It's possible using a transparent image, but it still leaves empty space. Doesn't look good.\n. I've reverted to changing the Terminal.icns file in the terminal-notifier.app bundle:\n\nThis changes the app icon as shown by the system\u2026\n\n\u2026and that's how it's also displayed in the first line of the terminal-notifier notification:\n\nBut that's something that every user can do for himself, or a developer, if he wants to bundle terminal-notifier with his own software, i.e. you wouldn't need to update terminal-notifier itself for it.\nAs for no icon at all, I don't think the user can implement this on his own somehow. It should be dealt with in a terminal-notifier update, if it's at all possible, which I currently doubt.. ",

    "rr0ss0rr": "+1 - Funny, I was just looking how to do this ;-)\n. Thanks .. I reverted back to 1.6.3 .. My thought is if you did not use one of the new Alerter options, that terminal-notifier would work as it did in 1.6.3.  Unfortunately, I use terminal-notifier a lot ;-) so it would be a little inconvenient to change it every where.\nThanks again\n. Thanks for the quick fix ..\n. I have Alerter set up as \"Alerts\" in notification center and Terminal-notifier as \"Banners\".  I was hopeful  that with the new code, I would be able to have a \"Banner\" act as an \"Alert\".  Alerter is used only in the situations where I want the message to stay on the screen until I click on it.  For the most part, I just want Terminal-notifier to act as \"Banners\" so I don't want to set Terminal-Notifier messages to be Alerts in Notification center.\n. Can terminal-notifier some how be registered twice in Notification Center?  Then you can set one as alerts and the other as banners. Probably not. \n. Perhaps there is a way to create a separate bootstrap that calls terminal-notifier where it could have it's own notification center entry .. ie terminal-notifier-alert\n. Yup .. Make sure you are running it as you and to keep it simple, have it run a script that you own.  I do this myself.  If you need it to run through sudo, just modify /etc/sudoers (visudo) to authorize your userid (via the admin group per below) to run the commands that you need.  ie\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL, NOPASSWD: /sbin/mount, /sbin/umount, .... I would move the command to a script owned by user and have launchctl run the script. \nYour example \n/Users/user/terminal-notifier -title \"title\" -subtitle \"subtitle\" -message \"message\" -actions \"actions1\",\"actions2\" -dropdownLabel \"dropdownLabel\" -appIcon pathalert.icns -sound \"frog\" -timeout 120\nWhere are your actions defined?  You mentioned sudo, but your command doesn't reflect the command.  Is terminal-notifier located in your parent directory?  Also, I would not run terminal-notifier as an alert or wait for a response in launchctl without having the command be run as a background process (& at the end)\n. I thought the issue was terminal-notifier 1.8 changed the notification type in error to Alerts. I changed it back to Banners in Notification Center. . See if it's located at: /usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier\nYou can also issue a \"brew list\" to see if it's installed (even though there are other package managers that could have been used).. ",

The notification disappears after a few seconds; I thought that if you were requesting input from the user (via buttons) then the notification would hang around until dismissed. As it was, the notification never stayed up long enough for me to click on anything (turns out: the buttons were there, but only visible after hovering over the notification). Meanwhile, the command line never received any kind of reply and was \"hanging.\" I'm not sure what the intention is, but it seems to me that if you are expecting/requiring user input, then the notification shouldn't disappear until the user interacts with it.\nAgain, I'm just using the example provided in the readme:\nterminal-notifier -title ProjectX -subtitle \"new tag detected\" -message \"Deploy now on UAT ?\" -closeLabel No -actions Yes.  I see no buttons unless I manage to hover over the notification before it slides away. The terminal goes into a state of waiting for something happen before exiting terminal-notifier, but if the notification slides away, there's no other option other than Control-C.  Am I using this wrong?\n. Oh, my gosh. That's what was going on? It works now, thank you. I don't see any mention of this in the Read Me...maybe add an item under \"Caveats\"?.

The command open ~/SomeDir will open the directory in Finder (you can also do something like open /Applications/TextEdit.app ~/SomeDir/SomeFile.foo - you get the idea)\nAs of this writing, this only works if you also include the -actions switch.

Also, I do not have brew installed (never used it), so the command doesn't work at the terminal.\n@julienXX Nope. Doesn't return anything.\nSince I'm not getting any search results for file name hits, neither a file that would contain the string \"terminal-notifier\", I'm suspecting that somewhere there's an invisible file that is responsible - hence the file is not turning up in the search result. Hope it's not some sort of malware disguised as \"terminal-notifier\", so I just better do a clean install.\nAlso, my activity monitor doesn't return any task that would otherwise be running as such. When I check the usage (on this repo), I cannot even issue the command at the terminal \"terminal-notifier...\" because there's no such command. Weird.\nAnyhow. Thank you guys for the feedback. I just go ahead and do a clean install. It usually takes me 30 minutes or so.. @julienXX Thanks, I just tried the search at the terminal as you suggested and I didn't get any results.\nI have the same dev setup on both my Mini and MacBook, but interestingly it only shows up on the Mini..

The solution in #148 by @applebit924 seems a bit cryptic to me. I understand he's notifications are not fired by his main script but by a script fired by a watchdog. The watchdog runs from /Library/LaunchAgents and not from /Library/LaunchDaemons, but for the rest I don't see terminal-notifier in there unless he renamed it \"Software Update Notifications\" and I don't understand why he's building a notification script each time he needs to show a notification.
