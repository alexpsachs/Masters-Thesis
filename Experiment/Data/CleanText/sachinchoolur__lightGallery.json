    "sachinchoolur": "Hi,\nThank you for your support. The issue has been fixed and uploaded.\nplease let me know if it  happens again.\nRegards,\nSachin \n. Hi,\nas per your code the lightGallery() is getting called before getting data from  getFacebookPictures() function. you can fix this issue by adding lightGallery() inside the ajax success function. please have a look at this link http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/94WLe/\n. Hi,\nThank you for your suggestion.\nit was a known issue.. but forgot to update..\n. Updated..\n. Hi Joshua,\nSorry for the delayed replay, i was looking into this issue.\nthis option required lots of code and workflow changes. so better you can use Tammo's method.(@Tammo0 thank you for your time).\nregards,\nSachin.\n. Joshua,\nI will try to implement this feature..\n. Hi\nmethod 1 (trigger click).\nwhile clicking on the launch button you can trigger click for the first li.\nexample http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/QQpdL/4/ \nmethod 2 (Load Dynamically).\nplease go threw the example http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/examples.html#dynamicBlock\njsfiddle > http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/Zf4UQ/3/\nyou can use any of these methods  for solving your issue.\nRegards,\nSachin\n. Thanks Tammo,\ndestroy method does not work from outside the function.\nlightGallery is a fullscreen gallery and can contain only images and videos. so i thought public methods are not required..\n. Yes  i agree.\nLightGallery has the destroy method.  when we click on close button  lightgallery calls the destroy method and it cleans all the changes and events done on its initialize.\nBut in your case you want to close lightGallery from outside.\ncould you provide your URL then i will get a better idea. \n. HI,\nThank you very much for your support. now i have a clear idea about your problem.\nDestroy method will be added soon.\n. Hi Tammo,\nI have created one more repository called lightslider.\nplease have a look at this link http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/index.html\nand please let me know your suggestions if you have time.\nThanks,\nSachin.\n. Hi,\nIt works fine for me. \nhtml\n<ul id=\"lightGallery\">\n  <li data-src=\"img/img1.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb1.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n  <li data-src=\"img/img2.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb2.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n</ul>\njavascript\nvar gallery = $(\"#lightGallery\").lightGallery(); \n $.ajax({url:\"demoURL\",success:function(data){\n    $(\"#lightGallery\").append(data);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        gallery.destroy(); // destroy gallery\n        gallery = $(\"#lightGallery\").lightGallery(); //re-initiate gallery\n    }, 100);\n  }});\n. Hi,\nIn your demo code you are not assigning lightGallery to gallery variable and you are destroying gallery variable. Please have a look at the updated fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/L8d031ud/16/\n. Thanks for pointing this out.\n. Hi @erbertian \nI have added link for the caption.You can enable this option by setting 'captionLink=true'.\nPlease have a look at this link http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/qn656/\nRagards,\nSachin N\n. Hi Erbertian,\nIt's working fine for me.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/NDm5h/1/\n. Hi @tammo0,\nI am not able to merge your pull request. your repository seems to be unavailable.\n. HI,\nWe can fix this issue by setting current slide z-index to 9.\nplease include these css code into your document.\nlightGallery-slider.fadeM.on .current {z-index: 9;}\nTammo's pull request is still pending ('for slide count'). so i am not able to upload updated css file.\nRegards,\nSachin.\n. @tammo0, It is working now.\n. HI Erbertian,\nYesterday i couldn't test that properly. sorry for the inconvenience.\nthe issue has been fixed and uploaded. please do replace lightGallery.css\nhere is the updated fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/NDm5h/2/\n. Thanks Roman Getman. :+1: \n. HI,\nThanks for pointing this out. The issue has been fixed and uploaded.\nplease let me know if it happens again.\nRegards,\nSachin\n. HI @erbertian,\nI have updated lightGallery.js for the above issue. \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/NDm5h/3/\nCould you please check on any iOs device and please let me know if you found any issue.\nThanks,\nSachin\n. Hi @tammo0 ,\nPreviously we ware preventing the default action of touchend using event.preventDefault();\nand iOS mobile browsers raises touch events  instead of click events so i have modified enableTouch() function. it is working fine on iPad. I have tested it but just wanted to confirm from @erbertian. And i believe that assigning href threw javascript is not  a good practice if we have any another way. \nplease compare these two files.\nhttps://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/blob/master/light-gallery/js/lightGallery.js#L162\nhttps://github.com/tammo0/lightGallery/blob/master/light-gallery/js/lightGallery.js#L161\n. Hi @tammo0, \nHave you updated any js file for this issue?\n. Hi @macsupport,\nWe are using Base64 encoded font icons so no need to include any font files.\nthese css lines are not required. i added by mistake.\nThanks,\nSachin N\n. Hi Luca,\nCurrently it is not possible i will implement this feature soon.\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. Thanks Luca.\n. Hi @erbertian,\nI was also out of the state for a few days. I have fixed this issue, could you please check this on iOS because i don't have any iOS device to check this issue.\nThanks,\nSachin N\n. Hi,\nFirst of all this is not a critical issue. user can pause the current video and go to next one. i did not get time to work on this feature. I hope i will be able to work on this after January.\nRegards,\nSachin\n. Hi guys,\nI have included this feature in the new version. It is almost ready and i will be releasing it soon.\nThanks.\n. Hi guys,\nFinally i have released version 1.2 with this feature..\n. I have included this feature in lightgallery version 1.2..\n. HI @alias1,\nThank you for your valuable suggestions..\nI will be working on this options soon..\n. Hi, \nI have added fixed size and fullscreen options in the new version..\n. I thought we can keep index and readme page settings for quick reference with default values and settings page for detailed reference. what you think?\nOnce again thank you for your contribution.\n. Sure. Please follow the same style of index page. \nSomething like this  https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty#options\nThanks in advance .\n. HI @dchekanov, \nI have some urgent works and i am running out of time.\nIt would be grateful if you could help me.\nThanks,\nSachin N.\n. Thank you very much for your time and effort..\n. Hi @devmondo,\nI didn't get what you meant. Could you please explain..\n. It works fine for me. there might be some conflict between lightGallery.css and your css.\nit would be helpful if you could send me your source code.\n. HI @devmondo,\nlightGallery does not support rtl direction slides. Except everything you can make rtl direction and you can fix the arrows and thumbnail issue by adding the following css lines into your document \n```\nlightGallery-action {\ndirection: ltr;\n\n}\nlightGallery-Gallery .thumb_cont {\ndirection: ltr;\n\n}\n```\n. Hi Paul,\nIt would be helpful if you could provide a JSFiddle for your setup..\n. Hi @zel777,\nI don't have any iOS device to check this issue. I will check this once i get an iPad.\n. HI @zel777,\nI have tested this issue on iphone 5s but i couldn't find and problem. lightGallery respond correctly to the toolbar.\nIt would be helpful if you could attach a screenshot of your screen.\nThanks,\nSachin N.\n. Thank you very much.. :+1: \n. Thank you for pointing this out.\n. HI Chris,\nIt works fine for me. lightGallery was tested on iPad. Is this working without relation?\nCould you please provide your project URL or a JSFiddle if it is possible.\nRegards,\nSachin N.\n. Hi Chris,\nI don't have any iOS device to check this issue. I will check this once i get an iPad.\n. Ya might be. I will try to fix this issue.\n. Thanks Jack,\nI will implement this feature soon.\n. Hi Jack,\nThank you very much for your time and efforts.\n. HI,\nI really wanted to help you but  i don't have an iphone to check this issue. I will try to arrange one.\n. Hi @erbertian,\nI have tested this issue on iPhone 5s, and close button works fine for me.\nwhen we play the video it opens up in the ios native player and once exit from the fullscreen mode it goes to the default mode.\nCould you please test this with latest lightGallery.js\nI think the size of the close button need to be increased..\nThanks,\nSachin N\n. Could you please be more specific on what is the issue?\n. Hi @piga,\nIf you want the same style which is used on the demo website please do add the following css in to your document\ncss\n.list-unstyled {\n    list-style: none outside none;\n    padding-left: 0;\n}\n.gallery li {\n    display: block;\n    float: left;\n    height: 100px;\n    margin-bottom: 6px;\n    margin-right: 6px;\n    width: 100px;\n}\n.gallery li a {\n    height: 100px;\n    width: 100px;\n}\n.gallery li a img {\n    max-width: 100px;\n}\nyou can add any style for this ul li elements. no need to follow the same style. it is up to you\nBut you should follow the same HTML Structure which is described on demo website.\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. For ul\nhtml\n<ul id=\"lightGallery\" class=\"gallery list-unstyled\"></ul>\n. Hi,\nThis issue has already been resolved.. https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/20\nPlease use latest version.\nSachin N \n. Thanks ..  :+1: \n. Thanks Tom,\nI was also thinking the same. For tablet and mobiles preloading all images is not a good option (for larger galleries ) .\nSoon I will start working on this :+1: \n. Hi,\nI have Fixed this issue,I have added a preload settings which controls the number of preload slides.\nonce the current slide is fully loaded then according to the preload value the remaining slides will be preloaded..\nex:  If you clicked on 4th image and if preload = 1 then 3rd slide and 5th slide will be loaded in the background after the 4th slide is fully loaded.. if preload is 2 then 2nd 3rd 5th 6th slides will be preloaded.. ... ...\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. Waiting for your feedback...\n. HI,\nCould you please provide a jsfiddle for your setup?..\n. Hi,\nThis works fine for me please have a look at the bellow link\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/Zf4UQ/4/\nCould you please provide a fiddle for your setup..?\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. Fixed both bugs.. Please check..\n. HI,\nCurrently lightGallery supports only vimeo and youtube videos..\nI can add embed local videos if it is useful for most users..\nMay be in next major release.. \n. Hi,\nThank you very much for your help and support. @alias1 had already posted this as an issue but i was busy with some works so i couldn't add..\nThanks..\n. Hi,\nThis could be done by using jQuery event.stopPropagation() method if it is a normal button. but Pinterest button does not  catch 'Click' event http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23846610/pinterest-button-is-not-catching-click-event.. Anyway adding custom selector is a good idea..\nI have added a custom selector property in the settings. So gallery will be construct by using the selector elements..\nI have created a fiddle for you. please have a look at this.. http://jsfiddle.net/ptyq8/1/\nNote: This feature has not been included in the main lightGallery.js you have to copy from the fiddle..  Soon i will release new version with this feature...\nRegards,\nSachin N.\n. Thanks, it's a good suggestion. will be added soon..\n. Hi @runyugin ,\nSee issue #49 .For current use you can copy js from the fiddle.\n. HI, \nI have released lightGallery v1.1.3 with this feature..\n. Hi,\nI don't have any IOS device to check this issue.\nHow many images are there in your gallery..?\nI had included 'preload' option in the last release. Please set preload:0 and try again..\nAny help with this would be much appreciated.\n. Hi,\nAre you using title or description for your gallery. If you are using please try without title and description (only images) and set preload:0;\n. HI,\nIt seems like IOS crashing due to some CSS property..\nI am busy with some other projects and i hope i can look at this after this week..\nRegards..\n. Hi,\nI have fixed this issue.. Please check..\n. Hi,\nI have updated lightGallery.js again..\nPlease download new file..\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. Hi,\nI am not sure what you mean..\nWhere do you want to add the close button.?. Could you please provide a wireframe for this..\nif you want to change the style of the close button you can do it by using CSS.\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. Currently public functions are not available..\nfor current use modify lightGallery.js line number 153\njavascript\n$('#lightGallery-close').bind('click touchend', function () {\n     $this.destroy();\n});\nTo \njavascript\n$('#lightGallery-close, #yourButtonId').bind('click touchend', function () {\n     $this.destroy();\n});\n. HI,\nCurrently it is not possible. but lightGallery supports caption and description which you can add threw data-title and data-desc..\nRegards..\n. HI, \nI have released lightGallery v1.1.3 with this feature..\n. Hi Jodie,\nThe issue has already been resolved #51 .\nI have tested with more than 100 images and it is working fine.\n\nPlease download latest files and check..\nRegards,\nSachin\n. Hi,\nI have tested this again and works fine for me.\nplease re-open if you still have issue..\n. See issue #49\n. Hi,\nCurrently this feature is not available ..\n. It works fine for me. Could you please provide a jsFiddle for your setup?.\n. Hi,\nIt was created for my personal use. if there is no caption and description the plugin will create caption and description with the position of the image.. and now i too think it is not required.. thanks for pointing this out..\nAnyway for the next version i am planing to provide html instead of title and description..\nThanks..\n. Ya sure... For the next release..\n. HI, \nI have released lightGallery v1.1.3 with this feature. please have a look.\n. Hi, \nSorry for the delayed response,\nCurrently i am using fade effect when img/iframe loads successfully. if you want more fade effect just increase transition duration..\non line number 160 .lightGallery-slide img, .lightGallery-slide iframe\n. I am adding a complete class when a slide loads successfully. By default lightgallery preloads two slides once the active slide fully  loaded.. so complete class will be added in the background and we will not be able to see the fade effect.. if you prefer you can change preload count to 0 in the settings.. \n. It should work on chrome and firefox without any extensions. did you change the transition value of opacity\ncss\n.lightGallery-slide img, .lightGallery-slide iframe {\ntransform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n-moz-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n-ms-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n-webkit-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n-o-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n-webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 2s ease 0s;\n-moz-transition: -moz-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 2s ease 0s;\n-o-transition: -o-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 2s ease 0s;\n-ms-transition: -ms-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 2s ease 0s;\ntransition: transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 2s ease 0s;\n}\nit would be helpful if you could provide a jsfiddle for your setup..\n. HI,\nI have tested this many times and i couldn't find any issues. it would be helpful if you could record your screen and send me (screenshot won't be sufficient). \n. Hi,\nThis feature is already available..\nPlease have a look at this issue #11 \n. I have added this feature. \nPlease have a look at this link http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/82L2R/2/\n. Hi,\nThis feature has been removed since version 1.1.3. and added custom html support. you can display your custom html instead of just caption and description. Place  your html inside data-sub-html attribute. \nhttps://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/releases/tag/v1.1.3\nPlease have a look at the updated jsfiddle\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/82L2R/3/\n. Thanks for pointing this out :+1: \nI will update ..\n. HI, \nI have released lightGallery v1.1.3 with this feature..\n. Hi,\nThanks for pointing this out. Did you include fonts folder ?..\n. Hi,\nI totally forgot about this issue..\nI have released lightgallery 1.2.. Please check the issue once again.. If still it is not working i will add png images also with font icons..\n. Hi, i will let you know if i include this feature..\n. HI,\nI have released lightGallery v1.1.4 with local html5 video support. Please check.\n. Hi,\nFor displaying html5 video create your video content using html5 video tag inside a hidden div  and just add id or class name of  the object(hidden div) which contain your html inside the data-html attribute.  data-src should not be provided when you use html5 videos . You can even provide video html directly inside data-html attribute. lightGallery will automatically check your content and if it is id or class name of your hidden div content will be fetched from the div and will be displayed as video otherwise direct content will be used to display video. \nPlease have a look at the demo http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/examples.html Local HTML5 videos\n. HI,\nIt works perfectly for me. see the demo http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/fbxmnj5z/1/\n. Thank you for pointing this out. if you like you can surely submit a pull request..\n. Thank you very much for your consideration.. I will let you know if i need any help..\n. Hi,\nI have fixed this issue. thank you for pointing this out..\nRegards,\nSachin \n. HI,\nYou can use dynamic mode to do this. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/examples.html#dynamicBlock\nI have created a jsfiddle for you Please have a look at this link http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/Zf4UQ/5/\n. HI,\nis this happening on mobile devices ?.. normally slides loads in the background according to the preload value. buy default it is 1 and you can change from the settings.\nI have tested issue #15 many times and i couldn't find any issue.\nIt would be helpful if you could provide a jsfiddle for your setup.\nRegards,\nSachin \n. Hi,\nyou need to enable html in the settings\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() { \n    $(\"#lightGallery\").lightGallery({ \n        counter:true,\n        html:true \n    });\n});\n```\nNote : Whatever you provide inside data-html attribute will be appended to the slide element(li)\nSo you need to style your caption by yourself.. if you want the default lightGallery caption style you can place your caption inside <div class=\"customHtml\"></div>\nhtml\n<li data-src=\"/fotos/Foo.jpg\" data-html=\"<div class='customHtml'>This is Foo</div>\"></li>\nplease have a look at the demo. http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/hg5nmj39/2/\nRegards,\nSachin N\n. you can set position bottom:0  in the css  \n``` css\n.customHtml {\n    background: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);\n    bottom: 0;\n    color: #fff;\n    font-family: Arial,sans-serif;\n    height: 70px;\n    left: 0;\n    position: absolute;\n    right: 0;\n    z-index: 9;\n}\n```\nTo re position next prev controllers (#lightGallery-action) update lightGallery.css line number 348 \n. The above jsfiddle was using older lightgallery syntax. It has been updated in the new version 1.1.4  Here is the updated jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/hg5nmj39/8/ \nUpdates :-\nchange data-html to data-sub-html.\nhtml: true in the setting is not required in the newer version\n. You can add anchor tag inside data-sub-html attribute .\nHere is the demo http://jsfiddle.net/hg5nmj39/12/\n. Hi,\nThe issue has already been resolved #64 .I merged the pull request \nPlease download lightGallery.js from github master branch https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/blob/master/light-gallery/js/lightGallery.js\nRegards,\nSachin\n. Hi,\nThis can be done via css. set width of #lightGallery-action a to 50% and position it left and right accordingly. the first half of gallery should be covered by prev button. and second half should be covered by next button.\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. \nAre you using version 1.1.3 ?..\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. \nThere was some issue with package name. it is now registered successfully. http://bower.io/search/?q=lightgallery\n. Thanks :)\n. HI,\nLightGallery drag and swipe functions preventing the focus of the input. you can just disable from the settings \njavascript\n$('#lightGallery').lightGallery(){\n    enableTouch: false,\n    enableDrag: false\n}\nRegards,\nSachin\n. In the demo website input inherits white color from .customHtml div\nMay be because of this you are not getting correct output.\nset input color black and try\ncss\ninput {\n    color: #000;\n}\nIf it is still not working please provide a jsfiddle for your setup.\n. I have tested this locally and works fine.\nCould you please provide a jsfiddle for your setup?\n. Yes. it was not there in version 1.1.3. Actually I forgot to mention these changes in version 1.1.4 change log.\nI will update it..\n. Thank you :+1: \n. HI,\nSorry I missed your message.\nThere is no option to show text with images using settings. but according to your gallery design you can change the positing of text block using CSS.\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delay from my side. and thank you very much for your effort and time..\nI have added support for responsive images in new version..\nPlease have a look at this link and let me know if you have any suggestions..\nThanks,\n. Great suggestion.\nMany people requested me the same but I thought css only layout (without using javascript) is better.\nAnyway this is a much needed addition and will be included in the next version..\nThanks\n. It would be better if you could provide a demo for your setup.\n. Hi,\nFirst of all the direct children of a ul element must all be li elements. \nHowever you can use selector property for fixing this issue.\nhtml\n <ul id=\"lightGallery\">\n    <li class=\"portfolio_li\"></li>\n    <li class=\"portfolio_li\"></li>\n    <br />\n    <li class=\"portfolio_li\"></li>\n</ul>\njavascript\n$('#lightGallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: '.portfolio_li'\n})\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/p1aw7utk/5/\n. Hi,\nNew release was not a major one. I will include this feature in lightGallery version 1.2. It is already under development. If you want i will give you a demo within two days.\n. Hi,\nPlease have a look at this link http://sachinchoolur.github.io/\nThis is just for a demo not even 50% completed. I will try to release new version as soon as possible.\n. If you want thumbnails animation while moving the slide you have to align it to left. But still you can set currentPagerPosition: 'middle' to center the active thumbnail.\nIf you are not using animateThumb: true you can align it however you want using css.\nIf you want border around thumb you can add it via css..\n. Hi guys,\nI have released lightgallery version 1.2 with this feature..\nPlease check.\n. Hi,\nIf loop is true lightslider will create clone of first and last slides with extra class name .clone\nAnd for non clone slides .lslide class will be added.\nSo you can use lightGallery's custom selector property to set .lslide as selector.\nI have created a jsfiddle demo for you please have a look http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/eedf7pon/3/\n. I am planing to release next version soon.\nI will follow jQuery boilerplate folder structure so this issue will be fixed..\n. Hi,\nI have released lightgallery 1.2 with dist folder ..\n. Yes It is possible. you can insert custom video html into the gallery.\nexample : http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/fz0ntwbm/2/\n. Hi,\nIn the next version i will include a callback function after appending the video html.\nFor current use please refer the updated jsfiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/fz0ntwbm/9/\n. Yes it is possible. \nYou can use custom selector property to do this \nCheck the updated fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/fbxmnj5z/6/\n. I think the best way is using dynamic mode only.\nIf you don't want to use dynamic mode you can display only one thumbnail and hide remaining thumbnails.\nSee the example fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/p1aw7utk/9/\n. If you click on the black area of the gallery by default gallery will get close.\nIf you want to disable this just set closable: false\njavascript\n$('#lightGallery').lightGallery({\n    closable: false\n})\n. OK got it.\nI will improve this in the next version..\n. I think you can use  onSlideBefore() function which will execute immediately before each slide transition.\nI will add slide parameter for onSlideBefore(slide) callback function in the next version.\n. Hi,\nI have released lightgallery version 1.2.\nHere you can see more information about events..\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Hi,\nYour code is not completely visible. You can check here how to insert html code in your message https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n. Thank you for your suggestion.\nI think this method does not work with a markup like this \nhtml\n<div class=\"gallery\" data-src=\"1.jpg\" ></div>\n<div class=\"gallery\" data-src=\"1.jpg\" ></div>\n<div class=\"gallery\" data-src=\"1.jpg\" ></div>\n``` javascript\n('.gallery').each(function(){\n$(this).lightGallery({\n    selector: this\n});\n\n});\n```\nBut i hope i can manage this.\nThanks.\n. Hi guys,\nI have released lightgallery version 1.2..\nHere you can see more information about custom html markups.. \n. You can just pass 'this' via selector setting.\njavascript\n$('.light-gallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: 'this'\n});\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delay here. data-html. attribute meant for html5 videos. whatever code you put inslide data-html attribute will be consider as a video html and inserted in to video container. Inserting form into the gallery would not be a good idea. \n. Hi,\nThank you for your suggestions. But this is possible with current functionality.\nYou can use selector setting to select custom gallery item and use data-thumb attribute to provide thumbnail url.\nEx: \nhtml\n<img data-thumb=\"thumbnailUrl.jpg\">\njavascript\n$(\"img\").each(function () {\n    $(this).lightGallery({\n        selector: this\n    });\n});\nPlease have a look at the demo  http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/p1aw7utk/12/\nI am trying to Modularize ligthGallery. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.\n. Hi,\nNo. use data-html attribute only for inserting local video Whatever html you put inside data-html attribute will be inserted into video content. \nI am trying to modularise lightGallery may be i can provide a module for html content.\n. Hi,\nThank you very much for your time and effort.\nYour code gives error when loop or thumbnail is enabled.\nCould you please fix those issues and submit a new pull request because it already giving conflict with existing code.\n. Hi,\nCurrently this is not possible with default functionality. But you can try with youtube API.\n. Hi,\nDid you attach any image here? .It is not visible.\nIt would be better if you could provide a jsfiddle demo or your website url if it is available.\n. Hi,\nI think still it is not completely visible. \nDo you have any trouble with posting message https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n. Hi,\nCurrently lightGallery doesn't support this type of video url. I will try to improve it\nFor current use you can directly copy video url from  browser and use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9yGcKlYAiw&list=PLE2714DC8F2BA092D\nhere is the demo http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/gk8yj2ak/1/\n. Hi,\nonOpen callback executes once the slider is initialized. If any delay is their as you said you can manage with settimeout function.\nI am completely rewriting lightGallery and i will try to add a callback once the gallery is fully loaded..\n. Hi,\nThank you for your consideration but it is not necessary. If you like lightGallery or any of my other repos please star it or tweet about it. that would make me happier than a donation :)\nI will try to release new version within a month. if you want i can give you access to my private repository may be after a week.\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Hi,\nAs you said by default  e.propagation() is not required. I think it may require to use only in some rare cases.  so instead of giving option for enabling disabling  event.stopPropagation()  we can completely remove it lightGallery.js. If anybody wants to use they can easily add in to the code.\nI have merged some pull requests just before few minutes and now your pull requests gives conflict with existing code. \nSo it would be better if you could remove e.stopPropagation(); from lightGallery.js and  submit a new pull request.\nThanks.\n. Thanks for the links. \nI am working on lightGallery version 1.2. I will try to follow these standards.\nIt would be helpful if you could do a pull request for the current version.\n. Hi,\nWith default functionality it is not possible but you achieve this by updating lightGallery.js line number 658.\njust pass index in the onSlideBefore callback function\njavascript\n// settings.onSlideBefore.call(this, plugin);  to\nsettings.onSlideBefore.call(this, plugin, index);\nHere is the demo http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/p1aw7utk/14/\n. Hi,\nI am working on lightGallery version 1.2. Once it is done will be able to access all the variables and functions of lightGallery from outside \n. Hi,\nI had tested lightGallery with more than 100 images on ipad and could not find any issue.\nThis might be because of insufficient memory. Any way there is an option for displaying low resolution images for mobile devices.\nCreate separate small resolution images for mobiles and put url inside  \"data-responsive-src\" attribute and set mobileSrc : true\n ex: \nhtml\n<ul id=\"lightGallery\">\n  <li data-src=\"img/img1.jpg\" data-responsive-src=\"image/img-low-resolution1.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb1.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n  <li data-src=\"img/img2.jpg\" data-responsive-src=\"image/img-low-resolution2.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb2.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n</ul>\njavascript\n$('#lightGallery').lightGallery({\n    mobileSrc : true    \n});\nLightGallery does not load all images at a time. it depends on the preload setting.\nif the 4th slide is active and preload is 1 then 3rd slide and 5th slide will be loaded in the background after the 4th slide is fully loaded.. if preload is 2 then 2nd 3rd 5th 6th slides will be loaded. \nYou can check this with any browser  developer toolbar like firebug .\n. Hi,\n- In the video example a tag is not required. It was added by mistake. There is no specific markup for lightGallery. If you want you can follow your own markup. the only thing is you have to specify your  custom selector while initiating gallery.\n- User can use different  tags including div li span for creating lightGallery markup not only anchor tag.\n  Using html5 data-* attribute also semantic and we can use with any tag. So i feel this approach is better than targeting a particular html tag  \nCustom markup example\nhtml\n<div id=\"lightgallery\">\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"custom-selector\" data-src=\"img1.jpg\">\n            <img src=\"thumb1.jpg\" />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div class=\"custom-selector\" data-src=\"img2.jpg\">\n                <img src=\"thumb2.jpg\" />\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"custom-selector\" data-src=\"img3.jpg\">\n        <img src=\"thumb3.jpg\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\njavascript\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: '.custom-selector'\n});\njsfiddle exapmle : http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/p1aw7utk/15/\n. First of all data-* is a part of html5 and is also semantic. http://www.w3schools.com/ , developer.mozilla.org\nIf we use href instead of data-src we need to force user to use anchor tag with their markup.\nIf we use data-* attribute user can use whatever markup they want \nex\nhtml\n<div>\n    <div data-src=\"larger-imag.jpg\"></div>\n    <div data-src=\"larger-image1.jpg\"></div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n    <li data-src=\"larger-image.jpg\"></li>\n    <li data-src=\"larger-image1.jpg\"></li>\n<ul>\n<div>\n    <a href=\"#\" data-src=\"larger-image.jpg\"></a>\n    <a href=\"#\" data-src=\"larger-image1.jpg\"></a>\n</div>\nSo i think there is no issue with standards. But if using anchor tag and href makes better impact on SEO we can consider using it. \nWhat do you think? is there any other major advantage if we use anchor tag with href?\n. Hi,\nI will use href attribute in the next version with data-src fallback.\nThanks.\n. Hi,\nI have released version 1.2 with this feature..\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thank you very much for your time and effort.. :+1: \n. Ya sure. \nAlready there are lots of issues and pull requests. One by one i will finish all..\n. Hi,\nThank you for your suggestion. \nThere is already a discussion about this. #103. Please join\n. Hi @elyobo ,\nI totally forgot about this pull request. Sorry for that..\nAnd now i am unable to merge the pull request because i have completely re-written the plugin..\nI did not use unnecessary e.stopPropagation(); in the new version..\nThanks..\n. Hi,\nIf you are using animated thumbnails you have to specify thumbWidth in settings. By default thumbWidth is 100px. there is no way to use thumbheight instead of thumbWidth. because all the calculation for animated thumbnails depends on thumbWidth.\nIf you do not want to use animated thumbnails you can modify lightGallery.css however you want.\n. HI, Your question is not perfectly clear to me. \nDo you want to use same markup like <a class=\"zoom-icon fancybox\" title=\"My title\" rel=\"gallery\" href=\"myfullimage.jpg\">Zoom in image</a>.  It would be helpful if you could provide an example for your markup\nThanks.\n. Hi,\nYou can initiate multiple galleries with single call\nex:\nhtml\n<ul id=\"light-gallery\">\n  <li data-src=\"img/img1.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb1.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n  <li data-src=\"img/img2.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb2.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul id=\"light-gallery\">\n  <li data-src=\"img/img3.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb3.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n  <li data-src=\"img/img4.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"img/thumb4.jpg\" />\n  </li>\n</ul>\njavascript\n$('.light-gallery').lightGallery();\n\nhow can I update the gallery with that filtering info ?\n\nAfter filter you can just destroy the gallery and re-initiate it.\nex:\njavascript\nvar gallery =  $('.light-gallery').lightGallery();\n// after filter\ngallery.destroy();\ngallery =  $('.light-gallery').lightGallery();\n. Hi,\nCould you please provide a jsfiddle demo for your setup.. I will try to fix from my side..\n. Hi,\nI am really sorry. I missed your message completely..\nThe link is inactive now. could you do it once again?\n. Hi,\nGallery works fine. The problem is when you filter images isotope is just hiding the images they are not removing images from the dom.\nSo you can just select only visible item as selector.\n``` javascript\nvar gallery =  $(\".gallery\").lightGallery({      \n    selector:'.hotlink:visible',\n    exThumbImage: 'data-exthumbimage'\n}); \n// After filtering \ngallery.destroy();                                  \ngallery = $(\".gallery\").lightGallery({                      \n    selector:'.hotlink:visible',\n    exThumbImage: 'data-exthumbimage'\n});\n```\nPlease let me know if you need the updated files..\n. Hi,\nThank you very mush for your contribution.. But i think this feature is not required now as most people won't use this feature..\nI have released lightgallery version 1.2.0 today. Please have a look at the link and let me know if you have any suggestions.. \n. Hi,\nYou can use exThumbImage setting\n| Name | Expected | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| exThumbImage | string or false | false | If you want to use external image for thumbnail, add the path of that image inside \"data-\" attribute and set value of this option to the name of your custom attribute. |\nEx:\nhtml\n<ul id=\"lightGallery\" class=\"gallery isotope-grid\">\n        <li class=\"isotope-item\"> \n            <figure>\n                <img src=\"../demo_photos/photo1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                <figcaption>\n                    <div class=\"caption-content text-center\">                       \n                        <a data-exthumbimage=\"externalThumb.jpg\" href=\"#\" class=\"hotlink\" data-src=\"../demo_photos/photo1.jpg\"><i class=\"fa fa-pencil fa-2x\"></i></a>\n                    </div>                      \n            </figure>\n        </li>\n</ul>\njavascript\n$(\"#lightGallery\").lightGallery({        \n    selector:'.hotlink',\n    exThumbImage: 'data-exthumbimage'\n});\n. Hi,\nAll the thumbnails will be created while opening the gallery. If we use data-src (full size image ) as thumbnail we need to load all the big size images at a time. lightGallery uses lazy loading to improve performance. so if we load all the big size images together there is no point of setting lazy load feature.\nAnd re-sizing big images into small size doesn't give you good user experience also.\nSo i believe providing separate images for thumbnails is the good practice..\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response.. I missed the pull request..\nI have released new version today including this fix.. \nPlease have a look at the new version and let me know if you have any suggestions..\n. Hi,\nThis is happening because phone is going out of memory when you use large number of high quality images.\nAnimation performance depends on image sizes too. so for ios lightGallery uses left property already instead of css3 transform.\nYou can try using law quality images for iphone by setting responsive-src. Please have a look at this link for more details https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/102#issuecomment-87253283 \n. Hi,\nCurrently this feature is not available.. \nI am working on lightGallery version 1.2.  v1.2 will have swipe/ mouse-drag support for thumbnails.. \n. Hi,\nIt would be helpful if you could provide a jsfiddle demo or a screenshot of your gallery to get a better idea.\nIf your issue is with responsive videos... \nLightGallery has no control over the content inside iframe. You are responsible for that.\nHere is a good article about how to create responsive videos. https://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php\n. Hi,\nYes. What you are doing is correct.\nActually lightGallery is meant for image video galleries. I just added iframe support as an addon.\nWhen iframe is true whatever url you pass inside src will be added into video container.\nIf you are not using videos you can change padding-bottom It does not effect anywhere else.\nYou can change it according to your flash iframe proportion.\nBut i recommend you to add a new class into lightGallery and change the padding-bottom\nSo it won't effect another if you use multiple galleries with videos \n``` javascript\n$('#gal2').click(function(e){\n    $(this).lightGallery({\n        addClass:'has-flash-cont'\n    }); \n}); \n```\ncss\n.has-flash-cont #lg-slider .video {\n    padding-bottom: 76%;\n    /*padding-bottom: 56.25%;*/\n}\n. Hi,\nThis will work fine if you run your demo in any local server like wamp-serve or http-server.\nAnd i think it is not necessary  to change from src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/' to src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/' because if we use first method browser will automatically request the url with appropriate protocol.\nFor ex: If the browser is viewing the page through HTTPS it will request for for src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/' otherwise it will request for src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/'.\nAccording to my knowledge if you add http: in source you may get error when you use gallery on a secure (https) website.\nThank you @boynet for your support..\n. Hi,\nIf you are using dynamic mode you have to pass all the options via dynamicEl. You can use sub-html to pass the captions \nPlease check the updated jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sachin377/msbvspke/2/\nLet me know if you have any queries..\n. Hi,\nCurrently it is not possible. You have to customize lightGallery to pull inline content into iframe.\nThis stackoverflow answer might be helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4199458/specifying-content-of-an-iframe-instead-of-the-src-to-a-page\n. Hi,\nThank you very much for your time and effort.. And sorry for the delayed response.. I was working on the same features in new version (completely re-written) when you submitted the pull request..\nI have already included this features in new version. Please check the new version and let me know if you have any suggestions..\nThanks..\n. Hi,\nI have added zoom support in lightgallery version 1.2.\nPlease check..\n. Hi,\nYou can do this by adding padding bottom for.lg-img-wrap div.. Value of padding bottom should be the height of .lg-sub-html div\ncss\n.lg-outer .lg-img-wrap {\n     padding-bottom: 70px;\n}\n. Hi,\nI have fixed this issue in version 1.2\nThanks ..\n. Hi,\nI have added poster images for videos in new version.. even though if the focus is on playing video we cannot control slide via keyboard shortcuts ..\n. Hi, \nI have included zoom support in version 1.2 please check..\n. Hi,\nI have release lightgallery version 1.2.\nHere you can get more information about supported html markups..\nIf you face any difficulty please let me know..\n. Hi,\nYou have to destroy the plugin and re-initiate it after clicking on load more button.\n``` javascript\nvar gallery = $('#gallery').lightGallery();\n$('#load-more').on('click', function() {\n    gallery.destroy();\n    gallery = $('#gallery').lightGallery();\n});\n```\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response.\nLightgallery just add the html what you proved inside data-sub-hmtl attribute...\nAdding style for your custom html is your responsibility..\nI have included default style for captions in new version.. Please check\n. Hi,\nCurrently this feature is not available.\nI will let you know if i add this feature..\n. Hi,\nYou can use videoMaxWidth for defining the width of the video and change the padding-bottom of .lg-vodeo in (new version) for changing the height of the video..\ncss\n.lg-outer .lg-video {\n    height: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%; // for 16:9 videos\n    position: relative;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n. Hi,\nIn new version you can access all variables of lightgallery via object data attribute..\nAll the gallery elements will be store in $items.. You can refer the code bellow and let me know if you have any doubts..\nex: \nhtml\n<ul id=\"lg\">\n    <li data-videosize=\"widescreen\" id=\"li_X01\" class=\"vitem xtr\">\n       <span class=\"lesson\">Tutorial</span>\n        <a class=\"popup2 widescreen\" href=\"#\" data-src=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OSjWC93gVI\" data-exthumbimage=\"thumbs/X01.png\">\n            <img src=\"/thumbs/X01.png\" />\n        </a>\n    </li>\n<ul>\n``` javascript\nvar $lg = ('#lg');\n   $lg.lightGallery();\n   $lg.on('onBeforeSlide.lg', function(event, prevIndex, index) {\n        console.log($methods.data('lightGallery').$items.eq(index).attr('data-videosize'))\n   });\n```\n.

I have release lightgallery version 1.2.0\nPlease check this issue and re-open if it exists in new version also ..\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response..\nWe can not access cross domain iframe content using javascript..\nClosing the issue..\n. Hi,\nI was in the middle of lighgallery version 1.2.0 development when you submitted the pull request..\nI'd really appreciate if you could do this in the new version and submit a pull request..\nThanks.. \n. Hi,\nThat could be some issue with your css.\nCould you please provide your website url if it is live?\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delay from my side. And thank you very much for your effort and time..\nI have release lightgallery version 1.2 today..  It is modular and we can add more features without increasing the size of the core code.. Could you please add this feature in 1.2.0 video plugin..\nThanks,\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. I have fixed this issue... Please check.\n. Hi, \nLast two weeks i couldn't work on lightgallery due to my exams.. \nHopefully i will be able to release within the next two weeks... Any way you can start using the new version from today itself i wont make much changed in the code..\n. @JohnRSim ,\nSorry i missed your message..\nI have released new version.. Please check..\n. Hi,\nit will work fine if you run it via a webserver locally, such as wamp, xampp, http-server etc..\n. Hi,\nI have included sass files in lightgallery version 1.2.0. Now you can directly import sass files instead of css files..\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response. I have been quite busy lately..\nNormally you can add multiple galleries using class selector\n$('.lightgallery').lightGallery();\nBut i am not sure how your html structure is. It would be helpful if you could share your html markup..\n. Hi,\nI hope your issue has been solved..\n\nDid you check the .light-gallery class?\n\nCould you please explain what you mean by this line?\nI have released lightgallery version 1.2. \nHere you can get more information about different html markups.. \n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response and thank you very much for your contribution. I was in the middle of lightgallery version 1.2 when you submitted the pull request..\nI have released new version today.. And i used on,off instead of bind/unbind..\n. Hi,\nI have fixed this issue... Please check.\n. Hi,\nThank you very much for your detailed information. \nI don't have an ipad to test this issue. It seems like memory issue with the ipad. \nI had tested this issue on ipad earlier and it was happening when i used more than 100 images at a time.\nIt was happening because of css transitions. I am using only position, scale, rotation and opacity properties for animations which browser can animate easily without any problem. Then i tried with css left property instead of translate and it worked fine. I have added useLeft setting for forcing lightgallery to use left transition instead of translate. \nPlease check this issue once again with useLeft: true and let me know.\nIf still it is happening please try to use minimal settings (without thumbnail, autoplay.. etc).\n. Hi,\nPlease re-open the issue if it still exist...\nThanks\n. https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/188#issuecomment-150906371\n. Hi,\nDid you see the http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/comment-box.html demo?\nInstead of fb comments you can also add custom html including detailed information about the picture..\nIf you have any feature suggestion please post it in the comment section..\nThanks\n. Hi,\nYou can use zoom +/- icons for changing the zoom value of the image..\nI will add double-tap and pinch-zoom for the mobile devices soon..\nCould you please add this in the comment section as a feature request. So i can work on new features according to the up votes..\nThanks.. \n. Hi,\nI am actually confused about this.. Could you please add this suggestion in the comment section so we can decide it according to the number of votes..\nThanks..\n. First of all, I can not consider this as a bug. \nI tried without scrollbar in the beginning of development and it was giving some flickering effect while opening the gallery. That is why I decided to keep scrollbar as it is...\nYou can just google jquery lightbox gallery and check some lightbox galleries. Most of them retain the scrollbar.\nThank you for your suggestions and contributions so far..\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. I have fixed this issue..\n. Yes it is possible. Here is the demo http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/captions.html\n. Currently it is not possible. but you can preload external comments in a hidden div and load into lightgallery by giving the id or classname of your hidden div inside data-sub-html attribute..\nIf you have any feature suggestion please post it in the comment section.. \n. Hi,\nYou can double-click on the image to see its actual size. Use zoom plus/minus icon to increase/decrease the zoom value. you can change scale' value from the settings.. Please post your opinion in the [comment](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/#other-projects) section. So we can decide it according to the up votes..\n. Could you please explain what you mean bychoosen`. Currently when you doubleclick on image it will display in its actual size..\n. @shawnye Currently this feature is not available. But you can try something like what @smartcorestudio suggested..\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. Html files are in the gh-pages branch.\nI'd really if you could submit a pull request for this..\nThanks.\n. Lightgallery is divided into small modules, such as thumbnails, full screen, zoom, etc.\nSo you don't have to include unwanted code in your document. Include only relevant modules..\nIt is easy to create your own modules. Here you can find basic structure of lightgallery module.\nI am not well aware of amd modules any help with this would be much appreciated..\nThanks..\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Hi,\nWe can hide controls by passing controls: false via settings.\n``` javascript\n// Detect touch screen devices \nvar isTouch = 'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints;\n// Hide controls if isTouch is true \n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    controls: isTouch ? false : true\n});\n``\n. :+1: \n. Hi,\nIs this just closing the gallery or completely crashing the browser? \nIt works just fine in my android phone. \nAny help with this issue would be much appreciated because i don't have an iphone to test this issue.. \n. I believe this is because of css animations. Could you please passuseLeft: truevia settings and test this once again. So lightgallery will use left property instead of translate for animations\n. https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/188#issuecomment-150906371\n. Yes. You have to uselg-slidefor slide transition.\n[Here](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/transitions.html) is the demo for multiple transitions\n. Oh, thank you pointing this out..\nI have updated the docs..\n. Hi,\nYou can use.lg-thumb-open` class for this purpose. It is already available.\ncss\n.lg-thumb-open .lg-img-wrap {\n    padding-bottom: 100px;\n}\n. Hi,\nIs there any issue with jquery version 1.7.0 ?\n. Hi guys,\nFor current use please refer the stack overflow post\nI will add a demo when i get time..\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks :+1: \n. I have merged your pull request.\nThanks..\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Hi,\nI had plan to add multiple themes for lightgallery. But couldn't add because of lack of time..\nI have removed themes link from the website. I will try to add few more themes if i get time..\n. Hi,\nThis could be issue with selector.\nIf you want to open gallery from single tag you can just pass selector:'this' via settings.\njavascript\n$('.lightgallery').lightGallery({\n        selector: 'this'\n});\nPlease let me know if you still face any difficulty.. \n. did you include lg-video.js in your document?\nIt would be helpful if you could provide a jsfiddle demo for your setup..\n. The issue has been fixed..\nThanks..\n. Hi,\nI have fixed this issue. On first escape key press lightgallery will close it's thumbnails and gallery will be closed on second escape key press if thumbnail is already opened. Otherwise gallery will be closed on first escape key press..\n. Hi guys,\nI have added the above css provided by @smartcorestudio if toggleThumb is false and animateThumb is true.\n. It works fine for me. which version of firefox do you use?\n. It works fine for me on firefox 40.0.3 .\nIf any issue is there that could be with jQuery mouse wheel plugin. Because i have not written much code for mouse wheel support. \n. I think you are missing the jQuery mousewheel  plugin.. (I forgot to mention in the docs also.. Sorry for that..)\nIt is required for cross browser support because javascript mousewheel and DOMMouseScroll events are not standard yet..\n@MarcosBL Thank you for time and effort.. I have also fixed the scrolling issue which you have mentioned..\n. Hi,\nBy default data-src/href attribute should be provided to the direct child elements.So either you can provide data-src/href attribute for the li or change the selector object via settings\njavascript\n$('#selector1').lightGallery({\n    selector: 'li a '\n})\n. Thank you for pointing this out..\nI have fixed this issue..\n. Hi,\nThanks for the video. The issue has been fixed.\n. Hi,\nThe issue has been fixed in 1.2.4..\nThank you for bringing this up.. :+1: \n. HI,\nVersion 1.2 was completely re-written..\nHere you can find old version docs http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/1.1-docs/ \n. Hi,\nYou can try appending the lightgallery templates and backdrop into your div instead of body.\n. Hi,\nI have made few updates on lightgallery.. Please check and re-open the issue if it still exist..\n. Hi @jochienabuurs,\nIt is clear that the issue is with css transform. Could you please test this once again with settings startClass: '', useLeft: true.So Lightgallery will avoid the zoom animation while opening each image.\nPlease let me know if there are any improvements. Otherwise as you suggested i will have to change the structure of lightgallery and keep only three images/videos at a time inside the gallery..\n. Thanks @MattXcz,\nI don't have an ipad to check this issue.. Could you please check this once again with startClass: '', useLeft: true. Also please disable thumbnails and pager options..\n. Hi,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lightgallery.\nI have checked this issue on iphone6 (iOS v9.0.2) and works fine with more than 500 images..\n\n. Hi,\nI have updated the docs. It was a typo :)\nCurrently selector for captions feature is not available. I will let you know if i include this feature..\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. The issue has been fixed..\n. Hi, \nCurrently i don't have a demo for this. But you can try including the buttons inside data-html attribute..\n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out..\nI have fixed this issue..\n. Hi,\nonClose event is already available but i forgot to update in docs..\nHere is the updated docs for events\n. It works fine for me. Could you please explain on which browser and when the issue happened? \n. Ya sure. I will add it when i get time.\n. Hi Guys,\nI've added share module.\nGitHub: https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-share\nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/share.html\nDocs: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-share\n. Thanks :+1: \n. The issue has been fixed https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/releases/tag/1.3.9. Hi,\nIn this situation no need to set any custom selector property. Here you can find more details about custom selectors..\nYou can use the following code..\njavascript\n$('.links').lightGallery();\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response. The issue has already been fixed. Please use latest version of lightgallery..\n. Hi,\nI have updated the docs. Please check http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#events\n. Hi,\nThank you for your time and effort.. \nI think to avoid the flickering effect while toggling the download icon instead of toggling we can just disable it. What is your opinion on this?..\n. Hi,\nThere were few issues with the download button. I have fixed all those issues in vesion 1.2.11. Also you can pass false via data-download-url for hiding download icon for any particular slide..\nOnce again thank you very much for your support so far..\n.

Hi,\nYou need to include the hash plugin (lg-hash.js) in your document to get this feature..\nIn the demo it is not working just because i did not include hash plugin in the document..\nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-hash\n. Thank you :+1: \n. Hi,\nThank you for your effort and time.\nI think we are not at all using any jquery functions with $items in dynamic mode. Could you please explain when did you get error with $items?\n. Thank you for pointing this out..\nBut under any circumstance gallery will not work if dynamicEl is empty in dynamic mode. So i think instead of checking for dynamicEl  everywhere check it in the beginning of the code and exit if  it is empty to avoid javascript error. \nSomething like this..\n``` javascript\nthis.s = $.extend({}, defaults, options);\nif (this.s.dynamic && !this.s.dynamicEl.length) {\n    return;\n}\n```\nWhat do you think?..\n. It would be helpful if you could modify your pull request..\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Hi Guys,\nThe basic functionality is already done - https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lg-comment/demos/methods.html\nWill be released in version 2.0. Hey @piemme74,\nVersion 2.0 is still under development. The problem you pointed out is a known issue. You need to change some settings to make this work. . You need to set zoomFromImage: false. Please do not use the demo version for production. It has few known issues . Yes, it is possible. Docs - https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html\njs\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    share: false,\n    download: false\n});. Hi Guys,\nFinally, the issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lightGallery\nThank you so much for your patience . Hey @d1a8lo24 ,\nApologies for the delay. :disappointed: \nIt is not an issue of lightGallery. Users must load their assets with the appropriate protocol. As you pointed out using // is a good workaround because then the browser will automatically request the URL with the appropriate protocol. . Related to #488 . Works fine for me. Please re-open if the issue persists . Thanks :+1: \n. Hey Guys,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lightGallery and its modules.\nSorry for the delay :(. Hi guys,\nThe issue has been fixed in v1.2.11. You can pass data-download-url=\"false\" for hiding download icon for any particular slide.\n. Hi @reillo ,\nAt present, it is not possible. But, I'll try to include a refresh method in future. Thank you guys for pointing this out. I never experienced such an issue(I use grunt). Would anybody interested to submit a pull request? \n. Hi,\nThank you for pointing this out. It is a bug.\nFor current use change lg-video.js line no 57 to \njavascript\nif ($el.find('.lg-object').hasClass('lg-has-poster') && $el.find('.lg-object').is(':visible')) {\nI have been quite busy lately i will update it once i get time..\n. The issue has been fixed 4ff464c0b702cb9cfede8e729d8acdec829655aa\n. Issue has been fixed . Since there is only one item in the gallery, navigation arrows are useless. That is why it is removed.. Hey Guys,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of video plugin.. HI,\nA couple of points.\n-  touch alias for Modernizr.touchevents is  removed from Modernizr version 3.0.  https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/941\n- I think i can create a build of Modernizr without touch events support.. In that case result will be false  event if the device supports touch events.\n- Instead of checking for Modernizr we can directly use a correct method in lightgallery. http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/  https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/a23193bf25387ccca63a05e8c74d54ec1b458c5c/feature-detects/touchevents.js\n- And finally there are few jshint issues in your code https://travis-ci.org/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/builds/93165405\nOnce again thank you for your support and contribution so far.. \n. Hey Guys,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lightGallery.. You need to set selector property to the element which is providing the data-html property. \nIn your case, the following code should work.\nhtml\n<div class=\"selector\" data-poster=\"{{video.thumb}}\" data-sub-html=\"video caption1\" data-html=\"#video{{video.id}}\"  >\n                  <!-- Hidden video div -->\n                  <img src=\"{{video.thumb}}\" />\n              </div>\n``` javascript\n.directive('videolightbox', function(){\n        return {\n            restrict: 'C',\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n                if (scope.$last) {\n                element.parent().lightGallery({\n                    enableTouch: true,\n                    selector: '.selector',\n                    thumbnail: true,\n                    keypress:true,\n                    scale: 1,\n                    showThumbByDefault:true,\n                    videojs: true\n                }); \n            }   \n        }\n    }\n})\n\n``. Hi guys,\nThe issue has been fixed in https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/commit/2c9d01e6f0578532ae01fcbe7b0b63b3d4e1cf41.

Hey guys,\nThe issue has been fixed.. @thdoan,\nThank you for pointing this out.. The issue has been fixed..\n@kursusHC , Thank you very much for all your contributions so far.. I have been quite busy lately. Not even getting time to look at the issue.. Hope you will continue to support the project.. :+1: \n. Oh forgot to mention.. \nWhen you doubleclick on the image it will be zoomed to it's actual pixel. For normal zoom-in, zoom-out you can use the top buttons. If you know the actual size of the image it is better to pass it via data-width attribute. For dynamic gallery you can use width key. If you don't know the actual size of the image no need to pass anything lightgallery will try to find it's actual size. But keep in mind some old browsers don't support naturalWidth property. So i would prefer the first method.. \njavascript\ndynamicEl: [\n    {\n        src: 'path-to-image/image.jpg',\n        width: 1600\n    }\n]\n. Hey @chelseanderby ,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. Since the issue was reported long back, I hope you must have found the solution. If not, please summarize your problems and re-open the issue.. Hey @kursusHC,\nThe following code should work fine.\njs\n$('.button').on('click', function() {\n  $(this).lightGallery({\n    dynamic: true,\n    dynamicEl: galleryArray\n  })\n})\n$('.button').on('onAfterOpen.lg',function(event){\n// Do stuff\n});.

You have to follow the same folder structure to get the fonts work. If it is possible, loading CSS files from CDN would be the best option I think.\nOtherwise, you have to upload files individually and override font path via CSS..

Hi,\nI have included this feature in version 1.2.17\n. Thanks.. :+1: \n. Please use the latest version of lightGallery. Closing old support questions.. Thank you so much for your contribution. \nBut i think we don't need an additional option as we can easily do this by setting selector to this\njavascript\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: 'this'\n});\n. I would prefer to make two function call with id instead of calling it via single class.\nInside the lightgallery function it is going through all elements in the dom and assigning lightgallery function to all the elements with the same class. It is a slow process. \nIn the case of id, it is supposed to be unique, so the API stops searching after the ID is found in the DOM.\nAs far as i know using id is the preferred method in this scenario. What do you think?\nhttps://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/blob/master/src/js/lightgallery.js#L1292\n. Added to my todo list :). https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lg-comment/demos/methods.html Will be released in version 2.0. Hi,\nI have never worked with openlayers3. But to get video instead of image you can use the video url from youtube address bar.\nI would suggest you to ask this question on stackoverflow. Someone who has experience with openlayers3 might help you.\n. Hi,\nYou can double click on the images to see the actual size of the images. Any way i will add an icon on the toolbar for zooming images to it's actual size..\n. Hi,\nI have added an icon on the toolbar to view the actual size of the image(100%). \nPlease use the latest version\n. Hi,\nYou need to destroy the gallery before adding new items..\nPlease refer the bellow link\nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\n.

Hey @b2bstudio ,\nYes, it is possible. You just need to pass thumbnail: false via settings \njs\n$('lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    thumbnail: false\n});. Hi Guys,\nAs per my understanding autoplay cannot be done on iOS devices. User has to manually click on the video.

Please feel free to re-open if you guys think it is possible.. Hi,\nThank you so much for your contribution. \nBut does it really make the code faster. As far as i know selecting element via id is the fastest way. Setting unique id for each caption is not a difficult thing in any scenario.\nAnd i think inside the find function jquery uses querySelectorAll to select the elements. Additionally we need to read the value of data-sub-html-self even though caption is passed directly to the data-sub-html attribute \nWhat do you think? \nI tried to test the performance on https://jsperf.com/. But it is currently unavailable due to maintenance.. \n. Hi guys,\nI am aware of the performance difference between directly accessing element via this.$items.eq(index) and storing the reference in a variable and using it when we use the same element multiple times. I followed this wherever is possible. But definitely missed in many places. I can see few more example where i can improve the quality of the code. But as you can see there are 100 plus open issues on github and i really don't have much time to work on it.\nIn my opinion passing id instead of class is not a big deal. Any way i am happy to merge this PR if it is useful for many people.\nI think in most cases markup structure will be same for a gallery so we can pass it as an option instead of data-attribute. see #335 .\n. I have made all the changes and released new version 1.2.20.\n. Related to https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/547. Thanks :+1: \n. Closing old support questions .

Thank you for reporting this issue . \nJust release v1.2.21 with the fix.\n. Hey @cph2,\nCould you please provide a jsfiddle demo which demonstrates the issue?. Hey @dayomu,\nThe issue is related to https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/581. At present share plugin doesn't work with dynamic mode. FOr current use, either you can disable the dynamic mode or the share plugin. It is a major issue and will be fixed in the next release . I think autoplay should not be passed via player params. If you pass {autoplay: 1} via player params all the videos inside the gallery will start playing together. Maybe as @Leapfrognz suggested, we can add an option to control autoplay from settings. \nlightGallery automatically enables autoplay for the first video if the poster doesn't exist. but there is no option to control remaining videos autoplay.\n. Hope the above answer fixes the issue.\nThank u @franata . Hey @svkmedia ,\nThe current approach works fine on small resolutions as well. Please re-open the issue if it doesn't work for you.. Hey @br3ach3r ,\nSorry for the delayed response. It seems like the issue with your code. Since it is an old ticket, I hope you must have found the solution. Please re-open if the issue persists .

Hi @Enzo-bianchi,\nlightGallery loads thumbnails only inside the gallery. If you want to load youtube thumbnails outside the gallery, you can follow @mhrnik's approach . Hi Guys,\nThis option is already available. you just need to pass fs:0 in youtubePlayerParams setting\njavascript\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    youtubePlayerParams: {\n      fs: 0\n    }\n});\nDemo: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MJGMQd\nYouTube API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters\nDocs: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-video\nBTW: @SANTOSHKVNSP shoot me an email @ sachi77n@gmail.com if you'd like to contribute \n. Hey @paul-hansen ,\nSince it is very easy to achieve via CSS, I'd like to keep it as it is.\nBut, if we get more requests to add a setting for backdrop opacity, I'll consider adding it in the future.\n. By default, download URL will be taken from data-src/href attribute but it supports only for modern browsers.

Which version of lightgallery are you using?\n. Hi @Shaker-Hamdi,\nThanks for the clarification. It's because of the poor CSS3 animation performance on iPhone. \nAnyway, I'll ty to find a solution\n. Previously I was using translate instead of top and left, and I had the issue on desktop firefox and chrome.\nI think @makshh's solution would be fine. We can detect iPhone and apply translate instead of top and left.\nI don't have an iPhone to test this. Any help with this issue would be much appreciated. \n. Thank you guys. \nI am currently on vacation. I'll check this code on all devices once I'm back\n. Hi Guys,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. I've been super busy lately. \nFor me, the issue was happening only on chrome v53 when is use CSS transform. It was working fine when I use CSS left property. \nI've released a new version of lg-zoom with a new setting useLeftForZoom - If the value of useLeftForZoom is true CSS left property will be used for animation. Otherwise , CSS transform will be used. It is true by default on chrome V53 and false on all the other browsers.\nPlease use the latest version of lg-zoom and lightgallery.css. Also please let me know if the problem persists.. justifiedGallery is used to create the thumbnails on lightGallery demo page  - http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/.

Hi,\nI am sorry for the delayed response. We need to change the class name in the lg-thumbnails.js also. I've moved thumbnails module to another repo. The changes need to be done in that repository. I'll do it myself \n. No, At present, lightGallery does not support multiple images in one slide. At present, lightGallery doesn't support sprite images for thumbnails. And it already uses the lazy loading for main images. By default, lightGallery loaded only 3 images. Remaining images will be loaded as you navigate to other slides.. Hi @jksenthilraja,\nSorry for not responding to your query. Hope you fixed it.\n@lapDog, \nI think the issue is because of the wrong markup you have.

Hey @Mahopacs ,\nlightGallery is not fully compactable with audios. But, as @vitoravale suggested, you can use videoJs for current use.. You can get the current index on onBeforeSlide.lg event. \nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#events\nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/events.html\n. Hi @codealchemist,\nThank you for your time and effort. I am not sure how feasible this solution is. It might break lightgallery modules and other functionalities.\nAnyway, this can be done easily by using lightgallery methods. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\n. I think you are calling destroy method when the gallery is open. In this case, you have to check the open state of the gallery and call destroy method only if the gallery is not open. \nThen listen for lightgallery close event and destroy and re-initialize if new items are added to the list.\nSomething like this \n``` javascript\nvar $el= $('#el');\nvar destroyGallery = false;\nvar slide = '' +\n    '' +\n'';\n$el.lightGallery();\n$('#appendSlide').on('click', function() {\n    $el.append(slide);\n// Gallery is open\nif($('body').hasClass('lg-on')) {\n    destroyGallery = true;\n} else {\n    $el.data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\n    $el.lightGallery();\n}\n\n});\n$el.on('onCloseAfter.lg', function(){\n    if (destroyGallery) {\n        $el.data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\n        $el.lightGallery();\n        destroyGallery = false;\n    }\n});\n```\n. Hi,\nHere is the demo for videos with 'Automatically load thumbnails'. http://codepen.io/sachinchoolur/pen/XNavPP\n. It loads only thumbnails inside the gallery. lightGallery does not have control over the thumbnails on your page.\n\n. Hi Guys,\nPlease use the latest version of lg-zoom.js. It is now jQuery 3.0 compatible.\nThanks :)\n. Hi,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. Here is the demo YouTube, Vimeo videos  http://codepen.io/sachinchoolur/pen/XNavPP. Hi,\nIt works fine for me. Could you please post a screenshot of your gallery?\n. I am currently on vacation. I can not test it on safari now. \nCould you please run the following code on safari to check fullscreen browser support.\njavascript\n// check fullscreen browser support\n  if (!document.fullscreenEnabled && !document.webkitFullscreenEnabled &&\n     !document.mozFullScreenEnabled && !document.msFullscreenEnabled) {\n           alert('Your browser does not support fullscreen mode!')\n     }\n. Sorry for the delay. So Safari 5.1.7 does not support fullscreen mode. :). Hi @macsupport ,\nI was also thinking about this :) I got few other emails too regarding the pricing.\nI've updated the price. Now you don't need to purchase separate license for each lightgallery modules. Once you purchase a lightgallery commercial license you can use all lightgallery modules for free.\n. Hi @makshh, \nSorry that line is not very clear. \nYou can use lightGallery \"as part\" of another product (which can be sold on marketplaces), but it can't be a copy of lightGallery, or lightGallery can't be the main component of the product. \n. Make sure that you have included lightgallery.js in your document.\nYou can refer dynamic mode demo here\n. Hi,\nAll lightGallery plugins are available on https://www.jsdelivr.com/?query=lightgallery. Thank you for pointing this out.\n I've fixed the issue. Please use the latest version \n. lightgallery should work fine with echo.js. Please provide a jsfiddle demo if you are still having trouble with echo.js\n. @JSteunou, \nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. Could you please provide an example, when this feature is useful? \n. @JSteunou, \nI'm sorry, I think it is a very rare scenario and this feature won't be useful for most of the users.\nThank you so much for your contributions and guidance so far. \n. 1.3.5 is the latest version. I'll update the website.\n. Do you mean the minified versions of lightGallery? If yes, it works fine for me. Please check the codepen demo http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zKEvVG\nOtherwise, it might be some issues with your app. Make sure that you are calling lightgallery.js before its plugins. \n. You can use setting controls:false to hide the navigation arrows.\njavascript\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    controls: $(window).width() >= 768\n });\n. You are using different versions of lightGallery CSS and javascript.\nVersion lightgallery-all.min.js on your website is  v1.2.22. I couldn't find which version of lightgallery.css you are using, but I'm sure that it is not v1.2.22.\nPlease use the latest version of lightGallery (Both JS and CSS). It will work fine.\n. All plugins are separate packages now. You can install the plugins using bower or npm\nBower\nsh\n$ bower install lightgallery lg-thumbnail lg-video lg-pager lg-hash lg-autoplay lg-fullscreen lg-share lg-video\nNPM\nsh\n$ npm install lightgallery lg-thumbnail lg-video lg-pager lg-hash lg-autoplay lg-fullscreen lg-share lg-video\nOr you can directly download from github repositories\n. Just add the following lines of  CSS into your document. \ncss\nul {\n    list-style-type: none;\n}\n. Hi,\nlightGallery version 1.2.x It is completely free to use for personal projects, as well as commercial based projects. But you need to purchase a commercial license if you want use lighGallery version 1.3.0 or higher for commercial use.\n. FYI: You can always use GPL software in commercial based projects. But you must make the source code of the project available for the users.\n. Hey @Jesperanza,\nYes, you need to buy a license to use lightGallery on those websites. As you need to use the script on multiple sites, the extended commercial license would be the appropriate license.\nlet me know if you have any queries  . Yes exactly. :) \n. Hi @Saboteur777,\nI'm sorry for the delayed response. I'll include this when I release next major patch version. Otherwise, it might break apps which use third party tools like Wiredep.\n. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response.\nI think it is not an issue with lightGallery. \nFirst of all, you are using different versions of lightgallery.js and css. Use latest versions of lightgallery.js and lightgallery.css\nSecondly, load your javascript files at the bottom of the page and initiate lightGallery once dom is ready.\njavascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('#lightgallery').lightGallery();\n});\nLet me know if you need any further explanation. \n. Sorry for the delayed response. I was on vacation.\nYou need to change .lg-backdrops background image on before each slide transition.\nJavascript\n``` javascript\n  var $lightgallery = $('#lightgallery');\n  $lightgallery.lightGallery();\n  var data = $lightgallery.data('lightGallery');\n$lightgallery.on('onBeforeSlide.lg', function(event, prevIndex, index){\n    var img = data.$items.eq(index).attr('data-src');\n    $('.lg-backdrop').css('background-image', 'url('+img+')');\n  });\n```\nCSS\ncss\n.lg-backdrop {\n  -webkit-filter: blur(50px);\n  -moz-filter: blur(50px);\n  -o-filter: blur(50px);\n  -ms-filter: blur(50px);\n  filter: blur(50px);  \n}\nDEMO: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/YGLYoy\n. You can change overlay color on lightGallery onBeforeSlide.lg event \nDemo : http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/events.html\n. Hi,\nI'm sorry, I didn't understand your question properly. What is the difference between Base64 Decoded image and a normal image? I guess you want to use base 64 encoded image string with lightgallery. In that case, you can directly pass the image string via data-src attribute. \n. You have to include lg-zoom.js in your document.\nhttps://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-zoom\n. It works fine for me. You have to click on the play icon to resume the videos. And make sure that your captions are not hiding the play icon. Hi,\nMethod 1:\nUse lightGallery dynamic mode \nDemo : http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/dynamic.html\nMethod 2:\nTrigger click event with jQuery :\njavascript\n$('#mybutton').on('click', function() {\n   $('.first-item').trigger('click');\n});\n. Hi Ravi,\nNo, Currently there is no way to add more images without calling the destroy method.\nI will consider adding a refresh method in the future.\n. Hi Karthik,\nCurrently, it is not possible to load multiple video in single div.\nYou can either pass id or class name of your hidden div which contain the video via data-html attribute or directly pass the video html via data-html attribute.\nDemo : http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html5-videos.html\n. Hi,\nsorry for the delayed response. Instead of the above code, you can directly pass index while initializing lightGallery\njavascript\n    $(this).lightGallery({ \n        dynamic: true, \n        dynamicEl: $galleryJson, \n        index: $currentSlide;\n    })\n. Thank you. :+1: \n. Hey @andrewf10,\nAt present, this feature is not available. Watch the repository, I'll include this feature when I get time. No, Not yet. Planing for version 2.0. Sorry for the delayed response, All plugins are moved to separate repositories since version 1.3.\nhttps://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery#built-in-modules\n. @fendorio,\nIt works fine for me. Which version of Android/Chromium do you use?. I use the same version and it works fine. Could you, please check the demo website on chrome? http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html5-videos.html. You can use the bellow format to add html5 videos. \njavascript\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n  dynamic: true,\n  dynamicEl: [{\n    thumb: '../static/img/thumb-1.jpg',\n    html: '<video class=\"lg-video-object lg-html5\" controls preload=\"none\"><source src=\"../static/videos/video1.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support HTML5 video</video>'\n    }]\n})\nDocs: \nhttps://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#dynamic\nhttps://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html5-videos.html\n. Hi,\nI'm sorry, I'll update the docs. All lightGallery plugins are separate packages now. https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery#built-in-modules\nYou can either directly download from respective GitHub repositories or using package managers such as bower or npm\nYou don't have to purchase separate license for that, It is free if you have a lightGallery license. \nPlease let me know if you need any further information.\n. Hi \nIt's because Facebook is not considering # as a part of the URL.\nThe solution is to create dedicated pages for each of your images and pass the url it via lightGallery  data-facebook-share-url. \nThese pages should contain your image and its description.\nhtml\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"your-image.jpg\" />\nPlease refer the following post for more info\nhttps://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=10200814000150949. Hi,\nSorry for the delayed response. Just remove href attribute from the  video  anchor tag . It will work fine.\nhtml\n<div id=\"lightgallery\">\n<a data-poster=\"v_projet001.jpg\" data-html=\"#video1\" title=\"Film\"><img src=\"v_projet001.jpg\"></a>\n<a href=\"v_20151115_1320-DSC_1709.Challenge.de.La.Pirouette.jpg\" title=\"Coucou\"><img src=\"v_20151115_1320-DSC_1709.Challenge.de.La.Pirouette.jpg\"></a>\n</div>\n\ndata-src and 'href' should not be provided when you use html5 videos \n. Hey Guys,\n\nWordpress version of lightGallery is now available. https://dzine.io/products/lightgallery-wp-plugin/. Hi,\nlightGallery zoom plugin does not work in IE8 as it uses css3 transform. I'll Update the docs. \n. Thank you for pointing this out! I've fixed the issue. Please use latest version\n. Hi,\nIt is because newly added images are not indexed by lightGallery. Try the bellow code. \njavascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  var $lg = $( '#lightGallery');\n  $lg.lightGallery();\n  $lg.on( 'cycle-update-view', function( event, opts ) {\n    $lg.data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\n    $lg.lightGallery(); \n  });\n  $lg.on( 'onBeforeOpen.lg', function() {\n       $('.cycle-slideshow').cycle('pause');\n    });\n  $lg.on( 'onBeforeClose.lg', function() {\n     $('.cycle-slideshow').cycle('resume');\n  });\n});\nHere is the working demo https://jsfiddle.net/sachi77/hg2p81h1/5/\n. All lightGalery plugins are available on jsdelivr. https://www.jsdelivr.com/?query=lightgallery\n. Yes, You are right. It works only if thumbnails are greater than the screen width.\nBut you can easily center the thumbnails block by adding the following CSS code into your document \ncss\n.lg-outer .lg-thumb-outer {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n.lg-outer .lg-thumb  {\n  display: inline-block\n}\nDemo : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NbrMyG\n. By default, captions are appended into .lg-sub-html div once the transition to the particular slide is done. But you can append captions directly into each slide by passing {appendSubHtmlTo: .lg-item}. In this case, captions will stay with the image.\nIf you want captions to be appended into .lg-sub-html and show before completing the transition, just remove the setTimeout function from lightgallery.js line no 789 https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/blob/master/src/js/lightgallery.js#L789. Related to https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/155. You can't set X-Frame-Options on the iframe. That is a response header set by the domain from which you are requesting the resource. However, for displaying YouTube/Vimeo videos you don't have to set data-iframe= true. Just pass the video url via data-src attribute. lightGallery will check the data-src attribute and if it is YouTube or Vimeo video URL, it will create a video iframe.\nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/videos.html\n. It is not possible with default settings. By default, lightGallery inserts HTML markup into body. You can just find and replace $('body') to $(yourContainer).\nAlso, add the following CSS into your document to get proper alignment\ncss\nyourContainer {\n  position: relative;\n}\n.lg-backdrop {\n  position: absolute;\n}\n.lg-outer {\n  position: absolute;\n}\n.lg-outer .lg-item, .lg-outer .lg-img-wrap, .lg-outer .lg-video-cont {\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  right: 0;\n}\n.lg-sub-html {\n  position: absolute\n}\nHere is the demo: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZByYwP. Hi @floaespe,\nI'm sorry, but I did not understand your question properly. Could you rephrase it?. You can use exThumbImage setting. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-thumbnial\nBy default, lightGallery takes thumbnails images from the selector. In your case, it is not available as it loads via lazy load plugin. so you can pass the original image via any data-* attribute and pass the attribute via exThumbImage setting\nhtml\n<li data-exthumbimage=\"img/example.jpg\" data-src=\"img/img1.jpg\">\n    <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"img/example.jpg\" width=\"80\" height=\"120\" alt=\"\">\n</li>\njs\n  $('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    exThumbImage: 'data-exthumbimage'    \n  });\nLet me know if you need any further explanation.. It should be given to the selector. \nhtml\n<div id=\"lightgallery\" class=\"grid-container\">\n    <div class=\"grid-item\">\n        <a href=\"images/city-architecture/4-1600.jpg\" data-exthumbimage=\"images/city-architecture/4-480.jpg\">\n            <img data-original=\"images/city-architecture/4-480.jpg\" class=\"lazy\" width=\"345px\" height=\"230px\" />\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>. Hi,\nI'll add rotate button when I get time.\nRelated to https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/245. Thank you for pointing this out. I've fixed the issue, please use the latest version of share plugin . Hi Guys,\nYes, it is possible. You need to destroy lightGallery and reinitiate it after appending new images to the list. \nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html. @jimblue It is really awesome :)\nOf course, I'll be happy to review your code. You can email me at sachi77n@gmail.com . It works fine for me. Which animation are you using? . Are you talking about the background color of control(Next/Prev) buttons?\nIf yes try adding the following css in your document \ncss\n.lg-actions .lg-next, .lg-actions .lg-prev {\n    background-color: transparent;\n}. I think it is not an issue of lightGallery. But if you can provide your source code I'll try to help you . Hi @Scarwolf,\nI've sent you an email. closing as it is not an issue of lightGallery.. Hi @Pierre-M,\nTo avoid this issue, you can easily wrap your title with a <span> tag \nFor example\nuse \nhtml\n<a href=\"your-img.png\" data-sub-html=\"<span>#your title</span>\">\ninstead of \nhtml\n<a href=\"your-img.png\" data-sub-html=\"#your title\">\nLet me know if you need a working demo. Hi @jksenthilraja ,\nPlease check the bellow link on your browser and let me know the result.\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/dvzwNe. Hi guys,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lg-zoom and lightgallery.css. Hi @Vortelf,\nIt is not an issue of lightGallery. The bellow StackOverflow post might help you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22183859/javascript-err-content-length-mismatch. Hi @srajaee ,\nThank you so much for the PR. However, there were few minor issues.  I borrowed some logic from your PR and fixed it myself.\nThank you so much for your time and effort . Hi,\nI think it is because the contextmenu event is not getting attached to dynamically added elements(images).\nTry to use the following code. \njavascript\n$('body').on('contextmenu', 'img', function(e){\n    e.preventDefault();\n});. Hi @guiferrpereira,\nThank you for the PR. But, I think autoplay should be controlled from settings. Otherwise, if you pass {autoplay :1} via settings all the videos will start playing together. \nI'm thinking of adding two more options to the settings\n\nautoplyFirstVideo - default : true - enable/disable autoplay option for the first video\nautoplayVideoOnSlide - default : false - enable/disable autoplay option on each slide change\n\nWhat do you think ?. Hey Guys,\nI've added option autoplayFirstVideo to manage the autoplay of the first video. Please use the latest version of lg-video.js\n@guiferrpereira, Closing the PR. I'll introduce autoplayVideoOnSlide if we get more feature request on the same. Thank you so much for your time and effort . Hey @chrispcb,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lightGallery . Hi @yacoob,\nSorry, the documentation for data-sub-html attribute was not very clear. I've updated it\nThis happens only when data-sub-html is not available. In that case, as a fallback captions are fetched from alt or title. If you are using data-sub-html you can easily wrap your caption with a <span> tag to avoid the issue \nHere is the updated demo http://jsfiddle.net/g0dghhmv/9/\nRelated to : https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/509\nI think it is a very rare scenario and we have a few ways to solve the problem. \n. Hi @whimsicaldreamer,\nYes, there was some transition performance issues on chrome. It is fixed now.\nPlease use the latest version of lg-zoom and lightgallery.css. Oh... Let me check the issue on EDGE. lightGallery already supports 'tap to zoom' option. But, it only zooms to the actual size of the image.. Hey @whimsicaldreamer ,\nAt present, this is not possible. I'll let you know if I add this feature.. Hi @kasianchuk,\nYes, it is possible. You can add those attributes on onAferAppendSlide.lg event\njavascript\n  var $lg = $('#lightgallery');\n  $lg.lightGallery();\n  var core = $lg.data('lightGallery');\n  $lg.on('onAferAppendSlide.lg', function(event, index){\n      var _alt = core.$items.eq(index).find('img').attr('alt');\n      var _dataSrc = core.$items.eq(index).find('img').attr('data-src');\n      $('.lg-item').eq(index).find('.lg-image').attr('alt', _alt).attr('data-src', _dataSrc);\n  });\nDemo : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vyvoxj. Hi @faridulhassan,\nI'm glad that you like lightGallery.\nlightGallery is meant for image and video galleries. It is not really compatible for displaying HTML content. . Hi @rjgux,\nThank you for pointing this out. The issue has been fixed. \nPlease use the latest version of lg-zoom. Hi @msherax ,\nMake sure that you have included Vimeo player API (https://f.vimeocdn.com/js/froogaloop2.min.js ) in your document. \nIt is required to pause the video programmatically \nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/videos.html. Hi @jackmu95 ,\nThank you so much for the PR. However, there were few issues. I've fixed #213 myself . Thanks :+1: . Hi @msherax,\nPlease provide an isolated jsfiddle demo for your setup. I'll try to help you :). Yes, sure :) You can send me an email at sachi77n@gmail.com. Oh, my bad. lightGallery is under GPLv3 license. I've updated the license file.\nThank you so much for hosting lightGallery on CDNJS \n. Hi @FutureMedia ,\nThe issue is because data-src is not available in your selector.  Please provide your HTML structure and Javascript so that I can guide you to fix the issue.. The above code should work properly. Plese provide a jsfiddle demo if the issue persists . Hope the issue is resolved :). Hi @anantheswarg881 ,\nYou need to destroy and re-initiate lightGallery. \nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\nLet me know if you need any further explanations \n. I think the gallery is not properly destroyed. It is difficult to debug without seeing the actual code. If you can send me an isolated(jsfiddle, plunker) demo, I'll fix the issue and send you back. . Please reopen if the issue persists . Hello,\nYou can add the following CSS into your document. \n``` css\n.lg-sub-html {\n    transition: transform 0.35s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 0.35s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s;\n}\n.lg-hide-items .lg-sub-html {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: translate3d(0px, 100%, 0);\n}\n```\nDemo: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LxGdoY.

Hi,\nPlease post all lightSlider related issues on this repo.\nYou've already set slideMargin: 0 in your settings. That is why the margin is not appearing.\njavascript\n$('#lightSlider').lightSlider({\n  gallery: true,\n  item: 1,\n  loop: true,\n  //slideMargin: 0,\n  slideMargin: 10,\n  thumbItem: 9\n});\n. Hi @erebel55,\nThumbnails plugin creates thumbnails only inside the lightBox gallery. It does not have any controller over your thumbnail markup(outside the gallery). However, if you want to load youtube thumbnails automatically, it is pretty easy. \nhtml\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video id>\" class=\"lightvideo\">\n    <img src=\"//img.youtube.com/vi/<video id>/default.jpg\">\n</a>\nhtml\n<div id=\"video-gallery\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBbDqAXago\" class=\"lightvideo\">\n    <img src=\"//img.youtube.com/vi/meBbDqAXago/default.jpg\">\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9yPrLWMyU\" class=\"lightvideo\">\n    <img src=\"//img.youtube.com/vi/Pq9yPrLWMyU/default.jpg\">\n  </a>\n</div>\nYou can refer the above code to generate thumbnails using video id \nHere is the updated jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/ont6hnux/10/\nLet me know if you have any queries \n. Hi @fofosfederation ,\nI've tried running your app. But it throws a lot of errors. Do you have an online demo available for your app? or can you reproduce the issue on a jsfiddle ?. I just commented the selecter property and everything works fine after that. \njavascript\nfunction createLG(){ //createLG() spawns a new lightGallery instance\n    $lg.lightGallery({ //activate lightgallery //lightgallery settings\n        pager: false,\n        speed: 325, //css animation speed in ms\n        preload: 2,\n        subHtmlSelectorRelative: true, //activate captions\n        fullScreen: true, //activate fullscreen plugin\n        autoplay: false, //dont automatically start autoplaying\n        progressBar: true, //disable autoplay progress bar\n        pause: 6500, //time between slide changes in ms\n        //selector: '.current' //selector class\n    });\n};. I think you should target the anchor tag inside #lightgallery instead of image with current class. Then only the captions will work as expected. If you use subHtmlSelectorRelative:true the subHtml div should be inside your selector. But in your case selector is an image tag.\nOtherwise, you need to remove the subHtmlSelectorRelative:true property and create unique id for each captions div and set the data-sub-html with the same id \nhtml\n<div id=\"lightgallery\" class=\"grid\">\n    <a href=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_1.jpg\" data-sub-html=\"#caption1\">\n        <img data-src=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_1.jpg\" class=\"gridItem assistantLightingDesigner electrician lazyloaded current\" onload=\"layoutIsotope()\" src=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_1.jpg\">\n        <div class=\"caption\" id=\"caption1\">\n            <h4><em>Caption1</em></h4>\n            <p>\"So give us shadows and give us gloom\"</p>\n        </div>\n    </a>\n    <a href=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_2.jpg\" data-sub-html=\"#caption2\">\n        <img data-src=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_2.jpg\" class=\"gridItem assistantLightingDesigner electrician lazyloaded current\" onload=\"layoutIsotope()\" src=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_2.jpg\">\n        <div class=\"caption\" id=\"caption2\">\n            <h4><em>Caption2</em></h4>\n            <p>\"So give us shadows and give us gloom\"</p>\n        </div>\n    </a>\n    <a href=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_3.jpg\" data-sub-html=\"#caption3\">\n        <img data-src=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_3.jpg\" class=\"gridItem assistantLightingDesigner electrician lazyloaded current\" onload=\"layoutIsotope()\" src=\"images/2016-the_addams_family_3.jpg\">\n        <div class=\"caption\" id=\"caption3\">\n            <h4><em>Caption3</em></h4>\n            <p>\"So give us shadows and give us gloom\"</p>\n        </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\njavascript\nfunction createLG(){ //createLG() spawns a new lightGallery instance\n    $lg.lightGallery({ //activate lightgallery //lightgallery settings\n        pager: false,\n        speed: 325, //css animation speed in ms\n        preload: 2,\n        //subHtmlSelectorRelative: true, //activate captions Remove this line \n        fullScreen: true, //activate fullscreen plugin\n        autoplay: false, //dont automatically start autoplaying\n        progressBar: true, //disable autoplay progress bar\n        pause: 6500, //time between slide changes in ms\n        selector: '.current' //selector class\n    });\n};\nIf this doesn't work for you, please provide an isolated static demo with isotop filter functionality. I'll fix the issue and send you back.\nYou can also refer to this issue https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/110. Hi @Elbatron ,\nindex property requires a number, But in your case you are passing a string. That is causing the issue.\nHere is the updated jsfiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/56rpLaby/5/. Hi @carol-braileanu ,\nMake sure that lightGallery.js is loaded before initializing the gallery. Also, please provide a working demo of the issue persists. I'll try to help you  . Hi @roybman ,\nGot the issue. It will be fixed in the next release.\nThank you for pointing this out.. Fixed... Could you please provide a jsfiddle demo or attach a screenshot of developer toolbar console?. Hi @aldwin7894,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. Screenshot did not help :). Could you please provide a jsfiddle demo.. Hey @aldwin7894 ,\nYour jsfiddle demo works fine for me. So probably this issue is with your code.  Please send me your source code if possible. I'll try to fix the issue.\nClosing as it is not the issue of lightGallery. Hi @tty123 ,\nThank you for pointing this out. I'll include the fix in next release . Fixed. @tty123 ,\nI'll include the fix in lightGallery.js as well . Hey @quach4 ,\nAt present lightGallery doesn't support this feature. I'll consider adding it if we get more requests for the same. . @SynCap ,\nIt was already there in my todo list :)\nI'll add an error message if selectors are not valid.. Hey @SynCap ,\nI've added an error message if data-src not available. Please use the latest version of lightGallery. Hi @twinsit,\nSorry for not being clear about the galleryId. It is only used to construct url when you use hash plugin - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/hash.html. You don't have to use dynamicId when you create dynamic gallery. \nPlease update your HTML and css code as shown bellow. and let me know the result.\nhtml\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <a id=\"openGallery\" class=\"button btnAllPhotos\" href=\"\">Alle foto's</a>\n  <a id=\"openFloor\" class=\"button btnAllPhotos\" href=\"\" style=\"margin-left: 100px\">Grondplannen</a>\n</div>\n``` javascript\n  var gallery = [{\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto0web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto0web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto1web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto1web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto2web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto2web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto3web-1.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto3web-1.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto3web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto3web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto4web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto4web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto5web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto5web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto6web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto6web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto7web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto7web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto8web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto8web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto9web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto9web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto10web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto10web.jpg\",\n}, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/display_foto12web.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/thumb_foto12web.jpg\",\n}];\n  $('#openGallery').on('click', function(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n      $(this).lightGallery({\n          dynamic: true,\n          dynamicEl: gallery\n      });\n  });\nvar part2 = [{\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/gelijkvloers.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/gelijkvloers.jpg\",\n  }, {\n      \"src\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/1everdieping.jpg\",\n      \"thumb\": \"https://www.estate-eleven.be/files/modules/estate/57/1everdieping.jpg\",\n  }];\n  $('#openFloor').on('click', function(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n      $(this).lightGallery({\n          dynamic: true,\n          dynamicEl: part2\n      });\n  });\n```.

Hi @maxsite ,\nThank you for pointing this out. I'll include this fix in the next release . Fixed. Hi @ALTELMA,\nI'll try to include the fix in the next release. when you click on the back button, if gallery id exists in the URL, the corresponding gallery will be opened.\nIf you don't want to use hash plugin you can simply remove it from your document or pass {hash: false} via settings . Hey @ALTELMA,\nThe issue has been fixed. From hash plugin v1.0.2 onwards, lightGallery does not create new history entries on URL hash change.. Hi @dharmenderpinjani ,\nPlease refer the following issue for the solution. https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/484. Thank you @scr34m ,\nI'll review your PR as soon as possible . I'm relly sorry for the delay :neutral_face:\nI'll definitely include your PR in next release . Hi @lyhongpon ,\nIt is not possible at the moment. if you call the destroy method, it will completely close the gallery. You can't append images when the gallery is opened. I'll let you know if I include this feature.. You need to destroy and re-initiate lightGallery after filtering by categories. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\nIf it is not clear, please provide an isolated jsfiddle demo with filtering option. I'll try to help you . Hi @yguedidi ,\njQuery lightGallery is more actively maintained than lightGallery.js. Because it has much more users than lightgallery.js\nIt doesn't mean that lightgallery.js is not maintained :). soon I'll make all the updates to lightgallery.js as well.\nLet me know if you have any other queries \n. Hi @gavphillips,\nI think your question is not so clear to me :) Could you please rephrase your question?. At present, if fourceAutoplay(sorry spelling is wrong, I'll update it :)) if enabled, autoplay will be stopped when you navigate to a different slide. But' won't when a link within data-sub-html is clicked. \nBut' if it an important requirement for you, maybe I can provide you a solution over the weekend. . Hi @dkebler ,\nYes, it is possible. Here is the complete list of lightGallery events. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#events\nI think you are looking for onBeforeOpen.lg and onBeforeClose.lg. Hi @rasstislav ,\nYour current configuration excludes the cloned elements. Do you want to include those elements in lightGallery?. It works fine for me. Please have a look at the demo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/examples.html(Integrate with lightGallery).\nIf the issue persists, Provide a jsfiddel demo. I'll fix the issue and send you back . Oh Sorry. I missed item:3 :disappointed:\nAt present we don't have a proper solution for this. Either we need to disable loop or need to set item:1. \nBut, I'll keep looking for a remedy and I'll post it if I get it figured out.\n. It seems to be working fine for me. Not tested properly, but, I don't see any breaking changes that effects lightGallery in jQuery 3.0.  Are you getting any issue when you use lightGallery with jQuery 3?. Works fine with jQuery 3.0.. Hi @62mkv ,\na) Yes, it is a bug. It'll be fixed in the next release. \nb) Not sure what is the issue. Could you please provide a jsfiddle demo or your website URL if it is available?. The issue has been fixed. Plese use the latest version of video plugin . Hi @neoman666,\nActually, this is lightGallery plugin developed by @jimblue. He has already shared his code, but i did not get time to implement that :disappointed:\nPlease send me an email at sachi77n@gmail.com. I'll send you the code.. I'm really sorry for the delay. I'll try to include it in version 1.4.. Hi @cakama3a ,\nPlease try adding the following CSS rules into your document(after lightGallery.css) and let me know the result \n``` css\n.lg-outer .lg-video {\n    padding-bottom: 0;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n.lg-outer .lg-video-cont {\n    height: 100%;\n}\n```. I think you are missing the hash plugin. https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-hash\nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/hash.html\nDocs: https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-hash\nPlease include lg-hash.js in your document and let me know the result. Could you please provide a jsfiddle which demonstrates your problem or your website URL if it is available?\nIt is very difficult to find the issue without seeing the code :pensive:.

Hey @recruitname ,\nYou need to include https://f.vimeocdn.com/js/froogaloop2.min.js in your document to pause Vimeo videos automatically \nDocs - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/videos.html. Hey @CCCullens ,\nThank you for pointing this out. I don't know how I missed it :)\nThe issue has ben fixed. Use the latest version of lg-autoplay plugin\n. Hey @recruitname ,\nI think the codepen demo you provided is not the actual one. Please update your demo according to your requirement or share your website URL. I'll try to help you. There are many ways to do this :)\nHere is the updated codepen - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qrLzvW\nYou can also try using the dynamic mode, instead of triggering the click manually - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/dynamic.html. Hey @Borming ,\nThe bellow code works fine for me.\n``` js\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nimport jQuery from 'jquery';\nwindow.$ = $;\nwindow.jQuery = jQuery;\nimport \"lightGallery\";\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery();\n```\nLet me know if you need a demo.. Hey @javic91 ,\nIt works fine for me. Could you please share a screenshot of your video gallery?. Hey @atulc,\nThanks for the video.\nAre you using any kind of touch screen monitor? Could you please try adding a debugger on lg-videos.js line no: 153 and check ?\njs\n_this.core.$el.on('onSlideClick.lg.tm', function() {\n  alert('calling')\n  var $el = _this.core.$slide.eq(_this.core.index);\n  loadOnClick($el);\n});. The issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version(1.6.0) of lightGallery and its modules.. Hey @CCCullens ,\nIt works fine for me. Could you please provide an isolated jsfiddle demo which demonstrates your problem. . Hey @topo9696 ,\nYou need to destroy and re-initiate lightGallery after clicking on categories. \nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\nIf it doesn't work please provide a working Jsfiddle demo. I'll fix the issue and send you back . You can use lightGallery selector property. Add a class to img2, img3 and img4 and use it as lightGallery selector.\nhtml\n<ul class=\"gallery\">\n  <li><img src=\"img1\"><li>\n  <li class=\"custom-selector\" data-src=\"img-lg-2\"><img src=\"img2\"><li>\n  <li class=\"custom-selector\" data-src=\"img-lg-3\"><img src=\"img3\"><li>\n  <li class=\"custom-selector\" data-src=\"img-lg-4\"><img src=\"img4\"><li>\n  <li><img src=\"img5\"><li>\n</ul>\njs\n$('#gallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: '.custom-selector'\n});\n. Hey @topo9696 ,\nSorry for the delayed response. You need to destroy and re-initiate lightGallery after clicking on the category.\nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\nAnd you have to use selector:'li:visible' to exclude hidden gallery elements (Other categories).\njs\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n     selector:'li:visible'\n});. Demo: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MpdRRX?editors=1010. Hey @lyhongpon ,\nAt present, this is not possible. lightGallery uses the same image for zooming. . Hey @CCCullens,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. The last fix works properly. Watch the demo carefully the first images(http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/1.jpg) is always getting loaded.  But sometimes it skips the second image as the network is too slow and the pause value is very less 500ms. \nNormally, the second image will be loaded before completing the first slide. Right now I'm closing the ticket as it is a very rare scenario and I don't want to make autoplay plugin complicated just because of this problem. Hope you understand. \nThank you so much for your effort and time. If we get more feature requests on the same I will definitely consider adding it.\n. Hey @PradViking ,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. You an easily disable the hash plugin by passing hash:false via settings,. Hey @JosephP91,\nTo display the sorted images in the gallery you just need to destroy and re-initiate lightGallery after sorting. Demo http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html. Hey @boyzoid ,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of share plugin.\n@arl1nd, Once again thank you for your contribution . Hey @arl1nd,\nThank you for your feedback :)\nYou can disable autoplay on first user action by setting fourceAutoplay: false.\nBut, you are right, autoplay time should reset when user navigates to next/prev slides. I'll try to include this in next release. \n. Hey @david43 ,\nThank you for pointing this out. It is a mistake in the docs. \nYou have to use enableSwipe instead of enableTouch. I'll update the docs soon\n. I've updated the docs... Hey @mrcomptech,\nYou have to use selector property when you use custom HTML structure. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html-markup.html\nIn your case, you might need to use \njs\n$('your-container').lightGallery({\n    selector: 'a'\n});\nIf it doesn't work, please provide a JsFiddle demo. I'll fix the issue and send you back :). Hey @djmtype ,\nSorry for not being clear about youtube thumbnails and posters.\nlightGallery does not load poster images from youtube because at the max youtube is providing 480*360 images. But still, if you want to load poster form youtube, you can simply pass the image url via data-poster attribute.\nhtml\n<div id=\"video-gallery\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBbDqAXago\" data-poster=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/meBbDqAXago/0.jpg\" >\n      <img src=\"img/thumb1.jpg\" />\n  </a>\n  ...\n</div>\nIn case of thumbnails, If loadYoutubeThumbnail is enabled, lightGallery automatically load thumbnails from YouTube. (Thumbnails you see on the bottom panael when lightGallery is opened) \nHope that is clear. Let me knoe if you have ny other queries . Hey @recruitname,\nI think this is the issue of cycle2 plugin. Everything works fine when I disable cycel2. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pPdJeO?editors=1010\nMaybe you can try using some other carousel instead.. Hey @jshapi05,\nYes, it is possible via CSS. The height of frame is controlled by padding-bottom property.\ncss\n.lg-outer .lg-video {\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%\n}\nYou can override it it 100% on mobiles \ncss\n.lg-outer .lg-video {\n    padding-bottom: 100%;\n}\nlet me know if you have any queries . Hey @duzun ,\nThank you for your suggestion. But, lightGallery support only one image at a time. So anyway adding drag mode won't help you to compare multiple photos.\nHope you understand.. Hey @recruitname,\nThanks for the kind words. I'm glad that you like lightgGallery. :)\nYou can pass all supported Vimeo parameters via setting vimeoPlayerParams.\nDemo: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/videos.html#video-player-param\nVimeo Parameters: https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/oembed#universal-parameters\nStill, if you want to use Iframe, that is also possible. You can use it in the same way how html5 videos works. \n``` js\n\n\n\n data-src should not be provided when you use html5 videos \n\n\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\nBut' it doesn't support features like posters or auto pause/play.\nLet me know if you need a demo.. Hey @recruitname,\nI'm sorry, It doesn't seem to be a good solution :disappointed:\nCould you please point out what options are not possible with parameters and possible with iframe approach\nhttps://developer.vimeo.com/apis/oembed#universal-parameters. Hey @justnorris,\nSince you are attaching all lightGallery instances to document, I'm assuming that you don't need lightGallery intestines anymore after closing the gallery. In that case, you case simply destroy the instance on onCloseAfter.lg event. \n``` js\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    let $document = $(this);\n$document.on('onCloseAfter.lg', function(event) {\n    $document.data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\n});\n\n$('#dynamic').on('click', function(e) {\n    $document.lightGallery({\n        dynamic: true,\n        dynamicEl: [{\n            src: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/1.jpg',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-1.jpg'\n        }, {\n            src: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBbDqAXago',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-v-y-1.jpg',\n            poster: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/videos/y-video1-cover.jpg'\n        }, {\n            html: '#video2',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/videos/y-video1-cover.jpg',\n            poster: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-v-y-1.jpg'\n        }, {\n            src: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/4.jpg',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-4.jpg'\n        }]\n    });\n});\n\n$('#dynamic2').on('click', function(e) {\n    $document.lightGallery({\n        dynamic: true,\n        index: 3,\n        dynamicEl: [{\n            src: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/1.jpg',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-1.jpg'\n        }, {\n            src: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBbDqAXago',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-v-y-1.jpg',\n            poster: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/videos/y-video1-cover.jpg'\n        }, {\n            html: '#video2',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/videos/y-video1-cover.jpg',\n            poster: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-v-y-1.jpg'\n        }, {\n            src: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/4.jpg',\n            thumb: 'http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/thumb-4.jpg'\n        }]\n    });\n});\n\n});\n```\nUpdated demo - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BRmrKO\nLet me know if you have any queries . Hey @piernik,\nI think it requires a lot of effort. \nThe easiest solution would be \n 1) Check the open state of lightGallery by checking $('your-selector').data('lightGallery').lGalleryOn \n 2) If lightGallery is on closed state, append the new images, destroy the gallery and re-initiate it - demo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\n 3) If lightGallery is on opened state, store the images in a variable, listen for lightGallery onCloseAfter.lg event, Then append the new images on onCloseAfter.lg , destroy the gallery and re-initiate it.\nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/events.html\nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#events\nI'll try to include a demo when i get time . Hey @leobr29,\nSorry for the delayed response. lightGallery doesn't support already instantiated videoJs. It automatically does that when you pass videojs: true via settings. If you want to show videos on both in the page and lightGallery I'd suggest you keep both videos separately. \nex:\nNormal Videos\nhtml\n<div>\n     <video id=\"my-player-40\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin video-player\" controls preload=\"auto\" poster=\"https://image.ifremer.fr/data/00384/49517/poster/35.jpg\">\n          <source src=\"https://image.ifremer.fr/data/00384/49517/ld/35.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n     </video>\n</div>\n<div>\n     <video id=\"my-player-41\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin video-player\" controls preload=\"auto\" poster=\"https://image.ifremer.fr/data/00384/49517/poster/36.jpg\">\n          <source src=\"https://image.ifremer.fr/data/00384/49517/ld/36.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n     </video>\n</div>\nVideos for lightGallery\nhtml\n<div id=\"video1\" style=\"display:none\">\n     <video id=\"my-player-40\" class=\"lg-video-object lg-html5\" controls preload=\"none\" >\n          <source src=\"https://image.ifremer.fr/data/00384/49517/ld/35.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n     </video>\n</div>\n<div id=\"video2\" style=\"display:none\">\n     <video id=\"my-player-41\" class=\"lg-video-object lg-html5\" controls preload=\"none\" >\n          <source src=\"https://image.ifremer.fr/data/00384/49517/ld/36.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n     </video>\n</div>\nI know the code is redundant. But, At present, I don't have any other solution.\nLet me know if you have any other queries . Hey @neoman666 ,\nYou can try adding the exif information via data-sub-html attribute and style it however you want. \nAnd you can write a simple plugin to show the popup on button click.\nPlugin API - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/plugin-api.html\nLet me know if you have any questions . Hey @machinegarethjohnsdesign ,\nThe above code is valid and it should work fine. http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/#markup\nLet me know if you have any further questions . Hey @karlsan ,\nThe issue has already been resolved in https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-autoplay/commit/ea8207031e303f7b4fc7bcb2b84623d708ad99b0\nPlease use the latest version of autoplay plugin. Hey @Stefanowitsch84,\nThe issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version of lg-video.js. Hey @gzmarques ,\nYes, it is possible. Set the image as a selector instead of the whole div. Here is the example of how to use selector property. If you still face any issues, please provide a jsfiddle demo with your HTML markup. I'll fix the issue and send you back . Hey @johnbunk028,\nHere is the demo of lightGallery share buttons - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/share.html\nYou just need to include the lg-share plugin on your document and provide necessary data-attributes.\nBut, If te issue is specific to the theme which you are using, I think you need to raise a support ticket to them :). Hey @LubosAngus ,\nThank you for pointing this out.  It works fine for me. As per the documentation, the third parameter of replaceState() accepts the relative URL as well. \nWhich browser and OS do you use?\nCould you please attach a screenshot of te issue.\n. Thanks @LubosAngus \nThe issue has been fixed in version 1.6.3. Hey @CodeBuilderPRO,\nThank you for pointing this out. I think this is an issue with the latest version of hash plugin. Please try using the version 1.0.1 and check. I'll try to fix the issue ASAP\n. You can download hash plugin from the following repository \nRepo - https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-hash\nVersion 1.0.1 - https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-hash/releases/tag/1.0.1\nDocs - https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-hash\nDemo - https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/hash.html. Hey @j0nr ,\nIt works fine for me. Images should be visible when the shared URL is opened. Could you please share the URL? So that I can have a look at the issue. . Hey @j0nr,\nUnfortunately, it is not possible without updating the core library code. If you are ok with that, you can comment lightGallery.js code from line number \n145 to 159 and then manually check for the gallery id in the URL hash and if it exists call lightGallery with the index found from the URL.\nMaybe you can write a small plugin to do this \nPlugin API - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/plugin-api.html\nHope that helps :)\nLet me know if you have any queries \nClosing as it not as issue of lightGallery. Once the dynamic gallery is created, you need to read the URL and if the gallery ID exists trigger click on the respective gallery. Still, if you face any issue, please share your code. I'll try to help you . You can simply trigger a click event on the particular element. For example, if the index of the item is 5\njs\nvar index = 5;\n$('yourGallery yourselector').eq(index).trigger('click');. Hey @TwoNiner,\nAre you using any touch screen laptop?. The issue has been fixed. Please use the latest version(1.6.0) of lightGallery and its modules.. Hey @AminulBD,\nhtml\n<a id=\"bipYOi\" href=\"\" data-poster=\"https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/videos/h-video1-poster.jpg\" data-sub-html=\"<h4>CGI Animated Short HD: Student Academy Award Winning 'PeckPocketed' by Kevin Herron</h4>\" data-html=\"#video1\">\n        Play\n</a>\nYou just need to remove the # from href attribute. href is considered as a fallback for data-src in lightGallery. When you use html5 videos data-src should not be provided. Since you are using anchor tag as a selector, you should not provide href property as well. \nSorry for not being clear about this. I'll update the documentation ASAP. Here is the updated codepen demo https://codepen.io/anon/pen/awmvjj. Hey @danb18,\nIf I understand your question correctly, you are looking for the dynamic demo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/dynamic.html\nThe following demo will help you to achieve the lazyload functionality \nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html. Hey @blairdow ,\nIt works fine for me. Could you please provide an isolated jsfidle demo for your setup?. Hey @skialper ,\nYes, you can use any grid plugin with lightGallery. Check out the Masonry library.\n It might help you :) . Hey @ramanjiram ,\nCould you please explain briefly how lightGallery is disturbing your dom elements? Or provide a jsfiddle wich demonstrates your issue?. Hey @ramanjiram,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. If I understand the problem correctly, removing the hash plugin from the document will solve the issue. \nIf the hash plugin is enabled and galleryId exists in the URL, lightGallery opens the respective slide automatically . Hey @pavlito ,\nYes, it is available. Here is the demo. Check the example - 'Integrate with lightGallery'\nLet me know if you have any queries . Hey @mixmasterfestus ,\nSorry for the delayed response. It works fine for me. Here is the demo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html5-videos.html#video-without-poster\nPlease try using the latest version of lg-video plugin\nIf the issue persists please provide a jsfiddle which demonstrates the issue . Hey @mixmasterfestus ,\nSorry for the delayed response. I missed your comment.  It is related to https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/pull/514\nWill be fixed in lightGallery v2.0. Closing as the issue is resolved.. Hey @danb18 ,\nYou have full control over the trigger button. You can simply disable the trigger button if the dynamicEl is empty .

Hey @intsfanatic,\nHere is the list of all supported Markups - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html-markup.html\nIn your case, If you could wrap the anchor tag with a div, I think the following markup will work fine\n``` html\n\nSome other image i want this to be in group1 \n\n<ul class=\"slider gallery\">\n   <li><a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">img inside slider</a></li><!-- i want this to be in group2 -->\n   <li><a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">img inside slider</a></li><!-- i want this to be in group2 -->\n</ul>\n\n\n js\n$('.gallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: '.lightgallery'\n});\n```\nSo that the galleries will be grouped properly. \nLet me know if you have any queries . No. You just need to add the class gallery to the groups and call it only once. \nEx \nhtml\n<div class=\"gallery\"\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group1 -->\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group1 -->\n<div> \n<div class=\"gallery\"\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group2 -->\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group2 -->\n<div>\n<div class=\"gallery\"\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group3 -->\n<div>\n<div class=\"gallery\"\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group4 -->\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group4 -->\n    <a class=\"lightgallery\" href=\"url-to-img\">Some other image</a><!-- i want this to be in group4 -->\n<div>\njs\n$('.gallery').lightGallery({\n    selector: '.lightgallery'\n});. At present, No. But I'll try to include this in lightGallery version 2.0. Hey @oguzhansari,\nI think you are missing the lg-video plugin. \nDocs - https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-video\nDemo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/videos.html\nIf it doesn't work, please provide a Jsfiddle which demonstrates the problem  .

Hey @noelebrun ,\n\nSo, there is the \"Load more\" Ajax solution\n\nYes, Here is the example - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\nRegarding the counter (Number of images. left-top)  - I'll try to add a setting for setting counter value in lightGallery version 2.0\n. Hey @gonardfreeman,\nSorry for the delayed response. Could you please provide a jsfiddle which demonstrates your problem?. Slide() method works only when lightGallery is open. Here is the demo - https://codepen.io/anon/pen/dRBMKx?editors=1010\nPlease re-open if the issue persists . Thanks :). Hey @brijendra98 ,\nNothing to do with README. The build is not failed but errored. I'll look into it.. Hey @alexmachadolove,\nI'm sorry, at present, this option is not available. Hey @beyond88,\nI'm really sorry for the delayed response. \nYou have to destroy the current lightGallery instance and re-initiate after appending new images.\nHere is the demo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html. Hey @Mons-web ,\nIt works fine for me. Could you please confirm that you haven't made any core configuration changes(ex pointer events) from the about:config section . Hey @smerriman,\nWorking on it.

I don't have any idea how Magento works. lightGallery works well with requireJs\nI'd suggest you report this to Magento team.\nFor your reference - \nhttp://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html (See the first error)\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/15371918/mismatched-anonymous-define-module. Hey @cfxd,\nThank you for the PR. But is it really required? If you just need text instead of the icon, I think you can do it by updating CSS.\ncss\n.lg-toolbar .lg-close:after {\n    content: 'close';\n}\nIf you are looking for something else, could you please provide an example?\n. Hey @nitinnix,\nMake sure that the font icons are on the correct path. You can also try loading CSS filed from cdnjs - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lightgallery/1.6.0/css/lightgallery.min.css\nPlease re-open if the issue persists . Hey @Alexandra667,\nEverything seems to be ok in your code.

Hey @bvsrao,\nPlease check the bellow link - https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/642. Hey @kenbond,\nThank you for pointing this out. It used to work with relative URL.

Hey @tobto,\nIt's related to https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/649\nYou need to provide absolute URL instead of relative URL in data-src attribute.\nFor example:\nhtml\n<li  data-src=\"../static/img/1.jpg\"></li>\nShould be \nhtml\n<li  data-src=\"http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/static/img/1.jpg\"> </li>. Hey @avconsbn,\nAt present, lightGallery supports only the above-mentioned share options. I'm working on lightGallery v 2.0 and I'll try to include more share options.. Hey @danb18,\nAt present, there is no default setting to disable auto-hide options. However, as a workaround, you can provide larger number via hideBarsDelay\nex:\njs\n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    hideBarsDelay: 6000000 // Controls will be hidden only after 6000000 milliseconds \n});\nHope that helps. I'll definitely add an option to disable auto-hide in next major release.. Hey @andreschmid98,\nCould you please provide a jsfiddle demo which demonstrates the issue?. Hey @Geo86,\nYes, it is possible. You just need to disable thumbnail from settings.\njs\n$('lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    thumbnail: false\n}).

You just need to disable thumbnail from settings. \n`` js\n$('lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    thumbnail: false\n}). Hey @Mickyfen17,\nThank you for pointing this out. It seems to be a bug :(\nI think we should update the index within theslide()method as well. I'll update it in the upcoming version. \nFor current use, you can set the index before you call theslide()` method.\nex: \n``` js\nvar $methods = $('#methods');\n$methods.lightGallery();\n$('#goto-slide').on('click', function() {\n  $methods.data('lightGallery').index = 2;\n  $methods.data('lightGallery').slide(2);\n});\nLet me know if you have any queries . You don't have to modify the source code.

It must be z-index issue. Could you please provide a jsfiddle demo or your website URL if available?. Hey @dapinododiadeal,\nIt seems to be a bug. I'll look into it and get back to you as soon as I get it figure it out.. After doing some research, I understood that Fullscreen needs to be triggered via some user events. It can't be triggered on load. \nMore info - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14244397/fullscreen-works-onclick-but-not-onload\nHowever, I'll keep looking for a remedy and get back to you if I get it figured out.\nmarking as can't fix .

Don't have much idea how it is getting appended.. Hey @elisafern12 ,\nAt present, there is no limit for zooming. But If you want to see the actual size of the image, double tap on the image or tap on the actual size button on the top toolbar.\nIn the demo, we use responsive images for mobile devices. So you might not get the full resolution on mobile devices.\nPlease re-open the issue if you are talking about any different problem. :P. Hey @bborrel,\nIt works fine for me. I followed the same steps you mentioned. But couldn't reproduce the issue. \nCould you please provide a demo which demonstrates the problem?.

Hey @semaf,\n\nTo control the height of the video, you can update the padding-bottom property of .lg-outer .lg-video. Padding is instead of height to maintain the proportionality \nWorks fine for me on chrome. Which version of chrome do you use?\nFixed in version 1.6.3\nNever experienced. It would be helpful if you could provide a demo . Hey @Robouste,\nIt is because bower is pointing into jquery version of lightGallery and you are using pure javascript version of lightGallery.\n\nTry bower install lightgallery.js instead of bower install lightgallery. Hey @WojciechMula,\nThis can be easily done by using lightGallery public methods.\njs\n  var $lg = $(\"#lightgallery\");\n  $lg.lightGallery(});\n  $(document).keypress(function(e) {\n    if (e.which === 32 || e.which == 13) {\n      $lg.data(\"lightGallery\").goToNextSlide();\n    }\n  });\nLet me know if you have any queries . 1) If you just wanted to prevent the download image option, you can simply prevent right click option on images .\nTry the following code. (Not tested)\njs\n$('body').on('contextmenu', '.lg-image', function(e){\n    e.preventDefault();\n});\n2) To make your code work for all the images, you need to listen for lightGallery onAfterSlide.lg event and apply the changes.\nDocs - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#events\n            http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/events.html. Hey @prashant93,\nlightGallery doesn't have any control on your thumbnails. You can design your thumbnails(outside lightGallery) however you want. It doesn't require any Javascript. you just need to provide the proper href attribut for each share links.\nIf you want the share option same as lightGallery just copy the generated markup from lightGaller and place it inside your thumbnails markup\nhtml\n<div id=\"lg-share\" class=\"lg-icon\"><ul class=\"lg-dropdown\" style=\"position: absolute;\"><li><a id=\"lg-share-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsachinchoolur.github.io%2FlightGallery%2F%23lg%3D1%26slide%3D0\"><span class=\"lg-icon\"></span><span class=\"lg-dropdown-text\">Facebook</span></a>\n</li>\n<li><a id=\"lg-share-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=share on twitter 1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsachinchoolur.github.io%2FlightGallery%2F%23lg%3D1%26slide%3D0\"><span class=\"lg-icon\"></span><span class=\"lg-dropdown-text\">Twitter</span></a></li>\n<li><a id=\"lg-share-googleplus\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsachinchoolur.github.io%2FlightGallery%2F%23lg%3D1%26slide%3D0\"><span class=\"lg-icon\"></span><span class=\"lg-dropdown-text\">GooglePlus</span></a></li>\n<li><a id=\"lg-share-pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsachinchoolur.github.io%2FlightGallery%2F%23lg%3D1%26slide%3D0&amp;media=static%2Fimg%2F1-1600.jpg&amp;description=Pin it1\"><span class=\"lg-icon\"></span><span class=\"lg-dropdown-text\">Pinterest</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\nNote: You need to provide the proper content and shareUrl for each thubnails. At present, No. But this is not hard to implement. I'll try to add a container option in v 2.0. Hey @alexjose,\nThis is just a demo to show how to implement facebook comments with lightGallery. You can easily update the css to make the demo responsive.\nSend me an email a2 sachi77n@gmail.com if you want the responsive version of the demo . Yes, It is possible. You just need to pass autoplay: true via settings\nHere is the demo - https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yzmKXX. Docs for autoplay - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#lg-autoplay.

Hey @AcclaimWorks,\nit works fine for me. Is it happening in the demo as well? - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/html5-videos.html. Hey @chrisdeeming,\nSorry for the confusion. The behavior specified in the demo page has been changed. There were few issues with the old approach. At present, hash plugin doesn't create new history, It replaces the history and changes the URL. Basically, it just allows you to open gallery from a url.\nI'll update the docs. If you want the old behavior, you can use version 1.0.1 -  https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-hash/releases/tag/1.0.1\nAlso, please have a look at this link https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/547 to know more about the issue . You can either create thumbnail images with play icon or add using css after, before pseudo selectors.\nPlease let me know if you need any help with this . Hey @pb1uk ,\nYouTube nocookie already works with latest version lightGallery. - Here is the demo - https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pVMgdV. Hey @SergioPaoloFassina,\nThe current version doesn't support pinch to zoom. It is already done in 2.0 which will be released in next couple of weeks . Hey @Jesperanza,\nThank you for the purchase. You can always download the latest version from github or install using bower or npm. It works fine for me. If you are using multiple galleries, you need to use the respective instance to destroy the gallery. \nIf the issue persists please share your code. Sure, I'd be happy to try it out :P. Javascript version of lightGallery doesn't accept jQuery element.\nYou need to pass native DOM element in the lightGallery function.\nInstead of \njs\nlightGallery(element.parent());\nuse \njs\nlightGallery(element.parent()[0]);\njs\n.directive('lightgallery', function() {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n      if (scope.$last) {\n        lightGallery(element.parent()[0]);\n      }\n    }\n  };\n});\nHere is the working copy - http://plnkr.co/edit/YhDCqGFR2d0lTzQqiSSM?p=preview. Hey @5VRod,\nBy default, lightGallery expects data-src/href on the child items. But in your case, you have href on the container itself. \nSo you need to pass selector:'this' via settings.\nThe below code should work\njs\n$('.btn-yt-link.btn-play').each(function() {\n  $(this).lightGallery({\n    zoom: false,\n    thumbnail: false,\n    autoplayControls: false,\n    share: false,\n    download: false,\n    selector: 'this'\n  });           \n});. Docs - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#methods\nDemo - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html. Hey @Anlaur,\nSorry for the delayed response. Seems like you have not included lightGallery.js in your document. I see only lightSlider code. If you don't need lightGallery, you can just remove the following code block from your document \njs\nonSliderLoad: function(el) {\n            el.lightGallery({\n                selector: '.image-gallery'\n            });\n        }\nIt should work fine . You can set startClass:'' to remove the starting animation \nDocs - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html\njs\n$(\"#gallery\").lightGallery({\n  download: false,\n  currentPagerPosition: 'middle',\n  speed:0,\n  toogleThumb: false,\n  hideBarsDelay: 3600000,\n  backdropDuration: 0,\n  thumbMargin: 11,\n  slideEndAnimatoin: false,\n  startClass:''\n});. Try the following code\n``` js \nvar $workGrid = $(\"#work-grid\");\n$workGrid.lightGallery({\n    mode: 'lg-fade',\n    cssEasing: 'cubic-bezier(0.25, 0, 0.25, 1)',\n    download: false,\n     share: false,\n     selector: 'ecp-thumbnail'\n});\n$workGrid.on('onBeforeOpen.lg', function (event) {\n    alert($workGrid.data('lightGallery').$items.eq(0).data('src'));\n});\n```\nYou can access all lightGallery public variables via data('lightGallery'). Hey @valjar,\nYou can add your javascript functions on the onAfterAppendSubHtml.lg event listener.\nNot sure about VueJs. But jQuery should work fine.\nDocs - http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/docs/api.html#events\nDemo- http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/events.html\n. Hey @fsoabsix,\nI didn't understand your question properly. Could you please re-phase it?. Hey @amcolash ,\nThanks for the plugin. I can add it to the documentation. It would be great if you could publish the plugin as NPM package as well. You can simply use figure as selector. \nThe below code should work fine \njs\n$('#portfolio_grid').lightGallery({\n    hash: false,\n    selector: 'figure'\n});. Here is the similar demo -http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/methods.html\nLet me know if you have any questions . Yes, you can do this by adding the below CSS rule. \ncss\n    .lg-backdrop {\n        bacnground-image: url('your-custom-background.jpg');\n    }. Guys, Really sorry for the delayed response. The issue has been fixed. . Hey @zzseba78 \nVanilla JavaScript version of lightGallery is already available - https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery.js . dynamicEl should be defined when you use dynamic mode. And i think in any situation index won't go beyond the length of the array. Did you face any issue because of the old code?. If yes please explain the scenario..\n. Hi Guys,\nCan we simplify the code?\njavascript\nsubHtml = this.$items.eq(index).attr('data-sub-html') || this.$items.eq(index).attr('title') || this.$items.eq(index).find('img').attr('alt')\nAnd how do we manage if there are multiple images under a selector?\n.

    "tammo0": "Hi Joshua,\ni know its a dirty way but here is a workaround, fixing it with jQuerys .wrap() function:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/r2GT7/\ngreetings\n. I \"fixed\" my problem in a kind of dirty way:\nBefore i change my filtered gallery content i remove following eventListeners from every item inside the gallery container:\n$(\".contentitem\").unbind(\"click\");\n$(\".contentitem\").unbind(\"touch\");\n$(\".contentitem\").unbind(\"touchstart\");\nafter that i remove out filtered items and insert the selected items into the container and simply initialize lightGallery again to the container:\n$(\"#gallerycontainer\").lightGallery({loop:true, exThumbImage:'data-extthumbimage'})\nwhen i use the .lightGallery(\"destroy\") method first instead of simple initialize it again and again it stops working.\n. Hi Sachin,\nthank you for your answer.\nI know what lightGallery is and i enjoy using it. But i am missing a method to remove it.\nLike every other jQuery Plugin or Widget it needs a function which deletes all changes and events done on its initialize.\nFor example when i add a jQuery-UI \"Accordion Widget\" it can be done with $( \".selector\" ).accordion() like lightGallery can be setup by doing $( \".selector\" ).lightGallery()\nFor cleaning the cache, removing the eventListener and getting back my origin DOM $( \".selector\" ).accordion( \"destroy\" ) offers a function to do it because the widget knows what it has manipulated. Exact that is what i am missing at lightGallery, because it is not \"just\" a fullscreen gallery - it manipulates the origin DOM too to do its good job.\nDo you know what i mean?\nKindly regards,\ntammo\n. Hi @sachinchoolur ,\nmy page is not public yet, so i provide a jsfiddle for you:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5N6VV/1/\nI use this filter method to prevent loading images again and to be able to add some animations.\nTo explain: every image can be in multiple categories. in this case called \"filtertype1\", \"filtertype2\", \"filtertype3\".\nThe scenario: We start at a page where filtertype1 is active. When i change the filter to filtertype2 you can see that the first image still opens lightGallery because it is attatched to filtertype1 aswell. But image2 does nothing because of the missing eventListener (it was not in the lightGallery container when it gets initialized).\nTry#1: $(\"#container\").lightGallery(\"destroy\") do my filterings and $(\"#container\").lightGallery() again. - doesnt work. :(\nTry#2: When i initialize lightGallery after my content has changed, it opens on click at images which are \"new\" and turns black when i click at images which already were there at the first initialisation. damn :( .\nWorkaround: before my filter does anything i remove all click and touch eventlistener from every image in the lightGallery container, i do my filtering and initialize lightGallery again. But its not the most clever way because i dont know what lightGallery does beside listening to click and touch events to the childs of its container.\nconclusion: i think it would be an improvement to add a public function to destroy/remove the full functionality of lightGallery.\nregards, tammo\n.

Also for fixing bugs or writing features its better to have different issues you can relate to.\n. @sachinchoolur, please try again to merge.\ni send a mail to github support and they fixed my repro. no idea whats was wrong with it.\nthanks\n. for the navigation:\ni think its because the event \"touchmove\" fires instead of \"touchend\" which is we are listening to.\nmy mobile is out of power but i will try to fix it when its up again. Or you try it by your own.\nAt line 421 the eventListener for the arrownavigation are set.\n. hi @erbertian,\nbecause i dont have any iOS devices please check if this repro is working for you:\nhttps://rawgithub.com/tammo0/lightGallery/test/light-gallery/js/lightGallery.js\ni dont want to start a pull request until you tested it.\n. Hi @sachinchoolur,\nthe problem was that lightGallery was just listening to touchend but iOS seem to fire touchcancel.\ncompare line 419 and 423 of your code with line 430 and 434 of my test-fork:\n/tammo0/lightGallery/blob/master/light-gallery/js/lightGallery.js\n. How is your implementation of lightGallery?\nDo you have the following meta tag in your html or is it missing:\nmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no\"\n. no, the icons are chars of a font, set with the css content attribute.\nWhen you change the background of \"#lightGallery-outer\" to lets say #FF0000 - can you see the nav-elements as empty black blocks or are they entirely invisible?\nyou can change the css settings of \"#lightGallery-action\" to:\nlightGallery-action {\nbottom: 20px;\nposition: absolute;\nz-index: 2000;\nwidth: 100%;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n. hi @KlausKerava,\nplease post your user agent string. You can get it here:\nhttp://www.mybrowserinfo.com/\n. Hi @KlausKerava,\nthanks for the string. It doesnt seem to be really a lightGallery problem but Android at GalaxyTab.\nBecause i can not test it, please take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/J4vUm/1/embedded/result/ and tell me if the navbar at the bottom is visible.\n(you may need to scroll down because of the jsfiddle frame)\ngreetings,\ntammo\n. Hi @KlausKerava,\ncool they are there now. Next step is to check out if they are working or not, or just not working because they are behind the DockBar.\nCheckout http://jsfiddle.net/J4vUm/3/embedded/result/ where i pushed them more into center and try to touch them. \nregards,\ntammo\n. Hi Klaus,\nok, nice to hear. Because its a very specific problem for a single device (with the DockBar) i am not sure if we shall integrate a new design. I think its up to @sachinchoolur to decide it and as long as you can swipe through the gallery images the navbar isnt really needed, but the close button.\nBut I will checkin the functionality fix because it doesnt affect other things as far as i know.\nYou can change the position, width, height and other appearances with your own CSS definitions and overwrite the origins of lightGallery if you like. Just make sure you integrate them after you include the lightGallery CSS file.\nThank you for reporting the bug anyways. :+1: \ntammo\nPS: see #17. You can use my fork while Sachin hasnt merged the pull request\n. btw @sachinchoolur, i dont update the min version. you need to do it by your own\n. hi @sachinchoolur \nno, for this issue it was just a css change for nav elements:\n-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\nand position:relative; for #lightGallery-Gallery\n. Hi @Maneface,\nthe jsfiddle works fine for me in chrome and firefox.\nWhich Browser do you use? Firefox? Google for the Errormessage.\nCan you play the videos in jsfiddle but not in your own test environment? Perhaps the .htaccess is missing then (look at the bottom of http://www.html-seminar.de/html-5-video.htm ).\n. There are 2 ways: Provide a *.webm file for Firefox user (which will be the best solution and has to be included to lightGallery) or tell your browser how to handle such mediafiles (e.g. by configure the quicktime plugin).\n. Hi!\nWhat do you mean by \"doesn't work\"? Still the same error?\nDid you add a plugin to firefox and provided an htaccess for the mimetypes like i said?\ngreetings\n. ",

I'm not sure why this won't work with infinitescroll with the destroy method. Here is a jsfiddle example showing the issue I am having. Everything works fine on the initial load but when one adds new images, the new images will open normally in lightgallery but the initially loaded images (if you scroll down and open one) do not show correctly but have a dark background over the popup. \nAlso, if I use this code, it works:\nvar gallery = $(\"#gallery\").lightGallery();\n   setTimeout(function() {\n   $(\".light\").unbind(\"click\");\n        $(\".light\").unbind(\"touchstart\");\n        $(\".light\").unbind(\"touch\");\n  gallery.destroy(); // destroy gallery\n        gallery = $(\"#gallery\").lightGallery({ selector: '.light'}); //re-initiate gallery\n    }, 100);\n.

Hi Tammo0,\nThanks for advises, but these didn't solve the problem.\nI changed the bacground to #ff0000, i saw the close-nav black box about 0.1 seconds and then it disappeared. I didnt see the bottom nav-elements at all.\nThe changes to #lightGallery-action didnt sove the problem either.\nI have tested now Iphone 4/4S, iPad2, Desktop FF, Chrome, IE11, IE10 - Gallery is working just fine with these, only the GalaxyTab and its default browser loses the nav-elements.\n. Hi,\nThe user agent string is:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 3.2; fi-fi; GT-P7300 Build/HTJ85B) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/534.12\n. Hi tammo0,\nThe bottom navbar and the close button on the right hand corner are visible on  http://jsfiddle.net/J4vUm/1/embedded/result/  -page with GalaxyTab/Android. Close button is also working fine, but the bottom nav bar is partially under the GalaxyTab Dock-bar and it's not possible to push the bottom nav-buttons. Same problem on landscape and portrait orientations. \n. Hi Tammo0,\nYes, now the bottom nav bar is in good location, the arrows are working, but the all images thumbs appears under the current open big image, so there might be some z-index problems.\nAlso, the arrows are quite small and close to each other, ..could they be ie. 25% larger and bit more space beetween the nav elements. Anyway, this is already really cool.\nRegards,\nKK\n. ",

(with a couple of tweaks)\n. ",
    "HybridSolutions": "Hi,your plugin seems great but I'm seeing critical old issues like this one, still not addressed. Are you still developing this plugin?\nThank you!\n. Any development on this issue? Thanks :)\n. @q2apro The second code you provided is not working :( Checked console and no errors. Do I need any additional script since you are using enablejsapi:1?\nThanks!\n. Looks awesome @sachinchoolur ! Looking forward for the final release!\n. @jawadsahil , I'm having the same problem and solved it by instantiating the plugin in the following manner:\n$('.lightGallery').each(function(){            \n        $(this).lightGallery({\n            selector: $(this).find('.hotlink'),\n            exThumbImage: 'data-exthumbimage'\n        });      \n    });\nmy .lightgallery is yours .gallery and my .hotlink is yours .item.\nI agree that for multiple galleries the selector is not working as it should since it's looking in the entire DOM instead of just inside the element we attached the plugin to.\n. Do we still need to use the .each workaround for multiple galleries on a page? Thanks!\n. Hi,\nsorry for not being clear enough. If you take a look at fancybox usage, you'll see that you can with one call to the script, instantiate infinite galleries. The trick is on the rel keyword that specifies to which gallery the image will be attached to. Also, you can have the gallery item as an a tag but that I've seen that I can do with the selector option :). How would you instantiate multiple galleries on a page with this plugin? Also, when used with Isotope filtering, how can I update the gallery with that filtering info?\nThank you!\n. Multiple galleries is not working when using custom selector. Also, tried to use the destroy method, but when i try to open the filtered image, i get the black overlay with nothing else. I tried to use without custom selector as well with the same result. \nHere's the code i'm using:\n<ul class=\"lightGallery2 row isotope-grid\">\n      <li data-src=\"demo_photos/photo1.jpg\" class=\"isotope-item 2012 col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n        <img src=\"demo_photos/photo1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"\">\n      </li>\n      <li data-src=\"demo_photos/photo2.jpg\" class=\"isotope-item 2013 col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n        <img src=\"demo_photos/photo2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n      </li>\n    </ul>\nIn the filtering function, i'm calling this:\n```\n$container.isotope({ filter: filterValue });       \n            $container.isotope('updateSortData').isotope();\n        gallery.destroy();\n        gallery = $(\".lightGallery2\").lightGallery({        \n            //selector:'.hotlink'\n        });\n\n```\ni tested that the gallery variable was not null and that it returned the gallery object.\nCan you please test this out, because i really like your plugin but I need it to work with Isotope :(\nThank you, once again!\n. Hi, you can download a working example from here. This example has two galleries, both with isotope applied. As you will see, LightGallery is not opening the images and is also ignoring the filtered items even after a destroy.\nhttp://gofile.me/2B2vF/Huz1qzfK\n(the link will be available for 1 week)\n. Hi!\ndid, you manage to check my demo?\n. Sure,\nhere it is: http://gofile.me/2B2vF/LzG55jRs\nJust let me know when you download the file.\n. Hello,\nThat worked great! The issue I mentioned about multiple galleries using a class as a selector is the one mentioned here https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/103\nThis doesn't happen when you use unique id's instead of common css classes for the gallery container. For now, what do you suggest to be able to still use a common css class for all the galleries?\nThank you :)\n. ok, but why don't you use the data-src instead? Having to repeat the same path on the same element doesn't make much sence. Don't you get the thumbnail from the data-src when a custom selector isn't being used?\n. ",
    "kowalski90": "This feature would indeed be very useful. Those less savvy internet users just assume that by clicking on another video, the previous one playing will stop playing, just like it's happening on YouTube. \nAnother option would be to start the video automatically once clicked from the thumbnail, or when clicking next/previous arrows.\nPlease consider this. Thank you!\n. ",
    "q2apro": "Jumping into the train as well. LightGallery is great, but this missing feature is \"confusing\" to users. Everybody assumes that the other video stops automatically when navigating to the new one. \n. If you are not using videoAutoplay:true then you can use this workaround to stop the videos: \n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('#videolist').lightGallery({\n        videoAutoplay: false,\n        onSlideNext: function() { \n            $('iframe[src*=\"youtube.com\"]').each(function() {\n                var src = $(this).attr('src');\n                $(this).attr('src', '');\n                $(this).attr('src', src);\n            });\n        }\n    });\n});\nIf videoAutoplay:true then the first video will start immediately again after the src has been assigned again.\n. Okay, here is a clean implementation that pauses all youtube videos if previous or next is clicked. It works with videoAutplay:true as well: \n```\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('#videolist').lightGallery({\n        videoAutoplay: true,\n        youtubePlayerParams: {\n            enablejsapi:1,\n        },\n        onSlideNext: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n        },\n        onSlidePrev: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n        },\n        onSlideBefore: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n        },\n        onSlideAfter: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n        },\n    });\nfunction pauseAllYoutube() { \n    $('iframe[src*=\"youtube.com\"]').each(function() {\n        var iframe = $(this)[0].contentWindow;\n        iframe.postMessage('{\"event\":\"command\",\"func\":\"pauseVideo\",\"args\":\"\"}', '*');\n    }); \n}\n\n});\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Just open a jsfiddle, you will see it works. Maybe you have another version of the script? Or some other code of yours is interfering.\n. Sounds like a memory issue with the ipad.\n. I ran into the same issue. I think lightGallery should at least state in the dev console something like \"Youtube videos will only work on your server.\" - Then it's clear to every developer. Thx.\n. Oh, just now I see that it actually works and that the HTML for the other fields was wrong...\nIssue can be closed.\n. Ah, after the question I found it in the docs here: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/settings.html\nselector   class name / id name    null    Custom selector property instead of just child.\nHowever, specifying: \n$('#videoliste').lightGallery({\n    selector: '.popup2',\n});\nopens only an empty black lightGallery screen. The video is obviously not \"taken\"...\n. Okay, got it. I need to add all attributes to the .popup2 element/s.\nExample: \n<a class=\"popup2\" href=\"#\" data-src=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OSjWC93gVI\" data-exthumbimage=\"http://www.echteinfach.tv/videos/thumbs/X01.png\" data-sub-html=\"#X01\">\nNow it works!\n. The issue could be solved with the answer to the question: How to set the video size (width and height) with lightGallery?\n. Seems that I cannot even set the iframe size using: \n$(\"iframe\").attr(\"width\", \"200\");\nor\n$(\"iframe\").width(200);\nNo effect on the screen.\n. All right, I could solve this by changing the CSS only, width from 100% to 70% and left from 0% to 15% so that the video is still centered:\n```\nlg-slider .video .object {\nwidth: 70% !important;\nheight: 100% !important;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0px;\nleft: 15%;\n\n}\n```\nHowever, I also have few videos that are 16:9. Now the question is how I can assign different video size classes to them?!\n. I am one step closer to the solution:\nIn HTML I add the class \"widescreen\" to the selector element that triggers the video box of lightGallery. \nThen I use:\nCSS:\n```\nlg-slider .video .object {\nwidth: 70% !important;\nheight: 100% !important;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0px;\nleft: 15%;\n\n}\n.widescreenclass {\n    width: 100% !important;\n    height: 100% !important;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0px;\n    left: 0;\n}\n```\nJS:\n```\n    onOpen: function(el) { \n        checkForWidescreen(el);\n    },\nfunction checkForWidescreen(el) { \n    // console.log(el);\n    // console.log(el[0].innerHTML);\n    if( *** check for class .widescreen ***) {\n        $('#lg-slider .video .object').addClass('widescreenclass');\n        $('#lg-slider .video .object').removeClass('object');\n    }\n}\n\n```\n*** How can I find out if the element that is bound to the video has class \".widescreen\"? Can I see this in the el object?\nOR asked differently: Can I pass a data parameter to the el object? From within the other data attributes?\nEdit:\nconsole.log(el['context']['activeElement']); // gives me the HTML of the clicked element but only for onOpen, if navigating it stays the same\nSince I am stuck here, I opened another issue for passing an attribute from the HTML to the gallery object: https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/135\n. This is my latest solution - it seems not to be \"proper\" but kind of works in Firefox and Chrome: \n1. HTML\nWe need the class \"widescreen\" in the selector and \"iswidescreen\" in custom-html: \n<li>\n    <span class=\"lesson\">Tutorial</span>\n    <a class=\"popup2 widescreen\" href=\"#\" data-src=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OSjWC93gVI\" data-exthumbimage=\"thumbs/X01.png\" data-sub-html=\"#X01\">\n        <img src=\"thumbs/X01.png\">\n    </a>\n    <div class=\"descr\">\n        Dies ist ein kurzes Tutorial ...\n        <div class=\"custom-html\">                   \n            <span class=\"iswidescreen\"></span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</li>\n2. CSS\n```\n/ defaults all videos to 4:3 video format /\nlg-slider .video .object {\nwidth: 70% !important;\nheight: 100% !important;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0px;\nleft: 15%;\n\n}\n/ for 16:9 video format /\n.widescreenclass {\n    width: 100% !important;\n    height: 100% !important;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0px;\n    left: 0;\n}\n```\n3. JS\n```\n    $('#videoliste').lightGallery({\n        preload:0, // saves bandwidth for videoload\n        thumbnail: false,\n        exThumbImage: 'data-exthumbimage',\n        selector: '.popup2',\n        videoAutoplay: true,\n        lang: { allPhotos: 'Alle freien Videos' }, \n        youtubePlayerParams: {\n            enablejsapi:1,\n            showinfo:1,\n            wmode: 'opaque',\n            modestbranding:1,\n            iv_load_policy:1,\n            rel:0,\n            vq:'large',\n        },\n        onSlideNext: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n            checkForWidescreen(el);\n        },\n        onSlidePrev: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n            checkForWidescreen(el);\n        },\n        onSlideBefore: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n            checkForWidescreen(el);\n        },\n        onSlideAfter: function(el) { \n            pauseAllYoutube();\n            checkForWidescreen(el);\n        },\n        onOpen: function(el) { \n            checkForWidescreen_onopen(el);\n        },\n    });\nfunction pauseAllYoutube() { \n    $('iframe[src*=\"youtube.com\"]').each(function() {\n        var iframe = $(this)[0].contentWindow;\n        iframe.postMessage('{\"event\":\"command\",\"func\":\"pauseVideo\",\"args\":\"\"}', '*');\n    }); \n}\n\nfunction checkForWidescreen_onopen(el) { \n    var html = (el['context']['activeElement'].outerHTML);\n    if (html.indexOf('widescreen') > -1) {\n        // wait 1s so that video content gets loaded, then change video size\n        setTimeout(function() { \n            $('#lg-slider .video .object').addClass('widescreenclass');\n            $('#lg-slider .video .object').removeClass('object');\n        }, 1000);\n    }\n}\nfunction checkForWidescreen(el) { \n    // get customhtml of current element\n    var customhtml = $('.lg-slide.current').find('.custom-html').html();\n    if (customhtml.indexOf('iswidescreen') > -1) {\n        // wait 1s so that video content gets loaded, then change video size\n        setTimeout(function() { \n            $('#lg-slider .video .object').addClass('widescreenclass');\n            $('#lg-slider .video .object').removeClass('object');\n        }, 1000);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nEven though we set a timeout it is not guaranteed that the video object exists and can be accessed. \nI really vote for a change in the lightgallery core: \nlightGallery.js\nvideo = '<iframe class=\"object\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/' + youtube[1] + a + '\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>';\nProbably the video size should not be hardcoded. Or at least, we should be able to at least set a ratio.\nI would be glad to hear about other solutions.\n. Got it working!

With 40 images and preload set to 1, when the slider loads, only the 2nd image will be fetched. When clicking next image (or swiping)  a few times  the images that are already shown stay in the DOM and thus take up memory. Would be better if preload also would remove/add images in the dom based on a virtual image list (js array with images or something)\n. What version are u using? If its an older version of lightgallery, please try the following setting:\nuseCSS: false,\nThe underlying cause of the crash is the css translation function. On iOS, using this function on too many elements or with a value that is too high, it causes memory issues. Some usefull links:\nhttp://cubiq.org/testing-memory-usage-on-mobile-safari\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11298821/mobile-safari-translate3d-pixel-limit\nhttp://www.tricedesigns.com/2013/03/11/performance-ux-considerations-for-successful-phonegap-apps/\n.

You are so correct.

It would help me get rid of one plugin (imagesloaded.js) and get rid of a lot of lines of hacky-code to achieve the result :P\nDhanyavadagalu Sachin.\n. Works like a charm.\nI have been trying to edit the CSS to make it 'fade' in when it successfully loads but I seem unable to get it right. I don't suppose you would know what I would need to do in the lightgallery.css to make that happen?\nI used jQuery to fade in/out the gallery on load/exit as I couldn't figure out how to do that via CSS either.\n. I appreciate the response.\n.lightGallery-slide img, .lightGallery-slide iframe {\n    transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n    -moz-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n    -ms-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n    -webkit-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n    -o-transform: scale3d(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);\n    -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 0.5s ease 0s;\n    -moz-transition: -moz-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 0.5s ease 0s;\n    -o-transition: -o-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 0.5s ease 0s;\n    -ms-transition: -ms-transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 0.5s ease 0s;\n    transition: transform 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1) 0s, opacity 0.5s ease 0s;\n}\nAll editing I do to that CSS class however doesn't do anything except for the first image that loads. I believe it is more that when the 'complete' class is applied that is when it fails to fade. Am I missing something here? It is just a bit sudden for the image load to go 'bam' when all the image slides are nice fades.\n. Changing preload to 0 just makes every image I navigate to show the loading indicator, but editing the class on line 160 still does nothing to effect anything other than the first image shown.\nAh, I seem to have narrowed down the problem. My test browser is a clean install chrome 37 and firefox 32 (no extensions or anything, just a blank install), but internet explorer 11 actually performs the expected behavior. Any ideas? \n. I'd love to but my setup is rather complicated and I would not really know how to boil it down to the bare essentials. Apologies. I've tried stripping out everything that wasn't your original code to try and whittle it down but it still behaves oddly.\nIf it is something that looks like it is just on my end then I'll leave it at that. If I ever find out why I'll post my fix here.\n. Ah, I can duplicate my problem!\nhttp://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/examples.html\nIf you click on your \"Load Dynamically\" example it has the same error that mine does (I create mine dynamically also).\n. Would appear that I somewhat jumped the gun there (overworking myself methinks).\nThe function actually does work fine on everything, it was something on my browser that was interfering. Le sigh.

Hey @sachinchoolur the selector option does not allow me to set a link (a) to use its href attribute :\\\nOne of my questions was 'why do you force us to use the data-src attribute' and taking a look to the code I see there's no other way, as you don't check for an href attribute:\nhttps://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/blob/master/light-gallery/js/lightGallery.js#L359\n``` js\nvar $this = this;\nvar i, j, l = $children.length - index;\nvar src;\nif (settings.preload > $children.length) {\n    settings.preload = $children.length;\n}\nif (settings.mobileSrc === true && windowWidth <= settings.mobileSrcMaxWidth) {\n    if (settings.dynamic) {\n        src = settings.dynamicEl[index].mobileSrc;\n    } else {\n        src = $children.eq(index).attr('data-responsive-src');\n    }\n}\n// Fall back to use non-responsive source if no responsive source was found\nif (!src) {\n    if (settings.dynamic) {\n        src = settings.dynamicEl[index].src;\n    } else {\n        src = $children.eq(index).attr('data-src');\n    }\n}\n```\nSo, I ask again... Why do you force us to use the data-src attribute? It does not follow any standard... \nInstead of using custom data params, why not to use the default and usual params, like the href attribute from an a or the new HTML5 srcset attribute (?):\nhttp://demosthenes.info/blog/944/Responsive-Images-For-Retina-Using-HTML5s-srcset\n. Yes, using data-src is semantic too but I was referring to the SEO impact, as you said.\nBy default I would check for an href attribute and, in case we can't find it, then I would fallback to use the data-src attribute.\nI also said that the srcset could also be used as an alternate data-responsive-src (if no srcset was found, then fallback to data-responsive-src) but there's no need to do nothing with the srcset as, if it has been defined, the browser will be the one who'll change the src of the image based on the pixel density or the screen width.\n. @sachinchoolur could you please open again this issue or the issue #107 so we can continue talking about this? If it's closed usually means that has been resolved, which is not the case.\nI've finally solved this issue by manually adding the data-src before executing the lightGallery plugin:\n``` js\n$(\"article section.body figure\").each(function() {\n    var image = $(this).find('img'),\n        link = $(this).find('a');\nimage.attr('data-src', link.attr('href'));\n\nlink.lightGallery();\n\n});\n```\nAnyway, I think that the default behavior should be search for a standard SEO-friendly tag/attribute (which is the common used way...) as it's a.\n. :+1: :smile: \n. :+1:\n. You're welcome.\nWould you also take a look to sachinchoolur/lightslider#104 and sachinchoolur/lightslider#106 please? Thanks :smile: \n. Well... it's a basic feature of any slideshow/gallery... \n. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna use disquss for a bug report... \n.

Hi,\nI came across this issue too. I dealt with it by using the following CSS/JS which only works if correctly having: toogleThumb: true on init.\nCSS\n.lg-sub-html{\n   bottom: 100px;\n}\nJS\n```\n$(document).on('click', '.lg-toogle-thumb', function()\n{\n  var sel = $('.lg-sub-html');\nif(sel.css('bottom') == '0px')\n   {\n      sel.animate({bottom: '100px'}, 'slow');\n   }\n   else\n   {\n      sel.css('bottom', '0px');\n   }  \n});\n```\nIt would be cool if you could do a pure CSS solution where it always sits on top of the thumbs, which could be done by editing the generated HTML a bit.\n. Cool, doh didn't notice the lg-thumb-open class!\n. Hi any update on this? Would be great to have :)\n. FireFox Version: 40.0.3 \nI seem to get no errors in firebug either. :(\n. Hmm, perhaps it's to do with how I have initiated the plugin as I am using $('body').lightGallery({selector: '.lightgallery'}); not sure.

Thanks for the quick fix, guys! :+1:  For reference, how would we reference the zoom image source in dynamicEl? It would be nice to be able to specify a zoom property.\n. @sachinchoolur Thanks for the info on zooming. The issue that I'm experiencing is that when the zoomed images are large (e.g., 1MB), then the gallery will take a long time to load since it's actually loading the zoomed image (dynamicEl.src) for the preview image as well.\nWhen not using the dynamic option, lightGallery uses $('a > img').attr('src') as the preview image source and $('a').attr('href') as the zoomed image source. It would be nice to replicate this when using the dynamic option by introducing a zoom property for the zoomed image source; then we can use the src property for the preview image source. I hope that makes sense.\n. Never mind, I discovered you have to use the 'selector' option when using this structure:\n$('#slider').lightGallery({\n  ...\n  selector: '#slider > li > a'\n});\n.

    "a1studmuffin": "Thanks @HarryVienna, your solution worked perfectly. For my site I had to change the selector to $('html') instead of $('body').\n. I'm also interested to know if there's a good solution for this. Since dynamic galleries are created on click events rather than on page load, it makes sense that lightgallery can't open a hash URL for a dynamically created gallery without some extra work. I imagine it's probably solvable with some javascript on document load, but my monkey brain can't quite put two sticks together to reach the food at the moment.\n. Okay, my monkey brain seems to have figured it out. On my page I have a single gallery view with several category filter buttons (eg. \"Ocean\", \"Landscape\", \"People\" etc.). Clicking a button changes which images are visible using isotope. When someone clicks on an image, I create a dynamic gallery based on which images are currently visible. I use the category as the galleryId, eg. \"show all\" is 0, \"ocean\" is 1, \"landscape\" is 2 etc. Since dynamic galleries aren't created at the time the page loads, you need a bit of javascript in your own code to display the gallery instead. At the end of my $(window).load function I've added this - you'll need to adapt to your specific site of course:\n```\n    // adapted from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript\n    function getParameterByName(name, url) {\n        if (!url) url = window.location.href;\n        name = name.replace(/[[]]/g, \"\\$&\");\n        var regex = new RegExp(\"[?&#]\" + name + \"(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)\"),\n            results = regex.exec(url);\n        if (!results) return null;\n        if (!results[2]) return '';\n        return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/+/g, \" \"));\n    }\n// lightgallery dynamic hash support: if url ends with \"#lg=X?slide=Y\", lets jump to the correct category filter by clicking the category button, and also optionally view the specified slide\nvar galleryIndexParam = parseInt(getParameterByName('lg'));\nif (!isNaN(galleryIndexParam))\n{\n    console.log('Setting gallery index to ' + galleryIndexParam);\n    // Click on the desired category filter button, which will update the isotope layout and hide a bunch of images by adding the 'isotope-hidden' class\n    $( \"#options .option-set\" ).children()[galleryIndexParam].click();\n\n    // Now check if a slide id was in the URL, if so, try and display that slide\n    var gallerySlideParam = parseInt(getParameterByName('slide'));\n    if (!isNaN(gallerySlideParam))\n    {\n        console.log('Setting gallery slide to ' + gallerySlideParam);\n        // Click on the desired slide\n        $container.children('.element').not('.isotope-hidden')[gallerySlideParam].click();\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe image click() function is what creates the dynamic gallery. It works a treat, though I've discovered a separate bug when a gallery hash URL is loaded in a fresh tab. But I can live with that for now.\n. I'm facing a similar issue at the moment (site offline so can't provide a working demo). I believe I may have tracked down the issue though. In lightgallery.js v1.2.21 on line 159 the line $('body').addClass('lg-on'); needs to be moved down a line so it's outside the setTimeout function. That way the check against 'lg-on' on line 171 works as expected. Fixed the issue for me anyway, hope that helps!\n. Awesome, thanks guys! :D\n. ",

You could use the onBeforeOpen event, or put in directly in your markup. \n. Hi, \nIndeed, except it just get me to the video page when I click. \nYou could use the onBeforeSlide event to check every time if $('.lg-current .lg-video') exists, and hide/show $('#lg-download') accordingly. \n. +1 behavior is kind of unexpected when clicking back button. Note that window.location.hash is used instead of History API (for compatibility reasons I presume). \nWhat you be great in my opinion is \"pushing\" the first hash, and \"replacing\" it (using History API or old school JS) on slide change, so that back button would still display original page (instead of previous site). Removing history on gallery close is not the better option  : it may create problems if back button is pushed before closing the gallery. \n@sachinchoolur would you be interested in a PR ? Any advice ? \n. Hi, \nNot sure if this would be a useful feature. Why don't you rotate your pictures in the first place ? \n. Hi, \nZoom does work with Dynamic mode, could you please post some code in a fiddle ? \n. @sachinchoolur You're welcome, glad to contribute to such a nice project ! \n. Hi, \nHard to help with your code formatting, but I can tell the slide() method does work. Could you post a JSFiddle to demonstrate ?\n. There is several issue in your code, but the general reason why it's not working is because the gallery instance has to be created (opened) before you can using methods on it. In your example you are basically trying to alter something that doesn't exist yet. \nThere is two ways for opening the gallery programmatically (ie not by clicking on a thumbnail) : triggering a click with jQuery or using Dynamic mode (see this answer). \nSo this would work : \nvar g = $('div.gallery');\nvar gallery = g.lightGallery({\n    selector: 'span.pic'\n});\n$('button').on('click', function(){\n    $('.start').trigger('click');\n    gallery.data('lightGallery').slide(2);\n});\nSee working example here. I added a \"start\" class to the first item in your html, but you could also give this class to the wanted item on the fly with jQuery : this would make the slide() call unnecessary and also get rid of the extra transition on the opening.\nOr you could use the Dynamic Mode and use the 'index' option. \nOn a side note, don't forget methods need to be called on the instance of the gallery, not the jQuery container (your \"g\" variable), that is why I added a \"gallery\" variable in my example.\n. You're right it can be a little confusing. Also yes I was wrong about the container ! Good luck. \n. Hello, \nWhat do you mean by \"calling manually\" ? \nYou can can have a look at the Dynamic mode demo here if that's what you're looking for : http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/dynamic.html\nIf not please post a code example. \n. Hi, \nLightgallery doesn't mind to add two items with the same destination (it can be useful). In your call you're telling it to take care of every element with rel=\"lightbox\", and that's what it does. \nYou can either remove rel=\"lightbox\" from one of your item, or put both of them in a new parent and select it with the 'selector' option. \n. If you wrap your two items in a new tag and link it to lightgallery it should work as expected (but it won't be pretty). Or you can use Dynamic mode and launch the gallery programmatically. \n. Don't forget to use the 'selector' option. Post a jsfiddle if you need more help. \n. Your last fiddle doesn't work because you're calling Lightgallery on .continer right on load, before it even exists in the DOM ! Put the init call anywhere where .continer is loaded and it works, see here : http://jsfiddle.net/nuLyryue/\n. By reading the linked example. Please close your issue. \n. This doesn't seem like a lightgallery problem, this question would be more suited in a general forum. In any case please learn to ask for help properly, it will help you to get useful answers. \n- 1 thread = 1 subject. Your original problem seems solved so you can close this issue, this will keep the project clean. \n- Image code is not an option, post a jsfiddle reproducing the problem.\n- People like words like hello and thanks.\nAbout what you posted, you should know that using setTimeout is most of the time a bad idea. You never now what will be the state of your code after X seconds on your users' computers. It can lead to weird problem like yours, dig this way. \n. What you could do is bind a click event to the fullscreen button and set css accordingly (untested but you get the idea): \n```\n$('body').on('click', '.lg-outer:not(.lg-fullscreen-on) .lg-fullscreen', function() {\n  $('.lg-backdrop').css('z-index', 10040);\n  $('.lg-outer').css('z-index', 10050);\n});\n$('body').on('click', '.lg-outer.lg-fullscreen-on .lg-fullscreen', function() {\n  // Back to default values\n  $('.lg-backdrop').css('z-index', 1040);\n  $('.lg-outer').css('z-index', 1050);\n});\n```\nYou could work with addClass() and removeClass() instead of setting CSS with jQuery, it would be more elegant. \nAlso note that the z-index max limit is 2147483647 for every browsers (even IE6) except Safari 3 (very old) which has a 16777271 limit. \n. Why don't you take it the other way, the one I showed you ? This would be a far more reliable mean to detect gallery opening and closing. \nSay your header has a z-index of 2000. Lightgallery has a 1040 and 1050 z-index, so you need to set them higher in order to cover it.\nIn Lightgallery CSS you have : \n.lg-backdrop {z-index:1040;}\n.lg-outer {z-index:1050;}\nJust add a new rule in your own css : \n.lg-backdrop.fullscreen {z-index:3040;}\n.lg-outer.fullscreen {z-index:3050;}\nNow you just have to add the fullscreen class to these elements when you need it, and they will go above your header : \n```\n// Fullscreen button is clicked when gallery is not fullscreen \n$('body').on('click', '.lg-outer:not(.lg-fullscreen-on) .lg-fullscreen', function() {\n  $('.lg-backdrop').addClass('fullscreen');\n  $('.lg-outer').addClass('fullscreen');\n});\n// Fullscreen button is clicked when gallery is already fullscreen \n$('body').on('click', '.lg-outer.lg-fullscreen-on .lg-fullscreen', function() {\n  // Back to default values\n  $('.lg-backdrop').removeClass('fullscreen');\n  $('.lg-outer').removeClass('fullscreen');\n});\n```\nYou should also remove the class when the gallery is closed (in case it is closed while fullscreen) using the onBeforeClose event. \nIf this doesn't solve the problem post a JSFiddle reproducing the problem. By the way jQuery .click() is deprecated, use .on() instead. \n. Ok great, if you consider your issue fixed please close it. \n. Hi, \nThanks for posting a well formatted question. You get a weird behavior because you're appending two elements for each image (hiddenimages and displayimage), why is that ? If you only use displayimage you get a correct behavior (btw be careful of the typo dispalyimage).\n. For your last question you wrote dispalyimage instead of displayimage.\nIt would be much easier to use the dynamic mode of Lightgallery so you don't have to struggle with HTML. Just fill an array with (at least) src and thumb and give it to the LG call.  This way gives a far more readable code :\nWorking example here. \n```\n\n\n\n\n\nvar album1 = [{\n                \"src\": 'http://lorempixel.com/500/300/city/1',\n                'thumb': 'http://lorempixel.com/100/100/city/1'\n            }, {\n                \"src\": 'http://lorempixel.com/500/300/city/2',\n                'thumb': 'http://lorempixel.com/100/100/city/2'\n            }, {\n                \"src\": 'http://lorempixel.com/500/300/city/3',\n                'thumb': 'http://lorempixel.com/100/100/city/3'\n            }];</p>\n<p>var album2 = [{\n                \"src\": 'http://lorempixel.com/500/300/animals/1',\n                'thumb': 'http://lorempixel.com/100/100/animals/1'\n            }, {\n                \"src\": 'http://lorempixel.com/500/300/animals/2',\n                'thumb': 'http://lorempixel.com/100/100/animals/2'\n            }, {\n                \"src\": 'http://lorempixel.com/500/300/animals/3',\n                'thumb': 'http://lorempixel.com/100/100/animals/3'\n            }];</p>\n<pre><code>$('#cover1').on('click', function() {\n    $('#galery-container1').lightGallery({\n        dynamic: true,\n        dynamicEl: album1\n    });\n});\n\n$('#cover2').on('click', function() {\n    $('#galery-container2').lightGallery({\n        dynamic: true,\n        dynamicEl: album2\n    });   \n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n``\n. There is anundefinedelement at the end ofhiddenimagesbecause ofi<=imagesarray.length;`.\ni must be strictly inferior (<) to the length of your array, no inferior/equal (<=), because array index always start at 0, not 1. In your code it looks for imagesarray[5], which does not exist, it is undefined, but the loop still adds HTML. \nAlso there is an undefined that appears in the result window  because you did not declare your  hiddenimages variable as a string before using +=. Use var hiddenimages = ''; instead of var hiddenimages;. \nFinally it is useless to define your displayimage every time in the loop. \nWhat I wanted to show you with my example is that the HTML your trying to inject (<a class\"hid\" href...) is useless, just let Lightgallery handle that with dynamic mode. By the way these are not multidimensional arrays, they are single arrays with a JS object inside.  You can fill it will any value you want. \n. No image code, never. \nAbout the diagram you posted, this exactly what I have setup in my example so I'm not sure I'm gonna help further. Check the selector option. \n. Another fix would be : \n.lg-outer .lg-thumb-item img {\n height: auto;\n}\nMaybe support is wider than object-fit. \n. Hi, \nYou can play with the absolute positioning of .lg-toolbar, maybe replace top with bottom in your CSS file. The close button (.lg-close) is nested inside it, so you will need to move it outside .lg-toolbar in the JS file and absolute position it to top/right. \n. Hi, \nEvents are meant to be used this way : \n```\n    var $lg = $('#lightgallery');\n$lg.lightGallery({\n  //init gallery with params \n});\n\n$lg.on('onCloseAfter.lg',function(event){\n  console.log('working');\n});\n\n```\nOn a side note be careful with location.reload, I can't think of a case where it's a good idea. \n. Hi,\nCould you show your html or better post a fiddle ? From the top of my head I think the error is due to the unconventional way you are populating the array. \n. Hi, \nFrom what I've seen hideControlOnEnd will work when 'loop' and 'slideEndAnimatoin' are both false. \n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n    hideControlOnEnd: true,\n    loop: false,\n    slideEndAnimatoin : false\n});\nThe typo on 'slideEndAnimatoin' is intended. \nNote that the controls won't be hidden, just disabled. You can add \n.lg-prev.lg-icon.disabled,\n.lg-next.lg-icon.disabled {\n    display:none;\n}\nto your CSS file to hide them. \n. Hi, \nZoom and pan function does work with Firefox (v44 Linux) on the demo page. Please post some code to get more help. \n. Hi, \nIt does work. Do you have any JS error in console ? \n. Since you didn't answer my question I've checked it myself, and there is indeed a JS error that prevent the gallery to work properly. This is because you opened the index file directly in the browser without using a webserver, and JS History API is disabled in Chrome when doing so, which triggers the error. Install a web server to properly work locally. \n. Hi, \nYou can trigger a click with jQuery : \n$('#mybutton').on('click', function() {\n   $('.first-item).trigger('click');\n});\n. Hi @sachinchoolur thanks for the proposal, I don't have a lot of free time but I'd be glad to help ! \n. Hi, \nClose button is supposed to work with iframes. The link to your code is broken, can you update it ? \n. Hello, \nYes this is supposed to work. Could you post a code example ? Thanks. \n. From your code I can't see how it is related to hash plugin. Does it work without it ? That said, the gallery should open. Do you have any error in console ? \n. Hi, \nIndeed. Waiting for a fix you can disable the scrollTop function when closing the gallery (as you may have noticed gallery is destroyed when appending a new item). Just comment out this line in the destroy method (around line 1230) : \n// $(window).scrollTop(_this.prevScrollTop);\n. Hi, \nThe selector used for LightGallery has to be the container of all your items, as seen on the basic demo. So your html can't work, since every gallery container (#lightgallery and .lightgallery2) has only one child each time. So the result you got is perfectly normal. On a side note be careful not to use twice the same id as it can easily break a lot of things ! \nSo you have two solutions : \n1- Proper markup\nHard to help you on this since we don't know what the result should be like, but basically you can put everything you want in a gallery item, and bind the click on it : \n<div id=\"lightgallery\">\n    <a href=\"/Giant_Image_1.jpg\" class=\"lightgallery-slide-item\">\n        <img src=\"/Small_Image_1.jpg\" />\n        <p><i class=\"fa fa-expand\"> Click to expand</p></i>\n    </a>\n    <a href=\"/Giant_Image_2.jpg\" class=\"lightgallery-slide-item\">\n        <img src=\"/Small_Image_2.jpg\" />\n        <p><i class=\"fa fa-expand\"> Click to expand</p></i>\n    </a>\n    <a href=\"/Giant_Image_3.jpg\" class=\"lightgallery-slide-item\">\n        <img src=\"/Small_Image_3.jpg\" />\n        <p><i class=\"fa fa-expand\"> Click to expand</p></i>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<script>\n    $(\"#lightgallery\").lightGallery({\n            selector: '.lightgallery-slide-item'\n        });\n</script>\nThis should work. \n2- Use Dynamic mode \nMost likely the easier solution. Populate the array with your data and use the index option to open the correct slide: \n<div id=\"lightgallery\">\n    <a class=\"item\" data-slide=\"1\">\n        <img src=\"/Small_Image_1.jpg\" />\n        <p><i class=\"fa fa-expand\"> Click to expand</p></i>\n    </a>\n    <a class=\"item\" data-slide=\"2\">\n        <img src=\"/Small_Image_2.jpg\" />\n        <p><i class=\"fa fa-expand\"> Click to expand</p></i>\n    </a>\n    <a class=\"item\" data-slide=\"3\">\n        <img src=\"/Small_Image_3.jpg\" />\n        <p><i class=\"fa fa-expand\"> Click to expand</p></i>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<script>\n    $(\".item\").on('click', function(){\n     var slideID = $(this).attr('data-slide');\n     $(\"#lightgallery\").lightGallery({\n               dynamic: true,\n               dynamicEl : myArray,\n               index : slideID\n        });\n   });\n</script>\n. Hi, \nThat will really be hard to implement. \n. @joaomarcosfg please post a fiddle with what you have so far. \n. Not tested but did you try using the Selector option ? Like \n$('#lightgallery').lightGallery({\n        selector: '.col-md-3'\n    });\nIn this case add another class so you don't have to use the Boostrap one (in case you change it later). Also just so you know your grid would still work as intended without the extra row markup, like \n```\n\n\nIMG\nIMG\nIMG\nIMG\nIMG\nIMG\nIMG\nIMG\n\n\n```\n. ",

I just tried this using the destroy and it still didn't work. \nI got this error: \nTypeError: $cl.data(...) is undefined\n$cl.data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\nThis is the code I used\n```\n$('.button').click(function(e){ \n    e.preventDefault();\n    var $cl = $(this).lightGallery({\n        download : false,\n        counter: false,\n        dynamic: true,\n        escKey: false,\n        dynamicEl: [{\n            \"src\": 'http://google.com',\n            'iframe' : true\n        }]\n    });     \n$cl.on('onCloseAfter.lg',function(event, index, fromTouch, fromThumb){  \n    //$cl.data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\n    //$(this).data('lightGallery').destroy(true);\n});\n\n});\n```\n.

Is there no way to destroy the lightgallery on close? \nAs I am finding using this example http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/demos/dynamic.html on a class selector, every time a different button is clicked a new lightgallery opens a new instance, as a result any function ran in the close event also runs multiple times.\nIs there no easy way to just destroy the lightgallery on close?\n.

I don't suppose there's a way around that?\n. One last question. I have image captions which are fairly long and which include other links. These captions sit below the images and therefore fall between the anchor tags as demonstrated in kursusHC's \"Option 1 - Proper markup\" above. The issue seems to be that these links are breaking the container's link (and obviously it's poor form to have links within links). Any suggestions what I could do to prevent this?\nI would be happy to have the secondary links only clickable when the gallery is opened (so when they are showing as just the captions before the user clicks to initiate lightGallery, the links are muted, however when viewing the large image they are clickable) but obviously including them as part of the 'data-sub-html' is breaking things because it's output just the same.\n.

    "lisaschiffli": "I think I am experiencing the same problem. Same version of Chrome running on Windows 10. The Youtube/Vimeo with Posters Demo does not work now and it did a few weeks ago. The Youtube/Vimeo without Posters Demo works. Also, the website n0xx posted does not work for me either. However, both the Demo and his website work with Firefox for me. I'm continuing to try to debug and find the cause. (Edited to add: When the Demo worked, I was running Windows 8)\n. Debugging on my project shows that it seems to work until clicking on the play video button. On Firefox, that's where \"loadOnClick\" is called from the if stmt around line 159 in lg-video.js. The alert I have inserted never fires on Chrome. Nothing happens when the play video button is clicked. I have disabled all chrome extensions and also tried incognito mode and it still doesn't work. I will try to put together a jsfiddle later. \nif (_this.core.doCss() && _this.core.$items.length > 1 && ((_this.core.s.enableSwipe && _this.core.isTouch) || (_this.core.s.enableDrag && !_this.core.isTouch))) {\n        _this.core.$el.on('onSlideClick.lg.tm', function() {\n            var $el = _this.core.$slide.eq(_this.core.index);\n            alert('calling loadOnClick');\n            loadOnClick($el);\n        });\n    } else {  etc...\n. I think I've found the problem. Chrome is not correctly detecting touch screen devices under Windows 10. There is a flag in Chrome under chrome://flags for Enable Touch Events. By default it is set to \"Automatic.\" There are also \"Disabled\" and \"Enabled\" options. I have a standard laptop with no touch screen; however, Chrome reports touchscreen is True. The _this.core.isTouch variable reports True in lg. If I change the flag in Chrome to \"disable\", the LightGallery Demo and my website both work fine. The \"show-stopping\" problem is that I can't require all my page visitors to set their Chrome flag to make my site work. \nAdditionally, I have another Win10 laptop running Chrome that does have touch capability along with mouse usage. The lg YouTube Demo will only work by touching. The mouse does not work to click on the Play button on the video poster. On a device with both touch and mouse, either should work.\nI also tested Chrome on a touch only smartphone (LG V10) and the lg Demo almost works. The video loads when you tap the play button on the poster, but the video doesn't start to play. You have to tap another play button that displays when the YouTube video is loaded. \nSpecifically, in the code, when lg thinks touch is True, the mouse events don't seem to be triggering. Alerts placed in any of the $(window).on('mouse...') events don't fire when the mouse is clicked. For example, somewhere around line 1135 in lightgallery.js..\n$(window).on('mouseup.lg', function(e) {\n                if (isMoved) {\n                    isMoved = false;\n                    _this.touchEnd(endCoords - startCoords);\n                    _this.$el.trigger('onDragend.lg');\n                } else if ($(e.target).hasClass('lg-object') || $(e.target).hasClass('lg-video-play')) {\n                    alert('trigger onSlideClick.lg');\n                    _this.$el.trigger('onSlideClick.lg');\n                }\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure how you resolve this. Way beyond my current jQuery and web skills. Somehow lg needs accurate info about the device capabilities: mouse, touch or both and that depends on line 100 in lightgallery.js \n```\n        // To determine browser supports for touch events;\n        this.isTouch = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement);\n```\n.

Putting html structure within the data-attribute is certainly the least preferable way because of possible encoding problemens and readability. You allow to put a class within the data-sub-html attribute, but with the current code it doens't make sense to use classes which propably exist multiple times. JQuery selects classes with the DOM method getElementsByClassName (at least v3) and more complex queries with querySelectorAll and and not standardized selectors with the sizzle query language;) I work with a large CMS system and a few programmers. For me my markup was easier to use because i know it will work without my intervention because nobody has to change the markup for example to generate random id's for each template where my markup is being used. There are a lot of different CMS elements programmed by different people where this could cause problems and additional template code and explanations. If you don't like the second data attribute it's also possible to pass it as a option parameter like the selector. Therefore for me it was more confortable to use my markup. Whatever you decide, keep up the good work!;) best wishes Karl\n. ",

According to the documentation it is possible to pass a selector when initializing the lightgallery ( documentation link ) .\nI think in your case you could just pass a selector searching for the 'a' tags inside the gallery.

I seemed like lightgallery is figuring out the image gallery with href tag on a children elements of $('#lightgallery'). That means if any element under $('#lightgallery') has href tag that says the path of images, it will work fine. Thus,  I put href attribute in div tag! \nInterestingly, I solve the problem with the code below!\n<div id='lightgallery'>\n    <div class='I WANT THIS GUY!' href='THIS HREF TAG ON DIV SOLVED MY PROBLEM!'>\n        <img src='path to thumbnail image'></img>\n    </div>\n</div>\nThanks again @catwiththreehats.

If the user has JavaScript disabled, or he opens the image in a new browsertab, he will open just an image file.

While offsetWidth returns the width before applying css transform(), getBoundingClientRect() returns the real width of image after applying css transform(). Therefore, lightGallery wasn't able to fix the offset after zooming.\nI fixed this issue by replacing .width() and .height() with .prop(\"offsetWidth\") and .prop(\"offsetHeight\") inside the zoom function of lg-zoom.js line 69-97.\n```\n/\n * @desc Image zoom\n * Translate the wrap and scale the image to get better user experience\n \n * @param {String} scaleVal - Zoom decrement/increment value\n /\nvar zoom = function(scaleVal) {\nvar $image = _this.core.$outer.find('.lg-current .lg-image');\nvar _x;\nvar _y;\n\n// Find offset manually to avoid issue after zoom\nvar offsetX = ($(window).width() - $image.prop(\"offsetWidth\")) / 2;\nvar offsetY = (($(window).height() - $image.prop(\"offsetHeight\")) / 2) + $(window).scrollTop();\n\n_x = _this.pageX - offsetX;\n_y = _this.pageY - offsetY;\n\nvar x = (scaleVal - 1) * (_x);\nvar y = (scaleVal - 1) * (_y);\n\n$image.css('transform', 'scale3d(' + scaleVal + ', ' + scaleVal + ', 1)').attr('data-scale', scaleVal);\n\n$image.parent().css({\n    left: -x + 'px',\n    top: -y + 'px'\n}).attr('data-x', x).attr('data-y', y);\n\n};\n```\n.

When I replace the JS reference back to the previous version, it does not hang forever during loading, but sometimes misses displaying the first photo. . Followup, after running many test cases. This is what I'm seeing consistently. If it helps. Using the previous release, the first invoke of the gallery (button click) all slides, works great. On the second invoke, even on a high speed network, loading animation and first slide is skipped.

OK, so I believe it is the inner workings of what I am trying to o with my app that's messing it up.\nBasically I load a page, then jQuery looks at the URL and does something with it to load dynamic content on the page. So if my URL contains \"tags\" (e.g. www.mysite.com/tag1/tag2/) it will then do an AJAX request to load dynamic gallery based on tags.\nSo when I go to a URL with a hash in it (e.g. www.mysite.com/tag1/tag2/#lg=1&slide=0) then the I still need to load the dynamic gallery first based on tags, BUT then somehow loadup the lightGallery lightbox on top, so if the user then closes the lightbox, the correct gallery is showing.\nSo in some sort of psuedo code:\nif (window.location.hash != \"\") { load dynamic gallery first and then display lightbox}\n\nAny idea how to achieve this please? . Not sure if this is the best place to post more questions related to this...? But...\nSo commented out the lines you suggested stops the URL from loosing the hash...but the lightbox does not appear, even though there is a hash in the URL...Obviously it is my code not being correct, but I am creating a working dynamic gallery...it just doesn't open the lightbox until an item is clicked...\nI am not a coder by profession so i am surely making mistakes with my code.. Thank you for the response...\nhmm I get as far as detecting if hash exists in the URL, but not sure how to trigger a click on a link that has no specific id. lightGallery doesn't require me to have unique ids. \nI would love to show you my code as I hope it was obvious to you what I am doing wrong/badly.

If you use just the filedist/js/lightgallery-all.js`, replace the code at line 1654:\n\njavascript\n    Fullscreen.prototype.exitFullscreen = function() {\n        if (isFullScreen()) {\n            if (document.exitFullscreen) {\n                document.exitFullscreen();\n            } else if (document.msExitFullscreen) {\n                document.msExitFullscreen();\n            } else if (document.mozCancelFullScreen) {\n                document.mozCancelFullScreen();\n            } else if (document.webkitExitFullscreen) {\n                document.webkitExitFullscreen();\n            }\n        }\n    };\n. I'm sorry! My code solve other issue (the same error, but trying close the gallery)\nCan you post a example code to reproduce the error and try help you?. It's simple to solve. Just call the method event.preventDefault(); into the 'click' function.\nExample:\njavascript\n      $('#btnVerFotos').on('click', function(event) {\n        event.preventDefault();\n        $('#first-item').trigger('click');\n      });\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/vbwxBv?editors=1000.
