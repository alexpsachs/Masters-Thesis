    "cagataycivici": "Thank you @sidahmedbenkhaoua!!!\n. Could you please post your questions to PrimeNG forum?\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35\n. Have you tried npm install?\n. On windows, we had a similar issue. I'll update the wiki, thanks.\n. Please use PrimeNG forum for questions;\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35\n. It is scheduled for 0.5+\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. Will be available on 29th of February.\n. Thank you, is there an example slider somewhere that has a scale?\n. Thank you, there is also;\nhttp://simeydotme.github.io/jQuery-ui-Slider-Pips/\n. Let's track at https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/118\n. Issue tracker cleanup, moved to roadmap. Will reopen when it is picked up from our todo list.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. Issue tracker cleanup, moved to roadmap. Will reopen when it is picked up from our todo list.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. Available in 4.1.\n\n. Available for beta6.\n. Issue tracker cleanup, moved to roadmap. Will reopen when it is picked up from our todo list.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. We'll discuss it this for next week's 0.5 release, thank you for the feedback.\n. Right now we are experimenting a webpack+primeng started based on commonjs, it will be ready in 1-2 weeks, it is likely that 0.6 will be based on systemjs before the switch. Note that PrimeNG releases are weekly.\n. PrimeNG now compiles to commonjs. We also have plans to create a new starter sample alternative with webpack, as current one uses system.js\n. PrimeNG is not designed for JSF, PrimeFaces is exclusive for JSF and PrimeNG does the same for Angular2. For the other frameworks, there are generic PrimeUI with its PrimeElements companion.\n. We're investigating, could be an issue with angular beta as well.\n. Just wondering, have you tried running angular2-quickstart on IE9, we've based the showcase on it.\n. Thanks, we'll add that one for now.\n. Should be fixed now.\n. In future, I guess we'll remove it but we've tuned PrimeUI widgets for PrimeNG so they work in harmony. So we'll keep it for the time being.  Please see jQuery section at setup page for details;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/setup\njQuery in enhanced mode only does low level things like positioning, class add remove, no dom manipulation. This ensures great level of compatibility.\nStill we write some of the components natively, like datatable, checkbox, radio, messages and more will be native along the way.\n. Do you get typings folder created?\n. Currently it is scheduled for 0.8;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\nWe'll also have TreeTable soon as 0.8 is planned for match 21st.\n. Available in 0.8.0, will post the link here later today for the demo and docs.\n. http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/tree\n. DragDrop is available now for 4.0.RC1;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/683. 4.0.0-RC2. Is it possible for you to send us the project so we can check locally?\n. Missing feedback so closing.\n. Should be issue 80.\n. Welcome to PrimeNG, there is column based filtering;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatablefilter\nSo you need a global filter as well like in PrimeFaces?\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/data/datatable/filter.xhtml\n. Missing feedback so closing.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks, dialog typo is fixed now and we'll redo button as native component in 0.7 so not merging that part. Thank you.\n. See #81 please.\n. Fixed now, thank you.\n. We've managed to replicate and will be fixed for 0.7.0.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/706bcd88cd75a3d9e446e8e602c37a5233a90240\n. Do you have jquery ui datepicker included on your page?\n. The ones in npm is a modified version to be used with a common loader, since you use script tags, you need the original ones, here are the links;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/showcase/resources/js/jquery.js\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/showcase/resources/js/jquery-ui.js\njquery.js is nothing special, jquery-ui.js is shrinked version that contains only what is necessary like core+datepicker. Please try with these files.\n. Please also see;\nhttp://blog.npmjs.org/post/112064849860/using-jquery-plugins-with-npm\n. Glad to hear!\n. We've done some changes lately on primeui site of things to generate primeui-ng.css and primeui-ng.js that basically includes everything ng needs to avoid issues like this one in future. Documentation will also be updated tomorrow with 0.7.\n. It will be same as;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeui/#datatableExpansion\nor\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/data/datatable/expansion.xhtml\nExpanded area will be based on a user defined template that gets the rowdata as a variable.\n. Ready for 1.0.0-beta.3\n\n. We'll do it, thank you.\n. Blocked by;\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8292\n. Figured out a way to do it finally. \n. Field data of a corresponding row is displayed as the cell content by default, this can be customized using templating where the implicit variable passed to the template is the column definition and data of current row is the rowData property. In addition index of the current can be accessed using the optional rowIndex variable. Similarly, custom content can be placed at the header and footer of a column with templating.\nA template inside a column must be decorated with pTemplate directive along with the type property to indicate where the template belongs to. Possible values are \"header\", \"body\" and \"footer\".\nxml\n<p-column field=\"color\" header=\"Color\">\n    <template let-col #car=\"rowData\" #ri=\"rowIndex\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n        <span\">{{car[col.field]}}</span>\n    </template>\n</p-column>\n<p-column>\n    <template pTemplate type=\"header\">\n        <button type=\"button\" pButton (click)=\"selectAllCars()\" icon=\"fa-check\"></button>\n    </template>\n    <template let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n        <button type=\"button\" pButton (click)=\"selectCar(car)\" icon=\"fa-search\"></button>\n    </template>\n</p-column>\n. Yes we have plans indeed to make common tasks easier. Thanks for your feedback and creating the issue.\n. Will be available next week with 1.0.0-beta.1\n. Implemented gmap with common features like events, overlays and so on.\n. Please try with clearing your cache. It works for me.\n. Thank you.\n. We've done it for PrimeFaces before, it will be more or less similar;\nAdvanced\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/file/upload/single.xhtml\nBasic\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/file/upload/basic.xhtml\n. Scheduled for beta14 (next one). FileUpload has the highest priority now.\n. Almost done with it.\n. Issue tracker cleanup, moved to roadmap. Will reopen when it is picked up from our todo list.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. Expanding the context so that users can control the state of datatable by updating the model values bound do page-sort-filter attributes such as resetting first or clearing sort field.\n. Thank you, we'll do it for sure.\n. Issue is too common, we'll create a ticket for each one.\n. Issue tracker cleanup, moved to roadmap. Will reopen when it is picked up from our todo list.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. It works for me online, maybe a cache issue?\n. In fact, we do very soon.\n. Assigned to @Mrtcndkn \n. Please review;\nhttps://github.com/Mrtcndkn/primeng-quickstart\n. Better to ask the repo owners.. Welcome to PrimeNG, you also need to add charts.js to your page.\n. Yes;\njson\n \"scripts\": [\n          \"../node_modules/chart.js/dist/Chart.js\",\n          //..others\n      ],\nAdded this info to chart docs as well.. It works for me;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/ultima-ng/#/charts. Added manually\n. This is available now for 0.9.\nxml\n<p-accordionTab>\n    <header>\n        Header Content\n    </header>\n    Body Content\n</p-accordionTab>\n. What is your version?\n. Please try with 0.8.2 as this looks same as\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/127\n. Instead of a new component, I've used the new multiselect component and created a demo at DataTable Showcase, here is how it looks like until it is deployed online.\n\n. Fixed via #159 \n. The link seems broken?\n. By toggle tr do you mean row expansion?\n. Oh I see, we already have something similar, check out the reflow please;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatableresponsive\nIf you reduce the width of the window, datatable goes in card mode. I guess we can add a class to make this mode toggleable for large screens as well, what do you think?\n. I've added stacked property and added a demo for it using a button where clicking the button toggles the stacked value so the datatable switches between tabular and card layout.\n. Yes, the css is in PrimeUI so will be available with upcoming PrimeUI 4.2 that PrimeNG 1.0.0-beta.1 uses. CSS is shared between these two and it is distributed in PrimeUI.\n. Do you mean like the first datatable at;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/data/datatable/edit.xhtml\n. Comments have different requirements and request is not clear. Moved the request to roadmap called row based editing, will pick it up and create a new ticket later after 1.0.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\n. Our estimate is within 2 months.. Could you please clarify what do you mean by skip metadata field?\n. Welcome, we use next for all components until now and will migrate to emit in next release. We'll do a find-replace to replace all so not merging the pr now. Thank you for the feedback.\nThe issue is;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/147\n. Dropdown is done as it is reimplemented as a native component.\n. readonlyInput for calendar fixes this.. What is the issue? I couldn't understand.\nHave you included font awesome?\n. Glad to hear.\n. Hi,\nClicked where? Its target?\n. I've added toggle() method for this, so that if panel is visible, toggle hides it. Signature is same as show so you just need to replace show with toggle. show still remains for cases where you always want to show it.\n. Looks like a bug, being worked on.\n. Oh, you mean going up, but the load is only called when going down with scroller. It should not be called when scrolling up to view already loaded elements.\n. This seems like the expected behavior for me.. Available via url option;\nxml\n<p-splitButton label=\"Save\" icon=\"fa-check\" (onClick)=\"save()\">\n        <p-splitButtonItem icon=\"fa-close\" label=\"Delete\" (onClick)=\"delete()\"></p-splitButtonItem>\n        <p-splitButtonItem icon=\"fa-refresh\" label=\"Update\" (onClick)=\"update()\"></p-splitButtonItem>\n        <p-splitButtonItem icon=\"fa-link\" label=\"Angular.io\" url=\"http://angular.io\"></p-splitButtonItem>\n        <p-splitButtonItem icon=\"fa-paint-brush\" label=\"Theming\" [url]=\"['Theming']\"></p-splitButtonItem>\n    </p-splitButton>\n. Yes, we'll have it for 1.0.0-beta.1 due april 11. It will be like the ones with time;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/input/calendar.xhtml\n. Almost done\n\n. Available now for 1.0.0-beta.1\n. rowsPerPage has been added a couple of days ago so not released yet, it will be available in 1.0.0-beta.1 due april 11 so you can use this feature.\nAbout displaying current page, we should do it as a built-in feature because we have it in PrimeFaces, called CurrentPageReportTemplate=\"{0} of {1}\" where 0 is current page and 1 is total number of pages.\nI've updated title of this issue and we'll do it very soon.\n. Not sure what you mean by dynamic data?\n. It is a commercial product, our open source license will not allow to use the Scheduler module I'm afraid.\n. Yes, you are right, fixed now. Thank you!\n. I know but I see this as a matter of preference, multiple=\"false\" also enables multiple mode which might be confusing to users we decided on [multiple]=\"true\".\n. Thank you\n. Please see ContextMenu section at;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable\n. We'll discuss this and get back to you.\n. We'll try to do it after 1.0.0-beta.1. PrimeFaces has it so PrimeNG should as well.\n. Let's track at #196 \n. Thanks for the idea, we first need to #103 though.\n. You also need to update the primeui to current dev version. I do it manually by copying files to node_modules of primeng now, I'd suggest waiting for beta1 though as we'll release primeng 1.0 beta 1 along with compatible primeui 4.2.\nSo quick workaround is cloning primeui, running gulp build-all, copying primeui-ng-all.min.css and primeui-ng-all.min.js to node_modules/primeui or wait for april 11 for the releases. Dev is not super stable nowadays.\n. Yes, we are indeed!\n. We'll see what we can do and give an update.\n. I've grouped all localized keys under locale object;\nxml\n<p-schedule [events]=\"events\" [locale]=\"es\"></p-schedule>\n``` ts\nexport class MyModel {\nes: any;\n\nngOnInit() {\n    this.es = {\n        monthNames: ['Enero', 'Febrero', 'Marzo', 'Abril', 'Mayo', 'Junio', 'Julio',\n            'Agosto', 'Septiembre', 'Octubre', 'Noviembre', 'Diciembre']\n    };\n}\n\n}\n```\n. You need to use ngModel instead of value.\nxml\n<p-dropdown [options]=\"col.possibleEntries\" [(ngModel)]=\"row[col.field]\"></p-dropdown>\nAll inputs now use ngModel so this is a breaking change from 0.x version to 1.0.\n. Thank you.\n. I see, working on it.\n. Please use forum for how-to like questions. Thank you.\n. Added for 1.0.0.beta.2\n. Glad to hear!\n. DataTable cells have overflow: hidden, you can make this work by;\nxml\n<p:column style=\"overflow:visible\">\n   <template>\n       <p-dropdown>\nSo that dropdown overlay can be displayed fully.\n. I'm unable to replicate;\nxml\n       <p-column field=\"color\" header=\"Color\" style=\"overflow:visible\">\n            <template #col #car=\"rowData\">\n                <p-dropdown [options]=\"cities\"></p-dropdown>\n            </template>\n        </p-column>\n\n. This is a regular table right? Not scrollable.\n. Ok, we'll check. Reopening.\n. Fixed on PrimeUI side as css of datatable is there by removing overflow auto from ui-datatable-wrapper.\n. This is expected, for example please see;\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=45113\nI'd suggest;\nxml\n<p-dropdown [autoWidth]=\"false\" style=\"width:100%\">\nor\nxml\n<p-dropdown style=\"width:100%\">\n. Taking ownership.\n. We've done it for PrimeFaces before and will definitely work on it for PrimeNG for beta8. http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/data/datatable/filter.xhtml\n. We're trying to figure out the best way to do this.\n. We'll work on it for 1.0.2.. \n. Could it be handled on app side? We'd like to avoid complicating tabview.\n. Better handled on app side probably with tab change events, it is a bit our of scope of tabview component.. You need to use the [] syntax not ()\n. It would be better to ask this as angular2-webpack-starter project tracker. We don't ship ts files by the way.\n. Do you have primeui-ng-all.min.js on page?\n. #206 fixes this as well.\n. See #206 please.\n. Should be mid next week.\n. Yes it will break due to some breaking changes in beta 17 so at least beta 17 is required.\n. Sure we will add at least symbol for next primeng beta releas3. Thanks for your feedback. \n. Try beta3 please.\n. Can you try with beta2?\n. Replicated, it happens after sorting again though for me like filter+sort is ok but sorting again displays full list.\n. Please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/206\n. Documentation error, there is no location attribute. It should be based on viewport height, where do you want it to be located instead of center of page?\n. Do you have an image in a dialog? Or something that is displayed after dialog is displayed?\n. I can't replicate this at showcase;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/dialog\nWhat is your PrimeUI version, positioning is currently done by PrimeUI Dialog.\n. Strange, in my tests that style wasn't required. I'll reopen if more users have this. One last thing, do you have doctype on your page?\n. Great!\n. Sounds good. Maybe we can add sortFunction;\nxml\n<p-column sortable=\"custom\" (sortFunction)=\"customSort($event)\"\nSimilar to #196\n. Please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/206\n. It works for me, for example;\nxml\nminWidth=\"500\" width=\"600\"\nI can't resize less than 500.\n. What is your min-width?\n. Can you also set width=\"500\"\n. Default width is 300 so min-width should be less or equal to width.\n. Will review and give an update.\n. I guess you also need to add Slider to directives;\ntypescript\ndirectives: [InputText,Slider]\n. Will review and give an update.\n. Let's do it for RC4.\n. @Luchillo Not that I know of yet.\nBtw, do you have;\n<script src=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.js\"></script>\nResize part uses our resize plugin, that is not converted to native javascript yet.\n. Reopening, in next version we'll probably implement this as native without jquery.\n. This is fixed in;\n206\nPlease try with 1.0.0-beta.3\n. Welcome, I think you miss,\nxml\n<script src=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.js\"></script>\nPlease see setup section at;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/setup\n. Good to hear, thank you.\n. We have a hidden select tag inside, I'll add required to it.\n. We'll checr the upcoming modena (next week), thank you.\ncc @mertsincan @Mrtcndkn \n. We're unable to replicate I'm afraid.\n. There is reset method that does this. See methods section;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable\nAlso we can expose filters metadata so that you can clear it yourself from model instead of getting datatable instance.\n. As of 2.0.x, reset also clears filters.\n```typescript\npublic reset() {\n        this.sortField = null;\n        this.sortOrder = 1;\n    this.filteredValue = null;\n    this.filters = {};\n\n    if(this.paginator) {\n        this.paginate({\n            first: 0,\n            rows: this.rows\n        });\n    }\n    else {\n        this.updateDataToRender(this.value);\n    }\n}\n\n```. We'll do it for beta4 in a couple of days. Please monitor this ticket. Right now workaround is defining a selectionMode and use onRowSelect event.\n. I'm confused do you use autocomplete with dropdown option enabled or using p-dropdown?. What is the problem with { label: 'Select X', value: '' }? Isn't it how it's done with a native select element as well?. Got it, thanks for the pointer. I've added placeholder property for this functionality.. What is your PrimeNG version?\n. Yes, we've fixed that in beta.3. Thank you for the update.\n. I can't think of a way to do it right now without the router apis so updated the docs. Thank you.\n. Definitely, please see previously created #52.\n. Yes, these are not supported yet for scrollable tables but they will be.\n. Tracking at 1005.\n. Create a new ticket please with a sample, I just did for example;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2890. Moved to roadmap.\n. Please use forum for how-to like questions.\nhttps://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35. A real solution is being worked on however quick solution is to move the expansion template before the columns.\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=45226\n. A safer check is added, so that it works regardless of the location.\n. I'm not sure about the best way to add support for beforeShowDay yet to customize day rendering. I'd appreciate your feedback.\n. I'm unable to replicate.\n. Will check again, last time it worked for me.. I couldn't replicate again.. Dialog is reimplemented as a native widget (no jquery-primeui anymore) and minimize maximizable are left out initially so this doesn't apply anymore. When we re-add them, we'll consider this case as well.\n. Please include;\n\nFrom PrimeUI\nHopefully in beta4, we'll break this dependency.\n. Upgrade to a newer primeng version please.\n. Please use forum for questions, you need to add full calendar to your application.\nhttp://fullcalendar.io/download/\n. Please remove your jquery and only include;\n<script src=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.js\"></script>\n. It is probably because of Electron, we also faced with it but could not find enough time to provide a sample with electron. I'll ask my colleague to work on this to setup a quickstart with electron.\n@Mrtcndkn Please take over.\n. TreeNode is not a directive, it is an interface so you need to remove it from directives.\n. Got it, thanks.\n. There is a big problem though;\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8275\n. Ok, fixed the problem by the suggested workaround so we fully support beta16 now with PrimeNG beta4.\n. This is available in PrimeNG 2.x.. It should be supported, I will check.. Ok, I'm confused, when I provide a json like this by modifying showcase;\n{\n    \"data\":\n    [  \n        {  \n            \"data\":{  \n                \"name\":\"Documents\",\n                \"size\":\"75kb\",\n                \"type\":\"Folder\"\n            },\n            \"expanded\": true,\n            \"children\":[\n                {  \n                    \"data\":{  \n                        \"name\":\"Work\",\n                        \"size\":\"55kb\",\n                        \"type\":\"Folder\"\n                    },\n                    \"children\":[  \n                        {  \n                            \"data\":{  \n                                \"name\":\"Expenses.doc\",\n                                \"size\":\"30kb\",\n                                \"type\":\"Document\"\n                            }\n                        },\n                        {  \n                            \"data\":{  \n                                \"name\":\"Resume.doc\",\n                                \"size\":\"25kb\",\n                                \"type\":\"Resume\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                {  \n                    \"data\":{  \n                        \"name\":\"Home\",\n                        \"size\":\"20kb\",\n                        \"type\":\"Folder\"\n                    },\n                    \"children\":[  \n                        {  \n                            \"data\":{  \n                                \"name\":\"Invoices\",\n                                \"size\":\"20kb\",\n                                \"type\":\"Text\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n       //other nodes\n}\nDocuments node is rendered as expanded initially;\n\nSo what is the issue here? If you set a node as expanded programmatically, following also works, notice that I toggle the expanded with an external button click;\n```xml\nToggle\n<p-treeTable [value]=\"files1\">\n    <p-header>Basic</p-header>\n    <p-column field=\"name\" header=\"Name\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"size\" header=\"Size\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"type\" header=\"Type\"></p-column>\n</p-treeTable>\n\n```\n```\nngOnInit() {\n    this.nodeService.getFilesystem().then(files => this.files1 = files);\n}\ntoggleNode() {\n   this.files1[0].expanded = !this.files1[0].expanded;\n}\n```\nClicking the button collapses or expands the first node (documents). . We've replicated this and being worked on.\n. @Mrtcndkn New native galleria should fix this, please test and confirm.\n. Great idea, we'll check this. Thanks. In PrimeFaces, we can export to pdf, csv, xml and excel so PrimeNG should have some sort of export as well.\n. Can you please clarify, I don't see it;\n\nThe one with dropdown has ui-autocomplete-dd at container span that adds padding for room for button. Autocomplete without dropdown, doesn't have this in my tests. \n. Fixed via;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/275\n. Our bad, the demo source and the actual code doesn't match, actual code has sticky enabled. Fixed in code now and will be live soon in redeploy. Thank you.\n. This is due to a breaking change in beta 16;\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8275\nSo you need to use angular 2 beta 15 with primeng 1.0 beta3.\nprimeng 1.0 beta4. will support beta 16;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/260\n. Great idea, could you please provide a pull request as an example for us? Should we add this to primeng.ts at root folder? \n. Kinda invalid now as RC5 introduced modules.\n. Please see;\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=45287\nand\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/260\nIn summary, upcoming beta4 adds support for angular2 beta16.\n. Which project are you building? Your own? or PrimeNG itself?\n. Replace peerDependencies with;\njson\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"angular2\": \"2.0.0-beta.16\",\n    \"systemjs\": \"0.19.26\",\n    \"es6-shim\": \"^0.35.0\",\n    \"reflect-metadata\": \"0.1.2\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"5.0.0-beta.2\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.6.12\",\n    \"primeui\": \"4.1.8\"\n  },\nThen do;\nnpm install\ntypings install\ntsc\nnpm start\n. This is on purpose, as we publish to npm from this project, don't need to publish dependencies as it is suggested to use peerDependencies when publishing a module.\n. Thank you, I'm not sure some of them like displaying suggestions when revisiting, for other we'll make some changes based on your feedback. Thank you.\n. Do you have custom z-indexes in your dialog, what are the ancestors of p-dialog? Do they have z-index? \n. Is it possible to send us the whole page code?\n. Please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/656\n. xml\n<p-dialog appendTo=\"body\"\nshould fix this.\n. There is rowsPerPage property that displays a dropdown with available options.\n. I think it is quite complex and not a common requirement. If there is more demand in future, we'll reopen. Thank you for your feedback.\n. Dup of #282 \n. Doesn't it appear at all?\n. No, as it is based on file system behavior where you need a key to multi select.\n. Thank you for the pr after discussion, we've decided to wait for more user requests of this same requirement to proceed. So let's keep this issue open and wait for new votes.\n. Thank you.\n. Thank you.\n. See my comment at 284 please.\n. Try replacing peerDependencies at package.json with;\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"angular2\": \"2.0.0-beta.17\",\n    \"systemjs\": \"0.19.26\",\n    \"es6-shim\": \"^0.35.0\",\n    \"reflect-metadata\": \"0.1.2\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"5.0.0-beta.6\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.6.12\"\n    \"primeui\": \"4.1.8\"\n  },\nWe'll release beta on monday by the way.\n. What are your Angular2, PrimeNG versions?\n. I'm not sure really, for the past few weeks there had been many changes to Angular2.\n. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1869 fixes this.. We'll consider this in upcoming Ultima, Rio-Modena-Adamantium are in maintenance mode so new features won't implemented. You'll get access to Ultima once it is released in 2 weeks.\n. Will check for beta.6.\n. 1296 will enable the second part where you can hide the expander icon, not sure about first request, will reconsider if more users demand it.\n. Can you post your dialog code please?\n. So to clarify, if the table is sorted already and the data is changed by you, you want the table to sort the new data? I believe we can do it.\n. Ok, we'll do it then.\n. Added default sortOrder as asc to fix this. Thank you.\n. You also need primeui-ng-all.min.js from primeui as panelmenu is one of the remaining components that have a dependency to a primeui js widget.\n. Dialog is a native component, panelMenu still depends on primeui js for the time being until we redo the menu components as native soon.\n. Have you imported jquery as well? primeui-ng-all.min.js has jquery in it so if you have two jquerys, it will fail.\n. PanelMenu is a native component so as of beta6 you won't need this script anymore to use PanelMenu.\n. This is on roadmap;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\nClosing for now and will create a new ticket with details when we pick it up from roadmap after 1.0. \nAt the moment, we're closing tickets that duplicate the upcoming features in roadmap as a part of issue tracker maintenance.\n. Planned for 2.1 due late march.. Similar to PrimeFaces TableState;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/data/datatable/tableState.xhtml. Yes, but can't give a specific date right now. Rough estimation is in 2 months.. Yes, there are events to use until this is built-in.. Scheduled for 6.1.. Yes we'll work on it for 7.0. It will be one of the highlight of 7.0 in terms of new stuff.. This is happening but should we use sessionstorage, localstorage or a service for this? We can't decide over here :). Any ideas?. In progress.... Implemented now, usage is simple as defining stateStorage to selected where to keep it e..g sessionStorage or localStorage along with the state key;\nxml\n<p-table[columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"cars\" stateStorage=\"session | local\" stateKey=\"key1\">\nCurrently supported features that can be stateful are;\n\npage\nsort\nfilter\nselection\ncolumn resize\ncolumn reorder\nrow expansion\n\nI'll mark it as resolved after doing the docs tomorrow. Thank you for all the feedback on the initial version.. Ready for a test drive in upcoming 7.0.0-RC1.. We'll do it for beta.6.\n. It seems 2.1 is latest so we'll do 2.1.\n. Postpone to beta7.\n. Beta7 will be released on friday.\n. Thanks, we'll consider.\n. We'd like to avoid rewrite of all themes so decided to keep them as they are and keep using sass on premium themes only so idea is community themes use css and premium themes use scss.\n. I've found a way to let user define inline styles after latest changes so marking as wontfix;\nxml\n[style]=\"{width:'500px'}\"\ninstead of old way;\nxml\n[style]=\"width:500px\"\nThen we'll bind it to ngStyle internally.\n. I see but how can we unsort it, we don't hold a copy of original data ? :) The method is thought be companied with your call that updates the data.\n. Yes, the actual data is changed, we don't keep a copy and would rather not. I think this make a complex component much more complex and I cannot think of a good way to do it so leave it to user to provide new unsorted data as reset just cleans up the visuals like page-sort-filter.\n. How did we miss that? Thank you.\n. Yes, I'll update the wiki now.\n. I quickly came up with this, please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Building-From-Source\n. We'll do it tonight after releasing beta5 that brings compatibility with RCs\n. Schedule to tomorrow along with beta5 release.\n. I quickly came up with this, hope this helps;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Building-From-Source\n. Thanks\n. Can you replicate the same at;\nhttp://quilljs.com/\n. Cannot replicate. Thanks\n. You need to set overflow:visible in the column;\nhtml\n<p-column field=\"content\" header=\"Content\" style=\"{'overflow':'visible'}\">\n. Thank you.\n. You need to add fullcalendar to your page;\nhttp://fullcalendar.io/\nIf you have primeui-ng-all.min.js already, just add;\nxml\n<link rel='stylesheet' href='fullcalendar/fullcalendar.css' />\n<script src='lib/moment.min.js'></script>\n<script src='fullcalendar/fullcalendar.js'></script>\nOf course paths depend on your application.\n. You also need to map it, please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng-quickstart/blob/master/systemjs.config.js\n. I don't see this at;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/checkbox\n. I'll check with my colleagues. @mertsincan @Mrtcndkn @onursenture Can you guys test this in your environments, Mert uses windows so let's see.\n. Thank you, due to company policy we prefer to implement new components ourselves based on our development process so unable to accept the PR, however this feature is coming very soon. Here is the ticket;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1149\n. We've also fixed this before, thanks for the PR.\n. Thank you.\n. Can't replicate with RC4.\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/dropdown\nI can navigate with single tab.\n. Adding inputId;\n```xml\nCity\n\n```. Breadcrumb is reimplemented as a native component in beta6 and this is fixed as a result. There is a new menu model api so instead of generating markup yourself, the component will do it and update it according to changes.\nhtml\n<p-breadcrumb [model]=\"items\"></p-breadcrumb>\n``` typescript\nexport class BreadcrumbDemo implements OnInit {\nprivate items: MenuItem[];\n\nngOnInit() {\n    this.items = [];\n    this.items.push({label:'Categories'});\n    this.items.push({label:'Sports'});\n    this.items.push({label:'Football'});\n    this.items.push({label:'Countries'});\n    this.items.push({label:'Spain'});\n    this.items.push({label:'F.C. Barcelona'});\n    this.items.push({label:'Squad'});\n    this.items.push({label:'Lionel Messi', url: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi'});\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Sure, please. It would be a good pointer. We couldn't check the new router yet, we should to it for next week's beta6.\n. Hi, please use forum for discussions.  I think webpack is a common solution. As NG2 is new, I guess there are not many tutorials on deployment yet btw.\n. \nReady for 2.0, used such as;\nxml\n<p-dataTable [value]=\"cars\" [editable]=\"true\">\n    <p-column field=\"vin\" header=\"Vin\" [editable]=\"true\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"year\" header=\"Year\" [editable]=\"true\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"brand\" header=\"Brand\" [editable]=\"true\" [style]=\"{'overflow':'visible'}\">\n        <template let-col let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"editor\">\n            <p-dropdown [(ngModel)]=\"car[col.field]\" [options]=\"brands\" [autoWidth]=\"false\" [style]=\"{'width':'100%'}\" required=\"true\"></p-dropdown>\n        </template>\n    </p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"color\" header=\"Color\" [editable]=\"true\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"saleDate\" header=\"Sale Date\" [editable]=\"true\" [style]=\" {'overflow':'visible' }\">\n        <template let-col let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n             { {car[col.field]|date } }\n        </template>\n        <template let-col let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"editor\">\n            <p-calendar [(ngModel)]=\"car[col.field]\"></p-calendar>\n        </template>\n    </p-column>\n</p-dataTable>. Please create a new issue ticket for new cases to be reviewed.. Fixed for beta10.\n. You need to set overflow:visible in the column;\nhtml\n<p-column field=\"content\" header=\"Content\" style=\"{'overflow':'visible'}\">\n. @lilling Just added to docs\n. It depends on theme, what is your theme?\n. modal=\"false\" will still be modal, correct way is [modal]=\"false\", as this is confusing we keep booleans as modal=\"modal\" like html5 boolean attributes e.g disabled=\"disabled\". I've corrected the doc.\n. I couldn't get this working at all, I think we have another problem. [attr.data-value] does not work when we try to get the selected item from the li element. I'm thinking about alternatives.\n. Trying to find a way without adding new options as listbox works with objects.\n. appendTo body should fix this.. This is by design as it is in responsive mode by default. I can't replicate the off screen issue.. Let's track at 405 \n. Closing as tomorrow's beta9 even use the new new new router of RC3.\n. How did we miss this :( Thank you.\n. HTML is supported now\n. Available now. Better to create a named template for it. Please file a new issue with this request.. Fixed via 610.\n. Will merge the necessary part only in datatable.ts\n. 2.0.1 has VirtualScrolling for this.. We'll consider this when there are more requests, however I think if you import the module name instead of PrimeNG, you'll have a smaller bundle using the following convention;\ntypescript\nimport {ComponentModule} from 'primeng/components/componentname/componentname';\ntry;\ntypescript\nimport {AccordionModule} from 'primeng/components/accordion/accordion';\nConvention is: \ninstead of ;\ntypescript\nimport {AccordionModule} from 'primeng/primeng';\nSo your bundle will just have accordion instead of other PrimeNG modules.. @Pranen please create a new ticket for this request.\n@joe380 style and style class should solve this, new api is more flexible and more angular centric, old one was jquery centric. New model can handle change detection like removing or adding an item to menu, old one has various limitations.\n. Does it happen with 2.0.2?. I'm unable to replicate on 4.x, should be fine with 2.0.2 as well as nothing related has changed. Please provide a plunkr that replicates the issue and we'll review.. What does leistungen[index] = savedLeistung;? How can we replicate this issue?\n. Can't replicate.. This is already possible with a format like;\n<p-calendar [(ngModel)]=\"date1\" dateFormat=\"MM d, yy DD\"></p-calendar>\nMore info about pattern;\nhttps://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/\n. Thank you, this seems a bit more complicated than I expected so not merging it. We'll try to find a simpler solution and if not reopen. Please create a feature request at our tracker with your requirements.\n. We've done some improvements in beta7 regarding menus and I can't replicate this case with it, so marking as resolved.\n. Shouldn't you emit viewRender event instead of eventResize? Why do you emit this.onEventResize? Is it a typo?\n. I've replicated and added a fix that seems to prevent resort which is main cause of shuffle. \n. No, it should still sort when underlying data changes, but only once, with this bug it was sorting even on mouseover  :)\n. We've updated the editor and it seems to working with it. I've seen the issue with the beta6 editor, beta7 editor fixes this.\n. Tracking at 396.\n. With a separate group row or with Rowspan. Same idea of upcoming \n\n\n\nPrimeFaces row grouping.. Also added support for toggleable row groups as well as summary rows.\n\n. It should be fixed, please try with newer versions.. This should be fixed with newer releases, ngDoCheck reapplies filter if underlying data changes.. There is a limitation here, we can't know what you have inside the template. Feel free to suggest adding a new property like filterField to filter against in a new issue.. Fix checked in, thank you.\n. Why not just [class]=\"tableStyleClass\" ?\n. Thank you, we'll provide tableStyleClass but rather keep the responsive class as fixed for now.\n. See #1155\n. Please get beta8.\n. Does it happen with 2.0.2?. I think it is related to Angular, I'm not sure how we can improve it. Which part is slow? Rendering of data?\n. There is already yearRange.\n. I know, we're reviewing all issues now and updating them with current stage of codebase.\n. Fix checked in, thank you.\n. Can't replicate it, it works.\n. Should be better handled on app side by a custom interface that extends our TreeNode as mentioned above.\n. Column reordering has been reimplemented for beta7 and I can't replicate this with the new one.\n. Please use forum for such discussions;\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35\n. Does it still happen with 2.0.2?. What is your charts.js version? You need 2.1.x\n. Fixed the doc locally and it will be available tomorrow online, please report any documentation error at our issue tracker to let us know.\n. Issue is too common, you need to create per component requests.\n. You need to add jquery ui datepicker plugin, simple way is adding node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.js\n. Tracking at 396\n. Where do you write the css, try ViewEncapsulation.NONE in your component.\n. No issue on our side, this is related to style scoping, ViewEncapsulation to NONE will work.\n. Unable to replicate with 2.0.x.. What problem does it cause by not firing resize on load? Resize centers it, on load it centers itself already.\n. Works for me.. Please create separate tickets so we can handle each case one by one.. Try with 4.x please, it has collision detection improvements.. Fixes #525 \n. Please elaborate the use case.\n. There is now placeholder attribute in 2.0.2 for this.. Depends on how you implement column toggler, I'd suggest hiding the column instead of removing it from dom. \nxml\n<p-dataTable [value]=\"cars\" resizableColumns=\"true\">\n        <p-header>\n            <div style=\"text-align:left\">\n                <p-multiSelect [options]=\"columnOptions\" [(ngModel)]=\"cols\"></p-multiSelect>\n            </div>\n        </p-header>\n        <p-column *ngFor=\"let col of dtCols\" [field]=\"col.field\" [header]=\"col.header\" [hidden]=!isVisible(col)\"></p-column>\n    </p-dataTable>\n```typescript\nexport class DataTableColTogglerDemo implements OnInit {\ncars: Car[];\n\ncols: any[];\n\ndtCols: any[];\n\ncolumnOptions: SelectItem[];\n\nconstructor(private carService: CarService) { }\n\nngOnInit() {\n    this.carService.getCarsSmall().then(cars => this.cars = cars);\n\n    this.dtCols = [\n        {field: 'vin', header: 'Vin'},\n        {field: 'year', header: 'Year'},\n        {field: 'brand', header: 'Brand'},\n        {field: 'color', header: 'Color'}\n    ];\n\n    this.cols = this.dtCols.slice(0);\n\n    this.columnOptions = [];\n    for(let i = 0; i < this.cols.length; i++) {\n        this.columnOptions.push({label: this.cols[i].header, value: this.cols[i]});\n    }\n}\n\nisVisible(dtCol) {\n    for(let col of this.cols) {\n        if(col.field === dtCol.field) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n\n}\n```\nWhen I do this instead of the showcase example which just removes columns so loses width information, it works fine;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable/coltoggler. Currently no plans, if there is more demand, we'll reconsider, thank you for the feedback.. Try with a newer version please, it should work now.. Fixed via #972 \n. Thanks\n. PrimeNG will be released a month after Angular2 final. It still changes between RCs so we can't leave beta now. On our side, PrimeNG is stable, not big api changes planned, we'll just add new stuff.\n. I think we should just pass delta, oldDelta and source to the event without processing them.\n. We're unable to replicate.. Thanks for sharing.. Unable to replicate with newer versions.. Works for me on 51.. Unable to replicate with newer versions, please try with 2.0.2.. Can you provide a plunkr please?. Thanks, we'll do 4.0.RC1 on wednesday, I can ask my colleague to check this until then.. appendTo=\"body\" fixes this for me.. firstDay belongs to the locale config so better avoid duplicating it with a separate attribute. You can customize firstDay by binding an object that defines firstDay.\n. PR changes the new line character so I'll merge manually.\n. I can't replicate;\n{code}\n\n{code}\nmy-class ends up at the main div element of p-dropdown.\n. We'll review, thank you.\n. Tracking at #364 \n. Can you replicate at;\nhttp://beta.quilljs.com/\n. We've checked and this is already fixed if you use beta8 with quill beta release, we'll update the showcase soon as well.\n. Can you also add width to ContactName column as well.\n. Is this related to premium themes or also happens on other themes as well? \n. 1171 adds improvements to scrollable and I can't replicate this right now, please try with upcoming RC1 and drop a comment if you still experience it then we'll reopen.\n. This issue is a bit bloated with different cases, please create a new ticket if issue still persists with 4.0.2.. Not yet, will be by tuesday. If you can provide a plunkr right now, that would help so  we can review before release. But this was discussed many times, technically table-layout auto is not supported bh scrollable tables so we cant do much about it.. Thanks we'll review. May I ask how do you check for the memory usage in your case?\n. Thank you, we're investigating.\n. This might be fixed in upcoming beta.11, please confirm after beta.11 is released, if not we'll reopen. Rx based subscription for column changes are now cleared at onDestroy which is likely to be the reason.\n. Bootstrap has box-sizing: border-box for everything which is likely to break some of our components, so we can't add this css to our core as it will break cases where bootstrap is not included on page, so you have to keep it in your app as the workaround.\n. What is the purpose of the eye icon? Why hide them all?\n. Could you please provide screenshot on where the eye icon should be displayed.\n. We'll consider this and reply at jira.\n. We'd appreciate a PR for sure.\n. This is a feature request that is not implemented @mrtcndkn.. We've decided to do it however please create a ticket at your PRO jira to discuss details.. With beta9 around 29th June.\n. Updated to new router and new forms of RC2\n. Updated to new router and new forms of RC2\n. There are too many character changes, it is hard to find what has changed for review, please update the PR and we'll reopen.\n. Added new methods;\nprev(), next(), prevYear(), nextYear(), gotoDate(date), incrementDate(duration), getDate(), today()\n``` xml\n\n\n```\n``` typescript\nexport class MyModel {\nback(fc) {\n    fc.prev();\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Not sure, fieldValue is always the object itself which has everthing init. I'll reopen if more users request the same.\n. Like we have in PrimeFaces?\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/data/timeline.xhtml\n. Added to roadmap, will reopen once we pick it up;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap. We don't have any backend components and css part of PrimeNG uses PrimeUI, everything is under apache except the premium layouts and themes like rio, modena which are totally optional. Our business model is based on commercial support called PrimeNG PRO and the premium layouts and themes so no need to worry about license :)\n. I don't understand the requirement.. p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue. Please try the new p-table once 5.1.0 is released.. We'll wait for user feedback, last time we've removed the metaKey, many users demanded it back.\n. Not sure if the value added justifies the amount of changes, I don't see a problem of using expandedRows.\n. We'll try this for new TurboTable targeting 5.2.0-RC2. Moved to RC3 as we need to release RC2 asap.. Checkmate!\n\n. Scheduled for 4.1.1. Set to 4.1.4.. We've already done it, please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/492\n. Use ngModel instead of value attribute please. Also you need upcoming (tomorow) beta9 to use formControlName.\n. UI part is simple but do you mean global confirm functionality (p:confirm) as well, that sounds tricky a bit.\n. This is available for some time, so closing.. This attribute doesn't exist, have you seen it documented somewhere?\n. We'll check, thanks. Does it happen on IE11 or edge?\n. Sounds like breadcrumb but do you want it to be integrated to the router or sth?\n. Breadcrumb supports router with routerLink and routerLinkActive.. I see but you can already customize toolbar;\nxml\n<p-editor [(ngModel)]=\"text2\" [style]=\"{'height':'320px'}\">\n        <header>\n            <span class=\"ql-formats\">\n                <button class=\"ql-bold\"></button>\n                <button class=\"ql-italic\"></button>\n                <button class=\"ql-underline\"></button>\n            </span>\n        </header>\n    </p-editor>\n. Added onInit that passes the quill instance and also getQuill method.. Try setting autoWidth to false or giving a fixed width.\n. It works on any element, it binds to mouseover or mouseout, so does not care about target actually.. Yes it is planned before the end of year, we will do a similar solution as we did for PrimeFaces. We will also add drag drop support to tree, these 2 are the upcoming important features to Tree.\n. Any suggestions on generating pdf and excel at client side without hitting server?. Not PrimeNG related, closing.\n. I think this is obselete now after Dropdown reimpl.\n. Yes, fixed via PR above.. If the overlay mask div is moved into md-content from body, problem is resolved. Looks like this;\n\nDoes that solve your issue, if so we need to provide an option to make the element to attach the overlay mask customizable. Right now it is always body.\n. Please also check;\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=46238\n. Resolve, thanks.\n. I'd suggest using contentStyle property to customize the content section for your content like, giving overflow or giving height.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. Content is up to you, so you need to add necessary css like vertical-align to make adjustments. I don't think we should add some css as we can't know your content.\n. Tracked at #1087. Thanks, we'll reopen if more users demand it, we need more feedback.. Better way would be using a setter  I think to listen changes on first. I'll do this for beta 12.\n. Done but I'd suggest using activeIndex property instead.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. Can you replicate at live showcase?\n. This is fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. Why do you need selection mode without selecting binding?\n. Not sure, if more users demand it, we'll reconsider, please use it with a two-way binding.. Unable to replicate.. Fixed via #972 \n. Merged manually thank you.\n. Merged manually. Wrong issue number, reopen.. Does it still happen with new p-calendar which is native.. I've added \"ui-dropdown-open\" to the main outmost div container element. It is removed when dropdown is hidden.\n. We can add itemDisabled property to SelectItem interface.. Set to 6.0, although I personally think not displaying the option would be a better UX. However there is demand so we will do it for sure in 6.0.. It will be synced with Angular 6 which I believe will be before Ng-Conf, mid april.. SelectItem API gets disabled prop with 6.0.2 and now we're updating components such as ListBox that should utilize it;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6145\nEach component that supports it has its own ticket.. Sounds good to me. Thanks.\n. But show already does this so reverted for now.\n. Should be fixed with recent PrimeNG releases. please drop a comment if issue persists and we'll reopen.. Resolved the contextmenu position itself, will create a new issue for the subitem positioning.\n. Should be fixed with recent PrimeNG releases. please drop a comment if issue persists and we'll reopen.. Should be fixed with recent PrimeNG releases. please drop a comment if issue persists and we'll reopen.. Unable to replicate.. Calendar is a native components, does not use jquery, you need to use locale property instead.. So this is only to hide it when enter key is pressed?\n. I could not understand what the PR fixes, stopSortPropagation should not be ignored as it causes UI flicker and may constantly sort the even if you move mouse. That was added to fix it. Please create separate issues first each explaining the cause with a reproducible case and we'll review.\n. Via 1913. Glad to hear.. Had conflicts so merging manually\n. Duplicate of #403. We've decided to add binary attribute instead at #636 \n. There are conflicts so merging manually with slight changes. Thank you. Please see #649 649\n. Blur is fixed via;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2256. Fixed in 4.0.0-RC2.. This is expected as menu is absolute positioned against document but having a div with relative positioning makes it relative to this div not the body causing an offset.\nOne solution could be adding an option like appendToBody=\"true\", we'll try to see if this breaks anything inside the context of Angular2.\nCan you avoid position:relative by the way?\n. appendTo=\"body\" should do it.\n. Should be fixed with recent PrimeNG releases, can't remember the exact version. Please drop a comment if issue persists and we'll reopen.. Please try with latest PrimeNG, it should be fixed.. #1742 . Yes, styleClass=\"yourClass\" would help, you can do th.yourClass.. Yes, rowStyleClass.. Yes, exportFilename is for this.. We've paginatorPosition=\"top|bottom|both\" in PrimeFaces, @Mrtcndkn please try to implement this.\n. Thank you.\n. Shoud be fixed in recent releases, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen.. Please provide sample code that replicates it.\n. Maybe related to #651 ?\n. Shoud be fixed in recent releases, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen.. Merged with some changes.\n. Thank you.\n. It actually should be;\nxml\n<p-carousel [value]=\"items\">\n    <template let-item>\n        Content to display\n    </template>\n</p-carousel>\n. This is a bug of Angular2;\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8292\nCurrent workaround is moving expansion template before column templates, right after <p-datataTable tag.\nxml\n<p-dataTable\n   <template />\n   <p-column><template />\n. Fixed via #972 \n. Shoud be fixed in recent releases, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen.. Thank you, we'll reopen if more users demand it and make it customizable. Right now we need more feedback and make sure backward compatibility is not broken.. This is fixed in recent releases.. @Mrtcndkn , review please.\n. We're unable to replicate.\n. It should be resolved in recent releases, please try and drop a comment if issue persists, then we may reopen.. Fixed via #679. Try appendTo=\"body\" so it can be appended where you want it to be flexible. We've solved similar issues with overlays in PrimeFaces using this approach.\n. You need appendTo=\"body\" on overlay panel to solve this. It works for me. Provide a plunkr to request a reopen please.. The PR is merged so this issue should be fixed.. Working on it for 4.0.RC1.. Available for 4.0.RC1. DragDrop between multiple trees are also supported in addition to dragdrop within the same tree. They can choose if nodes can be draggable and/or droppable. So for example one tree can only give nodes whereas one can decided only to receive nodes. Also with draggableScope and droppableScope, a tree can decide whether to accept nodes from a certain tree.\n\n. You need to use PrimeNG 4 to get this feature, PrimeNG 2 only gets defect fixes, no new features as 4 does.. This is fixed in a similar way today. Thank you.\n. So you need to open a tab based on url? Can you provide more details?\n. Why not use tabMenu component?. I dont understand, we have created tabMenu to provide this feature so closing.. Why not? Please add a feature request ticket.. It was to avoid writing the model value back to model as setText or pasteHTML calls text-change, but removing it should not cost much. Will merge manually, thank you.\n. Please use forum for questions.. I don't think we pass global filter to LazyLoadEvent, we should.. 4.0.1 has positionTop and positionLeft for this.. Merged manually. Great example, closing as it is not Dialog related.. This is available in recent PrimeNG releases, can't remember the exact version but I'd suggest trying 4.0.x.. Duplicate of #783 \n. I'll keep # and do prevent default instead, thanks for the tip.\n. 2.0 fixes this, documented at the official announcement as well;\nhttp://blog.primefaces.org/?p=4341\nWe now use css pseudo so mouse movements do not trigger change detection.. Please use forum for questions, basically you can get do;\n<p-dataTable #dt\nThen after getting dt via ViewChild;\ndt.paginate({first: 20 /*calculate last here*/, rows: this.rows}). With beta12, it is defined like;\nhttp://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-yearRange\n.e.g\nxml\nyearRange=\"2002:2012\"\n. Planned for 4.2.. p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue. Please try the new p-table once 5.1.0 is released.. Thank you\n. I can't replicate with PrimeNG 4.0.1, please drop a comment if issue still persists.. A template can help here where you have full control over cell content including events.. I can't replicate with PrimeNG 4.0.1, please drop a comment if issue still persists.. Please use forum for how-to like questions.. Not able to replicate, please create a plunkr and we'll reopen if necessary.\nxml\n<p-dataTable [value]=\"cars\" expandableRows=\"true\">\n        <p-column expander=\"true\" styleClass=\"col-icon\"></p-column>\n        <p-column field=\"vin\" header=\"Vin\"></p-column>\n        <p-column field=\"year\" header=\"Year\"></p-column>\n        <p-column field=\"brand\" header=\"Brand\"></p-column>\n        <p-column field=\"color\" header=\"Color\"></p-column>\n        <ng-template let-car pTemplate=\"rowexpansion\">\n            <p-dataTable [value]=\"cars\">\n                <p-column field=\"vin\" header=\"Vin\"></p-column>\n                <p-column field=\"year\" header=\"Year\"></p-column>\n                <p-column field=\"brand\" header=\"Brand\"></p-column>\n            </p-dataTable>\n        </ng-template>\n    </p-dataTable>\n\n. Please use forum for cases like these. Templates like Ultima-Posedion are based on CLI and they have TreeTable working, better to discuss at forum.. Seems like related to old calendar, can't replicate it 4.0.1. Feel free to drop a comment if issue still persists.. Created NG-Modules for PrimeNG components, updated our showcase app.\n. 1262 changes dialog width to auto, will this help this case where you can now add custom breakpoints;\n@media screen and (max-width: 40em) {\n    .ui-dialog.ui-dialog-responsive {\n        width: 90% !important;\n    }\n}\n. #739 should fix it. Please track there.\n. Whoops, wrong commit.\n. Obselete now as this is related to old components.. Links work for me.\n. Please check with beta13 monday which officially supports RC5.\n. Glad to hear.\n. Menu components require a Router.. Shoud be fixed in recent releases, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen.. Please use forum for such cases. It would be useful to post the code there as well. Thank you.\n. Thanks but I'm not sure about string comparison, we have some object equality check method that I'll try.\n. We've done it for PrimeFaces and can do the same as well;\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/input/triStateCheckbox.xhtml\n. Please use forum for cases like these, thank you.. Thank you.\n. Added with your PR, thanks.\n. Duplicate of #784.\nDo you experience same at live showcase?\n. Not sure how we can get the old value so there is a technical limitation to think about, if more users demand it, we'll reopen, thank you for the feedback.. Have you imported Paginator Module?\n. We not export PaginatorModule, FormsModule in DataTableModule so when you use DataTableModule, PaginatorModule will be available already meaning you don't need to import it manually anymore with beta14.\n. Try modules instead;\nimport { CalendarModule, DataTableModule, InputMaskModule } from 'primeng/primeng';\nDataTable exports column and paginator so no need to import them.\n. Kinda duplicate to #771 \n. Please use forum for cases like these.. Reviewed this and decided to keep it as it is, there are to ways to use this anyway;\n1) Options property where you can use eventDataTransform as schedule provides a way to define any fullCalendar property using the options property.\n2) Schedule is a wrapper anyway, you can do the transform at your angular component and then pass it to the schedule.. Set target to beta15.\n. Just reviewed, one question what is the reason for following methods;\n- expandToNode\n- findPathToNode\n- findPathToNodeRecursive\n. Thank you, I'd appreciate if you resolve the conflicts and I'll commit. Please note that we plan to release beta16 tomorrow with NG2 final update.\n. Thank you for your contribution.\n. This is really weird, we don't use hammer.js at all. Do you have it in your app?\n. Closing as can't replicate. Please provide a plunkr if issue persists.. Shoud be fixed in recent releases, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen. Note that we are not using jQuery for a long time for calendar so issue seems obselete.. We'll add this to upcoming spreadsheet component.. Please use forum for how-to like cases and questions with detailed requirements. Demo link from ag-grid can help as well. Filtering templates can help this case as well.. This is Angular2 related so had to close. We will do PrimeNG RC1 after NG2 goes final.\n. If the item has no children, yes. otherwise it is not possible right now. If more users demand it, we'll reopen for sure.. Unable to replicate with 4.0.1, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen.. Sorry for the delay, we are on different things at the moment regarding PrimeNG.\n@darkwarriorn4p For routerLink issue, please create a new ticket, that should work. #954 should help as well if we fix it.\nAbout MenuModel, to begin with, what would be the alternative? Something like following;\n<p:menu>\n  <p:submenu>\n    <p:menuitem>\n  </p:submenu>\n</p:menu>\n- Nested json and \n  I agree it doesn't look on big menus but it would be the same story with declarative elements as well like p-menuitems everywhere.\n- Menus not visible in HTML-Template\n  I don't think this is a big issue.\n- Command binding\n  What could be the alternative?\n- Context-Sensitive Functions\n  What do you  mean by the index loop? The index of the splitButtonItem?\n- Code generation for dynamic Menus becomes necessary\n  Isn't this required only once so that you can reuse?\n- No custom Templates\n  Yes, menus are pretty much static in terms of templating.\n. We're so much in to the MenuModel API now, in PrimeNG components and the premium templates, better to stick with it.. PrimeFaces uses the approach you've described, at PrimeNG we've changed it to be more mobile friendly as there are no shift or metakeys, but we are open to suggestions such as customizable behavior with an attribute to choose between behaviors although it'll make it complex.\n. I think we can introduce an attribute to configure this behavior for sure in 1.0 final due end of october.\n. We've decided to enable key based multiple selection by default and on touch enabled devices, switch to tap based multiple selection targeting RC4. So it depends on environment.\n. We left the shift for post 1.0 but the behavior is implemented now, tap for mobile and metakey-ctrlkey for others.\n. In our near future roadmap.. slotChart is for mask placeholder and placeholder attribute itself is used as the html5 input placeholder.\n. Migration is simple as changing below;\nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"node_modules/primeui/themes/omega/theme.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"YOUR_PATH/font-awesome.min.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.css\" />\nto;\nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/omega/theme.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"YOUR_PATH/font-awesome.min.css\" />\n. Please provide a plunkr, issue is not clear on our side.. Thank you.\n. https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/treetable. Shoud be fixed in recent releases, please drop a comment if issue still persists and we may reopen.. inputStyle and inputStyleClass can help;\n<p-calendar [inputStyle]=\"{'width':'100px'\"} .... Please provide a plunkr that replicates the issue and we may reopen. I can't replicate with 4.0.1. Yes, we should add collision detection.. Reopening for code review.. Complete rewrite.. Please use forum for \"how-to\" like cases.. Please provide a plunkr to helps us replicate, this issue is a duplicate was fixed in earlier versions. Please create a new ticket once you have the plunkr.. Not sure how to implement it, upcoming filterFunction could be a solution as we can't know what is inside column so need to ask the page author to see if filter value applies the data/content displayed.. p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue. Please try the new p-table once 5.1.0 is released.. Please use forum for \"how-to\" cases like these, thank you.. Thanks\n. I guess you can use afterViewInit or afterViewChecked at your own component that uses the datatable.. It could be possible, why do you need the id for?\n. Please create a separate topic like \"id attribute for datatable\" so we can track and implement these requests one by one.. That is required for menu components to support routerLink functionality so that clicking on an item navigates to a view defined by the router, we are open to suggestions though. Not sure about dummy router.\n. Menu components require a router, not aware of a may to make it optional I'm afraid.. Assigned to beta.17 so we won't forget it this time.\n. beta15 is due early next week, we'll start the update today and I'll have more information about share. From the changelog I read, we shouldn't have too much troubles.\n. All seems to be fine now after today's changes.\n. Turns out we have already done it :)\n. New docs should clear this up. We were going to do this for beta15 but then RC6 happened, so planned for beta16 for sure. It is time for us to start accessibility enhancements focusing on, aria roles-attributes, screen readers and keyboard support.\n. Issue is not clear.. Doing this at constructor fails though with undefined at this.tabPanels, so using afterContentInit as doc suggests.\n. But we can't know what is inside templates so there is a technical limitation, will reopen if we can find a way.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen. . This is planned for 4.1.1. Set to 4.1.4.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. Done, thank you.\n. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. We haven't managed to spare time to look into this yet, we'd appreciate feedback on how to add AOT compatibility.\n. Thanks we'll review after beta17.\n. AOT support work has started and we definitely need feedback. As far as I understand metadata files are only required for non-ts files, from the docs;\n\nThe \"skipMetadataEmit\" : true property prevents the compiler from generating metadata files with the compiled application. Metadata files are not necessary when targeting TypeScript files, so there is no reason to include them.\n\n@ammar91's PR adds metadata files which we'd like to avoid maintaining, my initial idea is make sure sure ngc properly compiles our ts files and also ship the ts files in the npm package because until now we only ship js. When the ts files of PrimeNG will be in npm and as a result in your app's node_modules, I'm hoping you will be able to compile your app with AOT without need for metadata files. Of course, we'll make sure ngc compiles our ts without issues before releasing.\nFeedback is welcome.\n. My current decision is not to include ts and generate metadata.json files when publishing. I'd appreciate if you could point me to the process of generating these files.\n. Thanks, I'll work on this soon.\n. Work has started, I'm doing an entire code review to remove \"any\" types and check aot compatibility. As a side note, I had to add \"skipMetadataEmit\" : false to get the metadata json files also somehow haven't done some steps like number 5 but it worked fine.\n. Quick question, does setting \"noImplicitAny\" in tsconfig-aot.json as false have any impact on AOT metadata json files or ngFactory? Right now there are aot compilation issues due to usage of protected-private variables in inline templates of components as expected, my main focus is on that to get AOT ready instead of replacing \"any\" with actual type which can be done with a refactor later.\n. Alright, I've done the changes for AOT support.\n. Thank you\n. This is available already since 6.1.4. First and Rows properties should allow access already.. Also requested by a PRO user today so will do for beta17.\n. Duplicate of #756 \n. What is your version?\n. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. You can also use showOverlay() method.. Attributes-Properties same actually for PrimeNG, they are all @Input() for the component. We've just renamed them all to Properties though.. By default label of a treenode is displayed inside a tree node, in case you need to place custom content define a pTemplate that gets the treenode as an implicit variable. Example below places an input field to create editable treenodes.\nxml\n<p-tree [value]=\"files\">\n    <template let-node  pTemplate type=\"default\">\n        <input [(ngModel)]=\"node.label\" type=\"text\" style=\"width:100%\">\n    </template>\n</p-tree>\nMultiple templates are supported by matching the type property of the TreeNode with the type of pTemplate\nxml\n<p-tree [value]=\"files\">\n    <template let-node  pTemplate type=\"picture\">\n        <img [attrs.src]=\"picture.path\">\n    </template>\n    <template let-node  pTemplate type=\"default\">\n        <input [(ngModel)]=\"node.label\" type=\"text\" style=\"width:100%\">\n    </template>\n</p-tree>\n. A PrimeNG PRO customer were using the ngIf approach but they requested multiple template as it gets complex when you have more node types, multiple templates are cleaner and easier to maintain, instead of multiple *ngIfs.\n. Can't replicate.\n. Done and being tested.\n. ``` xml\n\n<p-dropdown #dd [options]=\"cars\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCar\" [style]=\"{'width':'150px'}\" editable=\"editable\"></p-dropdown>\n\n```\n. We'll do customizable filter elements so you'll add whatever component instead of predefined elements.\n. Agreed, we had separators in PrimeFaces, why not for PrimeNG as well.\n. Planned for 4.0.1.. Will do it for 4.0.3.. Obselete now as calendar is rewritten.\n. Do you use css from primeui or primeng? You need to use;\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css\" />\n. What is the use case for it?\n. We've added showUploadButton and showCancelButton, to do client side only, you need to set these two attributes to false and then use (onSelect) callback to implement client side only logic, so it would be just a nice rich file selector without upload.\n@mike-nyllabs, your case is #3040. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. There is a conflict, please resolve the conflicts.\n. You need to place them inside ui-g-*, if you add ui-fluid to outmost ui-g then listbox will be 100% so will work well within grids.. Unable to replicate with RC4.\n. p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue. Please try the new p-table once 5.1.0 is released.. Interesting idea, we'll consider this.\n. We've decided to keep it as it is and will reconsider if more users demand it.\n. But beta15 has no dependencies or peerDependencies in the npm package. \n. Currently menu components depend on Router but we'll consider breaking that dependency in a future version. Overall we've tested upcoming beta16 with NG 2.0 and have no issues.\n. In our near future plans.. Available for 4.1.RC1.\n\n. I guess you still use old resources from PrimeUI, you need to include css from PrimeNG instead as we don't use PrimeUI anymore in PrimeNG.\nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/omega/theme.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css\" />\n.

Thanks.\n. Done for 4.0.3. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. This was fixed before, thank you.\n. We've decided to keep it as it is and will reconsider if more users demand it.\n. Like we had in PrimeFaces;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/file/upload/basic.xhtml. Duplicate of #504 . Can't replicate so please provide a plunkr that replicates the issue.. This is discussed a couple of times, datatable has 100% width so even you give 100px browser will scale it, it works best if you give percentages. Also please try with latest version as there are various improvements.. There is a conflict and issue with new line character, we'll do this for 1.0 final. Thank you.\n. Mask is reimplemented as a native component instead of jquery, so will check this for beta17.\n. We've fixed this today, thanks for the PR. Also PR misses the styles for alignment.\n. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. Hi, please use forum for how-to like questions and support requests.. Thanks for the PRO but changes are a bit too much, significant new features should be developed by our team following our processes as a company policy. We'll add this feature in near future though.\n. We'll review, we have scrollInView property that we can call on open to fix this.. Even routerLink directives requires Router to be configured as a module in app so could not find a way to decouple.\n. Please provide a plunkr as we couldn't replicate yet.. That is strange, what is your Angular 2 version?\n. This should also happen when you add an input or button or anchor inside table header. We need to find a way to stop sorting in these cases.\n. Please provide your sample html code regarding datatable.\n. You need to include jquery, jquery ui until we reimplement it as a native component. Easiest way is;\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.min.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-ui-timepicker-addon/1.6.1/jquery-ui-timepicker-addon.min.js\"></script>\n. I couldn't replicate on 2.0.1, can you please post your p-dataTable code.\n. Fixed via #1396. Please use forum for cases like these. For 4.0.3, we've added dependencies as devDependencies by the way so no need to add the deps anymore and updated wiki according to @JakeSummers \nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Building-From-Source. Today I've converted the codebase as an Angular CLI project;\nhttps://github.com/cagataycivici/primeng/\nWill move to master tomorrow and update the wiki according to this big change.. We have pTemplate to identify templates, I'll use it instead. Thank you.\n. We'll add collapsed property so you can bind to it also add a public method.. Just realized we have a property already named active;\n```xml\n\n\n            Click to Edit\n        \n\n\n\n\n<button (click)=\"active=!active\">Toggle</button>\n\n```. I'm not sure, technically row is clicked due to propagation right? What if another user wants it to be fired?\n. I think we do not select row (onRowSelect) in such a case when selection mode is on, it makes sense to do it for onRowClick callback as well.\nDo you use p:checkbox?\n. I've applied the similar solution we had in PrimeFaces.\n. Could you please create a new issue and post the number here, we can check it for 4-RC2.. Duplicate for 395, for button labels, please create another ticket.\n. Duplicate of 885.\n. Dup of #1065 \n. Makes sense for sure, for deep equals there is dataKey to speed it up btw.. Added compareSelectionBy=\"equals | deepEquals\".  Made it a string as I have a plan to introduce a 3rd faster option.. If there is no dataKey, then equals (identity) or deepEquals (equality). . @Mrtcndkn Please take over.. Revert as it is broken, will do it for 4.1.x.. What is your PrimeNG version?\n. Duplicate of #1193\n. Reverting due to #1170 \n. No plans to do it as we offer layouts as a premium option such as Ultima.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen. Make sure you use the template type with pTemplate.. Thank you\n. Don't you need to bind it to input and buttons, also disable functionality when readonly is on?\n. It seems we've removed readonly binding so PR is invalid, I'll add it.\n. Fixed today via https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/afa673bc3d71225d683cda42c869b9bcceecd61c\n. We'll add AOT support in 1.0.0-RC1 (end of october)\n. I don't think metadata.json files should be under version control, shouldn't we generate them before publishing the npm package instead?\n. Let's discuss at 871\n. Resize and Reorder are not supported for Scrollable table but we'll work on it for 1.0 final.\n. This is delayed after 1.0 final which is due next week. We only do bug fixes now until then. Our expectation is at most end of november for this functionality. If you consider PrimeNG PRO support service that will speed up the process, if not end of november is the plan on our side.\n. A custom validator seems to be necessary for MultiSelect.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with them and if issue persists drop a comment and we'll reopen.. [tableStyle]=\"{'table-layout':'auto'}\"\nor via style class;\n.ui-datatable table {\n    table-layout: auto\n}\nNote that auto layout is not supported for resize or scrollable tables.. We can't replicate it with RC4, please try with the latest version.\n. This should be fixed with new calendar.\n. Dup of #534 . Newer versions have metaKeySelection property to bring this behavior.. Please use forum for support requests.. This combination is not supported, better use a radio-checkbox because both bind to click event causing the conflict. Selection with a separate column like radio-checkbox-button will be the better solution. Even if we support it, I see a UX issue down the road.. So you want to use dd.mm.yy for dateFormat when displaying and need an alternative format? Does 1230 and 1231 help your case as well? Can you give us a detailed example with dateFormat, internalFormat and so on.\n. Thanks, closing for now, please drop a comment if necessary after RC4 (tomorrow)\n. You can use rowStyleClass so closing now.. Unable to replicate without a plunkr. Please provide a plunkr if issue happens again.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/VZbdZfQ7SuTV87tTkbYR. Duplicate of #860 \n. Fixed with a slightly different approach, also can't accept the PR due the differences in space/tab.\n. Are your nodes all expanded by default?\n. Please use forum for support requests.. This is on roadmap;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\nClosing for now and will create a new ticket with details when we pick it up from roadmap after 1.0. \nAt the moment, we're closing tickets that duplicate the upcoming features in roadmap as a part of issue tracker maintenance.\n. This is a question, please use forum for questions. \nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35\n. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with it and if the issue persists drop a comment with along with a test case based on plunkr below and we'll review again.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/VZbdZfQ7SuTV87tTkbYR. Should be fixed on ng2-responsive side, PrimeNG Table has its own responsive mode. We can't support all 3rd party ng* modules out there.. This is expected since autocomplete is not a simple input component and tooltip attaches events to host, p-autoComplete event has no focus/blur, we'll review to see how this is possible.. Duplicate of #713 . Don't understand, JSON is first-class citizen for PrimeNG, all demos use it as well.. Using first property should enable this. For example if you set it to 0, datatable should page to first page. Please drop a comment if that doesn't work for you and we may reopen.. Please send an email to contact at primetek.com.tr.\n. This feature will be added in near future after 1.0.\n. RowGrouping is available for some time.. Please use forum for support requests.. Weird, resizing only works well to me it is fixed layout. Also layout:auto will break scrollable tables.. No plans for table-layout:auto in scrollable tables due to technical reasons. Regarding the issue you can use style or styleClass option of column to specify width or tableStyle to set table-layout:auto if you are not using resize and/or scroll. Table-layout:auto will work fine except these two cases.\n<p-dataTable [tableStyle]=\"{'table-layout':'auto'}\"\nGives auto fit..

Note that this is not added to all d.ts files but the ones where we use something like Function, Event, MouseEvent or similar that causes a reference to core-js. \nAs a quick workaround, add no resolve when compiling.\ntsc --noResolve\n. @cacogr , good coincidence, we were trying the same thing and it worked, the generated d.ts files do not have the core-js reference anymore. We're checking and will do RC2 as this turned out to be a common issue.\n. Try with 1.0.0.RC2 please.\n. Awesome, thanks for the feedback guys.\n. Looks like we're having an RC (release crisis). Please try with RC3, RC2 fixes the core-js issue but published the modules as es2015, which should be commonjs. Hopefully RC3 brings back the order.\n. We've decided to give colors to Ultima Growl as well in next version.. Try with upcoming RC2 please, it will fix it. Related to #1186 \n.

I suspect this may fail if first day of week is sunday or monday, wdyt? I'll add it with some changes.. See;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2361. Will review for next version.. Can't replicate with 4.0.2.. We'Ve added dev-server but no need for PrimeNG itself to depend on Angular 2 as it is a peer dependency. If we add them as dependency then there duplicate Angular 2 dependencies will be at node_modules/primeng/node_modules afaik.\nPlease see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Building-From-Source\n. I'd suggest using templating with item template and selected item template with 2.0.1 so you have full control of content.. Works as expected.\n.

This is not related to PrimeNG, it seems to be related to Angular 2 itself better to ask this at Angular 2 side. Note that we use @ContentChildren to get columns, it seems ng-content projection does not provide those. You may trying getting the children yourself with @ContentChildren and passing it to the datatable programmatically e.g. datatable.columns = //columns that you get from ContentChildren.\n. @Mrtcndkn, please take over, this is a nice addon.\n.

Not sure about this, readonlyInput is derived from PrimeFaces actually, it is used to set the input as readonly and only allow selecting date with the overlay without input. readonly also should not show the overlay maybe, again I'm not sure, we need more feedback on this so not taking an action at the moment.. This has been discussed before, this is by design, on non-touch devices use metakey+ctrlkey and on touch devices use click/tap, for previous discussions;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/794\nThe metakey/ctrlkey implementation is based on operating system such mac or windows which users are familiar with. On mobile devices, datatable switches to tap based selection without keys as they don't exist. We'll keep monitoring further feedback, we might introduce attributes to make this customizable in future right now we could not replicate a bug.\n. Discussed at 1260.\n.

Duplicate of #1005 \n. The idea is good but we haven't received any negative feedback until now regarding SelectItem api, we prefer to have this API to represent the option tag and to follow a certain interface. We'll reconsider if we receive more feedback in future. Also if we do something like this, it should also do the same for all input component that use SelectItem API.\n. I see your point but we need an interface to represent option and optgroup elements, for example to disabled an item in the list and also to group them with optgroup.\n. It would be better if you wrap in at app side rather than we do it. But again, if we get more feedback, that is fine to do the change.\n. Tracking at #1295 \n. This is likely to cause an infinite loop, see;\n1170\nPlease try this with a lazy loading datatable first.\n. Thanks, no need for a new PR, we'll do it at 1295\n. You haven't seem to imported DataTableModule.\n. Great, thanks!. Do you need window scroll position to scroll to the selected item? Please provide more details.. p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue. Please try the new p-table once 5.1.0 is released.. Thank you, we'll do this ourselves for RC5 at;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1295\n. What problem does this solve?\n. What is the case where you have to compare different select item instances.\n. I see but we need more details, we should not add it just because other libs have it. When you load the options, you bind them to the multi select. When you load them again to change them, same instances are bound as well. Can you post some code where you need compareField? It is not clear.\n. This PR has too many unrelated commits, please create a issue ticket so we can discuss first.. Thank you, will update.\n. This is on our todo list.. This is expected, one may prefer to keep selections if they exist in new data set as well. So it should better be handled at app side not by datatable. Also we can't really know how the data changes, maybe a certain record is removed or added due to crud logic, if we remove selections in that case that would cause bugs, however on app side you know the type of data change (e.g. new search results or change a record in existing dataset), better you decide how to handle selections.\n. Thank you but timeout is not the best solution, we'll do this at 1287 with binding.\n. Thank you.\n. filteredByUser flag fixes that, it prevents filtering again at ngDoCheck\n. Added rowStyleClass which is a function that gets the row data and returns the style class.\n<p-dataTable [rowStyleClass]=\"customize\"\ncustomize(rowData, rowIndex): string {\n    //return style class\n}\n.

We'll do this via upcoming inputnumber for this instead.. There is inputId for all inputs in recently PrimeNG releases that you can use to match with label.. Please use forum for questions;\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35\nYou can use AOT and lazy loading routes to speed it up.\n. Do you know the steps to make PrimeNG support universal?. First we need to identify the componens that directly access browser objects like window on initialization I believe. Angulars renderer api (I think it has a new name in Angular 2) provides an abstraction so although we use it in many other parts, the parts that directly use window or similar should be replaced. So please create separate issues as this issue is too broad, a new issue can be, \"Growl support for Angular Universal\", then we'll do our best to provide support.\nI don't think we can do anything for some components like charts and schedule though, but 90%+ can be universal friendly.. @itsmeprasanjit, primereact is an idea but it is not a top level project at PrimeTek right now, so our resources are dedicated to PrimeNG and PrimeFaces at the moment. We need to expand our team so a new members on our team will work on PrimeReact.. Cool, we will also start enhancements by mid april.. This is closed because we need to handle each case one by one such as \"Growl doesn't support Universal\" or \"Universal support for Dropdown\". I believe many already support it and we can tweak others that do not support it, feel free to point us to the created issues. Next week, we'll start issue tracker cleanup as well and add universal label to issues for better tracking.. Provide a plunkr please.. I can't replicate it, I'm not sure if it is clear that in lazy mode, the loading should be done by your backend, DataTable does not do page-sort-filter in lazy mode, it just sends metadata in LazyLoadEvent so that you can do a backend call to load the lazy data everytime filter-sort-page happens.. Thank you. Doesn't your app have a router?\n. Currently router is required by the menu components I'm afraid, we couldn't find an easier way not depend on it. Feedback is welcome..

This is on roadmap;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap\nClosing for now and will create a new ticket with details when we pick it up from roadmap after 1.0. \nAt the moment, we're closing tickets that duplicate the upcoming features in roadmap as a part of issue tracker maintenance.\n. #1742 . By convention, native html attributes are lowercase, PrimeNG related attributes are camel case for all (because of our java background).. @jdpearce, I'd be glad to use ngClass in this case but rowData is not available to the page author as it is created when we loop the data to create TRs with ngFor. The scope of rowData variable is not exposed to your outer component that uses p-dataTable. So although I'm not 100% happy with current impl, it is the only working solution we've found. We're open to other suggestions though, not sure how can do it event based, Angular does not provide an event that we can expose when TR elements are created.. p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue. Please try the new p-table once 5.1.0 is released.. Duplicate of #1182?.

This PR breaks existing functionality, so even without making the parent scrollable or changing the height, showing after scrolling the page breaks it. We need alternatives to handle these cases such as supplying the overflown container to the tooltip so we can do math based on it, for example setting the container as position relative so tooltip will be absolute relative to its scrolling ancestor..

For example;\n<p-tabMenu [model]=\"items\" [activeItem]=\"items[1]\"></p-tabMenu>\nThis will open the index 1 by default, if you bind a variable instead then you can change it programmatically like;\n<p-tabMenu [model]=\"items\" [activeItem]=\"currentItem\"></p-tabMenu>\nchange() {\n    currentItem = this.items[1];\n}. Reopening for code review.. Thank you.. There are conflicts, please resolve them and provide description on what the fix does.. Sounds good, we'll consider this.. Will do for 4.1.1. Planned for 6.1.3 so very soon. Highlight of 6.1.3 will be the OverlayPanel enhancements.. Implemented for 7.0.0-RC1. For such cases with significant changes, our policy is to implement the features by ourselves following our own processes. Due to this reason, I'm afraid I can't accept it however we've plans to do it in 2.0.. onFilter event gives it as event.filteredValue..

This increases performance as it avoids traversing all properties of two compared objects and also supports immutable objects. For example, it should even work if you run Object.freeze() on all rows.. Sure, will do.. Please create another issue for this.. Glad to hear.. Fixed via #1539.

Is your ViewEncapsulation = NONE if you are using styles or stylesURL of @component. If not, try with ViewEncapsulation.None as Angular adds scoping that may cause this. It is not really PrimeNG related if so.\nWhat is your custom CSS?. It does not matter, it is a boolean attribute like disabled such as disabled=\"disabled\". modal=\"false\" won't disabled it due to Angular syntax unless it is [modal]=\"false\"..

There is inputId property for that.. What is the purpose of manipulating body?. I see, instead we should make this easier by introducing a property like disableScroll=\"true|false\".. #1968 should fix this, I've added documentation as well.\nScrolling Containers\nWhen placed inside a scrolling container like an overflown div such as scrollable datatable cells, tooltip must be appended to another element that has relative positioning instead of document body which is the default.\n<div pTooltip=\"Enter your username\" appendTo=\"target\" style=\"position:relative\">. You may use onEdit to get notified while cell is being edited and onEditComplete when editing is completed with enter key..

Any feedback is welcome, I am +1 on replacing it. . p-dataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue.

This is expected as browser does not fire the events that triggers the tooltip if the target is disabled.

You can just remove white-space:nowrap from the column via style or styleClass property.. Duplicate of #2900. Will be ready in 4.1.1. There are other problems with scrollable containers and tooltip like misalignment after scrolling. For example, first shod the tooltip and then scroll resulting it disconnection of tooltip and target. We've added an initial workaround and documented it for tomorrow's RC3 release which is a good starting point.. From docs;\nWhen placed inside a scrolling container like an overflown div, tooltip must be appended to another element that has relative positioning instead of document body which is the default.\n<div #container style=\"inline-block;position:relative\">\n    <input type=\"text\" pInputText pTooltip=\"Enter your username\" placeholder=\"Right\" [appendTo]=\"container\">\n</div>. If the appendto is another angular component, then this will break probably as this.appendTo.scrolltop is undefined so NAN may be set to target top.. #1974 fixes this.. @Mrtcndkn Please provide an example here..

There is onRowClick, you can get the event.target, find the td element and get the index which is way too hard, I think we should pass the column to the onRowClick, much easier..

I'd suggest templating instead for customization. We'll consider input pipe if there is demand in the future.. We also need to support vw vh and any other units.. width, height, minWidth and minHeight are deprecated, suggested way is using the style prop with the unit you prefer;\n<p-dialog [style]=\"{width: '50vw'}\". Tooltip requires a host, tr is not a host, you need a custom impl for this on your side. The request is too custom for us to implement.. Please create separate feature request tickets so we can review them separately instead of one grouping ticket.. Please file at;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/ultima-ng/issues.

It is a huge task and if there is more demand, we can do it. Due to personal preferences they are inline.. It was done this way to avoid an expression was changed ... error of Angular, will review again.. I can't replicate, please try with 4.0.RC2 when it is released and provide a plunkr. get filled(): binding was causing expression was changed error of angular before so we had to avoid it. \nIf issues persist, we'll reopen.. This is handled by fullcalendar, it always ignores provided end date and sets it as null internally. I think if times are included then it will display fine.. As far as I know this is by design of fullcalendar;\nhttps://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/2653. More information at endDate section;\nhttps://fullcalendar.io/docs1/event_data/Event_Object/. This is a bug of showcase demo not the schedule itself, each newly created event must have a unique id.. Yes, you need to make sure every event has unique id. This is required by fullcalendar.. Although I like the points, we cannot do the change due to backward compatibility.. But trackBy causes a problem, leaving it empty breaks the table and data does not change.. Thanks we will review.. Same as ngForTrackBy, consult the docs of Angular please.. Provide a plunkr please.. Thanks we will review for 4.0.3.. It is better to divide each case of DataTable into separate tickets for example, we've added a performance boost for selection in;\n3101\nOther one is;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/3102\nWe're trying the best we can do from our side, however for 1K+ rows the number of bindings increase so we may hit a wall. I'd suggest pagination if that is acceptable. In the end, lazy or non-lazy, pagination can deal with large datasets or virtual scroll.\nClosing as we're adding different tickets for each improvement.. That example does not really render 1000+ rows, it is similar to the VirtualScroll mode of DataTable which again same as pagination. I'd like to see what happens when you push 1000 rows to the dom.. We're still digging this, it seems number of columns has a huge factor, I've tried code of @cyberrranger with 2000 rows on 3 columns and result is quite acceptable. Increasing columns significantly slows down it,  I've then removed all the column content like editable cells or so and just kept simple readonly content to display the column field value which resulted in 2000K rows with 9 columns perfoming really well, no delays on mouse interactions. I think we've found our bottleneck.. Please provide a plunkr that simulates your case and we'll review.. Merged, thank you. Performance gain is significant!.

Fixed via;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2098. Demo router is one level, to implement something like this you need to configure child routers to do something like components/forms. Current behavior is expected. But we'll see if we can do this as an example in next version of Ultima.. This seems to be expected as Schedule gets the event array from the angular component and creates a separate internal array of its own with new properties that wrap the event object you've provided. Dragging and Resizing change the start and end dates of this internal event object, not the wrapped object you've provided. Also a callback is provided for you to do changes to the actual event object in events array. If you think, p-schedule component should update the events array which sounds like the angular way, following fixes the issue which gets the actual event and updates start and end dates.\nWhat do you think?\n```\neventDrop: (event, delta, revertFunc, jsEvent, ui, view) => {\n                let sourceEvent = this.findEvent(event.id);\n                if(sourceEvent) {\n                    sourceEvent.start = event.start.format();\n                    sourceEvent.end = event.end.format();\n                }\n            this.onEventDrop.emit({\n                'event': event,\n                'delta': delta,\n                'revertFunc': revertFunc,\n                'jsEvent': jsEvent,\n                'view': view\n            });\n        },\n\n```. 2.0.2 yes..

Better name could be indicator.. You should use style classes as your custom style breaks responsiveness, better way is creating style classes to define widths and using media queries optimize them for mobile screen, there is nothing to do on our side. You need to write media queries to solve this.. We'll introduce these after 4.1, more are on the way as well.. This is available since 6.0.2;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-6-0-2-released/.

Ok reopening then to be reviewed. Thanks.. In single mode, there is an input so can't think of a way to use the selectedItemTemplate  and the input at the same time so that's why it was closed I guess. Not sure how we can offer templating for the value prop of the input field.. We will create an accessibility matrix wiki with estimates this week to document/ track the accessibility state of each component, then will pick things up from there to improve. As multiselect is a popular component, my rough guess is end of april latest.. Not yet, we're doing an issue tracker review this week and will do the matrix later.. Planned for 4.1.1. Merged in, thanks. You can also use;\nhourFormat=\"12\"\nTo support both, your PR helps for sure..

Duplicado! :). There is maxSelectedLabels property for this.. Fixed via PR, thanks @upmauro @ova2 . Reverting due to regressions;\ne.g. 2426. Should we introduce activeIndex property? We have it in PrimeFaces, I think with a setter we can hook-in to changes to activeIndex and manage the selected property of the selected tab.. Thanks, can be used by binding a number to the activeIndex property. In example below, buttons can be used to change the active tab.\n```xml\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\n<p:tabView [activeIndex]=\"index\" ...\n```\n```typescript\n   public index: number;\nchange(index: number): void {\n          this.index = index;\n   }\n```. It depends on the location, we usually pass the index. Please create a new ticket with more details, passing the index is not a problem.. This is fixed already at master. (4.0). Will merge manually thanks.. Thanks, I'll use ngIf instead.. Can you try with 2.0.2 please.. Fixed via 1594. Here we go;\n\n.

Fixed via https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/f01ab6b4765d06eab00c35d3ab71f543dc62db8a. Seems like an Angular bug.. Sounds good!. Do you mean loading more on demand via scrolling?.

I think your use case is more or less similar to autocomplete component with dropdown mode.. This is not related to PrimeNG so closing.. If you are on Angular 2, you need to use PrimeNG 2.x, like today's 2.0.4 release.. Ultima demo uses an older version of PrimeNG. It will be updated once PrimeNG 4.0 final is released.. Agreed, we need to change it for 4.1.1.. The plunkr doesn't work, any idea why? I can't replicate it with current code and Angular 4 final. How can I get the error?. Glad to hear..

Please use forum for these types of cases as it is an issue with your config.. #2307 should fix that but pInputText is not necessary in datatable so I've removed them anyway.. Please update the PR due to conflict.. Please wrap the component inside ui-fluid if inside a tight space, ui-fluid will take care of it (4.0.2). Commented on each issue to discuss.. I've tried ngDoCheck but ui-state-filled is not added or removed when typing;\n```ts\nexport class InputText implements DoCheck {\nconstructor(public el: ElementRef) {}\n\nfilled: boolean;\n\nngDoCheck() {\n    this.filled = this.el.nativeElement.value&&this.el.nativeElement.value.length;\n}\n\n}\n```\nxml\n<input id=\"in\" type=\"text\" size=\"30\" pInputText />\nIdeal solution seems to be ngDoCheck with onBlur event. ngDoCheck avoids the expression checked error and onBlur makes sure it is updated even ngModel is not used. What do you think? But as I've mentioned I couldn't replicate the expression was changed error although I had various issues with it in Angular RCs and inputText.. Ok, replicated finally. Thank you, let's resolve this today.. Weird, I see issue at plunkr but not locally with same versions. I'll merge the changes despite this as I remember having these issues with Angular 4.RC versions.. Will merge manually due to end of line character difference..

Please update the PR due to conflict.. Fixed via 3063. How about we provide a callback like timeFormatter where calendar calls your function to receive the formatted text.. Could be an input binding, not sure if it is possible to return a value from an EventEmitter if it is an @output.. I don't think we can access the content of the template to get its output so only solution I can think of @Input() to format it.. We have to keep it as it is due to backward compatibility.

I'll rethink this for 4.1.0 final, it is only necessary for resizable columns and body of scrollable table, for other cases we can avoid it. Also overlay components have appendTo=\"body\" to avoid this.. @StevenLiekens I see that as a nice addon to enhance flexibility, so that you can customize the component. About overflow, we definitely need scrollable body to be auto to get the scrollbar, for scrollheader header and footer, it has to be hidden so that we can avoid display scrollbar for them.\nFor regular cells, it makes sense for only resizable columns to be overflow hidden, I'll do this change.. I think this is already fixed.. We have autoDisplay mode in PrimeFaces which does exactly the same, adding this as an enhancement. By the way, mobile browsers like iOS execute hover on click.. Please use forum for cases like these, as for the example;\n.ui-splitbutton.custom-background-style .ui-button {\n     background: yellow;\n}.

Planned for 6.1.3.. Duplicate of 1551. @Mrtcndkn Take over please, seems like the issue we had when doing dragdrop for orderlist.. Please use forum for how-to like questions and support requests instead of issue tracker.. Doc is missing.. @Mrtcndkn @HVND Please also make sure you update documentation when adding new props;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/28613945ef069a5b4774643a0b5c1a6423aa37a3. @Mrtcndkn Take over please.. Seems by design, onMoveToSource first passes the items that are moved and then updates the list, otherwise you can't know about the items that are moved to source. One idea could be another callback like onMoveAllToSource and onMoveAllToTarget? Thoughts?. Thanks, do you expect onMoveToSource to be called in this case, I guess we should not call onMoveToSource and onMoveAllToSource at the same time so that we can separate events.. Please use forum for how-to like questions and support requests.. Please provide separate PRs and also add documentation.. No need, I'll introduce rowStyleClassMap to datatable. Thanks for the idea.. How to use it though, does user need to prepopulate rowDataMap with all potential values? If so that doesn't sound good, for example how to change row color if year of a car is older than 2010? How would you create a rowStyleMap?. Could you please create a separate issue for ngClass and class. We'll discuss rowDataStyleMap after 4.0 since it is a bit too late for a big change.. But that seems to be about dataTable#rowStyleClass again?. By the way we use [class] and [ngClass] in many places in DataTable, regardless of rowStyleClass is there any known issue for this? It seems to work fine except rowStyleClass which is subject to rewrite.. This is due to browser differences as PrimeNG uses native sort.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3026281/array-sort-sorting-stability-in-different-browsers\nI only see this behavior on chrome as the article suggests.. The PR does not use the callback right? Or is recaptchaLoaded a built-in name of recaptcha?\nI mean, shouldn't we update the demo to;\n```\n    \n\n```. Growl is deprecated, please use Toast instead which supports this.. Please use your PRO support to ask this directly to our team at pro.primefaces.org.. Please use your PRO support for question.. Please use forum for cases like these, you need to use ng-template with Angular 4 and PrimeNG 4, it supports let.. Please use forum for questions.. We don't support 2.0.x at the moment, please upgrade to 4.x.. Bettter to use attr.placeholder but I'll change it thanks.. Tracked at #2403 . Probably one of your custom styles are breaking the calendar, please use forum for questions, there is nothing wrong with the styling of calendar, issue seems to be on your side.. Do you mean dropdown functionality right? When you type list shows up but not on dropdown.. I totally understand but we still think the change is necessary and vital for performance so that is why we applied it between major versions 2->4. \nAs of PrimeNG 4.0 there are no breaking changes planned ahead as the library api is stable.. Instead of a separate component, what we can try is add an attribute like immutable (default true), if not we need to reintroduce ngDoCheck although this makes the codebase complex. Problem is Angular does not call setter if reference does not change and ngDoCheck is slow, we don't need to know what has changed in array, need to know if data has changed.. Update: ngDoCheck is back but you need to set [immutable]=\"false\". From the new docs of 4.1.RC3;\n\nDataTable either uses setter based checking or ngDoCheck to realize if the underlying data has changed to update the UI. This is configured using the immutable\n                property, when enabled (default) setter based detection is utilized so your data changes such as adding or removing a record \n                should always create a new array reference instead of manipulating an existing array as Angular does not trigger setters if the reference does not change. \n                For example, use slice instead of splice when removing an item or use spread operator instead of push method when adding an item. On the other hand, setting immutable property to false removes\n                this restriction by using ngDoCheck with IterableDiffers to listen changes without the need to create a new reference of data. Setter based method is faster however\n                both methods can be used depending on your preference. Note that immutable property also defines how DataTable treats the data, for example\n                when immutable is enabled sorting does not mutate the original data but creates a new array of sorted data.\n. Not sure about this, needs more discussion.. This is expected, known workaround is adding a similar element that causes height increase on the other side and use visibility:hidden or manually add it. We rather not deal with row calculation, you have the content so better you manage it with two solutions above. It will slow things us to find the row with max-height and apply it to all, imagine a table with many rows, faster is if you handle it in your app.. Please send a PR. Got it. Try RC5 please.. Try RC5 please.. Will do for 4.1.1.. AutoComplete has a spinner since a couple of releases back.. Added to roadmap.. It is a property of datatable not column.. But z-index is always dynamic, an overlay of any type dropdown, dialog, growl always get the highest z-index. Solution could be;\n\n.ui-growl {\n   z-index:99999999999 !important;\n}. There is baseZIndex property in recent releases.. Better would be using a custom filter with your own input, you'll have more flexibility in this case. If we'll receive more requests for this, we'll reopen.. But we'll add filterType to begin with.. This should be fixed in recent PrimeNG release, please try with it and if the issue persists drop a comment with along with a test case based on plunkr below and we'll review again.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/Wj39h1?p=preview. This was announced at blog announcement, see good-bye doCheck at;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-4-0-0-rc4-released/\nSo you need to create a new instance of array with spread operator or instead of push e.g.;\nprivate _showGrowl(params: Message) {\n    this.growlMsgs = this.growlMsg[...params];\n  }\nWe can't replicate it locally so please provide a plunkr and we'll review again.. Following works, after 3 seconds messages are cleared.\n```ts\nexport class GrowlDemo {\nmsgs: Message[] = [];\n\nshowMultiple() {\n    this.msgs = [];\n    this.msgs.push({severity:'info', summary:'Message 1', detail:'PrimeNG rocks'});\n    this.msgs.push({severity:'info', summary:'Message 2', detail:'PrimeUI rocks'});\n    this.msgs.push({severity:'info', summary:'Message 3', detail:'PrimeFaces rocks'});\n}\n\n}\n```\n```xml\n\n\n```\nTo sum up, please provide a runnable test case via plunkr.. Sticky messages dont close auto, if you push later, use spread operator instead.. I see, that is fixed via #2712 which requires to use two-way so after a message fades out or a user closes it manually, growl updates your msgs array so older ones are cleared properly from your model as well.. You need to use 4.0.1 which is not released.. We will release it tomorrow.. Use two way syntax. Two way binding might be necessary to remove the message when the user clicks the X icon of a message to update your model array.. Provide a plunkr to replicate please.. Try 4.0.2 please and provide a plunkr if issue persists.

NgModel was not updated to be the 999999 due to validation but the input was stuck at it, we call this.valueAsString = ''; which is bound to the value of the input, somehow this was working in old Angular versions.

Unfortunately as far as I know, Angular does not support variables in their animation api yet, correct me if I'm wrong, so we can't do the following;\n,\n    animations: [\n        trigger('panelState', [\n            state('hidden', style({\n                opacity: 0\n            })),\n            state('visible', style({\n                opacity: 1\n            })),\n            transition('visible => hidden', animate(animation)),\n            transition('hidden => visible', animate('400ms ease-out'))\n        ])\n    ],\n```\nexport class Dropdown {\n   @Input() animation: string = '400ms ease-in';\n\n```\nWhere animation is an attribute that can be customized but an error is given \"error TS2304: Cannot find name 'animation'.\" So there is a technical limitation here..

Not supported at the moment.. Please use forum for questions, thank you.. We'll reconsider if more users demand it. Thank you.. I'll add alwaysCenter property to center it ngAfterViewChecked. So when something changes, after dom is ready, we'll recenter. Should solve it, hopefully without side effects, default value will be false though.. Ok now Dialog centers itself after its content is ready, I've also realized that this fixes some positioning issues in the demos like DataGrid demo where content is dynamic.. Should work just by default after 4.1.RC3 (tomorrow). Reopened due to community request, will be reviewed for 5.2.1. Regarding issue tracker in general, we are doing everything we can, we've reviewed/resolved 3788 issues so far and there are 533 open where most of them are feature requests. PRs will definitely help in general, let's improve it together.. I forgot to reopen after my previous comment.. My test is this;\nxml\n<p-dialog header=\"Godfather I\" [(visible)]=\"display\" modal=\"modal\" [responsive]=\"true\" [width]=\"300\" [minWidth]=\"200\">\n           <p>Unrelated content.</p>\n           <p *ngIf=\"displayDynamic\" style=\"height:100px\">\n               Dynamic Content\n           </p>\n           <ul>\n               <li *ngFor=\"let item of items\">{{item}}</li>\n           </ul>\n           <p-footer>\n                <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-search\" (click)=\"displayDynamic = !displayDynamic\" label=\"Toggle\"></button>\n                <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-check\" (click)=\"add()\" label=\"Add\"></button>\n           </p-footer>\n    </p-dialog>\nSo one button toggles the visibility of a p element with 100px height and other ones adds items to the list displayed by the list. These two buttons are used to change the content of the dialog dynamically.\nI've seen the issue where the dialog position stays same in this case and can think of a way to take this.\nIf at ngAfterViewChecked callback of dialog.ts itself, we call positionOverlay() function, then after the change detection runs and view is updated, dialog realigns itself. My concern here is that this function is called many many times by Angular so we need to do this if dialog is visible. If it is hidden then it is positioned already after it gets shown so both cases are covered.\nI've committed the change, please test it with 5.2.1 due March 7th and drop a comment here about the results. The change fixes the issues of my test case and hopefully yours.\n. Is this on 5.2.2? It seems we should avoid reposition when content does not change. Will check it now.. New idea was to check the height at on show and at afterViewChecked, check to see if height is different which means the content has changed dynamically, if so then reposition;\n```typescript\n        else if(this.visible) {\n            this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {\n                setTimeout(() => {\n                    let height = this.domHandler.getOuterHeight(this.containerViewChild.nativeElement);\n                if(height !== this.currentHeight) {\n                    this.currentHeight = height;\n                    this.positionOverlay();\n                }\n            }, 100);\n        });\n    }\n\n```\nIt fails without setTimeout as Angular's ngAfterViewChecked is somewhat broken, it gets invoked before the dom update is finished so I can't check the new height without it, ngZone is there to avoid recursive calls, since setTimeout will call ngAfterViewChecked again.\nThis is the only potential solution to reposition.\nAnother workaround is fixing the content section;\nxml\n<p-dialog [contentStyle]=\"{'max-height': '400px'}\"\nSo that dynamically changed content does not change the coordinates of the dialog, a scrollbar will display for longer content.\nWdyt?\nMaybe we can do the automatic positioning a property like autoAlign=\"true|false\"?\nI'm leaning towards max-height on contentStyle, it seems to be a valid workaround.. Ok, I've changed the auto align behavior to check the height instead. It is on by default but can be turned off with [autoAlign]=\"false\" just in case. Also added a doc and released 5.2.3, try with it please.. 5.2.3 is released now.. Thank you, since it is stable now I can add maximize minimize like PrimeFaces has\ud83d\ude09\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/overlay/dialog/minMax.xhtml. Not sure, if more users demand it we'll reconsider. Right now, it is easy though, you can clean them from your model by clearing the model array where you can bind this to a UI of your preference, like a button placed next to chips.. defaultDate is to display the month-year, to apply value use value property instead. Use case is where you have a default value but want to open calendar on another date different then value. In your case, please use ngModel instead of defaultDate.. Can't replicate, please provide a plunkr and we'll reopen. Tested on showcase code with;\nxml\n    <p-dialog header=\"Godfather I\" [(visible)]=\"display\" modal=\"modal\" width=\"350\" [responsive]=\"true\">\n           <p-inputSwitch [(ngModel)]=\"checked1\"></p-inputSwitch>\n    </p-dialog>. Please use forum for questions.. appendTo=\"body\" is one solution, other is setting [style]=\"{'overflow':'visible'}\" on column.. It is a bit uncommon as positioning is usually top, left in box model. If more users demand it, we'll reconsider. Thank you.. I think this is expected, resizable columns get \"fixed width\", they will display a scrollbar to avoid overflow to support window width changes.. It is a bit uncommon as positioning is usually top, left in box model. If more users demand it, we'll reconsider. Thank you.. The issue is too broad, most of them bind/unbind them when necessary (dialog may not be one of them), please create a separate issue for each specific component that you experience this and we'll take care of it.. I can't replicate it at showcase, using left right keys, I can navigate other radios as we use a hidden native radio inside to do it.

This is fixed now but there is an important change, dropdown now handles the search itself to make it easier since you need to do a query manually on onDropdownClick yourself. New behavior eliminates this by introducing dropdownMode property. From the new docs;\n\nEnabling dropdown property displays a button next to the input field where click behavior of the button is defined using dropdownMode property that takes \"blank\" or \"current\" as possible values. \"blank\" is the default mode to send a query with an empty string whereas \"current\" setting sends a query with the current value of the input.\n\nAlso please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/3956\nMy suggestion would be updating to new version and removing your onDropdownClick handler..

Reviewing this now, our response time for community issues may take up to 1 or 2 months I'm afraid, this is due to the popularity, we've just reached 1 million downloads, please keep submitting PRs and it will definitely be reviewed in a couple of weeks. This is how open source works, I'm doing it for 10+ years, there is PrimeNG PRO to secure our response within 1 business day. Project is way too popular to respond instantly so everything is reviewed with a delay because of the reasons above.\nThis one particularly has been created 21 days ago which is not bad :) Our capacity for each release (every two-three) weeks is to review 100 community issues and all the PRs submitted during this period.\nAlso so far close to 3000 community issues are reviewed and closed, so out of 3500, we've done a lot of work on the 3000 issues. If you see it from this point of view, it is easy to understand how much work has been done.

We'll also make the individual css of components for 5.1.0-RC! so you can import what you require as well instead of whole css. PrimeNG is a suite so no plans to use style or styleURL which always caused problems for us due to view encapsulation. Still we may reconsider that in future, having said that publishing individual css of components will help your requirement, I'll also update the docs for this in detail in a section called smaller bundles :). This is a huge change, we need to make sure backward compatibility such as premium themes and so on. First let me do add css to the distro and then test using styles or styleUrls..

We've added a demo, it is up to you how you implement it, new TurboTable does not limit this like the old one.. No you don't, old one is p-dataTable, new one is p-table. It is being documented now to be released next week. The route seems to be missing yes, we'll add it. Note that TurboTable is beta and will be prod ready in 5.2 release due mid february. . There is no backwards compatibility because it is a brand new component. Old one still works but will be phased out in a future release. There are similarities but also significant differences.

DataTable is deprecated and will be removed in favor of new p-table (aka TurboTable) of 5.1.0 so closing the issue.. These filters should better be used, I'd suggest moving them to objectUtils so other form components like Listbox, multi select can use them.. This is expected, dropdown is not suitable to display huge number of data, try an alternate ui instead like an AutoComplete.. DataTable is deprecated in favor new p-table and not maintained anymore.. @Merve7 Please check this one.. By the way, Ultima forum is better to get faster responses as this tracker is for PrimeNG.. Spinner does not support [ngModelOptions]=\"{updateOn: 'blur'}\". p-dataTable is deprecated in favour new p-table so we're not doing any changes on p-dataTable. Would be glad if you port this to p-table.. That is expected, onSelect is for selecting with mouse.

We'll be at NgConf in mid april so new p-treeTable will be ready by then. We've waited to make sure TurboTable gets stable before building new TreeTable on top of it.. It should be ready by the end of April so 1 month from now.. Implementation starts next week, I'll keep you updated here.. Implementation has started yesterday, should be available next week with 6.0.0-alpha.2.\n\n. Not sure how a TreeTable can be responsive though.. What we have now is;\n\n\n. It is very flexible as you have full control over the markup, I've created a demo using simple media queries.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/showcase/components/treetable/treetableresponsivedemo.ts\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/showcase/components/treetable/treetableresponsivedemo.html. All features that I've listed in the original post has been completed and new TreeTable will be released with alpha.2 in a couple of days, it is being documented now. Would be great to receive feedback before 6.0 final.. Use paginatorLeftTemplate and paginatorRightTemplate to add your refresh icon to reset the data or do something else. Templating will be the better solution here in case of us adding refresh icons.. We'll reconsider if more users demand this.. DataTable is deprecated in favor new p-table which already supports this.. Not sure, let's wait for more feedback. It would be confusing for the user to hide the item after move as well. That's another point of view.. This is expected due to interpolation, Angular does display them as they are and we rather not use innerHTML here. You can use header component with custom content for dialog though with innerHTML.. TurboTable is not released yet, please do not create issues for an unreleased component.. This happened to us before and upgrading node.js fixes it.. Unable to replicate, please provide a plunkr at;\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/qtZi5lB3DjkNt7Kdivg9?p=preview. This is expected, list is actually another element which causes blur of the input when clicked.. Seems to be fixed in after 5.0.2, I can see it exported, still you should import from \"primeng/card\" instead.. DataTable is deprecated and maintained anymore in favor of new p-table so closing the issues. Note that p-table should have this working fine.. Does not state what has been fixed.. It works for me at primeng-quickstart-cli, please compare;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng-quickstart-cli\nI'm unable to replicate.. I've replicated the situation, thank you for the feedback. For my case it only happens on AOT build with prod. Adding d.ts files fixes this, so we'll do an 5.2.RC2 on 22nd with these changes.. d.ts files of single modules will also be published to npm now which fixes the issue.. Sorry, we can't replicate and many users reported that issue is fixed.. Please use forum for questions instead of issue tracker.\n1 - Can't replicate\n2 - See sorting section\n3 - You should be\n4 - Not sure what you mean boy dynamic scrollHeight. I think it is there mathematically, the shadow makes it look different.. Sorry, bootstrap theme is deprecated in favor of Avalon.. Behavior is correct due to Angular syntax..

Not sure, it throws validation error in validate mode though.. #4870. DataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore in favor of p-table aka TurboTable of 5.2.. Added the version to the footer, for older versions you can run them locally by forking from the tags. We rather not deploy all 80+ releases to the public demo.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4908\nand\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4911. No plans to support it at the moment.. Yes, columns should be dynamic for export to work, I've added this to the docs now.. I'm unable to replicate, sorry. Please compare your project with;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng-quickstart-cli\nIt uses new 'primeng/{module}' convention.. On the long run, it is better to handle these with locales, otherwise we'll end up duplicating all locale props.. We'll check this to make it smoother after 5.2.. Try with 5.2.3 please, should work with it.. Try 5.2.-RC1 please.. Could you please add a plunkr?. 4868. Can you send us a sample project to help us replicate, we've tried several times with no luck.. Can you please create a file name button.d.ts under node_modules/primeng with the following content and try again;\nbutton.d.ts\nexport * from './components/button/button';. \nSo that node_modules/primeng/button.js and node_modules/primeng/button.d.ts look side by side. . Tracked at;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4841. DataTable is deprecated and will be removed in the future in favor of new p-table, please try the new table which should not have this issue.. Which theme are you using?. RC2 should fix the import issue.. @lr12003 Premiums have their own sass based styling, already done and will be released with 5.2. final m next week. Verona will be updated as well.. Border widths are not defined by table.css, it is responsibility of themes, the free themes have;\n.ui-table-thead > tr > th,\n    .ui-table-tfoot > tr > td {\n        background: $headerBgColor;\n        border: 1px solid $headerBorderColor;\n        color: $headerTextColor;\n    }\nAnd I can see the borders at showcase, seems like a custom theme issue on your side.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/4d611945ec2aa4fdbcfd14897290d5cf8caf2ee6. 4910. 4862. p-dataTable is deprecated in favor p-table so we're unable to accept this request. p-table will get a custom sort function in 5.2.RC2 though this week.. #4295. Good catch! It was not removed but left out of the scope of 5.2.RC1, we'll do it now for RC2.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/f13926c8b7fb30a7b4642c80c3feddab6a778df1. How can we rep. I don't think it is possible, you need to write your own exporter. You may use the one from PrimeNG to get an idea.. Sounds good to me.. Tracked at https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4908. It is a known issue that was left out in RC1 so good catch :). You can do;\nxml\n<p-table [value]=\"cars\">\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\">\n            <tr>\n                <th>Vin</th>\n                <th>Year</th>\n                <th>Brand</th>\n                <th>Color</th>\n            </tr>\n        </ng-template>\n        <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-car>\n            <tr (dblclick)=\"onRowDblClick($event, car)\">\n                <td>{{car.vin}}</td>\n                <td>{{car.year}}</td>\n                <td>{{car.brand}}</td>\n                <td>{{car.color}}</td>\n            </tr>\n        </ng-template>\n    </p-table>\nonRowDblClick(event, rowData) {\n     //\n}. This is a known case with chrome;\nhttps://inderpreetsingh.com/2010/12/01/chromes-javascript-sort-array-function-is-different-yet-proper/. Duplicate of 4863. Fixed due to recent changes on filtering, I can't nail the exact commit though, there had been a couple along with 4889.. Better to handle on your side with hover with css.. I'm sorry but I have to close this because DataTable is not maintained anymore in favor of p-table.. You can use ngSwitch for an example, here is dynamic columns with different filter elements for header;\nxml\n<th *ngFor=\"let col of columns\" [ngSwitch]=\"col.field\">\n                    <input *ngSwitchCase=\"'vin'\" pInputText type=\"text\" (input)=\"dt.filter($event.target.value, col.field, col.filterMatchMode)\">\n                    <div *ngSwitchCase=\"'year'\">\n                        {{yearFilter}}\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-close\" (click)=\"yearFilter=null;dt.filter(null, col.field, col.filterMatchMode)\" style=\"cursor:pointer\"></i>\n                        <p-slider [style]=\"{'width':'100%','margin-top':'8px'}\" [(ngModel)]=\"yearFilter\" [min]=\"1970\" [max]=\"2010\" (onChange)=\"onYearChange($event, dt)\"></p-slider>\n                    </div>\n                    <p-dropdown *ngSwitchCase=\"'brand'\" [options]=\"brands\" [style]=\"{'width':'100%'}\" (onChange)=\"dt.filter($event.value, col.field, 'equals')\"></p-dropdown>\n                    <p-multiSelect *ngSwitchCase=\"'color'\" [options]=\"colors\" defaultLabel=\"All Colors\" (onChange)=\"dt.filter($event.value, col.field, 'in')\"></p-multiSelect>\n                </th>\nSame applies to body as well so you can change what to display per column body e.g. pipes .... #4841\nAlso you should not use primeng/primeng, try primeng/table.. @mertsincan You had worked on this before? What is the solution?. Nodes with short names also are disconnected. But docs of chart.js does not suggest that;\nhttp://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/responsive.html. I can't replicate with latest changes so assuming that it got fixed by now, if issue persists, please create a new issue ticket.. DataTable is deprecated in favor new p-table so not maintained anymore. Please migrate to new p-table.. Resetting page is by design, these should be options at least, not all user may like it.. Delay is handy to avoid closing the menu if users moves quickly, still set to 250ms to hide it faster..     @Input() get sticky(): boolean {\n        return this.sticky;\n    }\nThis calls for a stack overflow error by the way.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4759. There is selectedItemTemplate for this.. #3548. You need to use colgroup;\n<p-table [columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"cars\" [scrollable]=\"true\" scrollHeight=\"200px\">\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"colgroup\" let-columns>\n        <colgroup>\n            <col *ngFor=\"let col of columns\" [style.width]=\"col.width\">\n        </colgroup>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\" let-columns>\n        <tr>\n            <th *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{col.header}}\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n        <tr>\n            <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{rowData[col.field]}}\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n</p-table>. This is expected due to layout:fixed;\n.ui-table table {\n    table-layout:auto !important;\n}\nFixes this, will add a property to expose this.. If you enable autoLayout, that would correct things in 5.2-RC2. Does not seem PrimeNG related..

I'm sorry but I have to close this because DataTable is not maintained anymore in favor of p-table.. Provide a plunkr please, otherwise we won't be able to work on it as this is not something we can replicate.. Please use forum for questions..

Create a plunkr please if you like this to be reviewed.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/Nxca3ovCbtvx9kpGds0q?p=preview. If more users demand it, why not. Right now only 2 up votes. We probably need 20 and so to do it.. Unable to replicate with 5.2.3.. Technically there is no built-in row groups as it is easy to do with templating;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/rowgroup\nSo sorting could be done on your side, I guess we can add this to demo but neither of these are built-in features rather extensions.. These features are added in 5.2.0-RC2 so you'd need RC2 to avoid this error.. There is no built-in row groups functionality, there is a demo to show how can be done in one way, so it is up to you how to do the sorting, note that there is customSorting available as well if you'd like to customize.. No, keyFilter checks the current key, it is a common misunderstanding. You need to enable validation mode to enable whole value.. You can have dynamic columns + filtering using ngSwitch, actually static columns is easier. Not sure why it hasn't worked for you. Could be;\nxml\ndt.filter($event.target.value, 'userId', 'contains')\". We've settled on myFormGroup.controls['cities']. We've settled on myFormGroup.controls['cities']. Border widths should not by defined table.css, it is responsibility of themes, the free themes have;\n.ui-table-thead > tr > th,\n.ui-table-tfoot > tr > td {\n    background: $headerBgColor;\n    border: 1px solid $headerBorderColor;\n    color: $headerTextColor;\n}\n\nAnd I can see the borders at showcase, seems like a custom theme issue on your side.. Unable to replicate with 5.2.3.. This is by design, you have full control over the presentation so it is up to you, Table just gives you the metadata, it is in your control on how to display it. Image you are doing a list with *ngFor with this case, how would you display nested fields? Same applies here as well. Probably a helper in your project to resolve fields similar to ObjectUtils.resolveFieldData in PrimeNG.. Seems documentation lacks the necessary information, to get the data and field at onEditComplete, you need to define it as;\n<td [pEditableColumn]=\"rowData\" [pEditableColumnField]=\"'year'\">\nI've added this to the docs now, finally about onEdit, actually there is no edit since we can't properly catch the edit event, it can be with mouse or with keyboard, so in your custom editor, you can use the event you like such as keyup, change, blur to know about when the data is edited. TurboTable provides edit events related to the state of the cell including;\n\nonEditInit: Cell becomes editable\nonEditComplete: Enter key causes cell to switch to readonly mode\nonEditCancel: Escape key causes cell to switch to readonly mode so you can reset the model if required.. p-dataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table..

Not a valid issue ticket, please use forum for cases like these in the future. As with Angular, PrimeNG can be used for PWA.. I'm unable to replicate, provide a plunkr please.. Not a PrimeNG issue.. This is not a valid issue ticket, it misses a plunkr to demonstrate the issue. Please follow the issue guideline before creating new issues.\nLive examples work by the way.. Sounds like related to;\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/37190016/orderby-is-sorting-differently-in-chrome-than-other-browsers\nYou may try sortFunction to take over browser sorting.. Will fix it on our end, thanks.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5303. We'll check the #1 but #2 requires a rewrite and not sure if it is a vital problem on smaller screens anyway.. Need more feedback on this, maybe users want to expand it on click. Maybe an attribute it needed to make it customizable.. Try with Angular 5.2.x please.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5004. Please use Ultima forum not the PrimeNG issue tracker to report issues: Ultima does not support PrimeNG 5.2 yet and we've mentioned on release announcements that premium themes will have problems with menus and TurboTable so they will be updated when 5.2 comes out.. Not in our immediate plans due to other tasks with higher priority, I don't have a date sorry.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6025. No, but we can use this issue to create a feature.. Issue is not clear to me, please follow the issue ticket creation guide.. This is no a valid issue ticket. Issue is not clear, no plunkr is provided. Please follow the issue creating guideline. And always try with the latest PrimeNG.. Issue is not clear to me, please read the issue guide.. p-dataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table.. DataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore in favor of p-table, please use p-table instead.. I don't understand various design decisions in this PR so closing like blocking text selection and changes to onNodeClick vs, we'll implement it ourselves in a future release.. Will be documented.. Unable to replicate, please provide a plunkr at;\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/qtZi5lB3DjkNt7Kdivg9?p=preview. Please create a plunkr using;\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/Nxca3ovCbtvx9kpGds0q?p=preview\nSo that we can see the issue in action. Added to plan of 5.2.1. Thanks, added after refactor.. Sorry, Unable to replicate.. Since you have full control over the editor template, you can decide to call complete on blur. We rather not do it, as there may have multiple editors inside a single cell where calling complete on blur may not be desired behavior for some users.. So this happens when there is a dialog around? This famous error is too common in dev mode and caused when something changes after angular runs change detection.. Anyone else still having this after 5.2.3?. primeng/primeng is deprecated so we're not adding the new TurboTable to it to promote 'primeng/table';. If more users demand it, we'll consider this.. We'll reconsider if more users demand it. Not sure if it is a common case to change the format or icon during runtime.. Please use forum for questions not the issue tracker.. You need to use a colgroup, please check out the documentation.. A colgroup is required to support resize + scroll.. Sorry but this can't be supported, we've worked on this before, there are various technical limitations.. let-data=\"$implicit\"\nSee ngTemplateOutlet API for more information.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5032. This has been discussed a couple of times, we use browser sorting so it is up to browsers how to handle sorting. If you prefer to take over sorting, you can use customSort feature or use lazy loading, in both cases you can plug-in your own sorting.. You need to use .ui-fluid so that components inside this class goes to fluid mode. Example;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/apollo-ng/#/forms\n<div class=\"ui-fluid\">\n    //primeng components as descendants\n</div>. It is not a good engineering practice to load 22k to your user's browsers. You should really use lazy loading for 22k entries as result will be the same when you use a simple ngFor instead of p-table.. [paginatorPosition]=\"'both'\"\nor\npaginatorPosition=\"'both'\". Is this for VirtualScrolling on p-table? Provide a plunkr please to have your issues be worked on.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5303. There is metaKeySelection in p-table to change this.. This is not a valid issue ticket, it misses a plunkr to demonstrate the issue. Please follow the issue guideline before creating new issues..

Unable to replicate, please provide a plunkr at;\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/qtZi5lB3DjkNt7Kdivg9?p=preview. This depends on the theme you use where you can customize this behavior.. Provide a plunkr please for your issues to be reviewed.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5032. Fixed at;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5215. Seems like an angular bug to me, by the way, removing   [multiple]=\"false\" fixes the problem.. See #5037. If you are referring to p-table, you have full control over the filter elements so you can apply debounce on keystroke.. If you have custom width at headers, then you need to add the same to the body as well. We sure can add this to the docs. Easiest way is using a colgroup template though since it will be moved to header and body divs, so widths can be managed from a single element instead of two here. Image you have a footer, that makes it 3.. Fixed with a different syntax, thanks.. Duplicate https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4741. Thank you for the update.. I don't understand this, to begin with there is no built-in feature in TurboTable called RowGrouping, I've added that as a demo since it is easy to do with templating features of TurboTable which is not the case with p-dataTable that has built-in row grouping. So TurboTable is not aware of RowGrouping actually, if you have already sorted data, just don't define sortField-sortOrder at all. It is defined in demo because demo data in sorted, if your data is sorted and you don't need sorting just turn it off. What am I missing?. Please use forum for questions.. We can do this if there is more demand for sure.. Documentation covers this with potential solutions as well.. Please use forum for questions and seek assistance.. Fix is adding ui-resizable-column to td as well;\n<p-table [columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"cars1\" [resizableColumns]=\"true\">\n        <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\" let-columns>\n            <tr>\n                <th *ngFor=\"let col of columns\" pResizableColumn>\n                    {{col.header}}\n                </th>\n            </tr>\n        </ng-template>\n        <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n            <tr>\n                <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\" class=\"ui-resizable-column\">\n                    {{rowData[col.field]}}\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </ng-template>\n    </p-table>. Nope,  \".ui-table .ui-table-tfoot > tr > td {\" should not get overflow hidden as it will block dropdowns.  \nStill needs fixing though.. Glad to hear.. See;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5098. Ran your samples, unable to replicate with 5.2.4, seems it has been fixed already after recent improvements to scrolling tables.. Should be fixed by 5.2.x.. Sorry too many changes for us to consume and accept, it is one of those features that should be implemented by our team as stated on the pull request description.. Please use PrimeReact issue tracker, not the PrimeNG. Thank you.. As TreeTable will be reimplemented in upcoming 6.0, closing this issue.. This is fixed in recent release, please upgrade to 5.2.4 or newer.. This is weird, not sure why it fails like that, it is due to index of ngFor, if you use a column index it works;\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n            <tr>\n                <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\" pEditableColumn>\n                    <p-cellEditor>\n                        <ng-template pTemplate=\"input\">\n                            {{i}} - \n                            <input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"rowData[col]\">\n                        </ng-template>\n                        <ng-template pTemplate=\"output\">\n                            {{rowData[col]}}\n                        </ng-template>\n                    </p-cellEditor>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </ng-template>\nthis.cols = [\n            0,1,2,3,4\n        ];. show() requires the input to be focused.. Some parts of the PR are a bit too much so we'll merge partially.. This is not a PrimeNG issue, refer to Angular CLI for details.. p-dataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table.. DataTable is deprecated so closing the issue, note that this is trivial to do in p-table as you have full control over the rows and cells so you can place your label inside the header.. This is by design, row selection is not triggered on click of clickable elements like inputs, p-dataTable is same as well.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5098. Let's check this out for 5.2.1 then.. I like the solution of @joelbinn and committed it, thank you guys.. It works fine in our test cases.. See;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5098. DataTable is deprecated, please use TurboTable instead.. We can replicate the issue with 5.2.4, it works like you have described, please provide a sample at;\nhttps://stackblitz.com/github/primefaces/primeng-issue-template. You need to create a wrapper div that contains the button and the overlay panel and append the overlap to this div. Tooltip documentation has an example.. Please use Ultima forum not the PrimeNG issue tracker.. Sorry but as mentioned on PR policy, new feature requests should be handled by our team. We accept PRs for defect fixes mostly.. Please refer to the fileupload documentation, I guess you need the customUpload as enabled.. Please create the issue in PrimeFaces.. Not a PrimeNG issue and not a valid issue ticket.. Set to 5.2.5.. PR merged, thank you.. Update the PrimeNG version to latest to get this feature please.. Please try with 5.2.4 and newer, should be fixed with it.. Work has started for alpha-3;\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/primeicons\nNote that this change breaks the dependency of PrimeNG to Font-Awesome 4.x and makes it possible to use it with any FA version since PrimeNG does not depend on FA anymore.. I've reintroduced metaKeySelection to 5.2.x recently.. DataTable is deprecated, please use p-table instead.. Please use forum for questions.. No description is available in the PR, selection and editable cells leads to a confusing ux.. Unable to replicate;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/contextmenu. Glad to hear.. Will check the docs again.. Docs fixed.. Added differently, thanks. We don't really need the index.. The upcoming metaKeySelection option can cover this as it does in p-dataTable.. This is documented;\nTable can export its data in CSV format using exportCSV() method. By default whole data is exported, if you'd like to export only the selection then pass a config object with selectionOnly property as true. Note that  columns should be dynamic for export functionality to work and column objects must define field/header properties.. You can style the th, td or col elements.. Not a PrimeNG issue, you need to import FormsModule.. Please update to latest PrimeNG to have this issue resolved.. Not a valid issue ticket, there is an issue with your setup.. Available in 5.2.5.\n\n. TreeTable will be in PrimeNG 6.0 due end of May, 4813 contains this issue as well.. According to the chart.js, width and height to the canvas is wrong;\nhttp://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/responsive.html\nSo we need to apply them maybe if chart is not responsive?. Fixed according to the suggestions of charts.js docs, the PR might have caused blur plots for responsive charts. Added docs as well.\nResponsive\nCharts are responsive by default and vw-vh units should be used when customizing the width and height of the chart.\nxml\n<p-chart type=\"line\" [data]=\"data\" width=\"40w\" height=\"80w\"></p-chart>\nIf the chart is not responsive, other units should be preferred.\nxml\n<p-chart type=\"line\" [data]=\"data\" width=\"400px\" height=\"400px\" [responsive]=\"false\"></p-chart>. PR merged.. Will check this.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5243. Rest of the code is wrong in PR actually. Fixed it.. Yes, row class per row is pretty common so I've added a demo;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/style. Maybe we can add an option.. You can solve this by adding [resetPageOnSort]=\"false\", available in upcoming 5.2.5. . Duplicate;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5008. #5004 . I think you need to import the router in your plunkr as well? Not a PrimeNG core issue so closing.. There are already menuStyle and menuStyleClass for SplitButton, renamed like these since they are menus.. Unable to replicate, provide a plunrk please.. I don't think this is PrimeNG related, it seems a config issue on your end.. We could not see the issue, please provide a plunkr;\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/qtZi5lB3DjkNt7Kdivg9?p=preview. As we're unable to replicate, if the issue still persists, please create a new ticket and provide a stackblitz link that demonstrates the problem;\nhttps://stackblitz.com/github/primefaces/primeng-issue-template. Glad to hear.. Do you use ui-grid or ui-g? Still I've added box border-box to ui-g. Note that ui-grid is deprecated. Please use forum for support requests and questions.. DataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table instead.. I think there is an issue with your configuration, unable to replicate the problem. Provide a plunkr if it helps.. Hi guys, we can't replicate at;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/filter\nAny chance for a plunkr or a scenario we can check online?. Glad to hear.. DataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table instead.. You need to change the locale object instance instead of setting a property of it, other wise change will not be detected so a new reference of locale object needs to be created;\nchangeLocale() {\n        this.locale = {\n            firstDayOfWeek: 0,\n            dayNames: [\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\"],\n            dayNamesShort: [\"Sun\", \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\"],\n            dayNamesMin: [\"Su\",\"Mo\",\"Tu\",\"We\",\"Th\",\"Fr\",\"Sa\"],\n            monthNames: [ \"January\",\"February\",\"March\",\"April\",\"May\",\"June\",\"July\",\"August\",\"September\",\"October\",\"November\",\"December\" ],\n            monthNamesShort: [ \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\",\"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\" ],\n            today: 'Today',\n            clear: 'Clear'\n        };\n    }. TreeTable will be reimplemented so not accepting issues for the current one.. Merged the PR.. DataTable is deprecated, please use p-table instead.. Please use forum for questions.. There is pSortableColumnDisabled property to dusable sorting in dynamic colums.. DataTable is deprecated, please use p-table instead.. DataTable is deprecated, please use p-table instead.. Table uses Slice Pipe so solution could be converting it to an array, a plunkr can help as well.. Try with 5.2.4 please.. Fixed differently, thank.. Closing due to lack of plunkr.. DataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table instead.. Issue is too broad, please create separate tickets for the ones that they need it.. Will review for 5.2.4.. This is expected behavior because the table in plunkr has row selection and checkbox selection enabled which conflicts, you should not used them both at the same time since they are alternatives.. Was fixed lately, thank you.. Fixed already.. Merged manually, thanks.. 5.2.5.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/873. @Merve7 Please create a new repo for test cases.. According to the chart.js, width and height to the canvas is wrong;\nhttp://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/responsive.html. Will do it on our side.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5126#issuecomment-370218747. Why not add\ncss\n.ui-table table {\n   //your styles\n}. Try with 5.2.4 please.. Should be fixed in 5.2.4.. My mistake of forgetting the [], docs fixed now at master.. Issue is fixed, also for smooth scrolling updated the docs where tr should also get a height.\nxml\n<p-table [columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"virtualCars\" [scrollable]=\"true\" [rows]=\"20\" scrollHeight=\"200px\" [virtualRowHeight]=\"30\"\n    [virtualScroll]=\"true\" (onLazyLoad)=\"loadDataOnScroll($event)\" [lazy]=\"true\" [totalRecords]=\"totalRecords\">\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\" let-columns>\n        <tr>\n            <th *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{col.header}}\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n        <tr style=\"height:30px\">\n            <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{rowData[col.field]}}\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n</p-table>. You may try PUSH change detection so other components do not get change detection. Should be fixed in 5.2.4. Please use forum for questions and suggestions.. Not PrimeNG related.. DataTable is deprecated and not maintained anymore, please consider migrating to p-table instead.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/586. Issue is not clear.. Better to have separate attributes like infoIcon, messageIcon, by the way you can already override then with css :before.. It is unlikely that screen is that small to try left and right so they are neglected.. The issue is too broad, please create separate tickets as the component is very complex with a lot of elements. For example, some of the elements already have keyboard support, we need more details with a separate issue ticket.. Reverted due to aot errors. I like it, will do.. Dangerous change to change all buttons as it has no splitbutton related part, the fix is already done earlier this week.. Use forum for questions please.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5004. TreeTable will be reimplemented soon so we're not maintaining current one at the moment.. Please use forum for questions.. Report at Barcelona-NG forum please, this is the tracker for PrimeNG.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4985. Not a valid issue ticket.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4530. If more users demand this behavior we'll re-evaluate, currently no plans to change the current behavior as it will add complexity. But if there is more demand, why not. We'll reopen if more users request it at forums and issue tracker. Thank you for the feedback.. Provide a plunkr please, I can't see the issue.. See\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5291. There is no component for this.. I've worked on this, using the case in plunkr the table has no chance to update itself because scrollHeight changes are listened meaning at on load 100% is converted to pixels. When you change the parent, it is outside the scope of table, so table has no chance to recalculate. In the plunkr, you mauy just go ahead and give the same height of the container to the scrollHeight as well but probably your real case is where scroll height needs to be adjusted according to the viewport, so why not using vh unit e.g. scrollHeight=\"75vh\". % is relative to the parent, vh is relative to the page.. Unable to replicate locally, please create a new issue when the plunkr is ready so we can take a look.. Doesn't seem to be an issue with showcase that runs on 5.2.\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/chart/bar\nPlease compare with the live code.. Please use forum for support requests.. I don't think a built-in label is necessary from UX point of view.. This seems to be related to the quill not PrimeNG.. Fixed via;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5080. \n\n. Merged manually, thanks.. badges are used in menus premium templates at the moment as far as I know, we sure can add support to p-menu* as well in the future. . Should apply to li. I'm unable to replicate.. Sorry for the confusion, live demo runs on 5.2.1-snapshot, DataView is not in 5.2.0 but in 5.2.1.. Not sure to call onMonthChange at year change.. selectEvent is only fired when a date is selected with a mouse event, you need to use onBlur or onInput instead when dealing with an input.. Unable to replicate, make sure you have a new reference of the selection property instead such as;\nthis.selectedCars1 = this.selectedCars1.filter((item, index) => index !== 0);\nAbove removes the first item from selection and label will be updated properly.. Works for me at;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/autocomplete\n. 5.2.2 is now published with this fix and others;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-5-2-2-released/. 5.2.2 is now published with this fix and others;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-5-2-2-released/. All fixed separately already before seeing this, thanks for the PR though.. Replicated. Fixed already.. Performance of TurboTable is similar to native *ngFor as it uses it. So your case is not related to PrimeNG but with Angular itself, I've tried with an ngFor without TurboTable to render 5K rows with 8 columns and results are same. You should really check out pagination, virtual scrolling works for me fine as well, not sure how you implement it on your side. 5K array should not be in array, you should get it with lazy loading from the serve 40 by 40.. [metaKeySelection]=\"true\". #5280. Merged. Fixed as well.. You need PrimeNG 5.2 for this.. #5271. Not the best location to do it, as it will run at every scroll, causing perf issues.. Not sure about better UX, never heard of case like this. If more users demand it we'll reconsider, thank you.. I'm unable to replicate.. Unable to replicate, a plunkr will help.. I think this is quill related, not PrimeNG.. Please try the new TreeTable as this issue is related to the old one.. Try 5.2.3 please, that should fix it.. p-button is a custom element, you can use id property on it.. Please create a new issue with a stackblitz template that demonstrates the issue.. Breaks horizontal scrolling and has issues with frozen columns so reverted.. The patch has no effect in my tests, better part to add support for scrolling contains might be the aligning calculations.. As I've mentioned, it got no effect at all in my tests. I've added another fix though.. Merged manually. Merged. Fixed already yes.. Please see;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5853. As the value is changed, we must call onChange since model is updated. The behavior depends on browsers for native select and p-dropdown picks an opinion.. Please use forum for questions.. Issue is related to chart.js.. There is spinner code so will fix manually. It is not clear to me what this PR does at all.. It is not clear to me what the PR does.. PR merged.. Please use forum for support requests.. Merged PR. There are technical limitations for this, assume if there is a component that has an overlay panel like dropdown, calendar and if the panel is appended to the body, clicking the panel will close the cell.. Fixed in 6.0.0-beta.1 in another case.. @tigrenok00 This is from the issue template;\n```\nIf you have a PrimeNG PRO Support subscription please post your issue at;\nhttps://pro.primefaces.org \nwhere our team will respond within 4 business hours.\nIf you do not have a PrimeNG PRO Support subscription, fill-in the report below.

Feel free to send a PR if you have a solution.. When the minDate and maxDate changes, the calendar re renders the UI, when these values are bound to functions Angular does not even trigger the onDateSelect event so can't think of a way to support such cases. Solution is to keep your min/max in separate variables like maxDate1 and minDate2, at onDateSelect you need to update these variables. This will prevent the event issues and will be more performant.. Thank you. @Merve7 Please check this.. Since it is a lazy table, you need to update totalRecords as well so that paginator can adjust.. DataTable is deprecated in favor of new TurboTable so not maintained anymore. Also your PrimeNG version is very old, it needs an update.. You can use *ngSwitch, there is an example at;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/filter. Added closeCellEdit. Fixed via PR, thank you.. Please use the Avalon-NG support forum;\nhttps://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=70\nAnd our team will assist.. You can use metaKeySelection to configure these behaviors. Also if issue persists, please create a new ticket with a stackblitz template.. Please use forum for questions and help requests.. We can add a demo but this better not be built-in. I'll ask a teammate to create the demo.. If you bind to the first property, changing it programmatically will cause pagination.. You need to implement filter-sort yourself if lazy is enabled by hitting the backend.. Unable to replicate, please try with 6.x, there was a related issue fixed.. This is expected, disabled elements can't receive focus.. Like [dataKey]=\"['vin','brand']\"?. Please provide a working stackblitz template, demonstrating the issue. Also I'd suggest using dataType=\"date\". Please use forum for questions and help requests.. Unable to replicate with 6.x, if issue persists please create a new issue ticket and provide a test case using link below;\nhttps://stackblitz.com/github/primefaces/primeng-issue-template\nThank you..

We use StackBlitz now as a replacement of plunkr.. This is fixed in recent releases.. How about ngOnChanges? Let's discuss this over an issue.. Tracked at 5441.

So we left it to the user, common workaround is using contentStyle with a max height so internally dialog content scrolls for big content and content size changes does not effect the position.. Renamed to ui-calendar-timeonly.. This causes an API inconsistency with Dialog which has onHide only. Why not set \"closable\" as false in your case to force confirmation..

This is a regression caused by trying to support iOS block scroll, more info at;\nhttps://medium.com/jsdownunder/locking-body-scroll-for-all-devices-22def9615177\nI'll just revert it as it causes more problems and keep iOS issue as open.. Provide a stackblitz template that demonstrates the problem first.. But this adds a new subfield property, why not use field: 'building.name' and use dot operator to define your field e.g. 'capacityCode.name'. Refer to ChartJS docs please.. This is expected and by design, user has closed the dialog so state has been reset. If there is more demand, we can reconsider.. If there is more demand, we'll reconsider, no plans at the moment. Thank you.. 6.1.2 works fine;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/calendar. Unable to accept a PR with 14 unrelated file changes.. Please use forum for support requests and questions, thank you.. Try the latest version please e.g. 6.1.2, worked fine for me.. Fixed in 6.1.3. Fixed now, thanks.. Not supported anymore.. Issue is too broad, please create per component level issues.. Provide stackblitz template with step by step instructions as I'm unable to replicate.. What is the version number you are referring to?. Invalid issue ticket. Please sure forum for questions.. And the bug is?. Sorry, I can't replicate any problem with current code. Please create an issue ticket with a stackblitz template to demonstrate the case. Thank you.. The issue is too general so please create per component level issues for the enhancements.. #6393. Please use forum for help requests. You need to use lazy loading.. Please use forum for help requests.. Rating is an input component so you need to use FormsModule or ReactiveFormsModule to set the value.. Thank you.. Will be reviewed in 7.0, thank you.. We're handling it different to make it an option where users can change the speed-easing of the animation, setting it to 0 disables it e.g.\ntransitionDuration=\"0\". Here is an example that will work with upcoming 6.1.4\nhtml\n<p-inputSwitch [(ngModel)]=\"checked\"></p-inputSwitch>\n```typescript\nimport {Component,ChangeDetectionStrategy,ChangeDetectorRef} from '@angular/core';\n@Component({\n    templateUrl: './inputswitchdemo.html',\n    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class InputSwitchDemo {\nchecked: boolean = false;\n\n constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}\n\nngOnInit() {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n        this.checked = true;\n        this.cd.markForCheck();\n    }, 2000);\n}\n\n}\n```. Range + TimePicker is generally not a supported combination at the moment.. Please use the theme forums, usually between 3-5 days, our team responds;\nhttps://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=22. Or set overflow visible on td element.. Fixed a couple of days ago, thank you.. PR merged, thank you.. Nice, thank you.. Not sure if using ChangeDetector directly here is the best way as it may cause unnecessary cd cycles as well, if there is more request with the same problem, we'll reconsider. We'll be monitoring 6448.. The change will write the value back which is not ideal, instead we need to use ChangeDetectorRef.. Should be fixed in upcoming PrimeNG 6.1.4, if not drop a comment please.. But suppose there is an open dropdown somewhere on the page, clicking row expand will prevent the dropdown panel to be closed. Instead custom events in the table should check if the event target is an expandable row toggler or not instead. If you can provide a stackblitz template, we can discuss further, please create a new issue ticket with the sample case.. Great, thank you.. If there is more demand, we'll go ahead.. If there is more demand, we'll reopen. Thank you.. Please make sure you have an up to date theme as well. Older themes have display: none at calendar popup. Since 6.0.2, overlays are implemented differently;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-6-0-2-released/. Please use forum for questions and support requests.. PR merged, thank you.. Thank you.. @yigitfindikli Please take over, this issue may expand to \"Angular Universal Support for all components\". Let's do it for 7.0.. I think this should be handled at universal side, we need to use events such as MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent. Following link has various workarounds at universal config.\nhttps://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts/issues/460. Thanks.. Unable to replicate, please provide a stackblitz template demonstrating your issue.. I'm sorry, new feature requests should be implemented by our team, we only accept defect fixes in PRs. Please create an enhancement request instead and we'll review.. Formatting is broken so will merge manually.. You're using deprecated themes, please use an up-to-date theme instead. Older themes are not maintained anymore so this is expected.. There is also closable property.. Modal value should be a number.. \n\n\n\n. SCSS requires Designer as these are created by the Designer.. Unable to replicate, please create a new issue ticket with a stackblitz template demonstrating the issue so that we can provide better assistance.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/d80364885deaec392e40c3d76fcbc7682c81a934. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/d80364885deaec392e40c3d76fcbc7682c81a934. primeng/primeng is deprecated, use the following instead please as stated at the documentation;\nimport {InputTextModule} from 'primeng/inputtext';. 7.0.0 should fix this one, the animation callback calls onClose regardless of how it is closed.. I'm sorry, new feature requests should be implemented by our team, we only accept defect fixes in PRs. Please create an enhancement request and we'll review.. It is not a valid usage, please keep your dialogs separate or try to use appendTo=\"body\".. Yes, inspired by your PR, I've done applies some changes to improve it.. You have full control over presentation;\n<td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n             {{rowData[col.field]}}\n            </td>\nInstead of using above, you can resolve multiple fields on your side, this is not Table related.. This PR causes regressions so closing.. We'll handle it differently, I don't think it makes sense to call onHide at ondestroy e.g. route change.. Will merge manually. This is by design, row select and checkbox select can't be used at the same time, it should either one of them. They implement different behaviors so should not be used together.. I can't replicate this, I've merged @JacobSiegle's PR although not sure if it is related. Provide a stackblitz template please.. I think it is better to use required property instead of ariaRequired. Please remove the lock json.. Fixed similarly, thanks.. Try a newer version please.. We've used our own implementation ported from PrimeReact but thanks.. Thanks, I seem some apis that we already have and not sure about the location, we'll do it on our side based on your PR. Thank you.. We'll do it on our side, thank you.. You seem to be using Omega theme which is deprecated, migrate to Nova please if you need the same look as in showcase.. Yes, I think it should not be moved off, we're checking this one out.. Seems there is a misunderstanding, frozenfooter is the counterpart of frozenheader, both get columns no data as data belongs to the body section. What you require from my understanding is a new feature such as frozenFooterRows, please create a new ticket for that which is possible for us to do.. I've also asked my colleague to revert the commit as it is better to handle it with frozenFooterRows instead of a new position property.. Expandable rows and frozen columns combination is not supported due to technical reasons.. Added manually. Growl is deprecated, please use Toast.. It is by design.. I'm worried about;\n@Input() set selection(val: any[]) {\n        this.selectedItems = val;\n        this.selectionChange.emit(this.selection);\n    }\nThis may cause an infinite loop, as angular will keep calling the setter. Will apply the PR manually with a change, thank you.. There are too many changes for us to merge. We'll implement it ourselves for the next release. Thank you.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6025. This blocks invoking and click listeners at document. E.g. open a dropdown, then click a checkbox, dropdown will stay open.. Growl is deprecated so not taking action, use Toast please.. Index of the row needs to be provided to the checkbox/radiobutton components so that they can be available at the onRowSelect or onRowUnselect events of the Table.\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-rowIndex=\"rowIndex\" let-columns=\"columns\">\n    <tr [pSelectableRow]=\"rowData\">\n        <td>\n            <p-tableCheckbox [value]=\"rowData\" [disabled]=\"rowData.year > 2010\" [index]=\"rowIndex\"></p-tableCheckbox>\n        </td>\n        <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n            {{rowData[col.field]}}\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</ng-template>. Looks like an issue on your side, you're managing the selected property however the logic causes two tabs with selected enabled. It should better be handled on your side instead of making TabView more complex. . 6520. We've a new implementation of autoresize which will be merged for 6.1.5.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6626. I was afraid that it may broke regular scrollable tables with no frozen columns but style does not get applied since I guess frozenWidth is undefined so works fine.. Decided to revert this case as should be handled by the page author instead where default values should not be overriden in a global confirm dialog.. We have plans to implement this differently such as displaying buttons like in PrimeFaces version;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/panel/tabView.xhtml\nSo in small screens, buttons get displayed to make the headers scrollable.. Please use forum for help requests and questions.. This may break some apps maybe not sure but it sounds right, if an app is broken it might reveal that the loading is not implemented properly at the app side. From the point of view of the table, I also agree that it does not make sense to slice a lazy table. Merged, let's see how it goes :). They are handled during animations at the moment which is the correct place right after change detection so dom is available. Due to this, not taking any action regarding this PR, thank you.. Please use forum for questions.. First of all there is no column toggler component, the demo just uses multiselect to implement column toggler sample. MultiSelect always adds new items to the end so this is expected, on your side you can implement it with an order by comparing the value with the options list.. Not sure if these two events are in demand at the moment so not taking action, if there is more user demand we'll reconsider, thank you.. Provide a stackblitz template please.. Growl is deprecated so not taking action.. Please use forum for help requests and questions.. Reviewed, looks good!. Please use forum for questions and help requests.. This is expected, browser do not trigger the necessary events such as mouseover as a result tooltip cannot be attached. You may wrap the input inside a div and attach the tooltip to this wrapper as a workaround.. SCSS is a premium feature and requires a subscription of PrimeNG Designer.\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/designer/primeng. Works for me as well, could be a related issue on your end regarding icons.. I think it is by design, we had request to make it so, I'll keep this issue open to receive more feedback. Maybe an option could be nice to make it customizable.. Let's not duplicate the API, messages already have life in their API.. Do you mean defaultLabel?. Merged, thank you.. We'll cover this one when we add built-in RTL support to all Table features, thank you.. I'll add onChipClick. Provide a test case please if you'd like this be looked at;\nhttps://stackblitz.com/github/primefaces/primeng-issue-template. @cuneytcalishkan That reminds me an old version, try PrimeNG 6.1.4 to give it a shot.. @fxvits, can you see it at showcase as well? . MultiSelect, the component used to implement column toggle demo passes index to its item template so you already have access to it in your item template.. But this would enforce a new property like index, which will break existing apps as it tries to sort based on index. Better to handle it on the app side since there is no built-in functionality like column toggler, it is just a demo.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6520. We rather not do this as we customize the snow to make sure it fits in the PrimeNG, changing it will break the unity.. Will merge manually, there is more stuff than we need like angular.json. primeng/primeng is deprecated so does not include new stuff like Toast.. Working on this now, seems like API has changed a lot so need to check what has changed. Also moment.js seems optional now which is a huge plus for smaller bundles!. Breaking changes are listed at;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Migration-Guide\nComplete List of Milestones with Changes\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/milestones?state=closed. Here is the initial version, we'll add more info about breaking changes as well so it will be maintained/updated from now on.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md. Renamed to header and subheader. Use forum for questions and support requests please, also a stackblitz template would help to replicate if you are sure this is a bug from our side.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1683. Carousel will be reimplemented so closing for now.. 7.0.0 should fix this one, the animation callback calls onClose regardless of how it is closed.. Changed to header and subheader. Not merging as we'll do a new Carousel.. Will cause performance issues so not merging.. Use forum for cases like please, make sure you have the compatible fullcalendar version, for example 4.0-alpha.2 is needed for PrimeNG 7.. PrimeNG 7.x requires Angular 7. Please always make sure major version of PrimeNG matches the major version of Angular like PrimeNG 6.x with Angular 6.x.. Provide a stackblitz template please;\nhttps://stackblitz.com/github/primefaces/primeng-issue-template. It is just for demo, there is no built-in row group in table as it can be implemented in different ways, rowGroupMetadata is an example, you can come up with something entirely different. In the demo, rowGroupMetadata should be updated at onSort for example to resolve your problem.. Unable to replicate, you need to update your typescript as well.. Provide a stackblitz template please, unable to replicate. Live demos seems to be fine;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/dropdown. At line 12 of index.html, using;\nReplacing this;\nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/primeng@6.0.0/resources/primeng.min.css\" />\nwith\nhtml\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/primeng@7.0.0-rc.2/resources/primeng.min.css\" />\nFixes it. . The merge causes positioning issues so reverted.. SplitButton position had issues after the merge;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/toolbar. This is expected, you may try removing overflow or set appendTo=\"body\" on dropdown.. PR may break some themes due to padding, I'll just replace to min-width and let themes define the padding.. You need to be on a page with PrimeNG components to see the difference between free themes.. No plans to change the current behavior, if there is more demand we'll reconsider making this an option.. Provide a stackblitz template please that demonstrate the issue.. Try with 6.1.7 please.. I'm unable to replicate with the code in master, please try with RC1 which will be released tomorrow.. Ivy is not production ready yet, we'll work on it once it is out.. Better to move it to totalRecords setter;\nset totalRecords(val:number) {\n        this._totalRecords = val;\n        this.updatePageLinks();\n        this.updatePaginatorState();\n    }. Why not, just need more community request to apply it. I'll keep it open for more votes.. You should be able to do this with the options property. Refer to chart.js config please.. @ktriek In future yes, we plan to utilize it more and more in other list components in 7.x. Will add manually. The merge causes positioning issues so reverted.. Yes, omega is one of the deprecated ones, please migrate to the newer ones like Nova.. What is the fix? Any pointers?. It seems you need to remove [disabled]=\"true\", I did not see this log in my test.. Is there stackblitz template we can review?. It works fine for me on 7.0.1;\n<p-dropdown [options]=\"categories\" optionLabel=\"value.color\">\n            <ng-template let-category pTemplate=\"item\">\n                <div [ngStyle]=\"{backgroundColor: category.value.color}\" class=\"l-item\">{{category.label}}</div>\n            </ng-template>\n        </p-dropdown>. Not PrimeNG related, avoid recreating options at the binding.. Unable to replicate with 7.0.0-beta.1.. There are onPage and onLazyLoad alternatives. Seems to be related to 6802. Issue is caused by using css of PrimeNG 6 with PrimeNG 7, following fixes the issue for example;\n. This is fixed on our side.. Fixed via PR. Please create an issue with details first.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6915. We'll reconsider if there are more requests, currently there is no significant demand.. We'll reconsider if there are more requests, currently there is no significant demand.. Reverted after a second though, if we provide custom content support, that will be easier.. Thank you for the PR, we'll do it on our side based on this due to amount of changes.. It would be better to figure out a solution that does not use timeouts.. Enhance;\n\nDataView\nDropdown\nMultiSelect\nOrderList\nPickList\nListBox\nDataTable. Fixed via PR. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/81659ccd24cb1a15dc66ed424ab4d5d5221164b1. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/f621479e419a282c5df099151e7e16f1f3ad1d77\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/bad58ce73a9b38b3cddf8d1d0d254930a8ebc895. You need to use Angular 7 with PrimeNG 7.. Send us a github project for review please, unable to replicate on our side.. MultiSelect Virtual Scrolling and p-VirtualScroller depends on @angular/cdk so it is not set to peerDependency to avoid issues like this.. Need to think more, only two components use it but when added a peer dependency, npm says cdk is required. Maybe we can just document it.. See https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6998. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/7001\n\nI'll push 7.0.2 to npm today.\nSeems like we had fullTemplateTypeCheck disabled on our side so missed it.. Can you try with 7.0.1 please.. Glad to hear.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/e850766a1736990b51d57192a2599bfbcdaa3b32. I'm unable to replicate with the latest PrimeNG. If the issue still persists with the new version please create a new issue with our stackblitz template.. We shall do it in PrimeNG 8.0.. We'll reconsider if there are more user requests to add this feature.. I'm unable to replicate the issues mentioned so rather not change anything on our side, there are no similar reports as well.. I'm unable to replicate the issues mentioned so rather not change anything on our side, there are no similar reports as well.. My colleague @yigitfindikli has already done it recently as well, thank you.. Merged manually. Better way would be I guess to use flex so browser can scale them properly without using props e.g. flex: 1 1 0. I'm unable to replicate with the latest PrimeNG. If the issue still persists with the new version please create a new issue with our stackblitz template.. Please use forum for questions and seek technical support.. I'm unable to replicate with the latest PrimeNG. If the issue still persists with the new version please create a new issue with our stackblitz template.. Fixed via PR. DialogService by design one Dialog so for nesting, inner components needs to have its own service injected.. Fixed now. Seems like a problem with chrome.. This is not called when item is selected with keyboard.. There is also onChange callback for this.. We'll reconsider if more users demand this behavior.. It breaks after a lightbox is closed and tried to reopen.. Menus are mostly for desktop e.g. menubar, the menus of premium templates (e.g. main menu of Ultima) have proper support for responsive design. Still we have plans to add enhancements in the near future to align them with the React versions. There are already issues about this.. I don't understand, onOptionClick is internal, what is to document? Where is wrong in docs?. 7030. We should not enforce the custom object to have a disabled property, disabled options are only supported when a SelectItem interface is provided. Better solution is to use optionDisabled property similar to optionLabel to get the disabled property name from the custom object.. DialogService by design one Dialog so for nesting, inner components needs to have its own service injected.. If more users demand it this behavior, we'll reconsider thank you.. Please use forum for questions and support requests.. Better to use your own element aligned with css next to the checkbox.. auto layering is removed in favor of modal dialogs as it was causing more problems than it solves. Modal dialogs solve this problem as well.. I guess it is easier to do;\n```typescript\n    hideOverlay() {\n        this.overlayVisible = false;\n    if (this.touchUI) {\n        this.disableModality();\n    }\n}\n\n```. Fixed via PR.. Nothing :). We disable it instead now.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/7170. Case is not clear, please provide a stackblitz demonstrating the case first.. This has been fixed before, thank you, your PR helped as well.. Merged manually, thanks.. If more users demand it via this ticket, we'll consider, thank you.. If more users demand it via the original ticket, we'll consider, thank you.. We'll consider if there is more demand, thank you.. This is expected, shift key is not supported in multiple pages as it is not intuitive. If more users demand it, we'll reconsider for sure.. Renamed to originalEvent due to convention.. We'll consider if there is more demand, thank you.. This doesn't check if a value already exists though, generally not sure about it, need more feedback.. Please use forum for questions and help requests.. 7030. Merged manually, thanks.. Thank you but a feature of this size should be implemented by the team internally. For example, I don't see any tests in the PR.. Renamed to onShow and onHide. Use forum for questions and help requests please.. Invalid report.. Thank you!. Since new upload uses HttpClient, I think you need to write an interceptor to do it; e.g.\nhttps://medium.com/@ryanchenkie_40935/angular-authentication-using-the-http-client-and-http-interceptors-2f9d1540eb8. Angular 8 is in beta so issue is not valid.. See controlClose feature for this.. Added manually, thank you.. Open source Bootstrap theme is not maintained anymore, you'd need Avalon Theme for bootstrap UI.. Please use forum for questions and help requests.. Use Toast please.. Not sure if we need a switch for responsive mode, still will update the docs to add ui-fluid. Thank you.. Not sure if we need a switch for responsive mode, still will update the docs to add ui-fluid. Thank you.. Invalid issue.. Not sure if we should do an empty array, maybe better to initialize it when needed if value is empty..

Might be npm installation process is different in Mac and windows?\n. There are no events like onBeforeHide or onAfterHide for dialog components. SheetJS looks good for excel format. Have you tried with PDFMake for PDF https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake.  It requires some analysis on PDFMake,PDFKit and SheetJS. Both PDF and excel are added to the PrimeNG Roadmap list. Otherwise i thought of working them under PrimeNG extensions :). Dialog supports appendTo=\"body\" type in latest releases.So we are closing this issue.Please comment out here for any concerns.. The width issue will be fixed with this PR https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1980 . The height issue need to be resolved.\n. But what is the use of open() event callback without having event information.. You can use native DOM events such as focus and blur callbacks. What would be the advantage with custom events. If I miss anything then please reopen or comment out here.. I'am not able to replicate the issue with latest PrimeNG 2.X/4.x release.It works fine with ngModel.Please try with latest versions.. The component is already available.So this issue can be closed.. It was added in later releases.. OutputText is a JSF tag which is not related to PrimeNG stuff at all.IMHO, textOnly or leaf attribute for breadcrumb specific component make sense.. Please try with latest Angular-CLI quick start project. It works without an issue.. It is good to change the subject to  generalized term \"keyboard navigation support to DataTable component\" or create a separate issue for other features such as sorting, filtering and so on.. Can you please elaborate your question. MenuBar will shrink based on view port size and that is the responsive nature of menubar.. I'am not able to replicate the issue.It works fine with PrimeNG 2.x releases.Please try with latest versions.\n<p-inputMask id=\"basic\" mask=\"99-999999\" name=\"simple\" [size]=\"50\" [maxlength]=\"9\"\n                         [(ngModel)]=\"simple\" placeholder=\"99-999999\">. @ejcastillo We don't have a feature like groupSeparator in inputmask component.Are you asking for a new enhancement or feature?. Not able to replicate the issue in latest versions. Please comment out for any concerns.. I think it reached EOS for few Premium templates like RIO. There are next generation layouts and templates available.Please check PrimeStore https://www.primefaces.org/store/\n@cagataycivici Correct me If i'am wrong.\n. Not sure why we need to make it center aligned.Is it something need for mobile site?. It was added long back.There is already showcase example too (https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable/editable. Please try with latest PrimeNG version. AccordionModule works perfectly.. The current version is displaying as per header values.So we are closing this issue.. 1. The customized property for expand/collapse fa icons make sense.\n2. This is purely use case specific feature. It is not a common requirement.You can use p-header to indicate changes in the content.. I'am not able to replicate the issue with PrimeNG 2.0.2 version.It formats properly for both string or number type input.\n<p-inputMask id=\"basic\" mask=\"(99)-999999\" name=\"simple\" [size]=\"50\" [maxlength]=\"9\"\n                         [(ngModel)]=\"simple\" placeholder=\"99-999999\">\nsimple: number=12345678;. In my opinion the whole point of using input mask is to force the user to enter certain characters at certain positions.You can use email mandatory characters for validations but the characters exist in static postion only.So dynamic email kind of masking won't suite for inputmask component .. Not able to replicate the issue. You can't get the focus to trigger any keyboard events. Please comment out or reopen if you still can replicate the issue.. The issue is because it requires SASS to CSS conversion.Either install SASS or node-sass to convert all theme CSS files.. The above syntax is proper to invoke full-calendar functions. Hence this is not the issue.. We can have style and styleClass attributes for MenuItem interface.. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2866. In my opinion, this is a good feature for TriStateCheckbox(exists without icon as symbol), Tree and TreeTable components instead.. I can't replicate the issue in current 4.x version. https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable/contextmenu. You can add currency symbols in the format but not thousand,decimal separators dynamically etc.. This one is available here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2880 . Thanks Cagatay. Got the point.It is working fine now.. Actually Inputmask is used to mask certain positions with certain characters. You want to port inputNumber features(https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/input/inputNumber.xhtml) in Inputmask  . The z-index should be dynamic for all overlay elements. I will raise a PR for this.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/2898. Yes,it is replicated for placeholder text-color.MS specific style class required to make it consistent with other browsers.. The showcase documentation import doesn't mean only for app module .It mentioned as what specific modules and classes need to be imported(for both component.ts,module.ts) to work with the component.. The issue is related to external charjs library.This has been fixed in 2.5.0 version and working good too.So we can close this issue now.. This issue is already fixed here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1539\n So closing the issue now.. I'am not able to replicate this issue.Which version you tried.Are you able to replicate the issue in showcase.. I can replicate the issue with PrimeNG 1.1.2 release as well.There is no issue with 1.1.1.Anybody can confirm on this.. I observed that even rowIndex displaying the first page results.Can you please confirm on this.. Duplicate #2157 . Is it specific to PrimeNG? The animations can be customized through Angular's animation package.Can you please explain what kind of animations you are doing.. You can check JHipster-PrimeNG module here \nhttps://github.com/sudheerj/generator-jhipster-primeng. Do you mean that we need to add titles for each button and that too can be customized with different properties. This issue might be because of hidden container issue.I can see this issue with customized steps wizard as well.\n\n. @Mrtcndkn Is it planned for 4.1 release or is it may get delayed. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2866. I'am not able to replicate on latest showcase version. So please try with latest PrimeNG version. Please comment out for any concerns.. Yes,SASS is available for all themes except bootstrap.But I'am not sure when it is going to be planned for bootstrap.. The description is not clear. Not sure what do you mean by show buttons similar to showSourceControls and showTargetControls. Do you want to control buttons which exists between source and target. I can't replicate the issue with latest local build.May be showcase build not having this fix.\n\n. Is it an issue with demo example or source code?. This can be replicated with custom filters only.If you use built-in filters then it won't cause this issue.The local component control values also need to be reset.\n. This is how I tried.\n1.Filter on 3 columns without using custom filter feature\n\n\nAfter clicking on reset button all filter inputs got cleared and the table displayed with initial records\n\n\n. This has been corrected in later releases.. You are right. It will center align the button when there is no text. I created PR for this.. Please look at this thread for necessary changes(The way messages updated and two-way binding) https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2634\nComment out for any concerns.. I can't replicate the issue.Can you please replicate the issue in showcase.. The menubar is responsive as attached in snapshot\n\n. This is not a bug. Please use forum for any questions.. Can you provide an example to replicate the issue.. You can use NoopAnimationModule to disable the animations.. As a question from my personal point of view, is GPL license won't be fullfilled for PrimeNG as open source project?. That is not the functionality of Slider component. i.e, It won't take random array values for sliding.. There are some plans or discussions on unit tests and e2e tests from PrimeNG Team as well. But there is no final conclusion or dates on this.. I can't replicate the issue. Please try with latest versions and comment here for any issue.. This is bit special case because chips will come under input component.The drag & drop support on input component is very rare.I think picklist is the better option but you can't provide input.. It makes sense to have cursor as pointer for home button.Even home button can be customized just like other menu items.. In the updated PrimeNG project it is not required to maintain DevDependencies separately. The similar issue is closed here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/967\nThere is already one github issue on building themes.. Can you please post Code with SSCCE.(both html and component files) . Closing the issue as it got fixed. Please comment out for any concerns.. I can't replicate the issue with latest PrimeNG 4RC release.You should provide some code snippets or try it out on showcase.. Can you please create simple plunker example instead of your github project(which has many other dependencies). Also can you please add step by step instructions to replicate.The above description is not bit clear.. The description is not clear. You need to provide step by step details on how to replicate the issue. Also please try with latest PrimeNG version. If you are still able to replicate the issue on latest versions then please create an issue with all the required details.. PR is already merged.Closing the issue now.. I can't replicate the issue.It works good in latest version. Please try on latest version. Currently the issue exists for TieredMenu only.. Yes, it was filed here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2763 . The child reference variable should be used instead item variable which doesn't exist.Shall I raise the PR?. The issue exists for TieredMenu only and it works good in panelMenu \nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2763\n. Not able to replicate the issue.Please try with latest 4.x versions.. I can't replicate the issue on desktop and mobile devices.It works fine on windows,macOS and iphone devices.Please provide more information.. @wl1leo If you are still able to find the issue then create a new issue with all the required details.This issue can be closed.. Is it the same issue with other themes as well or specific to Cruze theme. Okay.Thats great. I can't replicate the issue on showcase example with the latest version. Please comment on this if you still able to replicate the issue.. DataGrid is deprecated recently infavor of DataView component https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5255 . Can be closed?. The feature is already available.. +1 from my side. Also If we have more steps then it is good to have vertical alignment than horizontal.. This is not going to be complex thing.Normally only plain buttons will be used with severity.But this can be considered based on demand from user point of view :). Duplicate of #1318. Is it related to menubar or panelmenu? Please provide an example to replicate.. The example is corrected.. It was fixed here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2693\nPlease comment out for any futher issues.. The description is corrected.. This issue is not a valid one by without describing the issue exactly.It is good provide some description on expected result.. The typo is corrected in showcase.. The disabled functionality is available through readonly property in steps component.Better it can be changed to disabled attribute or provide control to the menu item instead.. I created a PR on this #2718 . I can replicate the issue on bootstrap theme.I will raise the PR now.\n\n. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/2658. The issue is not very much clear.Do you mean the selected row is unselected after adding the new record.Can you please make step by step approach with simple example.. The documentation is corrected with latest changes of PrimeNG column grouping feature. By default the unselection works by pressing metaKey.This can be changed by setting metaKeySelection=\"false\".So either you should use metaKey or set metaKeySelection=\"false\" in your case.\nPlease reopen if the issue is still need to be fixed.I will open another issue to update the docs as needed.\n. The attribute is mentioned in the attributes documentation section.. It was fixed here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2693\nPlease comment out for any concerns.. This issue is already fixed in previous PRs. Please comment out for any issues.. The paginatorPosition should respect only three values \"top\",\"bottom\" and \"both\"\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/2957. The new PR  is available here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/3087. There is first property to control the pagination.. The description is corrected.. I can able to replicate the issue.The same issue occurs on PrimeFaces calendar example too.This might issue with external dependencies too.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/1610. Okay. Let me check with the example of both calendar and schedule. . As mentioned before, this is as per design to improve the performance.. Please use forum for any questions and support.The issue tracker is only for reporting bugs or enhancements. Also provide the proper description next time.. That is how  TabView component should look like.It won't cover full header area when there are less headers.. I can't replicate the issue.It works fine for me.You can try to replicate on showcase example.. Instead of correcting 'readonly' to 'readOnly' attribute in the showcase documentation we can make changes in source code. i.e, The readonly attribute need to be consistent(Just like other component) by changing it as 'readonly' in the source code of editor.. Are you able to replicate the issue on showcase? It worked for me. Please provide plunker example.. The above issue is related to AM/PM format for time picker popup. This issue is not related to AM/PM display in input field(DatePicker and TimePicker).\nPlease create a separate issue with the details.. Actually we don't have any method such as removeTab in order to make an array can be refreshed or refilled. Can you create a simple example to replicate the issue.. Please check Chartjs  options on disabling tooltip flag.ChartModel provides options attribute to add all these configuration.. The PR looks good to me.But AFAIK I'am not sure how much it is going to be useful for users.. We need to cover two things in this issue\n\n\nDisable the step component through MenuItem's disable condition(First condition)\n\n\nThe active Index shouldn't be emitted when it disabled.So we need to put event emit statement after disable condition (Second condition)\n\n\nPlease let me know if it is not making sense. Duplicate of issue https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2663. You need to import modules such BrowserAnimations, footer etc. There are many errors in your app.You can find them using Developer tools.. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2564. This was announced at blog announcement, see good-bye doCheck at;\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-4-0-0-rc4-released/\nSo you need to create a new instance of array with spread operator or instead of push e.g.;\nprivate _showGrowl(params: Message) {\n    this.growlMsgs = this.growlMsg[...params];\n  }. The description is corrected.. You should mention property binding with square brackets in order to treat them as boolean values instead string values.\nSo it should be [closable]=\"true\". Cagatay only can update the PrimeNG issue template with the above mentioned animation package. I don't have access :). The same issue is already raised here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/921. Yes, you can do that. The below code snippet creates header for expander column. It works for me.\n<p-column expander=\"true\" header=\"Row Expansion\" [style]=\"{'width':'100px'}\" styleClass=\"col-icon\"></p-column>. I can replicate the issue.The onchange event is emitted on click of list, thats why the same item selection also causes the change event. . As mentioned in the last thread it is due to removal of DoCheck interface.Please do the changes as mentioned.. Yes, the slider dragging handle is not draggable.It works through click on slider bar. It should work on dragging similar to PrimeFaces slider.. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2866. The classes exists for outer container only. Are you expecting effect, effectDuration, easing and so on attributes. The issue is replicated. Please follow this issue status from this issue number https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2882. Sorry.I updated the issue number.Thanks.. Please don't create duplicate threads(2 times created). The issue is already available.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2208. It was fixed in a new commit.. I can't see font issue with showcase example of multiselect. Can you check there as well. The default label will be sharp after the active state.. There is onEditComplete callback which will be triggered through Enter key once the edit is completed\nPlease check events section https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable. I applied to inner DIV considering one user request on customizing background-color property. The background color won't be inherited to nested DIVs. Anyway it should be applied for outmost element only.The background-color customized  through additional properties.Thanks.. Have you tried with configuration in tsconfig.js\n\"lib\": [\"dom\",\"es6\"],\nYou can also check these threads for solutions or  workarounds\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2167\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1341\n. For all header checkbox you should have to use onHeaderCheckboxToggle event.. The issue need to be described properly with current behavior and expected behavior. If you are expecting row edit feature then there is already a feature request as below\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2208. Please read this blog on changes required https://www.primefaces.org/primeng-4-0-0-rc4-released/. Please use forum for any kind of questions. Also the issue didn't explain what kind of component used, no description and plunker example too.. I can't replicate the issue with showcase example. You might have defined dataTable in a different way. So please provide plunker example to replicate the issue.. You are right. Paginator should display only when there are more than one page. This is how it works in PrimeFaces. This is because you didn't define model or value for default multi checkbox behavior\nSo either you should set binary=true or define model\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/2870. Yeah, it won't depend on value setting. The PR will give clear distinction between single and multi checkbox. IMHO any other font-awesome icons won't suite for panel expansion and collapsed behavior. Anyway we can have icon(or toggleIcon) property similar to other components. #2869 \nIs it above PR resolves your issue?\n. There are many issues raised in tracker related to calendar AM/PM(speicific to dates, timepicker etc).Can you please create a new issue with the details. By the way, I can replicate the mentioned issue. . Yes, both properties must exist to customize a dialog position. AFAIK, this constraint is added because each element is posited based on Top,Left properties in the viewport.. Please provide all details including plunker example as mentioned in github issue template.Otherwise the issue is treated as invalid.. Please provide all details including plunker example as mentioned in github issue template.Otherwise the issue is treated as invalid.. Please edit your issue with all required fields such as description, expected behavior,current behavior and so on. Otherwise there is no clue to find what you are expecting.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2778. @ohadinho I can't replicate the issue. The value is reflected after button clear using both single and multiple features.. The similar issue is already raised. The onEditComplete should respond for tab, blur and enter events.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2535. Please read this issue fully for the required changes.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2634. @cagataycivici Now there is no issue. It is fixed along with other issues :). I created a new PR https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/3087. Correct. But AFAIK If the dialog is visible by default then it shouldn't emit visible change event. So I feel it shouldn't emit blindly based on show/hide. Closing this issue as duplicate.. PrimeNG showcase is based on angular CLI.I can't replicate the issue with PrimeNG showcase.. Please use forum for questions like this. You can use below snippets.It works well.\n[style]=\"{'border':'none'}\"\n. Please create a PR with the above changes.. The issue is replicated with lazy loading. The selection need to be reset with current page data during pagination.. The issue applies for paginator component as well. But it is good to create separate issue for paginator.. I can replicate the issue. The same issue applies for password and textarea components.. Please do some search\n  forum.primefaces.org. No, it will happen on left direction only. Normally non-frozen columns means high priority columns and always need to be visible in the screen. So it makes sense to have frozen columns in left side.\nAlso please use forum for questions.. @Mrtcndkn I observed that the reorder through drag and drop feature is rejected most of the time. Do you have any comments on this. It works without issues. But two things we need to consider.\n1. It should work with paginatorPosition values \"top\",\"bottom\" and \"both\" only.As of now it works with any paginatorPosition value. i.e, paginatorPosition=\"up\" or paginatorPosition=\"down\"\n2. If we add paginatorPosition=\"none\" to use external customized paginator then also it won't disable the existing paginator. Please try with latest PrimeNG version(4.x). If you still face issue then it can be reopened.. @ARandomDude Only when you want to use custom icon.\n@billfranklin You can discuss about dynamic issues in forum or separate thread.. +1 from my side. It has to be refactored across components. Good to work on these kind of breaking changes in major releases. . Showcase is already updated with details. You can find the example here \nhttps://github.com/sudheerj/primeng-4.1/blob/master/src/app/components/datatable/datatabledemo.component.html. That's great. You might have older versions.. Yes, I too can't replicate the issue. Please try with rimraf clean install.. The commit is partial.It should be same for both component.html and component.ts. In all the places(.html,.ts) we used it as clear. So let's use it as clear in all the places.. I can see the issue. So there should be a better color contrast for Ludvig, Redmond, lightTheme and so on.Thanks.. There are around 17 themes which gives more options for the users. Bootstrap CSS Framework is best in the industry but that shouldn't be the only option. There is bootstrap theme as well.The strategy is similar to PrimeFaces multi theme approach.\nPlease use forum for questions.. Please use forum for the questions. It is good provide an example also. Once it get discussed in the forum then you can raise a feature request.Thanks.. This one make sense to customize the icon. You can update PR with showcase documentation too. I mean property.. Please use forum for questions. This github tracker is specific to bugs or enhancements.Thanks.. Please use forum for questions.. @mahesh5b5  You can nest menu items as it demonstrated here https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/menu .It will give you the menu headers.. Hi Cagatay,\n          I can able to replicate the issue in showcase. \nGo to-->Schedule example-->select week view--> Click on non all-day(any time)\nThen we can find this error.\n@cagataycivici \n. Fixed for 5.1 release.. PR is created and available for the  review https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/4424. During development of our book, we developed wizard kind of component with the help of steps component https://www.npmjs.com/package/primeng-extensions-wizard. AFAIK, it supports only Toolbar module.\nhttp://quilljs.com/docs/modules/formula/\n@cagataycivici Is it editor supports other modules as well(Formula,keyboard,history and so on). Going to be available in the spreadsheet component \nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/786. I can't replicate the issue in PrimeNG showcase(IE and Chrome). But I can see the behavior in your thread. What is your screen resolution and dimensions.. You need to build the CSS if you are trying with showcase.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Building-From-Source\nOr else look into these setups\nhttps://github.com/ova2/angular-development-with-primeng. PrimeNG 4.3 is not released yet. Can you please your post with more details instead of just code snippets.. The description is quite not clear. Can you please explain bit further on expected behavior. The options property allows you for the customization. Is it not happening?\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/chart. That means you want to apply default multi sort oder. As of now it defaults to single sort order.. I can't replicate the issue with latest version of PrimeNG in showcase. . Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/3269. Are you talking about showcase? Did you build the CSS as mentioned in build from source wiki? Please use forums for questions.. Personally I didn't check these figures anytime. What about the difference in values if you don't use AOT. . This is not an issue. Please find the more details in forum link.Please continue the discussion in the forum https://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=52915. Glad to hear it works.. Can you please elaborate about expected behavior. Do you want to select through checkbox only(not through label)?. Can you provide the environment details(Angular, CLI and PrimeNG versions). It would be helpful to replicate the issue with plunker example.. The demo example is updated with data-binding property.. Sometime back, In some of the PrimeNG apps I tried with latest versions(2.5.1) which works perfectly with PrimeNG.. In my opinion, the sorting behavior on integers with currency is more use case specific. You can use sortFunction of column component to make customized sorting.. The issue description is not properly formatted. Can you provide the plunker example(which as integers with currency) as well.. Thanks for your comments and understanding. My explanation with above all comments is here.\n\n\nThe issue template format is not proper and difficult to read. For example, the proper format of issue should be like this https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4394\n\n\nThe numbers with currency column will give the meaning that numbers having different currency values($,euro, rupee, pound). For example, imagine salary with different currencies of a company, https://datatables.net/ . In that situation, Unless it supports by default, I prefer sortFunction due to currency symbols. In your case, the columns are just numbers with string type.\n\n\nChange  your quantity and price columns as number type instead String type. Sorting on string type will sort for each digit(for example, if you sort them as strings, 3 is greater than 29 because 3 > 2).\n\n\nthis.cars = [\n   {\"quantity\":1,\"item\":\"toaster\",\"price\":100.01},\n   {\"quantity\":2,\"item\":\"fan\",\"price\":200.00},\n   {\"quantity\":3,\"item\":\"ball\",\"price\":5.00},\n   {\"quantity\":5,\"item\":\"coat\",\"price\":23.05},\n   {\"quantity\":21,\"item\":\"drill\",\"price\":13.95},\n   {\"quantity\":221,\"item\":\"computer\",\"price\":53.25},\n   {\"quantity\":1,\"item\":\"shirt\",\"price\":3.00},\n   ];\nHope I answer your all your questions.\n. Please find my replies for your questions in detail\n\nI have set the code to the proper format you requested.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/l4JYVcfiyrl3qB88Ym0v?p=preview\n\nI asked you to format the issue(not the code) you created.\n\nSudheerj, The example you given me with datatables.net sort feature works out the box on all > > column examples, quantity, date, currency, name etc.\n\nThe specified sorting feature is working with number type only. That's why it is working nicely.\nI think if I'm able to set the column type in advance sorting could be done very easily then.\nIt is basic sorting only, not advance one.\nI looked through primeng documentation and I'm unable to see such documentation on the column type. If you can provide a working example it would be appreciated and I would be willing to close the issue.\n1.The typescript interface fields defined with type as here https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html.\n2.Converting string to number\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/34014342/convert-json-string-value-to-number\nThe example is available for dataTable sorting if you can clone showcase code.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/tree/master/src/app/showcase\nIn summary, this is not a PrimeNG specific issue.There won't be any type defined on component side. You need to change the type on your backend data.\n. In PrimeFaces, there was an exportFunction attribute for column tag to export customized data. May be similar property can be implemented here as well. But it is specific to export functionality and not include filtering support.. Can you elaborate the description with version details in a required format. Otherwise it will be treated as invalid issue.. As of now, the contextmenu toggles based on the click event anywhere in the document excepts the target button component.. @cagataycivici Sure. I will add the versions. There are some existing unescaped characters as well in the demo examples.. Are you expecting Chinese version for all component labels. As of now there is no chinese language pack.There is one request on Autocomplete component as well. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1318. Please use forum for the questions.. By default the table data will be wrapped. Since you are using scrollable table with different width columns the content is overlapped.\n\n. It can be either string or object type. It is not neither doc issue nor code issue.. Fixed,Thanks.. I can't replicate the issue in showcase. Can you please provide the plunker example.. Is it for finding the component or any keyword search?. Previously I observed this issue with last menu group(misc). Need to check once whether it cause any layout misalignments by removing the top property.. I can replicate the issue. It's an issue with multiple ng-content tags used in this place. Because  is for static projection but not for dynamic.\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9173. Okay, I can't replicate the issue now.. Not a bug.I can't replicate the issue. Either add the custom style classes in styles property or remove the custom styles assigned to it. Please comment  here to reopen the issue if you find any other concerns.. When I used basic steps component it is working for bootstrap as well. There are known issues with bootstrap theme and it planned for some changes.. The dropdownButton object is the view child of auto complete container. So it should be defined for dropdown options. I can't replicate the issue. So Can you please provide the plunker to replicate the issue.. I can't replicate the issue with latest PrimeNG 5.0 release. Please find the example here https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable/filter. It looks like that the PR includes other changes as well. Can you please recheck it.. In my opinion ng-template would be the right way to do for this kind of customization. If we concatenate the columns into single column then it will create an issue with all datatable features(filter,edit etc). I tried some of the font-awesome icons for custom icons and it works good. You shoudn't remove the prefix classes which creates the animation behavior.\nFew examples,\n```\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n```. Thanks for PR. It works fine.. PR https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/4509. The issue is not created in valid format. Can you describe further about the issue with plunker example.. What is the purpose of having BlockackableUI for toolbar. I never see these scenarios.However you can use BlockUi target as toolbar component . The blockUI support is added for Toolbar component in 5.0.3 release.. I don't think it make sense to have empty msg for Tree component. Any example tree demo available?. The filtermatchmode values doesn't support numeric comparison operators and it is clear from the doc as well. V6.1 guide is for PrimeFaces but not PrimeNG. . There is no separate guide apart from showcase documentation.. I think you forgot to include InputMask module.. There are style and styleclass attributes to apply customized width.. It is available as datatable component in PrimeNG library. You can raise a feature request for any new features.. You can use blockUI for dataTable component. Please use forum for questions.. You can't make it with style and styleClass attributes because they will be applied on container. The decision needs to be reviewed by seeing the behavior of steps component in the web. I didn't find this behavior in jquery based components etc.. Are you expecting that spinner should support customized icons apart from font-awesome icons?. The motivation or expected behavior is not clear. Can you please explain in detail further on current and expected behavior. Not able to replicate the issue on showcase. The second issue can be solved using style and styleClass properties of menuitem. Please create a plunker example if you still can able to replicate the issue. Closing for now.. Available in the next release.. Thanks, Updated.. Fixed.Thanks.. No, there is no component like that. I didn't find these kind of components in the web too.. Yes, you need to use external modules to extract the excel content and then prepare the data model for primeng table/grid. . You have not imported Message component. Please check the fileupload demo component.. The row editing is available in PrimeFaces datatable component. There is already feature request on this. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2048. By default metaKeySelection is true. That is we should use metaKey(ctrl or command) for selecton and unselection.\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable. @cagataycivici How to import Toast module for now in the latest release. It should be corrected. You can always get the example from showcase repo.. You can still pass default attributes for inputtext and inputGroup etc. Is it missing for any specific component? . ",
    "vmateixeira": "@cagataycivici \nThank you! I'm looking forward to it :)\n. ",
    "TekSiDoT": "I see several possible implementations:\n\n\n. Yep, that looks pretty sweet.\n. Will this feature be comparable to this table?\n. Fantastic, looking forward to it.\n. Confirmed, problem was cache related.\n. Perhaps attempt to unify it with editable cells:\nin case a cell is both selectable and editable, \n- edit when the inner text box is hit\n- select the cell when the space margins are hit\n- edit the cell when a selected cell is selected again\n. No, not quite. Using the first table you're refering to there would be a mechanism to switch editing for individual cells. This could be based on either cell content itself or on some auxiliary data structure. Each data row would have to supply the information whether a specific value inside that row should be editable or not.\nI realize this sounds complicated, but in the end it's an extension to the current format where table and column need the editable flag. The same would go for rows in *ngFor structures, possibly like this:\n<p-dataTable [(value)]=\"limitsData\" [editable]=\"true\" (onRowSelect)=\"handleRowSelect($event)\">\n<p-column *ngFor=\"#col of limitsCols\" [field]=\"col.field\" [header]=\"col.header\"  [editable]=\"col.editable\">\n        <template #col #car=\"rowData\">\n            <span [style.color]=\"car[col.field]\" [editable]=\"car[col.editable]\">{{car[col.field]}}</span>\n        </template></p-column>\n</p-dataTable>\n. Thanks, however, the error persists. I've switched off all custom CSS to make sure there's no interference.\n. I've traced the error to a dynamic setting that overwrote the static style=' ', my bad. Thanks for your help!\n. It does, however, still render below the bottom of the table, creating a vertical scroll bar instead:\n\n. It's non-scrollable, correct.\n. excellent, let me know if you need help reproducing\n. excellent, I manually excluded the respective css lines, this resolved the issue.\n. perfect, thank you!\n. This issue was opened a long time ago. If I'm not mistaken the input element is encapsulated inside the PrimeNG directive and does not relay these events to their parent components.. Further investigation led to a very basic cause of the problem: entries were save as string, not as object.\n. @httpdigest Would you be willing to open source your solution as an alternate datatable implementation?\n. I'd be happy to take a look and possibly adapt it, you could post a pull-request to my fork.\n. In my case, this error occured using Angular/Cli together with PrimeNG during karma unit tests. After a lot of fiddling I found that adding FormsModule within the respective tests enabled them to run properly:\nadd:\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nand:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    YourComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    InputSwitchModule, // Or whatever PrimeNG Module you're attempting to use\n    FormsModule\n  ]\n});. Any chance you can take a look at this? This is a requirement for using an ngrx/store approach with input elements inside the datatable. \n. Fixed via https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/19ca2a24895f24cb9e2eed04c2cb60906ca05ad0\n. Great find, thanks! I'll leave the issue open as a reminder to update the developer docs for now.. Rejected? Not reproducable? Fixed?. perfect, thank you!. ",
    "Glenndejaeger": "I prefer to have a label (= fixed tooltip) above the handle with the current selected value in it (cfr option 1 of slider scale) because if you use the slider within a small component (eg. search facets of 300px wide), the scale cannot be displayed, unless you only can select 3 values in range or so.\nIt would be great if both solutions (fixed scale + label above handle) would be implemented and users can select which solution they want to use via attributes on the component. I've logged an issue related to yearRange: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5476\nThe only way to make the user select a specific year in the popup is by setting yearRange. The problem is that when you manually enter a year outside of the range, it's not displayed in the popup (however ngModel is set correctly). - Make sure you imported the SliderModule in your angular module that contains the screens where p-slider component is used. Otherwise it won't work.

    "garethlewis": "Is there any update on when we can expect to get this component?  I'm currently using the angular2-color-picker from https://github.com/Alberplz/angular2-color-picker which doesn't work with Angular 2.0.1 onwards.\n. I had this problem earlier today when using Beta 9 of NGPrime.  If where you are using the p-dialog you have the old @angular/forms declarations, this is going to happen.  p-dialog uses the new Angular forms version 0.1.1 and when mixed with the old versions of Angular forms, causes this issue.  Update your forms to use the new formGroup object and it will work.\n. Not a problem.  It's the new forms api.  If you recreate a FormGroup and that is being used by a form in a dialog, angular forgets about it somehow.  This never affected the older forms as you replaced the current instance of the FormBuilder group.\n. Why don't you just use a viewchild for GMap and then add  the listeners yourself?\n. this.gmap.map.addListener(\"dragend\", function() {\n            console.log(\"dragend called\");\n        });\n. That isn't a bug with Prime, this is the Angular detection framework.  Your value of dialogInitialized  is changing.  When Angular is creating the component, it is using default value for dialogInitialized  in the ngIf statement.  The code in onAfterShow is then run and changes the value to true, the detection listener then looks again and realises that the values has changed, but it didn't change in a binding.  So it throws this as an error.  There are ways around it, one of the simplest is to put Angular into production mode and this check is not performed.\n. You need to reference this in your package.json if you are using rc.4 of Angular 2.\n\"@angular/forms\": \"0.2.0\",\n. You could do that yourself now.  Use a div such as\n\nThen use the ComponentResolver and ViewContainerRef functionality to dynamically load the component just before you show it.  I use this technique for editor panels as I don't know what the component will be until the user selects from a list or selects an object from GoogleMaps.\n. This isn't for dialog, but it will do exactly the same thing.\n<div id=\"customPanel\" class=\"right-panel\">\n    <div class=\"ui-grid ui-grid-pad ui-fluid\">\n        <!-- Dynamically load the list of objects here. -->\n        <div #objectListContainer></div>        \n        <!-- Dynamically load another component here. -->\n        <div #childContainer></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\nAdd the following import to your component.\nimport { Directive, Component, ComponentResolver, OnInit, OnDestroy, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef, AfterViewInit, NgZone } from \"@angular/core\";\nThen in your code you will need to declare view children to access the HTML.\n@ViewChild(\"objectListContainer\", { read: ViewContainerRef }) objectListContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n@ViewChild(\"childContainer\", { read: ViewContainerRef }) childContainer: ViewContainerRef;\nAlter your constructor to receive the services for ViewContainer and ComponentResolver.  Ignore the socketservice and tokenservice, that is something that I wrote.\nconstructor(private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, private componentResolver: ComponentResolver, private router: Router,\n        private route: ActivatedRoute, private tokenservice: TokenService, private socketservice: SocketService,\n        private domHandler: DomHandler, private ngZone: NgZone)\nThen when you decide to show the component, execute the following code.\nthis.componentResolver.resolveComponent(ObjectListComponent).then(cmpFactory => {\n            // this is needed otherwise you will start dropping mulitple copies of the component onto the display\n            this.objectListContainer.clear();\n            let cmpRef: any = this.objectListContainer.createComponent(cmpFactory);\n            cmpRef.instance.objects = this.objectList;\n});\nHope that helps.  Send me a message if you need more help.\n. That's not angular really, this is a byproduct of the datatable itself.  There are two methods defined.\nmouseenter and mouseleave, and these are being called when your mouse cursor enters any of the rows or columns.  This isn't new, this used to bog down JTable in Swing.\nThe problem you appear to have is mouseenter in the datatable and then the mouseenter or hover functions being called for every component in the row.\nI don't think the NGPrime team could actually optimise for that.\n. How are you going to enable and disable the css for the row you need?  CSS might speed it up, but you still need to decide which column or row the mouse has entered.\nI have never noticed an issue with Chrome.  I have with an older version of Edge, but since the latest version of 1607, not again.  Firefox on the other hand is treacle.\n. Not going to help, actually that is worse.  hover causes a reflow event in the brower, where the browser as to work out what has changed.  That's even worse than you setting the css yourself.\n. True, but just replacing everything with hover, doesn't solve anything.  Doing anything with CSS, like changing an attribute causes a reflow.\n. Blond moment, not a problem really.\n. If you have a reference to the underlying model that represents the data that the table shows, you can set a reference to the selected item to one of these items and the table will update itself.. Have you updated you main.ts or wherever you define the main entry point for your angular application?  This has changed significantly with RC.5.  If you follow the example in the showcase Github page, you should be able to adapt your app in a short period of time.  It took me about 30 minutes to alter everything.\n. Which version of Edge are you using?  I've got the version in the release 1511.\n. That is a newer version than I have.  I have 25.10586.0.0.  And our application uses dialogs and panels everywhere.\nLooking at the text you have displayed, that only occurs when the change detection throws an error.  It is stating that a variable you have asked it to look after with binding, has been changed, but the control didn't change it.  That will definitely not be true in this case.  Pressing either button causes the bound variable to change and the change detection is expecting that.\n. @AloeDream I'm on Angular 2.0 Final and I am using PrimeNG Beta 15 with no problems.  There should be warnings, as the packages Prime uses are earlier than the Angular 2 version referenced and the rxjs version will be newer, but it won't stop it working.\nIf your build tools are failing that, you've got a problem with your build tools.\n. @AloeDream I have Angular 2 Final and PrimeNG.  PrimeNG can be installed.\n. I have upgraded my project from RC.5 to the final release of 2.0.0, where final is used loosely by Google, and have not had any problems with those components.  They render fine.\nOut of interest, what browser are you using and what messages, if any do you get in the console output of the developer tools?\n. I think your problem lies with the angular2-seed project.  Angular 2 isn't the issue and I built my project from scratch.\n. You have two choices.  The first is to remove the async defer tags from Google Maps in the index.html file.  It will block your page until it has loaded, and then you won't have your problem.  The other way, which will still block and therefore isn't actually any better, but looks better as it contains code is to use a callback function from loading of the google maps api.  You will need to write a pure javascript function in index.html, which handles the callback from the google maps loading, and then this calls the SystemJS or Webpack bootstrap code.\n. I've just looked at the example in the showcase page in Edge, and that problem does not occur.\nAre you seeing this in the showcase, or have you built an application using the package from NPM?\n. You shouldn't try and limit this to only the dialog component.  Any component that Prime has that needs to dynamically change content based on a trigger should handle this situation.\nI just looked at the logger component on the page you linked and basically the prime guys could easily take that idea of a service that is injected into every component and just use it to update the display.  The two methods tick and tick_then just initiate a setTimeout for 0 ms and then run the code you passed in the lambda.\n. What output do you get in the console?  And do you have a valid key?\n. Okay, here is a very odd thing to try.  Use Ctrl + or - to change the viewport size of the webpage.  Does the map tile load?\n. And your index.html or whatever your landing page is called has the link to google maps?\n. Uhh, you just exposed your API key, unless you lock that down to your URL anyone can use that.\n. this.gmap.map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng(position.lat, position.lng));\n. You need to fire a resize event on the google maps object.  This is not something that prime handles.\nTo execute this, execute this line after your recenter command.\ngoogle.maps.event.trigger(this.gmap.map, \"resize\"); \nAs long as you don't resize the window, you won't need to create a window.onresize event handler, and the map should just redraw itself.\n. The problem you have is the Modal is part of your component, but its lifecycle isn't open to you.  So it will have a ngAfterInit and ngAfterViewChecked method which decides what to do. \nThe call to resize outside of the timeout, is essentially asking the map to recenter itself, before it has redrawn itself.  It doesn't like that.  Usually it just leads to lots of angry red messages appearing in the console about null.  The timeout is allowing the map canvas to display and then your call to setcenter will work.\nWhat is the reason for opening the map in a dialog?\n. Actually for what you are doing, if all you need to do is show where the doctor is and don't need interaction, this is a perfect problem for the Static Map API.\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/\nThis way, you don't even need to worry about loading google maps.  You just link to a URL that contains an image and Google create you an image upto 1024x768.\n. I'm using Angular 2.1.1 now.  What problems are you seeing?\n. How much experience do you have of Angular 2 at the moment?\n. Have you gone through the example project at Angular.IO?\n. Okay, you should pretty much understand what you need to do.\nYou're trying to create a table that is going to be bound to some data.\nSo your component or module needs to have an input an d then based upon that dynamically create the rows in the table.\nThat should actually be pretty easy to do.\nIf you look at the code for the basic version of the datatable that should give you an idea of what you need to do. \n. That's because there isn't a route called datatabletemplating,\nThe url is http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable/templating\n. You really need to talk to the Meteor guys, this is a generic issue.\n. You're probably going to need a viewchild reference. . You can just add that yourself.  It's exposed on the gmap object, you just use the API, you definitely don't need that as a data bound option.. What messages, if any do you get in the console?. ",

His beloved son ichael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. T hrough Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family.\n    \n\n        Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.\n    \n\n        After a break of more than  15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo returned to the well for this third and final story of the fictional Corleone crime family. Two decades have passed, and crime kingpin Michael Corleone, now divorced from his wife Kay has nearly succeeded in keeping his promise that his family would one day be completely legitimate.\n    \n\n\nActivate Tab 0\nActivate Tab 1\nActivate Tab 2\n\n```\nTS\n```\nonTabChange(event) {\n    this.msgs = [];\n    this.msgs.push({severity:'info', summary:'Tab Expanded', detail: 'Index: ' + event.index});\n    this.activateTab(event.index);\n}\nactivateTab(tabNumber) {\n    this.selectedTab = tabNumber;\n}\n```\n.

Please try with the latest PrimeNG version and comment if the issue still persists.. As @dzhavat told there ui-datatable-header class is for facets.In basic datatable there is no header so there is no ui-datatable-header class..

Please use forum for questions and support requests instead of issue tracker.. Thanks for explanation.. We fixed it for 1.1.2 but it's temporary.. There is nothing special for this but you can give it a fixed with.. Please try with the latest PrimeNG version and comment if the issue still persists.. Hi this issue is about container div's position.When position is relative and there is an datatable inside of that container this happening we are investigating.. Hi,\n1.1.4 released today for scroll and sorting is problem consisting or is it fixed?. Glad to hear that.. Thanks. It already has you can just use it like that. sass  --watch resources/ --sourcemap=none\nYou should use sass watcher for css files.\nTake a look at this:\nhttp://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html. You should add full calendar js and css to your cli.json\n\"styles\": [\n        \"../node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css\",\n        \"../node_modules/fullcalendar/dist/fullcalendar.min.css\",\n        \"../node_modules/quill/dist/quill.snow.css\",\n        \"styles.scss\"\n      ]\n\"scripts\": [\n          \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js\",\n          \"assets/layout/js/layout.js\",\n          \"assets/layout/js/ripple.js\",\n          \"assets/layout/js/nanoscroller.js\",\n          \"assets/layout/js/swipe.js\",\n          \"../node_modules/moment/moment.js\",\n          \"../node_modules/chart.js/dist/Chart.js\",\n          \"../node_modules/fullcalendar/dist/fullcalendar.js\",\n          \"../node_modules/quill/dist/quill.js\"\n      ]\nlike this..

Actually it's not a bug that's the way it works by design.. Okey we will review this behavior i will inform you guys from here. @Dekel-Cohen @roni-frantchi . Hi,\n<p-dialog [resizable]=\"false\" [(visible)]=\"display\" modal=\"modal\" width=\"300\" responsive=\"false\">\nYou should bind it.. Actually it's angular related but when a property set true by default you should bind it to false for becoming false.. It's about our datatable enhancements and new features.It's now fixed for RC2. Hi,\nHow can i replicate this problem locally it seems fine @MTechDE .. Still no lucks i updated my primeng version the latest and still locally no error about lightbox. There is an onBlur event on calendar which is exactly what you want i guess. @bomberblue07 \n. Hi,\nIt's fixed for RC2.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1866. In datatable.ts line 195 replace with this line\n<td [attr.colspan]=\"dt.visibleColumns().length\" class=\"ui-datatable-emptymessage\">{{dt.emptyMessage}}</td>\nIt will work for you till RC2.It will be ready in 1 week.. Can you upload a screenshot or sample code please.. With 2.0-RC.1 all themes have scss folder except bootstrap.. Hi,\nCould you please try to add positionStyle=\"fixed\" to tooltip applied element.. It seems normal is it working now?. Okey i will review that and get back to you.. What is your current PrimeNG version? @silver-486 @ar53n @herrstrom  I tried it with the latest versions of PrimeNG (4.1.0 RC2) and angular (4.2.3) and it's working is this issue still persists?. Could you please try it with latest versions?. If issue persists on the latest version of primeng 4.1.0-RC2 feel free to open the ticket again.. @DraghiciR You can check it from over here:\nhttp://primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable/filter. First you need to bind [options]=\"optionConfig\" configuration to your schedule like this\n<p-schedule [events]=\"events\" [header]=\"header\" [options]=\"optionConfig\" defaultDate=\"2017-02-01\" [eventLimit]=\"4\" [editable]=\"true\"\n                (onDayClick)=\"handleDayClick($event)\" (onEventClick)=\"handleEventClick($event)\"></p-schedule>\noptionConfig is a variable for the necessary configurations.\noptionConfig: any;\nInside ngOnInit function:\nngOnInit() {\n        this.optionConfig = {\n            isRTL: true\n        };\n    }\nYou can use options property like this.\n. Actually it's not impossible you can create your rows with templates and later you can set tooltips for that templates.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/3153. Where did you import the component? @eliavmaman . Hi,\nYou need to import these modules from app.modules.ts. Could you please try it with 4.1.0-RC2 @mikejchin ?. Autocomplete dropdown displays suggestions when you select a suggestion it's your value but when you reopen suggestion that item is only a suggestion so it's expected behaviour.. It's unclear please create your issue with the specifications.. Hi,\nI couldn't replicate this issue and your plunkr isn't working.\nhttp://pasteboard.co/whJ5d99Is.png. I did it exactly like you with your datatable still no lucks.\nhttp://pasteboard.co/wB8DZBkxH.png. Hi,\nAdd appendTo=\"body\" to your multi select.. Hi,\nYour post should involve 1 issue only you should open your issues separately.. This one is fixing this issue\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2037. We reviewed this and this is expected behaviour.. We reviewed this and this is expected behaviour.. We reviewed this and this is expected behaviour.. Hi,\nLocally it looks fine. \nPlease try this;\n <p-radioButton formControlName=\"time\" name=\"radio\" value=\"9AM ~ 12PM\" label=\"9AM to 12PM\"  ></p-radioButton>\n <p-radioButton formControlName=\"time\" name=\"radio\" value=\"10AM ~ 2PM\" label=\"10AM to 2PM\" ></p-radioButton>\n <p-radioButton formControlName=\"time\" name=\"radio\" value=\"1PM ~ 5PM\" label=\"1PM to 5PM\" ></p-radioButton>\n\nAdd name=\"radio\" to all buttons.\nIf bug consists please reopen the issue.. Hi,\nYou should bind disabled attribute\n[disabled]=\"false\". @sivanandanr  I tried this locally and it seems normal to me. See the screenshot below.\n\nhttps://pasteboard.co/2ecVlblWZ.png\nCould you please create a plunkr?\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/Wj39h1?p=preview\n. If issue persists on the latest version of primeng 4.1.0-RC2 please provide a plunkr so we can reopen the issue.. I tried it locally with the latest version of PrimeNG (4.1.0-RC2) and Angular (4.2.3) and it's working. @cagataycivici . It is for demo purposes if you are using the same code snippet from the live showcase and it's expected behavior.. There is onReorder method for orderlist when the order changed it will be invoked it can solve your problem.. Hi,\nWe reconsidered this and you are right about it.\nWith 4.0.RC1 you can easily close the feedback panel like this =>\n <input pPassword type=\"password\" [feedback]=\"false\"/>\n\nfeedback property is true by default for closing it you need to bind it like in the example.. I tried it locally and everything seems working fine try it like this.\n<p-autoComplete [(ngModel)]=\"country\" [suggestions]=\"filteredCountriesSingle\" (completeMethod)=\"filterCountrySingle($event)\" field=\"name\" [size]=\"30\"\n    placeholder=\"Countries\" [minLength]=\"1\" (onFocus)=\"test()\"></p-autoComplete>. Glad to hear that.. What version are you using? @unaor @MeMeMax . This change will be available after 4.0.RC1. After 4.0.RC1 it will work. If there are any problems afterward then feel free to reopen the issue.. There is no change in that version maybe you can try it with 2.0.0 final version @unaor . Hi,\n\nIf you are changing your data not your array just data inside of it then you should use refresh manually. But if you are changing your array then after 4.0.RC1 changeDetection will work automatically without any function call.. We will add color option classes to splitbutton like in the regular buttons.After that you can change that class to give your own color.. @cagataycivici @xuanshenbo It's in progress.. Glad to hear that.. Can you create a plunkr or share some code according to your issue?. It is now fixed for 4.0.0-Final.. CodeHiglighter is for highlighting the code snippets. In our showcase we use codehighlighter for every documentation. You can't highlight a component with it.. 3 new attribute added to multiselect component for this issue. After 4.0.0-Final multiselect component will have displaySelectedLabel attribute for deciding to show the defaultLabel or with new maxItems attribute.maxItems attribute have a default value of 3. After 3 selections container displays a message like \"4 items selected\". And you can specify your own message for this with new selectedItemsLabel attribute which is by default have a value of \"{0} items selected\". @Helayxa @codechamploo \n. Hi,\nYou should bind that attribute to the component like this\n <p-checkbox  binary=\"true\" [disabled]=\"true\"></p-checkbox>\n <p-checkbox  binary=\"true\" [disabled]=\"false\"></p-checkbox>. It is fixed after 2.0.3 you need to upgrade your PrimeNG version.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/2579. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/36f406d571d8f59771f14b59044115ae3d01c14c.     <p-multiSelect [options]=\"cars\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCars\" maxSelectedLabels=\"5\"></p-multiSelect>\n\n@GayathriMohan . Glad to hear that.. What is your primeng version? @aelsrana . Could you please create a plunkr about it because i can't replicate it with the latest version\nRegards. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/36f406d571d8f59771f14b59044115ae3d01c14c. Try with ng-template instead of template.. Recently tempalte syntax changed the first thing i saw before doing anything is that you are using the old one.\nThis one is old one\n<template>\n\nThis one is new one\n<ng-template>\n\n. http://pasteboard.co/2dcmchjgs.png. Your growl component should look like this with life attribute;\n<p-growl [value]=\"msgs\" life=\"10000\"></p-growl>\n\nI'm guessing you are trying to use life attribute like this;\n<p-growl [value]=\"msgs\" sticky=\"sticky\" life=\"10000\"></p-growl>\n\nYou need to remove the sticky attribute because it's disabling the life attribute.\nIf your problem still insists after these instruction feel free to open this issue again.\n@SpiderPork @bogacg . Could you please share your service that creating your growlMsgs?. In 4.0.0-RC5 we are now supporting immutable objects which means your original array should stay put and you need to do your changes on a shallow copy of it for handling the changes.\nYou can check this commit;\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/cc9b483ddab4c1ce125ccf07aa9628bed921398e. We are working on this issue at the moment.. On our live demo there is source section we are using growl as sticky on our demo.\nLike this;\n<p-growl [value]=\"msgs\" sticky=\"sticky\"></p-growl>. The problem here is that sort and filter function requires a field attribute for their functionality. And that field should match with your data at the first place. For example\n\n<p-column field=\"advertName\" header=\"Advert Name\" rowspan=\"2\" [filter]=\"true\" filterPlaceholder=\"Search\"\n                  filterMatchMode=\"contains\"></p-column>\n<p-column field=\"advertName\" header=\"Advert Name\" rowspan=\"2\" [sortable]=\"true></p-column>\n\nBoth of these will work inside a headerColumnGroup in your plunkr you don't have any fields on your columns which is inside of the headerColumnGroup's.\nTry these out please if the issue will persist feel free to open this ticket anytime.\n@panakour @mpulido73 \n. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/30dada7d5f7454bc2c6878573310578ad4be408d.

What is your PrimeNG version because this plunkr works with PrimeNG 4.1.0 RC2 maybe your PrimeNG version is old ?. Let me now if your problem is solved after upgrading.. Great glad to hear that.. @ova2 Great glad to hear that :) Release will be in next week.. Hi,\nI think the problem is not about appendTo and filter options used together. When you use filter=\"false\" without binding false is just a string for the template so it rendered as true you should use one way binding [filter]=\"false\".\nIf issue persists after this feel free to open the ticket again.. Hi,\nThe plunkr you created is not working. I tried your steps locally and I couldn't replicate the problem.

It works normally in my local could you please create a plunkr.. Enabling both selectionMode for p-datatable and p-column causes the issue.. It is working great. Ready for next release.. Could you please create a plunkr I am unable to replicate it.. I tried your plunkr and it is working as expected.\nhttps://pasteboard.co/Gzej9w8.png. Older version of firefox right? Because if it is about 4.1.0-RC3 that should be fixed. It is fixed for 4.1.1. Duplicate of #3041 and it is fixed with RC3.. Sorry for misunderstanding could you please create a plunkr because I am unable to replicate at the moment.. I will try the plunkr meanwhile please track the issue from here #3277. Sure you can create a PR about this after the review we can merge it. @battmanz . You can unselect a node simply using the metakey.  @steve3d . That is by design if any other request come about this context we will conside but for now. Metakey for mac is cmd and for windows ctrl..

Looks great.  \n@ZIOLele - Any plans to submit a pull request to add this functionality?\n. @ZIOLele - I am going to incorporate similar changes directly into the tree component and submit a merge request.  Started making my changes here: \nhttps://github.com/JakeSummers/primeng/tree/tree-addExpandApi\nWill submit a merge request when they are completed.\n. I think that this may now be possible with PrimeNG 1.0.0-beta.13.  \nThis release allows you to provide a template to render your nodes like this (using @ContentChildren):\n<p-tree\n    [value]=\"...\">\n    <div>some content</div> \n</p-tree>\nI think that it may be possible to add a primeNg drag handle inside the ContentChildren.  Haven't tried this yet, but I think this should work.\n. Hi @cyberrranger ,\nUntil this functionality is added into primeNg you can workaround by using something like this:\n```\n<p-tree\n    [value]=\"displayedRootNodes\"\n    selectionMode=\"single\"\n    [selection]=\"selection\"\n\n<template let-node pTemplate type=\"default\">\n    <span\n        pDraggable=\"treedragdrop\"\n        pDroppable=\"treedragdrop\"\n        (onDragStart)=\"onDragStart($event, node)\"\n        (onDragEnd)=\"onDragEnd($event, node)\"\n        (onDrop)=\"onDrop($event, node)\"\n        (onDragEnter)=\"onDragEnter($event, node)\"\n        (onDragLeave)=\"onDragLeave($event, node)\"\n\n        {{node.label}}\n    </span>\n</template>\n\n\n```\n\nJake\n. I think that this was addressed in PrimeNG 1.0.0-beta.13\n. I suspect that this issue may be caused by the changes to use @NgModule.\nSee:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1isijHlib4fnukj-UxX5X1eWdUar6UkiGKPDFlOuNy1U/pub\n. Fixed this issue two weeks ago but made a lot of changes and didn't ever pinpoint exactly what the issue was.  Going to close this issue.\n. This should resolve issue #261.\nAdditionally it should make implementing #682 very easy, either directly in your app or in the PrimeNg codebase.\n.

Any timeline on when this should be done 'review'?\n. > Just reviewed, one question what is the reason for following methods;\n\n\nexpandToNode\nfindPathToNode\nfindPathToNodeRecursive\n\n\nThe Tree.expandToNode method isn't required, but it allows you to expand the entire tree to a specific node.  \nSuppose that you have a tree like this: \nRootNode\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 Lunch\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drinks\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500 OrangeJuice\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Coffee\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Food\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Eggs\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Bacon\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Toast\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dinner\n  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drinks\n  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Food\nNow suppose that you add cream to your coffee: \nRootNode\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 Lunch\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drinks\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502    \u251c\u2500\u2500 OrangeJuice\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Coffee\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502             \u2514\u2500\u2500 Cream\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Food\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Eggs\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Bacon\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Toast\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dinner\n  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Drinks\n  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Food\nfoodTree.expandToNode(creamNode) allows us to easily expand the tree to show the new node.  Without this we need to find every node that is an ancestor of the creamNode and run node.expanded = true.\nfindPathToNodeRecursive is used by expandToNode.  It is a private method and not part of the API.  I created findPathToNode because I thought that it could be a useful utility for other people, however I am fine with removing it.\n. @cagataycivici - Should be good to go.

Great.  \nI think now there are two options...\n- Build the primeNg package as part of my project\n- (or the better option) Add a prepublish hook into the package.json of primeNg.\nI would still be very interested to see how the PrimeFaces team is publishing this.  \nThis is a pretty good article (relating to babble) on how to publish an npm module\n. +1 - This is awesome!\n. What is the benefit of using this instead of ngif inside the template?\n. Thanks\n. Agreed, contributing to PrimeNg is tricky and every release the steps for building it are different.  \nCheckout my readme here for my (possibly outdated) steps to build the project: https://github.com/JakeSummers/primeng/tree/updatedReadme\nAdditionally, figuring out how to use a forked copy of PrimeNg is tricky.  I wasn't able to figure out how to use my fork of PrimeNg because the prepublish steps aren't in this repository.  Posted a question about it here: \nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/818\nand here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/39237953/how-to-point-my-package-json-at-my-fork-of-primeng\nGood luck\n. Agreed.  This is really tricky to do.  I don't think this is an issue if you use the instructions here:\nhttps://github.com/JakeSummers/primeng/tree/updatedReadme\nAdditionally, I was having trouble using my PrimeNg fork in my project, so I logged a issue #818.\n. Flagging @cagataycivici - if I submit a pull request on Friday Oct 21, can you merge it in before next Wednesday?\n. Profiling info\nI created two CPU profiles using the chrome profiler.  During each, I ran the profiler for 45 seconds while moving the mouse over the app to trigger change detection.  \nIn the first test, the tree contained 500 items and completing one change detection iteration took up to 100ms:\n\nWhen the tree contains only 15 items completing one change detection iteration was much much faster.  It typically took around 8ms, however you can see that there are long stretches of idle time between the change detection cycles:\n\n. Thanks for the response.  Moved onto a new project so won't have time to do a PR for this.  \nFor anyone else with similar issues, I hacked my TreeNode to do the following:\n```\nexport class JakeTreeNode implements TreeNode {\n...\n\nget children(): FolderTreeNode[] {\n    if(!this.expanded){\n        return [];\n    }\n    return this._children;\n}\n\n}\n```\nThere are some other usecases, that you have to handle.  For example, when the selected node is collapsed, you may want to reset the selection since the Tree will no longer have the selected node.  This seems like an invalid state.\n. Hi @jisqaqov,\nThere already is an expandToNode method on the tree called expandToNode see here:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/tree/tree.ts#L292\nJake\n. Hi @jisqaqov,\nThere already is an expandToNode method on the tree called expandToNode see here:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/tree/tree.ts#L292\nYou can add checkbox selection using the tree's template feature\nJake\n.

It seems it could be related to this issue: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2380. +1. +1. +1. @sourabh8003, so technically there is no DOM element of this inner component when a dialog is closed, but it always lives in a components tree. It means if I have some component with a form inside the dialog, I can't set up the form in ngOnInit hook, I have to manually recreate(reset) the form when p-dialog has been opened/closed. Is it really an expected behavior?. It sounds weird to me when the DOM element of the component is removed, but the component by itself still lives in a components tree. That's a quote from https://www.primefaces.org/primeng-6-0-2-released/\n\nWith 6.0.2, overlays fully utilize modern Angular animations API in a lazy manner meaning they do not exist in the DOM and only get created when they are needed such as on user click, similarly they get destroyed altogether instead of hidden with css. This improves the performance of the pages having many components with overlays significantly. In addition, a new common animation is applied to all overlay components for a unified user experience.\n\nI've extended and overridden the previous version of p-dialog, so I removed the container of the dialog after animation is finished. That's what I expected in 6.02, I haven't seen 6.02 sources so far. But it seems I have to do the same by my own again.. @sourabh8003 thanks for helping, but that's not the issue here at all. I know how to reset the form \ud83d\ude09 \nAre you an author of PrimeNG? \nFrom my perspective, we have to destroy(according to Angular lifecycle) all content inside the overlay, but now we just remove a DOM element without destroying from Angular component tree.\nIf an author thinks in a different way, please, just close the issue. .

You were only doing one way. \nIn the source code of growl.ts, the remove method, that handles the manual removal of the message from the value array is causing the issue.

This should return the correct Message object. . A pull request has been entered to fix this.. @Nielsb85 In the Plunkr you have the following code:\nhtml\n   <p-autoComplete    (select)=\"add($event)\"\n                    [(ngModel)]=\"selected\" field=\"value\" [suggestions]=\"searchResults\"\n                    (completeMethod)=\"searchItems($event)\">\n    </p-autoComplete>\nHowever the binding to the event is (onSelect)=\"...\" not (select)=\"...\". \nThe use of (select)=\"...\" in Chrome works but Safari might be more selective..

In most cases, Messages and Growl both have different uses. However the Messages component not having a 'timeout' is rather unfortunate.\n@cagataycivici Is this something that could be implemented? Or are you open for the creation of a pull request for this feature?. @allarth Just an FYI. Your link above does not work. Its a valid address, however when copy-pasted it does not go to that address.. It is performing the same way even in the demo.

That would work if I was using [(ngModel)].\nThis should honestly work similarly to how Angular Material does its change() event.\nAngular Material Radio.

It returns 0 everytime and that's why the \"if\" to reinit the chart doesn't get executed. \nEDIT2:  The problem I got is that when I change the datasets[x].data, it does not get detected by the changes-variable in chart.ts. When I set changes to \"this.differs.diff(this.data.datasets[0].data)\", it works just fine.\nSo changes on \"this.datasets\" do not get detected by the iterablediffer. \nI then tried setting a variable to the current state of the datatable ( var current= this.data.datasets[0]), used shift() on \"this.data.dataset\" and then used push(current) to make it get detected. \nThat doesn't work either. \nI'm actually not sure anymore if this really is a PrimeNG-bug or some issue of Angular2. However, I'm not using the latest version of Angular2, so I don't know if this has been fixed already (or if it is an angular-bug anyways).\nI even tried setting a \"updated\" timestamp to my dataset and changed it everytime I changed the \"data.dataset[0].data\", but that does not get detected either.  Seems like IterableDiffers have Issues with detecting changes on array properties. \nChanges DO get detected if you JUST push(xxx) into this.data.datasets. Creating a new dataset does make it get detected by the differ. BUT: Using a shift straight afterwards makes the differ NOT detecting it anymore. Seems like if the array.length before and after using methods on the array has the same value, changes do NOT get detected. \nHowever, I might have made mistakes, since I'm not an experienced programmer in any way.

    "bomberblue07": "Y'know, the fact you have to import Chart.js isn't really mentioned on the showcase.... This would be great to have. +1. I'd like this exact feature as well. Exporting dates to CSV is not human readable by default. . With 4.0.1 letting filters apply to CSV export, adding this would still be awesome. CSV export applying to filtered data would be a great feature. +1. Okay, so if we've figured out how to do it, how come the devs have yet to bin this for release? @ajlviv maybe submit a PR with your changes?. I have this same issue. Odd that there's no acknowledgement from the devs about this. Still see this in RC 7. Can you please work on #1150 while you're at it, too?. I don't have a custom search on any of my fields, but I did have this error on 4.0.3- when I paged my table, the table display wouldn't update. Adding sortMode=\"multiple\" (without the square brackets) to my table made it work properly. I have no idea why, though.. Thanks @MayerMar , that did it for me.. @Arsenal83 After you're done manipulating the array, you just need to change the array reference by rebuilding the array: this.myArray = [...this.myArray]; This will trigger the change detection in the data table.\nIf all you're doing it appending to an array, this is the preferred way this.myArray = [...this.myArray, newElement];\nThat should be it. It's additional work on our end, but the tables do seem to be more performant this way.. @Neutrino-Sunset Firstly, I am not a contributor or owner of this project, just a user; so if you have concerns, I'm not the person you should be throwing shade at \ud83d\ude03  Secondly, if you want your tables to use the \"old\" method because they might be more performant for your project, set the immutable property to false\nFurther reading on this: https://www.primefaces.org/primeng-4-1-0-rc3-released/ See section on \"Immutable vs Mutable\"\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable See section on \"Change Detection\"\n. Hi @johnhwright it sounds like you have a similar issue to me, #2689 The issue is due to PrimeNG changing their change detection for datatables in RC.4 onward. Hope that helps!. I have this issue as well. @jgrant95 Try adding appendTo=\"body\" to your p-dropdown in your table. That ended up working for me. @alokkarma removing responsive = true from the table does not fix the problem for me, but removing that and resizableColumns did. Unfortunately, having resizable columns is a requirement for my application so I guess I'll just have to wait until this issue is fixed and just use a vanilla text filter.. @Helayxa That seems to work! I'm going to keep this issue open just in case the developers didn't intend for that to be the solution for something like this. Seems like the devs don't care and find this issue's solution acceptable. Closing.. Still doesn't execute the request in 4.2.0. Still seeing this in the latest version. It seems to happen on the JSON MIME type as well. @sgentile I forgot you can also limit by file extension with accept, not just MIME types, thank you. Doing just that works for me! Closing.. I did this myself by adding a [columns] to my table and specifying my columns dynamically in the template, but it references a static array in the component. This post in the PrimeNG forums provided a good basis example: \nhttps://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=54420. You can see it in the showcase on Firefox, too: https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/colresize. Still a problem in 5.2.4. Still a problem in 5.2.5. As of 6.1.0, the only free themes that will be supported going forward are the Nova family of themes; so try to use one of them in your app.. This is still an issue despite some of the style changes in 6.1.2. If you create a p-table with a [rowsPerPageOptions] and a summary template, you can definitely see what I see. The bottom of the dropdown spills over a bit into the summary.. This is still an issue in 6.1.4. I have a screenshot of what I'm seeing. Until this is fixed, I don't feel right pushing out PrimeNG 6.1+ onto our users\n\n. I still see this in 7.0.0-rc.1. Change the theme from the deprecated bootstrap theme to the new nova-light in your angular.json and you should be good . This issue persists in 7.0 and would help my users greatly if fixed please!. Upgrading from 7.0.0 to 7.1.0 caused the buttons in my p-fileUpload to be styled strangely as well. Thanks to @yasstou 's comment above, I was able to fix it by overriding PrimeNG's CSS with this rule:\n[type=button], [type=reset], [type=submit], button {\n    -webkit-appearance: none !important;\n}.

We can even get rid of this and only toggle router-link-active class in parent li only.\nUPDATE: I think my issue is different from this, here is a plunker forked from above demonstrating the issue. I am able to reproduce this without guards also:\nUPDATE 2: I think this is fixed by this fix.

I had to fix it for now by doing:\n<button pButton \n          type=\"button\" \n          class=\"ui-button-secondary\" \n          icon=\"fa-history\" \n          iconPos=\"left\" \n          [label]=\"(revisionNumber | async) || true\"></button>. This calculation is only done in ngAfterViewInit() of ScrollableView and never updated again. Also, there is no unfrozenWidth anymore to handle it ourselves.\nFor me I have frozenWidth as a combined Observable stream of a custom calculation (for fit-to-content columns) and window resize event. So whenever it changes, I am making a hack to do the calculation.\n```\nsetUnfrozenWidth(frozenWidth: number): void {\n    const el  = this.dataTable ? this.dataTable.el.nativeElement: null;\n    if(el && el.querySelector('.ui-table-unfrozen-view')) {\n      if(frozenWidth > 0) {\n        el.querySelector('.ui-table-unfrozen-view').style.width = calc(100% - ${frozenWidth}px);\n        el.querySelector('.ui-table-unfrozen-view').style.left = ${frozenWidth}px;\n      } else {\n        el.querySelector('.ui-table-unfrozen-view').style.position = static;\n        el.querySelector('.ui-table-frozen-view').style.display = none;\n  }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThe else condition is doing some style changes to accommodate frozenColumns = [] and frozenWidth=0px. I have configurable columns and there can be cases where none are set to frozen.\n```\n    this.windowResizeObserver = Observable.fromEvent(window, 'resize').startWith(null);\nconst unfrozen = Observable.combineLatest(frozenWidth, this.windowResizeObserver)\n  .map(x => x[0])\n  .do(frozenWidth => this.setUnfrozenWidth(frozenWidth));\n\n this.unfrozenSubscription = unfrozen.subscribe();\n\n```\nIt will be nice to have changes to frozenWidth to update the UI automatically. .

Sorry, this was a workaround for a previous version issue in my own css :/\n. nevermind, the moment api can take care of this\n. Looks like the angular maxlength validator is kicking in when this attribute is present. Probably it should be renamed back to the camleCased 'maxLength'.\nI get this issue on the autoComplete component\n. There is an existing workaround that should probably be documented.\nBind the ngModel attribute to a string (using [ngModel], not [(ngModel)].\nUse an object array for suggestions.\nIn the onComplete event handler, take your object instance and set the ngModel-bound  string to the value of your choice.. you can still create an array of SelectItem if you want to use any arbitrary value/label pairs, this is covered in the docs. You can extend the SelectItem inteface if you need more information to display the item options in the template.. you should see a close button below the comment area. I expect to receive a LazyLoadEvent on sorting, so that I can fetch the page records from backend.\nIm not sure how the sortFunction should behave with lazy loading, and it sounds to me it should not be allowed. My interpretation of the documentation is that it is intended to use when you have all records (no lazy loading) but need a custom sorting algorithm... yep i use with moment it works fine. Most probably a chart.js misconfiguration.. You can work around it by calling setTimeout() before overwriting the value, or by injecting the changeDetector and trigger it manually.\nThis is because you change the value when the value changed, creating an endless loop. Angular should warn you about this in dev mode.. Im concerned with this one and the children one. Why would the parent node be of the same type?\nCan't we have a TreeNode<MyFile> as a child of a TreeNode<MyFolder>?\nHaving the parent/child node types in the generic signature is probably cumbersome, so maybe it should be left as any. Or maybe add the parent/child type in the generic signature, defaulting to the node item:\nTreeNode<T = any, P = T, C = T>.. Ok. I was afraid that implementing this interface with different types would not compile, but it seems to compile just fine. Something like\nclass MyNodeA implements TreeNode { value: string; children: MyNodeB[]; /**...**/}\nclass MyNodeB implements TreeNode { value: number; children: MyNodeB[]; /**...**/}. this will fire the event twice has both method above will fire it already. \n",

    "fernandocode": "Much appreciated this feature. +1\nI would like to leave some implementation suggestions:\n- Create a template option to filter, similar to what is already there for the columns of the DataTable and allow your events are intercepted and processed by custom listeners, which can be set up any type of filter that may be necessary, in addition to those already mentioned (dropdown, calendar), for example, between (two inputs), bool (checkbox), etc.\n- Allow the object that keeps the DataTable filters can be manipulated by filters outside the DataTable, for example, you have a filter field to a value that is not present in the columns of the DataTable (Example: checkbox active item).\n. Possibly this other issue: #98, already covers this issue, it was not currently implemented by a bug in the angular that has not been fixed yet.\n. For PDF has this framework: http://pdfkit.org/\nThat in some tests seemed to be very pleasant to use.. Analyzing the current comparative code version I'm using [PrimeNG 1.0.0-beta.20], is the line 301 of this commit solves already my issue? Since we have this line (line 45) that selects the item that is in the variable currentMonth.\n. @chpasha , when I posted's issue had not yet rc.1 release, now there rc.3, I think this releace candidate is not very stable ... hehe. Three versions published in just one day. = D\nLater I will update my project to rc.3 and test this situation, if it is already resolved, close the issue.\n. I discovered where the heightvalue was being lost by analyzing the path of the heightuntil it was applied to the Chart.js canvas.\nIn the resize() method of chart.js, I calculate the new heightfor the chart, where aspectRatiois falsein our configuration, then calling helpers.getMaximumHeight(canvas)to get the new height.\nIn the getMaximumHeight(canvas) method in Helpers it is checked if the canvaselement has any parentNode, if it does not have canvas ``heightpickup, if it has (which is our case, the divaround the canvas p-chart template) calculates the height based on the height of the canvas.parentNode. In our case the divaround the canvas is the parentNode, and it has no defined height, and it ends up returning a default heightof 150.\nSolution\nIn this example, I copied the primeng p-chart component and made a change to the component template to apply the bind variable's heightalso in the divelement to the canvasthrone.\nThis is working perfectly for me.\nI'm going to submit a pull request, with this change, please check if this can have any side effects.. @dhniels , I had the same problem and opened a new question here #5748 , I'm even thinking about sending a PR with the fix, meanwhile I'm using a custom component with my implementation instead of the p-chart.\nIf you want to check my solution and possibly suggest something..

    "gatapia": "If you just want a custom filter (with the standard textbox) a workaround I am using is to set the table to [lazy]=\"true\"  you then implement a refresh method yourself, example:\n// template\n<p-datatable ...

Yes this was with beta2, here is the relevant section of my packages.json.\n\"primeng\": \"^1.0.0-beta.2\",\n    \"primeui\": \"^4.1.8\",\n. Thanks for this.  Just a note for others: this requires that required=\"true\" be set.  requred on its own does not work.\n. reset does not clear the filter input elements (global and columns).  It does reset the table tho.\n. I am playing around with the reset table exaple you gave above and have the following:\n```\n\n\n// Component\nreset(table: DataTable) {\n  table.globalFilter.value = '';\n  table.reset();\n}\n```\nHowever, the JavaScript API does not appear to expose the column filter input elements.  It would be cool to do:\ntable.columns.forEach(c => { if (c.filterInput) c.filterInput.value = ''; });\nPerhaps something to do in conjunction with the custom filter elements issue?\n. Workaround is to use disabled=\"true\" instead of readonly.  This has different styling.\n. Still happening for scrollable tables, fix here:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/383\n. Just looking at source now and it looks like accessing the sort/filter state is simple enough, just attach to onFilter/onSort events.  There appears to be now way to set these values back.\nSomewhat related, onSort fires the onFilter event even if filter has not changed, i.e. filter data (get filter event), sort data (get filter event then sort event).  I think that filter event is redundant.  minor issue though.\n. I currently have a hack where I do the following:\n```\ntemplate\nReset Table\n<p-datatable #table [value]=\"data\" ...\ncomponent\ninit() {\n  $http.get(..., (data) => { \n    this.data = data;\n    this.cloned = data.slice(0);\n  });\n}\nreset(table) {\n  table.reset();\n  this.data = this.cloned.slice(0);\n}\n```\nThis unsorts the data.  However, this is not ideal as it will not work with the default sort of the table.  \nI'm not familiar with DataTable's internals, does sorting actually change the bound array? I.e. Is my component's data array actually changed? If not just use that again.  If it is then perhaps; maybe add a data attribute to the TR dom node with its initial order and use this to sort?  Or perhaps have a map of some sort where a reference to each row's data is used to lookup its original index?  Something like.\n```\nin datatable.ts\n... after initial default sort\nthis.initialState = this.value.map((row, idx) => [row, idx]);\n... after table reset\n// use initialState to sort the this.value\n```\nTo be honest I'm not familiar enough with DataTable's internal to give good suggestions.  This is also a very minor issue so it would be a shame to sacrifice memory or performance for this but perhaps there is something efficient that can be done.\n. sweet!\nperhaps save the package.json as package.json.devel so its easier to keep in sync than a wiki page.\nEdit: This gets the showcase working but I tried to get this integrated with my application by doing the following:\nreplacing my primeng directory with a symlink to the dev primeng directory\nI get the following 404: \nhttp://localhost:3000/@angular/core/ 404 (Not Found)\nSo I tried adding a symlink to \"@angular\" directory in primeng dev folder but still did not work.  So I tried messing around with System.js to recognise index.js files but it was too much for a saturday :)\n. yes rendering is slow.  displaying large tables (> 400 rows or so) is basically unusable (using scrollable tables).  A quick profile reveals nothing only es6-shim, angular2-polyfills, etc.  The regular useless stacktraces.\n. This is an angular 2 issue.  For a quick fix (IE11 only) use core.js instead of es6-shim.  From the angular 2 issue a work around is:\n1. npm i core-js --save\n2. replace references to node_modules/es6-shim/es6-shims.min.js with node_modules/core-js/client/core.min.js .\n. Also seeing this, I have tried using quill.js from npm install quill and also quill.min.js from the quill download package no the quill home page: http://quilljs.com/\nDependencies on PrimeNG site say Quill 1.0 however quill version is 0.20.1 so not sure what you mean by 1.0\n. I think the following are the proper dependencies:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.quilljs.com/1.0.0-beta.3/quill.snow.css\" />\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.quilljs.com/1.0.0-beta.3/quill.min.js\"></script>\nPlease update the Editor page to include these instructions.\n. Setting the width on ContactName (which I dont want to do as I want it to take remaining space) yields slightly less misaligned results but still not great:\n\n. Just to clarify further, this only happens with scrollable=true tables as the header is a separate element from the body.\n. This is still an issue in RC6:\n\nCannot reopen issue, should I open a new one?\n. Reproduced in IE10 only (have not tried 9 and works ok in 11)\n. Any update on this one?\n. It is very hard to customise the toolbar with the version of Quill being used.  For instance; it is very hard to add the bullets (ql-list) button.  As it uses SVG to render itself making for a very ugly template.\nSo if I wanted to keep the current toolbar + a save button the template would be huge.  So I figured API access would be easier.\n. I just ended up upgrading my whole app to the new forms. Pain in the butt but this document really helps:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1RIezQqE4aEhBRmArIAS1mRIZtWFf6JxN_7B4meyWK0Y/pub\n. In beta 11, scrollHeight is just ignored.  The generates html is always 200px\n. I assume this is the showcase:\nhttp://www.primefaces.org/modena-primeng/#/forms\nIf so, then no it seems to work there.  Perhaps my upgrade to beta9 went wrong.  I'll investigate.\n. Ouch, this one was nasty.  For reference:\nUsing the following template:\n<p-dropdown options=\"options()></p-dropdown\nThis component method works:\nopts = [{label: '1', value: '1'}];\noptions() { return this.opts; }\nThis does not:\noptions() { return [{label: '1', value: '1'}]; }\nI assume its becuase the second is actually returning a new array on every request.  So just memoize the return value and all is ok.\nI think I've been bitten by this in the past and it still took me hours to find.  Don't think its you guys but rather an NG2 issue so closing for now, however if you can work around this crazyness it would make it good for your users.\n. Cool that works, seems a bit redundant though.\nClosing for now  \nThanks for your help\n.

There is no event at position 6 :cry: \n\nSo I suggest renaming rowIndex to absRowIndex and adding relRowIndex variable that will return relative row index for current datatable page.\n. Yep, positioning doesn't care where in DOM is overlay panel positioned.\nFor example:\nIf overlay panel's parent is relatively/absolutely positioned or is a table cell the panel will be situated far away because positioning logic in PrimeNG's DomHandler class determines offsets from the viewport but not from panel's parent. It may use offsetLeft & offsetTop in such cases.. @cagataycivici, please take a look at PR #872 that fixes this. It'll be nice if you managed to include this in \n1.0.0-beta.16 \n. @cagataycivici, \n@ContentChild(TemplateRef) rowExpansionTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;\nFinds a p-column's template instead of p-dataTables's one because it queries it's descendants by default since 2.0.1.\nMoving p-dataTable's template tag above p-columns fixes the issue.\nYou can replicate it with your own example by adding p-column's template:\n<p-dataTable [value]=\"cars\" expandableRows=\"true\">\n    <p-column expander=\"true\" styleClass=\"col-icon\"></p-column>\n    <p-column header=\"Vin\">\n      <template let-col let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n        <span>{{car.vin}}</span>\n      </template>\n    </p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"year\" header=\"Year\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"brand\" header=\"Brand\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"color\" header=\"Color\"></p-column>\n    <template let-car>\n        <div class=\"ui-grid ui-grid-responsive ui-fluid\" style=\"font-size:16px;padding:20px\">\n            <div class=\"ui-grid-row\">\n                <div class=\"ui-grid-col-3\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n                    <i class=\"fa fa-search\" (click)=\"showCar(car)\" style=\"cursor:pointer;float:left;margin-top:40px\"></i>\n                    <img src=\"showcase/resources/demo/images/car/{{car.brand}}-big.gif\">\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"ui-grid-col-9\">\n                    <div class=\"ui-grid ui-grid-responsive ui-grid-pad\">\n                        <div class=\"ui-grid-row\">\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-2 label\">Vin: </div>\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-10\">{{car.vin}}</div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"ui-grid-row\">\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-2 label\">Year: </div>\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-10\">{{car.year}}</div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"ui-grid-row\">\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-2 label\">Brand: </div>\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-10\">{{car.brand}}</div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"ui-grid-row\">\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-2 label\">Color: </div>\n                            <div class=\"ui-grid-col-10\">{{car.color}}</div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</p-dataTable>\n. Yes. The idea was Calendar component to be able to work with 2 formats (display format and binded model format). #1230 & #1231 seem to fix this. I'll try it when rc4 gets released.\n. Hi, I suffer the same problem.\n1. I choose a date (without time) from the calendar (ex. 2016-11-04)\n2. My model updates with a date object Fri Nov 04 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (FLE Standard Time)\n3. I send this date to the API I'm using but it works in UTC so it converts it resulting to 2016-11-03T22:00:00+00:00\n4. API field is date only (no time no timezone) and it stores it as 2016-11-03 which is wrong :(\nConsider choosing a date from the calendar (without time) set the date in 00:00:00 in UTC time but not 00:00:00 in local time zone. Selecting a date from browser in Germany should set 2016-11-04T00:01:00+01:00, in Bulgaria - 2016-11-04T00:02:00+02:00, etc...\nSo this line:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L429\nmay become \nthis.value = new Date(Date.UTC(dateMeta.year, dateMeta.month, dateMeta.day));\n.

    "brian428": "Can you explain further how you would envision this working with tab change events? I don't see how that's really an option. \nIt looks like relying on a change event would require hardcoded logic in the change handler method to detect which tab was added and what dynamic child component to insert. You also need some way to get a handle on a ViewContainerRef upon which createComponent() can be invoked.\nAlso, since there isn't a tab added event, it would require \"one-time\" detection logic to insert a dynamic child only the first time. I think it would also mean holding onto a reference to the new child so that it can be cleaned up/destroyed on tab close. Obviously, all of this would be better handled by the TabView/TabPanels themselves.\nSomething like this perhaps:\nhtml\n<p-tabView>\n  <p-tabPanel *ngFor=\"let thisTab of tabPanels\"\n    [header]=\"thisTab.header\" \n    [childComponent]=\"thisTab.childComponent\">\n  </p-tabPanel>\n</p-tabView>\nNow, it may be the case that you only want the Prime NG TabView to handle simple cases, since the work involved in supporting dynamic child components is clearly not trivial. But I'm not sure that using tab change events with the current TabView is really an option. Unless I'm missing something, I think developers would be forced to drop p-tabView and write their own tab component to really allow for this. . Unfortunately, I ended up having to hack together my own dynamic tab component, since there was no way to do this with the PrimeNG tabs.. This isn't complete, but hopefully it's enough to get others going down the right path:\nThe tabs array that I loop over in the view contains a reference to the desired child component to include:\nexport interface TabConfig {\n  key?: string;\n  title?: string;\n  removable?: boolean;\n  active?: boolean;\n  childComponent?: Type<any>;\n}\nThe tab component itself looks something like this:\n```\nimport {\n  Component, EventEmitter, HostBinding, Input, OnInit, OnDestroy, Output,\n  ViewContainerRef, ComponentRef, Type, ViewChild, AfterContentInit\n} from \"@angular/core\";\n@Component({\n  selector: \"dynamic-tab\",\n  template: \"\"\n})\n...\n@Input() public childComponent: Type = null;\n@ViewChild( \"dynamic_content_container\", { read: ViewContainerRef } ) dynamicContentContainer: ViewContainerRef;\nprotected dynamicComponent: ComponentRef = null;\nngAfterContentInit(): void {\n  if( this.childComponent !== null ) this.createChildComponent();\n}\nngOnDestroy(): void {\n  this.destroyChildComponent();\n}\nprivate createChildComponent() {\n  this.destroyChildComponent();\n  if( this.childComponent !== null ) {\n    this.dynamicComponent = this.dynamicComponentService.createComponent(\n      this.childComponent,\n      this.dynamicContentContainer\n    );\n  }\n  this.tabset.tabCreated.emit( this );\n}\nprivate destroyChildComponent() {\n  if( this.dynamicComponent !== null ) this.dynamicComponent.destroy();\n  this.dynamicComponent = null;\n}\n```\nFinally, the DynamicComponentService looks like this:\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class DynamicComponentService {\nconstructor( private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver ) {\n  }\ncreateComponent( component: Type, parent: ViewContainerRef ): ComponentRef {\n    if( component === null || component === undefined ) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    let componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory( component );\n    let componentRef = parent.createComponent( componentFactory );\n    return componentRef;\n  }\n}\n``. Is this actually fixed? The demo page (http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/growl) doesn't appear to set sticky=true, but the growls are still not automatically removed.\n. +1. Mixing the use of the deprecated router with the current one (used by my apps outside of PrimeNG) is _really_ not a fun problem to deal with.\n. For me, even using ngIf on the element doesn't work. Also, same problem appears to be happening withMultiSelect`.\n. For what it's worth, I did it like this:\n```html\n\n\n\n<template\n  *ngIf=\"thisColumn.type === 'string' || thisColumn.type === undefined\"\n  let-col let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n  <span class=\"col-string\">{{ data[ col.field ] }}</span>\n</template>\n\n<template\n  *ngIf=\"thisColumn.type === 'date'\"\n  let-col let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n  <span class=\"col-date\">{{ data[ col.field ] | date:'short' }}</span>\n</template>\n\n<template\n  *ngIf=\"thisColumn.type === 'string[]'\"\n  let-col let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n  <span class=\"col-string-array\">{{ data[ col.field ]?.join( \", \" ) }}</span>\n</template>\n\n\n\n``. Just a note: the same thing happens with the Calendar component.. Doesn't work, unfortunately. :-/. I think the problem I have with appendTo is actually the positioning/available space calculation issue I created in https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2128.. I wonder if just adding some sort of throttling to the checks that trigger change detection would help? e.g. once every 50ms or something. It's not a true solution, but at least it would greatly reduce the number of change detection passes.. +1. The odd thing is that it seems to work in the PrimeNG demo page.. You might try a more recent version. The workaround above (manually triggering show/hide) worked for me.. I had to extend TieredMenu and TieredMenuSub with my own classes and switch to usingdomHandler.relativePosition()instead ofdomHandler.absolutePosition(), along with some custom CSS margins for.ui-tieredmenu, to get this to work. Right now, tiered menu positioning is totally broken whenever the component is nested within something like a Dialog. As already pointed out, this seems to be because the positioning is done relative to the parent component instead of the body.. IfappendTo=\"body\"` works, this needs to be added to the docs and the TSD.. You probably want to post this to the primereact issue tracker. This is the primeng issue tracker, so it's highly unlikely you'll find the answer here.. Yep, I'm seeing this as well. Something related to the slider got messed up in one of the newer builds. I know this worked at some point in the past but I'm not sure when the problem was introduced.\nEdit: my guess this popped up after the conversion to native slider.\n. Great, thanks! Any idea when this will get pushed out in a release?. Is there a reason this hasn't been included in the final 2.0 release?. @cagataycivici Just trying to get some sort of answer about getting these fixes merged into master, because they never made it into the final 2.0. Could someone actually merge these fixes in please?. @cagataycivici Just trying to bump this since these fixes still haven't actually been merged into the master branch. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/confirmdialog/confirmdialog.ts#L223\nCan someone please get these merged in? Thanks.. @cagataycivici Any progress on this? You've got a great library here, but understanding what has been changed/fixed/added between versions is way more difficult than it should be. Can't whoever is writing the various blog posts and forum posts just update a CHANGELOG.md file as well? Or use a package like conventional-changelog to generate a CHANGELOG? Please consider addressing this. Thanks.. The bizarre thing is that they post occasional version updates on their blog, which means someone is doing some level of tracking on what has changed. Why they've decided to post these to their blog (where few will see it) instead of updating a README is truly baffling.. Just updating today and once again realizing how absurd it is that there's no CHANGELOG, so once again I get to do manual version comparisons to try and determine what actually changed.\nCould the PrimeNG folks please add a CHANGELOG? It'd be two years late, but better late than never.. As already mentioned, the index (i) passed to remove is not initialized. The *ngFor needs to be:\n*ngFor=\"let file of files; let i = index;\".. In the meantime, you can work around this by using @ViewChild() in your component to get a reference to the FileUploader (I'm naming it fileUpload in the below example), then specify a custom file template:\nhtml\n<template let-file let-i=\"index\" pTemplate=\"file\">\n  <div class=\"ui-fileupload-row\">\n    <div><img [src]=\"file.objectURL\" *ngIf=\"fileUpload.isImage(file)\" [width]=\"fileUpload.previewWidth\" /></div>\n    <div>{{file.name}}</div>\n    <div>{{fileUpload.formatSize(file.size)}}</div>\n    <div><button type=\"button\" icon=\"fa-close\" pButton (click)=\"fileUpload.remove(i)\"></button></div>\n  </div>\n</template>. This could be an optional setting, but I don't think it should just replace the current behavior. There are plenty of reverse cases where you want the collapsed tabs to persist so the view's state is maintained.. The frustrating thing is that this was supposedly fixed (https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1672), but the fixes were never actually merged into the master branch. I think someone forgot, but I'm hoping it'll actually get done ASAP.. It looks like this pull request was closed without ever being merged into master? As you can see here, these changes never made it in: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/confirmdialog/confirmdialog.ts#L224. Hmm it happens every time I run the above Plunkr. Here are two screenshots. The first is the initial layout of the calendar field. The second is what happens when I click into the calendar field, and the calendar is rendered below (and off the screen) of the field, instead of being positioned above the field.\n\n\n. Just to add, I'm testing it in both the latest Chrome and Firefox, with the same result in both browsers.. No solution yet, other than I can stick some logging statements into the PrimeNG code and see the incorrect initial elementOuterHeight being used. I was going to try using CSS to force a minimum height on the overlay to see if that helped but haven't had a chance to try that yet.. Just to confirm: if you run my Plunkr from above, do you see the same behavior? If so, I'm baffled as to why @cagataycivici is apparently not seeing the same behavior if he runs the Plunkr.. Looks like it is breaking with Angular 4...I'll try to update it so it works again (and demonstrates the issue).. Ok, should be updated to use Angular 4 and PrimeNG 4-rc.2. Still showing the same sizing issue. http://plnkr.co/edit/ta6s9L?p=preview. And by \"works\", you mean you can see the calendar going off the bottom of the screen, right? Just making sure.. @cagataycivici any progress on this? I've updated my Plunkr to RC4 but this initial bad size calculation continues to be a problem. Just run this Plunkr, click on the calendar input, and watch the calendar appear below the input (causing scrollbar to appear) instead of appearing above the input: http://plnkr.co/edit/ta6s9L?p=preview\n. Sounds good, thanks!. Thanks, @cagataycivici !. Folks, I know PrimeNG is free so we can't complain much. And I thank them for their contribution to the community. But... \nPrimeNG is being used in a lot of apps now. Regressions like this (which happen uncomfortably often) are why I'd urge (again) that PrimeFaces to build (or ask the community to help them build) a suite of unit tests for PrimeNG. If anyone wants to discuss this further, I set up a forum thread: https://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=50758. I've always been feeding a new array to the Growl component, like this:\nthis.notifications = [ ...this.notifications, value ];\nWhen I push a new notification, I see it show up, but so do all of the previous notifications. It's like the old items aren't getting cleared out by the Growl component. This worked fine before 4.0.0-RC.4.\nI'm trying to create a Plunkr to reproduce it.. @cagataycivici Here's a Plunkr that demonstrates the Growls not being cleared. http://plnkr.co/edit/9tjlBM?p=preview\nI assumed this was related to \"sticky\", and that even though the Growl fades, it was still considered sticky and isn't removed. If you'd like me to create a new issue, just let me know. . Just a note that similar problems manifest when using rowGroupMode=\"subheader\" in combination with paging. The data for each grouped row looks correct, but the rowData being used by the rowgroupheader template gets out of sync when paging around.\nI also noticed that removing the rowTrackBy value or changing rowTrackBy to a method call that returns a function and using the row index as the tracking value will resolve the problem.\nIn other words, this doesn't work:\n```\n\nitemRowTrackBy( index: number, row: RepReturnDuplicateItem ) {\n  return index;\n  // return row.id // also does not work, even though the IDs are a unique UUIDs\n}\n```\nbut this does:\n```\n\nitemRowTrackBy() {\n  return ( index: number, row: any ) => {\n    return this.model.uiList.fullList.indexOf( row );\n  };\n}\n```\nI'll try to create a Plunkr to demonstrate some of this, but it seems like there's an issue with either feeding the correct rowData into the group header template, or with row tracking with row grouping?. It really needs something, because as far as I can tell, there's no way to validate anything entered using an editable DataTable.. After trying to implement editing in a DataTable, there seems to be a parallel issue: if you use your own template for the editor, it looks like none of the keypress listeners work. Escape and Enter keys do nothing, and the only way to \"stop\" editing is to tab away from the cell or click somewhere outside the editor.\nSince a custom template seems to be the only way to enforce validation, either the way the listeners work needs to change, or some mechanism to relay events from the custom template to the DataTable needs to be added, or a good bit of documentation needs to be added to explain how a developer should mimic what the DataTable is doing internally to handle these things?. Is dt exposed as a template variable (via let)? Or do we need to declare the DataTable as a template variable ourselves?. In that case, it probably makes sense to update the docs to state that fit mode is basically ignored if column resize is enabled?. Same error here. Important to note that it works fine with PrimeNG 5.0.2. Only 5.2 is now throwing these errors.. @cagataycivici just wanted to point out that this issue (also noted in #5004) is completely blocking us from upgrading to 5.2. It's affecting virtually all of our Dialogs.. Appears to be caused by #4686.. As I said in the other thread: I don't think so. Prod mode doesn't do the check for values changing while change detection is happening, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. Just that the error isn't being thrown. The PrimeNG code needs to change to ensure that values aren't changing during change detection (which didn't start happening until PrimeNG 5.2).. I'm getting the same error, but for ui-inputwrapper-focus. I assume it's the same problem though.. I don't think so. Prod mode doesn't do the check for values changing while change detection is happening, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. Just that the error isn't being thrown. The PrimeNG code needs to change to ensure that values aren't changing during change detection (which didn't start happening until PrimeNG 5.2).. Thanks @cagataycivici I'll give this a try when the next version drops!. Already being tracked in #5004 and #4982. Still waiting on input from the PrimeNG folks though.. Appears to be caused by #4686.. The build system can't just be swapped out. Switching to a CLI build would probably take several weeks of refactoring. Anyone with a project older than a year or so is probably using a SystemJS-based build, because the CLI really only became a viable option in the last year or so. Before that, everyone (including the Angular team themselves) were recommending SystemJS.. Yes, I didn't mention the height calculation logic not taking into account other elements (like toolbars), but I've also run into the same problem. I've also seen this affect the computed height of Dialogs. I have to do hacky things like set the height to \"calc(100% - 50px)\" and so on. When I have time I'll try to open another ticket for that, since I think it's a different issue (since it seems to affect Dialog, and Table, and probably other things that compute height).. OK, but that's why I asked for some method to be exposed to manually trigger the scrollHeight to recalculate. If the table can't do it automatically, then it seems like there should be a method we can call to have it recalculate the pixels based on either the parent element height, or possibly having an element as an argument that is used to base the height calculation on?. @ethnoplex Excellent solution and works perfectly as far as I can tell! Tested in latest Chrome, FF, and Edge. Hopefully the PrimeNG folks will consider adding this enhancement to the library.. The Dialog \"ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError\" error in 5.2.0 was fixed in 5.2.1, but now this is another total blocker. We're still stuck at version 5.0.2. :-/. Actually, overriding the style like:\n.ui-tieredmenu,\n.ui-tieredmenu .ui-menu-child {\n  z-index: 5000 !important;\n}\nSeems to (mostly) work, as a temporary hack.. After some trial and error, it seems easier to force the z-index on the Dialog than to do it on the overlays the dialog could contain:\n.ui-dialog {\n  z-index: 1000 !important; /* TODO: primeng: temporary fix for 5.2.1 bug #5271 */\n}. @cagataycivici Maybe the example I sent wasn't clear, so I've updated it. I'm not even using the rowGroupMetadata, I only had that in there to support the version shown in the docs.\nWhether I use a pre-sorted array of data, or specify an onSort() handler, or specify a custom sort function, the row group children are still incorrect. My isRowGroupHeader() method is correctly identifying which rows should be treated as row group headers (you can see this in the browser console). Despite all of this, only the first child row in each group is ever shown.\nI understand that you're leaving this up to the developer to implement as they choose, which is fine. The point is that I'm implementing it in a way that seems to best suit the situation, and everything I'm doing seems correct, yet it still doesn't work. \nFinally, the docs don't give any actual information on what's going on with the header rows vs. the rowexpansion template. What actually happens here? Is the intent that the *ngIf only handles group header rows, but the rowexpansion template is run for every row (regardless of whether it is a header row or not)? If that is the intent, then my example shows that it isn't actually doing that (it's only showing the first child in each group and skipping output for all the other child rows).. ",

This link to an issue is the way to go to fix this, relate to this comment: 300#issuecomment-217253716\n. @pantonis Did you test the comment i linked?\n. It's not quite a bug, just that they made it as a bundle instead of making it a dependency.\n. Why's that? i used mine in an NgUpgrade project with Ng1 and Ng2, all Ng1 code was legacy and Ng2 code is mine and it went perfectly when i replaced the JQuery lib with the PrimeNg bundle.\n. I did include the file as primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.js, however the dialog works but the panel menu don't.\n. I get that it is a native component, as i said i already imported primeui-ng-all.min.js and the error above shows.\n. Ooohhh (0o0) i didn't know that, however the issue with that is that the project is an Ng1 project upgraded with NgUpgrade to support Ng2 code, the Ng1 itself uses JQuery and it's outside of webpack, should i just run my vendor.js file (which imports the primeui-ng-all.min.js) above that code and remove the reference to JQuery?\n. Ok it's done and works, i just used the copy plugin to copy primeui-ng-all.min.js to my dist/js folder and replaced the jquery code like:\nhtml\n<script src=\"./js/primeui-ng-all.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- <script src=\"./jquery/jquery-2.2.3.min.js\"></script> -->\nIt actually fixed another issue i had with resizable columns.\n. I would also like to have this feature in the near future.\nAbout your use case, i feel like you're directly editing the css provided by the primeng package, am i right?\nIn my case i don't alter the teme exactly because your issue, instead i override the theme which in most cases it comes down to redefining those properties with an !important property, and before anyone yell at me, yes i know that's a bad design, but is better that editing the original theme and in each update having to scan changes, make edits or god knows what other witchery can be done.\n. @cagataycivici Wow, i guess those premium SCSS themes need's some appeal to sell huh?\n@koen-serneels Did i nailed it with you editing the css inside the npm module? i think my approach would be better for your case too, still making diffs?\n. Should take in account the custom footer, in my case the header is 38px, but footer is 65px.. @dhniels Use the emojis to express +1 in the specific comment you want, or the issue description itself for the issue.\n+1 comments don't give value to the conversation aside of bloating the comments feed, emoji feature was added for that purpose, there's a lot of issues out there with lots of +1 that make the issue harder to scan, that makes it harder for the devs who have to read once and again all comments to understand the context of the issue.\nNow that you know spread the word so we stop this +1 chain.. @jo75 I think most people does work with the demo page, the issue is when implementing with no delay, basically when the values are local and not from server.\nAlmost all workarounds are about getting the autocomplete ViewChild reference and telling it to trigger focus and show.. @Temetz Setting the timeout to 0 or just dropping the delay still works.\nThus it's a race condition, the setTimeout without time set's the task to be at last in the JS event queue, quite an interesting bug there.\nBtw is the same both for the freaking completeMethod callback and the onDropdownClick callback.. It seems i have another issue, pressing first time in dropdown does show the list, but the second time it doesn't show, ever again, unless i use the text field of the autocomplete to start another search and then click again, then it works.. Seems like the workaround is to call the show method in the autocomplete when either the dropdown button is called, or the filter function (for when typing for autocomplete) is called, that way you ensure it shows.\nThough we need to be careful of race conditions, the workaround works but the suggestions are loaded correctly only if some delay is introduced between the suggestion's variable assignation and the call of the show method.. @StevenLiekens I think you miss-typo in the visible binding, lacks left bracket, is that in your code as well or just bad copy-paste?. It seems not, it seems an easy one to fix with Getter/Setter, so it should be fixed ages ago.. @StevenLiekens I'm sorry, i didn't read your post thoroughly enough to notice that it works if the event is forwarded to the dialog's hide method, anyways it's weird that we need to do such thing to make it work, what if we call the hide method from code and we don't have any event to pass to it? would it need to create a dummy event only to get this to work?\n@cagataycivici I still think this issue is still unresolved, i think @StevenLiekens hack is a workaround, not a solution.. Ok so it works if we call the hide method, am i right? what about if we just change the variable, does it still triggers the onAfterHide event?. That's the issue i want fixed, that variable is a binding, an input & output for showing/hiding the dialog, so in theory it should as well trigger such events (onBeforeHide & onAfterHide event, and any other that relates to hide).. Since the error states a change of value from undefined to 152, searching the dom for that value gives 3 results:\n\nFirst one is an icon of 152 width and height (non related).\nIs an style property (as well, not related).\nAnd 3\u00b0 one is the winner, is this specific ui-slidemenu-content item, which has an style property setting it's height property to 152px, i think here lies the issue.\n\n\nP.D: I've tested with the normal menu and woks very well.\n. After more testing it seems this error was introduced in version 1.1.0, it seems it is a very big change in that component when i look the 1.0.0 and compare to 1.1.0 tag in github.\nSince there's just a few places where the ui-slidemenu-content is being changed, my raw guess is in line #L149, maybe it's because is inside ngAfterViewInit hook?.. @cagataycivici Tested, indeed changing ngAfterViewInit to ngAfterContentInit solves this issue.. @bogdanvaduva Did you test the same fix i tried?\n@cagataycivici Tested in latest version 2.0.3, yet to be fixed.. @bogdanvaduva That was a fast answer, i was reminded of this issue when i tried updating primeng so i lost the fix made directly in node_modules, since it's such small fix i wonder why it hasn't been fixed, i even took the work to debug it all the way through.. @cagataycivici Thanks for tackling this issue, i've seen the commit, tough i don't really understand how it works, you removed the css binding and made the change in style through the native element in the ngAfterViewInit hook, right?\nAny insight when will the update with this fix come out? which version?. Hi, it works all right for me when using the [formGroup]='formFieldInClass', maybe is the angular version? i'm using angular 4 (though i shouldn't because primeng asks for angular 2 \ud83d\ude1d ).. In my case with version 4.0.2:\n\nAlso this happens when the page loads with the variable set to true, basically initializing before it should.\nIt effectively fixes if i put my initialization code into ngAfterViewInit.. I was about to make an issue about this, then updated to latest just because the issue says to check with latest (rc.3 which happened to go out 3 days ago) and since it was fixed i went searching the commit, and from the commit to this issue.\n\nNice work @cagataycivici, primeng is seriously helping my dev process. \ud83d\ude04 . Same here, going back to 2.0.5 fix the issue but styles are a bit broken with Ng4.. Also this happens when the page loads with the variable set to true, basically initializing before it should.\nIt effectively fixes if i put my initialization code into ngAfterViewInit.. @giovstef75 after RC1 it worked without doing anything?. Oh he just published a few seconds ago.. Oh no wait, it's working for me with RC.2.. It breaks for me when using initialization of the isVisible variable in constructor or ngOnInit, but it works again when i put such initialization in ngAfterViewInit.\nAlso worth noticing i'm using the async pipe to fetch that value from @ngrx/store.. @giovstef75 Can you check where do you set the isVisible variable?. @giovstef75 That was almost the same as my issue, i was using the async pipe and the error in my case was because i have Redux set up with Webpack's HMR and LocalStorage persistance, so if i saved file or just closed and opened the Electron app when the dialog was open, the variable value ended up set up to true inside the ngOnInit subscription after the reload, thus my fix was as simple as to subscribe in the ngAfterViewInit hook.. @leachryanb So initializing to false and move all initialization of the visible variable to the ngAfterViewInit hook didn't worked for you?\nIt's very likely that such commit is the trouble maker, but aside from the workaround mentioned i can't help much since i put it to work like that.. Too little description, try adding which devices and some screenshots of the errors.. @sudheerj First of all the description is too small and ambiguous, @wl1leo should put at least which devices is he talking to:\nPC? Mobile?, which versions?, Win 8? 10? Ubuntu 17.04? Mac OSX Sierra?, what about the browsers where he executed the code? Chrome 57 or any other browser?\nThere's no point in testing anything if he doesn't specify better in which devices it fails.. I've been updating many deps, and i cannot replicate right now, i'll post again if it ever happens again.. What's the reason for hours > 11 && hours != 12?\nIsn't that effectively the same as hours > 12?. I'd say it's not a big performance difference to compress as i've said, but it makes the code more readable, it's actually confusing to look at that conditional, it leaves me wondering whyyyy?. First format your code, is painful to read.\nSecond, your selected item variable is named template?. It just happened to me after yarn upgrade, using yarn --force reinstalled all packages and fixes it, still weird it failed after upgrade.. ",

How can we use debouncing for the OnFilter event?\n. Tried to create a custom directive but cannot be done as there is no actual event asssociated with onFilter\n. How can you claim that you increased datatable perf if you missed such a feature which is easy to implement and is actually a perf bottelneck \ud83d\udc4e . @tigermev check this property filterDelay on https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable. \nFiltering is implemented using timers which is not the best way as it does not utilize the power of observables but rather is using old inefficient techniques. I hope implementation changes \n. I installed 4.0.0 Still getting the same problem. I have checked the source code the changes you commited are not there.. I can confirm that this was fixed in 4.0.1\nThank you. @MayerMar thanks man took me hours to solve the problem. Any news on this bug?. I found the cause of the issue. It is not actually a code bug but rather a problematic design and implementation of expand functionality. \nfindExpandedRowIndex(row: any): number {\n        let index = -1;\n        if(this.expandedRows) {\n            for(let i = 0; i < this.expandedRows.length; i++) {\n                if(this.expandedRows[i] == row) {\n                    index = i;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return index;\n    }\nIn the code above object equality check is done which fails when update of the data (new reference) is added to the table. This has as a result to always return false since new object is not the same as the old one. \nIn most grids out there who support this functionality, when expandable rows is used you have to pass a column id (primeNg datatable calls this dataKey) in order to perform the check on the actual value of the row instead of the reference.\n. I think we could @cagataycivici what do you say?. @cagataycivici How do I prevent closing of the sidebar when outside is clicked?\nThanks. @bjareczek can you share code fix. Use the onHide event which is fired when sidebar is closing Sidebar. Yes this is highly needed. . Please see call stack attached:\n\n. Any news. It causes chrome to become unresponsive. Any word on that?\nStill wondering how did the performance of the Datatable was improved if such a major bug causes chrome to be unresponsive?\n. you mean server side?. 1000 is not huge dataset. Why did you close this issue?. That is a very nice option to have. Any estimate?. Any news on this one?. what a shame. I do not see it in 7,1 list. I suppose he will do it once he wants :). @cagataycivici the style works you are correct. \nstyleClass does not work. Try to remove the width from style and add it to the my-class. Problem occurs when you add this class to the css file of the component where I use the sidebar. \nIf I add the my-class in a global css file it works.. According to this excellent article Design better data tables sticky headers is a basic requirement for good UX. Because there is a bug when you refresh the data and there is sorting selected and you arenot on the first page but on another page, as soon as the data are refreshed it always jumps to first page. \nI have checked with a lot of other data tables out there and not a single of them have this behavior. All of them preserve the current selected page.. No I shouldn't width should be set to auto. If I set this to auto text overlaps the text of the column next to it. This is a bug. . @cagataycivici  This is a bug and I dont understand why you avoid it. I have already open a ticket in which you provided a dirty workaround. \nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4247. @cagataycivici In order to use this table do we need to migrate from the old datatable?. Downloaded latest code from master and while clicking on table I get\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'table'\nError: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'table'\nAdding the following in src/app/showcase/app-routing.module.ts solves the problem\n{path: 'table', loadChildren: './components/table/tabledemo.module#TableDemoModule'},  . @cagataycivici can you give an example of how paginatorLeftTemplate  is used?. This is very ugly. I cant use columns due to the fact that I cannot customize my headers (th) using Directives. @bias-keenly Thanks. @cagataycivici  What about no dynamic columns? How is this going to work?. Maybe related to this #4885 \nFor a temp workaround I set [lazy]=\"false\". Same for exporting. It should not depend on dynamic columns. You added a globalfilters field. What about exporting?\n. How can I test this? Is there any way to reference latest code from github?. @cagataycivici Can you add the optional parameter for resetting the paging and sorting on data update?. @cagataycivici any comment?\n. I think I know why he wont fix it. This fix exploits more bugs to the turbotable. When you are in fifth page and filter the data are not shown when this fix is applied..  @cagataycivici I have vast experience with business intelligence and tabular data for years.  I have never seen this behavior before.\nIn any case If you wish to keep this behavior It would be good to have it optional as you said. I will be waiting for this change. Thanks. Yes. For me every time I npm install have to go and manually change it. Sometimes it does not AOT build because of my changes.\nHope @cagataycivici changes this.\n. I already commited a fix but was declined by the owner of the repo. @burzum619 What I did was to remove this.first = 0;\nThis:\n_filter() {\n        this.first = 0;\n......\nbecomes this:\n_filter() {\n        ....... also another problem with this behavior when data is refreshed is you are in page 4 and type something in global filter and then new data comes in filtering does not work. @cagataycivici I will test it and let you know\n. @cagataycivici This works partially. When set [resetPageOnSort]=\"false\" and you sort, go topage 3 and then type something in the global filter, then clear filter,  table jumps to first page always . OK that works but I think you got ascending and descending wrong. Descending should show the up-arrow and ascending down-arrow . @cagataycivici This is no longer valid for TurboTable 6.0.0. Can you suggest how to do it now?\n. @glenr8 Thanks . @daphnecorrea apparently no one cares :). @cagataycivici Any estimate on fixing this issue?. @JacobSiegle I have over a hundred tables with over a thousand columns in total. Setting minimum height for each of these columns is not usable at all. So your proposed solution is not something that really helps.\nHope you understand.. @JacobSiegle Thanks for your suggestion but as I explained setting the min-width of each column is not a viable solution to me. I have seen dozens of tables that have the requested bugfix which is working without any problems when not setting styles for width and they just work perfect.\nThis is surely a bug or miss of a very important feature from this library. @JacobSiegle \nThe tables that have the feature you're talking about (like your bootstrap example) are simple table\nNo they are not. I have seen tables with more features than TurboTable that support this functionality.\nI believe this isn't a bug but a defect from a design choice\nThe end result is the same. Workaround is hack fix\nThanks\n. @cagataycivici ?. @cagataycivici \nlet csv = '';. @cagataycivici Any news on this one?. ",

    "ctrl-brk": "Here: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1005. I have no idea what's going on with this. I'm waiting myself for almost a year now.. Would be nice to have the same for the DataTable emptyMessage. Already did ;)\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2395. Same issue still exists in multisort mode. Do you have AutoCompleteModule in your module's imports?\n. There's kind of hack to fix it. See this post:\nhttp://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=48781. Scrollable also breaks resizable and reordable functionality.\nHere's the issue I created:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1005\n. There are still quite a few issues with the scrollable data table even in RC2.\nTry to make is scrollable with resizable and reordering columns. Fill it with data, so scroll appears. Fill with less data so there's no scroll. Play with headers size and order and you will see all kinds of strange behavior.. Unfortunately there's no autofit. All cells have equal size by default. But you can specify width.\n[style]=\"{'width': '100px'}\"\n. It works for me with header. And [style] attribute needs to be in square brackets. Do you have any other styles/settings on your table?\n. That's becase .ui-growl-item-container.ui-state-highlight.ui-growl-message-... (success, error, etc) are not even defined in the bootstrap theme css. I have this issue reported already. I would say the Omega theme seems to be the one which gets most attention, not all of them.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1143\n. try to to add this to plugins in rollup.config.js\n```\n    commonjs({\n        namedExports: {\n            // left-hand side can be an absolute path, a path relative to the current directory, or the name of a module in node_modules\n            'node_modules/primeng/primeng.js': [ 'InputTextModule' ]\n        }\n``\n. I don't use aot yet, but I had similar issue with rollup and the configuration above fixed it. You can google more for namedExports there are might be some other options.\nBut I have another huge issue with rollup. The code just simple doesn't work after tree shake. Rollup removes some chunks which it shouldn't.\n. And I personally would prefer 'unselect' only in multi select mode. In single mode the selection should only change when you click on the other row, not on the same one.\n. Don't select it in the first place ;) Really, why do you need to unselect a single item? One option would be to use Ctrl-click\n. derchiurg, so you have a list with let's say one item. You click on this item and some details appear. You click one more time and details disappear. On and off on the same view, nothing else happens. I can't remember any grid acting this way.\n. May be it can be configurable in some way? Select/unselect, keys/mouse etc.\n. @santoshsas, shift should select everything from currently selected item to the shift-clicked item. Not just duplicate ctrl-click functionality.. There's no row deselect in single selection mode on desktop devices. In multiselect you can use ctrl-click. That's the default system behavior.  Works exactly as it should.\n. Here's the same issue and hack\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1600#issuecomment-268235330. With 5.2.7 release there's not even a blog post. Go figure.... Why would you need to unselect in single mode? Anyway, such functionality should be optional, not the only way.. I should say that PrimeNG 1.1.2 doesn't have this issue.\nAnd also need to remind that column headers still disappear when sorted, so It's still necessary to hack the datatable.js file.\nFor 1.1.2 change the line number 1619 to this:            template: \"\\n        \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n                \\n                    \\n

     \\n    \",. @trgllc I'm curious which one you've chosen?. No offense here )) We appreciate all your hard work.\nBut those issues are known for over a year now.\nThe simplest test is to enable scrolling, column resize and reorder and fill the grid with just a few records, so the scrolling is not happening. You will see header misalignment and just try to resize/reorder columns multiple times - it will have issues.. Try to use pipe for date formatting instead of template. I think it works for me.. I'm sorry. Never mind. You are right, still need a template. Sorting seems to work though.. Try to give [style]=\"{'overflow': 'inherit'}\" to this column. In my case datatable with ~3000 rows is not practically useful at all. The whole browser becomes unresponsive with any key press.. I would suggest you to create a new issue. Seems like they've closed all Datatable issues without even looking at them (that's sad because lots of them apply to the new version too) when released the new TurboTable.\nIt also doesn't look like there will be any future updates for Datatable. And I'm afraid that Datatable will be completely removed soon so you're going to stick to some older version of primeng without ability to update it.. Ctrl-click will deselect.\nWould be nice to have this behavior configurable, so you can use either Ctrl-click for multiselect grids or just simple click for single.. Works for me\nChrome v. 57.0.2987.98. It's an old bug. Multiple issues submitted already, but.... @pavel-sindelka works for me. Which Angular version do you use? ng-template is Angular4. Yes, but it's annoying to put everywhere. Would be nice to see. Can you make it work with primeng tooltip?\nBut it's still a component you have to add at every datatable column. Still too bulky.. Do you apply this directive to the whole table or per column? I would like per table.. But applying it to every single column (and I have tons of them) is annoying. That's why it's desirable to be implemented within the table component itself, not as a directive.. That's why I'm asking for having built-in functionality in the table. So I just set one parameter and all columns automatically have the tooltip (I don't care what kind).. Thanks you. But you still need to apply it to each column and even convert the column into template if it doesn't have one. Lots of labor. I still hope that the Prime guys will built such functionality right into the table component.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2219#issuecomment-300739505. Well, you can always contribute and write these tests.. What does \"it handles loading property itself\" mean? If I don't specify loading property there's no spinner or any visual effect. And if I do I have \"expression changed...\" error. I need to change loading property within setTimeout to get rid of this error.. For me they are misaligned even if I don't specify any width.. Do you have some DataTable plunker I can start with?. Do you have a DataTable plunker I can start from?. From the docs:Default match mode is \"startsWith\" and this can be configured using filterMatchMode property of column object that also accepts \"contains\", \"endsWith\", \"equals\" and \"in\"So, strongly speaking it's not a bug.. What do you mean \"broken\"? Works for me.. Do you have any hidden columns? There's an issue with them.. @Dharmik8478 you might be right. I has the similar issue having component withing component. Had to tweak menu's style specifically within this one nested component.. Even better if the column would add a tooltip to itself if the content doesn't fit.. Is there any example how to do it?. You can also make this behavior global. That's what I use:.ui-datatable .ui-datatable-data>tr>td {overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap}`. Ok. OnPush helps a bit although there's filtering issue I reported here: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4501\nBut the performance in general is still an issue. There are just 3000 records - it's not that many at all but you can experience significant delays on initial load and filtering.. I have a similar issue reported here https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4452 which was closed for unknown reason. Switching to onPush (though in this case you have to move datatable part to a separate component) helps a bit, but it's not clear in general why datatable is so slow having not that many records.. Here's my version of the \"autofocus\" directive. It refers to my custom components but you can replace it with whatever you need\n```\n@Directive({ selector: '[appAutoFocus]' })\nexport class AutoFocusDirective implements AfterViewInit {\n    private _show = true;\nconstructor(\n    private _ref: ElementRef,\n    @Host() @Self() @Optional() private _it: InputTextComponent,\n    @Host() @Self() @Optional() private _cb: ComboboxComponent,\n    @Host() @Self() @Optional() private _cs: CompanySearchComponent,\n    @Host() @Self() @Optional() private _fs: FileSearchComponent,\n) {}\n\n@Input() set appAutoFocus(show: boolean | string) {\n    if (typeof(show) === 'boolean') //typeof is string if parameter not specified\n        this._show = show;\n}\n\nngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    if (!this._show) return;\n\n    let el: HTMLElement;\n    if (this._it)\n        el = this._it.nativeElement;\n    else if (this._cb)\n        el = this._cb.nativeInputElement;\n    else if (this._cs)\n        el = this._cs.nativeInputElement;\n    else if (this._fs)\n        el = this._fs.nativeInputElement;\n    else\n        el = this._ref.nativeElement;\n\n    el.focus();\n}\n\n}\n``. @KrishnaPuppala, that's a natural Angular behavior. When you use a property surrounded by square brackets it expects a variable, not value. By using quotes it makes it string value.. You can add a css style for ui-dialog-titlebar:hover or ui-dialog-title:hover. Looks like this has been fixed.. @bossqone as a temporary workaround you can try to save the initialLazyLoadEventevent and then use it when the data is ready.. @toregua, This is just visual representation. Still you have to deal with two different lists/selections and unable to unselect context menu selection. I need it to be just like old datatable. One selection for everything. @cyberrranger solution is just a hack.. It looks like the support for child properties was removed from TurboTable (it worked in old DataTable). I have to do all the parsing myself now but I'm not using such properties as a key.. Try to addappendTo=\"body\"to your list. You can add rxjs-compat to your package.json for the time being.. @chrisGH, to the \"dependencies\". Did you install primeicons and include the css?. When using square brackets use single quotes around your field name. [pSortableColumn]=\"'field'\". Or make thefield` a member of your class.. Works for me in Omega theme. Did you install primeicons?. Do you also load the primeicons css?. Install primeicons, include css from there. Yes, looks like you need to install it manually for now. Their intend was that you can use your own icons (glyph, fa, etc) OR primeicons but I'm not sure how to achieve this yet. \nYou need to use node_modules/primeicons/primeicons.css. There's already a ticket to make right click functionality the same way it was in DataTable. Not sure if it's still open, can't find it now.. In case of lazy loading you have to do your sorting on the server side. It's unclear what the issue is. In lazy load mode sorting and filtering are on you to be done on the server site.. When you perform either sort or search it should make a request to the server side and not sort locally. Seems to be working fine for me.. There should be only lazyLoad events, you don't need anything else.. Yep. That's what I do.. p-table (aka TurboTable) is the component to use. Datatable is deprecated and not supported anymore.. With lazy load you need to do your sorting and filtering on the server side.. ",

I had to manually adjust the pageX and pageY property so that it open to the left of cursor.\n. same error here.\n. After adding an entry in primeng.d.ts and primeng.js make the build successful\n\nprimeng.d.ts - export * from './components/fileupload/fileupload';\nprimeng.js export * from './components/fileupload/fileupload';\n. @cagataycivici Thanks for adding a way to customize UI. However, I'm still looking for something really simple.\n\nAs I mentioned, I would like to have single button with auto upload support which is now working as intended. But wonder if I can hide upload and cancel button. Also, in my case I don't want to show File List UI, so I want to hide this as well.\nBasically, if we could switch between Basic and Advance UI, that would be great. Something like this https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/basic-plus.html , but again, the File List UI should be optional so one can hide it easily if not needed.\nAnd finally, there should a Label property to change the default text \"Choose\" of file selection input.\n. what is an ETA for beta 15?\nAlso, can we update to Angular RC6 before beta 15?\n. @moxival Yes.\n. @cagataycivici Could you please put your thoughts on this?\n. Now that the Angular 2 officially released. It would be good to have it working in the next release.\n. Any chance of having it functional in beta 16?\n. @qdouble How does material 2 and other 3rd party packages run fine in AOT mode? I'm even able to compile my application in AOT mode if I remove PNG dependency, isn't that mean PNG not AOT compatible yet?\n. According to this github issue https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11889 , it looks like the 3rd party module must ship the metadata files. \n. @cagataycivici Looks like these are the steps required to generate metadata files\nhttps://medium.com/@isaacplmann/getting-your-angular-2-library-ready-for-aot-90d1347bcad#.mtna6ixy8\n. @cagataycivici I made a pull request. Please check https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/1004\nIt would be great to have it in beta17.\n. @cagataycivici I agree, metadata.json should not be under version control. I believe you could generate those before publishing to npm. This is how ng-bootstrap and angular material doing as well.\n. Also, AMO shipping the ts files in npm package would not be an ideal solution.\n. @cagataycivici Sure, These are the steps for generating the files\n1) Install angular compiler \n\nnpm install @angular/compiler-cli @angular/platform-server --save\n\n2) Get tsconfig for AOT from the Angular doc\nhttps://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html\n3) Add script in package.json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"ngc\": \"ngc -p ./tsconfig-aot.json\"\n  }\n4) Changed the components template url (if they are not inline) from Absolute to Relative Path.\nEg:\n@Component({\n    templateUrl: 'components/blockui/blockui.html'\n})\nTo \n@Component({\n    templateUrl: './blockui.html'\n})\n5) Remove typings.json in favor of typescript 2.0, new way of defining type declaration files.\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/06/15/the-future-of-declaration-files/\nAnd add these in tsconfig so it looks for the typings file in the correct location\n\"typeRoots\": [\n            \"node_modules/@types\"\n        ],\n  \"types\": [\n            \"node\",\n            \"jquery\",\n            \"fullcalendar\"\n        ]\nYou may notice core-js is not listed, that is because it may throw duplicate identifier error if you include in list.\n6) Now finally run \n\nnpm run ngc\n\nYou may get several errors which are mostly related to access modifiers mentioned in the below article (3rd point,  that says private, protected accessors should be changed to public for any members accessed from template)\nhttps://medium.com/@isaacplmann/making-your-angular-2-library-statically-analyzable-for-aot-e1c6f3ebedd5#.9wzvvaym0\nAfter fixing those, you should be able to successfully compile with ngc.\nHope that helps!\n. @cagataycivici That's Great, There should be no impact by setting \"noImplicitAny\" to false.\nLooking forward to try this out. Thanks so much..\n. @adrienverge Thanks. \nYes, I'm successfully able to compile my Angular project by having PNG as dependency (with the Pull Request I made).\nWhat errors you are having when you run ngc?\n. Are you sure you checked out the 'ato' branch instead of master?\n. Does it have primeng.metadata.json next to primeng.d.ts?\n\nnode_modules/primeng/primeng.metadata.json\n. Can you paste your tsconfig.json here?\n. @adrienverge I created one https://github.com/ammar91/aot-primeng/tree/master\nHope that Helps!\n. @adrienverge Thanks for your feedback.\nIs there any pre-compilation needed?\n\nYes, that is because when you clone the branch it doesn't contain compiled js files. That is only available in the generated npm package.\nSo after cloning the branch (this pull request), you should have to run npm run tsc, that would give errors like Cannot find module 'angular2/core but  .ts  files should be compiled at this point. And after that when you run ngc, there won't be any errors.\n. This works for me without any errors.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/ammar91/aot-primeng.git\ncd aot-primeng\nnpm install\nrm -rf node_modules/primeng\ncd node_modules\ngit clone -b ato https://github.com/ammar91/primeng.git\ncd primeng\nnpm run tsc (ignore the errors)\ncd ../..\nnpm run ngc\n.

Maybe I have to mention it's a Electron app. But that must not make a difference. \n. It's an angular app. But that must not change the fact that I get an error\nwithin the file itself. If I load primeui-ng-all.js It must load jQuery in\nthe top portion of the file, but the error says that it can't find jQuery\nfurther down in the same file.

I've checked it out but, I'm not able to build it successfully. So Can you explain in short What I have to do to make primeng work in electron?\n\nI've tried to import the script like so \"import 'script!node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.js';\". But this gives me a new error. Now I get \"Error: ReferenceError: $ is not defined(\u2026)\"\n. Ok I have found a solution after a long search. It was indeed not primeng related but Electron related. \nI've installed jquery through npm\nand then I've added \n<script src=\"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>   \n<script src=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.js\"></script>\nIt's a bit strange to load jquery and then load the -all version.

Idd when you change node-integration to false it loads like a normal webpage in the browser. So there are no issues.\n. Ok I feel like an ass now. Apparently the only thing I had to do was to add \n'primeng': {\n  defaultExtension: 'js'\n}\nto the package. You don't need to reference the files in a script tag. So you can remove \n<script src=\"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>   \n<script src=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.js\"></script>\nand it still works. And no errors. \nSorry for all the fuss. \n. Any Idea when this will be in?. Can we reopen this? still not available in the new TurboTable. \nI would also like this.. I'm still having this problem. Sometimes you just want a function in the min and max date options.

    "sdmoralesma": "would be great if the \"expanded\" node helps to initialize the tree expanding it at will\n. I was thinking about \"faking\" click events through the tree. Dirty hack?... absolutely. Does it work?, Don't know... will try it later. If someone has a better idea please let us know.\n. Yes! I detailed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38285593/how-to-initialize-primeng-tree-component/38285594#38285594\nAs I told you is very bruteforce trick... sorry :)\n. Well given that the definition of TreeNode from PrimeNG is:\nexport interface TreeNode {\n    label?: string;\n    data?: any;\n    icon?: any;\n    expandedIcon?: any;\n    collapsedIcon?: any;\n    children?: TreeNode[];\n    leaf?: boolean;\n}\nI defined my custom type like:\nexport interface FileNode extends TreeNode {\n    id:string;\n    parentId?:string;\n}\nAnd the Tree will still work because FileNode is a TreeNode.\nYou can have some idea of how to make your own implementation here: filemanager.component.ts\nwith a live demo: javalab.co\n. the release date depends on the release of angular2, you can track the release of ang2 here: https://github.com/angular/angular/milestones. \nAs for the primeng roadmap:\n\nRoadmap\nWe need to do a couple of more things to do before releasing 1.0 final, these are fileupload and inputmask components along with enhancements to the datatable. Not definite yet but a spreadsheet component is also being considered. We\u2019d like to do 1.0.final after Angular2 goes final so our roadmap depends on Angular2 release.\n\nSource: http://blog.primefaces.org/?p=3937\nPlease use the forum for this discussions.\n. Angular2 has not been released: https://github.com/angular/angular/milestones . You are probably referring to the rc2 but keep in mind that this is not the final. Primeng beta9 is scheduled for the last week of June: https://twitter.com/prime_ng/status/744238701962760192?lang=en\nRight now (20/June/2016) is difficult to know when will be released either angular2 or primeng (last quarter of the year seems probable). However both projects are very stable (although not production ready).\n. The package that you are referring to is a wrapper for javascript AND css files, right now that dependency is necessary because primeng is using the styling provided in the package.\nExtracted from the installation guide:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"node_modules/primeui/themes/omega/theme.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"YOUR_PATH/font-awesome.min.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"node_modules/primeui/primeui-ng-all.min.css\" />\n. peerDependencies are Not JS exclusively, in fact, you can have in your npm-package any type of file that is needed. In this case primeui is providing javascript + css files, although primeng is not using anymore the JS files, the css styling is still necessary. peerDependencies is only saying: \"hey I need this package installed before you can use me\", no matter if it is or not a JS dependency.\nYou can see by yourself what is inside the package: https://github.com/primefaces/primeui-distribution , that's what npm will package and publish. This peerDependency can not be removed by now.\nHope to have solved your question :)\n. this is a cloned issue of: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/517 , please @Sarvesh19 consider to close this one.\n. In many cases the problem is that you are using [(ngModel)] (I know: the showcase has it like that), try to change it to: [(model)] and that should fix it. The explanation seems to be that ngModel was already defined and we can not reuse it (source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/34496633/2011421)\nLet me know if this solution suits you.\n. Yes you are right, Neither PrimeNG(beta) or Angular2(RC) are production ready by now. However you can still use them in small projects and report bugs/create pull requests so they mature faster. Keep in mind that the release date of both is still undefined (although 4th quarter of the year is probable)\n. Please refer the answer here: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/549\n. You can check other solutions that are explained, I know that some people had good results with different approaches. That depends on you configuration.\n. That's a problem with angular2 because they introduced breaking changes (even although is in ReleaseCandidate). If Ang2 keeps adding more breaking changes primeng has nothing else to do than catch up and include them.\nRemember that primeng is currently in beta and shouldn't be used on production systems. Please update (and pray for ang2 won't break in the future.)\nNote: Consider to close this issue giving that no action is needed.\n. the problem is the mangle and the -p option. Don't use them :)\njust do webpack on a project configured like:\nnew webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({\n            beautify: false,\n            mangle: false,\n            compress: {screw_ie8: true},\n            comments: false\n        })\nthis reduced vendor.js on 1/3 , not bad.\n.

As for this. you can set chartjs options via [options]=\"options\" property (http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/chart).\nAll available options are documented on the chartjs website:\nhttp://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart-data-structure\n(most likely you like to use a lineChart with {lineTension:0}).\n. Hey,\njust have a look at the showcase (http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/). There you can see, that most components (not all yet) have the option to set a style attribute. You can use it like\n[style]=\"{border:'1px solid black;'}\" or [styleClass]=\"foobar\".\nYou can find many examples there and in the code itself.\nHappy Coding :)\n. Hey,\nI had the same problem yesterday. I made a workaround by adding multiple\n<div class=\"ui-toolbar-group-left\">\n</div>\nSections to the toolbar, so that the dropdown (or MultiSelect in my Case) has it's own group.\n. This is really an angular2 related question and has nothing to do with primeNG. However, you can bind events to native Web Events using ()-Operators (e.g. <a (click)=\"foo(event)\"></a>).\nPlease think of taking the angular tutorial https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/ or other tutorials available on the web :)\n. @cagataycivici Could you maybe give some insights on this before PrimeNG goes RC? :)\n.

Such a shame as I like the simplicity of the treeTable component - but it really needs programmatic controls. Any thoughts @cagataycivici?. Thanks @cagataycivici . It would be very useful to know which of the following you test successfully for reference.\nmyTreeTable . expand (node)\nmyTreeTable . collapse (node)\nmyTreeTable . select (node)\nmyTreeTable . unselect (node)\nmyTreeTable . expandAll ()\nmyTreeTable . collapseAll ()\nEfforts much appreciated.. @cagataycivici - Thank you.

Hi @MohammedFCIS, no - I ended up not using this component at all.. I also came across this issue today and editing calendar.js file as @ilianiv proposed fixed the problem for me. Are there any plans on making these changes in the new version?\nP.S.: I am using PriemNG 2.0.0-rc.1\nP.P.S.: I just noticed that this fix works when I select data from the calendar, but when I copy the date and paste it, I still get yesterday as a result.. This issue is still not fixed in 2.0.1 - are there any plans to fix it anytime soon?. Adding utc=\"true\" helps to solve the problem when selecting the date from the calendar, but if I write it down manually or copy and paste it after selecting from input - the problem still exists. I guess you need to also add the checking for if(this.utc) to updateModel() in calendar.ts because at the moment checking for utc is implemented only in selectDate(dateMeta) method.. What is current state of this issue? Can we expect any changes anytime soon?. This would really help to wait for the bug #2795 to be fixed.. Angular: 4.4.0-RC.0\nPrimeNG: 4.2.0-rc.1\nI just tested it and setting width in html does nothing at all, no matter if it is in pixels or percents.\nHowever, adding CSS to .ui-dialog { } and using width in it works for pixels and percents.. Looks like this feature already exists and is called \"rowExpandMode\" (can be \"single\" or \"multiple\"). Too bad it's not mentioned in http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable. Still does not seem to work in 4.1.2.\nAnyone else still having the same problems, or is it just me?\nP.S.: timeout helps though.. @cagataycivici may we know your thoughts about this?. @cagataycivici are there any plans to bring this functionality back?. @kaushikparmar just try @noamichael's answer and add [lazy]=\"true\". I remember I had the same issue. Try removing (onSort).

For the sake of performance, this is only done when the reference of the value changes meaning a setter is used instead of ngDoCheck/IterableDiffers which can reduce performance.

(Will have a look into the docs later)\nhttps://angular-primeng-tableconfig-demo.stackblitz.io\nFeel free to play around, fork it, extend it, etc pp.\nSide note:\nWe got it working for our solution, but I can't post the exact code, on the one hand it's business code, and on the other hand it would be way to much to have a chance to understand it.\nIt's still quite complex and not really minimal.\nThe Visibility issues in the StackBlitz project are only there, in our solution it's working, but i can't tell why. Like I said, way more code than here, I'll try to figure it out and boil it down..\nAlso Pagination with page-size is not there and persisted now, I'll try to add that, again, it's different in our own project as we need full access to pagination (server-side-pagination) and therefore we needed to make it external, as the API through the DataTable is not nearly as large as for an isolated paginator component..\nIt doesn't feel good to add tons of \"exoskeleton\"-code to the DataTable, we didn't know how to include it. Like I said we also need server-side-features, so all filters, sort methods, data and pagination APIs would need rework, which would result in a huge PR.\nI hope the new TurboTable (nice name btw \ud83d\ude04 ) will get some of those extensions in the future.\nAlso I dont like how we are iterating over DOM-Nodes in terms of widths calculation and setting it, but that was the way it worked, so don't be too harsh on us please \ud83e\udd13 \nHope this attempt will help some of you.\nEdit:\nFound out that visibility issue is something we fixed directly in primeng but didn't pass in as Pull Request.\nPR probably wouldn't be accepted as DataTable is already deprecated.\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/app/components/datatable/datatable.ts b/src/app/components/datatable/datatable.ts\nindex 6073cc5..82fe13f 100644\n--- a/src/app/components/datatable/datatable.ts\n+++ b/src/app/components/datatable/datatable.ts\n@@ -2196,9 +2196,12 @@ export class DataTable implements AfterViewChecked,AfterViewInit,AfterContentIni\n        if(columnWidth + delta > parseInt(minWidth)) {\n            if(this.columnResizeMode === 'fit') {\n                let nextColumn = this.resizeColumn.nextElementSibling;\n+                while(nextColumn.classList.contains(\"ui-helper-hidden\")){\n+                  nextColumn = nextColumn.nextElementSibling;\n+                }\n                let nextColumnWidth = nextColumn.offsetWidth - delta;\n\nif(newColumnWidth > 15 && nextColumnWidth > 15) {\nif(nextColumn && newColumnWidth > 15 && nextColumnWidth > 15) {\n\n```.

I'm in need of the very same feature, we want to persist and load configuration in terms of rowsPerPage (or just rows as dataTable input), column order, width and visibility.\nBasically I would need a full tableState as stated in #304 , but the position attribute would be some good start for sorting the columns. \ud83d\ude03\nIterating over the columns from configuration with generic references to lots of different templates would be a huge hassle\nHope you guys are looking in one or another issue here. I love your template-driven table and would hate to switch to ag-grid or even the quite costly kendo ui, but probably they also have missing features.\nPlease Integrate those features \ud83d\ude4f \n@oixan\nFor now you could use a workaround like this: \nhtml\n<p-dataTable [value]=\"list\"  ... #dt>\n <p-column field=\"first\"></p-column>\n <p-column field=\"second\"></p-column>\n <p-column field=\"third\">\n      <ng-template let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n            <button type=\"button\" pButton (click)=\"selectCar(car)\" icon=\"fa-search\"></button>\n       </ng-template>\n </p-column>\n</p-dataTable>\njavascript\n// with \"@ViewChild('dt') dataTable: DataTable;\" at the top of your class\nngOnInit() {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    if (this.dataTable) { \n      this.dataTable.columns = this.dataTable.columns.sortBy((col: Column) => {\n        switch (col.field) {\n          case \"first\": return 2;\n          case \"second\": return 1;\n          case \"third\": return 3;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  });\n}\nThis is not very great but it works at least..\nI use similar code for persisting and loading my table configuration. It dosn't play well wenn if you define width on the columns though like \n<p-dataTable [value]=\"list\"  ... #dt>\n <p-column field=\"first\" [style]=\"{'width': '200px'}\"></p-column>\n <p-column field=\"second\"></p-column>\n <p-column field=\"third\">\n      <ng-template let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n            <button type=\"button\" pButton (click)=\"selectCar(car)\" icon=\"fa-search\"></button>\n       </ng-template>\n </p-column>\n</p-dataTable>\nI think it rerenders the columns and they lose their programmatic order again Q_Q.

    "AlejandroFlorin": "When implementing the feature, please make sure to include the sorting and paging state as well.\nI did implement a workaround for storing the filter state between page views (though not paging nor sorting). Basically:\n\nImplement a canDeactivate route guard on your component\nIn the canDeactivate handler, store the current values of the filter controls in an object in sessionStorage. You will also need to store the current value of the table's filters property\nDuring ngOnInit, check if the object exists in sessionStorage and set the values of the filter controls as well as the table's filters property to the stored values.\n\nEdit: You can also store the current page state by storing the table's first property in session and setting it during ngOnInit as well. I just implemented it and it works.. @emilwaw This is an untested trimmed down version of my code. but it should give you the idea.\nEdit: Made a couple of corrections. I missed the pagingFirstIndex in a couple of places.\nEdit2: Simplification - Turns out don't need this.pagingFirstIndex nor the onPage handler\nProvide the guard service in AppModule\n```\n//app-module.ts\nimport { DeactivateGuardService } from 'app/core/services/deactivate-guard.service';\n...\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [...],\n    imports: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...,\n        DeactivateGuardService]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nDefine the route guard:\n```\n//deativate-guard.service.ts\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CanDeactivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs/observable';\nexport interface CanComponentDeactivate {\n    canDeactivate: (\n        currentRoute: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,\n        currentState: RouterStateSnapshot,\n        nextState?: RouterStateSnapshot\n    ) => Observable | Promise | boolean;\n}\n@Injectable()\nexport class DeactivateGuardService implements CanDeactivate{\ncanDeactivate(\n    component: CanComponentDeactivate,\n    currentRoute: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,\n    currentState: RouterStateSnapshot,\n    nextState?: RouterStateSnapshot\n) {\n    return component.canDeactivate ? component.canDeactivate(currentRoute, currentState, nextState) : true;\n}\n\n}\n```\nEnable the deactivate guard service in your module's routes:\n```\n//table-state-store.module.ts\n//Angular\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n//Vendors\nimport { InputTextModule } from 'primeng/primeng';\nimport { TableModule } from 'primeng/table';\n//App\nimport { DeactivateGuardService } from \"[path]/deactivate-guard.service\";\nconst routes: Routes = [\n    {\n        path: '',\n        canDeactivate: [DeactivateGuardService],\n        component: sample_table_state_store.component.ts,\n    }\n];\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        CommonModule,\n        ReactiveFormsModule,\n        RouterModule.forChild(routes)],\n    declarations: [...],\n    exports: [...]\n})\nexport class SampleTableStateModule { }\n```\nDefine the table's data set and an interface for the object that will be stored in session:\n```\n//TableData.ts\nimport { FilterMetadata } from 'primeng/primeng';\nexport interface TableData {\n    id: number;\n    name: string;\n}\nexport interface TableState {\n    idFilter: number;\n    nameFilter: string;\n    pagingFirstIndex: number;\n    filters: {\n        [s: string]: FilterMetadata;\n    };\n}\n```\nAnd the component:\n```\n// sample_table_state_store.component.ts\n//Angular\nimport {\n    Component,\n    OnInit,\n    ViewChild\n} from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport {\n    FormBuilder,\n    FormGroup,\n    FormControl,\n    FormControlName\n} from '@angular/forms';\nimport { CanComponentDeactivate } from \"app/core/services/deactivate-guard.service\";\n//App\nimport { Data, State } from \"[path]/TableData\";\nexport class SampleTableStateStore implements\n    OnInit,\n    CanComponentDeactivate {\n@ViewChild('myTable') myTable: Table;\n\nform: FormGroup;\n\ndata: Data[]\n\nget idFilter(): FormControl {\n    return this.form.get('idFilter') as FormControl;\n}\nget nameFilter(): FormControl {\n    return this.form.get('nameFilter') as FormControl;\n}\n\nconstructor() {\n    this.form = this.fb.group({\n        idFilter: [''],\n        nameFilter: ['']\n}\n\nngOnInit() {\n\n    let tableState = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('TableState')) as TableState;\n\n    if (tableState) {\n        this.idFilter.setValue(tableState.id);\n        this.nameFilter.setValue(tableState.name);\n        this.myTable.filters = tableState.filters;\n        this.myTable.first = tableState.pagingFirstIndex;\n    }\n}\n\ncanDeactivate() {\n\n    sessionStorage.setItem(\n        'TableState',\n        JSON.stringify(\n            {\n                id: this.idFilter.value,\n                name: this.nameFilter.value,\n                pagingFirstIndex: this.myTable.first,\n                filters: this.myTable.filters\n            } as TableState)\n    );\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n//rest of the component code, including filling the table Data array\n    ...\n}\n```. I implemented it using Session Storage as we didn't need it to persist between browser sessions but local storage gives devs the most options as they can clear it on logout if they want. A service would lose state between browser windows so that would be the most restrictive. I vote Local Storage since it is the most flexible IMO.. State retention of filter entry controls does not work. State retention of the currently selected Page DOES work. I haven't tested sorting.\nI'm using the recently released 7.0.0 production version\nNot sure if it makes a difference but the headings and columns on my table are manually defined (not dynamically built) and the filter controls are bound using model driven form (formcontrolname = ...). @wombll. Thank but I'm using paging, lazyloading and model driven controls and it isn't clear how to use the State feature with those. I can see the state information being stored in sessionStorage for the table's defined session key but the onlazyload event is not using it consistently. I'm going to post a question on the forums to see if I can get a working sample with lazyloading and model driven controls using the new state feature.. After I posted on the primeng forums, I realized that I was expecting a bit too much from the new functionality. It basically just provides a built in session object with automatic storage during the onDeactivate event. Though that makes sense after thinking about it. I wound up using the same technique as I had before for lazy loaded pages and model driven controls but just using the built in session object.  Here is my post with my code in case it helps anyone:\nhttps://forum.primefaces.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=57640&p=172030#p172030. +1 for this feature. It would be nice if we could use the other flexbox alignment options with the grid system (horizontal and vertical alignment, etc.). Doesn't work with drop downs. I don't understand this.\n\"this.options\" refers to what? In the docs, the list box [options] points to the cities array. After changing the array with a new, altered or deleted item, how do you \"provide a new reference\" to get the list box to display the changes?\nEDIT:\nI get it. The sample code here and in the docs is wrong, it should read like this:\n```\n//fails\n this.cities.push({name:'New York', code: 'NY'});\n//correct\nthis.cities = [...this.cities, {name:'New York', code: 'NY'}];\n```. I get this error (using 5.2.6) if I try to display a dialog when the value of a p-dropdown changes. It works fine if using a button to flip the display flag.\nNote that I don't get the error if I break into and step through the onChange function.\n```\n\n        ...\n\n\n\nonChange(value: string) {\n    this.display = true;\n}\n```\n. Same issue. But it is inconsistent. It happens with some controls but not others. Also happens with other filter types (int, num, etc.) I haven't found why yet.. ",
    "umdstu": "@cagataycivici  What does it mean that this was removed from the milestone/version again?\nThanks!. When I implemented this with angularjs's ui-grid, I used localStorage. My customers want their states to be there when they come back another day. sessionStorage is simply too short lived for this kind of thing.  And technically if you used localStorage, you could also use an expiration date kinda deal, so the developer could choose how long it's stored. But that's not really common i'd guess. That said, the option/ability to store this server-side would also be nice, via a provided callback of some sort.\nJust my .02 cents.. As part of this, would it make sense to add a new supported state to the table, specifically column visibility? Right now it's only possible by ngIf'ing the column. If one were to add a way for users to hide columns (outside of p-table), there would likely not be a way to pass that into whatever state is saved as it stands.. I haven't had a chance to test this yet, but based on comments above, it looks like this doesn't support visibility of columns? aka. you'd have to track them outside of this state management functionality, then merge in as necessary. Kinda lame :( Is this something on the todo list @cagataycivici ?. @cagataycivici Can you elaborate on how your patch fixes this? The above fix from i0natan doesn't work. Setting .ui-table-scrollable-header to overflow:auto instead of overflow:hidden allows you scroll the header when there are no rows, but as soon as you add a row, you now have two horizontal scroll-bars.. @cagataycivici - Are you planning on adding this to the new TreeTable? If so, what version? Thank you!. @cagataycivici Just to clarify- this won't be 'fixed' other than the suggested message display?. Is there an ETA/release for this to happen then @cagataycivici ?. I too would also appreciate this. I use the treetable for an actual directory tree. With the current implementation, selecting a file, or all immediate child files for a 'directory', the list of selected files includes an entry for each name of the parent nodes, which is kind of silly.\nMy current work-around is to filter the array of Selected TreeNodes to remove those that are 'parents', as well as using CSS to style 'parent' nodes in the tree so that they do not look selected.\nHowever, the code above seems dated. When reviewing where this would be possible it seemed likely it would be done in the toggleNodeWithCheckbox() function, specifically, around line 1050:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/components/treetable/treetable.ts#L1050\nHappy to attempt this myself if open to PRs.\nThanks\nAngular 6.1.9\nPrimeNG 6.1.2. You need to specify a dataKey that lets treetable know how to uniquely identify one of your rows. As it stands you dont have enough information in your tree to uniquely identify a row. I would recommend adding a 'path' field to your data and using that as your dataKey. See https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/treetable. ",

How it behaves when style param is not defined? Do I need to specify style.width everytime I want to use dropdown component?\nCould you please provide an example of usage? Thank you.. @ARandomDude please upgrade to v5.2.1 and use metaKeySelection option (boolean, set it to true). Example available here: https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/selection. @wz2b You can bind click event on tr element in table.\nhtml\n<p-table [columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"cars\">\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\" let-columns>\n        <tr>\n            <th *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{col.header}}\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n        <tr (click)=\"onRowClick($event, rowData)\">   <!-- like this -->\n            <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                    {{rowData[col.field]}}\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n</p-table>. I've checked documentation and there stays:\n\nBy default each row click adds or removes the row from the selection, if you prefer a classic metaKey based selection approach enable metaKeySelection true so that multiple selection or unselection of a row requires metaKey to be pressed. Note that, on touch enabled devices, metaKey based selection is turned off automatically as there is no metaKey in devices such as mobile phones.\n\nDoes it solve your issue?\n\nIt was fixed by this commit: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/e1f7bef0dcf7a18ed229d709b3258ca1a5b1d389 and therefore it's available in the latest version (v5.2.1).. @andreeapNRO please check https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/selection. EDIT: I've just checked documentation for row expansion and here's my suggestion:\nhtml\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-expanded=\"expanded\" let-columns=\"columns\">\n    <tr [pRowToggler]=\"rowData\"> <----- add [pRowToggler] to row (and you can keep it as expander icon as well)\n        <td>\n            <a href=\"#\" [pRowToggler]=\"rowData\">\n                <i [ngClass]=\"expanded ? 'fa fa-fw fa-chevron-circle-down' : 'fa fa-fw fa-chevron-circle-right'\"></i>\n            </a>\n        </td>\n        <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n            {{rowData[col.field]}}\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</ng-template>\n\nORIGINAL: Turbo Table is more template oriented, so basically you can bind click event directly on your row. For example:\nhtml\n<p-table [columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"cars\" [paginator]=\"true\" [rows]=\"10\">\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\" let-columns>\n        <tr>\n            <th *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{col.header}}\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n        <tr (click)=\"onRowClick(rowData)\"> <------ here you can attach click event listener\n            <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\">\n                {{rowData[col.field]}}\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n</p-table>\nor you can try to use onRowSelect event on table (but I haven't tested it yet and from my point of view it has different meaning).. it should be fixed in the newest version: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5285 (showClear should be false by default). You can enable core-js polyfill in angular-cli project:\n- open src/polyfills.ts\n- add line import 'core-js/es7/array';. Hey @ericrovtar, from my point of view is good to use new language features if they can be polyfilled for older browsers. You can import only stuff you really need, so it won't increase bundle size so much.. onLazyLoad is also triggered multiple times when sortField and sortMode are specified.\nFor example, I parse state of application from URL query parameters to variable state in component, because router is my single source of truth.\nComponent's template looks like this:\nhtml\n<p-table [value]=\"items\"\n         [rows]=\"state.pageSize\"\n         [first]=\"state.pageOffset\"\n         [sortMode]=\"'single'\"\n         [sortField]=\"state.sortField\"\n         [sortOrder]=\"state.sortOrder\"\n         [rowsPerPageOptions]=\"[10, 20, 50]\"\n         [paginator]=\"true\"\n         [lazy]=\"true\"\n         [totalRecords]=\"totalCount\"\n         [responsive]=\"true\"\n         (onLazyLoad)=\"onLazyLoad($event)\"\n         class=\"break-word table-columns-auto-width\"\n         [rowHover]=\"true\">\n.\n.\n.\n</p-table>\nTable has multiple sortable columns (e.g createdAt, updatedAt...).\nOn first load, state.sortField and state.sortOrder are null.\nThen user clicks on column header to sort results by this column.\nClick triggers sort() which triggers sortSingle() and therefore onLazyLoad.\nWhat we do in onLazyLoad is simple redirect to same page, with updated query parameters.\nNew values from query parameters are set to state variable and this causes change of sortField and sortOrder inputs on TurboTable. These inputs are implemented as setters. Each of setters calls sortSingle() which triggers onLazyLoad.\nSo, sort triggered by user (click) results in 3 onLazyLoad events.\nFrom my point of view, setters should call sortSingle() only if new value differs from internal sort field/order.. or even better, it shouldn't trigger events at all (for all inputs) in lazy mode.\nI would say, that our usecase is typical for other developers which use redux/ngrx architecture as well.. @cagataycivici what do you think?. This is critical for us, because we load initial data in route guard and we cannot use non-lazy mode due to server-side pagination/sorting. It results in duplicate load call.. +1. Also, expanded row is now marked as \"even\", therefore row striping is different. I'm not sure if it is a good or bad thing.. Fixed in #6520.

In future whether we can have such components in Primeng ?. This component will be very useful, instead of pop up window we can use this. Currently, we are using ng-office UI slide bar in AngularJS but in Angular 2 we don't have such component. . Thanks a lot for your hard work and looks awesome.\nCan we have properties like small, medium, large and according to that we can have a size of the panel?. @cagataycivici I am after those features mentioned above !!! Thanks, guys.. In the expandable or Tree grid, i would like to show the Invoice Header and Invoice Details. Parent is the Invoice header and Child is the Invoice detail. Invoice header columns will be different and Invoice details columns will be different, how can I declare those columns in the expandable grid or Tree grid. During runtime, I would like to bind the image to the invoice details rorws or bind click events to the rows.. Similar like Angular Material Progress spinner but i love Netflix progress spinner.\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/progress-spinner/overview. Thanks a lot of and I hope I am little dependent on Angular Material. PrimeNG going to fulfill almost all my required angular components !!!. @gsteiner89 Thanks for sharing, looks good.. @cagataycivici any idea when we get these features? Please, give these awesome features.. Please browse the below URL\nhttps://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible. @sudheerj I am missing Expandable grid, UI-GRID has got separate columns for the child grid and during run time we can assign click events. . @sudheerj  The save state feature allows you to save the current look of the grid and restore it upon returning to the grid. Please check the screenshot below, header can different columns and details can have different columns. During run time i can assign image according to the document type and assign click events during run time.\n\n\n. Awesome guys, please add features like ag-grid.. Can't wait for this!! Thanks guys for your contribution.. This should be like p-autocomplete field property, dropdown also should have field or label and value property. . Please refer this.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/261. @michaelsampietro you saved my day.. Can we able to assign ICON or Image for the marker? Similar to Circle, Polyline. \nMy requirement is based on the Property type e.g. Commercial, Hospital I have to place the marker with different ICON.. Please provide focus method for dropdown, multiselect components also.. > Maybe this example help you\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rzu7rt?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\nThanks, I need parent and child columns should be different, your example having the same column names for parent and child rows.. @yigitfindikli Please reopen this new feature, I am waiting for a long time. For reference please check the below link.\nhttp://ui-grid.info/docs/#!/tutorial/Tutorial:%20216%20Expandable%20grid.

I already forked and cloned the repo and my setup is working. My doubts are;\n1. are we working on a single branch \"master\"\n2. Do i need to create any hotfix or branch?\n. @cagataycivici  the issue is with 12 hourformat. I will test it with new version and resolve the conflict for the new version. The main issue is some thing like if you choose an hour more than 12 in the edit input it should throw an error instead it gives a valida date with the time of 12:00. Other is if you change the date in the edit field when the time is in \"PM\" and you changed the hour to 12 it will switch to AM in UI and not updating the edit field. \nIf the date in edit field is wrong it should throw an error instead of a valid date.. @cagataycivici the conflict has been resolved. \nThe major issue is ,the user edit the hour of the time to 12 when the time is in PM it's automatically changes to AM . Actually there is no 12:30 AM. Once its past 12 , its become 00:30. Or else it should throw an invalid date. And also when an hour changed to greater than 12 it should throw an invalid date, since its an 12 hour format. \n. I will update and fix it with latest one and initiate new pull request..

Search mode should be configurable. I'm personally don't need search at all. The most worst thing is the growing of the select field when you choose more and more items.

We developed an own multiselect which shows ... (ellipses) at the end when more items are available.\n. Created all three issues listed above.. Aha, thanks for clarification. But peerDependencies is for JS modules. AFAIK, you can not really have CSS modules. That means, we can delete peerDependencies without drawbacks. Maybe I have missunderstood you.\n. Ah ok, I overlooked this CSS dependency. Closed the issue.\n. Solution is here #2757. I have found some other weak points in the ConfirmDialog.\n\nConfirmation object doesn't need to expose acceptEvent and rejectEvent because they are not used public. You can keep these references in the Component ConfirmDialog itself.\nSubscription like this.confirmation.acceptEvent.subscribe(...) should be unsubscribed when accept() resp. reject are called. There is unsubscribe() on the return object of subscribe(). See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36494509/how-to-unsubscribe-from-eventemitter-in-angular-2 If you keep the references in the Component, you can call unsubscribe() in the destroy method.\nDon't use EventEmitter except for properties decorated with @Output. It's not recommended. Use Observable or Subject. You can read that in some docs. See the stackoverflow post I have mentioned above. Background: Angular will never guarantee us that EventEmitter will continue being an Observable.. @cagataycivici I have created a PR for weak points: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/3201 It looks cleaner now. The issue on close was already fixed earlier.\n\nThanks. Oleg.. Yes, the original issue is fixed by #921. This PR fixes weak points I mentioned in \"I have found some other weak points in the ConfirmDialog.\". It's disappointing that PR has conflicts now. Why do we need this.executePostShowActions? Can we not always set focus on first button in the confirm dialog?. I've solved conflicts. No problem. You can merge the PR.. Oh, just found this duplicate issue https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2243. Just FYI. Http service supports FormData. Here is a gist: https://gist.github.com/Toxicable/1c736ed16c95bcdc7612e2c406b5ce0f I suggest to use the service, even your own one, so that we can always overwrite it with providers. This is useful for extensions, mocking, demos, etc.. I've tried some workarounds like cloning the values and setting new reference for value - nothing works.. Yeah, this did the trick \ud83d\udc4d I added an id property to the model and ended with this impl.:\n// add draggable element to the deleted documents list \nthis.deletedDocs = [...this.deletedDocs, this.draggedDoc];\n// remove draggable element from the available documents list\nthis.availableDocs = this.availableDocs.filter((e: Document) => e.id !== this.draggedDoc.id);\nthis.draggedDoc = null;\nWe should mention this behavior in the book indeed :-) I guess you will get some questions in the forum too.

The book is safe :-). @Mrtcndkn @cagataycivici Do you know the approx. release date of PrimeNG 4.1?. Cool component. We have a full page overlay variant in our project (called it lightbox).. Cool. The next topic for PrimeNG's book, second edition -:).\nCan we do the sidebar responsive? I mean a \"full screen\" mode on small screens, like Angular Material Dialog.. Sidebar gets not closed on ESC key. @cagataycivici: is it possible to implement this behavior like in Dialog?. Thanks. I can not see this in the last commits.. +1\nI hate outdated float based layout too. For now, we can use Flexbox in Bootstrap 4.

No idea! But I made a pull request so we can only wait and see!\n. You can just get the Autocomplete instance (using ViewChild), then access the focus method itself\n. First just get the AutoComplete instance like this:\n@ViewChild(AutoComplete) private autoComplete: AutoComplete;\nThen just call this function when you want to focus it:\nthis.autoComplete.input.focus().

I was using 2.x, when I needed to use 4.0.0-rc.x.. Does this mean that I can use the async pipe as the following example shows?\n```typescript\nexport class DemoComponent implements OnInit {\n  public items: Observable<{ label: string, value: string }[]>;\n  constructor(private http: Http) { }\nngOnInit() {\n    this.items = this.http.get('some/url/that/returns/items').map(response => response.json());\n  }\n}\n```\nhtml\n<p-dropdown [options]=\"items | async\"></p-dropdown>\nI'm trying that, but it doesn't seem to work. I'm using primeng version 2.0.3.. Nevermind, I must have been doing something wrong. The async pipe works great!. I have found that it's not really a limitation having to use the SelectItem interface. You can use a pipe to transform the data. For example:\n```typescript\ninterface Person {\n  firstName: string;\n  lastName: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n@Pipe({ name: 'toSelectItem' })\nclass ToSelectItemPipe implements PipeTransform {\npublic transform(people: Person[]): SelectItem[] {\n    if (!people) return undefined;\n    return people.map(p => ({ label: p.firstName + ' ' + p.lastName, value: p.id }));\n  }\n}\nconst people= [\n  { firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Jones', id: 1 },\n  { firstName: 'Mary', lastName: 'Robinson', id: 2 },\n  { firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Smith', id: 3 },\n  { firstName: 'Suzy', lastName: 'Sorenson', id: 4 }\n];\nhtml\n\n```\n. Sorry, I've been meaning to get back to you. You can already do what you want. This works, for example:\n```typescript\ninterface Person {\n  firstName: string;\n  lastName: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n// An intersection type that combines Person and SelectItem.\ntype PersonSelectItem = Person & SelectItem;\n@Pipe({ name: 'toSelectItem' })\nclass ToSelectItemPipe implements PipeTransform {\npublic transform(people: Person[]): PersonSelectItem[] {\n    if (!people) return undefined;\n// Create an object that has all of the Person properties AND the SelectItem properties.\nreturn people.map(p => Object.assign({ }, p, { label: p.firstName + ' ' + p.lastName, value: p.id });\n\n}\n}\nconst people= [\n  { firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Jones', id: 1 },\n  { firstName: 'Mary', lastName: 'Robinson', id: 2 },\n  { firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Smith', id: 3 },\n  { firstName: 'Suzy', lastName: 'Sorenson', id: 4 }\n];\nhtml\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n{{person.firstName}}\n  <dt>Last Name</dt>\n  <dd>{{person.lastName}}</dd>\n</dl>\n\n\n\n``. @JohnnyHandsaw I see your point. Because we're creating the options on the fly in the pipe, we're not holding onto a reference. So if the user changes thevalue, it won't be reflected in thePersonobject (in my example). You could probably work around that by using a getter/setter for thevalue` like so:\nts\n// Create an object that has all of the Person properties AND the SelectItem properties.\nreturn people.map(p => Object.assign({ }, p, {\n  label: p.firstName + ' ' + p.lastName,\n  get value() {\n    return p.id;\n  },\n  set value(newValue) {\n    p.id = newValue;\n  }\n});\nI haven't tried that yet, but something like that should work.\n@mdonato7 I made almost exactly those changes you're asking for. The only difference is that I called the attributes labelKey and valueKey. My pull request is 2702. However, I wasn't sure if PrimeNG would accept it because of their policy of not accepting new features from the community, plus I found out I could use a pipe. So I ended up declining my own pull request. If enough people wanted it, maybe I could try resubmitting it.. Closing this because I can accomplish the same thing with a pipe.. @PrajAmit  I cancelled this pull request because I found I can already do everything I need. See the discussion in #2565.. I discovered that this pull request is not needed. I can accomplish the same thing using a pipe.. I can submit a pull request for this. Is the PrimeNG team willing to accept one?. @Mrtcndkn Thanks for getting back to me. The issue boils down to this block of code inside the parseValue method:\nts\nif(val.trim() === '') {\n  value= this.min !== undefined ? this.min : null;\n}\nI personally find it surprising that if the min were 5, for example, then if the text box is empty, the underlying model would be set to 5. So I would like to change it to this:\nts\nif(val.trim() === '') {\n  value= null;\n}\nHowever, that would be a breaking change. So do you think I should add a new flag as an attribute (e.g. [nullIfEmpty]=\"true\")? Then the code would look like this:\nts\nif(val.trim() === '') {\n  value= (!this.nullIfEmpty && this.min !== undefined) ? this.min : null;\n}\nBottom line: Do I need a flag or not?. ",

One, or fewer basic modules with orthogonal, combinable and consistent features would be much more powerful in the long run.. Seems like this issue reappeared. The corresponding code has been completely reworked and I cannot find anything resembling the logic that was introduced to fix this issue.. This sounds related to my own issue, though I am not quite sure:\nDoes the getData input that you describe actually exist? Or is this the proposal that you make?\nIn any case: I also want to use PrimNG with immutable.js data structures (in my case with DataTable), but however I try this, I cannot get it to work. Anyhow, I am not quite sure yet, whether fully understand the situation at all.. Setting scrollHeight to a percentage is definitely broken, but thinking about it, I am not even sure how it should behave:\nSpecifying an absolute scrollHeight defines the size of the scrollable area and then adds some more non-scrollable content to it. Doing the same with a relative scrollHeight does not make much sense.\nInstead, what you typcially want to do is to specify the total size of the table (via style=height:) and then define the number of frozen rows at the top. For that, introducing a new attribute like frozenRows would be more appropriate than attempting to fix the behavior of scrollHeight. This attribute should then, of course, activate vertical scrolling without a specified scrollHeight, simply honoring the style-height attribute of the whole table.. After more tweaking, I found a workaround that offers exactly what I need. Adding only the scrollable=\"true\" attribute (no scrollHeight) and then the following styles to the surrounding component:\nstyles: [`\n  * >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable-wrapper {\n    height:100%\n  }\n\n  * >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable-view {\n    height: 100%;\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n  }\n\n  * >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable-body {\n    flex: 1 1 0;\n  }\n`]\n\nI am not sure whether flexbox is mature enough to be used in primeng when integrating a solution into datatable. I am only targeting Chrome (via electron), so browser compatibility is not an issue for me.... An even better workaround that also works correctly in the presence of p-header:\n* >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n* >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable-wrapper {\n  flex: 1 1 0;\n}\n\n* >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable-view {\n  height: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n* >>> .ui-datatable-scrollable-body {\n  flex: 1 1 0;\n}\n\n.

But it is possible to put it into a different module than app.module right?!\nI put it into a module keeping ui stuff together so we do not need to import everything, because the app.module grows steadily enough.\n```import {NgModule} from \"@angular/core\";\nimport {CommonModule} from \"@angular/common\";\nimport {BrowserAnimationsModule} from \"@angular/platform-browser/animations\";\nimport {DataTableModule} from \"primeng/primeng\";\nimport {CheckboxModule} from \"primeng/primeng\";\nimport {ButtonModule} from \"primeng/primeng\";\nimport {CalendarModule} from \"primeng/primeng\";\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        CommonModule,\n        BrowserAnimationsModule,\n        DataTableModule,\n        CheckboxModule,\n        ButtonModule,\n        CalendarModule\n    ],\n    declarations: [],\n    exports: [\n        DataTableModule,\n        CheckboxModule,\n        ButtonModule,\n        CalendarModule\n    ]\n})\nexport class AppPrimeNGModule { }\nand then import this module into app.module.... @sudheerj your code does not work.\nYour spread operator usage is wrong, this works:\nprivate showGrowl(growlMessage: Message) {\nthis.growlMessages = [this.growlMessages, ...growlMessage];\n}\nNOTE: this looks nice, but it does not work, just like the other spread operation...\n@quahkj \nI wonder how this fixed your problem :D. @chlupaccom yea, damn. I didn't see that the growl opens a very small empty growl above due to the false result :(\nI remember the growls working as expected when I .push() a message in, but now it doesnt work anymore, it just keeps sticky no matter what config.\n. @chlupaccom if i use your slice code, and all messages have disappeared, and i initiate a new message => all past (already vanished) messages show additionally to the new one.... Damn...First, the lead dev said \"make em sticky\" and I said \"ok\" and they were sticky. Then he said \"oh man, it sucks so much if they are sticky\" and I said \"ok, but it doesn't work anymore with sticky=false\"\n:D. Yes that is very frustrating, maybe we are going to use the ngx-flash-messages too...\nThanks for the hint!. You can also concat, which also results in old vanished messages being displayed again:\nthis.growlMessages = this.growlMessages.concat(growlMessage);. You should also set a min-height.... Did you set the event-listeners inside the DataTable?\n<p-dataTable\n            ......\n            [editable]=\"true\"\n            (onEditComplete)=\"onEditComplete($event)\"\n            (onEditCancel)=\"onEditCancel($event)\"\n            (onEditInit)=\"onEditInit($event)\">\nAnd [editable]=\"true\" inside the p-column?\nI cannot reproduce your issue on IE11 and Chrome@latest...\nEverything is working as expected, except for no event is fired if the fieldUnderEdit is losing focus.. The code handling the keydown strokes emits a blur event:\nif (event.keyCode == 13) {\n                this.onEditComplete.emit({ column: column, data: rowData, index: rowIndex });\n                this.domHandler.invokeElementMethod(event.target, 'blur');\n                this.switchCellToViewMode(event.target);\n                event.preventDefault();\n            }\n            else if (event.keyCode == 27) {\n                this.onEditCancel.emit({ column: column, data: rowData, index: rowIndex });\n                this.domHandler.invokeElementMethod(event.target, 'blur');\n                this.switchCellToViewMode(event.target);\n                event.preventDefault();\n            }\nI tried to override this behavior by using my own edit template (only need this for one column/string), but it is more than just using the already implemented event emitters.\nAs i need only one cell to be editable, i can pretty easily hold a backup for this one chunk of data...\n```\n onEditInit($event) {\n        this.descriptionToEdit = UtilsService.getCloneFromObject($event.data.description);\n    }\nonEditCancel($event) {\n    $event.data.description = this.descriptionToEdit ? UtilsService.getCloneFromObject(this.descriptionToEdit) : \"\";\n    this.descriptionToEdit = \"\";\n}\n\n```\nBut the blur event will never save nor reset the field-data if i do not want to re-implement some functionality of the DataTable.\n. For using an own template, you must emit these events in the wrapped input\nfor example.\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"editor\" let-row=\"rowData\">\n    <input ... (blur)=\"onBlur({$event: $event, data: row})\" ...other\nevents.../>\n</ng-template>\nIf you want to reimplement or make a pull request with a fix, you should\ncheck out how it is handled inside of the DataTable class. It also includes\nsetting back to view mode after edit for example.\n. For me, this still persists when handing an array into a p-dataTable with a banana box:\n[(value)]=\"arrayVariable.someType\"\nwhere the arrayVariable is fetched async.. Declare the date with a type:\npublic myDateObject: Date;. I think for me it was caused by the DataTable not being initialized properly due to *ngIf=\"myTableDataArray\" set either on the #globalFilter wrapping div and/or on the <p-dataTable...-Element (myTableDataArray being filled by async XHR)!\nRemoving those *ngIfs solved the problem, and the @Input() globalFilter field contains the <input #globalFilter object again!! :)\n(To make it clear: before the primeNG update the @Input() globalFilter field contained the <input...-object - no matter about the *ngIfs or async XHR...)\nEDIT: if i only add an *ngIf=\"!hideSortField\" to the <div... wrapping the <input #globalFilter..., the @Input() globalFilter inside the DataTable is undefined.\nMy Solution was to remove the *ngIfs and use [ngClass]=\"{'<classWithDisplayNone>': !myTableDataArray}. I think, your problem is the other way round:\nI bet your globalFilter field object is initialized, and the @Input globalFilter contains the correct object, but the filter does not find your values due to the ngIfs...\n(maybe)\nCheck the DataTables ngOnInit, if there is an undefined this.globalFilter or if it is defined.... I got to add: I really need the ngIf=\"array\" because the DataTable crashes if i do not use it and the array is empty (it is filled async).\nSo I have to give up on the filtering functionality :(\n(maybe using lazy tables everywhere would fix the problem - but unfortunately i cannot do that). removed any ngif to check if it is still not working?\nAm 04.09.2017 21:22 schrieb \"Bilal Haidar\" notifications@github.com:\n\nIn my case, I have really a very basic datatable.

    "variable-content": "Can this be added to the V2 milestone? Would help reduce bundle sizes for most apps. Also reduces risk upgrading one component without having to retest all other components.. Using https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/ - primeng is 696kb (raw), for comparison @angular/core is 367.9kb. For my app, I only need to use 3 primeng components, totaling 90kb. primeng has a large number of components to choose from (which is great!!) but it would be great if we could only reference the ones that are used within our app.. That reduces the bundle size massively, thanks! Docs should use that convention instead of the full import so everyone gets a smaller bundle by default.. A quick test that I did using the Chrome profiler showed that this line:\nthis.domHandler.scrollInView(this.itemsWrapper, this.domHandler.findSingle(this.panel, 'li.ui-state-highlight'));\nwithin ngAfterViewChecked was responsible for the vast majority of the render time.\nAfter removing that line and turning off autoWidth on the dropdown render times are much better.. Finally, only rendering the ui-dropdown-items ul list when the panel is visible makes it really snappy when there's a large list of items.\ni.e. changing:\n<ul class=\"ui-dropdown-items ui-dropdown-list ui-widget-content ui-widget ui-corner-all ui-helper-reset\">\nto:\n<ul *ngIf=\"panelVisible\" class=\"ui-dropdown-items ui-dropdown-list ui-widget-content ui-widget ui-corner-all ui-helper-reset\">.

Thanks @cagataycivici, appreciate you taking a look.\nCan you go into a bit more detail as to why accessibility can't be disabled via an input property?

    "fis-dan-wnuk": "Ah, you are correct. I'll close my issue.\n. On another note - the two event listeners in ContextMenu are listening on the body. Can they be changed to instead listen on the document? The reason I ask is because the application I am working on has the body centered with margin: 0 auto;. Clicking on the margin doesn't trigger a click event on the body - so essentially half the page does not cancel the right click menu.\n. The displaying of context menu regardless of where the right click occurs also means that when you right click on a table when there are multiple tables on the page with context menus, then one context menu is displayed for each table.\n. I opened an issue for this as well back in May - #413 - anyone know if this is on the dev teams radar?\nI know I could format the data prior to passing it into the datatable, but would prefer to go this route if possible. It would nice to be know if/when this is planned to be supported so that I could know if I need to spend time working around it.. I'm not sure that those changes will address the issue I'm reporting.  That looks like they are adding additional components as alternatives to the text box - so you could put a dropdown instead of a text box for the filter field. But I would like to keep the text box, but instead of filtering on the value in the object, it would filter on the value that is rendered in the column.\nIt seems like there should be some event they can use to trigger storing a collection of the rows and their rendered values for each column, and use that collection when filtering.. I have the same issue. I have a form that has a start date and end date. I am trying to use minDate and maxDate to make sure start date can't be chosen before end date, and vice versa.\nBut when I set the date in the start date field, and then open the calendar for the end date field, all the values for the current month are still available.

    "RebelSyntax": "works now\n. appendTo=\"body\"\n@rohitsindhu90 nailed it. Seems like that style is for everything I need to use.  Kind of interesting considering later on in the template you have something like this going on for a ui-dropdown-panel class.  z-index: 1001?  hmmm....what's going on here?\nelement.style {\n    display: block;\n    visibility: visible;\n    top: 20px;\n    left: 0px;\n    z-index: 1001;\n    opacity: 1;\n}. I experienced the same issue too.  Was plaguing me.  What I ended up realizing (not sure if this is bug or feature of angular) is that change detection was looking at my child component the p-datatable and seeing the value as undefined.  Since I used square bracket databinding to set the datatable value in the template, my tests were failing.  To be clear, I didn't experience this issue outside of unit testing, but tests failing here killed my code coverage requirement. \nLong story short, what I ended up doing was getting hold of the child datatable object with @ViewChild(dt) datatable:DataTable.  Then, inside of my lazy load call back, I set the datatable.value property to my lazy loaded object.   Voila', worked like a charm.  My dev and prod build still worked, and seemed snappier to boot.  Also code coverage requirement is complete.  \nIf I have time, I will set up a minimal repro.  Like I said, not sure if this is a bug in primeng or just a feature of angular that suffered my inability to use the square bracket template syntax as expected.\nI also wonder if there is a bug in angular that prevented that expression has changed error message from firing outside of unit test. . @StevenLiekens Funny thing, when I had this problem, I didn't see it even in dev builds.  Only came up in testing when trying to mock data held in p-datatable [value]= attribute.  \nI just grabbed a reference to the @ViewChild of the datatable in my component using a template variable and then at the end of my lazy load call chain (after lazy paging, lazy filtering, lazy sorting customizations)  I set datatable.value to my new object array returned by my lazy chain functions.  No more expression has changed problems in ng test. . @StevenLiekens you are right, that is something that I definitely looked at in my test cases.   So it could just be my misunderstanding of the data flow in the testbed.  That said, I am not mocking the backend call, just using Observables to control what data is presented to the component at various points in testing.\nBeing aware of the async issue you mentioned in advanced and not wanting to wire up mock backend, I tried timeouts, tick, and async observeables.  I assume I just did not get it right if the case is as you say an async issue in the test (which makes perfect sense as well).  \nNow I feel more compelled to wire up the mock backend and revert my component change that \"fixed\" the test to see if I have positive results. \nI feel like I have a good handle on the component data flow and how angular handles change detection as well as the lifecycle hooks.  I definitely realized right away that lazy load needs to happen after AfterViewInit.  As I mentioned, I did not cross this error in dev or prod builds, it's just a problem for me in testing. \nI feel this still may be some buggy nature in the lazy load functionality, but there is some question also in the cli discussion that this may be some bug in angular that used to exist that hid the problem.  Once that bug was resolved angular supposedly started acting like it should with not suppressing this error. \nIt's definitely an issue that needs more documentation for both testing and dev/prod builds.  \nI am perfectly fine with grabbing reference to 3rd party child component (p-datatable) and manipulating the object inside of the component code rather than the template syntax.  I do it anyways with my custom filters/sorts/paging etc.   I am comfortable in my understanding of the view encapsulation that occurs with angular components/child components and templates/css.\nThe solution I came up with just feels like better code and definitely became more testable without having to wire up a much more verbose test harness.  \nStill worth playing around with to gain deeper insight into the primeng plugin and how interaction occurs with angular.  \nThanks for you comments!\n.

I feel like this is the wrong way to theme it. Typically it's base styles, then theme styles. This allows you to easily override styles as intended in CSS..

So I figured out why it's doing this and how to solve it (at least my way). The reason (I think) it does this is because the ColumnBodyTemplateLoader directive is recycled by the ngFor parent directive. So, the child directive needs to watch for changes and updated the view's context accordingly. This is the working code:\n@Component({\n    selector: 'p-columnBodyTemplateLoader',\n    template: ``\n})\nexport class ColumnBodyTemplateLoader {\n@Input() column: any;\n\n@Input() rowData: any;\n\n@Input() rowIndex: number;\n\ncontext: any;\n\nconstructor(public viewContainer: ViewContainerRef) {}\n\nngOnChanges() {\n    if (this.context) {\n        this.context.rowData = this.rowData;\n        this.context.rowIndex = this.rowIndex;\n    }\n}\n\nngOnInit() {\n    this.context = {\n        '\\$implicit': this.column,\n        'rowData': this.rowData,\n        'rowIndex': this.rowIndex\n    };\n    let view = this.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.column.bodyTemplate, this.context);\n};\n\n}.

The event is only called in onCellEditorKeydown. . For me it doesn't work because I'm using an edit template. But I don't need this functionality right now so I won't open a ticket yet.. @brian428  You can call the onCellEditorKeydown function in your custom template like so:\n<input type=\"number\" class=\"ui-inputtext ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all\"\n                                       [(ngModel)]=\"rowData[col.field]\" [ngModelOptions]=\"{standalone:true}\"\n                                       (keydown)=\"dt.onCellEditorKeydown($event, col, rowData, rowIndex)\" />\n\n. You have to declare it, like so:\n<p-dataTable #dt [value]=\"dataRows\">.... @gabrielalack Add an event handler for the blur event and call onEditComplete then. See my code snippet above.. @a-kolybelnikov\n\nSorry I didn't paste the code for the blur event. The blur event has to be handled differently than the click event because the DataTable is looking for certain keys pressed to trigger the update (I think it's keyCode 13). What I did was call a function in my component that calls dt.onCellEditorKeydown with a custom object instead of $event. My custom object looks like a key press event object, like this:\n{\n    keyCode: 13,\n    target: event.target // may have to find the correct target\n  }\nTake a look at the source of the DataTable code to see what it's doing. This will help you determine what you need to do to trigger it.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/components/datatable/datatable.ts\nHope this helps :)\n. @a-kolybelnikov \nCorrect, the element in the template would fire my function on blur and then call the onCellEditorKeydown function in the DataTAble. I didn't test this, but something like this:\n<input type=\"number\" class=\"ui-inputtext ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all\"\n                                   [(ngModel)]=\"rowData[col.field]\" [ngModelOptions]=\"{standalone:true}\"\n                                   (blur)=\"dataTableOnBlur($event, col, rowData, rowIndex, dt)\" />\n\nclass MyComponent {\n    // ...\n\n    dataTableOnBlur(event:any, col:any, rowData:any, dt:any) {\n      let evt:any = {\n         keyCode: 13, target: event.target\n      }\n      dt.onCellEditorKeydown(evt, col, rowData, rowIndex);\n    }\n}. The blur event is on the input element. It should fire.

Check the casing, it should be switchCellToViewMode\n. @jefftham It works fine for me in Chrome but it might not on other browsers. Thanks for the tip!. @a-kolybelnikov  If I'm not mistaken you're saying that when one cell has focus (is active) and you want another cell to have focus, it requires two clicks into the other cell? I don't see this behavior in the plnkr. In the plnkr, you only need to click the other cell once. Put your code in a plnkr so we can see it.. @sviswanathjcet  You probably found your answer by now but the change is event should not be prefixed with \"on\". It should be (change)=\"dataTableOnBlur($event, col, rowData, rowIndex, dt)\". ",

So far I can only change the link itself with routerLinkActive and not the layers of the p-tree component primeNG itself generates above it. .

Here is the same style but with shadow piercing:\n:host ::ng-deep .ui-menu {margin:0;}\ni currently use the shadow piercing method in my project because i feel that turning off encapsulation is disabling one of the greatest features of the Angular framework - the ability to keep everything contained and modular.\nHopefully in the near future the browsers (looking at you, IE and Firefox) will finally finish their implementation of the Web Components standard, including the Shadow DOM. Learn more about the Shadow DOM and Angular's ViewEncapsulation here.. but as far as i understand it from my experience, using styleClass only applies it to the parent component (in your case the p-tree element.) It doesn't work however if you're trying to target the elements inside the component because the markup is rendered in the DOM. So you have to use the other methods (view encapsulation, shadow piercing) to access and override those internal styles. correct me if I'm wrong?. FYI, /deep/ has now been replaced by ::ng-deep.\nI use :host ::ng-deep all over the place to override prime styles . This sounds like the same problem im facing, which is trying to use the .toggle function to open/close an OverlayPanel when clicking on a menu item.. Just switched over to p-dialog after using ng-bootstraps modal and I'm regretting it - experiencing a whole host of issues, many of which i had to solve after much trial and error with extremely shoddy CSS hacks.  this component needs desperate and immediate attention. +1 on this. ng-bootstraps popover is really nice this way. it has an arrow by default. being able to add an arrow would be great!. Awesome! I've been working around it with an ::after pseudo element that forms a triangle using borders, then positioning it, but a built in solution would be ideal!. Did this get added in 4.1.0? I still get the page scrolling in the background when scrolling the dialog with modal set to true.. Using [blockScroll]=\"true\" is anyone else having an issue where it still scrolls the body on touch devices? testing on my iphone, scrolling the dialog content scrolls the body content behind the dialog. on desktop it works fine and blocks scrolling. . There is another closed issue #2795 that talks about this as well, in regards to positioning the dialog when loading dynamic content. This has been a point of constant friction for me with PrimeNG dialog.. percentage support would be nice since the responsive property added at https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2795 doesnt work properly with dynamic content.\n@ericsvendsen, your solution works great in the mean time. I added a max-width: 1000px to your rule to prevent it from getting absurdly wide on wider desktop screens.. Any updates on this feature? Ideally you could do something like this with it (add a little arrow pseudo element and position it to an element instead of the default left/top corner):\n\n. I found this example of a popover (built on Angular CDK) that provides a horizontalAlign and verticalAlign option set that is exactly what I'm looking for. I just tried using it in my app and I like it a lot.\nCheck it out @cagataycivici ! There are some additional neat options provided. I think PrimeNG should glean some of the functionality ideas theyve employed here. Adding an arrow on top of that would make OverlayPanel a killer component :). @kenisteward can we see it?. I'm having this same problem as well.. id like to see a more ideal, built-in solution to this from the PrimeNG team. Loading dynamic content in a dialog seems like a pretty common use case.. @saximoer3 , i like your 3rd solution but couldnt get it to work. my dialog is still cutting off at the bottom of the window. could you provide a plunker example?. @cagataycivici thank you so much! i know many people will be happy about this new feature!. Awesome! Do we need to update the PrimeNG version or set an attribute or does it just work by default now?. @jacqueslareau agreed. my dialogs all have dynamic content. this new \"responsive\" and \"alwaysCenter\" setting just simply doesnt work. confirmed not working on 4.2.2. @rich4756 9 months since this issue was opened, i think its safe to say @cagataycivici and the PrimeNG team are ignoring this. This has been my experience on a number of significant bugs with the product.. I was working on a new dialog today where it loads with a table hidden (via *ngIf) and once it inserts the table into the dom, it pushes the dialog down and right, and when I move the dialog around the right edge stays glued to the ridge edge of the viewport. \ncant believe i've run into this issue again. It's truly shocking this is still an issue 9 months later and that this was even closed in the first place. PrimeNG 5.2.0. Just installed 5.2.1 and from a quick test it appears to be working! hooray!. @negberts mine is doing this as well in one place when i open a dropdown. it starts twitching up and down like that.\nhere is @negberts video but in gif format for convenience of viewing it directly on here:\n\n. Heres another example: (dont know if it matters but the dropdown uses append to body)\nthe whole dialog moves around and makes me miss clicks, or have to click twice to open it.\nto be clear - i want the centering feature with dynamic content, but maybe theres a way we can fix it from jumping pixels on stuff like this...\n\n. @cagataycivici yes, 5.2.2. @cagataycivici  I dont mind the idea of fixing the height of the content section, however it doesnt seem to work with vh or percent units. i use a max-height currently in vh in all our modals to allow overflow but allowing it to grow responsively with the screen size.\nare there any downsides to the first solution that you can see in your testing? it appears that the dialog currently recenters when i click. im wondering why the dropdown is causing this however, if it is appended to the body? shouldnt the dialog only consider the content inside of .ui-dialog-content? heres another screen capture  better illustrating this (click in, click out - reposition. click out again - reposition.):\n\ni wonder if adding a property is necessary with dynamic content. would you ever want the dialog to have the ability to grow beyond the viewport and NOT center? that seems odd to desire that behavior. seems to me that it should be the default behavior, not attached to a property.... @cagataycivici Good idea. i think that will work. Ill make sure to test once 5.2.3 is released. youre the man @cagataycivici ! i think that worked. I will test, specifically test vh units - a case where if the top value is being calculated on subpixels, ex. between 38.5px and 39px. Im worried it might cause that issue where it \"twitches\" back and forth between the whole and half pixel. im wondering if thats whats causing @negberts issue....\nhopefully the angular team will fix the issues with ngAfterViewChecked that require you to use the set timeout. then a proper solution can be implemented :)\nin either case, this is the best dialog i've seen yet. i think youve finally resolved some longstanding issues with a solution that (hopefully) remains bug free! Congrats!. one thing i would add to this feature request - it would be nice to have the search box at the top (when you set filter to true) be fixed position so that it doesnt disappear when scrolling through a set height list box. does that make sense? should i create a separate issue/feature request?. I'm having a lot of bugginess around dialogs when loading dynamic content. We've had to used fixed widths but it doesnt allow dialogs to work properly on mobile.. this would be nice as the new responsive=\"true\" is very buggy. Was this added to 4.1.1? or has it been pushed off to another milestone?. For whatever reason, if the dropdown is set to editable=true, it has a grey placeholder. But none of the dropdowns in my app are or should be editable. \nSo I tried to set the color grey using the angular styles for .ng-pristine and .ng-untouched, it still doesnt work because they apply the grey color to ALL dropdowns even the dropdown has pre-filled or pre-selected an option.\nI really dont see a way around this. The autocomplete and other input components all have grey placeholders, but Dropdown doesnt. hopefully this inconsistency is resolved soon as it causes some confusion in our app with all our input/date/autocomplete/etc placeholders being grey and the prime dropdown placeholders being black.. Status on this?. @cinnest I'm using this rule in my global stylesheet. It works ok, but relies on angulars ng-pristine validation class.\np-dropdown.ng-pristine.null .ui-dropdown-label,\np-dropdown.ng-pristine.null .ui-dropdown-trigger {color: $color-grey-medium;}. @cagataycivici can you add this to the 5.2.5 milestone? for some reason its been assigned to 4.1.1. We created our own component for something like this. basically just a menu that can slide in from the top/bottom/left/right of a container. Material has something similar called a bottom sheet. \nI would consider this an essential component for PrimeNG. Will we be able to attach this to a certain element? it would be cool to use these as a sort of slide over menu inside of a dialog for example.. Well, in my particular circumstance I chose ListBox because I wanted the panel only, I didn't want to attach it to the input field like multi select. I see that they are almost identical. However the listbox header isn't fixed like the multi select is.. So glad for this fix, thanks a ton!\nI wonder if this property should also be added to dropdown, autocomplete etc? Or perhaps a default behavior?\nThe reason I bring this up here is I'm experiencing this issue in several places where the same thing is happening, both on the body and the dialog content. \nI have a dropdown inside a dialog, for example, and when i scroll the dropdown panel, it also scrolls the dialog content (assuming its overflowing)\nI also have a dropdown on a table, so when i scroll the dropdown panel it scrolls the page with it as well (also assuming the page body is overflowing)\n. Is there any workaround way to do this until the feature is added? Its very important in our application as we have several autocompletes that need a required attribute.. @cagataycivici im thinking it would just stay open all the time - so it wont close. its just acting as a permanently open list, similar to listbox. the onClose or whatever behavior would be disabled, so its always open. does that make sense?. this could apply to both autocomplete and dropdown.. @cagataycivici  Thanks for the clarification. I would definitely toss in my hat for an openOnFocus feature. Thanks!. @mronus I'm having the exact same behavior as yours. Applying appendTo body fixes it, as does your fix. Definitely a bug introduced in 4.3.0 somewhere.. Still have this bug in PrimeNG 5. updated to 5.0.2 and the issue persists. I tried recreating the bug in plunker but have been unsuccessful. There is certainly something going on in my app, if Prime is willing to reach out to me and address this issue, I'd be happy to screenshare.. @cagataycivici please re-open this issue. \ni was finally able to create a working example of the bug. See the Plunker.\nIt appears that if the overlaypanel has position:fixed it breaks the toggle between display: none and display: block, or at least, I think this is the culprit, because if I change it to position: absolute, it then works correctly. Please investigate.. no response in a over a month on this issue. sometimes i wonder if the primeNG team just cherrypicks issues and closes ones they dont want to deal with because there is broken functionality all over the place that is completely unaddressed. When I create issues they are immediately closed and never looked at again 50% of the time. Im beginning to regret my choice using PrimeNG in my application. if this is the way they run their product I certainly will be staying away from the Pro upgrade, which I had strongly considered until recently. I don't mean to sound ungrateful as they are doing a valuable service, I am just incredibly disappointed what feels like complete disinterest in handling bugs for their users.. I'm still having this issue in PrimeNG 5.2.4... 6 months later.... For what its worth I tested with both Chrome and Firefox, and I could only replicate it in Chrome. Same applies for the plunker i created above.. i could use dir=\"rtl\" which works, but its not ideal. id like to keep the trigger on the right side instead of the left side.. the top value generated for the inline css on the first click resets to 0 on subsequent clicks. not sure why. \nif it matters for context, we have a table and each row's last cell contains p-splitbutton. we are loading the list items in dynamically based on some conditions we set, the list items that appear may be different for each table row.. I havent been able to create a plunker replicating this, but the issue persists in 5.0.2. After the first click on a fresh page load, any splitbutton panel (using appendTo=\"body\") resets the top css property to 0.  \nRefresh the page and it assigns it top: 482pxand positions it properly, but then close and open another splitbutton panel and it resets to top: 0 . the left value works correctly however.... I'm unable to provide a plunker at the moment because anytime i try to use any primeNG component it gives me some weird angular router error. i think it is either a bug with Plunker or primeNG's issue template. \nAnyway, I am still having this issue. It happens wherever I have a splitbutton inside a table cell and these conditions are present:\n\nBoth regular and when using appendTo=\"body\"\nEverytime after the first click on a fresh page load\nwhen the panel is near the bottom so it tries to position it above instead of below\n\nWhen those 3 criteria are met this bug presents itself. I took a GIF screen capture so you can see:\n\n. Is PrimeIcons a thing already or are you creating it from scratch? . @BootsThunderclap @cagataycivici They are working on an angular component currently, if it helps. I'm using it successfully, though its still in beta. Instead of assigning an icon like <i class=\"fa fa-times\"></i> and having it replaced with an svg element in the DOM, you instead use it like <fa-icon [icon]=\"faTimes\"></fa-icon>\nThis works well and is compatible with angulars controls/directives like two way binding, ngIf, [class], etc. @cagataycivici in the meantime, is there anyway to use the far prefix for fontawesome icons? \nfor example, I have a prime menu item, {label: 'On Hold', icon: 'fa-hand-paper-o'} that no longer works with FA5.\nbefore, with FA4, if I wanted the outlined icon i would use fa-hand-paper-o but now in FA5 its been changed to use the prefix instead, so the same icon would now be far fa-hand-paper. @Qocotzxin its available at FortAwesome's GitHub\nhttps://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome\nIt doesnt work with primeNG but it does allow you to use FA5 and SVG icons in angular in a way that preserves angular's front-end functionalities like *ngIf and [class], etc. im having this bug as well. assigning a height of 85 to a p-chart, the height generated in the dom on the canvas is 150.\nthank you @sagar-shirsath for the PR, hopefully PrimeNG team accepts it and pushes out a fix ASAP.\nupdate: i tested adding a width rule to p-chart and it doesnt work either.. @cagataycivici what about if you wanted to do what i was doing in a couple instances, where it was responsive but had a set height. for example, i have a chart inside of a box on the page that i need to stay a fixed height but is allowed to grow horizontally with the viewport.\nim on 5.2.1 and im still having this issue. I have a height of 90px on a chart and it wont respect that unless i make the chart non-responsive. before it be responsive in terms of width but the height would be fixed at 90px.\nim a little confused by the use of vw and vh units, it seems like in most cases you would want to size the chart to a container instead of the viewport. wouldnt percentage values relative to its container be better? . this issue appears to still be present on 5.2.1. ive tried setting width and height and it wont honor either value unless i set responsive to false. in the meantime ive removed the height, width, and responsive attributes and applied the following css: ::ng-deep .chart-container canvas {height: 90px !important;}\nalso, on your first example, you're saying to use vw and vh units but on the actual attribute you're setting them to 40w and 80w, is that a typo? Did you mean to type 40vw and 80vh?\nalso you say \"Charts are responsive by default\" but on the p-chart documentation page, it says the default value is false.\n\n. im having this problem with as well. this is a MAJOR bug. Hopefully primeNG team can resolve this with a hotfix release.\n@cagataycivici this breaks everything inside dialogs - growl messages, dropdowns, overlaypanels, everything. im shocked this made it through to a release!. @brian428 that solution only works if you're not using modal=\"true\" otherwise the ui-dialog-mask covers up the dialog. \ni tried overriding that ones z-index to 999 but it has to be done from the global stylesheet.\n.ui-dialog {z-index: 1000 !important;}\n.ui-dialog-mask {z-index: 999 !important;}\nhopefully this works. i need to test more..

Huuum, i need time to think how we can solve it.\nIn dataList component the template is created by pTemplateWrapper inside a ngFor (where we have index). I don't know how we can inject this value inside pTemplateWrapper.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/datalist/datalist.ts#L20-L22\n@cagataycivici you have ideia how to solve it?\n(sorry mention, but i'm very curious how solve it) . #1107. You can override ui-treenode-icon fa fa-fw for your tree view.. I tried simulate but here worked. Can you make a plunkr?\nJust to know:\n\nThe error look about our NgIf expression - the first time it runs, [style.display] is 'none', then ngAfterContentInit() runs and changes the value to something other than 'block'.\n\nBut I can not simulate the problem.. Now the calendar close after the date is selected. I tried and worked here.\nLook https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L463\nand https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L816 and https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L1163. PrimeNG uses QuillJS and the library does not support resize yet.\nhttps://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/905. This is not a bug.\nLook, https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L206\nThe stepMinute is a number, but for angular respect the type you need use brackets []\nUse [stepMinute]=\"15\" instead of stepMinute=\"15\"\n. It's not a bug. The example show a virtual scroll with \"lazy\" option enabled. To show values when lazy is enabled it's necessary user finish scroll.. @cagataycivici sorry, but maybe we can try use if moment is defined, i don't know if this is a good pratice, but this method will not create a \"direct\" dependency.. Have an error in your code. You are using CSS from version 2.0.0, but using npm package 2.0.1, please change your CSS imports to 2.0.1 to see the problem solved.. Wooow, nice! I burning my mind to think how solve it.\nLet's me try explain whats happening.\nInside doCheck() of AutoComplete component PrimeNG using IterableDiffers to check if have changes in array of sugestions, by the way, when you erase one character of filter for example, in many times the results is the same then  IterableDiffers.diff return false and we not call this.show()\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/autocomplete/autocomplete.ts#L146 . I wont create PR because, I don't know about @cagataycivici plans for Angular 4 (new branch or migrate). In my opnion we can migrate to 4, because not have many break changes.\nBy the way reading the doc https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#features we can se compilation flag now we have:\ncompiler: Add a enableLegacyTemplate option to support  (e99d721). #2141 . This is a wrong use to \"rel\" attribute I guess because this is used when you have a link to another linked page with your content.\nFor example, if you have A.html and B.html, in A you put <a rel=\"next\" href=\"B.html\">.\nI searched on internet about googlebots crawling and not found explanation about how the engine works with this property when is ajax pagination.\nPlease if you have ideias about how it's work, so we have a cool discussion :). @ova2 you should, why not? :). For solve this issue we need big changes https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20160317/examples/radio/radio.html\nI need learn more about ARIA to contribute with this issue.. I can't reproduce, can you create a plunkr to help us?. Oh, sorry PR already exists, :P. can you create plunkr to reproduce this error?. Brackets are missing for \"sticky\" input on doc's. This cause the problem on showcase.\nIn your issue you are not using sticky, so, i can't simulate the problem when sticky is not defined. If you are removed the property to open issue, please use [sticky] with brackets instead of sticky.. @sourdoth \nWhen strick if defined, growl messages are not removed automatically after a period defined by life option. Please change to false or remove the attr. @CatherineBorykina in actual release this works, but you need use brackets in [sticky] attribute with false value or remove this attribute.. changed onMouseclick to check if clear button is clicked using:\nthis.clearClick = (<Element>event.target).classList.contains('ui-dropdown-clear-icon');\nand removed all others checks and sets about  this.clearClick\n5300\n.

Column headers are too narrow when scrollable=true.\nI find that this issue only occurs when there are not enough rows to fill up the scrollHeight. Since there is no overflow, no scrollbar is shown.

Still an issue with the Omega theme as well (but not super noticeable) . And probably with all other themes, because I don't think it's just a styling issue. See my previous comment.. cc @cagataycivici\nOne reliable fix is to apply the following style:\ncss\ndiv.ui-datatable-scrollable-body {\n  overflow-y: scroll;\n}\nThis style causes the scrollbar of the scrollable part to always be visible. This prevents the table body from expanding and becoming misaligned with the table headers.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\n. I have the same problem. The example code from the documentation is buggy.\nhtml\n<p-dialog (visible)]=\"display\">\n  <p-footer>\n    <div class=\"ui-dialog-buttonpane ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix\">\n      <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-close\" (click)=\"display=false\" label=\"No\"></button>\n      <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-check\" (click)=\"display=false\" label=\"Yes\"></button>\n    </div>\n  </p-footer>\n</p-dialog>\nSetting display=false in the buttons' click handlers correctly hides the dialog, but it doesn't trigger the onBeforeHide or onAfterHide events.\nInstead I had to write custom code that calls the Dialog.hide(event) method.\nhtml\n<p-dialog #dialog (visible)]=\"display\">\n  <p-footer>\n    <div class=\"ui-dialog-buttonpane ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix\">\n      <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-close\" (click)=\"dialog.hide($event)\" label=\"No\"></button>\n      <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-check\" (click)=\"confirm();dialog.hide($event)\" label=\"Yes\"></button>\n    </div>\n  </p-footer>\n</p-dialog>. Bad copy-paste indeed. Example code is taken from here: http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/dialog\nI modified the example to make the important bits stand out. I didn't mean to delete the left bracket.. I'll try to make it absolutely clear for everyone.\nHere is the minimal repro for a dialog + event handler for onAfterHide. The dialog has a button to hide the dialog. Clicking this button correctly hides the dialog, but the onAfterHide event is not triggered and the alert is never shown.\nhtml\n<p-dialog [(visible)]=\"display\" (onAfterHide)=\"alert('Dialog hidden!')\" >\n  <button (click)=\"display=false\">Close</button>\n</p-dialog>\nThe workaround that I found is to forward the button's click event to the Dialog's hide method.\nhtml\n<p-dialog #dialog [(visible)]=\"display\" (onAfterHide)=\"alert('Dialog hidden!')\" >\n  <button (click)=\"dialog.hide($event)\">Close</button>\n</p-dialog>\nThis code is the only code that behaves as expected.. I don't think that passing the click event was necessary to make my example work. I don't remember why I added that.. Changing the variable does not trigger the event.. Some cleanup is in order to make this work. The logic for showing/hiding the dialog and triggering the events looks like a mess. No wonder it doesn't work.\nThese blocks of code look smelly to me:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/dialog/dialog.ts#L136-L147\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/dialog/dialog.ts#L149-L160\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/dialog/dialog.ts#L257-L263\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/dialog/dialog.ts#L208-L214\nMy first thought is that show() and hide() do way too much. They should do little more than toggle the visible status. In fact, just remove show and hide. Only allow changing the dialog's visibility by using the visible property getter and setter.\nThe visible setter should raise onBeforeShow or onBeforeHide before assigning the new value to _visible and that's it.\nThe onAfterShow and onAfterHide events can be raised in a round of ngOnChanges which I believe is the only correct place for that.\nI don't know what the shown property is for, but it looks like it was added to check if the dialog is in a valid state. That's amusing because a user can assign any value to it and mess up the dialog's internal state. I'm sure that this property is not really needed and can be removed after this code cleanup,\nI don't know what disableModality method is but remove it anyway. Modal dialogs in HTML are a complete lie. You can't prevent a user from focusing background elements, so don't even pretend that you can. Even clicking on the dialog's overlay itself will cause a click event to bubble up to the document root and then all bets are off.. I have the same problem. Getting this fixed is critical for me. I have 400,000+ records to display so I cannot use eager loading and searching those records is too difficult without being able to sort on more than 1 column.. @born2net that workaround does not solve the issue with ngrx.\nThe ngrx mentality is to treat all values as if they are immutable. Application state in an ngrx application is updated by replacing any existing values with new values instead of modifying existing values. The new values may be modified clones of the previous values, but after that they can never be modified. \nThis programming style can be enforced by using ngrx-store-freeze in your ngrx project. As mentioned, any attempt to modify the current state will result in an error being thrown by ngrx-store-freeze.\nAll this means that it is impossible to use values from the ngrx store in a DataTable that has selectionMode enabled because the DataTable treats your values as mutable. It mutates YOUR objects to track its OWN internal state. That is pretty disgusting in my opinion.\nI'm starting to think this problem has been fixed in a recent version because I can't reproduce this myself. To reproduce this problem, set the selection mode to 'single', run Object.freeze() on all rows and then try to select a row.. This issue is bigger than not being able to use immutable collections. With ngrx, every collection is immutable but every collection item is also immutable.\nI'd like to know if immutable data structures are now supported in the latest version. I used to have the same problem as @liubiggun but now I can't reproduce the error after updating.. @PierreRochard I only read the description but I'm guessing that is a completely different issue.\nWe're only talking about the feature that lets the user select rows by clicking them. This feature has a nasty side effect of attaching properties to objects that are selected. I assume it does this to keep track of which rows are selected. This breaks when the row objects are frozen objects.\nAt least that's how it used to be. Me and others are no longer observing this behavior in the latest version.. I just updated to PrimeNG 4.0.0 and can confirm that using the new dataKey option fixes the problem.. There is also an undocumented method: createLazyLoadMetadata that returns a new LazyLoadEvent.\nStill, I vote to reopen this issue. There should be an API just to reload the table without having to change the sorting, filtering or source data.. I suspect that this is by design to support opening multiple dialogs at once, so that dialogs are stacked in the order that they were opened (oldest on the background, newest on the foreground).. @cagataycivici and what about when editing is completed by any other means? Clicking outside the field also concludes editing but does not trigger onEditComplete. Think of the touchscreen users.. Bump. The fundamental problem here is that filtering is applied on keydown instead of on input or on change. Any way to change the filter without pressing a key breaks change detection.\ncc @cagataycivici @Mrtcndkn . @cagataycivici I just updated to 4.1.0 and the issue still exists when using [globalFilter]=\"inputRef\" . Same problem with p-calendar.. This can be easily fixed by setting overflow-y: scroll on the scrollable table. This ensures that the scrollbar area is always shown, even if there are not enough rows to cause overflow.. Another option that would work for me is if you implement templating for the display value. \nExample API:\nhtml\n<p-calendar [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n  <ng-template pTemplate=\"displayValue\">\n      <span>{{value | date:'shortDate'}}<span>\n  <ng-template>\n</p-calendar>. Ehh it depends. How would the timeFormatter be configured?\nAs an input binding:\n<p-calendar [(ngModel)]=\"value\" [timeFormatter]=\"localize\">\nAs an event binding:\n<p-calendar [(ngModel)]=\"value\" (timeFormatter)=\"localize($event)\">\nMaybe something else?. Not directly possible, but if you emit an object then an event handler can mutate its properties. \nAnyway why can't the formatted date be a string binding?. Okay forget about using binding syntax (or any template syntax) for this.\nHow about you create a TimeFormatter service that is injected into CalendarComponent? Then I can create my own MyTimeFormatter service that implements TimeFormatter and add it to the providers array of my app module.\n```ts\n// included in primeng\nexport class TimeFormatter {\n  parseDate(value: string): Date {\n    // default implementation\n  }\nformatDate(value: Date): string {\n    // default implementation\n  }\n}\n// custom code\nexport class MyTimeFormatter implements TimeFormatter {\n  parseDate(value: string): Date {\n    // Moment.js implementation\n    return moment(value).toDate();\n  }\nformatDate(value: Date): string {\n    // Moment.js implementation\n    return moment(value).format('YYYY MM DD');\n  }\n}\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [CalendarModule],\n  providers: [{ provide: TimeFormatter, useClass: MyTimeFormatter }],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n``. I would like to know what problem is solved by hiding overflow. I just don't see it.. So the question remains: why is \"overflow:hidden\" the default style? It causes many problems and appears to solve none.. Pulling components out of their parent node and appending them to the document root is a lazy workaround for something that can be solved with CSS only. I'm not very knowledgeable about accessibility but I can imagine that moving elements around the DOM like that makes web apps unusable to people who rely on screen readers and such.. I updated my original post under _Expected behavior_ because the wording wasn't very clear.. DataTable methods for input/change events is perfect. Just please make sure that the methods can do everything that the built-in editor inputs does.. Long story short:onLazyLoadshould be triggered afterAfterViewInitor else you likely end up seeingExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` in development.\n@RebelSyntax You should see this error in development builds but never in production builds. Another possible cause is that your unit tests run synchronously while your real code runs asynchronously. Only synchronous code can result in this error.. @RebelSyntax did you read my edit?\nI have a good guess of why you had that problem: your unit tests probably use in-memory test data while your real code goes out to a web service to fetch data. One runs synchronously and the other is asynchronous.\nLet me know if my assumptions are wrong.. Okay so can I use onHeaderCheckboxToggle to know which rows were affected? Where is the documentation?. That gives me all the selected rows without telling me which ones were added or removed.. I honestly don't know if this is a bug or a feature request. I marked this as a bug because the name onRowSelect says nothing about how the row was selected.. Okay then I propose that onRowSelect and onRowDeselect should be triggered once per click of the header checkbox. The data property of the event object should be an array of dataKey of the affected rows.\nIf no dataKey is specified then use the entire row object instead, or just don't raise the event at all.\nSince this change is breaking, perhaps do not re-use onRowSelect but instead add a pluralized version onRowsSelect.. @cagataycivici how can we use that to create a transaction log of which rows were affected by clicking the header checkbox?.

Same issue with the [scrollHeight] and [scrollWidth] properties on p-dataTable component:\nTypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'scrollHeight' of object '[object HTMLElement]'. @wujitouch your suggestion to add a blur event on a cell is neither working with pColumn, nor with ng-template (pTemplate=\"body\"), nor if I add it to the datatable properties. Moreover, I have written a directive to add an event listener for blur event, but it also won't work on the datatable cells. . @wujitouch thanks for the explanation, however, I am still having difficulty to understand your implementation. If I get you right, this has nothing to do with the blur event itself. You're working around it with keydown events ... ?. I did test the 'blur' event on the datatable to no success. There is no event emitted at all on blur. It might have something to do with the fact that the \"useCapture\" parameter of the addEventListener must be set to true (?): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/blur. @victor-ponce \nthanks for the plunkr link. I've been testing it, and while a blur event is being emitted, the last two arguments (rowIndex and dt) are throwing 'undefined' in the console. I can grab the event, the column data, the rowData, but I can neither emit the onEditComplete event, nor save the changed model data, because the dt is undefined.\nI have tried to just update my model onBlur, without emitting an onEditComplete, but that won't work.. @victor-ponce 1. I had to add a row-index variable. 2. I had a typo in my datatable reference (!). It works now, and the data is being passed and stored. Thank you so much.. @victor-ponce \nhi, I have another question to the example code in plunkr. My dt object does not have a switchCellToViewMode() function and an error is being thrown on each edit: \nERROR TypeError: this.dataTable.switchCellToviewMode is not a function.\nFor the time being I have commented it out, but I'm just curious, where does it come from in your code. Thank you for helping with this!. all, I have another glitch with this implementation. Now that the data is being save on blur/ key-up, it's not possible to immediately activate input fields in other cells: they get active / inactive on first click, and only on the second click they can be activated, which creates a super weird effect, and breaks the flow. Has anyone else experienced this? Wondering, if it is due to some other settings of the datatable.. @victor-ponce I have found the \"bug\" to be on my side. I had a line in my code with made the datatable re-render on edit save. It all works perfectly now hat I have gotten rid of that. The only thing which does not work, is Enter key event. The binding is gone, although it is there in the built-in editor. I'm looking into this.. same issue. saying good-bye to primeng's file-upload: cannot find a quick solution and cannot wait for one either because of the project deadline.. @ikuriel thanks a lot, brilliant.

Found the same issue here. I might be mistaken, but I think the selection in datatable is based in row data, not in row index. So, if you have two rows with equal data, both will be highlighted, even though only one was actually selected.\nHowever, it doesn't explain why tables with similar rows, where the only difference is the date in one or more columns, show the same behaviour.\nIs there any workaround for this?.

So how do we convert it or store it in a way the calendar can understand and populate the default value. I need to set it via JSON or session storage.\n. To add more feedback. We hit this problem also as soon as we started implementing p-dropdown with our rest api. None of the data models contained \"label\" or \"value\". Changing or adding columns in DB was going to be a huge pain. Mapping results client side is not optimal either.\nWe ended up extending SelectItem in our model and then deserialize the data. Which is nice because sometimes you'll want to manipulate data like below example for label. So it can be nice to have the SelectItem API stay consistent for elements requiring option tags.\nNot sure this optimal either but works for our situation.\n```\nexport class VehicleGroup extends SelectItem implements SerializableDataModel {\n    public id: number;\n    public value: number;\n    public isDepositRequired: boolean;\n    public description: string;\n    public label: string;\npublic methodName() {\n    return 'vehiclegroup';\n}\n\npublic deserialize(input) {\n    if (input) {\n        this.id = input['id'];\n        this.isDepositRequired = input['isDepositRequired'];\n        this.description = input['description'];\n        this.label = this.id + ' - ' + this.description;\n        this.value = this.id;\n\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\n.

I don't want to waste my time going through 85 issues. And I don't want to waste my time going to github -> web site -> forum -> topic -> blog. You need to assign unique values to the name attributes of the p-radiobutton tags:\nname=\"color1\" (...) name=\"color2\" etc.\n. Can't confirm that, seems to work fine to me.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/fRx4VjWzNFlqyGBBOMzZ?p=preview. I guess you were right, and this is a bug in the component. The examples clearly state to assign the same name to all the radios in a group.. I agree with your 2.\nI need this to easily create modal with dynamic content.\nBy default (with directive), if I open, close, then reopen the modal, the content will be the same. If I have a form, i need to manually reset the form in the modal when reopen.. In the source code of multiselect component, there is the method:\nfindLabelByValue(val: any): string {\nlet label = null;\n        for(let i = 0; i < this.options.length; i++) {\n            let option = this.options[i];\n            if(option.value == val) {\n                label = option.label;\n                break; \n            }\n        }\n        return label;\n    }\nI think there is a problem with the line option.value == val\nHow can it work with object?

My solution only works for one row expanded at a time, which is a bit annoying, but that was all I needed. You could theoretically make it work for multiple rows, but I would imagine that would get quite messy.\n. Would be nice to see that fix pulled in sometime soon. I'm having the same issue with the initial custom sort not working. Worked around it for now by calling my custom sort function manually once the datatable is populated, but would prefer not to have to resort to such a messy solution.\n.

I was having similar problems, stemming from changing the options in the dropdown dynamically. Initially, there were no options until I made an asynchronous call to a REST service to get the values, so the dropdown autosized to around 50px, since there was no content. Calling updateDimensions in AfterContentChecked() resized it appropriately after the options had been loaded. Not sure if there's a better way to handle it in dropdown.ts so that I don't need to make an explicit call to updateDimensions, but it seems to be a viable workaround for the moment.\n. Pretty much just called the updateDimensions function on the p-dropdown element from the ngAfterContentChecked life cycle hook in the component containing the dropdown. This was with primeng 1.0.0 and Angular 2.0.0 though, so no guarantees that nothing has changed.\n\n``` \n...\n@ViewChild(Dropdown) dropdown: Dropdown;\n...\nngAfterContentChecked() {\n    if (someConditionIndicatingThatDropdownOptionsHaveChanged) {\n        this.dropdown.updateDimensions();\n    }\n}\n```. Looks like this was fixed in the beta12 release\n. Looks like this isn't an issue anymore since these fields were recently made public.\n. Looks like this isn't necessary anymore, since the fields I exposed were recently switched from protected/private to public.\n. Ah, you're right. I missed setting sortColumn, but it looks like your commit should resolve the issue.  Thanks!. Just realized that this is entirely unnecessary, since inputTextarea is a directive. Whoops.\n. I think this is a valid issue. If you change the version of primeng in the plunk to 4.1.0-rc.2 (link below), everything works correctly.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/qKr1apIOG2NKqHJqFnTp?p=preview\nThat seems to indicate that the problem is not having an ng-content element inside an ng-template, but rather, something that changed between primeng 4.1.0 RC2 and RC3. The error I'm seeing in my project occurs when this.view.destroy() is called inside ngOnDestroy in datatable.ts. This line was added between the two aforementioned releases, so I'm guessing it may be the source of the problem.\nThe specific error message I get is:\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.\nWould appreciate if this issue could be reopened and addressed..

This obligation to implement some interface is indeed a pain, since the incoming data has to be converted to SelectedItem just to be shown or has to implement it (which is also not very good, if some dto object has to know about SelectedItem)\n. can't you convert any items to any interface internally? for instance we tell the dropdown that the label field name is \"name\", \"enabled\" = \"active\" and so on. In the options setter you create wrapper for every incoming element converting it to SelectItem-Implementation which has for instance\nget label(): string {\n  //I skip checking if prop exists \n  return element[labelField];\n}\nthis is actually what we have to do in the client code - convert incoming options to array of SelectItem-Wrappers\n. I'm sorry, I must be missing something. The chart where working just fine, at least I could change the data reference and the chart was updating. It didn't work for multiple datasets? Ok, maybe, but it did for more common scenarios and with complex ones we could still call some update/refresh whatever. Now if you update the data in runtime (and it must be 99% of all cases, who shows static data anyway?) the charts show literally nothing so I have to inject chart component in every page and call this refresh stuff every time the data changes. I think it is a huge step backward in usability. I also experience strange behaviour with DataTable, I have a master-detail and the detail shows wrong content after second change in master, with wrong I mean it shows column values from wrong rows, like if I have an array of key-values, the key1 becomes valueX instead of value1. I have reverted to 1.1.1 and the problem is gone, so it must be some bug in the latest changes to DataTable. ",

I have found a way to change background the color of the column.\nPlease let me know if I have done it the correct way or need some improvement.\nBelow is my code :\nHTML Code:\n<p-column  header=\"ID\" >\n    <template let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n            <span #x> {{ getColor(x,data) }} {{ data.id }}</span>\n    </template>\n</p-column>\nTS Code:\n// just a sample code, to assign background color depending on our required criteria\ngetColor(x, data) {\n    var color: string;\n    if (data.status === 1) {\n      color = 'lightgreen';\n    } else if (data.status === 2) {\n      color = 'lightblue';\n    } \n    x.parentNode.parentNode.style.background = color; // x.parentNode.parentNode accesses the <td> element of table :)\n  }\nHere is the output:\n\nHope this helps!!\nThanks.

As such we plan to drop support in Angular (for all 3 of /deep/, >>> and ::ng-deep).

How are you changing the datasets?. @MStoehr Thanks for the update, but I don't think it'll be necessary after all.

Declare a ref in your chart component <p-chart #chart type=\"bar\" [data]=\"chartData\" [options]=\"chartOptions\"></p-chart>,  then in your component import UIChart import { UIChart } from \"primeng/components/chart/chart\";, get the view ref (change \"chart\" to the name of your reference) @ViewChild(\"chart\") chart: UIChart; and call chart.refresh() after changing your datasets.. @MStoehr Have you tried something like this?. @seanareed Calling getRemote works every second click (fourth, sixth et cetera) or it only works after the second click (third, fourth and so forth)?. @seanareed Just for testing purposes, try setting a timeout on chart.refresh() with a delay of a second or two.. @Mrtcndkn Any updates on this?. @cagataycivici I'm on a similar boat as @Danieleeee, I want to load data dynamically from an API and I can't make the user update the data manually.

I have created a custom component with the help of chips and autocomplete components and its working fine for me. So you can also try to merge these two features in a single component or if you still need that feature then i can share my components with you guys. Just let me know in such case.. @elega9t \nSure. Hi guys,\n@elega9t  @ducduongtmb  @ducduongtmb \nCurrently i am working on a downstream repository of prineNg. It will take some time so for now you can use below code to add new values in autocomplete with chips, tab click also adds chips. Follow the steps below and in case of any issue reply me: \ns-autocomplete.components.txt\nStep 1> update the paths with your node_module folder path with primeNg in the include file\nimport {InputTextModule} from '../../../../node_modules/primeng/components/inputtext/inputtext';\nimport {ButtonModule} from '../../../../node_modules/primeng/components/button/button';\nimport { ttTooltipModule } from './tt-tooltip.directive';\nimport {SharedModule, PrimeTemplate} from '../../../../node_modules/primeng/components/common/shared';\nimport {DomHandler} from '../../../../node_modules/primeng/components/dom/domhandler';\nStep 2> Import the custom autocomplete module \"SAutocompleteWithChipsModule\" in your module.\nStep 3> use the compnent with the primeNg's original attributes but with new selector \"s-autoComplete\"\n\nThen Enjoy!. @ARandomDude: It'll work just keep that piece of css code at you top level component's scss/css file.. @lebnic \n@akbarzg \nHey Guys, I can able to fix this with a super simple steps. Place holder truncated due to some of the css properties there is no other issues in their components and libraries. See the css properties and selector below what primeNg currently have:\n1).\n.ui-autocomplete-input-token {\n    display: inline-block;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    list-style-type: none;\n    margin: 0 0 0 .125em;\n    padding: .25em .25em .25em 0;\n}\n2.)\n.ui-autocomplete-input-token .ui-inputtext {\n    border: 0 none;\n    width: 10em;\n    outline: medium none;\n    background-color: transparent;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    box-shadow: none;\n    -moz-border-radius: 0;\n    -webkit-border-radius: 0;\n    border-radius: 0;\n}\nAt first class add one new attribute ( width: 100%; ) you can also add this attribute in the relevant chips class if this is happening with chips components. And you can also see they are using the fixed width in the second class at point (2) make it ( width: 100%; ) also. Then the issue will solve for you if another css properties not overrides your new properties. If this happens then use !important followed by you property. \n. @ahmni01 \nTry to import this in you app.module.ts  \"import {TreeModule,TreeNode} from 'primeng/primeng';\". @ahmni01  can you share code of app.module.ts or wherever you imported the required module for tree component. . @ahmni01\nStep 1> import the TreeModule in your app module : import {TreeModule} from 'primeng/primeng';\nStep 2> remove TreeNode import statement from { import { TreeNode } from 'primeng/primeng'; } app.module.ts and import it at your component file where you want to use the 'p-tree' component. it should work.\nIssue: you are using an p-tree selector but you haven't import the module for p-tree and the second issue is TreeNode is a type not a module so remove all appearance of TreeNode from app.module.ts and add it in your component where you are using tree feature. it should work.. Implemented a fix in PR #5422 . @opetriienko: It's not a bug in p-dialog, ngOnInit is a life cycle hook called by Angular2 to indicate that Angular is done creating the component that's why you are getting the messages printed on browser's console.. @opetriienko : You can initialize the form on OnInit if you are using angular's reactive form & initialization should happen inside of a OnChanges method if data comes from any parent component..

Also when  *ngIf is used in a <template> inside <p-autocomplete>. When we reviewed the NgFor, NgIf, and NgSwitchbuilt-in directives, we called out an oddity of the syntax: the asterisk (*) that appears before the directive names.\nThe * is a bit of syntactic sugar that makes it easier to read and write directives that modify HTML layout with the help of templates. NgFor, NgIf, and NgSwitchall add and remove element subtrees that are wrapped in <template> tags.\nWe didn't see the <template> tags because the * prefix syntax allowed us to skip those tags and focus directly on the HTML element that we are including, excluding, or repeating.\nReed more on Angular.io\nThe problem was in declaration of template variable in controls:\n@ContentChild(TemplateRef) itemTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;\nFor the first run everything works good, but when we try to change items collection the itemTemplate take  template of NgFor, NgIf, or NgSwitch. And that's why we have broken view.\nIn my fix I replaced variable declaration to: \n@ContentChild('itemTemplate') itemTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;\nAutocomplete, Carousel, Chips, Datagrid, Datalist, Datascroller, Dropdown, Listbox, Orderlist and Picklist require a <template #itemTemplate> element and we'll get the correct templateRef in all these controls.\nFor example:\n<p-dataList [value]=\"cars\">\n        <p-header>\n            List of Cars\n        </p-header>\n        <template let-car #itemTemplate>\n            {{car.brand}}\n        </template>\n</p-dataList>.

You could make a change to primeng in node_modules. What happens on exportCSV function is that its using values instead of dataToRender. Technically all the fields of each object are identical at least from what I've seen. Not sure if there is any other diffs between them. Its just that DataToRender will accurately show the filtered items. \nSo in datatable.js under export CSV change this.values to: \nthis.dataToRender.forEach(function (record, i) {\n            csv += '\\n';\n            for (var i_1 = 0; i_1 < _this.columns.length; i_1++) {\n                if (_this.columns[i_1].field) {\n                    csv += _this.resolveFieldData(record, _this.columns[i_1].field);\n                    if (i_1 < (_this.columns.length - 1)) {\n                        csv += _this.csvSeparator;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        });.

The current time picker works - but if you need to enter specific minutes, you have to click  the arrows a lot until you hit the right one eventually.. Noticed performance issues as well - some of our tables can be 22k row (with pagination).\nBut even smaller 1-2k rows are slow. Selecting a row has noticeable delay (if checkcolumn is enabled i can see up to 1s delay before it is checked).\nRapidly selecting rows can end up freezing the browser as memory usage also skyrockets.. Iv noticed in the code that there are places where property is bound to methods - like isSelected().\nThis is bad because it causes angular to trigger and run over those methods insane number of times every second. Change detection triggers on any click - even mouse hover etc.\nA thousand row table could easily trigger it tens of thousands of times every second.\nSo it does all the comparing/method calls/logic every single time.  And currently it does not check properly for empty selection.\nif (this._selected) is true if it is a empty array. This needs length check, value assigned to a property that is updated when selection changes.\nThere may be more places like this. . Can confirm - bootstrap theme (perhaps others too).\nI have 100% width set and the header leaves 17px margin when there is not enough data in the table below to show the scrollbar. This causes header to get misaligned.\nI do not have resizeable columns enabled (but for some reason they still ignore  given widths and resize themselves regardless).. The 4.0.1 updated the code for scrollbar detection it seems. i do not get that issue anymore.. i happened to look at it (going to need it soon), did a search and end up here. It is rather simple tho with a simple override:\nEther globally:\n.ui-steps-item {\n  float:none !important;\n}\nor in component:\n:host /deep/ .ui-steps-item {\n  float:none !important;\n}. @khichar-anil but it is, i'm using it. It was added in 4.2.0 RC1.:\nui-autocomplete-loader | Loader icon.\n. Why not override the icon in css? The class is provided (my previous comment).\nlike/deep/ .ui-autocomplete-loader::before {content: \"\\\\f110\" !important;}'\n. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/4.3.0/src/app/components/autocomplete/autocomplete.css. I have 4.3.0 installed from npm and i can see it in primeng.css and autocomplete.js. @Darnoj  Theme should not affect the npm core. Isn't the ultima theme as a separate resource?. You likely don't have font awesome included in the project.. Don't have ultima so cant  say much about it - but if it's overriden, are all the specific classes for each element there too?\nPerhaps it doesn't have fa-circle-o-notch in material and no custom class added for material override.. This would be extra useful now. Especially since you implemented date range picker.. Same problem. It seems t be filling the filter field from a variable used to filter after it returns the filtered results, especially noticeable on tables with large number of rows.. Would be nice to have - currently a lot of our app depends on a sidebar. We end up using ng-sidebar - but the quality is often spotty and updates unreliable.\nIF you consider this - make sure to have a option for non fixed sidebar that could be placed inside a container (like relative parent and absolute sidebar).\nA vertical scrollbar would be nice if contents do not fit  - instead of stretching the whole page (or leave room to customize it with css).\nAnother major issue with hiding overflows is that it ends up clipping dropdown menus etc - perhaps you can find a solution to that as well?\nSeparate template able header (where close button is - so we could add extra buttons like toggle for wider sidebar etc).\n. Since it has no documentation yet - does it use \"fixed\" display or relative-absolute?\nFor example could i put it inside the \"Documentation\" tab in the demo above?\nDoes it close when clicked outside?\nOr provides a attribute to toggle and implement the open/close ourselves?. That looks normal - because you did not select individual row.\nThere is a separate event \"onHeaderCheckboxToggle\" for header.\nIt doesn't return a list of selected items tho.\nBefore this event it also fires \"selectionChange\" wit ha list of selected items.. It unfortunately does not return affected rows. Perhaps selectionChange would work better in this case - you get a list of selected items and both rows/header fire it.\n. Firing large number of onRowSelects there would be bad for performance (in my case that would be up to 30 thousand events in some cases). \nGlobal select would return an array most likely even if they add something new, which would not help you much. This is where data stores become useful to store states etc (like ngrx).. Just end up with this problem aswell. Needing to differentiate different data sources wit ha icon or color.\n. This bug is in your own site. Not mine - like on the link above. I can replicate it on multiple browsers\n\n. Confirmed, this issue exists in aot build.. Can close this issue. apparently investigating deeper, fontawesoem loader did not have \"animated\": true,. It listens to the document click - so i assume that is where the problem comes from.\nWhy not focusout or similar? This would cover any  action that causes focus to be lost (window resize included). Global click listener on document is problematic because often preventpropagation might be used in various places as well.. @reinpeter the issue linked does not mention the need for two clicks outside to close it. So it is not the same bug.. @Sumragen using empty string or null causes primeng to show text \"empty\".\nThis is from their source: \n<span *ngIf=\"!itemTemplate\">{{option.label||'empty'}}</span>\nEmpty string/null both equate to false.. But it still shows empty in the dropdown input.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/cSeR7SMdhvZqPaWzZ0BZ?p=preview. Showcase has one issue - open dropdown, click anywhere else (do not select anything) - and it wont close.\nSimilar close issue also shows up if you have it attached to body and router navigates somewhere else - dropdown remains open and wont close until you navigate back to the component where the dropdown is.\nPerhaps using focus/focusout to close it might be more reliable than outsideclick alone?. Does it provide access to paginator variables like:\n[rows]=\"rows\" [first]=\"first\" [totalRecords]=\"totalRecords\" [pageLinkSize]=\"pageLinks\"\nOr is it just static template that has no connection to the paginator itself? \nFor example:\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"paginatorLeft\" let-totalRecords=\"totalRecords\">{{totalRecords}}</ng-template>\n. This is unusual, i have the latest 4.3 datatable code i use to keep critical fixes in place - and i do not see any problems with my tables. \nif(rowData && this.selection && this.selection.length > 0). Doesn't this already exist when using pTemplate=\"emptymessage\" for styling.. @haris-s unlikely, since it was added in 5.0.1. How much backwards compatibility will it have  with old table? Since we use it around 9 different places, would they all have to be fully redesigned, different properties and setup logic or can old tables be migrated with some adjustments (keeping col definitions, templates, event handlers etc)?  \nAlso will it have a kind of click event prevention option (based of some condition, cancel selection/selection events - like onBeforeSelect or something)?  . The locale should at least extend the default (use properties in  component conf, rest should be default) - right now you have to  set up the entire locale object each time you use the component.\nRight now the calendar is in ~12 places - which means 12 times i'v had to to copy paste the locale object. \nThere does not seem to be a global way to set locale for primeng in appcomponent or appmodule for example.. Well this is a completely breaking change. I cannot migrate over to new table without this.. When this is implemented - could the time selector also be improved, clicking up and down arrows is a rather unusual approach instead of the usual ones (for material design you may see circular \"clock\" style or a scrollable list to choose value from). There is still a noticeable delay even at smaller amounts - a few thousand\ncan take 10-s of seconds.\nOn Wed, Jan 31, 2018 at 12:49 PM, \u00c7a\u011fatay \u00c7ivici notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIt is not a good engineering practice to load 22k to your user's browsers.\nYou should really use lazy loading for 22k entries as result will be\nthe same when you use a simple ngFor instead of p-table.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5020#issuecomment-361895322,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AYtBDGYBPaHs5hUEKCTduMFtw4VCuKi2ks5tQEUlgaJpZM4RyVVp\n.\n.

    "JacobSiegle": "Sorry I think I linked to the wrong issue. Seems like @cagataycivici closed this before that anyway, maybe i'll try to see how complicated it is to complete and PR it anyway.. Seems like it needs an additional CSS class for controlling the submenu so you will have to wait for a maintainer since they are the only ones who can change the theme CSS. Otherwise it's just adding the missing active state onto the ngClass in the sub panel component.. Seems like if this was implemented it would be useful in implementing #5213.. Thumbs down because the prev comment to cagataycivici asks about putting in a PR and he ignored it which means they must want to do it internally (also backed by \"Planned for 6.1.3.\") and will not accept a PR.\nIn the latest dev blog they state they have pushed it back to 7.0, \"big ticket new features like the new DialogService and OverlayPanel enhancements will be in 7.0.0\".. Nevermind this is a result of angular dirty checking during change detection I believe.. #6506 fixed but the PR was denied.. Thanks! Didn't have enough time to look into it yet also but can confirm changing the overflow does fix the issue, I overrode it in my component for now.. See notes in https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/2388. The only fix for now is to statically set the height of your cells or remove text wrap as far as i'm aware.. The details of the tree table are shared here for anyone interested. \nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng-5-2-5-released/. Old issue that was probably fixed at some point but seems to have broken again. I get this issue migrating from primeng 6.1.5 to 7.1.0-rc.1. Copy and paste into a key filter for numbers previously worked.. Having the same issue on Angular 5.2.X using Primeng 5.2.0-rc.2 from input switch. Tried his plunker replacing 5.0.0 with 5.2.0 and got the same result.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/mBxNY8ct9oVW92YGDGVc?p=preview. You explicitly put the header column to have a width of -\n<th style=\"width: 2.25em\">\nApply the same to the body - \n<td style=\"width: 2.25em\">\n        <p-tableCheckbox [value]=\"rowData\"></p-tableCheckbox>\n</td>\nLooks like a glitch in the turbo table docs that needs to be fixed, but is working as intended? I guess the question is when scrollable is put on should it explicitly try to sync with the table header since they are two different divs.. See https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4643, wouldn't expect a fix you will need to pick one of the suggested options in those notes.. See https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4369.. 5.2.0 is the last working version for a responsive chart with fixed height. Can this issue be opened again?\nIf height is specified or response mode is false can it be applied?\n[style.height]=\"responsive && height == null ? null : height\"\n[attr.height]=\"responsive && height == null ? null : height\". Put in https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/5858 to hopefully fix the issue with sizing in responsive mode and the doc errors.. The fix was merged into the ng 6 branches, so you need a newer version of PrimeNG or manually pull and include the fix yourself.. This seems patched in the newest 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT. Will confirm on release.. Fixed in 5.2.5. Thanks!. No, I don't think anything exists where you can optionally download a bundle like bootstrap. You have to build it yourself and include it in your project yourself. If you want to take things out just delete the files you don't want and the run the CLI to find all the refs to those files you need to remove.. Many components in dialog seem to be doing this. Hopefully a fix is coming soon - https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4982#issuecomment-362297771.. Include a plnkr in the future.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/CuHdSHeDRSE5Ge9jL14z?p=preview. The issue described happens when the dropdown renders below.\n\n\n. Like this?\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/nVmI13?p=preview\nI don't think this is a bug report as much as it is a question. Close?. Can you make a plunk to reproduce? Otherwise I can only assume it's an implementation error since it doesn't happen in the plunk shown above.. Growl is deprecated.. This isn't a bug report, read the docs. Please close.\n[inputStyle]=\"{'padding': '30px'}\". Tried to reproduce it by toggling display with ngIf and hidden. Neither had the same effect. Can you create a plunk to reproduce?. Same issue as https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5004.. Can't you just pipe the data in your model before you put it into the table? Why make the primeNG component do it?. There is no close event emitted? Use onShow and onHide. Read https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/sidebar.. Datatable is deprecated. It looks like it does work in the example doc. You won't get support for the old data table anymore.\nThis is a question not an issue from what I can tell, post here - https://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35. Please do not submit support request here, instead see http://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35.\nIf the button doesn't align it most likely is some of your other styles breaking it.. Works for me. When you click a free theme it changes the style in the docs, they don't have dedicated example pages like the others.\nI tried chrome, firefox, edge.. Might see if I can PR it. Comment bookmark. (Edit - Sounds like they would like to do significant changes to the turbo table internally). Is it fixed or am I setting something up incorrectly?\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-hzv69y. Looks like this was patched recently. Closing.. Seems to be fixed? Can you confirm and close if so?. Not patched on 5.2.5. Scroll bar appears over paginator on edge, FF, and chrome.\nPlunker seems broken now, so I created a stackblitz -\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-jd3niz. Seems like it's been fixed, can you confirm and if it's fixed close the issue.. Edit sorry fix - #6613. You can probably close #5801 which is the same issue but for checkboxes.. You need to set the width like the doc example.. I don't believe this is a glitch according to the docs. I think you should close this issue and open one asking for the ability to force only one item to be selected from the orderlist component. You can select multiple items on desktop by using the control key.\nHere's the note from the docs - \nWhen true metaKey needs to be pressed to select or unselect an item and when set to false selection of each item can be toggled individually. On touch enabled devices, metaKeySelection is turned off automatically.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/5858. #6613. I was going to also try to patch a different issue - https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/5485\nI assume this requires significant changes so I wont put a PR in. The nonfrozen view needs to alert the frozen view if the scrollbar exists and conditionally subtract the height in setScrollHeight instead of always subtracting it.\nif(this.frozen) {\n                    scrollBodyHeight -= this.domHandler.calculateScrollbarWidth();\n                }\nThanks for all the work you do, can't wait for the final 6 release!. Whatever [pSelectableRow]=\"rowData[1]\" and [value]=\"rowData[0]\" are is probably always the same value. \nThis is a question not an issue with the framework from a quick look. Try https://forum.primefaces.org/ if you need further assistance. Otherwise make a stackblitz if you still believe this is an error with the framework and not your code.. I run into the same issue and use a timeout to delay the PrimeNG component from loading which fixes it for my users (gives time for the captcha script to load).\nsetTimeout(() => {\n                this.showCaptcha = true;\n            }, 200)\nComment tag to look further into if I get time. PrimeNG component needs a hook to only attempt the captcha calls when the script is available.\n. This is a question not an issue. Consider closing and posting in the primeng forums for support instead.. EDIT: Never mind it works on one of my password components, but then not the other.\n. Schedule works with IE 11 for me using alpha 4.. Looks fixed in latest version.. Seems fixed in the latest build?\nEdit: Never mind failed the first step of using the calendar with navigators enabled. My bad.. Make a stackblitz to reproduce the issue so it can be debugged.. It seems like it been fixed besides in the old datatable component which is deprecated and should probably keep fa-spin. Can you confirm and close if so?. Seems easy to add - adding comment to tag, maybe I will have time to put a quick PR in.. You can say this about any of the components, the amount of additional logic that needs to be added isn't worth it. Why not just turn your array to a list of SelectItem where the label and value are the same thing?. Currently not possible as far as I can tell and it doesn't seem like there is any templating for inserting something on the left of the calendar.  New feature.. For quick ref - https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/setup. It seems like you could hack it by using paginatorright and paginatorleft while hiding the existing paginator buttons but it wouldn't really be the same.\nNew feature request from what I can see in the docs.. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6242. Please close.. https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/calendar - Read the doc. Questions should go to https://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=35.. I'm assuming in your actual code example the visible var and ngIf var are not the same. In this scenario can you not just remove the ngIf and change visible to [(visible)]=\"var1 && var2\"? I'm not sure onHide should be called with *ngIf because it isn't hidden it's destroyed.. Not sure what you mean about it jumping to the next element or even if this is a regression from previous PrimeNG versions, but setting 'user-select: none' on '.ui-chkbox-label' does prevent the checkbox label from being selected on double click.. Weird glitch, seems like it can be fixed by adding 'user-select: none' onto p-checkbox in chrome instead of the label.. Use the forums for questions - https://forum.primefaces.org/. Read the first line of the docs - https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table\nNot an issue, consider closing and using the forums instead.. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6210. You can still set the model state when the switch is disabled?\nhttps://github-tgxspa-62tzh6.stackblitz.io. Not sure why stackblitz is broken. I guess my question is how is setting the ngModel state and disabled to true any different then readonly mode?. Somehow didn't notice duplicated issue - https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6342. This is a question and is about how to use ChartJS not PrimeNG. Only bug reports should be posted here. Consider closing.\nMultiple answers to this question already -\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/36992922/chart-js-v2-how-to-make-tooltips-always-appear-on-pie-chart. Duplicate of #6210 and #6307. Consider closing.. There is no example of the issue given but I would assume you need to use appendTo and body. See the table docs.. This is a duplicate of #2318.. I think this is very similar to your changes in ad02228 but I haven't had time to look through the entire set of changes you made. I'll let you close it. Thanks!. https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bubble.html\nQuestion not an issue.. PrimeNG is only a thin wrapper around ChartJS. You can find many issues how to implement this by searching online for ChartJS.\nThis is a question not an issue and should be closed. Post questions on the primeng forum.. I'm unsure of what you're saying the issue is here, but if you want a min column size set the col group?\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"colgroup\" let-columns>\n        <colgroup>\n            <col style=\"width:250px\">\n            <col style=\"width:250px\">\n            <col style=\"width:250px\">\n            <col style=\"width:250px\">\n            <col style=\"width:250px\">\n            <col style=\"width:250px\">\n        </colgroup>\n    </ng-template>. I would assume you must not of set the cols prop on many of these tables and they are hard coded like in the example otherwise it would seem like an easy fix to just add the colgroup with an ngFor for all the tables.\nSince the scrollable table is detached on the head and body I believe there would need to be some sort of sync where it has to scan the header cols (which would still require you to set the cols prop which brings us back to my prev note), figure out a min length based on the text sizing (?), and pass it to the head and body table to setup each cols min length. \nHonestly it seems easiest to me to just suggest setting the colgroup as I mentioned earlier instead of possible performance issues and complexity of trying to sync the state of the col min widths between two tables. You'll have to wait for @cagataycivici maybe he knows some other way to work around your issue i'm not seeing.. The tables that have the feature you're talking about (like your bootstrap example) are simple tables that do not have to implement all the features the primeng table has like a floating header, frozen cols, etc. I believe this isn't a bug but a defect from a design choice to make all those features work in a single component. When they chose to use multiple tables for the header, body, frozen body, etc when scrollable is enabled they made a disconnected between the tables and it's not easily possible to sync up the expected col widths automatically. That's why setting the colspan is the fix they suggest, because they can take that colspan and stick it into every table they make to make them all match up. The old p-datatable worked the same way, they rewrote the file into turbo table and they made the same design choice and it has the same defect.\nThere are a number of other issues closed that say the same thing where the col widths don't match up and they suggest setting the colgroup because they cannot sync the width of the cols between the two tables unless you set the colgroup -\n4927, #5041. OK maybe you can provide the library that has similar features to PrimeNG as I mentioned earlier like scroll, float header, frozen cols, frozen rows, etc and they could look at the design architecture of that library and see how they are syncing up the col widths and possibly port it over here.\nEdit - I looked at a few multiple online frameworks the biggest being KendoUI and Ng-Zorro. They both have the same issue. \"Workaround is hack fix\" is not true, I don't see how setting the columns is a hack.. Duplicate of #5550. The easiest way is to just copy the old version of schedule.ts that matches up with the V3 version and include/build it as your own component in your project.\nSince this is sort of a question and not an issue with primeng (but with full calendar) I assume they will mark it as resolved and suggest you post to the primeng forums.. I don't think your issue is the same bug as #5485 but is related. In #5485 the table would always render incorrectly. In the newer versions it only renders incorrectly when resizing happens. Maybe you can retest and see if that is the case for you also, because you mentioned Firefox works but it's not working correctly for me when resizing. Both Firefox and Chrome do work correctly first render.. 1 - It's checking the view width because if the width is larger then the scroll container that means a scroll bar will exist on the bottom and if a scroll bar exists on the bottom it needs to offset the height to match up with the unfrozen part.\n2 - Looking at ngAfterViewChecked I see it checks a var called initialized. When initialized is set setScrollHeight is not being called again. The issue with the responsiveness is that it needs to call setScrollHeight when the view changes since it possibly cannot have a scrollbar anymore. They have something similar to the needed call in the file where they are subscribing to col changes and running setScrollHeight.\nI don't know if fixing either of those will fix whatever is wrong with pierfreeman table because the primeNG docs example seem to work in the scenario he's saying his doesn't. I think we would need a stackblitz to look into why his doesn't work.\nIf you would like to try to PR a fix you can, I don't like PRing for turbo table.. It also seems like if the table is hidden (maybe you show a loading screen) the scrollbar will be misaligned, wild guess that's pierfreeman issue.. Edit: Seems latest master is same as below I ran for 6.1.4.\n1) https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/scroll\n2) Go to the table labeled \"Frozen Columns\". \n3) Maximize your screen until the table frozen column has no scroll bar.\n4) Scroll the entire table confirm all the rows line up.\n5) Shrink the screen until the scrollbar appears.\n6) Scrollbar should be misaligned on the table.\n7) Reload the webpage at the same width\n8) Scroll to the table again and see the scrollbar now works properly.\n9) Maximize the table again until the scrollbar vanishes\n10) Confirm the LHS frozen column is misaligned.\n. The fix only solves problems with the first render, which probably covers most issues. It does not fix scrollbars appearing / disappearing when using a responsive website.\nFirst render - \n\nOpening a row to make the table have vertical scroll causes the RHS scrollbar to overlap the data - \n\nResizing the columns to fit the screen causes extra space to exist on the bottom of the table when the horizontal scrollbar is removed - \n. My previous comment is incorrect. First render is broken in a different way. First render fails when you have a scrollable table that happens to not scroll due to lack of rows. The padding is always put onto the bottom of the table no matter what.\n\n. It seems to me like it works if I change the code to -\n@ViewChild(\"dialog1\") dialog1;\n@ViewChild(\"dialog2\") dialog2;\nOr am I mistaken and it's some other sort of error?. Fork primeng and make the fix needed in your forked repo then publish to npm. I don't think you'll get any support for how old your primeng version is, they currently don't even take new feature PRs. \nThis is a question and should be posted in the primeng forums it's not an issue. Consider closing and moving your post if you need more feedback.. Put a PR in for this earlier - #6608.. Let me know if you would like me to merge with master, 46afe28 was patched in the last day and isn't in a release yet.. I don't really understand the value of the change here unless I don't understand correctly. \nTo get this to work you would have to bind to the dropdown the prop you wanted like [dropdownPropToGet]=\"Pizza.Topping\", it seems like just as much work compared to what you have to do now which is pulling the property out of the selected item yourself with code like selectedItem.value.Pizza.Topping.. I was also thinking about trying to PR #1701, but let me know if I shouldn't I see it was mile stoned at one point.. This is a question not an issue you should post it to the PrimeNG forums not here. If you already know the cols you want just provide only them to the table and add the others later.. You can still find datatable on the website but it's hidden - https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable\nI think the only way to pull an old version of the docs right now would to be to pull from git and load it up yourself on localhost.. This is a question and not an issue it should not be posted here use the primeng forum. To solve your problem just get a ref to the table in your component and call exportCSV on it manually which also will give you the ability to show popups. . Seems to work fine for me using IE 11.345.17134.0.\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/scroll. The notes are on the blog - https://www.primefaces.org/blog/. This is a question not an issue please consider closing and using the primeng forum in the future for questions instead.. Is the demo working? Nothing is happening when I click the A-F buttons in Firefox or Chrome.. Seems OK to me - \n\n. This doesn't seem like an issue with primeNG but a bug in your file setup. I don't think you will get support if you are using PrimeNG 5.x, it's too out of date. You should post this question to the forums.\nIf you make a stackblitz of the issue I could try to debug it for you. . Please create a stack-blitz replicating the issue. I did not see the issue when pasting the code you provided in stack-blitz.. Thanks but you shared the embedded view meaning anyone using that link cannot see the code editor.. It seems like a bug with PrimeNG 6.0, I tried PrimeNG 6.1.5 and it works correctly. If you upgrade your PrimeNG version it will be fixed.. I don't know an easy fix off the top of my head, I assume any fix would be a hacky workaround for this. \nThe reason the scroll position resets in the newer version is that the panel popup is removed from the DOM. In the older versions the panel popup was just hidden and remained in the DOM.. I'm using the latest version of PrimeNG and the button component disabled but this works.\n[disabled]=\"returnUserFn()\">\nreturnUserFn(): boolean {\n  return new Date().getDay() == 5;\n}\nIf it doesn't work for you please try to recreate your stack-blitz, it throws a 404 for me.. Do you have an example of what the positioning issue is? I tried it again on every component that uses relativePosition and it seems to work as i'm expecting. Maybe you just want the overlay calc to be more complex instead of just cutting the left in half?. When you use pTemplate=\"selectedItems\" it gives you full control of what is displayed in the multiselect which means defaultLabel and maxSelectedLabel props no longer apply. It seems like this is an intended feature. You could use a copy of their code to reproduce the same effect -\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/8a646356bb8f67f4d4275b3b954853dfe21e0d84/src/app/components/multiselect/multiselect.ts#L518. Please try to replicate on the latest version of PrimeNG. I don't believe they support versions as old as 5.0.2. You will have to maintain a fork yourself if you need a version that old.. So why don't you include moment in your project then? This is a question not an issue, it shouldn't be posted here. Try the PrimeNG forums.. Your config is wrong then, I just tested in quickly in stack-blitz and it works to show dates and times using moment. Please make a stack-blitz if to replicate the issue if you still believe it's an issue with PrimeNG.. I use a much thinner wrapper which does the same thing but allows you to load maps at any point - \nhttps://github.com/yuanqing/load-google-maps-api/blob/master/index.js\nThe exact page for referenced above functionality -\nhttps://github.com/SebastianM/angular-google-maps/blob/master/packages/core/services/maps-api-loader/lazy-maps-api-loader.ts. I believe this is an issue with the state of the overlay panel which is described in the following issue - https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6921\nIf the overlay panel properly destroyed the inner component when it's closed the state would be working.. Makes sense, not sure how I overlooked that. Thanks!. Seems like a bug. Comment tagged.. I run into the the same issue. Ref for fix - https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/3b54f9a517a6a41558c9e4eac8655bea0d5afde3/src/app/components/table/table.ts#L1408. In your example you have 3 frozen columns set \"vin, year, color\". In the html you have the frozen width set to frozenWidth=\"400px\". In the colgroup you have the width set to 200px for every column which equals 600px of space. If you set the col width to 133 or the frozen width to 600 all the frozen columns will appear.. https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-jzz1ht\nTo replicate -\n1) Open the overlay by clicking the button.\n2)  Hover over the button in the overlay which will show the tooltip. \n3) Click outside the overlay on the right side.\n4) The overlay will begin to close since you clicked outside.\n5) Quickly move your mouse back on top of the button in the closing overlay.\n6) The tooltip will still be showing (like the screenshot above) even when the overlay has been removed.. Upon further investigation it seems like this is caused due content projection by the overlayPanel (https://bit.ly/2zUW1h4) and the fix is to use ngTemplateOutlet like the turbo table does. Currently it seems like overlayPanel will leak memory from failure to call life cycle looks (correctly me if this is wrong) which is also why the tooltip will stick around because onDestory isn't being called. \nI don't think I can attempt to fix this any further due to significant changes it needs (new overlayPanel component).. I'm assuming this can happen with other components, but calendar is breaking when being used in overlay due to this bug.\nOpen the overlay, open the calendar, while both have the popup shown click on the page body -> calendar won't open again.\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-wvne9h. Some other components i've tested - \nDropdown, multiselect, color picker will require double click for it to open.\np-dialog perma breaks like calendar.. I cannot tell for sure without a stackblitz, but try adding the \"appendTo\" property to the split button and append it to body.. Similar issue to what is described in #6560 where the widths effected by the scroll bars are not being continuously calculated.. This is a question not an issue. Please use the PrimeNG forums for support and close this issue.. An regular button which triggers an overlay panel with a dropdown inside seems more intuitive to me.\nIf you wanted to do it the way described I think it would work to get a ref to the component and catch the command button being clicked via \"onClick\" and then use the ref to the component to manually call \"show\" which will show the dropdown.. It sounds like an issue with your code unless you can provide a stackblitz for the latest version of PrimeNG which can reproduce the issue. I've been using multiselect inside of form tags since the earliest version of PrimeNG without an issue. Please consider closing if you cannot provide a stackblitz.. Seems just as fast in IE 11 as any other browser. Please make a stackblitz to reproduce the issue and please report the version of IE you're attempting to use.\nIf you go to https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/calendar and it's not slow, it's an issue with your app.. Relates to #7020 which sounds like an issue with their app. Please provide a stackblitz otherwise.. You can just use \"onSelect\" on the first calendar and change the ngModel of the other? Seems like a question unless i'm missing something. Please consider closing or producing a stackblitz.. If you are using the old themes from an old primeng version (aka 4.2.1), I don't think you'll get any support.. This is not possible with the calendar. I don't think they will add it.. PrimeNG version: 4.3.0 - Please confirm this is an issue in the latest version of PrimeNG. As far as I know they don't support older versions.. You're referring to https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/dialog ? It works fine for me in IE 11, can you reproduce in a stack-blitz?. Duplicates - #6441, #4477, #4041. #7085 sounds like it could fix it also, I checked the react version and it does work on mobile.. Please create a stack-blitz recreating the issue.. The docs include virtual scroll - https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/table/scroll. The doc example does use lazy and virtual scroll. It should be relatively easy to include the virtual scroll if you already have lazy loading set up because it's the same callback for lazy loading.\n<p-table [columns]=\"cols\" [value]=\"virtualCars\" [scrollable]=\"true\" [rows]=\"20\" scrollHeight=\"200px\" [virtualScroll]=\"true\" (onLazyLoad)=\"loadDataOnScroll($event)\"\n    [lazy]=\"true\" [totalRecords]=\"totalRecords\" [virtualRowHeight]=\"34\"  [loading]=\"loading\">\nIf you need further support you should ask on the PrimeNG forums. This doesn't sounds like an issue but a question. Please correct me if i'm wrong.. Comment tag - Works fine on last 6.1.7 - Quick ref open https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/multiselect on mobile.. Doesn't it make more sense in this scenario to not use the label property of the checkbox and just align text with an anchor tag next to the check box?\nAdditionally right now when you use the label with the checkbox clicking the label toggles the checkbox status and your request would conflict with this feature.. I don't think it's possible to print without rending all the elements.. Sounds like an error with your code or I do not understand the issue. If you need further support please try the primeng forums.\n\n. Auto width was removed in the latest version of primeng.. This a generic angular question not an issue with primeng. Please ask on the primeng forums in the future.\n\n. This is a question not an issue. Try the primeng forums instead.. Duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/7125. Please create a stack-blitz. It's hard to debug what the issue is without the table data you're trying to filter.. Thanks i'll close the issue. My initial confusion was because if you change the example stackblitz to a string[] and turn off binary mode you can force the checkbox to stay checked / unchecked when performing nearly the same code. The flaw I didn't realize was when testing I was assigning a new array value which forces \"writeValue\" to run again since it will catch the change to the input. Change detection errors never popup for this, i'm assuming it has something to do with the way ControlValueAccessor works but would need to dig deeper to be sure of the exact cause.. This isn't easily possible and I cannot really see them adding it as a new feature. \nTo manually do it you would need to get a ref to the dropdown in the paginator and then override the functionality.. This is a question not an issue. It should be posted to the primeng forum instead.\nIf you search the docs for the table you can find this code - \n<p-table [value]=\"sales\" [scrollable]=\"true\" scrollHeight=\"150px\" frozenWidth=\"200px\">\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"frozenheader\">\n        <tr>\n            <th style=\"width:200px;height:84px\">Brand</th>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"frozenbody\" let-sale>\n        <tr>\n            <td>{{sale.brand}}</td>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"header\">\n        <tr>\n            <th colspan=\"4\">Sale Rate</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th colspan=\"2\">Sales</th>\n            <th colspan=\"2\">Profits</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Last Year</th>\n            <th>This Year</th>\n            <th>Last Year</th>\n            <th>This Year</th>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n    <ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-sale>\n        <tr>\n            <td>{{sale.lastYearSale}}</td>\n            <td>{{sale.thisYearSale}}</td>\n            <td>{{sale.lastYearProfit}}</td>\n            <td>{{sale.thisYearProfit}}</td>\n        </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n</p-table>. Growl is deprecated. If you use p-toast it has this feature.\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/toast. I don't think PrimeNG supports older versions, maybe they do if you have primeng pro or something. I would assume you could fork primeng or manually pull and include toast as a separate import.. I think this is the intended behavior. If the calendar thinks it won't fit on the view it renders on top of the input to have more room. You can verify this by creating enough space for the calendar to fully fit on the page.\nEdit: You can use touch UI to help avoid this for mobile devices.\n\n. Seems fixed, going to assume rc-1 did something. PrimeNG hasn't had a compatible release for Angular 8 yet.. ",

Maybe that can help you figure out the problem. \nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2152\n. I have the same problem with 4.0, which I didn't with rc3. I noticed that the way to make it work is to empty out (messages =[]) the messages array passed to the growl.

Thanks a lot I missed that flag. . I came across this also. As they explained this is by design and if you set the property [metaKeySelection]=\"false\" on p-listbox you can achieve your desired behavior. . Thanks for the comment. \nI opened up the paginator.js in primeng and I found that compared to ts file it does not have the first page check. Here is the code for changePageToFirst in pagnator.js\nPaginator.prototype.changePageToFirst = function (event) {\n    this.changePage(0, event);\n};\n\nI don't understand how the ts file is different from js file.

Once i removed them it started working fine.\n So there is no issue with overlay panel.\nThanks cagataycivici !. +1\n. but we can not insist users to do the same...they come to application to do certain things but not to check Menubar carefully :(. I have an input on this issue, \n<ul class=\"ui-menu-list ui-widget-content ui-corner-all ui-helper-clearfix ui-menu-child ui-shadow\" style=\"left: 0px; z-index: 1025;top:28px\">\nFor child there is a inline style top:28px  this is causing the issue. If i remove this then it is working fine in IE. I looked for this style in the source code  but i dnt see anywhere this linline style...Any help on this would be appreciated greatly...thanks\n. git this fixed, \nif(this.root) {\n                //sublist.style.top = this.domHandler.getOuterHeight(item.children[0]) + 'px';\n                sublist.style.left = '0px'\n            }\n            else {\n                //sublist.style.top = '0px';\n                sublist.style.left = this.domHandler.getOuterWidth(item.children[0]) + 'px';\n            }\nI have commented out top style property. It is working fine IE11 & chrome 61.0.3163.79\nIn my case i only have one level sub-menu so i am ok with this code commented out.. ",
    "cosnochic": "appendTo=\"body\"  works better for me. Only thing is - The content shows up on the left side when I need it on the right side. Anyone know how to do this?. ",
    "jonbarthol": "@cagataycivici it would be nice if p-overlayPanel could do relative positioning like p-dropdown. Using appendTo=\"body\" doesn't work well in the case the p-overlayPanel is inside a p-dialog. This causes z-index problems where the p-overlayPanel ends up underneath the p-dialog.\nI was able to do my own relative positioning by setting \"willShow\" to false immediately after calling \"show().\" I then called domHandler.relativePosition().. Thanks. It's nice to have a workaround. However, it's unfortunate that you have to set [autoAlign]=\"false\" as @Treynis stated above. Doing this does not allow the dialog to recenter itself after the height is dynamically changed.\nThere is an \"off by one pixel\" problem with either Angular or the browser that causes the height of the containerViewChild to vary by one pixel every time ngAfterViewChecked is called. This only seems to be a problem when the viewport height is an odd number of pixels. @cagataycivici what do you think of changing the \"if\" condition in ngAfterViewChecked from: \nif(height !== this.currentHeight)\nto:\nif(height < this.currentHeight - 1 || height > this.currentHeight + 1)\nThis would resolve the \"off by one pixel\" problem. Thanks.. The Plunkr example posted by @mroskamp may not load. Here's the same example on StackBlitz:\nhttps://datascroller-bug.stackblitz.io\nI opened a new issue: #5816 . Thank you, @starlightknight. Chrome has fixed this in build 63.0.3239.59, which is available in Beta. I just downloaded the Beta version and am no longer seeing the error.. This is related to #593. @cagataycivici said he would create a new issue for the \"subitem positioning\" but I don't see a newly created issue for this.. This is still a bug. I just replicated the issue on the demo page again. I opened a new issue #5878 with a video showing the problem.. @pekevski yes, removing the 250 milliseconds from setTimeout resolves the issue.. onClick of an item. Thanks again.. ",

I tried to do that it indeed all rows got selected but then the checkbox in the head is shown as unchecked. Unfortunately I couldn't reproduce the issue in Plunker because I have troubles importing PrimeNG into it. Do you have a barebone Plunker + PrimeNG, which I can try to play with?\n. @saverett Thanks for your effort. You solution will definitely help me. Hopefully it will be merged into the component and we don't have to worry about it any more :). You guys are amazing! Thanks a lot!\n. Unfortunately it seems that multiple selection is broken as well.\n. I also work on an app that depends on selecting and unselecting rows, because I use it to show some buttons. After rc.4 this behavior is broken. I also noticed that it is not possible to select multiple rows just by clicking on them (as it was before). \n. I think I fixed that in my PR #1330 \n. I don't know if you've seen it but there's Building From Source page in the Wiki. \nIn there you can read more about running PrimeNG locally (but it's pretty much what you suggest) :)\n. Well, it's mentioned in that page...\n\nPrimeNG package.json configuration is in distribution mode by default, meaning there are no dependencies defined to run the samples.\n\nI think the reason is because you usually include PrimeNG as a dependency in your App's main package.json file. Therefore there's no need for adding those dependencies in again.\n. This is not a bug. It is intended to be that way. It's discussed in this thread.\n. It is working fine now. They updated the page around an hour or so ago so you must've encountered a minor \"hiccup\" :). Why don't you just add a CSS class and control it from there? :). @Thavarajan You can simply add the class by specifying styleClass.\njavascript\n<p-dataTable [value]=\"cars\">\n    <p-column field=\"vin\" styleClass=\"column-1\" header=\"Vin\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"year\" styleClass=\"column-2\" header=\"Year\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"brand\" styleClass=\"column-3\" header=\"Brand\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"color\" styleClass=\"column-4\" header=\"Color\"></p-column>\n</p-dataTable>\nAnd you might not even need that at all. \nYou can simply use a CSS selector  \ncss\ntable thead th:nth-child(1) {\n  width: 10%;\n}\n(for first column) and so on ...\nOr you can do it directly on the <p-column>\n<p-column field=\"vin\" [style]=\"{'width':'10%'}\" header=\"Vin\"></p-column>. One easy way is to just change your CSS to td.text-right and that should do it. This will only target td inside tbody.\nAnother one is to add a template of type body inside the column and then wrap the value in an element with class text-right.. The unselect happens only when you hold Ctrl + click on the row (on desktop). On mobile works just by taping. This was implemented in one of the RCs. . It actually mimics the way Windows works. Try selecting an item and unselecting it :)\nAnyway, on a web app it can be intuitive. One way is to make the selection with a radio button instead of clicking on the whole row.\nAnother way is to just rely on the mouse cursor being changed to a hand for indicating clicking. . Have you considered making a PR? It's a perfect case for contributing something :)\nAnyway I fixed that in #1488 ;). @cagataycivici Any plans on this for a future version?. Since I open the issue I managed to implement my own folder upload and am therefore not interested in this feature anymore. You can close the issue if you want.\nHowever I still think it will be a good addition to PrimeNG and am encouraging you to consider it.\nThe way I implemented is by checking for webkitGetAsEntry function on the event.dataTransfer object. Something like this:\n```\nlet dataTransfer = event.dataTransfer;\nif (dataTransfer.items && dataTransfer.items[0] && dataTransfer.items[0].webkitGetAsEntry) {\n    // Supports folder upload\n  } else {\n    // Supports only file upload\n}\n```\nHope you find it helpful. . It is probably because dataTransfer is not supported on IE9.. I'm sorry but I haven't used IE9 for years and don't even have it. So I can't really help with this one.. It is actually applied but maybe not in the way you think it should be. If you take a look at Facets you can see that ui-datatable-header is applied to the row that contains List of Cars (which is wrapped in header element). Why don't you just use {{castData(item.vin)}}? And if that is your final function you can skip it all together and just write {{item.vin}}_Cast.. This isn't something related to PrimeNG. This is Agular's change detection. Here's a similar example. Hope it helps. Currently pressing almost any button (e.g. Esc ) will trigger an event. It will be useful to discard some of them.. I'm experiencing the same issue. It will be amazing of you can fix it! . The fix is pretty simple. I've already submitted a PR. Now it's up to the\nmaintainers to decide if they're going to merge it.\n@sviswanathjcet this feature is working fine. The problem is that it's\nbound to valueChange and not to onValueChange, which is mentioned in\nthe docs.\nOn Sat, Oct 14, 2017, 03:26 Angular notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCan you work on this issue as high priority?

Here you can find the docs for DataTable. If you need a different component just look at the sidebar.. > What is your use case here? What is the difference between onValueChange and valueChange?\n\nI don't have a use case. I just noticed that there's a difference between the documentation and the implementation and decided to make a PR with a fix. \nI can see here in GitHub that the valueChange event was added to the DataTable 3 months ago (August 7th). The documentation for that property was added by you later that day. . Sure. That's fine :). I \u201csuffered\u201d from the same thing. Turns out if you just import from primeng/primeng the final bundle with include some stuff you haven't used. I fixed that by including directly the components that I was using. Something like\nimport { DataTableModule } from 'primeng/components/datatable/datatable';\nSure it's a bit more hassle but now I don't include the whole \u201cjungle\u201d :D \nYou can also refer to this post in the forum.. What's wrong with only using CSS to do that? Here's a quick example.. I don't think it's necessary to overwrite any CSS. You can add your own only to a specific dataTable component. By specifying style or styleClass properties on a dataTable you can add either inline CSS or a custom class, which you can use in your CSS style sheet. Take a look at the Properties table in the documentation. . @Galiza Why don't you put a class on the dataTable with styleClass and then use that class in your CSS.\nSomething like:\n```\n.myDataTable tr button {\n  display: none;\n}\n.myDataTable tr:hover button {\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n```. @Galiza I've created a simple a Plunkr example showing a way to do what you need (at least that's the way I understood it from your description).\nThe important thing to note is encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None inside the app/app.component.ts file. Removing this line will make the button not show on hover.\nThe reason this is working is because encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None disables the style encapsulation, which Angular applies on every component.. Since you have access to the variable that you use in the [(ngModel)] property why don't you clear it instead? Here I put together a simple Plunkr example. And in that clear method you can also execute other code as well. . ",

For now I'll try to implement @izll 's workaround.  @izll , could you spare an example of how and where you catch those events?\n. Thanks @izll !  Of course this workaround is only good as a temporary workaround indeed. \nYou could also use HostListener to catch these events \"the angular way\" and use it only on the relevant component.\nDigging around the code I noticed the datatable handles change detection by it's own.. calling this complex change detection logic for every mouse move seems insane to me.\nChanging this method to perform reference comparison is my temporary fix - I still have great lag so I have to dig more, but it's much better than before.\n.

    "ribizli": "I think, the problem is more general in primeng. It's about setting the ui-state-* classes for stylings. Every mouse enter and leave event kicks in a change detection phase. This can cause big cpu usage on a comppex page.\nI think this is a bad legacy from the jquery based css of primefaces, where supporting older browsers was a goal.

I have the following usecase: multi select with checkboxes and default action on row click, The action opens the record in a new route. So it is not possible to do selection on the table because we navigate away.\n. Yes, as stated in the title... If selectionMode is defined on the table (not on column) my usecase makes no sense.\n. What if there isn't a suitable dataKey? At least that shoud support a function input to use identity... . I've read your answer too late,  sorry. . My former tsconfig.json was containeng a lib entry (borrowed from angular-cli):\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"], <-- check out this\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\"\n  }\n}\nIn this case the dependency @types/core-js (!!!not the polyfill, just the typing) is not needed for typescript compiler.\nHowever the current RC.1 version of PrimeNG *.d.ts files reference the core-js typings (wasn't the case before):\n/// <reference types=\"core-js\" />\nThis causes the error with my build.\nMy solution/workaround is now to also use @types/core-js and leave out the lib settings form the tsconfig.json.\n. My current solution is, that I patch Calendar's onInput method:\n@ViewChild(Calendar) private _calendar: Calendar;\n  ngOnInit() {\n    if (this._calendar) {\n      let origOnInput = this._calendar.onInput;\n      this._calendar.onInput = (event) => {\n        this._inputFieldValue = event.target.value;\n        origOnInput.call(this._calendar, event);\n      };\n    }\n  }\nNext I do validation based on the fact that the model value is null but there is something entered in the input.\n. I've reproduced the issue outside PrimeNG (see my comment on the original issue on angular), and also found a workaround: reference the row expansion template in DataTable either by a directive or by name.\nActually I've already added an issue about this long time ago: #966 \n. Guys! I just warn you, the fix of this and #966 might be a future breaking change if you do after final release.. It's still not working: http://embed.plnkr.co/bJ0ln941VPbUX7KP3Mtk/\nFrom the 2nd opening it messes up the template variables.\nI don't say, that this is not an angular issue, but can be avoided when not using TemplateRef but some more specific.. I've opened a new issue for this. . I've figured this out already, mentioned in every issue I've created.. This is definitely not the case, see #1366. This is still the same issue from #966. \nSee also #1366 for an other strange problem.. With your current solution (which I haven't tested btw) you take the first child, so location indeed matters.. Related: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13080. We are still sitting on the 2.1 version of angular, and cannot get rid of some already fixed router bugs because this is a blocking issue. I see that you are waiting for the fix from angular team (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13118, https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/13167), but the workaround would be so desired.. I went currently an other direction: since angular 2.3 supports annotation inheritance, I crated a subclass of DataTable which uses template alias to query the expansion template:\nexport class MyDataTable extends DataTable {\n  @ContentChildren('expansion') rowExpansionTemplate: QueryList<TemplateRef<any>>;\n}\nAnd instead of using the primeNG's DataTableModule I declare my implementation in my module.. This issue can be closed, I guess. Thanks.. This issue is solved, can be closed.\nBut let me point out an other blocking issue for us: #1600. @danicomas what? primeng devs have fixed the issue using pTemplate directive.. Couldn't make it for 1.1.1 ;( \nWe need to stick to 1.0.1 and using the workaround of the other issue with rowExpansion (#1413).. I'm also desperately waiting for the fix, this is a blocking issue for us, too, keeping us on version 1.0.1. I hope this wasn't forgotten just it is holiday season now.. I'm not sure that the default implementation makes it:\nrowTrackBy: Function = () => {};\nBecause now everything is tracked by undefined, which is returned from the function above. Angular uses the identity function as default.\ntrackByIdentity = (index: number, item: any) => item;\nA haven't had time to test this, but I'm pretty sure this can make some performance problems, since DefaultIterableDiffer cannot really track for changes.. This issue is a blocking issue for us, too. This is a critical issue, existing for 18 day already, and 3 new versions were already released (1.1.2-4) since it's reported. We are still on 1.0.1 because each version of primeng introduces a new blocking bug for us. I think the most powerful feature of primeng is the datatable, it deserves more attention by the developers.. @cagataycivici, any plan to release this? I see 2.0, but when it is planned? We are still on 1.0.1 due to several issues were introduced during fixing others, which is nonsense. . Check out our wrapper, which does support NG validation:\n```\nimport { Component, forwardRef, ViewChild, ExistingProvider, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR, ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALIDATORS, AbstractControl, Validator } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { Calendar } from 'primeng/primeng';\nconst CUSTOM_CALENDAR_CONTROL_VALUE_ACCESSOR: ExistingProvider = {\n  provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\n  useExisting: forwardRef(() => CalendarComponent),\n  multi: true\n};\nconst CALENDAR_VALIDATOR: ExistingProvider = {\n  provide: NG_VALIDATORS,\n  useExisting: forwardRef(() => CalendarComponent),\n  multi: true\n};\n@Component({\n  selector: 'pst-calendar',\n  template: <p-calendar #calendar [(ngModel)]=\"date\"\n      [disabled]=\"disabled\"\n      (onBlur)=\"onBlur($event)\"></p-calendar>,\n  providers: [CUSTOM_CALENDAR_CONTROL_VALUE_ACCESSOR, CALENDAR_VALIDATOR]\n})\nexport class CalendarComponent implements ControlValueAccessor, Validator, OnInit {\nconstructor() { }\n_date: Date;\n  get date() {\n    return this._date;\n  }\n  set date(date: Date) {\n    this._date = date;\n    this.onChange(date);\n  }\n@ViewChild(Calendar) private _calendar: Calendar;\n  private _inputFieldValue: string;\ndisabled: boolean;\nprivate onChange = (_) => { };\n  private onTouched = () => { };\nngOnInit() {\n    if (this._calendar) {\n      let origOnInput = this._calendar.onInput;\n      this._calendar.onInput = (event) => {\n        this._inputFieldValue = event.target.value;\n        origOnInput.call(this._calendar, event);\n      };\n    }\n  }\nvalidate(c: AbstractControl) {\n    if (this._calendar && this._inputFieldValue && this.date === null) {\n      return { invalidDate: true };\n    }\n  }\n  onBlur(event) {\n    this.onTouched();\n  }\n/ ControlValueAccessor methods /\n  writeValue(date: Date): void {\n    this._date = date;\n    if (!date) {\n      this._calendar.inputFieldValue = null;\n      this._inputFieldValue = null;\n    }\n  }\nregisterOnChange(fn: any): void {\n    this.onChange = fn;\n  }\nregisterOnTouched(fn: any): void {\n    this.onTouched = fn;\n  }\nsetDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {\n    this.disabled = isDisabled;\n  }\n}\n. Confirming: this issue is there still in the 2.0.0 version. I'm also trying to debug the issue. I think the problem is, that `writeValue` should directly modify the DOM, not expecting that changing `inputFieldValue`will be reflected in the view.\nIf you see how angular team implemented the [`DefaultValueAccessor`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/forms/src/directives/default_value_accessor.ts#L45-L48): they also do explicit DOM update:\nthis._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', normalizedValue);\nThe other solution would be using `ngModule`:\n<input #inputfield type=\"text\" pInputText [(ngModel)]=\"inputFieldValue\" ...\n```\nHope this analyse can help.. For others suffering from this bug, here is my patch which handles the situation:\n```\nif (Calendar.prototype.onInputFocus) {\n  const calendar = Calendar.prototype;\n  let oldOnInputFocus = calendar.onInputFocus;\n  calendar.onInputFocus = function(this: Calendar, inputfield, $event) {\n    this['$$inputfield'] = inputfield;\n    oldOnInputFocus.call(this, inputfield, $event);\n  }\nlet oldWriteValue = calendar.writeValue;\n  calendar.writeValue = function(this: Calendar, v) {\n    oldWriteValue.call(this, v);\n    if (this['$$inputfield']) {\n      this['$$inputfield'].value = this.inputFieldValue;\n    }\n  }\n}\n``. This issue is fixed since version2.0.4. Use TurboTable, you have control there.... @cagataycivici this is because angular'sng-content` is instantiated regardless the tab is shown or not. The laziness of your component means almost nothing now: only if it is rendered to DOM or not. But the components are already initiated consuming / requesting resources.\nPlease take this issue serious and also check the plnkr.. @cagataycivici \nSee this comment.\nPlease consider to use <ng-template> instead of transclusion.. I think here the issue is, that the list of options is filtered, and the by model set value is not inside. One should clear the filtering when writeValue is called by ngModel. http://plnkr.co/edit/jSU9gNtfq6UUMRLh0SIy?p=preview\nClick the button to toggle open/close. See how the animation overlaps the content after.. This wasn't a help request! This is definitely an issue. I'm reading the source code before reporting such issues, and believe me, I know what I'm doing.\np-dialog increases its zIndex on every mousedown (moveOnTop()), so it can happen soon that the DomHandler.zindex gets over the +100. After opening the next modal dialog, the toast will be already behind. Sure I could specify 1000 or 10000 for baseZIndex, but this it is just question of time when dialog's zIndex it gets over it.\nBut anyway the name autoZIndex of the input of p-toast suggests it will be maintained so, that it is always on top. But this is not the case, and so misleading. Currently this attribute has no real effect, only that initially a zIndex is set for the component. (Since toast is mostly a global component near to the root of the application tree, it is initiated early and once with the application start)\nI solved this issue currently in my app using a wrapper component and a workaround:\n```typescript\n  @ViewChild(Toast)\n  toast: Toast;\nngDoCheck() {\n      if (!(this.toast && this.toast.containerViewChild)) return;\n      const requiredZIndex = ${DomHandler.zindex};\n      const el = this.toast.containerViewChild.nativeElement as HTMLElement;\n      if (el.style.zIndex !== requiredZIndex) el.style.zIndex = requiredZIndex;\n  }\n``\nThe code above ensures that theToast` container is always above the dialog's mask.\nBut I think this logic should be in the Toast itself.\nSo please re-open this issue.. ",
    "httpdigest": "The solution we followed for this performance issue was to more-or-less implement a custom DataTable component ourselves, which uses a separate Angular 2 component for each row.\nThe problem with the PrimeNG DataTable is that for many columns and rows each template expression, generated in the DataTable template (using the ngFor loops), will need to be checked in each change detection cycle. The next problem in solving this was, that the PrimeNG DataTable itself is unable to support Angular 2 OnPush change detection, because it is just one component.\nTherefore, we used a custom \"row\" component with OnPush.\nThe next problem was that in Angular 2 each component's selector element, which is used to include that component in a parent's HTML/template, will always be rendered in the final HTML output and making a custom \"row\" element being a \\ element is not possible in Angular 2. To solve this we used a custom \\ element with a \"display: table-row;\" style to make it layout just like a table row \\ element.\n. I just sketched a possible solution for the performance problem, which we just implemented a simple scaffold for. This is in no way a complete solution that can readily replace the existing PrimeNG DataTable component in its functionality.\nMy hopes were that PrimeTek would pick up on the solution strategy and realize that in their own DataTable. Or that they just comment this ticket for once. :)\n. I second this!\nNavigation with keyboard in a data table (and also tree table) would be very useful in terms of accessibility and ergonomy.\n.

This was supported inherently by the datatable, but had to be programmed manually when using a normal JavaScript property lookup in the template via Angular's handlebars.\n. @dereklin Sure. The easiest solution in this case was just implementing a custom Angular 2 Pipe which does the dot-into interpretation with a pipe argument being the selector string.\nThis is the relevant portion of the template we are currently using:\nxml\n    <p-column ...>\n        <template let-row=\"rowData\" pTemplate type=\"body\">\n            <span>{{row | extractProperty:col.field}}</span>\n        </template>\n    </p-column>\nYou see here we are simply using a custom Angular 2 Pipe called \"extractProperty\" (in hindsight this could have probably named better).\nThe definition of the quickly prototyped pipe is as follows:\nJavaScript\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\n@Pipe({name: 'extractProperty'})\nexport class ExtractPropertyPipe implements PipeTransform {\n    transform(value: any, selector: string): string {\n        if (!selector) {\n            throw new Error('missing selector');\n        }\n        let dot = selector.indexOf('.');\n        let context = value;\n        let rest = selector;\n        while (dot > 0) {\n            if (!context) {\n                throw new Error('no object defined from which a property could be extracted');\n            }\n            let beforeDot = rest.substr(0, dot);\n            context = context[beforeDot];\n            rest = rest.substr(dot + 1);\n            dot = rest.indexOf('.');\n        }\n        if (!context) {\n            throw new Error('no object defined from which a property could be extracted');\n        }\n        return context[rest];\n    }\n}\nI take no responsibility for any crashes/malfunctioning that are due to bugs in that code. :). Adding the following to the package.json fixes all build issues:\njson\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/core\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/common\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"3.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"2.1.2\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"5.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"core-js\": \"2.4.1\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.6.26\"\n  },\n.

I have a simple question, should we move on with another grid or should we wait for possible solution?\nThere is really no use of having the most advanced datatable out there if nobody can use it for something more than a school project.. @brud Thanx for the tip, I do know that i can \"play\" with CDS and i have played with it. Unfortunately most of the primeng components are incompatible with OnPush strategy and you end up with open dropdowns and calendars that will not close until you hover them, fields that will not populate if you don't click/hover them etc. \nWhat I wanted was an answer from some of the guys behind PrimeNG actually. Also i would like to see IF the problem with the datatable is actually the changing CSS classes and it has nothing to do with the custom change detection implemented in the data table. . @cagataycivici was this fixed in the recent release?\n. This should be fixed on master branch https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/833#issuecomment-244219999\n. @ammar91 is this happening with the beta 15?\n. @ammar91 we haven't taken the plunge in AOT yet so I can't really help, sorry.

Can you reproduce this in plunker or paste some code here?\n. Angular 2 is no longer RC\n. @cagataycivici can you please just tell if this is not possible with the current implementation so i can move on \n. I still have the same issue beta20. Is it only me that is facing this?\n. Same behaviour in beta20\n. I have the same issue #1114 \n. There is emptyMessage property for the DataTable.\n. @cagataycivici is this fixed? I have exactly the same weird behaviour, it is like i don't even pass footer template:\nIs the below correct? Should it work?\ntypescript\n<p-column field=\"amount_due\" header=\"Due\" sortable=\"true\" filter=\"true\" [style]=\"{width: '100px'}\">\n    <template pTemplate=\"footer\">\n      <div class=\"tex-al-right\">Sum: {{sumAmountDue}}</div>\n    </template>\n    <template let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n      <div class=\"tex-al-right\">{{data.amount_due | currency:'EUR':true}}</div>\n    </template>\n  </p-column>\nPLease note we are on PrimeNG 2.0.3. But is 4.RC1 compatible with Angular 2?. Will it be ever backported to the current stable version of PrimeNG?. Well I don't know about RC1, we are using Angular 2.4.9, cannot use NG 4 because the other libs are not NG4 ready! \nAnyway it will be nice if you can backport it in the stable branch 'cos it is broken ATM. Having the same problem. Any chance someone from primeng to acknowledge this as bug?. @cagataycivici sorry to ping you like this but this is still happening in RC3 - i will not go 'round make all the grids immutable as this is a workaround and not a real solution.

And then it stops. Or 2) after I scroll slowly over the end of the first page, the second gets loaded, then the first one, then the second one and so on forever.. maybe it would be nice if it was repaired.

I am considering using PrimeNG - it looks very promising, and this is the make-or-break factor for us. It is not just an issue here; it is the most lacking feature of any Angular component package. There is a major lack of keyboard support for sorting and filtering, however many data table components do support some kind of keyboard row selection support..

I'm experiencing centering issues with the confirm dialog as well.. @TheAvalanche This does not work for me when the contents uses bootstrap classes like .row because it is floated. My content still overflows some - meaning it shows a scroll, but it doesn't scroll enough.\nEdit: I believe this is not due to the floated contents, but rather the top positioning set by the call to .center(). As a workaround, I set a [positionTop] and instead of calling the center method, just called the positionOverlay method.. Yes, I'm in need of showHeader right now!. ",

    "Mysame": "I can confirm this issue still exists today, but it only triggers if the tables have [responsive]=\"true\".\nThe following style corrects this behavior:\nth .ui-column-title {\n    display: inline !important;\n}. Definitely to do with the [responsive] attribute, also happens with 4.1.3. Additionally, using the Time component at the bottom of the DatePicker, it is possible to interract with it if the minDate is set higher than today (= the default selected value). So it is possible to select \"today\", even if the mindate is tomorrow, by clicking any of the time controls.. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L853\n```\nvar selectedDate = !_showTime ?\nnew Date(year, month, day) :\nnew Date(year, month, day,  this.currentHour, this.currentMinute, this.currentSecond);\nvalidMin = !this.minDate || this.minDate < selectedDate;\nvalidMax = !this.maxDate || this.maxDate > selectedDate;\n```\nStep it up, Prime!. It would seem weird to leave it there if it's \"not suggested\".\nAnd while it may be valid, it doesn't work if the implementation uses Angular Universal. The reasoning I do not know, but the \"not suggested\" import breaks server side pre-rendering.. This is still very much present in 4.2.0. Sure it \"works\", but the way it looks is really bad. If you have a lazy-load table showing values from 200 -> 0, you'll keep repeating 200 -> 190 until it suddenly manages to load something within the \"timer\" and suddenly shows 140 (for example). Really lazily done.. @cagataycivici \nThe fix is partial.\nThe control hijacks the mouse / keyboard. It's impossible to leave the control after selecting data.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/P4L7eGEIYJNTwiYyDr4j?p=preview\nOpened ticket  at #4395\n. <p-calendar [(ngModel)]=\"value\" showTime=\"true\" hourFormat=\"12\"></p-calendar>. @cagataycivici , this has been removed from the roadmap.\nWhat's going on?. Seems to have been stealth-added.\nThanks.. I can vaguely recall having the same issue. However, you won't get a response because you're still using p-dataTable. Best choice is switching over to p-Table.. Confirmed in my project, pretty big oversight.. This is solved in 5.2.7 , plese upgrade your project to this version.. This just completely broke my whole project, great.\nYou can't just pull functionality like this. An informative line in the console is definitely not enough.\nI see no reason why @Menecats PR wasn't accepted. It fixes the concern of \"double-logic\", and allows us flexibility with timezones.. Honestly, the g-map implementation is pretty lackluster and not on the current roadmap to expand.\nYou're better off writing your own \"wrapper\" around google-map. Or just using google-map.. Doesn't this revert #5772 fixed 20 days ago by @Merve7 ?. Too bad. Sometimes the table lacks (specific) functionality which requires access to these components.. \ud83d\ude44 Thank goodness updateInputfield() is an exposed method.. The documentation makes perfect sense; in order to update [value], the reference needs to be changed.\n```\n// Imagine you have a p-table somewhere with [value]=\"list\"\n// This does NOT update the [value] binding, list reference unchanged\nlist.push({name: \"new item\"}); \n// This updates the list reference, and will trigger a [value] update\nlist = [{name: \"new item\"}].concat(list); \n```\nIt's like this in pretty much all of Angular by default, this is no different.. This is on the roadmap.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/wiki/Roadmap . You're misunderstanding a number of things.\nfield selects a property to show as label\ndataKey is used to differentiate between multiple objects to improve performance in sorting / filterting\nNeither of these fields decide what gets bound.\nIf you're binding to a list of {id: number, label: string}, but you want the id to bind to your customerId control, you have 2 options\na) Slightly refactor your code to follow PrimeNG's SelectItem class\nImport from import { SelectItem } from \"primeng/components/common/selectitem\";\nThen refactor your object to;\n{\n label: /* your customer label */,\n value: /* your customer's id */\n}\nAnd use a list of the above to populate your p-dropdown\nb) use (onChange) to set the properly correctly, using a dummy (for example) customerIdObject field to bind your object to, and then setting customerId in the (onChange). Quoting https://www.primefaces.org/primeng-6-0-0-released/ \nPrimeNG 6.0.0 is fully compatible with Angular 6 and RxJS 6, \nif you are using Angular 5 then you need to continue using PrimeNG 5.x instead.. Confirmed.\nCalendar has been having a LOT of regressions recently. I'm afraid of updating at this point. \n@cagataycivici . Fixed in https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/f71dcd83199133df967ef5c249686bbb2b90a45f\n6388 . @cagataycivici I regret to inform that this is not fixed by https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6760 .\nA distinction should be made between what requires tabindex=\"0\" and tabindex=\"-1\".\n-1 will be ignored by browser.. This because the otherMonth property of the DateMeta is always undefined.\nStil happens in 6.1.2. @cagataycivici , not entirely.\nThe navigators now update properly thanks to a latest fix, HOWEVER try pressing back / forward on the calendar control after clicking \"Today\". You'll be back at previous position (with 1 back or forward), NOT from the position of \"Today\"\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-uggfuf-fuzz2b?file=src/app/app.component.html\n1) Go forward 2 months October\n2) Press \"Today\", you'll be at August, controll will close\n3) Open control, press forward\n4) You'll be at November. Expected result: September\nAgain, this is because otherMonth is undefined when clicking \"Today\". Only if otherMonth is true will the model be set properly.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/components/calendar/calendar.ts#L715-L723\nAs you can see from the code, currentMonth and currentYear do NOT get set if otherMonth is not filled true, which causes this bug.. This very much sounds like a bug. Re-rendering sounds like an XY problem solution to me.\nCould you provide a repo / example of this scenario, so it can be reproduced?\nTo help you out in the meanwhile, you can force Angular to run changeDetection.\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/ChangeDetectorRef#detectChanges. Duplicates #6270. This has nothing to do with PrimeNG.\nYou keep re-creating the options.\nAngular keeps calling getOptions2() every update, which results in you clicking an object that either no longer exists, or has been replaced.\nBind options to a list that only updates when required, not one that gets re-created every Angular update.. You can down-vote all you want, honestly. The code is wrong, it's against how Angular is supposed to work. You'll get undefined behavior, because the scenario itself is, I'm sorry, utter garbage.\nDon't count on this being fixed, fix your own code.. You can find dozens of posts about change detection.\nSimply put, every time anything changes in your app, Angular runs change detection. This will re-validate and re-calculate all bindings. Including your code of [options]=\"getOptions2(). Every time this happens, getOptions2() will return a brand new list. Data might go out of sync, where the GUI is showing old data, but the binding is new. Hence, clicking it doesn't do anything. But clicking triggers change detection again, which will repopulate the dropdown.\nLong story short: don't put functions as bindings.\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/test-p-table-rsjpqd. > with the same code\nYou don't, the code is wrong.\nI'm unsubscribing from this issue, as it is clearly a waste of my time. Can no longer properly reproduce - was an edge case situation which I've refactored..

Sorry - but this is breaking.\nMaybe switch over to lodash ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.isequal ). No reason to invent the wheel twice.\nThe following will infinite loop (I've exported the current method equalsbyValue locally):\n```\nconst x = {} as any;\nx.a = x;\nconst y = {} as any;\ny.a = y;\nthis.equalsByValue(x, y);\n```\nAlso\n```\nconst x = {} as any;\nx.a = [x];\nconst y = {} as any;\ny.a = [y];\nthis.equalsByValue(x, y);\n```. @yigitfindikli , I've been trying to replicate this behavior without success. However, logging indicates that some of our users do experience it; I'm still investigating.\nFact remains that the equalsByValue method is a poor implementation of a deep equals, something that has been solved a long time ago. This will always result in bugs.. It's very easy to get when not using dataKey. However, I'm getting this in my tables that do have dataKey specified, so I'm still investigating.\nEasiest way to trigger: table with objects that self-reference, selectionMode specified, and no datakey: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-s1mx7f\nI'm just trying to emphasize that fixing the above scenario by checking for dataKey is not the way to approach this. It's not only p-table that is having problems, and all of this started happening after the equalsByValue refactor.\nThe equalsByValue's \"refactor\" needs ~refactoring~ fixing. . https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/d2d4a294d05f0860a785b9dd65beb14dac9c2e63\nHere you can see that visited got taken out, which acted as a cache. This was to safeguard against infinite loops.. Most likely side-effect of what's described in #6270. It's a bad import that should be fixed regardless.. [filter]=\"true\" [itemSize]=\"34\" [filter]=\"false\"\nThat seems odd.. You probably should, as of now it isn't clear and looks wrong (even if it functions correctly). ",

PrimeNG 1.1 Release Info\nBreaking Changes\n\nRow expansion template requires a pTemplate whose value is rowexpansion to correctly identify it.. Same here, upgraded to PrimeNg 1.1.1 and Angular 2.4.1, get same error for dataTables \nUPDATE: Reverted back to Angular 2.3.1, PrimeNg left v. 1.1.1, seems to work so far, though I'm not happy each time Angular updates somethings get broken. Isn't this against SEMVER ?. I have the same issue. Possibly fix for ~~breaking~~ unexpected change made in latest Angular 2 update broke this one.  #1652. @NikitaForm Instead of row.id I've used property in my row object that didn't triger template refresh when expected, and it seems to work. Thanks\n\nIf this didn't work I'd use this one: How to programmaticaly trigger refresh primeNG datatable when a button is clicked. Using dataKey seems to fix it, yet from documentation I get it as it's supposed to be used for performence, shouldn't be a requirement.. Second to this, I'm having same issue. With final release (4.0) still having this. In my case I've used this pattern as described in Angular Docs, so growl messages are trigerred from other components by an app level service and app component observes those events, when received a message, adds it to a component defined array (app component), which growl's value property points to. But they are not removed after 5 seconds.. I see same problem, focus not leaving autoComplete, when forceSelection is used with object selection.. In my case, while appendTo=\"body\" works, the moment table gets filtered/refreshed I see dropdown options next to table:\n\nthe moment table gets refreshed:\n\n. ",
    "garthmason": "Yep, I've noticed the same bug - the workaround @brtnshrdr and @DmitryEfimenko suggested works a treat though!\n. Agree this would be very useful - we have a similar scenario, where select a row item from say page 3, and navigate to a child route to edit that item. Then on routing back to the grid page we want to select page 3 again by default.\nCurrently working around this by accessing the DataTable as a ViewChild and calling the paginate function (with first/rows parameters) to select the desired page.\n. We also wanted to do this, and are working around it by getting the datatable as a ViewChild and then forcing the paginator to set the page we want (see below):\n@ViewChild(DataTable) dataTable: DataTable;\n... and \nsetCurrentPage(n: number) {\n    let paging = {\n      first: ((n - 1) * this.dataTable.rows),\n      rows: this.dataTable.rows\n    };\n    this.dataTable.paginate(paging);\n  }. Not sure about that call to reset, I haven't had to do that anywhere.\nIn my case, I get the required page e.g \"2\" from an optional route parameter\nngOnInit() { \nthis.gridPage = (this.route.snapshot.params['page'] || 1); // Get the page we want, if no parameter then default to the first page\n}\nThen after the component is loaded, I set the current page.\nngAfterViewInit() {\n        this.dataTable.setCurrentPage(this.gridPage);\n    }\n. I'm doing client side paging too mate.\nNot sure what else could be the difference .. we are loading our data via a service in ngOnInit(), then setting the page in ngAfterViewInit().  \nThe other thing we do is capture the selected page size e.g 5, 10 or 20, in a user preferences service and apply that to all grids as the default page size by binding to the datatable rows property. That rows value also gets used in our setCurrentPage function.\nAnyways it's working or both of us :thumbsup:. I'm using packages: Angular ~2.1.0 and PrimeNg 1.0.0-rc.7\nWe're not setting the sort field and order ... but I just had a quick try for single sort and it's working for me e.g. for a table that has a DataColumn for field 'LoginId'\n```\nsetCurrentPage(n: number) {\n    let paging = {\n      first: ((n - 1) * this.dataTable.rows),\n      rows: this.dataTable.rows\n    };\n    this.dataTable.paginate(paging);\nthis.dataTable.sortField = \"LoginId\";\nthis.dataTable.sortOrder = -1;\n\n}\n```\nNot sure why you need to set this.dataTable.rows ? The call to paginate will do that.. I'm still seeing this issue in Beta 20.\nI've switched to using a Date object, so don't get an error - but the initial data still won't display. \nCurrently using the ViewChild workaround as described by @sslee \n. Yep .. I think I'm having the same thing on beta20.  \nI've some other issues with timezone that seems to be causing the value to be different in IE vs Chrome .. not sure if that's related yet, need to investigate it\n. Agree, be good if this is fixed. Also note this shows up on the PrimeNG Demo site when you select the bootstrap theme.\n.

You can always combine minDate, maxDate, disabledDates + validator + styling enabled dates.. @sarojmaharjan999 ... ah, you didn't understand it fully ... I meant that you could highlight the dates + control via a custom validator what a user can select, so it wasn't directly like pure enabling.

    "jayeffaar": "That would be pretty useful to us. We need to be able to automatically expand the parent of a newly created sub-folder, or restore a previous selection from user preferences, and auto-expand to it.\n. I see now that it was dropped at the request of a user (https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/284), but that seems like a strange move to not have made that behaviour optional. As far as I can tell, toggling a selection in a table without the use of the ctrl key is very non-standard. Having to individually click on every selected element to turn them off is a pain, instead of being able to simply click on one to reset the multiple selection.\n. I wasn't thinking about mobile, and I can see now why you would need a simple click-based selection mode in that case.\nIn our case though, we really need the selection to behave like a desktop app, and we have an outstanding story to bypass the datatable's selection logic and handle the Shift and Ctrl/Meta keys ourselves in onRowClick events. We haven't gotten to it yet, and obviously, it would be nicer if the datatable offered that functionality as an option. It already has so many (useful) options that one more wouldn't make it more confusing.\nCan you see that as something that could be added soon-ish, or should we go ahead with our plans to write our own selection logic? (Something we expect to get to around mid to late September)\n. Hi. Any update on when we can expect this fix now? We can't release without a scrollable table, but we also need adjustable column widths.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I've been fighting what seems like a similar problem for a few days now. We have a column toggler and resizable columns (no fixed columns). Hiding columns works fine, but adding them back in messes up the table width, making it go wider and adding a horizontal scroll bar to our page.\nI've tried everything I could think off to force the columns to keep a proper width, totaling less than than the desired table width, but nothing seems to make a difference. Even setting all columns widths to just a few pixels, the table still expands horizontally when toggling a column back on.\nWith resizable columns set to false, all columns behave when being added back.\nThis is a little different than the original post, but since the two issues have toggled resizable columns in common, I suspect a common root cause..

    "mischkl": "I have another use case which would work better with a template-driven approach: being able to  add things like custom styling, custom attributes (directives), custom filters, or custom content to individual menu items. With the current approach none of this is possible. (OK, filters are possible but not as convenient.) One great example is the ability to highlight a menu item according to whether a certain route is selected. Normally you would just use the routerLinkActive attribute directive to add a class when the linked route is active, but with the current system it's not possible.\nIn answer to the question from @cagataycivici: I guess command binding is simply a matter of adding a (click) handler to the menu item? Or does the command binding do something more than simply binding a callback to a click?\nI'd also like to propose that maybe the ability to use the MenuModel could be offered as an alternative to using pure templating. I do believe there are some use cases where it is a benefit to be able to dynamically generate the menu structure in code, and other cases where it would be nicer to simply use templating.\n. Ah, sorry I think that was caused by the autoformatting in IntelliJ that strips the whitespace.... I reverted everything but the essentials, should be good to go.. Any news on this? Actually I am thinking it would make sense for a bunch of other menu components. This is actually a feature that is very much needed for our application, so it would be great it it could be added shortly.\nSome background info: I tried adding the same functionality without modifying the components but found it pretty much impossible, since there is no simple way of getting at the menu item elements and adding classes conditionally from outside of the component.\nI did notice that this is something that seems to be working in the Ultima theme Live Preview, which was one of the reasons why we opted for using PrimeNG in the first place. @cagataycivici could you speak to whether there is any way of getting this working, outside of submitting pull requests for every MenuItem-based component?. @vadimzham I think this might be a case where you need to set encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None in your component decorator. Try that and see if it works for your use case. It admittedly prevents you from  encapsulating any other styles in your component, but you can work around that by either adding your component's element to the beginning of all your selectors, create an extra wrapper component for this purpose, or you could add the custom styling to a global stylesheet.\nNote that this is an \"issue\" with all Angular components, not just PrimeNG, since by default they all have Shadow DOM emulation (ViewEncapsulation.Emulated) turned on..

So the feature is essential.\nAs for checkbox selection it is should be implemented like in \"primefaces\". Checkbox selection is very crucial, for example if you check the parent node, all child nodes should be checked relatively. Look at the primefaces demo of TreeTable. \n. Ok. I have created new issues for each point separately.\n. Thank you! Looking forward for new features in Tree component!!. A little bit, it displays dash instead of cross sign and mostly used in partial selection like in Tree.\nhttps://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/\n. I think this issue is crucial and still waiting for your response.... Nope, not window scroll. Well, Tree and TreeTable itself contains scroll. So this scroll should position on the selected node. It depends if selected node is in the middle of tree, scroll should move down or up to the position of node. So, wherever selected node, scroll should move to it's position.. Yeah, that would be great!. You are completely wrong. rowspan works with td tag.. Again, You are completely wrong. I need to deal with rows not columns. Rows are quite different.. See attached file. Exactly, i want to reproduce such table using prime ng DataTable. Otherwise, i have to use html tables.\nThe point is some columns and rows grouped. In fact, i want to group rows.. Again, You are completely wrong. You can make only first column row grouping. I need to group rows on custom. . Instead of showing me docs, first, try to reproduce the problem. . I want to groups rows. In fact, i can group columns in DataTable but not rows. I know there are expandable rows feature, but i want to group some rows, others remain as it is. See attached file. To be specific i want to manipulate with rowspan attribute td tag of body of the DataTable.. I think it is a great feature to customize rows. See picture. It has rows grouped. Currently, you can not do this in DataTable.\n. I used plain html table. So i could handle rowspan and colspan manually. Unfortunately, primeng does not have such feature yet.. When you could add such feature?. Ok, looking forward to this feature.. For instance, Toolbar can be a group of buttons. So if i block toolbar, all buttons, items of toolbar will be unavailable. I think it is reasonable, because i do not need to block each item itself.. It is not clear whether there are records or not. So i think it is better to display that there no records.. I think a very good feature should also be rowspan and colspan for rows. Currently available only for headers. Is it in a plan?. It should be considered that rows can have columns with multiple number of rowspan and cospan attributes.. I guess currently you support rowgouping by only one column, but it is not enough. It should support any number of rowspan and colspan. ",

Any news on this? Ran into this issue cause I created a workaround for filtering and sorting piped data...  . Any progress on this?. I think the problem is that touch devices do not support the native drag and drop implementation. Did a bit myself with manually copying the element on touch start but getting the element where you drop is difficult since you have to get it by calculating using the current position of the touch event and getting the element on that coordinate. Then you have to check if that element is wrapped by a parent element containing the droppable directive. \nIt is possible but hard to do.. One could iterate over the DOM tree and use QuerySelector to get the correct elements?. Just a quick example, the columns-Array defines the columns which you want to export (tested in Edge, FF and Chrome)\nexportToCSV(datatable: DataTable, columns: number[], name: string): void {\n        let headerString = '';\n        const headers = datatable.el.nativeElement.querySelectorAll('.ui-column-title');\n        for (const column of columns) {\n            headerString += headers[column - 1].innerText + ';';\n        }\n        const tableRows = datatable.el.nativeElement.querySelectorAll('TR');\n        const rowsString: string[] = [];\n        for (let i = 1; i < tableRows.length; i++) {\n            let rowString = '';\n            const tableRow = tableRows[i].querySelectorAll('.ui-cell-data');\n            for (const column of columns) {\n                rowString +=  tableRow[column - 1].innerText.replace(/[\\n\\r]+/g, '').replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim() + ';';\n            }\n            rowsString.push(rowString);\n        }\n        let csv = headerString + '\\n';\n        for (const row of rowsString) {\n            csv += row + '\\n';\n        }\n        const blob = new Blob(['\\uFEFF', csv], {type: 'text/csv'});\n        const link = document.createElement('a');\n        link.setAttribute('href', window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));\n        link.setAttribute('download', name + '.csv');\n        document.body.appendChild(link); // Required for FF\n        link.click();\n    }\nUse it like this: \n```\n\n\nExport CSV\n \n...\n\n```. Any news on this?. > Even allowing defs to be defined can solve some of this issue. Pre-defined defs \"9, a, *\" are limiting. Especially if you want to use it with slotChar.

All inputs should be rewritten as a directive imo... that way one could combine inputMask with other directives.. Imo the approach primeng took is not the best but it works in all browsers.

Wouldnt it be better to start using the DatePipe from Angular? Had to modify the current calendar to be able to use millis as input and use the DatePipe for better and easier formatting. Also has predefined names and shorts for days and month so one does not have to manually translate them. Only thing required is the locale. Also seems to be the case for the checkbox and radio options (might be intended but previously the behaviour was different)\n\n. OK this is a problem with Angular *ngFor. ",

I'll try again disabling my IDE auto-format. @cagataycivici can you please review?\nIt is possible to have this fix included in the next release?. The #5823 simplifies the code, you don't have to code twice because it access automatically to the UTC and non-UTC methods by using  the utc flag.\nEg:\n```javascript\ndoSomething(): void {\n    // Before\n    const pm = this.utc ? this.date.getUTCHours() > 11 : this.date.getHours() > 11;\n    // After\n    const pm = this.getHours(this.date) > 11;\n// Before\nthis.utc ? this.date.setUTCHours(13) : this.date.setHours(13);\n// After\nthis.setHours(this.date, 13);\n\n}\ngetHours(date: Date): number {\n    if (this.utc) {\n        return date.getUTCHours();\n    }\n    return date.getHours();\n}\nsetHours(date: Date, hours: number): Date {\n    if (this.utc) {\n        date.setUTCHours(hours);\n    }\n    date.setHours(hours);\nreturn date\n\n}\n```. @digaus I've tried to keep as much as possible the same behaviour as the original calendar component.\nThe datePipe is useful for formatting dates but not to parse them (AFAIK), I've used DateTime from Luxon because it's good for timezone management and for the ease of formatting capabilities (it uses browser native Intl API).\nRegarding the locale, in some projects I've worked on it was useful to have the possibility to change every single i18n entry of the calendar, but that depends on each use case..

I'm not sure if you all notice, but the growl is always sticky, even on your demo page they don't close anymore automatically.\nit has to do with your refactoring to setter last week \nthe setter is not updating / being called when you push a message to the array , therefore it doesn't handle the valuechange that contains the sticky \nset value(val:Message[]) {\n        this._value = val;\n        if(this.container) {\n            this.handleValueChange();\n        }\n    }.

The implementation is not correct in my opinion\n(as mentioned above ) whenever forceselection is set to true and you have made a selection \nTHEN whenever you want to click on a control like another button , the first thing that happens is that the onInputBlur is being called which in turns calls the onselect (again..)\nthis makes this implementation useless in any form with just an autocomplete and a submit button, (users might think the submit button is not working) \nI've sold this issue for the moment by resetting the suggestions to undefined so that this line is evaluated false. Hope this might help for other people\nps my suggestions are from a http call, others might have predefined suggestions, so for them a different solution might be found\nif(this.forceSelection && this.suggestions) {\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/components/autocomplete/autocomplete.ts#L512\n. you changed that in your commit https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/a5636678c03a40f2a4f9e2ceaf2a9fd1b8d30b8f#diff-a8c8d16b87c6a1c9d311deb4a0f2e550 i think for disabled etc.. this is fine, but not for readonly. It's not a big issue anymore as i have changed false into null, but it's still incorrect as in your documentation https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/spinner\nreadonly | boolean | false | When present, it specifies that the element should be read-only.\nbut it's better to change this into null\n. all it would take is to change only your package json back to @angular ^4.4.6 , no other changes would be required as JIT works just fine. took the hard pain and i'm now on angular 5 jit and aot. the fact is that no decimals can be entered whether we use a . or a , \nif you go to your homepage spinner  https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/spinner\nand take the second example (that has a step of 0.5)  and try to enter whatever decimal it doesn't work.  So entering decimals should be allowed . I leave it open if this should be related to a step number or not. well it's right here \n\n. ok, true, it's no longer there the onLabel in 6.0.2  , must have been my component then not being adapted to these breaking changes.\nI'll close it , maybe others if they still have a problem can reopen it. you can always add !important or combine it with another css element . any update on this ?  commit looks good to me. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6174. the variable isvisible is already set to false before onOverlayHide is being called, so this never get's executed. There's indeed a conflict with disabled when we're using reactive forms \nsee also https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/6527. But you can solve it by removing the [disabled] and handle it though the reactive form\nthis.form.controls['nameofcontrol'].disable();. have you installed @angular/cdk ? i simply npm install @angular/cdk and it worked. Well it has been added to prime ?\nimport { ScrollingModule } from '@angular/cdk/scrolling';\nand it's in prime's package json as a dev dependency. ",

Stupid mistake. Forgot to delete the node_modules folder and re-install everything after removing refelct-metadata from my package.json.\nOnce I did that the install went through fine. Interestingly, though, it ended up installing the same version of reflect-metadata that the package.json wanted it to.\nAnyways, thanks for helping out with this.\nCheers\nKunal\n. @garethlewis - I don't see any errors in the console. I'm attaching a screen shot of how the map shows up.\n\n. @garethlewis I do have a valid key\n. That didn't load the map tile. I've tried 2 different approaches\n1. Use the example that is there on http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/gmap with hard coded values for options & overlays set in ngOnInit(). In that case I still see a grey map tile but i so see the Google logo on the bottom left of the map tile\n2. My current approach (code pasted above) - in that case the options & overlay are populated a little later as I'm looking for the current position using the navigator.geolocation which requires a callBack function. In this case i don't even see the Google logo. One more thing I just noticed was that if I try and drag any portion of the map, i see multiple errors on the console. Sample pasted there\n\n. @garethlewis The index.html has the link to google maps api. I actually just got it working. I think the issue was that while I was initializing the overlays array to a blank array the Options property was null. As soon as I initialized the options property to {center: {lat: 0.00, lng: 0.00}, zoom: 4};the map showed up properly. \nThe only problem I have now is that the map remains centered at 0,0. I does not recenter itself to my location after the navigator.geolocation callBack function comes back. Any idea on how to do that?\n. @garethlewis - thx for pointing out the key thing and helping out with this. REALLY appreciate the super quick response on this :-)\n. @garethlewis Thanks. That fixed it. Though I had to call that at a different place. Maybe a lack of understanding on when to call these events/ methods on my end. In my case the map is shown on a modal popup and just calling this or calling the setCenter() wasn't working for me. What worked was to call this and the centering/ panning code inside the handler for AfterViewChecked inside a setTimout function. Here's the snippet of the code that finally worked for me\n```\n    ngAfterViewChecked(): void {\n        if(this.currentLocation && !this.isPannningDone) {\n            setTimeout(() => {\n                console.log('Inside ngAfterViewChecked');\n                this.isPannningDone = true;\n                this.gmap.map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng(this.currentLocation.lat, this.currentLocation.lng));\n                this.gmap.map.panTo(new google.maps.LatLng(this.currentLocation.lat, this.currentLocation.lng));\n                google.maps.event.trigger(this.gmap.map, \"resize\");\n            }, 1000);\n        } // End of if(this.currentLocation && !this.isPannningDone)\n    } // End of ngAfterViewChecked\n```\nThanks though. :-)\n. I have a application where the user is searching for a doctor and all known addresses for the doctor need to be shown. since I already have a form on the base page I've designed the search & the results to show up on a modal popup. With the code fix I pasted above its now working for me.\n. Hi Kris. Thanks for the link to the other issue. But my issue was different than that one and I posted the code that worked for me. \n. ",

Thank you for answer! Actually, I used exactly this as a workaround :)\nBut that means that I have to create a selector for every icon that I use, does it not?. I can confirm this behavior on 4.1.0.

I'd have no problem with it being the default behavior as long as an option to activate the prior behavior is given :) I think it is quite a default behavior in lists/tables/trees/... everywhere: Normal clicking selects one item, clicking with ctrl allows for multiple selections and shift key allows for range selection..

At the same time the application should allow to edit certain fields.\nI would like to ask for your reasons to close this as an unsupported usecase, when the workaround described in https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1011 works and looks reasonably well:\n\nFor us this workaround would be sufficient for our usecase to have editable=true and selectionMode=single at the same time.\nPlease reconsider your decision, if you have some time. Other than that, keep up the great work. :-). Same here.\nAre there generally restrictions in the data table with nested objects? Or are nested object values fully supported.. Same issue here. Issue occurs during unselect, also on single items.. Is this on the agenda somehow, as the restriction to mouse input renders the time selection variant of p-calendar practically useless. Users would need to click 30 times (or keep the button pressed for quite a while) to get from 15:00 to 15:30.. Correction: component is not entirely useless as mentioned previously, as it is possible to enter the time directly into the linked input field. Nevertheless it is a bit more cumbersome for the user, as the user needs to pay attention to the format in the input field (e.g: separation characters)\n. ",

There has been a lot of posts in this thread. If anyone in the PrimeNg team has had a look at this, can you please give some information about if it's up to us to programmatically set this.msgArray = [] in a setTimeout() or is there a fix for the \"life\" attribute coming up?\nThanks in advance! // Happy user.

So, could it be possible to use the dataKey property to also check expanded rows in the future for datatables (I think it now only checks for selected rows)? . http://plnkr.co/edit/K6rpRi?p=preview\nRight, did forget: The error occurs when you click on a date in the calendar.. Okay, so maybe the error is dependent on the version of Firefox? For me, I get the error in our system, on your demo page (https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/calendar) and on the plunkr. One of our users called our support line with the same issue (didn't ask for firefox version), reverting back to older version fixed this.. No! Everything was working fine. Installed 4.1.0-RC3 wich was uploaded on our server wich apparently broke the calendar for users on firefox! I don't know what version of primeng that is installed on https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/ but the error is thrown there also for me.\nAnyway, reverting back to primeng 4.0.2 fixed this issue for us (I have another problem on 4.1.0-rc1). I don't know if there is some other information I can give that could possibly help, more than the provided firefox version of mine in the first post. But if so, please give me a shout! :).

Consider explicitly re-exporting to resolve the ambiguity.\n[ts] Module './components/datatable/datatable' has already exported a member named 'TableBody'.

Okay, took another approach.\nAdding the file table.d.ts in node_modules/primeng with the code\nexport * from './components/table/table';\nmade it work.

Similar issue here.\nAs a workaround I set the activeTab programmatically in routed component's OnInit method.\nBut this leads to other problems - for example when working with canDeactivate in routing, where the user clicks another tab, but (after a warning) decides to stay on current page to save changes or whatever.\nIn this case the <li> element of the one tab and the <a> element of the other tab, both have class ui-state-active added.\nI'm sorry, cannot provide a plunkr atm, because of restrictions.\nI hope you'll review anyway, thanks for your great work.. @arjunshankar in my case it was sufficient to style the active item based on the <a> elements ui-state-active class only (while ignoring <li> element completely).

I just started using primeng yesterday (actually only for the calendar!) and I'm finding this issue - minDate bindings aren't working and I'm not invested enough to play around with OnInit hacks to get it working.... @aderbas Hey - I'm fairly new to Angular2 and was running across the same problem. While carefully looking at the articles that @cagataycivici shared I noticed that neither of them explicitly added the primeng javascript file into angular.cli.json:\n\"styles\": [\n      \"styles.css\",\n      \"../node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css\",\n      \"../node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/omega/theme.css\"\n   ],\n   \"scripts\": [\n   \"../node_modules/primeng/primeng.js\" // <<DON'T ADD THIS LINE IT'S NOT NEEDED FOR PRIMENG\n ],\nEven though when using the Angular CLI it's common to add both the CSS & JS files into angular.cli.json, in the case of PrimeNG it's not necessary to add the JavaScript file, and if you do add it, it will cause the error you came across. \nI hope that helps!!\nCheers, \nJake.

But if I try to set the page in ngOnInit() programmatically, it just stays on the first page.\nThe background of my problem is that the table always starts with page 1, even if I am on e.g. page 3, I click on a row which takes me to a different view/component to see the row data details and if I navigate back to the list the page is lost and I am at the start again ... :(\nHere is my code:\n```\n// template\n    <p-dataTable #dt ...\n// component\n@ViewChild('dt') dataTable: DataTable;\nngOnInit() {\n    this.getData();\n}\n\ngetData() {\n    this.difflogService.getLogsUrl().then(\n        difflogs => {\n            this.difflogs = difflogs;\n            // test - set the table to a fix paging value to\n            // see if it works ...\n            this.setCurrentPage(2);\n        },\n        error =>  {this.addAlert(<any>error, \"danger\");}\n    );\n}\nonPage(event) {\n    console.log(\"paging occured ...\");\n    console.log(event);\n}\nsetCurrentPage(n: number) {\n    let paging = {\n        first: ((n - 1) * this.dataTable.rows),\n        rows: this.dataTable.rows\n    };\n    this.dataTable.paginate(paging);\n}\n\n```\nAnd I see that the event is triggered and that the first element should be 10 ... but it still is 0. Hm, weird, the above code works if I call \"this.datatable.reset()\" first:\nsetCurrentPage(n: number) {\n        // only works if reset is called first...?\n        this.dataTable.reset();\n        let paging = {\n            first: ((n - 1) * this.dataTable.rows),\n            rows: this.dataTable.rows\n        };\n        this.dataTable.paginate(paging);\n    }\n. I've tried to set it in the ngAfterViewInit() callback, too, but that didn't help either...\nMy guess now is that maybe you are using server side pagination whereas I am using client side pagination? I am setting/getting the current page via a service, that part works well btw.. Hm, true, the paging is working, but the sorting isn't ... :( If I get back on the datatable view, the page is set now, but the sorting info is lost... I am setting the sort field and order via a custom object (the values are ok), but that doesn't work... any idea? Can you post your sorting and rows part, too? What version are you using? I have even updated all my package.json libs (Angular 2.3.0, primeng 1.0.0, ...), didn't help either ...\n```\n    /*\n     * Set datatable page from outside\n     * @param n\n     /\n    setCurrentPage(n: number) {\n        // only works if reset is called first...?\n        this.dataTable.reset();\n    let meta = this.difflogService.getCurrentDatatableMeta();\n\n    if (typeof meta !== \"undefined\" && meta.currentRows > 0) {\n        console.log(\"setting sorting and rows ...\");\n        console.log(meta);\n        this.dataTable.sortField = meta.sortField;\n        this.dataTable.sortOrder = meta.sortOrder;\n        this.dataTable.multiSortMeta = meta.multiSortMeta;\n        this.dataTable.rows = meta.currentRows;\n        //this.dataTable['first'] = meta.currentPage;\n    }\n\n    let paging = {\n        first: ((n - 1) * this.dataTable.rows),\n        rows: this.dataTable.rows\n    };\n    this.dataTable.paginate(paging);\n}\n\n```. It turned out that I had to call reset() because we were setting the initial sorting in the template ... and I think it may be by design that if you set some sorting, the datatable is going back to page 1, so it might not even be a bug :)\nAnyways, I ended up using a little timeout to go to the correct page after sorting the data.\nSo here is my final setCurrentPage() method:\n```\n    setCurrentPage() {\n        let n = 1;\n        let meta = this.difflogService.getCurrentDatatableMeta();\n        if (typeof meta !== \"undefined\") {\n            n = meta.currentPage;\n        if (typeof meta.sortField !== \"undefined\") {\n            this.dataTable.sortField = meta.sortField;\n            this.dataTable.sortOrder = meta.sortOrder;\n        }\n        this.dataTable.rows = meta.currentRows;\n    }\n\n    if (n > 1) {\n        let paging = {\n            first: ((n - 1) * this.dataTable.rows),\n            rows: this.dataTable.rows\n        };\n        // the problem is that if we set sorting, the table is\n        // always going back to page 1, so we set a timer to go\n        // back to the current page ...\n        let timer = Observable.timer(100);\n        timer.subscribe(t=> {\n            this.dataTable.paginate(paging)\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThanks for the help, all :).

    "mfelarca": "I wanted to leave a quick thank you here to @garthmason. Your setCurrentPage code works served as a great basis for the work-around I ended up implementing in our project.\nI will also say, for @smxsm's benefit, that I do have single column sorting preserved and working. The only differences I can see between the code you both have above is that I am setting the field and order on the datatable immediately before calling paginate. I also am not calling dataTable.reset().\nHope that helps, and thanks again for the great comments and help.. Hello @smxsm and @darioribas . I think I noticed the multiple calls to load the data as you did. On my project, since it was utilizing lazy loading, it would call to load data from within the ngOnInit, which I was specifying, and then it would call it again on the sort due to having an initial column set for sorting. In order to bypass that, and have the original load invoked, which was pulling the values for the last used sort field and sort order, I simply ensure that during initialization, that load call performs a no-op, and only after that will it handle it's calls. This is done with a simple initialization flag. I don't need to call reset in this case.\nI would guess that is probably why you are seeing your timer work. You are waiting long enough until after that load that is triggered by the initial table sort fires, and then you fire the paginate call. It would be interesting to find out if that is the case, however. Glad you found a solution that works, and let me know if you are seeing the same behavior that I was seeing.\nThanks!. Ugh...of course, my posting that has since resulted in what was working, failing.\n@smxsm you are definitely correct in that there is some kind of timing element involved. I merged in some other changes, and realized that there had been a small delay already in the flow that I was investigating. When I removed that,  it threw things off and I had to incorporate some timing in order to make it work correctly again. Interestingly enough, I don't have to call reset(), I don't delay the pagination call either. Neither of those items worked. What I had to do was in my loadData function, the initial two calls, the first by the table itself initializing, and the second as a result of the pagination call, I've delayed by 100ms each. \nI don't believe this is really robust, and I fear that other changes may break it again, but I hope this will be stable enough until a better solution is put in place.\nI would also like to note that during the pagination, it doesn't seem to correctly update the rowIndex values. I had a column that was computing it's display based of the rowIndex, and it definitely computes it from the initial load, with the initial sort column and initial data rows. \nWhen the pagination occurs, it then correctly sorts them, but if any of those rows had already been computed in terms of their data with respect to the initial rowIndex, it will retain that value. Only rows that were not loaded by the initial load, and thus have not had their value computed yet, will correctly display based off the newly sorted rowIndex values.\nHas anyone else seen this or noticed this? Or is this simply another oddity that may be timing related?\nThanks all in advance.. ",

Then when a user adjusts the width the callback can save the state.  \nAfter some intense investigation this can be done via the following css:\n```\n.ui-datatable table{\n    width:auto;\n}\n.ui-datatable-data>tr>td{\n    max-width: 1px;\n}\n``width:auto` on the table ensure that it is only wide enough to fit the columns. \nmax-width: 1px; on the table elements is to make sure that you can resize a table column without forcing a weird ass scrollbar to appear when you try to make it less than the td content.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nAgain this solution using the following column template setup:\n<p-column *ngFor=\"let col of columns; let i = index\" [header]=\"col\" [style]=\"{width:'101px'}\">\n. The reason why this is happening is because here the top and left is using the event's pageX and pageY. This is positioning it relative to the whole page. This happens because the container's class is .ui-menu.ui-menu-dynamic and if you look here you will see this is absolutely positioned. This means that when you set the top and left that it will absolutely position the context menu container relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. Now it is not a standard reproduction because in all basic examples using primeng you would have to change the positioning of an ancestor to reproduce this. \nWhat are the symptoms of this? \nYou will notice that the context menu is not where you clicked. This because it's being offset to the ancestor rather than the page as expected. Depending on your layout, you may not even see the context menu because it is off the page entirely. \nThis is also why appending it to body works because it positions it to the page. I am not sure it is a bug, however this will also happen with the p-tooltip. \nAn alternative would be to make the {position : 'fixed'} with inline styling. That is also a good test to see if this is the actual problem. . Yeah, I have the problem too...\n\nIt just really sucks when you can use the library so easily and then you run into something like this without a way to fix it. \nUPDATE: \nI found a few things to use. \nangular\n<input pInputText id=\"start\" type=\"datetime-local\"\n               [ngModel]=\"file.Start | date:'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'\"\n               (ngModelChange)=\"file.Start = getDate($event)\" />\nthe getDate is just a ts method created to return Date. It produces the following:\n\nThen I also discovered that if you use the appendTo=\"body\" you get this:\n\nHopefully this helps others that arrive here.\n. FYI workaround for me was to use internal ng class in css\n.ng-valid{\n    width: 100%;\n}\nThis fixes the problem and allows it to stretch. \n\n. This also happens when you place a datatable inside of a p-dialog :(. I agree with this. Sort of weird that by default the tooltip of the menus for example in the p-menubar do not have the same tooltip label as when p-tooltip is used. . ",

Adding appendTo=\"body\" to the p-menu element did work for me.. The property is expandedRowsGroups not expandedRowGroups as stated in the documentation (note the \"s\" in \"Rows\"). You can bind this to an array in your component class.\nFor example:\n<p-datatable ... [expandedRowsGroups]=\"groupHeaders\">\nIn component class:\ngroupHeaders = ['group1','group2','group3'];\n.

    "svideau": "same here, beta 20 is ok and adding \"@types/core-js\": \"^0.9.34\" do not solve the issue with RC1.\n. This modification seems to break #867 by opening the xhr after the onBeforeUpload(), preventing to add headers.. This problem seems to come from the immutable data management in the datatable. I managed to make the custom sorting work by using : \n        let old = this.dataSet;\n        old.sort(sorting);\n        this.dataSet = [...old];\nto set the values in the dataTable, but even if the table is sorted, items with the same value will constantly change places whenever the mouse is moving.\n. I created this plunker to underline the new problems : \nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/J4Kov6lxZsoVsEWTkv98\n-custom sort is called each time the mouse is moving, changing the order of row with the same values (on Chrome 58.0, seems to work fine on edge and firefox...)\n-paginator breaks when sorting using custom sort (on all browsers). For the custom sorting  not updating the UI, the problem comes from the management of the backing array :\nThe following has been added to the primeng websites : \n\nManaging Data\nDataTable uses setter based checking to realize if the underlying data has changed to update the UI so your data changes such as adding or removing a record should always create a new array reference instead of manipulating an existing array. For example, use slice instead of splice when removing an item or use spread operator instead of push method when adding an item. \n\nTo deal with this, you have to use a syntax like this.dataSet = [...this.dataSet.sort(sorting)]; which create a new array, sorted as you want, and put it in the correct variable.\nHowever, even if the display is correct, some features like the paginator still seems to be broken (can't paginate on an array sorted by a custom sorting method).\n . update : adding \" sortMode=\"multiple\"\" in the datatable declaration seems to fix the paginator behavior with custom sorting.\nNo idea why.. @1uc4 I have the same problem with the table headers. as soon as the  [sortMode]=\"multiple\" is set, the visual hints seem broken, even without custom sorting.. With the last release, using [sortMode]=multiple correctly call the custom sort function (2sd table in this example)\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/JAwbb7R9mm9ACCoMQfCL\nThe row breaking phenomenon is visible on chrome in the first table, ands comes from a spam of the calling of the sorting function triggered when the mouse is moving. The 2sd function print a \"sorting 2\" in the js console (F12) when called and i have the correct print when I sort the table.\n(my bad, i forgot to froze the plnkr, now the ocrrect behavior is visible). Here is a plunkr which shows the broken pagination and the broken indicator for custom sorting http://plnkr.co/edit/6EYIDSqGd8OAzOrREJXX. ",
    "apiweb": "Same mistake here.\nIt is always showing the blue background, even if the message is of success or error.\n. It does not work because the primeng components do not have ID tag support. So I can not relate a label using \"label for =[id]\" because the component has no id.... I think this is very interesting.\nBecause Angular, already built in methods to work with dates formats, month/week names, etc....\nExample:\ngetLocaleFirstDayOfWeek()\ngetLocaleMonthNames()\ngetLocaleDateFormat()\nAnd much more, in https://angular.io/api/common\nUsing this and another methods prevents developers from maintaining multiple variables only with the names of the months and weeks..

    "mmikeyy": "Totally agree. I have mentioned the problem before and there seems to be no interest. Perhaps they  don't see the point of a tooltip without text. When you have no tooltip to display, then just don't use the control is probably what they think.\nBut... the use case is very obvious. In a list, I highlight some values that have some characteristic. When the user sees a highlighted value, a tooltip explains the highlight. Most values have a tooltip with no text. However the tooltip keeps rendering with an awkward looking shape when it's empty.\nIt's easy to fix. Each time I upgrade Primeng to a new version, I visit the javascript for the component and make the two following changes:\n`\nTooltip.prototype.show=function(){\nif(!this.text){ //added (if no text, then don't create tooltip container)\n    return;        //added\n  }                   //added\n  this.create();\nTooltip.prototype.hide=function(){\n    if(!this.container){ // added (if container was not create, don't attempt to destroy it)\n      return;   //added\n    } //added\n    this.container.style.display='none';\n    document.body.removeChild(this.container);\n    this.container=null;\n  };\n`\n. Hi,\nThanks for merging the floats.\nBut the other change you're rejecting leaves a problem unsolved.\nIf you leave things as they are, the resizing logic for the height is as\nfollows:\n1) get content height;\n2) add deltaY\n3) adjust height.\nNote that in 3, we adjust 'height', and in 1 we obtained 'content height'.\nThey are the same only if box-sizing is content-box.\nIf box-sizing happens to be set to 'border-box', this logic makes no sense.\nYou're reading a parameter (content height), correcting for deltaY, and\nwriting the result to another parameter (outer height).\nI'm not insisting because I'm some crazy lunatic! I just happened to use a\nlibrary with a css rule that set box-sizing to border-box and found that\nthe primeng dialogs could no longer be resized.\nThe library (primeng) should not go haywire just because the rule\n\"box-sizing: border-box\" happens to be present in another library or in the\nuser's CSS...\nAnother way to circumvent this problem is to set the style \"box-sizing:\ncontent-box!important\" on div.dialog-content in the dialog template. With\n!important otherwise it could be overridden by an 'important' CSS rule. But\nI found this less elegant.\nLe lun. 21 nov. 2016 \u00e0 11:20, \u00c7a\u011fatay \u00c7ivici notifications@github.com a\n\u00e9crit :\n\nMerged floats, getHeight stays as it is, there is already getOuterHeight\nto calculate total height, getHeight is the inner height without padding.\nOf course they are same in border-box.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/1373#issuecomment-261986241,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AB4TULIyZes55kUzcxsSo0HK1pUs7ZNqks5rAcThgaJpZM4K3qXb\n.\n. Extremely annoying issue indeed. Spent the afternoon trying to figure out where this new property was unexpectedly added to objects. I should have checked this thread earlier...\n\nFortunately, it's easy to fix as far as I can tell. The error in their code is that in the domhandler#equals method, they set this temporary property and later delete it. However, they forgot that the method has more than one exit points and not all of them take care of deleting this property, so the temporary property is deleted or not depending on where the method exits returning its result.\nWhat I've done is \n1- put the datatable source code from git in my project directory in folder primeng/datatable.\n2- put the dom/domhandler source code from git in my project directory in folder primeng/dom\n3- modify the imports at top of datatable to refer to primeng in my node_modules (replacing all .. with primeng/components), except for dom/domhandler, which must refer to the new one that was imported (fixed below).\n4- fix the domhandler#equals method as shown below. See comments where I made changes\n5- in your module, import the fixed datatable module instead of the primeng one.\n```typescript\n    public equals(obj1: any, obj2: any): boolean {\n        if (obj1 == null && obj2 == null) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        if (obj1 == null || obj2 == null) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    if (obj1 == obj2) {\n        delete obj1._$visited; //****** this was here but I don't think it's needed as the property hasn't been added yet\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    if (typeof obj1 == 'object' && typeof obj2 == 'object') {\n        obj1._$visited = true;\n        for (var p in obj1) {\n            if (p === \"_$visited\") continue;\n            if (obj1.hasOwnProperty(p) !== obj2.hasOwnProperty(p)) {\n              delete obj1._$visited; // ******** added\n                return false;\n            }\n\n            switch (typeof (obj1[p])) {\n                case 'object':\n                    if (obj1[p] && obj1[p]._$visited || !this.equals(obj1[p], obj2[p])) {\n                      delete obj1._$visited; //**** added\n                      return false;\n                    }\n                    break;\n\n                case 'function':\n                    if (typeof (obj2[p]) == 'undefined' || (p != 'compare' && obj1[p].toString() != obj2[p].toString())) {\n                      delete obj1._$visited; //***** added\n                      return false;\n                    }\n                    break;\n\n\n                default:\n                    if (obj1[p] != obj2[p]) {\n                      delete obj1._$visited; //********* added\n                      return false;\n                    }\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        for (var p in obj2) {\n            if (typeof (obj1[p]) == 'undefined') {\n              delete obj1._$visited; //******* added\n              return false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        delete obj1._$visited; //***** they got this one right!\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n\n```\nThat's it. The temporary property has now disappeared from my datatable components.. Note that the domhandler#equals corrected above has been moved to ObjectUtils#equalsByValue.\nThis method is conditionally called by ObjectUtils#equals depending on the number of parameters it receives.\nThe ObjectUtils#equalsByValue method is the only one in all primeng code that sets a _$visited property, so I'm confident that the fix above (not yet included in primeng) solves the issue. Circumventing the symptom by other means just leaves a ticking time bomb in the code, IMHO.. This is not fixed in 4.1 rc3.\nSee plunkr here: http://plnkr.co/edit/6YjZrJMht7ooIi2tUkaW?p=preview\nThis is a major annoyance.. ",

Unless some kind of escape character was added, the field name just has to be normalized, or you have to render the data manually:\n<p-column header=\"Question 1\">\n    <ng-template let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n        {{data['1. question']}\n    </ng-template>\n</p-column>. This can be done with the new `<p-table/>` if you don't mind switching to it. I modified the plunkr to show how it can be done:\n\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/WO4ICRHSIomIFKqwWoTy?p=preview. No problem. Yes, turbo table has the same features as the datatable. If you need to do any sorting, because your column names have the dots, you'll have to use a custom sort function. You can find out more in the docs. . If you check the docs, you'd find find programmatic control with the activeIndex property.\nHTML:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n        Content 1\n    \n\n        Content 2\n    \n\n        Content 3  \n\n\n```\nComponent:\n```typescript\nexport class TabViewDemo {\nindex: number = 0;\n\nopenNext() {\n    this.index = (this.index === 2) ? 0 : this.index + 1;\n}\n\nopenPrev() {\n    this.index = (this.index === 0) ? 2 : this.index - 1;\n}\n\n}\n``\n. Could you share a Plunkr demonstrating the issue?. This usual means that the property in question isn't declared with an@Inputannotation. [TheshowClearproperty was added in version 5.2.4](https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/a950f8a927138f0ad0dc165ec1b666b828513c48). My guess is that you haven't importedp-dropdown` properly, or you're using an older version of PrimeNG. Can you give us a Plunkr to confirm the behavior?. Just an FYI - if you need to get this working currently, you can modify the app to bind the filters to the component, and then reset those with the table. Example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-cbada-hjvus2\nI wonder if we could implement this with a directive. For example, maybe we can have a pTableFilter directive that can be placed on any ngModel driven control which we can clear automatically when the table is reset. We may be able to scan the table using the @ContentChildren annotation.. You have to give us more information about the error you're getting in order to determine if this is a bug or if you're misusing the component. Does the browser console have any information about the stack trace? Can you reproduce the bug in a plunkr?. @reneefeng This bug is about the <p-table/> component. Your issue seems to be with the <p-tree/> component, so this bug is unrelated. Please open up another bug if you feel you found an error with the framework. Otherwise, if you're just having trouble configuring the component and need support, open up a thread on the user forum. In either case, you'll have to share more code in order to receive help. You can use this stackblitz as a template to demonstrate your issue.. This was fixed in 6.1.0-rc.1. See #6168. I created a branch which implements this feature. Please let me know if anyone has any feedback!. So, I just created pull #6567, which, if accepted, will hopefully fix this. You would have to do something like this:\n``typescript\n@Component({\n    template:\nOptions Here\n\n    `\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n    options: any = {}\n    calendarFirstDay: number\nonFirstDayChange($event: number) {\n    this.options = {firstDay: $event};//have to create a new object to trigger change detection\n}\n\n}\n``.

Spacebar and Alt + (downarrow) get to the dropdown items, but what about the filter?. I am also seeing this.. This would be so useful!\nPossibly, also 'page to selection' if the table is using pagination.. ",
    "daleclements": "This would also be beneficial in ListBox. When something in a list (like a row in a table) is selected programatically it is usually expected that the list will scroll in order to make the newly selected row visible, if it has to.. This is an issue for me too. It's most problematic because the list item is displayed but the model remains null. Showing nothing would probably be preferable, but modifying the model to match the displayed option would be better than what we have now. Right now the model and view are out of sync initially.\nEDIT: As a workaround, you can define a placeholder attribute to display something else, but unfortunately if you just try to put placeholder=\"\" you get the first option and if you put placeholder=\" \" with a space then the input ends up having no height. Something like placeholder=\"...\" can work though.. Hi,\nFor what it's worth, I believe you can use the dataKey table attribute to solve your issue. dataKey specifies which field in your row objects is expected to be the unique identifier. In your plunkr, if I change to:\n<p-dataTable selectionMode=\"single\" [value]=\"myRows\" [(selection)]=\"selectedRow\" dataKey=\"d\">\n    <p-column field=\"d\" header=\"Date\"></p-column>\n    <p-column field=\"t\" header=\"Text\" ></p-column>\n</p-dataTable>\nthen I can select individual rows. Unfortunately I'm sure that if you have two rows with the same date, it will select them both when you select one, so you would want something like an id field even if you don't display it.. Maybe what I expect to happen isn't what is actually supposed to happen?\nSince pressing escape triggers \"onEditCancel\" I thought that it would cancel the edit by default, out-of-the-box. Am I supposed to implement the cancel myself?\nThe reason I thought this is the name of the event. It's not named \"onEscapePressed\" or something else that would imply that implementation is up to me. \"onEditCancel\" tells me that it is an event that is fired when the edit is canceled, but the edit isn't actually cancelled when the event is fired right now, unless I manually cancel it in the handler. Does that make sense?\nIf I don't actually do anything in onEditCancel(event){ }, is it expected that the edit will be cancelled when Escape is pressed?. Okay I think I understand. So actually preventing the edit from applying is something we need to implement ourselves manually by storing the initial value in our onEditInit handler and setting it back to it in the onEditCancel handler.\nYou mentioned event emission using our own edit templates but I'm not sure what you're saying. I did notice that when using a custom edit template, the onEditCancel event is not fired.. For anyone reading this: it only works properly if you remove the max-height from the style in addition to adding it to the listStyle. Otherwise you get this:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/biiWcQnN1Maw7gA9lNPN?p=preview\nIt still doesn't seem like a proper solution because it prevents you from keeping your style information in your stylesheets and forces you to keep it in the template..

I myself am working on creating a wrapper on p-datatable and need something to handle this.. @mmikeyy Thanks for sharing the fix with us.\n@sudheerj Any chance this can land into the official repo? If required someone can send a PR for this.. Hi @cagataycivici , just checking if the solution by @mmikeyy is valid and does not affect anywhere else. If this works, then we should be able to merge this in the official repo. If you wish, I can create the PR with the exact fix (all credits to @mmikeyy  though).\n . @blhussey @bakasmarius This was taken in v 4.1.1. Can you please update and verify ?. @baigail93  You will have to create a container component which implements this method and returns the reference to the child div in this case.. This should also be done for onRowClick event as well. @cagataycivici . I do not see any issue in the plunkr here. Can you please elaborate the issue with an example in the comment. This will clarify it a bit.. @aebmknrl This is because you are setting the newTask.end = newTask.start. Hence the model is bound to the date object which is also associated with the start date. You can do this newTask.end = new Date(newTask.start).. Yes because the date object is set as  a reference and ngModel is bound to the same reference. You can close this issue now as this is not an issue with the control.. I am encountering this issue in unit tests but not in actual runtime. This is because of the fact that lazyLoad function is being called in ngOnInit of datatable which is called by Change Detector. As mentioned by @burhanyldz this goes away when initial value of loading is true. Problem still persists. I tried overiding the findCell method to go up to the parent where it finds the actual TD element with class 'ui-editable-column' but this gives the error that parentNode is null after reaching TR element of the calendar.. Yes Here is the gif for the same\n\nThis is because in handleRowClick tries to find the parent td for getting the editable cell. However in case of calendar, it gets a different td (in calendar template) and that throws the code off. I tried to modify the code to find the td with the given proper editable class .ui-editable-cell by going up the chain recursively. However it breaks in the middle when it can't find the parent to tr of the calendar. I was not able to solve that part. \n. This could also be done by providing a function called dateClasswhich takes the given date as an argument and returns a string.\nThis would be same as rowClassin Primeng Datatable. @vpnocsen this is released in 4.2.rc1. You can see this in action in the showcase.. The same thing is happening with me when I use the rowStyleClass property. If the function returns anything (including null and undefined), it starts behaving this way. On investigation I found that all the classes ui-datatable-even, ui-datatable-odd, ui-datatable-highlight were added to the row. (This are present in ngClass attribute on tr element in the template of datatable tBody). My guess was that using [class] along with ngClass is causing an issue. I tried changing the datatable.js code so that all the classes are being returned from the getRowStyleClass method of datatable and I removed the [ngClass] directive from the template. This behaved in the expected way.. Is this the same as #1827 ?. @cagataycivici This breaks tabview and fileupload as per this #4839 . This is a very big breaking change.. ",

",
    "laserus": "@cagataycivici I suggested a PR for better addressing of this. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/2583. I have faced the same and thought that it could be due to usage of [class] and [ngClass] in the same element. Fixed this with moving rule for [class] to ngClass, and unfortunately [ngClass] cannot work as this: \n[ngClass]=\"{'my-class': condition, [dt.getRowStyle(rowData, index)]:true}\"\nSee here http://stackoverflow.com/a/37091299/5851804. Thus, I had to change the ngClass to array of classnames.\nAdded PR.. There was a little bit different, but resembling issue: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/607\nAlthough the issue in stale state.. Ok, found solution:\nthis.onRowClick.next({originalEvent: event, data: rowData});. Please, find some explanation on design in https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1827. A little bit of explanation how I use the rowStyleMap feature:\ntemplate.html:\n<p-dataTable \n            ...\n            [rowStyleMap]=\"rowStyleMap\"\n            (onRowClick)=\"selectClicked($event.data)\"\n            dataKey=\"my_collection_id\">\n</p-dataTable>\ncomponent.ts:\n```\n    rowStyleMap = {};\n    selectClicked(rowData) {\n        this.selectedRow= rowData;\n    this.rowStyleMap = {\n        [rowData.my_collection_id] : 'table-info'\n    };\n}\n\n```\nThat's all, now I can tag rows as selected with bootstrap styles and do some operations on top of it.. @cagataycivici rowDataMap only depends on dataKey, not all possible values, if some row has a year older than 2010 and user wants to reflect it, then user put into the map that the row should have specific color. The user has all control of own data as well as many @Output events from the datatable itself, and can react in any way he wants to the changes (reflecting it into rowDataMap). \nSo it adds flexibility and correct scoping compared to rowDataStyle.\nIn the example above I bind my rowStyleMap which is updated on event. On each onRowClick event I create a new object, with needed data. I can add and remove data from within, but I will need a separate object to push update I guess (e.g. lodash/clone, or Object.assign({}...))?. @cagataycivici what about fix for [ngClass] and [class]. When they are on the same element for me and others it produces incorrect styles (could be some angular bug???). Will you fix it or do I need a separate PR for that?. @cagataycivici you mean PR, not issue? Issue is already created by somebody else: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1827. @cagataycivici it is different. My improvement from callback function to object map is related to this: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1416\nBut there is a second error, that is when rowStyleClass function is used it tries to applies [class]=\"dt.getRowStyleClass(rowData,rowIndex)\" and that thing breaks [ngClass]. \nYes, probably it is only because callback scoping breaks something related to angular. I do not know. But the fix that I suggest about that, fixes this issue without need to redesign rowStyleClass yet.. I have tested locally different options, and whenever I have tried to bind to [class] this error happens... I haven't found a way to fix it othewise. No zone or changedetector helped.. @cagataycivici after some thinking, have you ever seen binding to class like that [class] and not some specific [class.my-class] or [ngClass]? Previously, I have seen this direct binding to class, but not anymore. I have checked the code at angular/angular and do not find it...\nE.g., like that: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8d300ffbfc7d46aa543bf04d0b41c26c6e2e5a9f/aio/src/app/layout/nav-item/nav-item.component.ts#L15\nand  https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8d300ffbfc7d46aa543bf04d0b41c26c6e2e5a9f/aio/src/app/layout/nav-item/nav-item.component.html#L2\nHere is list from angular code base: https://github.com/angular/angular/search?p=1&q=class+extension%3A.html&type=&utf8=%E2%9C%93. found that bootstrap was deprecated..

Hi @frabock,\nThanks for your suggestion.\nThis is just an example to show when this happens, in my project there is two ways to achieve the same problem.\nIn one case I have a tab panel that changes the table data, in another one is a couple of fields that filter the data, it doesn't seem to be nice to the user to block the tabs or the fields, you know? it would be too \"blocking\" the user to do something, and maybe the user just regretted to change the value, if he doesn't remember the initial value it would be required that he filled with anything else (or refresh the page)..

I've made one lib for masking, one of the first things that i built was a directive for primeng calendar.\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/racoon-mask\nit's quite simple and solve most of the directive problems, if anyone find anything that could improve it, this is the github link :)\nhttps://github.com/shogogan/racoon-mask\nit has two directives, but the main one here is the [rPCalendarMask], no inputs, no outputs, it just gets the dateformat and builds a mask on it (with time included if wanted)\nusage:\nHTML:\n<p-calendar rPCalendarMask></p-calendar>. Just informing that i changed the mask lib name (racoon-lib to racoon-mask).\nAnd now it can show the placeholder like __/__/____\nand it is working pretty better (with a early stage of a showcase to try on while testing)\nAnd I put it on version 1.0.0 right now. \ud83d\ude04 \nstill needs some improvements, but by now it's working on android/ios chrome/ie10\nAny issue just report or open a PR :).

For help fixing this error see https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Troubleshooting#name-is-not-exported-by-module. Added a plunker that is similar, but not exact. The plunker will fail as is. If you load the CalendarModule from primeng directly instead of from primeng/components/calendar/calendar it will work. \n\nFails:\nimport { CalendarModule  } from 'primeng/components/calendar/calendar';\nWorks: \nimport { CalendarModule  } from 'primeng';\nI noticed the plunker defines map within systemjs.config.js as such:\n'primeng':                   'npm:primeng@1.0.0-rc.6/primeng.js'\nYet on the setup doc it defines the map as such:\n'primeng':                   'npm:primeng'\nI tried changing the definition to include the js file, but still no luck\n. Let's please not dismiss this with \"Not my problem\" when I did provide a plunker that has an issue and that plunker is forked from yours with no changes made to the systemjs.config file.. Oddly enough, the issue I am seeing is the opposite of the plunker I sent. It works fine when importing from the calendar folder but fails when importing from primeng. I did get mine to work.

This is also a problem for us in a SPA type layout where the table must flow to fill the remaining space of the body.  We are trying to use scrollHeight=\"100%\" and the layout looks ok when the initial page loads but then if any window resize, the table does not change height as it should when using percent-based scrollHeight.. Related to p-table height: In our table, we have a ui-table-caption which is taller than normal, because it contains some form controls.\np-table does not seem to correctly take into account the height of our custom caption, so the height computation is always about 20 pixels too short.. The Dogger has solved it with CSS:\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-sbrx4k\nTake a look in my styles.css at the table-scroll class\nThe hardcoded 29px header height might need to be tweaked in individual cases.. Agree with @brian428 that this should be opt-in.\nIn addition, please consider adding a css class to the parent ui-dropdown whenever the clear icon is present (suggest ui-dropdown-clearable).  That way my app's css can adjust, or even hide, the presentation of the clear icon based on the parent class, instead of having to target all dropdowns.. Related to #5285 and #5286. this has a typo.  will submit it again. I noticed also on this page:\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/dialog\nUnder the header for Styling it says \"Following is the list of structural style classes, for theming classes visit theming page.\"\nThis links to the theming page but there is no list of structural style classes there, as implied by the link text.  Just the ads for PrimeNG paid products.. Is there not a theming guide?  As implied by the docs on the TurboTable page, I was hoping to find some list of classes for theming.  How is developer instructed to theme their app for their requirements?  The Guide page links not to a guide.. ",

    "spike83": "@cagataycivici Thanks for your review and comment.\nI opend the issue #1585. You can simply reproduce the problem in showcase by removing the null option from this.cities array. In this case the dropdown will show 'New York' and the value in model is null.\nIn the issue is a plunker.\nSo, to avoid this and other problems like not matching values coming from the model, the drop down component should override the incoming value with some kind of \u2018default value\u2019.\nIn my opinion the first option is not every time the best default option, so I made it possible to provide a default value.\nIt\u2019s absolutely right, the formControl is from reactive forms. As you can see in my pull request, I want to check if a matching option is set when writeValue is called but in case of Reactive Forms it is called once and when the value is provided via ngModel it it's called a second time. So, I was looking for a way to find out if the component is used with reactive forms or not.\nWhat should be improved to become this sound good for you?\n. I agree for simple cases this is a workaround. But IMHO the dropdown control is made to restrict the value to a specific set of values defined by options. If one would like to allow null, it's ok and done by a specific option with value null. \nI think the dropdown should make sure the value coming out is always one of the options list. And what you see is what you get in the model. Always and handled by the dropdown.. This is correct for some browsers like chrome. In IE it's diffrent. There the first Option is showing up but model is null.\nThe dropdown component is absolute necessary to make the behavior consistent over all browsers.. ",

    "bmstambaugh": "I am having the same issues as well in Angular 4x and PrimNG 4.0.0-rc.3. This was going to be my next submitted issue until I found this.. Same issue, but to add once resized the column headers and the column cells no longer line up.. I would like to same. While resizable columns are an option sometimes its just easier for the user to hover over the cell without affecting the whole table.. My workaround for this is to use the Tooltip component and a template cell.\n<p-column field=\"Col1\" header=\"Col1\" [sortable]=\"true\" [style]=\"{'width':'200px'}\">\n        <ng-template let-col let-data=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n            <span [pTooltip]=\"data[col.field]\" tooltipPosition=\"top\">{{ data[col.field] }}</span>\n        </ng-template>\n    </p-column> \nand override the class\n.ui-datatable .ui-datatable-thead>tr>th, .ui-datatable .ui-datatable-tfoot>tr>td, .ui-datatable .ui-datatable-data>tr>td  {\n    text-overflow: ellipsis; \n    overflow : hidden; \n    white-space: nowrap;\n}. I completely agree. Having it built in would save a lot of HTML markup . It would appear all editable cells get a height set to 36px and the frozen non editable cells have a height of 28px by default.  By adding td { height: 36px; } to my css file I can fix the issue quite easily, but the desired effect should be that both frozen and unfrozen rows should all have the same height applied.. This is weird because I am using the same version in my current app I am developing and the sorting works fine. Also see this plnkr I made yesterday to show a different issue I am having. Sorting is working just fine there. http://plnkr.co/edit/gZGid81oodPX8RwRC4bm\nThe strange thing is that in your plnkr, in which I presume you used the template just as I had, I am able to reproduce the issue you describe. \nI took your example and added more rows so that paging actually has something to do to see if that was the issue, but it was not. However, If you now click on the header to sort and then choose one of the other pages the table will then be sorted by the column you clicked on. http://plnkr.co/edit/lpwwylWn87nKPXqmrqXD. I'm sorry I included the wrong plnk in the first link. I didn't give you the forked version with paginator set to true. Try this one http://plnkr.co/edit/JizxgHpxAdNp6wnT53XS  You cannot see the paging which is an affect of the other bug I made the original plnk about, but sorting is working as expected.. After some digging I finally agve in and just ran a diff on our two examples and found I had \n'primeng':                   'npm:primeng@4.0.0-rc.1/primeng.js'\nin the systemjs file. Which is why sorting is working as expected in my example. This also happens to be the version in the plnkr we are supposed to fork when creating a bug report, explaining why I had that version. \nWhen I change to rc4 then I too experience the same sorting problems. I also tested rc.2 and rc.3 and both seem to be working as expected as well. So it appears that rc4 is when sorting has broken.. Looks to here. Thanks for the quick fix @cagataycivici . I've been working on pinpointing this issue for a week now and haven't found where the bug is exactly, but I can confirm that the underlying value will be set to the max if you type an number that exceeds max. The display of the control is just incorrect. The correct max value is returned form the parseValue method.\n```\nparseValue(val: string): number {\n        let value: number;\n    if(this.formatInput) {\n        val = val.split(this.thousandSeparator).join('');\n    }\n\n    if(val.trim() === '') {\n        value= this.min !== undefined ? this.min : null;\n    }\n    else {        \n        if(this.precision) {\n            value = parseFloat(val.replace(',','.'));\n        }\n        else {\n            value = parseInt(val);\n        }\n\n        if(!isNaN(value)) {\n            if(this.max !== undefined && value > this.max) {\n                value = this.max;\n            }\n\n            if(this.min !== undefined && value < this.min) {\n                value = this.min;\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            value = null;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return value;\n}\n\n```. @Sergeon To add to your comment. This is a problem with typing in the same value as MAX. Change MAX to 999 and type 9999. The correction will not be displayed, however as mentioned in the last comment the actual underlying value will be correct as the IF condition was met.. ",

You can currently actually say which columns you want to export but it is slightly hacky (in my opinion) and definitely not recorded in the docs.\nAs you can see here\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/app/components/datatable/datatable.ts#L2137\nthe exportCsv function is base don the data table and specifically makes sure you have data AND a column with the FIELD property that is truthy (e.g. not null / undefined /empty string).\nBecause of this you can actually do something sneaky and say\nin html\n<p-dataTable #dt [value]=\"data\" exportFilename=\"data-objects\">\n      <p-header>\n          <button type=\"button\" pButton icon=\"fa-download\" iconPos=\"left\" label=\"Download CSV\" (click)=\"export(dt)\"></button>\n      </p-header>\n      <p-column *ngFor=\"let col of cols\" [hidden]=\"col.hide\" [sortable]=\"col.sortable\" [field]=\"col.field [header]=\"col.header\">\n      </p-column>\n    </p-dataTable>\nin component\n```\n  public export(e: DataTable) {\n     // store the columns you want to not export\n    const hiddenColumns: any[] = [];\n    e.columns.forEach((c) => {\n       // search for whatever criteria you care for.  in my use case if the column is hidden i don't want to export that data\n      if (c.hidden === true ) {\n        hiddenColumns.push({field: c.field, col: c});\n        c.field = '';\n      }\n    });\ne.exportCSV();\n// restore their fields so databinding and such still works in the future\nhiddenColumns.forEach((hc) => {\n  hc.col.field = hc.field;\n});\n\n}\n```\nso instead of just calling dt.exportCSV() I've done some pre processing the datatable's data that it uses in the export function.  \nWhat would probably be preferable is there are API settings  that hook into this function that only show fields based on either callback criteria or setting criteria.

I'm considering contributing export changes but don't know where I can.. @cagataycivici Ahh I see\nDataTable\nMore export options like pdf and excel\nState saving featuring across views\nCell Selection\nFrozen Rows\nis planned and i see that might be for 4.1.1 but I don't know how long major/minor patches take. \nAs a part of it I would also suggest an onExport callback be created in order to change the way the field is exported as well as changing the default export to use JSON.stringify() because currently objects are exported as [object: OBJECT] unless you explicitly implement .toString()\nAlso the csvSeparator field currently work the way you'd expect.  yes it adds the separator in between each field but it does not at sep={yourSeparator} to the top of the file (as most csv parsers like excel would expect). I investigated this and for some reason it is taking the width of the first column to be the new body width and not the original body width with all the columns. Upon further investigation it turns out all that needs to happen is when the columns are stacked it needs to do a width 100% !important in order to override the styles set on the columns initially with  [style]\nWhen i applied this\ncss\n.ui-datatable-reflow .ui-datatable-data > tr > td {\n        width: 100% !important;\n      }\neverything worked fine.  in the actual library we'd want to add either that or add to the existing lib style\ncss\n@media ( max-width: 35em ) {\n    .ui-datatable-reflow .ui-datatable-data > tr > td {\n        text-align: left;\n        display: block;\n        border: 0 none;\n        width: 100% !important;  /*-- HERE --*/\n        -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n        -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n        box-sizing: border-box;\n        float: left;\n        clear: left;\n    }\n}\n@cagataycivici  this is a very easy fix if you would like to to make a PR for it.. @kamran-pervaiz Make sure when you do the add it is using an IMMUTABLE object.  What I mean by that is when you add the data you should not use\ndata.push({});\nyou should instead use\ndata = data.concat({});\nor \ndata = [...data, {}];\nThis is explained under managing data\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable\nDataTable uses setter based checking to realize if the underlying data has changed to update the UI so your data changes such as adding or removing a record should always create a new array reference instead of manipulating an existing array. For example, use slice instead of splice when removing an item or use spread operator instead of push method when adding an item.\nThe reason is all the components use ChangeDetectorStrategy.OnPush in order to not update too many components when adding or removing elements.. on each of the nested object append a toString() function that emits what you actually want to show in the export.  That's how I handled it.  I have special classes for complex object exports that all implement .toString(). @cagataycivici  where are the contributing rules??. Oh okay. It just seemed odd to me that the onvirtualscroll event returns\nthe page to go to but clicking a page didn't exactly return where to scroll\nto.

Ok, I see your point. I just tested original Select implementation with Angular2: when model is null or undefined  dropdown shows nothing (white field) as selected value.. oops, duplicate of https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/674. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/milestone/75?closed=1. I think it works. You just need to assign field property to 2nd column. Probably that should be mentioned in docs or add guard/throw exception in case if sortable and no field provided.. It works, you have to add [style]=\"{'overflow':'visible'}\" to p-column that holds dropdown. Same is reflected in demo.. Your plunker works fine for me.

Currently that is NOT possible. All pagination parameters set to dataTable are ignored, until [paginator]=true is set. But now there is NO way to hide built-in paginators.\nOne more request: it would be nice to have same parameter names for paginator (pageLinkSize) and dataTable (pageLinks).. I think initial problem (feature to hide paginator) is fixed. Thanks to primeNg team.  PLEASE CLOSE THIS TICKET\n@sabithpocker if your tables are lazyloaded, then you have to handle pagination event manually.

Dear @cagataycivici , for multiple emails, tab key is also a common choice.\nI created issue 3527 asking for this feature. \nThanks. Thanks @SIlver--, that seems like a good approach. I'm going to try it right now.\nWould be nice to have it natively though.\nUPDATE AFTER SUCCESSFULLY TRYING @SIlver--'s approach\nFor fully understanding the case\n\"Productos Disponibles\" means \"Available Products\"\n\"Productos Contratados\" means \"Contracted Products\"\n\"Codigo\" means \"Code\"\n\"Descripcion\" means \"Description\"\nHTML\n```\n\n         <ng-template let-prod pTemplate=\"item\">\n              <div (dblclick)=\"moveItem($event, prod)\" class=\"ui-helper-clearfix\">\n                  {{prod.descripcion}}\n              </div>\n         </ng-template>\n\n\n```\nTS\n```\npublic moveItem(event, prod){\n    if (event.path[2].className.indexOf(\"ui-picklist-source\")>-1){\n        this.productosContratados.push(prod);\n        this.productosDisponibles.splice(this.productosDisponibles.findIndex(pp=>pp.codigo == prod.codigo), 1);\n    }else{\n        this.productosDisponibles.push(prod);\n        this.productosContratados.splice(this.productosContratados.findIndex(pp=>pp.codigo == prod.codigo), 1);\n    }\n} \n```\nIn this case event.path[2].className.indexOf(\"ui-picklist-source\")>-1 helps me to easily know in which list the product actually is, in order to move it to the other one. Yes, if I change the ng-template contents it will most probably stop working because of the hardcoded index for event.path but it's not that hard to find once it stops working.\nHope this example helps anyone visiting this issue. Nevertheless, I insist that it would be a great feature for the component!. Hi, thanks @cagataycivici for implementig the tab button functionality.\nTesting it I've found that you cannot focus next field when chips input element is empty.\nHere is the issue for that \"bug\"(\u00bf?), guess so, because you get trapped in the component when addOnTab is enabled\nThanks!.

Possibly setting some \"cancel\" value in onAdding() that when true would cause onAdd() to not fire. \nWe need to take the value entered by the user and apply it to a REST service and then take the value returned from that service and add a value to the chips array. Right now, nice by the time onAdd() fires the value has already been added to the list, I immediately remove the newly added value, apply it to the REST service, and then add a new value to the array based on the service response.  \nMy two cents. .

Why you close this PR?. What tests are you did?. @cagataycivici can you test the issue in this plunkr please? http://plnkr.co/edit/B7TAfxtZSYLxhIKIV2Be?p=preview. @cagataycivici with the 5.2.4 the error persists.

You can check the migration steps here -> https://update.angular.io/\n. I think that the point is not to remove rules from tslint. I guess the action to do should be do the code following the Angular standards.. Same here!. For now is not possible @rashnk. If you want to achieve this behaviour you should use the collapsed attribute and manage manually the value.\nTake care about this solution because if you use this way, you loose the event onBeforeToggle. This seems to be a bug, what do you think @cagataycivici ?\nAnyway I think this is a common behaviour that can be an option of this component.. @cagataycivici if you want I can do the PR, it's very easy, just use the following code:\nOn the template (panel.ts):\nhtml\n(@panelContent.start)=\"onToggleStart($event)\"\nOn the component (panel.ts):\njavascript\nonToggleStart(event: Event) {\n  this.animating = true;\n  this.onBeforeToggle.emit({originalEvent: event, collapsed: this.collapsed});\n}\nAnd remove the lines 85-86 from the panel.ts.

Same here!. +1 both: customization and disable. @cagataycivici you have some news about this?. Thanks a lot @cagataycivici. @cagataycivici Would you accept a PR for this feature?.

Although in my case I have a multiple selection datatable where I need to display a number of rows but also need to disable selection for some of them.. Thx. Thanks for the information!\nGood to know that this works bidirectional.\n@cagataycivici Maybe another pointer to enhance the documentation.. +1\nWas actually looking for this today. . Was this fix tested with IE?\nI have implemented similar functionality before and had to use\nlet input: string;\n        if (typeof event.clipboardData === 'undefined') {\n            //Internet Explorer\n            input = (<any>window).clipboardData.getData('Text');\n        } else {\n            //all other browsers\n            input = event.clipboardData.getData('Text');\n        }\nbefore testing the regex.. Thanks for trying.\nOne difference I can see is the version of IE\nI am currently using \nWindows 7 x64\n11.0.9600.19266 \n11.0.110 (KB4486474)\nor\nWindows Server 2012 R2\n11.0.9600.19204\n11.0.100 (KB4470199)\nThis is an enterprise environment so I can not easily install different versions..

    "external-olgierd": "Create a pull request with a fix for this issue and also 1689 as they are related.\nThe first of my commits should be ignored as it was done against incorrect branch/fork.\nhjalmers pull request is good and adds good functionality to allow specification of \"disabled\" dates, but I have created a pull request that fixes only the problem at hand, i.e. that selectOtherMonths option is not working properly - just to minimize the changes and potential impact.\nSummary of the changes:\n- applied disabled CSS class for days in other months only if the above option is not set to \"true\"\n- year for dateMeta object is calculated properly now for next month (previously it was only working for previous months or for next months only in case if the year was also incremented)\n- made sure that \"selectable\" property of dateMeta is set correctly for dates in other month (i.e. set to false if selectOtherMonths is not set to \"true\" and set to true otherwise) - this is to make sure other month dates behaves the same as other ones - if they can be selected they act as enabled ones but if they cannot be selected they behave the same as disabled dates (i.e. when click on them calendar doesnt close down)\n. Created pull-request for this as part of fix for 1689.. This is the same issue as #2026 and only affects calendar in IE11 when placeholder is applied.\nThe underlying problem here is the way IE11 handles placeholder and field focus. When the focus is set/unset, the placeholder is removed/added which actually triggers onInput event (unlike other browsers).\np-calendar relies on this event and its actually blocking the other events so the date is not updated properly when selected in the datepicker for the first time.\nThere is no easy way of fixing that it seems (altho I think its fixed in Edge by Microsoft...). I have tried changing the 'onInput' binding to either one keypress/keyup/keydown and it seems to work for all browsers, although again in IE11 when you focus on the field initially to open datepicker, the placeholder will be removed and then when you select the date, the input loses focus and set the placeholder value back for split second before replacing that with the actual date value, so you end up with placeholder \"flickering\" for a moment.. @piowro That fixes an issue but have few side effects, the most major of which is the fact that you cant tab through calendar components in IE11 anymore.. A fix for #2081 should also resolve this issue. Pull request added.. @alialtun14 I suggest you log a new issue with relevant plunkr for autocomplete component. Probably the best way to get it fixed quickly.. I dont think its an issue, I think its a bug in your code in the plunker.\nYou bind the checkboxes to \"checked\" property of the your model items but when updating values you change the \"isChecked\" property instead so that change is never detected by the component.\nI have forked your plunker and updated some code and it seems to work fine now - please have a look.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/R5otr5DSB6dt99gqQStO?p=preview. If any of the maintainers prefer to do that with a setter/getter rather than OnChange then I can modify the code.. This should be a simple change, just wondering though whats the purpose of using this component over normal  with password type if you dont want the strength meter to be displayed?. I think the best way to get it looked at/resolved is to follow the issue logging guidelines and include plunkr showing your problem.. This should be resolved with the fix for #1689 and #1935 as essentially its the same problem.. Can you not use [selected] input on the relevant p-tabPanel to achieve this?. See below plunker, if you bind it properly this should work as expected.\nUnless change detection is not triggered for some reason - are you using OnPush in your parent component or something?\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/W2unKTLPDa8Yg5aoxgKH?p=preview. Honestly I dont think there is anything wrong with that plunker. I would consider that cleaner solution than trying to call child component method from the parent programmatically, which is what you seem to want. I'd rather manipulate the input variable but thats just me.. Seems like the same issue as #1594.. That is not necessarily a calendar issue. Do you mind creating a plunker reproducing an issue?. ",

Is there any way to programmatically default to the first item in the suggestion list, without having to click the down arrow key? \nThis makes even more sense if there's only one option is the suggestion list. Currently, the user always has to use the down arrow key to select the value, which seem redundant and forces an extra keyboard transaction for every search. \nE.g Spain should be preselected here\n\n. @davladus I was able to get this functionality by dispatching a down arrow key event to the autocomplete component at the end of the completeMethod callback. Less than ideal solution but easy to refactor out later if PrimeNG adds native support (or I get around to adding it myself). \nWorking code:\nts\nimport { AutoComplete } from 'primeng/primeng';\nts\n@ViewChild(AutoComplete) primeAutoCompleteComponent: AutoComplete;\nts\n    // (completeMethod)=\"search($event)\"    \n    search(event?: any) {\n        // filter you search results array\n        . . .    \n        this.preSelectFirstOptionInResultsList();\n    }\n```ts\nprivate preSelectFirstOptionInResultsList(): void {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n    let highlightItemIndex = this.primeAutoCompleteComponent.findOptionIndex(this.primeAutoCompleteComponent.highlightOption);\n\n    if (highlightItemIndex < 0) {\n        var arrowDownEvent = document.createEvent('Event');\n        (<any>arrowDownEvent).initEvent('keydown', { \"bubbles\": false, \"cancelable\": false });\n        Object.defineProperty(arrowDownEvent, 'which', { 'value': 40 });\n\n        (<Node>this.primeAutoCompleteComponent.input).dispatchEvent(arrowDownEvent);\n    }\n\n}, 0);\n\n}\n```\n.

Note that in the example using the bootstrap thema the Toast component has no style.\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-template-rqzyrm?file=app%2Fapp.component.html\nSee for yourself the new-colored thema file, it has for example the \"body .ui-toast .ui-toast-message.ui-toast-message-info\" classes, since the bootstrap thema does not.\nBelow is the link of themas.\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/assets/components/themes/nova-colored/theme.css\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/src/assets/components/themes/bootstrap/theme.css\n@cagataycivici . You are using the display property none, but you would only use an if.. @krishna1990fis \nSee the model property of the Steps class.

So you just set the true value to the disabled property of the MenuItem object that you pass to the step component model.. @cagataycivici \nIt is not passing the tests because now the file-upload request is performed by httpClient, we would have to change the tests by making a mock of httpClient..

Change by css, below is an example.\nbody .ui-table tbody .ui-state-highlight {\n    background: #e0e0e0;\n}. @sgentile some time ago I added the style in the bootstrap thema css, but it was disapproved because that thema was discontinued.. > I had the same issue today in version 7.0.5, the response was an empty formData and hadn't the xhr, I installed the version 7.0.5 and the response it's OK, I needed get the response for add the token in the header in onBeforeSend callback:\n\npublic addHeader(event) {\nevent.xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', Bearer ${this.uploadService.getToken()});\n}\nI suggest to you use the version 7.0.4, set \"primeng\": \"7.0.4\" in package.json\n\nYou can now add the token by the httpclient interceptor.. > there is no possibility to get response\n\nprimeng 6:\nonUpload(event: any) {\nconst uploadedDocuments = JSON.parse(event.xhr.responseText);\nprimeng 7:\nonUpload(event: any) {\nconst uploadedDocuments = JSON.parse(event.xhr.responseText);\nevent.xhr is undefined.\nBut i don't see any other possibility to obtain response in primeng7.(in our case response contains file id that was created on the backend side)\n\nIn the previous version of the primeng was not used the httpclient to send the file, it was done by XMLHttpRequest, so the xhr was returned.\nReturning the proper event of httpclient I believe it solves this problem for you..

    "remmeier": "or ideally it should be able to format the output with moment.js and the appropriate locales. potentially it should be possible to replace the implementation of that equals method. WTF? would you please properly implement that method or remove support for it altogher and throw an error.. itemTemplates only affects the elements in the dropdown. The pipe also adjusts the contents of the input control. This means the autoComplete components becomes enabled to bind to complex objects with ngModel and to format those objects for display in the input control and dropdown. With support for this, it is not necessary to workaround this outside of the autocomplete component.\nThere is already rudimentary support for this with \"field\" and resolveFieldData. The pipe, however, is more generic and allows more powerful customizations. Looking at it again, I think the logic for the two should be merged.. I think it is a bit of a more general issue in primeng. With a similar pattern in Calendar you could resolve https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1810 as well.. but the current template does only allow to customize the dropdown???. not the input field. A commercial one would be perfectly fine. We see lots of companies having bootstrap theming. So if primeng could built a theme on top of those saas files, that would be great. Currently it rather means that new applications get built with valor/ng2 bootstrap, even tough primeng provides a superior widget set.\nThe current bootstrap css theme imitating the not so pretty default bootstrap theming is probably not of that much help to most people.. yes, I'm aware that primeng has its own set of classes. And that is a good thing to the most part. But from a  expectation point of view it would be great to see:\n\nan existing application using bootstrap\nhaving invested a lot of time in styling it (with saas)\nintegrate the primeng bootstap theme \nprimeng components takeover that styling from bootstrap (maybe to 80%, as primeng has various more advanced things)\n\nmaybe that is achievable by setting up sass inclusions in an application like:\nbootstrap sass -> custom bootstrap styling sass -> primeng bootstrap sass -> some more custom primeng styling\nwhere the primeng bootstrap saas would extend the classes from bootstrap as far as possible with the sass @extend mechanism. How well/far that mapping would work, not sure. But it may be able to cover all the basics, because the barrier of using primeng in a project can otherwise be quite high due to the investments in bootstrap that is already in place.\n. ",

It fails even if, in thesubscribecallback, I defer theloadingchange with a longsetTimeout` call:\n```javascript\nloadDataLazy(event: LazyLoadEvent) {\nthis.loading = true;\n  this.service.getFilteredData(event).subscribe( res => {\n      this.data = res.data;\n      this.total = res.total;\n      setTimeout( () => {\n          this.loading = false; // This will fire the exception when reached\n  } , 4000 );\n\n} );\n}\n```\nI didn't know wether to comment here or open a new issue, sorry if that would be more proper. I'll open a new issue on request.\n. Also, there's a strange behaviour related to input speed: (I'm considering the setup of the very same plunkr from the issue description)\nTyping '1001' really fast will lead to the [max] constraint working properly, and the input value to be set to '100'.

It looks like this has maybe been fixed.  In the documentation, it now just has you putting content directly in a  tag, without any inner div with classes.  When I removed the inner div from my code, it now looks how it should. . +1\nIf, say, certain tabs are in *ngIfs, there's no obvious way to know the index of a particular tab.  . If I pass down the date string \"07/27/2010 12:00:00 AM\", it shows up as \"07/27/2010 12:00:00 PM\" in the input box.  If I manually change the PM to AM, it changes back to PM.  This is a pretty serious issue, since it can interpret dates a whole 12 hours off.  \n(Tested with PrimeNG 5.2.3)\nEDIT:  Here's a Plunkr that demonstrates this:  http://plnkr.co/edit/A5PUxHVTk4TNub60qDEd?p=preview\nIt turns out that, at the start of this scenario, even though it says PM in the textbox, the actual bound value string still says AM.  But if you change PM to AM in the textbox, both the textbox and the value string say PM. \n(This particular problem may just occur when dataType=\"string\".) . It just became available, and it works! Thanks! :). @bias-keenly In your Plunk, when sorting by Vin or Color, you end up with three groups, labelled \"Brand B\", \"Brand A\", and then \"Brand B\" again. Looking at the p-dataTable documentation, it looks like the Subheader row group functionality is supposed to behave like this, so this is at least better than the way the p-table documentation works with sorting.  \nAnother possibly desirable behavior is for the groups to stick together, e.g., there's always \"Brand A\", then \"Brand B\", and you can sort the columns within those groups.\n. I think this is a duplicate of #4958 . Thanks!. I was unable to get this to work with the above StackBlitz demo, but as pointed out in #5578, this issue can be seen in the PrimeNG documentation:\n\nAlso, it happens in this plunk, if you make the window smaller: \nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/7TMm1G7aV7LUZTFwlOb5?p=preview. Yes, I think it would be better if pKeyFilter always considered empty input valid, since if we want a field to be required, we can just mark it required. . Fixed: see #5047\nThanks!. Seems to have been fixed! . My temp fix for this is to set [style]=\"{'display':'flex'}\" on the p-messages, and then set ui-messages-icon to have a right margin. \nEdit: In order to make it look right when the text is short, I added:\n.ui-messages ul {\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: center;\n}. Duplicate of #2622, except that issue also asks for a checkbox to check / uncheck an entire group (which would be helpful).  . This is fixed in version 5.2.7. We had a non-required Social Security Number input field using an input mask.  Typing something in the field and then deleting it would make the form invalid.  We eventually figured out that it was because the form control's value was \"___-__-____\", as opposed to \"\".  We ended up having to remove the input mask.  I assume this is the same issue. \n@ataramez Fyi, your StackBlitz link isn't working for me (on Chrome or Edge).  The loading bar gets almost to the end and then it stops moving.. Thank you, that does fix the problem!  :)  \nHowever, it does seem odd that this would be the default behavior. It seems like, if the min height is 150px, the main body of the dialog should expand to fill the extra space at the bottom, rather than it appearing as an empty footer (in the case of the StackBlitz) or a transparent region (in the case of our website).  .

Wish I could jump in and help!  I think exposing native preventDefault() is just right.. Yes, I too am having a real problem with not having onBlur event at table or cell level.  We are saving row data when user tabs out of last column, or user clicks in another row field.  When user clicks in field of another row, we lose context of previous row so have to make a work around.. Will be great when ready!  Looks like export not included in primeng.d.ts.  Also, can't tell for sure by think sidebar.d.ts needs to implement ngOnDestroy in class declaration.  In the demo page source code, there are a bunch of closing curly braces that make for unusable code if someone copies/pastes from there.  Hope that helps!  \nAh, and the export is missing from primeng.js, I believe.  Yes -- that does the trick.  On to testing.  Thank you!. @pantonis ,  PR is pending:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/4116. @pantonis , what does one have to do to get a PR reviewed? Thx.. Lol.  Ok -- I'd love to  help more, but may hold off on that!  Thx, @pantonis . @jvkusto, do you not see it in the PR?. @jvkusto ,  I must be missing something.

    "Cito": "Also, it would be nice if the data table could be forced to a height that is a multiple of the row heights, so that the last row is fully visible and there is a proper bottom border. That looks so much better.. Resetting the column widths whenever the columns are toggled may solve this problem. See #4150.. What do you mean with \"is not working\"?\nWhen you're using lazy loading data, you must do the sorting via the lazy load event, e.g. by passing the sortField of the lazy load event as a query parameter that will then be used for the order by clause in an SQL database.\nThis worked pretty well for me. When changing the sort order, I get the sortField in the lazy load event, and the pagination starts on page 1 again. The only problem I observed is that the scroll position of the component does not jump back to the start.. You must be doing something strange. I have an example with over 200,000 rows which are sorted and displayed in an instant with lazy loading in PrimeNG. As I explained, I'm sorting the full set on the database only and lazy load only the portion of rows that is displayed. You still seem to sort on the client which is not possible with lazy loading since you don't have the full data set on the client.. When you fetch the full data set, you're not lazy loading but eager loading.\nYou need to have a service that allows sorting. Here is an example using a public REST API:\n```typescript\nconst base_url = 'https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/';\nlet common_params = '?format=geojson';\ncommon_params += '&starttime=2017-07-01&endtime=2017-07-31';\nconst count_url = base_url + 'count' + common_params;\nconst query_url = base_url + 'query' + common_params;\nexport interface EarthQuake {\n  mag: number;\n  time: number;\n  place: string;\n}\n@Injectable()\nexport class EarthQuakeService {\nconstructor(private http: Http) {}\n\ncount(): Observable<number> {\n    return this.http.get(count_url).map(data => data.json()).map(\n        data => data['count']);\n}\n\nquery(limit = 10, offset = 1, orderby = 'time'): Observable<EarthQuake[]> {\n    let url = query_url;\n    url += `&orderby=${orderby}&limit=${limit}&offset=${offset}`;\n    return this.http.get(url).map(data => data.json()).map(\n        data => data['features'].map(feature => feature['properties']));\n}\n\n}\n```\nThe Angular component could look like this:\n```typescript\n@Component({\n    templateUrl: './quakes.component.html'\n})\nexport class EarthQuakesComponent implements OnInit {\ntotalRecords: number;\nloading = true;\nlimit = 10;\nrecords: EarthQuake[];\n\nconstructor(private quakeService: EarthQuakeService) { }\n\nngOnInit() {\n  this.quakeService.count().subscribe(\n    totalRecords => { this.totalRecords = totalRecords; }\n  );\n}\n\nloadRecords(event: LazyLoadEvent) {\n    let orderby = event.sortField;\n    if (orderby) {\n        if (orderby === 'mag') {\n            orderby = 'magnitude';\n        }\n        if (event.sortOrder > 0) {\n            orderby += '-asc';\n        }\n    } else {\n        orderby = '';\n    }\n    this.loading = true;\n    const limit = event.rows;\n    const offset = event.first + 1;\n    this.quakeService.query(\n    limit, offset, orderby).subscribe(\n      records => {\n        this.records = records;\n        this.loading = false;\n      });\n}\n\n}\n```\nYour template can be something like this:\n```html\nVirtual scroll through {{totalRecords}} earth quakes\n\n\n\n\n      {{row.time | date:'medium'}}\n    \n\n\n\n```. It's important that you pass the event.first, event.rows and sorting properly to your server side. similar to how I did it in the above example. Also note that there is now a new p-table component (aka \"TurboTable\") and p-dataTable is considered deprecated. If you care about performance, you should first switch to p-table.. Thank you for the quick response. I can confirm this resolves the issue.\nI should have read the docs more carefully, since they mention appendTo. But maybe you can add this as another use case in the docs, which currently recommend using appendTo only \"when the dialog includes other components with overlays\". The other use case would be that the dialog is inside a layout element which has its own stacking context.. Please reconsider, as the fix is very simple and obvious, does not need additional code, and makes horizontal layout work the same as vertical. Otherwise,  the fact that horizonzal trees have restrictions compared with vertical ones should be documented, because this is not what the user of the component expects.  In my view this is a bug since the layout attribute should only affect how things are displayed, not which things are displayed.\nOne use case for me is a button that allows users switching from horizontal to vertical layout mode. It is not acceptable that when switching the layout mode, suddenly whole branches are missing.\nAlso note that my fix does not change anything in the case that the tree only has one root.. This is sad because it is an extremely simple and straightforward fix in lines 335/336, that makes horizontal trees work the same as vertical trees (consistency is always a good thing). The diff only looks large because of whitespace changes (my editor stripped all the trailing whitespace).. I second that and am also willing to send a pull request.\nCurrently, p-autocomplete sets autocomplete=\"off\" but it should optionally also set autocorrect=\"off\" autocapitalize=\"off\" spellcheck=\"false\". A single switch for all of these should be sufficient.. @sunnyyadav100 we need a test case e.g. with stackblitz - for me it works with 7.1 rc. Hi @sunnyyadav100 thanks for the stackblitz. The current solution still has these two shortcomings:\n\n\nTo see the effect in your stackblitz, you must make the whole page very narrow, since you used the middle column f3. It works better with f5 or if you use fixed side top level table so that you can scroll horizontally. In the case of a very narrow page and a wide overlay, neither left nor right side tip might be appropriate - the tip would need to be moved to somewhere in the middle. The overlay component would have to adjust the tip position dynamically by changing the style instead of switching between two classes with the two given positions left and right. But the current solution is already much better than before where the tip only appeared on the left hand side.\n\n\nThe other problem is that the size of the overlay must be known beforehand because the tip position is miscalculated otherwise since the overlay is instantiated before we show it. In the stackblitz you have a table inside the overlay with a dynamic size. If you set a fixed width for the overlay or the table inside with [style]=\"{'width':'500px'}\" then everything should work properly. This can also happen when you are loading images in the overlay, and the images don't have a width set in their img tag or style. This can also cause the \"works only on second click\" effect (on the first click, the image size is still unknown - on the second click, the images are already loaded and their size is known). You can see this in the overlay demo shipped with PrimeNG, if you put the button on the right side. It only works when you give the images a fixed width. I have done that in 56e62b70d7ddba42ad409f5cd9a90db661db57df to show how overlaypanel works on the right-hand side (where you usually put your buttons). Unfortunately in 014af32b72b9d7b0596b69eb63901b73b7d14dcf the buttons were moved back again to the left hand side, so the demo can't be used to show the right-side tips any more.\n\n\n. ",

I had the same issue. This is in the documentation although to be fair it's not very clear. \nUnder Overlays in Cells\n```\nCells of datatable hides the overflow by default, this prevents \noverlay of a component like dropdown to be displayed properly. \nIn cases like these, set the style of the column to allow overflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nIf you were to hover the dropdown in Dev Tools on Chrome, you would see it's present but doing z-index didn't solve anything. Doing the above fixed the issue for me. It's annoying to add it to every for column manually. Is there a reason this isn't done by default @cagataycivici ?. In the documentation, as stated in Overlays Inside,you're supposed to do this\n<p-dialog [contentStyle]=\"{'overflow':'visible'}\">\n    <p-dropdown></p-dropdown>\n</p-dialog>. ",

Therefore it would be nice to have a built-in solution for this.. @alexschilpp this is my expectation exactly. I just commented on #3611 since that issue is still open and might hopefully be resolved.. Looking at the source code for the calendar component, this is all the UTC property does:\nif(this.utc)\n    date = new Date(Date.UTC(dateMeta.year, dateMeta.month, dateMeta.day));\nelse\n    date = new Date(dateMeta.year, dateMeta.month, dateMeta.day);\nIt creates a local Date object based on the UTC values for the year, month, and day you selected. So when you select a day (e.g. August 25), the component says \"oh, you want the local date for 2017-08-25T00:00:00Z\". I'm in EDT right now, so selecting the 25th renders Thu Aug 24 2017 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT), and that's what is displayed in the control.\nI was hoping that enabling UTC would allow the component to accept a UTC date input and then output the UTC date value in the control.. To be fair, I have since discovered that displaying a formatted date specific to a timezone won't be possible until Angular v5: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9324\nIt looks like he got his PR done though and it's ready to be merged: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/18284. So hopefully PrimeNG will build this capability into their calendar component when the time comes.. @cagataycivici unfortunately p-table still seems to have this issue: http://plnkr.co/edit/D0eue9uk0o58kWLDBIGO?p=preview.

Appreciate all your efforts working on this project, I know it must be a lot of work. \nQuick question around the 1000+ rows performance impact: Do you know if there something fundamentally different about some of the other Angular grids that do seem to be able to handle a lot more data? E.g. if you look at http://demos.wijmo.com/5/angular/benchmark/benchmark/#/flexgrid you can load 1 million rows into some of the grids seemingly without any significant performance penalty.. The only edit event that seems to work as per the documentation is OnEditInit, can anyone comment on whether these will be fixed?\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/1FnDcOcK3YChNjdvTT8A\n. Would including the original native event in the PrimeNG event work? So then stopPropagation() or preventDefault() could then be called on the native event.. Originally I was only thinking of preventing the browser event, for example, so that the focus could be forced to remain on a field where invalid data had been entered. I'd not considered whether the ngModel binding needed to be prevented, but being able to prevent the ngModel write sounds good.. Apologies, the code in the Plunk was indeed incorrect.. Seems to still exist as of 4.1.0-rc2 and Angular 4.2.4\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/1QP10X0DL8Zs1HcW4rl9?p=preview. ",

Here is my more angular like workaround which always jumps to the first page but could also be adjusted (in my case first page is fine)\nTypescript\n  @ViewChild(Table)\n  private table: Table;\ntypescript\n    // after data change\n    if (this.table) {\n      this.table.first = 0; // go to desired page\n    }.

That means you need to initialize selection input model from the same objects you provide as value input to p-tree component.\nIf you want to select parent with only some children, then children should have parent property pointing to a parent node, which should have partialSelected = true.\nHope I was clear enough :). If not, use augury extension or just debugging to see how selection model changes when you check/uncheck nodes and initialize them accordingly.. I was looking at the source code and there actually is UTC date when you pick a date from calendar. But there is local date when you update it manually via input. This should be fixed to be consistent.... I believe the problem is, that you change time portion inside existing date object and angular doesn't detect this change.

It's always better to provide the solution when a ticket is closed.\nAnyway.  I could solve it by adding  appendTo=\"body\" to my dropdown.. I'm a big fan of KatzeKahn's proposal.

I tested your version and I see at least 1 blocking issue.\nThe enter key only seems to work in Chrome.

Each time you click the input field the focus is set to the calendar widget.\nI think it would be better to only do an auto-focus in case the input field is read only or the calendar is opened with the button.. +1.  This issue should be open as error messages that apply to basic mode should always be displayed or at least one of the callbacks should be called so that we can interact with it.. It's a very easy fix but I don't have the time to create a pull request for it.  This is how to fix it:\nupdateColorSelector () {\n        let bgValue = {};\n        bgValue.s = 100;\n        bgValue.b = 100;\n        bgValue.h = this.value.h;\n        this.colorSelectorViewChild.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = '#' + this.HSBtoHEX(bgValue);\n    };. There's a workaround.  You could do something like this\n[pTooltip]=\"showTooltip('Remote View')\"\nWhere showTooltip returns null in case it's a mobile browser.\nBut I totally agree to disable button tooltips on mobile safari as I can't think of any case where a tooltip is useful on a (toggle)button.. For those wanting to combine FA 4 and 5 icons on older versions of PrimeNG, there's a very simple trick to support both.\nAdd following rules to your css file (don't forget to first add FA 5 support to your application):\n/* font awesome 5 */\n.fa.fab, .fa.fal, .fa.far, .fa.fas {\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-variant: normal;\n  text-rendering: auto;\n  line-height: 1;\n}\n.fa.fas {\n  font-family: Font Awesome\\ 5 Free;\n  font-weight: 900;\n}\n.fa.far {\n  font-family: Font Awesome\\ 5 Free;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\nIf you want to use a FA 5 icon you only need to prefix it with 'fas ' or 'far ' anywhere PrimenNG supports setting a FA icon.\nex. <p-confirmDialog icon=\"fas fa-question-circle\"></p-confirmDialog>. I totally agree with @JBusch \nThe problem with p-Dialog is that it just behaves as a display: block/none at this moment.  So it is only really useful for static content.  But it's not clear from the documentation that this is what a developer should expect from it.\nIt would be nice if the documentation is updated to warn developers about this behaviour.\nAt the same time it might be wise to have a look at the implementation of the dialog in Angular Material:\nhttps://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview\nTheir dialog implementation works as any developer would expect.  The component you pass as content is only initialized when showing the dialog and destroyed when hiding the dialog.  This way you can easily reuse components without having to implement all sorts of lifecycle hooks to get the same behaviour.  At the same time it also fixes the animation behaviour that is mentioned in another ticket.\nI really like PrimeNG.  It's a multitude of times better than Angular Material.  But the dialog component at this moment really sucks. (sorry for the language)\n. This one might be related:\nWhen an Overlay Panel contains an inline ColorPicker, the ColorPicker disappears when clicking outside the Overlay Panel (it's actually visible to the naked eye that the dom of the ColorPicker gets removed before the Overlay Panel disappears).  Showing the Overlay Panel a second time only renders the bare skeleton of the ColorPicker.  I guess that ColorPicker itself contains an Overlay Panel and that this nesting is not correctly handled.  Maybe this is also happening in the other use cases mentioned in this ticket.\nEDIT: the same behaviour when adding an inline ColorPicker to a Dialog.. I'm more and more convinced that all these issues are related.  The problem seems to be related to the animations.  When the animation to hide the Overlay runs, the animation to hide the Color Picker also runs.  It creates a nice effect so I'm in favor of keeping it. \nBut when the Overlay is displayed again, the animation of the Color Picker doesn't run anymore and so it is only partially rendered.  I think that the same happens with other components that have animations like the Accordion.\nI could easily see this behavior by setting breakpoints on the onOverlayAnimationStart methods of the different components involved.. Stumbled across this open issue on Angular:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20823\nApparently when nesting animations the child animation does not trigger automatically.  You need to trigger it from inside the parent animation.  In the case of the calendar it means that the opacity remains '0' and so the calendar is not visible the second time.\nI'm pretty sure now that the issues mentioned by Kirk and the one I noticed are related.. Aha!  I think I found the solution.  The problem seems to be the names of the states.  Both OverlayPanel as ColorPicker are using 'void' and 'visible' as animation state names.  By means of a test I modified the ones of ColorPicker to 'void2' and 'visible2' and now everything works fine in both inline as popup mode.\nI've seen that Accordion also uses the name 'visible' but does not use 'void' (it uses 'hidden').  I think that's the reason why part of the Accordion becomes visible when the overlay becomes visible.\nSo I guess that all animation states should be reviewed and made unique.  (How to do this for nested components of the same type might be a challenge). It could indeed be a bug in Angular already introduced in Version 5.\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20811\n. I agree because I don't think that this issue will be fixed any time soon in Angular.  I think that it's an undocumented behaviour of the Animations library.  I've read in the documentation that the whole idea of their Animation library is to allow for complex nested animations.  The problem seems to be that nobody actual succeeds in doing so :-)\n. ",

However, I do not see any commits around this issue. It will be great to know if there has been any development around this topic on your side. Do you have any plans about when this feature may be available.\nIf there isn't any committed plan for this, I will be highly thankful to know any possible workaround for now.\nThanks once again for feature component set.

I just want to say that this change alone has caused us to abandon PrimeNG and cancel our plans for PrimeNG premium services (we're a mid sized software company in the states).\nYou can't make a framework for business/enterprise and then change things like this with no warning, proper documentation, and debate in your community. \nWe built a huge chunk of our app in the 2.* versions of PrimeNG and have a huge amount of code that relies on the previous method of change detection. Then this change is made in an RC release with a tiny side note and our entire application breaks when we upgrade.\nWe can't have people deciding to make major BREAKING changes frequently based off their own personal preferences. We'll likely fork the repo for now until we can fully replace this suite with something more appropriate. . ",

Is there another way to do this?\nHere is a plunker to reproduce: http://plnkr.co/edit/2WMrT6euFd8WWzciKBrZ\n. I have modified the way I reset the events and the infinite loop is gone: http://plnkr.co/edit/rbJxyvAU3Sxw4BHpiZwA. @jacqueslareau instead of reinitializing the events array, I have removed the elements from it:\n```javascript\nexport class AppComponent {\n  events: any[]=[];\nloadEvents(event) {\n    console.log(event);\n    this.events.splice(0, this.events.length);\n    this.events.push({\n      start: \"2017-03-20\",\n      end: \"2017-03-21\",\n    });\n  }\n}\n```.

I really would appreciate this feature too.\nWhen we have a lot of options, the application is like frozen until they're completely loaded which is not great.. I can hear your solution, but it's not really the best one in my case...\nEvery time I change the selected option of the dropdown, I filter a p-datatable.\nWith your solution I'd have to put the same code on the onChange and in the clear method.\nI have multiple dropdowns in the page and the case will be reproduced in my application, so every time I will be in this situation I'll have to do the same calls twice (on the onChange and on the clear)...\nA solution would be to watch changes on the ngModel and execute the filtering at this time instead of doing it on the onChange event...\nNot the solution I prefer .... This is kind of what I did...\nTo have this behavior everywhere I need I made a component with the p-dropdown and a \"clear button\".\nWhen I click on the \"clear button\", I update the selected option with null and  I fire programmatically  the onChange event otherwise (what was very important in my case because I have an Ajax call on this event).\n.

Probably related to https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/2307. The InputText directive uses similar code: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/master/components/inputtext/inputtext.ts#L11. This demo seems to work for me (Chrome and desktop Safari): https://plnkr.co/edit/pHI0BtXHsmbEj97qdnPY?p=preview. Both textareas work - the one with ngModel and the one without. Typing in the empty sets the ui-state-filled and deleting removes it. Does this one work for you?. Also this is a demo which fails immediately when I test in Chrome and desktop Safari: https://plnkr.co/edit/wKUETJ?p=preview\nIf ngDoCheck does not work alone I suggest we use the input event instead of blur. The former fires more often and would lead to immediate change. Unfortunately I see the opposite behavior than you - ngDoCheck seems to work fine in the \"working\" demo.. Sorry about that :(. Do you mean in the attributes section in the demo pages? I can do that.. Done!. Sorry, didn't find it in the docs. How about https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/4706? It kind of works and at least there is no runtime exception.. Any feedback on this PR? I am willing to do whatever it takes to get it merged. . The same occurs if the component is inside an HTML element with overflow: auto - the dropdown is clipped. Please either set appendTo=\"body\" or expose it in the paginator and DataTable components.. FWIW here is an ugly workaround which mitigates the problem to some extent:\n.ui-paginator .ui-dropdown-panel {\n  position: fixed;\n  left: auto !important;\n  top: auto !important;\n  min-width: auto !important;\n  display: block !important;\n}\nOf course this makes the dropdown fixed - if the user scrolls the page the dropdown will remain fixed..

The comparision should rather be so:\nvalidMin = !this.minDate || this.minDate <= selectedDate;\nvalidMax = !this.maxDate || this.maxDate => selectedDate;. I don't agree with you. Independently if it's a custom element, you should follow the general approach to decorate the input elements with those classes as well. Since I (and probably others) don't use your stylesheets, it requires us to write separate CSS rules.. On desktop devices, I would definitely NOT prefer such an approach. A better solution would be to navigate through each block (day, month, year, hour, minutes) by using the tab + the left/right arrow keys and then adjust the date block with the up/down arrow keys (including modulo operations). Currently, this feature is still missing.\nAnd even on mobiles devices I would NOT separate the blocks. Instead, take iOS as an example and provide a picker panel to easily select your values with the finger.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/pickers/. Similar problem here: In my case, the InputMask gets initialized with the ngModel-value without any problem but the onComplete-Event is NOT triggered initially. :(. Any updates on that?. Why do you close it? The sense of an input mask is to prevent incorrect user inputs. This also includes checking the mask being completed. I understand completeness must not be mandatory (e.g. license tags can be different: \"A-BB1234\" vs. \"A-BB12\").\nBUT, there are clear uses cases where completeness is crucial like credit card numbers or the IBAN. A good solution would be to add an @Input to make completeness check controllable.. Some additional notes on that issue:\nI experienced the following buggy behavior: For example, you set minDate to\"10h:00m\" (defaultTime set to the same).\n\nclicking on the calendar the time field appears with \"10:00\" (good)\nclicking on the hour arrow down, nothing happens because minDate == defaultTime (good)\nthen clicking hour arrow up, it increments the hour correctly (good)\nbut when it comes to the next step after '23:00', it sets '00:00' (bad, '23:00' should be the last step)\nif hour time is wrongly '00:00' now, it's not possible to decrement the time again, it stays at '00:00' when clicking the hour arrow down again (bad)\n\nI just explained for hours but I assume the issue also occurs for minutes and millseconds arrows.\nI'm using PrimeNG version: primeng@5.2.0 on Chrome.

    "machfalcon": "We have a need to display a filter dropdown from the header of a table while using resizeble columns and a scrollable table.  Hoping this usage can also be handled in the next version.. Looks like there's an issue with this fix if the data doesn't change when the lazy load event is fired.  In our usage, we are ignoring the lazy load event on horizontal scroll since we are loading the full row up front and not lazy loading any column data.  However, since handleDataChange isn't called since we aren't changing the data, the table still displays the loading spinner and we can't set it back to not loading unless we do some workaround such as:\nthis.data = [...this.data];. Looks like the scroll event is firing when it shouldn't which is causing the table to continuously scroll down when the first lazyLoad event is fired.  There are a couple of issues that seem to be causing this:\n\n\nScrollableView.prototype.ngAfterViewChecked - the call to this.alignScrollBar() causes the scroll event to trigger which causes this.bodyScrollListener to fire.  The issue might be in the alignScrollBar() function or the bodyScrollListener function.\n\n\nDataTable.prototype.ngAfterViewChecked - the last line in the second if block looks like it should be setting this.totalRecordsChanged = false otherwise that block of code will re-execute every time ngAfterViewChecked is fired.. I also need this ability.  It seems like the way the columns and column templates are pulled in through @ContentChildren does not allow extending the datatable (as far as I can tell, Angular doesn't seem to be passing the @ContentChildren through to the extended component).  Would it be possible to pass the columns and column templates as inputs so that my extended datatable can pass them in?.

It appears that any form controls inside ng-template tags lose the ability to handle the same keyboard events for ENTER and TAB that the normal input elements not inside template tags currently enjoy.. @cagataycivici: could you please provide a code snippet example on how to call closeCell()? \nI'm attempting to call it on blur but getting \"ERROR TypeError: co.closeCell is not a function\"\nExample template code:\n<ng-template *ngIf=\"col.editable\" let-valcode=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"editor\">\n    <input type=\"text\" pInputText [(ngModel)]=\"valcode[col.field]\" (blur)=\"closeCell();\" />\n</ng-template>. Thank you @agusdutra, that was the piece I was missing! I just had to add the \"p-\" prefix to the dataTable tag name in your example.. By the way, the new primeng 4.0-RC3 greatly improves the tabbing behavior when inside editable datatable cells. My simple example above actually gets in the way of the latest UI improvements, so instead I'm calling a separate method to decide if calling dataTable.closeCell() is even appropriate.

I just a little while ago realized I was on the 4.0.0-rc.3 not the latest.  I just upgraded to 4.1.0 and it works fine for me now.. From my description above:\n\"The work around involves maintaining a map of objects and then getting the id value string from the dropdown an then translating that back and forth to the object/id\". Yes, I see thanks very much.. I'm using PrimeNG version: primeng@5.2.6 on Chrome\nI have also noted weird behavior with the time controls when setting minDate on a p-calendar.  Not 100% sure it's related to this issue, but I will note my issue here as well.  I am working on creating a plunk to reproduce it, but was having some issues getting the plunk to work.  Once I get that working I will submit a more detailed report, but here's what I am seeing.  \nIn our use case we have two p-calendar controls to represent a start and end date.  At the component init, the bound variable set to minDate for the start date p-calendar is set to the current date/time and the one for minDate for the end date p-calendar is set to current date/time plus one day.\nOn changing the value of the start date, we update the bound variable set to minDate for the end date control to be the current start date plus one day.\nIf you then try to interact with the time controls on the end date p-calendar control we have weird behavior similar to what's reported above but I have also seen other things intermittently like the time controls being all greyed out and not responding to clicks, but then randomly responding to clicks despite still being greyed out.  Sometimes some are greyed out but others not. I have also seen the hour change to 24hr format randomly while clicking the minutes and also have seen the calendar increment the selected day as I incremented the minutes up or down.\nSo far the only thing that seems to stop this weird behavior is if I stop updating minDate on the end date control dynamically when the start date value changes.. We just ran into this as we upgraded to Primeng 5.2.3 while still on Angular 4.2 in order to get some newer functionality with p-dropdown.  Where does Primeng list what versions of Angular their releases work with?  The NPM page doesn't mention version dependencies with Angular.. ",

    "malhar12": "@ctrl-brk @cagataycivici - I have made a directive, that does this exact job. Detects, if contents of cell are overflowing, if so, then adds ellipsis to it, and it also works with primeng tooltip. But, I am a bit confused on the process of contributing, as it is not very clear. Like do I add it to showcase with my changes and just raise a PR?. I made the directive per column as opposed to per table. I believe, having it per column is more efficient as compared to the table, because then, it would go and check contents of every cell for overflow. Efficient in terms of less DOM traversing to the cells. Usually, the scenarios that I have commonly observed, are that, not all the columns will contain data that overflows.. If this is supposed to work with the primeng tooltip, we would have to apply the tooltips to each column anyway, because the primeng tooltip cannot be triggered from the code, since it is declarative in nature. So,we might just add the directive to the column as well.. @ctrl-brk  @kenisteward @cagataycivici @dagyrox @dhniels \nFollowing is my approach to the Overflow ellipsis problem.

Would really appreciate it if you do.. A work-around I just found... It's not ideal, but it could help... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40751383/angular-universal-dynamic-imports-for-browser-only. @dockleryxk Actually yes. I did manage, thankfully! :)\nI'm going to setup a primeng-mock module eventually so other people with this issue can just reference that for assistance with the issue, but essentially here is what I needed to do:\nFirstly, import IsBrowser from angular2-universal\nimport { isBrowser } from 'angular2-universal';\nThis will be used in an \"if\" statement later to either import the actual primeng module or to import a mock module which you will need to create.\nWhat you will want to do next is in your file where you create your @NgModule component for your project you will want to take your \"imports\" object and set it up as an array which will later be assigned to your @NgModule\nNext: I created an AbstractMock class as the contents of it will need to be extended into all of your mock modules. This is how the AbstractMock class looks:\n```\nimport { ControlValueAccessor } from '@angular/forms';\nexport abstract class AbstractMock implements ControlValueAccessor {\n    private innerValue: any = '';\nprivate onTouchedCallback: () => void = () => { };\nprivate onChangeCallback: (_: any) => void = () => { };\n\nwriteValue(value: any) {\n    if (value !== this.innerValue) {\n        this.innerValue = value;\n    }\n}\n\nregisterOnChange(fn: any) {\n    this.onChangeCallback = fn;\n}\n\nregisterOnTouched(fn: any) {\n    this.onTouchedCallback = fn;\n}\n\n}\n```\nNext: create a mock module for one of the components you are using. For help here I will show the code for a pretty simple and small one. Here is my code for a mock of the Dropdown module:\n```\nimport { Component, forwardRef, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { AbstractMock } from \"./abstract-mock\";\nexport const CUSTOM_INPUT_CONTROL_VALUE_ACCESSOR: any = {\n    provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\n    useExisting: forwardRef(() => DropdownModuleMock),\n    multi: true\n};\n@Component({\n    selector: 'p-dropdown',\n    template: 'loading...',\n    providers: [CUSTOM_INPUT_CONTROL_VALUE_ACCESSOR]\n})\nexport class DropdownModuleMock extends AbstractMock {\n    @Input() filter: boolean;\n    @Input() options: any[];\n    @Input() editable: boolean;\n    @Input() autoWidth: boolean;\n    @Input() style: string;\n    @Input() styleClass: string;\n    @Input() placeholder: string;\n    @Output() onChange: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n}\n```\nNote You would need to create an Input\\Output property for every attribute your code is referencing. You could add for everything Primeng caters for, but they have so many that I only focused on what I'm actually using...\nNow that you have those basics setup you will need to import it into your application.\nHere is an example of how that would look:\n```\n// Create imports array object which will contain all modules to be imported into your application\nlet imports = [\n    UniversalModule, \n    RouterModule.forRoot(AppRoutes),\n    FormsModule,\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\n];\n// Add either PrimeNg module or Mock Module to the import array based on whether the code is being run in the browser or from the server\nif (isBrowser) {\n    let DropdownModule = require('primeng/components/dropdown/dropdown').DropdownModule;\nimports.push(DropdownModule);\n\n}\nelse {\n    let DropdownModuleMock = require('./components/primeng-mocks/dropdown-mock.component').DropdownModuleMock;\nAppDeclerations.push(DataTableColumnMock); // **Quick note about this**: Because the mock module isn't a proper module it must rather be declared as a component as opposed to imported as a module. In this case, I have an 'AppDeclerations' array that houses all of my declerations.\n\n}\n// Then setup your application with your setup and get going\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n    declarations: AppDeclerations,\n    imports: imports,\n    providers: AppProviders\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nHope this can help you :)\nEDIT: I'm really bad with GitHub markup, so hopefully it looks better this time.... @strings28 I have a theory about their Angular 4 and Angular 2 versions being so vastly different... From what I could tell from a brief look (so I could very well be wrong) is that their Angular 4 version is built in Typescript and Angular 2 is actually just straight up javascript with Typescript Typings, so that's why its JS is so dependent on browser-related objects (window/document/etc...) being available...\nThis is, however, an assumption on my part.... @dockleryxk Awesome! Will definitely keep this in mind eventually when I upgrade my project to Angular 4. Thanks. ",

I had a few tables working with customSort but when I upgraded I started to see the same error as you.\nIs there anyworkaround ?. Your workaround is indeed working, but I noticed the paginator stops working as soon as I follow your method. Seems that I'll have to either wait or downgrade to a rc version.\nI hope the primeng team is aware of this bug. Adding sortMode=\"multiple\" does fix the paginator, however I can't get it to enter the actual custom sort function when I added that. It seems it was using the default sorting function no matter the declaration.\nIn my case I'm sorting dates (dd/mm/yyyy format) and that column is the only one with a custom sorting function declaration. When I try to order it, it goes smooth but breaks the paginator. If I add sortMode=multiple, the paginator works but my function is no longer called.\nI guess we're still kinda stuck. @omkarmjoshi thanks for your suggestion!. I hadn't thought of it. Fortunately, one of the following updates (iirc 4.0.1) fixed the paginator going crazy and by adding sortMode=multiple did solve the main sorting issue. The same approach works for 4.0.2 btw.\n. @1uc4 My bad. Upon further inspection, the custom sort mode was not being called (when using sortMode=multiple). But, when I used sortMode=Single or just avoided the sortMode attribute, the function was indeed being accessed. However, the rows star to break and the rows \"order\" themselves when you hover the mouse. Really weird behavior. \n(Nice profile pic btw).\nAccording to the last post update from primeng team (4.0.2), they were planning to release 4.03 with mainly bug fixes in 2 weeks. Hope this bug can make it there.\n. Even in the plunkr the function is not being called.  (2nd table).\nI deleted the function and it didn't complain at all and the sorting was still viable (it uses primeng internal sorting function).. Turns out I didn't declare [sortMode] but sortMode. \nNow everything works properly :). ",

That exposes the erroneous behavior as follows:\n\nStandard sorting: When clicking on a table header, the table UI gets updated. But upon pressing keyup/keydown, a seemingly random element is selected in the UI --> I conclude: The displayed list in the UI is sorted, but not the array backing it. Thus, the positions and therefore the element indices of the UI list and the backing array diverge.\nCustom sorting: In the UI, nothing happens upon clicking the table header. But when navigating with the keyboard, also a seemingly random element is chosen. --> I conclude: The behavior is exactly inverse as in the standard case: The backing array is sorted correctly, but the UI is not updated accordingly.\n\nI hope I've made myself clear..

I can't remember as it was over 3 months ago... but the bug doesn't exist when using reactive forms, only with value/ngModel binding. Also I think the  @Optional() was, because the NgModel injection only works when unsing ngModel binding. So for reactive forms it should be undefined, as it is with the [value] binding and so it shouldn't break it.. @cagataycivici What is your problem with this PR? Why does it take over 6 months now to get this reviewed/merged? The uuuuultra slow response time doesnt really encourage us to buy another premium template for the next project :/. I know that the solution isn't pretty, but I spent a whole day to find a better solution and didn't find any... so is it better to what for a solution that may never come, than to fix this bug already and releave us and maybe others from all the workarounds for this bug that clutter our codebase?.

I think a quick bit of styling or more consistent HTML across components should be considered to help this, as Bootstrap is so common.\nBootstrap applies bold to the Label element, and MultiSelect doesn't override this in it's own CSS classes. Other controls (well, DropDown, atleast) do specify the font weight in the .ui-dropdown .ui-dropdown-label and .normal.ui-inputtext classes. Also, DropDown doesn't use the Label element in it's list items, so there is an inconsistency between the two which could probably be resolved for more consistent styling.\n(BTW, 'font-weight' in the Style property doesn't seem to work for MultiSelect, although other style options do. )\nThe following CSS counters the Bootstrap label styling which causes the inconsistency, specifically for the multiselect component:\nlabel.ui-multiselect-label.ui-corner-all {\n    font-weight: normal;\n    margin-bottom: auto;\n  }\nli.ui-multiselect-item.ui-corner-all label {\n  font-weight: normal;\n  margin-bottom: auto;\n}\nThis might be worth adding to the project?.

Our current work around is setting [escape]=\"false\".. I don't know if this will be of any help, but I did something similar to this in a project for the sake of loading dynamic components.   I used @ViewChildren over the dynamic components and watched for changes.  Here's a plunkr with dates.. I played with your plunkr, and changed ngOnit() to ngOnInit() and it worked fine.  Hopefully that works for you as well.. @ericrovtar that's a good one to have in the quiver, thanks.\nngAfterViewInit has saved me with dynamic content a couple times, recently with tabViews.  Since we're sharing, here's a very simplified version of that.. @cagataycivici The fix put in place does not account for zeros.

Well, you do actually, because using styleClass you'll be giving the p-column attribute the class you chose, meaning that the  tag will be the one having the class. Just as the image below:\n\n\nAnd the style is not setting the class in any element that I choose. So I'm having a bad time because of this. And since (mouseover) or (mouseenter) doesn't work on the p-dataTable or p-column you can see where I'm getting at. And using tr:hover or anything like that at the local scss doesn't work.\nIf any of you have any other suggestion that I should try, please, do suggest.. I was able to use the rowStyleClass and then use a certain style at every row. And then using what @dzhavat showed at codepen I was able to to in part what I wanted. Still, definitely not the best way of using it.. @dzhavat Because when you place the styleClass on the dataTable, the tag that gets the css class is the , so I suppose it won't work if I try to access a class that's inner than  and then invoke  after in css. Or am I mistaken?. @dzhavat Well, that's some nice example there, and now I get what you meant. Thank you very much!. @wz2b Yeah, I found that out by looking inside PrimeNG code and some stuff wasn't really making any sense, that's how I figured it out.\nBut I wish I had the time to go back to it and make this change.

In my case i filtered the list locally So the problem appear.\nworking example with local filter: http://plnkr.co/edit/PRpdP6wF9Qv291Q5OExw?p=preview. thanks. i will try that out really soon.. after few day of work, i finally found i way to unlock this feature and seems to work even if all my columns have fixed style.\n<p-dataTable` [value]=\"list\"  ... #dt>\n <p-column field=\"normalField1\" [style]=\"{'width': '200px'}\" filterPlaceholder=\"2\"></p-column>\n <p-column field=\"normalField2\"  [style]=\"{'width': '200px'}\" filterPlaceholder=\"3\"></p-column>\n <p-column field=\"normalField3\"  [style]=\"{'width': '200px'}\" filterPlaceholder=\"1\">\n      <ng-template let-car=\"rowData\" pTemplate=\"body\">\n            <button type=\"button\" pButton (click)=\"selectCar(car)\" icon=\"fa-search\"></button>\n       </ng-template>\n </p-column>\n</p-dataTable>\nfor ( let element1 in this.dataTable.columns ) {\n                for ( let element2 in this.dataTable.columns ) {\n                    if ( (+this.dataTable.columns[element1].filterPlaceholder) < (+this.dataTable.columns[element2].filterPlaceholder) ){\n                        let temp = this.dataTable.columns[element1];\n                        this.dataTable.columns[element1] = this.dataTable.columns[element2];\n                        this.dataTable.columns[element2] = temp;\n                    }\n                }\n            };. this is a short video of the final result. :)\nhttps://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cbQFjGIqkn\n. Same for me. In 4.1.3 is working.. The Global filter work to me. You are passing always the same array so you cant see any change.\nI forked your example and now work. \nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/7ep1mkxmn9E8HnGOnIzh?p=preview. It basically the same just make your server call in the getAgencies() method and update this.records after you get your data. The datatable will be update with the new values.. i dont really know. Just write [resizableColumns]=\"false\". . ",

After checking the code of dataTable the hooks weren't emitted at the useful level.

As far as I remember: In the Component I created a stub data item of the real expected lazy data type and initialized the datatable's rows with an array holding that item. That way the first row-height calculation is based upon the stub instead of 'No records found' text. The downside is that the stub item is visible until the real data is loaded.\nFYI: In the newer version you actually have to move to TurboTable instead of Datatable, maybe it's fixed there.. ",

After updating the Plunkr so that is uses PrimeNG 4.2.2, the dropdown works just fine without any further adjustments to your code :)\nFor the record: in PrimeNG version 4.1.X you had to call a separate event \"onDropdownClick\".. @cagataycivici, your code is not triggering the bug because the bug-causing attribute is not present...\nMy previous Plunkr was on 4.3.0 (checked it in \"systemjs.config.js\": 'primeng': 'npm:primeng@4.3.0' to be sure). Anyways, I created a new Plunkr based on the given URL:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/KHw1AJ5legYuFXAcsR6I?p=preview\n<span class=\"ui-float-label\">\n  <p-autoComplete id=\"foo\" [suggestions]=\"resultsFilter\" (completeMethod)=\"search($event)\" \n            [dropdown]=\"true\">\n    <ng-template let-resultItems>\n      <div class=\"ui-helper-clearfix\">\n        <div>{{resultItems}}</div>\n      </div>\n    </ng-template>\n  </p-autoComplete>\n  <label for=\"foo\">Never keep floating</label>\n</span>\nIt is NOT working.... your example is NOT using the [dropdown]=\"true\"... if you read the case-description thorough, you'll see that I stated: \n\nthe floating-labels are not floating after selecting an item in the dropdownlist, when the dropdown is triggered by the MouseEvent\n. @cagataycivici could you please check this out again?. @cagataycivici I can conform it's fixed using PrimeNG5!!\nThank you very much for this quick fix!. @ccasallas, I also created a separate issue: #4319, with a plunkr case. The plunkr case confirms that the current behaviour is not limited to Ultima, it uses Omega and still behaves the same way.... Bug report or new feature request is the only difference :). @ccasallas using Ultima, I got the datepicker working with floating labels out-of-the-box. Can't prove it right now (mobile and all that), but I'll get back to this asap.. @ccasallas alright, so I got it working with a simple date-component. Codewise, in Ultima, it's the same as any <input> with a floating label, but instead of using <input> you just have to use the calendar-selector <p-calendar>.\nPlunkr is failing me at the moment, so have a GIF as proof :)\n\n\nThe template-code:\n<span class=\"md-inputfield\">\n<p-calendar showIcon=\"true\" id=\"someDate\"></p-calendar>\n<label for=\"someDate\">Have a label</label>\n</span>\n.

No, but you can fork PrimeNG , and open it as a project. Then, you should follow the directions in  our Wiki  page. While you are cloning do not forget to write your username instead of primafaces (e.g. crtl-brk/primeng instead of primefaces/primeng)\nYou can do lots of trials about all of primeng components there.. Dear @paulswan \nDid you look at PrimeNG's awesome grid CSS which includes vital features as nested or responsive positioning?\nhttps://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/grid\nHere, you can partition your screen as you want and align right or left each of your elements separately.. You can partition your row by using grid class in a div such as:\n<div class=\"ui-g\">\n    <div class=\"ui-g-6\"></div>\n    <div class=\"ui-g-6\">\n        <p-dataTable #dt [value]=\"cars\">\n              <p-column field=\"vin\" header=\"Vin\"></p-column>\n               <p-column field=\"year\" header=\"Year\"></p-column>\n               <p-column field=\"brand\" header=\"Brand\"></p-column>\n               <p-column field=\"color\" header=\"Color\"></p-column>\n         </p-dataTable>\n   </div>\n</div>\nHere, we partitioned the screen into two part (by 12/6) and then used the second part.\nThis is the simplest illustration. If you try something for yourself, I am sure you will cover this situation better.. In IE version 11.0.25, X button works fine and clears the value when it is clicked on.. Hello,\nActually, tree table has lazy loading property. Didn't it satisfy your project? Could you please explain your request more?\n. Hello, \nActually onClick() would be unnecessary for select button.  As you can see the code which quoted from \nPrimeNG-SelectButton page, the options which are clicked on are stored in selectedTypes array.\n<h3>Multiple</h3>\n<p-selectButton [options]=\"types\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedTypes\" multiple=\"multiple\"></p-selectButton>\n<p>Selected Types: <span *ngFor=\"let type of selectedTypes\">{{type}} </span></p>\nHowever, if you would like to do something with those selected variables, you can add a normal button and use its onClick() event. . Hello,\nI had the same issue with you. Then, I have realized that we should bind immutable  with brackets.\nHere you can see the related part : \n<p-growl [immutable] =\"false\" life =\"1000\" [(value)]=\"msgs\"></p-growl>\nmsgs is a Message object that you can examine in PrimeNG-growl page.\nFinally, dismissing worked fine in my project. Could you please share your related html code ?. Hi again,\nSorry, but I don't understand. Did it work or not?. Hello,\nCould you please share more of your code?  You can upload it to plunkr and provide us its link.\n. In p-calendar tag, you should provide a [(ngModel)] = \"value(date variable)\"  which holds the date value and displays it when showTime is true. In your situation, you are allowing and forbidding displaying showTime while there is no date value provided inside your p-calendar tag. \nPlease have a look at : https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/calendar. I think you should try to use ngModel in  p-calendar tag. Its being empty can cause some NaN values(which can be a boolean value ).. Actually, if you opened PrimeNG in your IDE(like ATOM) as a project, you can see the CSS classes  in those paths : \n'assets/showcase/css/primeng.css'\n'assets/showcase/css/code.css'\n'assets/showcase/css/site.css'\nDisplaying all classes in theming page would be so messy in terms of the crowd of the classes.\nIf you would like to learn how to use PrimeNG, try to use components (datatable, button , contextmenu etc.). You don't need to study on CSS classes at the beginning. Try to do a simple app such as Todo List with PrimeNG components. . If you insist on examining the CSS classes you can found them here:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/tree/master/src/assets/showcase/css. Dear kc13greiner,\nI got what you meant but it makes the page so messy that sharing styles of all components.

I was able to make a very hacked solution by directly editing the dom to make the normal rows look like groups.  It would be much cleaner to have the datatable be able to handle this directly.   . I've run into this same issue.  I can't speak to if this really is a \"bug\" or not but you can get around this by using the dataKey input property on the primeNG datatable.  This will do the selection on the dataKey and not the content of the rows.  \nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/te8mSK0U1NnBoj4U0xOH?p=preview\nThe way the datatable works without the key is that it does a selection check on the objects and if all the properties of the object are the same it selects the row as the same object.  I am not sure how they get around that unless they do a different object check or something like that.     .

Any updates?\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/CoSqvdoZkVnA4vDpSMWD?p=preview. We could make a video, but I don't think the issue is too hard to verify or a working solution too hard to test.. My understanding is that when datatable makes a call to lazyload at a scroll location, it first makes the call for the set of records after that location, then since it is at that point, it again makes that call for the set of records before that. \nSo, for example, if (event.rows = 10), when the scroll bar reaches the point for record number 11, datatable makes a call for records(11,20). However, at the same point, it makes a call for records (1,10), because the boundary is the same, and this continues in an infinite manner. Is this the right behaviour?\nSimilarly, when number of rows to be displayed in the table is 20 (event.rows= 40), when the scrollbar reaches location for row 41, calls for records(0,40) and (20,60) get called in an infinite loop until the user moves away from that location. Only the second call(20,60) should be triggered.. This is the same as #3377 . Please close this issue.. ",

I was really looking forward to this being resolved.  Am I missing something?\n\n. Same issues using the released 5.2.0.   onEditInit also does not provide event data.. Thank you guimabdo.  That is a good technique to keep in mind for situations such as this.\nI dug into the PrimeNg code, and found that pEditableColumn and pEditableColumnField are being emitted in the event.  The problem is that they have not been set to anything and remain undefined.   Another workaround is just to set these in our template, and whatever we set there will be passed into the event.  For example\n\n\n\n\n        ....\nwhere \nthis.cols = [\n{field: 'id'},\n{field: 'fieldName1'},\n{field: 'fieldName2'},\n....\n];\nand \"item\" represents a table record. I ran into this error message also, and initially thought as jbarber - I have a date: Date object in Typescript - so what is the problem?  As Pikad said, you don't have a Date object until you \"new\" it.  Typescript will allow you to \"let d: Date = '10/2/2012'\" (Typescript probably should not allow this), but that is not the same as \"let d: Date = new Date('10/2/2012')\".

Thanks for sharing the solution, this way you can also customize the dragging with drop.\nHowever, if it was only to disallow the drop but show dragging (you were also trying to not show the drag move as it look) one might also add custom levels to node data and use allowDrop.\njavascript\n{\n   id: 1,\n   label: \"Folder 1\",\n   level: 1,\n   children: [\n     {\n       id: 1,\n       label: \"Node 1\",\n       level: 2,\n       children: [\n         ]\n      }\n   ],\n   id: 1,\n   label: \"Folder 2\",\n   level: 1,\n   children: [...]\n }\nand return false on drop on the condition one is interested in, like in your case siblings are allowed else restricted..

For simple usability, it would make sense that on focus it automatically opens the dropdown and sticks your cursor in the filter list as the priority should be the filter list and not the dropdown (otherwise people would use the regular dropdown component).  I'm really surprised more people don't have an issue with this.. @cagataycivici Is there a reason this was closed?  I really think this should be reopened as it is not an existing feature and this thread was not resolved.. @cagataycivici  I think this may need to be reopened; I manually added this change in and it makes the big plus(+) go away (yey!), but the fieldset itself is still always toggleable (e.g. if I click the legend text, it still toggles).  Explicitly adding [toggleable]=false did not resolve the issue either.\nMy current workaround is to remove the link for the legend from the PrimeNG fieldset.js template as I am not utilizing any toggleable fieldsets in my application.. @aamir1995 Are you sure?  I pulled the most recent version and saw the *ngIf=\"toggleable\" fix included, but I could still toggle fieldsets off of legend text.. @ragavanrajan If you never need toggable elements, what I did as a workaround until it is resolved is to extract the fieldset component from the primeng library, then I put this in my project as a component and loaded my fieldset from it instead of primeng, then inside the fieldset template [which I extracted into its own html file so it is easier to read], I commented out the following lines (the link lines with the click event):\nhtml\n<fieldset [attr.id]=\"id\" [ngClass]=\"{'ui-fieldset ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all': true, 'ui-fieldset-toggleable': toggleable}\"\n    [ngStyle]=\"style\" [class]=\"styleClass\">\n    <legend class=\"ui-fieldset-legend ui-corner-all ui-state-default ui-unselectable-text\">\n        <!-- <a href=\"#\" (click)=\"toggle($event)\" [attr.aria-controls]=\"id + '-content'\" [attr.aria-expanded]=\"!collapsed\" [attr.tabindex]=\"toggleable ? null : -1\"> -->\n            <span class=\"ui-fieldset-toggler fa fa-w\" *ngIf=\"toggleable\" [ngClass]=\"{'fa-minus': !collapsed,'fa-plus':collapsed}\"></span>\n            <span class=\"ui-fieldset-legend-text\">{{legend}}</span>\n            <ng-content select=\"p-header\"></ng-content>\n        <!-- </a> -->\n    </legend>\n    <div [attr.id]=\"id + '-content'\" class=\"ui-fieldset-content-wrapper\" [@fieldsetContent]=\"collapsed ? 'hidden' : 'visible'\"\n        [ngClass]=\"{'ui-fieldset-content-wrapper-overflown': collapsed||animating}\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\"collapsed\" (@fieldsetContent.done)=\"onToggleDone($event)\"\n        role=\"region\">\n        <div class=\"ui-fieldset-content\">\n            <ng-content></ng-content>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</fieldset>\n  . @cagataycivici Did you close this because you added this feature or you're ignoring the request?. I was able to resolve the checkbox issue by following the directions given by Flat Badger here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50802045/checkboxes-and-radio-buttons-not-rendering-properly-in-angular-6-primeng-6/50818071#50818071 or here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kukko_primeng, which in short is to install primeicons with npm install primeicons --save and include the css in the styles within the angular.json:\n\"styles\": [\n  \"node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/omega/theme.css\",\n  \"node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css\",\n  \"node_modules/primeicons/primeicons.css\",\n  //...\n],\nUnfortunately, this did not resolve the radio buttons and they are still an issue and I am not sure why.  I can see the reference to the glyph in the class: .pi-circle-on:before { content: \"\\e911\";} and I can see the glyph is supposedly there <glyph unicode=\"&#xe911;\" glyph-name=\"circle-on\" data-tags=\"radio-on\" d=\"M853.333 448c0-188.513-152.82-341.333-341.333-341.333s-341.333 152.82-341.333 341.333c0 188.513 152.82 341.333 341.333 341.333s341.333-152.82 341.333-341.333z\" /> So it should work, but it isn't picking it up for some reason (despite the fact that checkboxes are now functional).. If you go here: https://primefaces.org/primeng/#/radiobutton the radiobuttons don't fill there either. Perhaps this is intended? If it is, I think it is a terrible idea, but maybe my radio buttons are working just fine; it's just that they made a glyph without a center in it.  Waiting for PrimeNg to respond before I close.. Hearing back from PrimgNg and from their point-of-view, they don't see a problem.  I am unclear if they don't see a problem because they're seeing what was intended as working as intended, or if they are seeing something different from me -- still some communication breakdown in that regard.. The issue was related to us using the Ultima theme and it overriding the glyph; it was resolved by updating the theme files with the newly-released Ultima sass files.. @jrcayetano Copy the files in the assets/sass folder from your theme to your project (all of the files that start with an underscore) and that will replace all of the font awesome references..

Thanks for your great job, PrimeNg is really great !. I got it working.\nIssue was coming from a misunderstanding on my side.\nrowIndex we get when using let-rowIndex is the index of the row in the current page of the table.\nIn order to handle correctly the grouping we must  calculate the actual index of the row we are creating, which is actually = to first+rowIndex, first is given by onPage event from the table.\nI can now handle this and I'm really happy ! ;-)\nI update my repo so that anyone is able to see the issue and see how the fix works.\n2 branches \"bugfix/showing-issue\" and \"bugfix/solution\". So I have a solution for the issue in my context. Not really sure it is acceptable.\nActually the problem seems conceptual. when reordering columns, PrimeNg detects dragged column then dropped column correctly. In the end the API uses dragged and dropped column's parent (the TR) and loops thru children, searching for TDs. \nIn the case of expansion row we need an extra first column to add the toggler icon which opens/closes the row. problem is that it sees the toggler as a regular columns but it's not, it's an extra column.\nSo my solution searches thru the parent's children for columns having preorderablecolumn attribute. \nHere comes the conceptual IMHO. Nothing forces developers to set the pReorderableColumn directive on each column of the table. in this case my solution will not work either.\nAny way I will propose this as a PR in case you think it's acceptable solution.\nProbably you can find a better approach, I just hope this can help in some way.. I'm new to plunkr so I hope this will be ok: http://plnkr.co/edit/ZnKbvMJFsS94EYcKG6Wo?p=preview\nas you can see, drag and dropping is not working correctly especially if you drag and drop rightmost column, you get an error.\nmy PR #5000 proposes a fix, I hope this helps.. This column has a technical goal (expand / collapse the row) and does not belong to the model of the data displayed in the table. Of course that would do the trick but IMO this is more some sort of hack than a solution. Problem comes from the DomHandler which should check wether a column belongs to the data or not.. @cagataycivici any chance that this issue be fixed in a short coming fix release ? #5000 provides a fix.

    "jboothe": "It would be fantastic if this feature would support any object. We run into this issue frequently and have to convert our lookup data to SelectItem which adds the unnecessary complexity of managing two datasources.  \nFor example: dropdown list of author objects that must be assigned as an author object on a book. Since the SelectItem object cannot be assigned to the book, must search for the original author object in the original author list and substitute it for the SelectItem before assignment to the book.  . I am not a big fan of mixing libraries, but I cannot work with the PrimeNG dropdown any more. I'm finally done serializing/deserializing lists, managing multiple lists, no-binding unless using a SelectItem, and dealing with one change event if using SelectItem and a totally different event signature when using a custom object. \nSo I've added the Angular Material dropdown (aka mat-select) to my project and my developer joy and sanity has returned. Of course at the expense of a slightly larger project file size, but fortunately that's not prime concern with our current project. \nmat-select has an elegant, intuitive API and powerful control over any list of POJOs. IMO, separating select and options into two components is what makes the difference. Here's an example I put together that illustrates some of its capabilities. \nI am a fan of PrimeNG, but their lack of attention to this issue does not inspire confidence.  Hopefully, PrimeNG will rebuild their dropdown with support for POJO first and SelectItem second.. I'm having the same problem with the p-calendar. Any word on a resolution? \n. ",

    "nhnb": "Pull request https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/pull/3771 fixes this issue.. Hello @BustyLoli-Chan I am a bit confused about your comment. As far as I can tell, the PrimeNG developers accept pull request on a regular basis. There are 699 closed PRs (the majority of them was either merged directly or accepted in a slightly modified form) and only 30 open.\nSo far, all of my other PRs have been accepted. Regarding this pull request: As I stated earlier, I am not completely happy about it myself. From my point of view, it is completely understandable that the PrimeNG developers prefer to deactivate Travis for now instead of introducing a bogus dependency.\nEdit: The red X behind the pull request is generated by Travis test run. It is not a decision by a human being whether the pull request is acceptable or not. The Travis runs are broken at the moment, so all PR got a red X. Since this is a bug with the test infrastructure and not with the PRs, the PrimeNG developers did accepting pull request despite that red X (please click on \"Closed\"-button on top of the PR list). Travis is inactive now, so new pull request will not get the red X anymore.\nThis pull request got a green tick because it fixes the Travis runs. But the fix has other issues as state earlier.\nI am sorry for the trouble, which I caused by suggesting to the PrimeNG developers (via a PR) to use Travis. It worked for a while but than it broke. I do not have a good fix at the moment.. I had another look and noticed a package-lock.json, which was committed before the update to Angular 5 and not modified since. Dependencies specified in package.json override entries in package-lock.json: therefore Angular 5 was pulled in. But webpack was not.\nDeleting this file (and the changes to .travis.yml to use node lts) fix the Travis build.. The cause of the issue seems to be a confusing about HTML-attributes and Angular properties. In HTML, an attribute evaluates to true, if it exists without value-definition or if it has any value (including the string \"false\"). \nTherefore all of the following lines set forceSelect to true:\n~~~~\n\n\n\n\n~~~~\nThe only way to set an attribute to false in HTML is to omit it.

Ah, that has probably been the confusion with this in the past, then.  Thanks for looking into it!. I am having some trouble getting it set up... If the below items are true, it should be all set (all on 12 hour time setting, time only):\n1. Pressing the up button on hour 25 times never causes it to go to 00:XX and always increments by 1 until 12, where it goes to 1 when the button is pressed\n2. Pressing the AM/PM toggles the AM/PM on both the inline and overlay in-sync (try on hours 12 and 1)\n3. Entering 12:31 AM causes the component to stay at 12:31 AM and not switch to 12:31 PM\nAlternatively, if you can give me the code to put in my package json or the plunker to get this installed correctly, I can check it out.. @SteveByerly Yeah, I tried but was unable to install it... I think that is something I was doing incorrectly, though. Any idea how to get that to work on this plunker so I can test it out there?\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/Ji8fIY5NVx6jaX3StpXI?p=preview. Hmmm... it is still failing on ng serve for me even with following your instructions there\nNo module factory available for dependency type: ContextElementDependency.

Previous value: 'ui-inputwrapper-focus: true'. Current value: 'ui-inputwrapper-focus: false'.\". Hello @cagataycivici, VirtualScroller indeed seems like the future but it lacks a very important feature that DataScroller provides. Removing/updating elements on a DataScroller component results in automatically updating the DOM. However, removing elements in VirtualScroller has no effect on the DOM structure. How can we achieve this?\nCheers,\nCuneyt. You just need to pipe your data in the HTML. All columns and data can still be dynamic, you just need to pass the value to render.\nFrom your example above:\n<ng-template pTemplate=\"body\" let-rowData let-columns=\"columns\">\n       <tr [pSelectableRow]=\"rowData\">\n          <td *ngFor=\"let col of columns\" class=\"ui-resizable-column\">\n             {{rowData[col.field] | number}} <-------- here is the pipe\n          </td>\n       </tr>\n    </ng-template>\n.

Previous value: 'ui-inputwrapper-focus: true'. Current value: 'ui-inputwrapper-focus: false'.\". @cagataycivici I am using 6.1.4 actually and indeed I saw the old issue that was closed and supposed to close this one. I tried to create test case on stackblitz but even the dropdown didn't open when I created a sample app. I will try again and provide with a sample code for this. Thanks for your time and reply. @cagataycivici I have tried to compile a scenario where I am facing this issue and here is a plunker https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-zsfc2n but the dropdown still doesn't display when clicked. Even though the DOM structure changes, by default the style has 'display:none'. You can reproduce the issue either by using the keyboard to change selected value or change the style 'display:block'. I am using a non-primeng modal component for overlay content, ng-bootstrap.. Thanks a lot for the answer, adding the DialogService into providers of the inner component solved the problem.\nCheers. This is not a bug, it is part of the accessibility system to highlight the selected elements to help screen readers. If you want to remove them, you can provide in CSS 'outline:none'. ",

I then have to select the full classes in my css:\n.test.ui-state-highlight, .test.ui-togglebutton.ui-button.ui-state-active {}\nIt was the only way that worked for me. . Now I understood the concept of the styleClass property. It is only an addition and not a full replacement for the original classes of that component. My misconception was that I thought it is a replacement. Thanks for your contribution guys. I'll close this issue now as it is clear. . @jayanth0907 styleClass is not a replacement for the original selectors, it is an addition. \nFor example: Let's say you have several toggle-buttons and one of them should be styled differently. This one should get an additional class via the styleClass property:\n<p-toggleButton></p-toggleButton>\n<p-toggleButton></p-toggleButton>\n<p-toggleButton styleClass=\"different\"></p-toggleButton>\nNow, in your css you can address all toggle-buttons with the following classes:\n.ui-togglebutton.ui-button.ui-state-active\nAnd to address only the third one, you can refer to the additional class:\n.different.ui-togglebutton.ui-button.ui-state-active\nHope this makes things clear....

Looks like there are other areas that are expecting column.field and column.header to exist e.g. CSV Export. The docs look like they call out these areas just missed the requirement on the column object properties:\n\nOther alternative is binding the cols array to the columns property and then defining a template variable to access it within your templates.

I think the key to hitting this issue is the combination of the following options:\n1) P-Multiselect for Column Toggle (as in the demo)\n2) Checkboxes for Multi select (as in the demo)\n3) Lazy Loading (as in the demo)\nNone of the demos have all three together though so the issue can't be reproduced in those.. No change in this issue with Angular 5.0 final (tried out of curiosity)\nI also opened a Chrome bug report upstream: \nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=781218. Chrome devs have confirmed this as part of a regression in Chrome in my upstream bug report. The last known good build from their bisect was  62.0.3192.0, with it being broken in 62.0.3193.0 and later. \nIt has been assigned for resolution upstream - see my above upstream bug report if you're interested in tracking this. I'll leave this open until its fixed.. I encourage anyone +1'ing the issue to voice themselves in the upstream bug report above. It has the active attention of some of the Chrome developers, but I don't think they necessarily realize the severity of the issue for those of us who are impacted. They are talking about punting it to Chrome 63 instead of the next stable patch cycle for 62.. @cagataycivici The Chrome Devs said the following upstream:\n\"You can certainly mitigate this in JS until the fix is out. The offending function is equalsByValue in vendor.XXX.js. It temporarily adds a \"_$visited\" property to the incoming object, and deletes it after finishing.\nDeleting properties is a very costly operation in V8 and should be avoided if possible. A simple fix would be set $visited to true/false and never delete $visited. This should also have a positive performance side-effect.\"\nIt seems this that this is related to #1937\nChrome is unable to commit to a fix in the Chrome 62 cycle, meaning that without a workaround implemented, this library will remain broken in Chrome until Chrome 63. . Closing since its confirmed Chrome 63 stable resolves this issue. This should also fix the root cause of #4306 according to the diagnosis from the Chrome developers in the upstream issue. ",

    "supermoon123": "The example provided above is a bug on sorting integers.  While it is a bug on sorting integers its also a bug on sorting decimals / money. The expected behavior on an data table with a column sort is to provide sorting on a numerical column in numerical order.  Using sortFunction to make a customized sorting for an numerical value is not the answer, its impractical. . https://plnkr.co/edit/l4JYVcfiyrl3qB88Ym0v?p=preview\n. Sudheerj, The  plnkr result had both examples one with integers and one with money / currency.  . Thanks for your comments and understanding.\nI have set the code to the proper format you requested.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/l4JYVcfiyrl3qB88Ym0v?p=preview\nSudheerj, The example you given me with datatables.net sort feature works out the box on all column examples, quantity, date, currency, name etc.   It would be great if primeng datatable could do the same.  Nevertheless you mentioned if i set the column type as a number it would resolved the issue. Please advise how to set the column type so I can try your suggestion and see the results for the quantity column.  I think if I'm able to set the column type in advance sorting could be done very easily then.  I looked through  primeng documentation and I'm unable to see such documentation on the column type. If you can provide a working example it would be appreciated and I would be willing to close the issue. . You mention this is design for smooth scrolling but causes a bug with pagination since it loads double. I have submitted the true bug to this issue. Vote up the issue to get the issue resolved. https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/4428. why would this be default behavior.  this is an pagination issue with virtual scroller 100 percent bug. .

This is why I can't apply, for example (like in the plunkr), a border to div.ui-fieldset-content using viewEncapsulation.\n. @cagataycivici do you have any thought on this?. @cagataycivici @Merve7 any chance to see this fixed? It's been some time... \ud83d\ude1e. Both calendars actually behave the same, just try picking today's date in both.\nIf you pick today's date, I think your variable todayDate is used, and since it's a new Date() object, it has both date and time. If you pick it again on the second calendar, startDate is used, which is todayDate itself, and so has the time again.\nOtherwise, a new Date object is created, given the day you selected and no time whatsoever (since there is no timePicker here).\nI haven't read the code since I'm quite in a hurry, but that's what I recall from my previous experience on PrimeNG's calendar!. I wanted to set up a PR with the given fix, though it's not enough. If resizing is done with an animation, the performance is horrible.. @cagataycivici I think this might be a breaking behaviour for a lot of developers... Any thought about this? Can you fix it in RC2?. Docs actually point to 5.2.0-RC2, and p-button isn't avilable in version 5.0.2.\n4854 really seems like a good issue, doesn't it? :). I think the only way to look at past docs is through file history on git... Not convenient at all.. Hi,\nI suggest to look at some Angular tutorials, since there are a few errors and misconceptions in your code.\nI fixed it a little, and you can see that everything works: Plunkr.\nI've been a CS student myself, so keep going on and don't stop on the surface of knowledge! :). Dup of #4839 . #5018 . @cagataycivici check this plunkr out while using Chrome: Plunkr.\nAs you can see, I'm not asking the first p-table to sort anything, and I'm not defining sortField or sortOrder, but the array binded to the p-table gets manipulated.\nThe second p-table has [customSort]=\"true\", and does not give a custom sorting function. This way, the output is correct.  \nI'm expecting to see the second behaviour by default, and not by using a gimmick.. Should be fixed now! https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/commit/0c55fb327aed0dc7def96b4e130e656bcc9f60a5. I've stepped into this bug myself, right now as a workaround I'm using a *ngIf binded to the same variable applied to the [(visible)] attribute. Not the prettiest thing (and not useful in many cases), but it might interest you: you can see it in action here.. Wrong repo! :)\nprimefaces. The logic itself is not broken, but attribute naming REALLY is.\nFrom docs: \n\nFor dynamic columns, setting pResizableColumnDisabled property as false disables resizing for that particular column.\n\nThat's so counterintuitive.. @cagataycivici I think the code should be [ngClass]=\"checked ? onIcon : offIcon\", dropping this..

However, I have an ngIf on a-component.  When it's  hidden then re-shown the p-dropdown is not rendering the selected item.  However, if I just click on the dropdown it displays the selected item properly.  In fact, seems like any change triggers it to display properly.  For example if the p-dropdown is part of an expansionrow, simply expanding the row displays it correctly.\nI was searching for ways to \"trigger this render\" and was going through every option on p-dropdown.\nSo when I saw your [style] suggestion, I thought EUREKA, that might \"trigger\" the display to render properly, and turns out it did!!! \n:D\nNote: if the devs are need a replicable scenario I can try to put one together on stackblitz. @priya-angularjs That's an interesting workaround you have found.  What do you do if the first tab is the one you want to make invisible?. @priya-angularjs @mmlitvin \nInteresting using the your \"workaround\" code is fine when setting [selected] to true or a hard coded comparison, \"i == 0\"\nHowever, using a method or a Map does not work.\nFor example, it will not work with either of the below two techniques:\n[selected]=\"isTabSelected('Communications')\"\n[selected]=\"activeTabIndex == iTabsMap.get('Communications')\"\nseems like it can't perform the eval...humph, I don't want to hard code anything since the tabs are so dynamic.\nsorry, the below actually did NOT work either, it only works if I use literal \"true/false\" or a literal number in the equality check.\n_!!

If you put square brackets around the property, then it will treat the contents of the double quotes as an expression to be evaluated. In the case of [field]=\"name\", it evaluates name as an expression, looking for a component property called name in order to use its value. If your component does not have a property called name, the sorting will fail. [field]=\"'name'\" on the other hand supplies a simple JavaScript string in single quotes as the expression, so this will work. field=\"name\" sets the field property directly without a binding, so the literal contents of the double quotes will be used to set the property without any evaluation.. Hi @cagataycivici. Thanks for your response, but I don't feel that the posted known issue with Chrome explains the misbehaviour of TurboTable in Chrome. The referenced article is about sorting behaviour, whereas the issue in TurboTable occurs when there is no sorting enabled. TurboTable should not be sorting the data if sorting is not requested.. Workaround to this issue posted to #5050. @tigrenok00 There's been an update. Try downloading 5.2.4. I got it yesterday and problem solved :-)\n. @ClaireStream Adding the colgroup did work for me (Thanks, cagataycivici).\nBut where I went wrong initially was I missed out the colgroup tag. I had <ng-template pTemplate=\"colgroup\"... and I had <col *ngFor..., but I missed out the actual <colgroup> tags.. Workaround to this issue posted to #5050 . Hi @cagataycivici , thanks for the fix. It works great now!. @cagataycivici  My point was rather that it shouldn't be sorting the data at all unless the user has requested it. Currently the data gets sorted whether you ask for it or not, and there is no defined way of stopping it other than setting an empty customSort method, which feels like a broken way of doing things.. Workaround to this issue posted to #5050. I've reported this issue too. It's happening because the data is being sorted even when no sorting has been requested, or before the user has clicked on a column to specify which field to sort on. Until this is fixed, my solution to this is to specify a custom sort function that prevents sorting if no sorting has been requested. (As an added bonus, this should make TurboTable even faster too!).\nThe code below is the example customSort function copied from the documentation, but with an extra if statement at the start to prevent unwanted sorting\nTS File:\n```\nimport { SortEvent } from 'primeng/components/common/sortevent';\n...\n  // Custom sort method to prevent sorting before sort field has been specified\n  // Written for single sorting mode only\n  customSort(event: SortEvent) {\n    // Do no sorting if sort field not specified\n    if (!event.field) {\n      return;\n    }\nevent.data.sort((data1, data2) => {\n  let value1 = data1[event.field];\n  let value2 = data2[event.field];\n  let result = null;\n\n  if (value1 == null && value2 != null)\n    result = -1;\n  else if (value1 != null && value2 == null)\n    result = 1;\n  else if (value1 == null && value2 == null)\n    result = 0;\n  else if (typeof value1 === 'string' && typeof value2 === 'string')\n    result = value1.localeCompare(value2);\n  else\n    result = (value1 < value2) ? -1 : (value1 > value2) ? 1 : 0;\n\n  return (event.order * result);\n});\n\n}\nTemplate file:\n\n```\nIf this is too complicated and you're just looking for a quick way to disable all sorting, you could always try setting sortMode=\"none\" (undocumented, but it works). Or you could also specify an empty sortFunction so that no sorting happens.\n. Just downloaded 5.2.4 and problem resolved! (Along with #5018) Many thanks!\n. ",

    "BootsThunderclap": "@cagataycivici Do you think the FontAwesome 5 SVG framework will be supported? At first, I thought using the FontAwesome 4 compatibility shim worked, but I've found a few areas where I'm still having trouble. Particularly, I've got a Breadcrumb Service that can add or remove MenuItem elements to a shared breadcrumb component. However, if the number of items in the breadcrumb array shrinks, I'm still left with a remaining chevron icon. This is because two-way binding doesn't work 100% with FontAwesome 5 SVG framework, due to the fact that  elements get replaced with  elements in the DOM.. That workaround is working for me, and I'm just hopeful that the order of events will always send the right object (or non-existence of) to the function. In my template, I'm using (onSelect)=\"onSelectUser(selectedUser)\" (onClear)=\"onSelectUser()\" (ngModelChange)=\"onSelectUser()\", and my implementation of onSelectUser() is:\npublic onSelectUser(user?: UserSearchResult) {\nif (user) {\n      this.userForm.controls.Email.setValue(user.email);\n      this.userForm.controls.UserName.setValue(user.userName);\n    } else {\n      this.userForm.controls.Email.setValue(\"\");\n      this.userForm.controls.UserName.setValue(\"\");\n    }\n  }\nI think the only reason this works is because (onSelect) is firing after (ngModelChange), but I'm not sure that will always be reliable..

    "jmmygoggle": "As a workaround until this is available, it is possible to add classes using Angular's ElementRef and Renderer2 instances (available via constructor dependency injection) along with a ViewChildren decorator assignment that focuses on providing a QueryList of ElementRef values from the p-table's template reference variable (#myTable).\nMy boilerplate is below and uses a template reference variable on the p-table element but also needed to subscribe for changes because the p-table element was dependent on an *ngIf and was not immediately available. This can be simplified if p-table is always displayed.\n```\n// Template excerpt\n<p-table #myTable\n//...\n// Component excerpt...\nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, OnInit, QueryList, Renderer2, ViewChildren } from '@angular/core';\n//...\nexport class MyComponent implements OnInit, AfterViewInit {\n@ViewChildren('myTable', {read: ElementRef}) myTable: QueryList<ElementRef>;\n\nprotected myList: MyListModel; // Contains list of things populating the table in its 'result' member\n\nconstructor(\n    private renderer: Renderer2\n    // ... (other things like API service to get list etc.)\n) {\n    this.createColDefs(); // Sets up dynamic columns/fields to be rendered in table and related properties\n}\n\nngOnInit() {\n    this.initMyList(); // Sets up the subscription for retrieving the list and eventually adds to the 'result' member of myList\n}\n\nngAfterViewInit() {\n    this.insertBootstrapStylesIntoPrimengTurboTable();\n}\n\nprivate insertBootstrapStylesIntoPrimengTurboTable() {\n    this.myTable.changes.subscribe(\n        (res) => {\n            if (this.myList.result && this.myList.result.length) { // conditional logic is same as logic in template *ngIf that determines if p-table element is displayed\n\n                const bootstrapClasses = 'table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped';\n                // Adding the classes\n                let primengTurboTable = res.first.nativeElement;\n                let innerTableElement = primengTurboTable.querySelector('table');\n                this.renderer.setAttribute(innerTableElement, 'class', bootstrapClasses);\n            }\n        }\n    )\n}\n\n```\nMy main aim was simply to get back some basic Bootstrap styles onto the TurboTable and defer the work and testing needed to implement PrimeNG's paid, Bootstrap-equivalent Avalon theme. My app's other features rely on Bootstrap 3.x styles and the older free bootstrap theme.css for the DataTable widgets but I wanted to take advantage of new TurboTable features.\nApplying TurboTable styles that are only available in more up-to-date free themes like omega conflicted with the free PrimeNG bootstrap theme and PrimeNG styles/themes don't seem to be designed to live within Component style encapsulation to prevent that PrimeNG bootstrap vs. free omega theme conflict.\n(No guarantees on how maintainable, robust or sensible this approach is.). This would certainly work for some folks applying their own styles.\nIn my case, I did not want to recreate either Bootstrap or PrimeNG bootstrap theme.css styles by writing new styles. At first, I considered creating my own version (or a patch) of the existing free PrimeNG bootstrap/theme.css with added .ui-table styles equivalent to .ui-data-table styles.\nI quickly realized this was error-prone and would introduce quite a bit of extra work, testing and styles to maintain, which ( @cagataycivici ) your fantastic UI library already helps me avoid. Because all the styles I require already exist in Bootrap CSS, I avoid the complexity and maintenance by simply adding a few Bootstrap classes to the table element inside TurboTable.. ",

If you have no unique key then all rows will be expanded where the  dataKey field matches they dataKey field from the row you want to expand. First question - why is a dataKey field used and not simple the index of the expanded row stored in the hash? Or at least for single expansion mode dataKey field should be unnecessary and a separated variable should hold the index of the expanded row.

Among the obvious ones, (PR #5602, #5603, and #5604), Some rules should be discussed on your side, IMHO, wether to decide first:\n if you want to keep those rules at all (e.g: prefer-const, curly ...)\n On the rules you want to apply, what kind of options do you want (e.g: no-inferrable-type)\nWithout those decision, you are just stuck with a useless tslint.json, and none of the rules wille ever applied, because you must disable tslint to avoid a shit-ton of errors screaming at you.\nThat's why I decided to take the rule-by-rule approach, that affects all files of the projects.\nAnother approach would be to clean the repo file by file, but for every rule. But for that we need to state for all the rules in tslint.json.\nAnd there are some opinionated decisions to make (e.g: for curly) So I can't be the one to make that call.\nI analyzed the tslint output, and found 32 rules that raise at least one error. If you want I can make a PR by editing those rules, and you can comment rule by rule what you think.\nThen, as we stated for the rules, we can clean file by file.\nOnce the repo is clean, we integrate tslint in the travis buid, so no single PR brings a tslint error ever again.\nPlease telle me what you think.\nI'm ready to help,\nCheersfully,\nJicmou.

It might be good to add some code which throws an explicit error (with a clear message) when the user attempts to enable both behaviors?. Thanks a lot!! I just realized that I hadn't linked it to the issue it fixes. Sorry!!\nThis fixes issue #5617 .. Thank you very much! This will make my life so much easier! \ud83d\ude03 . I agree... if you want to filter out elements, you should simply eliminate them from the DOM tree instead of just hiding it. Adding code to do that would make it more complicated, and I think it's best left as simple as possible. The Travis build failed with something not related to my code it seems... I only changed one line (completely unrelated to where the error is).. With this change, your use case is left undisturbed (just make it TreeNode<any> -- or just TreeNode). It will just allow for stricter typing control for those who would like it/need it. \nYour other multi-typed generic proposal could be interesting! I'd like to see it. Make a PR! :). ",

That's debatable, because TreeNode interface has expanded boolean field, which allows you to manage  the state of every node. Also there are onNodeExpand and onNodeCollapse output events to track state changes. So i doubt that we can call it a bug. Basically, in your example you always pass tree nodes with expanded = false (it just happens explicitly, because field is optional, and optional boolean field is false by default). \nSo in your example treetable always displays exactly what you passed to it, i dont think its a bug.\nBut its just an opinion, no hate.\nPS here is an example, where i really CHANGED the data (not created it from scratch like in your example), and nodes state keeps: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-ordi3f-gxwyho. Ofcourse it can be used, but not as easy, as you probably wanted to. For example, you can notify your \"pure\" onPush component when it needs to manually refresh itself (when you shallow-modify your data and keeping reference the same).\nMethods detectChanges() and markForCheck() are not hacks, i use them, i know a lot of guys who use them and you can use them too. It's totally ok.

Thanks a lot!. > Is there stackblitz template we can review?\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/primeng-issues-6912\nHere's what I've found: removing \"optionLabel\" attribute solves the problem. Somehow, using it alongside with item templates adds this classes to the elements. Just updated the strackblitz template to use the latest version of PrimeNg & Angular. The issue still exists.. @cagataycivici That it is very cool that it works for you. But, if you'd take a look at the stackblitz i've made you will see the circumstance under which is does not work\n. @cagataycivici Also, as far as I can see version 7.0.1 has never been released: https://www.npmjs.com/package/primeng. @cagataycivici Okay, now when 7.0.1 was finally released, I've updated the stackblitz to use and the bug is still here :(. So, in case somebody cares, i was able to concuct a solution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/primeng-scrollable-table-fit-parent  This seems to work as expected when the windows is resized horizontally.\nI've also used a hack inspired by this sample: https://stackblitz.com/edit/primeng-dynamic-scrollable in order to work-around another bug: header cells becoming misaligned.\nIt would be really nice if all this hacking was not needed and stuff just worked, so maybe this could be somehow incorporated into the next release, @cagataycivici?\n. @cagataycivici I think CHANGELOG has to be updated, so this is listed as a breaking change. @mertsincan I hate too be that pedantic, but i'd expect to see that under 7.1.0, not 7.1.0-rc.1 \nYou see, we use your great library in a stable product and we do not update to release candidates.

The issue is caused by hiding dropdown on window.resize event when there's some input (ex. for filtering) that is getting focus on control show. On mobile (Android) devices the soft keyboard is popping out and that rises window.resize event. Solution would be to check if we are on mobile device and react on 'orientationchange' event instead of 'resize' as it's not possible to resize window on mobiles/tablets (at least on most of them).\nI've created an Angular directive with temporary workaround (works on devices I have available to test) and example usage - the code is  here on Stackblitz, and here's direct link to the example app Be aware that it blocks the 'resize' event on mobile devices (but allows on 'resize' event on 'orientationchange').

This is a step ahead from what I had and few things to learn the way you have defined your variables. But if you observe the headers are repeating . Problem is there are 2 iterations : one on ng-template pTemptlate=\"items\" and the other on p-table. How can we avoid that ?

The reason I wanted to use p-table was because I have filters on the pick list data . And p-table has inbuilt filters that I could have leveraged. If there were no filters your suggestion works fine. But it looks like right now there is no way to show this kind of UI using prime ng's pick list. Below is the UI that I need to create . Any other ways I could achieve this easily with prime-ng ?\n\n. The p-table works fine with filters in the headers.

I am one of the users who would greatly appreciate this feature.

    "thiagogjt": "Sorry in advance for the poor english!\nAfter do some debug i have located the source of the problem.\nThe table component binds to document click event to verify the editing state:\nhttps://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/7964c937cb1d55d9bcadfb21285f21fe9c7959d5/src/app/components/table/table.ts#L1518\nI suggest that the component have an property to configure what component must have the click event binded.\n```typescript\n@Input() ref: any;\n...\nbindDocumentEditListener() {\n    if (!this.documentEditListener) {\n      this.documentEditListener = event => {\n        if (this.editingCell && !this.editingCellClick && this.isEditingCellValid()) {\n          DomHandler.removeClass(this.editingCell, 'ui-editing-cell');\n          this.editingCell = null;\n          this.unbindDocumentEditListener();\n        }\n    this.editingCellClick = false;\n  };\n\n  this.ref.addEventListener('click', this.documentEditListener);\n}\n\n}\nunbindDocumentEditListener() {\n    if (this.documentEditListener) {\n      this.ref.removeEventListener('click', this.documentEditListener);\n      this.documentEditListener = null;\n    }\n  }\n```. Another way is to test if the event cames from an overlay trigger:\n```typescript\n...\nisFromOverlayTrigger(event) {\n    return event.path.some(path => path.className && path.className.includes('ng-trigger-overlayAnimation'));\n  }\nbindDocumentEditListener() {\n    if (!this.documentEditListener) {\n      this.documentEditListener = event => {\n        if (!this.isFromOverlayTrigger(event) && this.editingCell && !this.editingCellClick && this.isEditingCellValid()) {\n          DomHandler.removeClass(this.editingCell, 'ui-editing-cell');\n          this.editingCell = null;\n          this.unbindDocumentEditListener();\n        }\n    this.editingCellClick = false;\n  };\n\n  document.addEventListener('click', this.documentEditListener);\n}\n\n}\n...\n```\n. Hi @bomberblue07\nSet the min-width property and it will work as intended.\nhtml\n<p-dropdown [options]=\"cities\" placeholder=\"Select a City\" optionLabel=\"name\" [style]=\"{'min-width':'90px'}\">\n</p-dropdown>\nBest regards\n.
