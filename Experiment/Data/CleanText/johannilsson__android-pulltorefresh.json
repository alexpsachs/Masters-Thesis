    "johannilsson": "Great job! This looks awesome. Now we just need to port smoothScrollBy :)\n. When reaching the top it should bounce back. That's a bug.\nSecond issue I'm not sure, I do think that's expected at least that is how the Twitter implementation works which is our current reference.\n. @mattg1981, @MantaMay Thank you, seems like SCROLL_STATE_FLING solves the problem with the view being visible. Will wrap it up during the weekend.\n@MantaMay I've done some test with TouchEvent to simulate a smooth scroll, but never got it to behave as good as I wanted so I gave up and just used scrollBy if smoothScrollBy does not exist. Think it works fairly good but smooth scroll would be preferred though.\n. Hide the pull to fresh label in a fling, its now only visible when pulling the list down. Thank you mattg1981 and MantaMay for this. Closed by f69140d6ae9b69678c63b32735e85e8730e97992.\n. Thank you!\n. I've seen this too, I thought that it should work out of the box with the fallback to scrollBy but it looks like it didn't. I added the scrollListBy method to be able to support lower versions than 2.2 and that intention is definitely still there, but current support is only for 2.2 though. \n. Oh that explains the strange behaviour thanks for the clarification. Will experiment with setSelection as soon as I find the time. I'll open this issue again so we have an issue to track this with.\n. Closed by e06ad15a275ed8827237ef2106a68e8fd42b5277\n. Wow, this works great!\nI will soon push this, I've made a small change though. I've moved the drawables back to drawables-hdpi for the library project, but added them to drawables folder in the example project. Because of the small percentage of 1.5 I don't think it worth to support 1.5 direct from the library. Instead 1.5 users need to move the drawables them self to the drawable folder for their projects.\nThank you again, I know this will be very appreciated by many users.\n. No problem, this was a very welcomed contribution.\nIt looks like the top padding is not longer divided with two any more, this was there to simulate a more resistant drag, that might be one of the glitches you're experienced?\n. Hi, just tried to apply this patch but I didn't managed to get it work. You don't happen to still have it around? A bit hard to see what's going on when githubs removes some of the tags.\n. Thanks for the report! I had the image replaced and added versions for mdpi and ldpi, could be that the old image had a padding included. I quickly fixed it for now by used adding a arbitrary value, guess we can tweak that until we're satisfied.\n. Thank you. I haven't though of doing it that way, will start to experiment with this as soon as I can. Until then I believe we can check the state much earlier so we don't go into the reflection parts if we're don't need too.\nI haven't experienced that it causes lag on any of the devices I've tested it on yet, but the amount of devices out there and that there might be better alternatives is definitely an argument to investigate this further.\n. Merged and pushed from a train with bad wifi. Thank you!\n. This is being worked on in #40.\n. Make sure that it's setup as a library project, if you're using Eclipse you might need to do clean on both the example project and the library project.\n. Happy to hear, you're right the + is not needed for lists.\n. Hi, this is being worked on in #11.\n. Thank you, will fix as soon as possible.\n. Hi, sorry for not commenting on this earlier. I have no plans to add support for ExpandableListView at the moment.\n. Thank you for the report. This is strange, I can clearly see it now when you mentioned it but haven't seen it before though.\n. Fixed in #18, thank you.\n. Better late than never I guess, now merged. Thank you!\n. Hi, thank you for the report.\nFrom the exception it looks like it origins from Androids internal and is not related to the pull to refresh view. I've seen some strange behavior with the list view on honeycomb before, but I'm not sure if they have change something or if we're doing it wrong. I don't have any Honeycomb device so please tell if you find out what is causing it.\n. Please re-open if this is still an issue.\n. Sorry for commenting on this earlier. I can reproduce the error, however this seems to be a problem with the list view in general and not actually related to the pull to refresh widget even if it manifest it self quite bad here. I plan to rewrite some parts of how the header is added which will remove the need for a \"tap to refresh\" view. I'm sorry but I will not fix this issue now, but if you like you can patch it yourself by calling scrollListBy(1, 0); from setAdapter and onAttachedToWindow.\n. Good catch, thank you.\n. Thank you for the report. I hope this fixes the problem.\n. Hi, thank you for this pull request. It seems like the indentation has changed which makes it quite hard to see what has changed and a lot harder to merge, would you mind opening a new pull request with changed indentation (4 spaces)?\nI'm not sure about having the vibrate thing implemented in this widget, I would rather see this being handled in a callback and be left to the implementer to decide if one want to vibrate, play a sound or whatever.\n. Thank you for the report. I'll be going away on vacation a couple of weeks, if you come up with an solution during that time please send a pull request. Sorry for not being able to look at this right away.\n. Thank you. What we need to do is to implement the pull functionality when there's no or just a few items in the list. This is why we need the tap functionality today. This is doable but requires a little more work.\n. Don't get me wrong I would also like to get rid of the tap to refresh but by removing it this way it removes the functionality to refresh the list completely. There's another pull request that attempts to fix this problem. Maybe you can try that branch and see how that works for you? I would also like to do some experiments by adding extra space at the bottom to fill up the whole screen to trick the regular pull to refresh to kick in.\n. There used to be a scrollListBy that used smoothScrollBy if available but has been removed since I think setSelection works just as good which is also called within the method resetHeader so the tap to refresh mode should go away if there's enough items in the list. But there's more work to it if we want to completely remove this mode.\n. That's true we can probably target api level 8 or greater soon, but I don't see how smoothScroll* is better to use here than setSelection does it behave differently except from the smooth part?\n. It's still to early to target 2.2. Here in Sweden my statistics for my apps tells me that it still quite a lot that is below this level (more than googles stats tells) so I don't want to drop it either.\n. No news yet. I guess what we can do is to give an option to disable the \"tap to refresh\" for now. Then we can implement this properly later on. So what I would like to see is an attribute added to layout and a method on the PullToFreshListView which can disable \"tap to refresh\", I don't want it to be completely removed.\n. There's a new pull request for this in #40. Please comment on how it works and test it if you like.\n. Thank you for the report. This is strange, it's using setSelection internally to hide the header. Will investigate.\n. I did notice that calling setSelection within onCreate had no effect even though this works fine using the standardl ListView. But this works fine in the example app;\n@Override\nprotected void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) {\n    super.onListItemClick(l, v, position, id);\n    setSelection(5);\n}\nIf i remove the method onAttachedToWindow in PullToRefreshListView the call from onCreate works as expected. I can't remember why I needed to override onAttachedToWindow now though. But please test by removing that and if nothing else breaks or anyone else have any problem with removing that method I'm happy to do it.\n. Ah that's why we needed it. Well then I don't want to remove it until that problem is solved. If you want to play around with it you can experiment by calling setSelection(1) from other places internally in the widget.\n. Hi. Could it be that you're trying to comple with Java 5 instead of Java 6? Seems like it's complains on some interfaces, annotations on interface was introduced in Java 6 if I recall correct.\n. Sweet, glad I could help.\n. I don't have access to this device. Any help to fix this issue is very appreciated.\n. There's a draft implementation of this in the short list branch. Thank.\n. Hi, I haven't had time to read up much on Fragments. What would be the benefits to use fragments here? Sorry if it's obvious but I guess it would get me started faster if I can get the big picture direct. \n. Thank you Jake, will look into it and see if there's a point wrapping it, just don't want to end up wrapping it and maintaining something that's not really a part of this project.\nHowever reading the docs for ListFragment there's seems to be an example on how to provide your own layout. It might work to just provide a layout with the PullToRefreshListView since it's compatible with ListView.\n. Thanks for the heads up it seems like you have to use @id/android:list when using a custom layout. Have you or someone else done a write up of the problems using this ID with ListFragment?\n. Thank you for the update. Would you mind setting up the needed fixes in a pull request and I would be happy to merge it.\n. Thank you, good catch.\n. Hi,thank you! The current implementation depends onListView so I'm afraid this is not possible or planned at this moment.\n. Hi @amokrane there's a recently released library that has support for GridViewS, you might want to give that a try. Haven't looked at the source code (that much) for that project yet, but it might be possible to port that into this library as well.\n. Pull request welcomed though :)\n. I've only seen this on a Samsung (if I recall correct) device that had bouncing list implemented everywhere. I can't reproduce this on any of my other devices and I currently don't own a Samsung device. So any help with fixing this issue is very appreciated.\n. Great work @chrisbanes, I'm closing this issue.\n. Hi, thank you for the report. It's hard to tell from the crash why this occurs. Can you provide an example app that triggers this or a description of how to trigger it in the example app?\n. Closing this for now.\n. @AllenCoder Thanks for the report, this library is deprecated though so keeping this as closed. I would suggest you to migrate to one of the alternative libraries listed in the readme instead.\n. Great finding. Would you like to send a pull request with the change or would you like me to just patch it?\n. If it's enough to use getHistorySize I guess we can skip the reflection part as well. Need to investigate that further. \n. Hi, thank you for the report. I don't have access to any tablet I'm afraid, and the emulator is terrible slow. Can you reproduce the crash in the example app too?\n. Thank you, this looks related to #37. Could you try the patch that's posted on that issue and see how that works for you?\n. Closed with bef2a2ad0e14f544fd12043f21b6c76853ba08a9\n. Thank you. This looks good will test and merge it later this week.\n. Awesome, merged now. Thank you.\n. Awesome, did some modifications in c64b4e29b044c9148808e4a55fbae99fce583703\nCurrently in the scrollfix_for_short_list branch.\n. Hi, thank you for the report. Sorry for being lazy here but can this be reproduced in the example app as well?\nYou could also try the scrollfix_for_short_list which initializes itself a little bit different.\n. Thank you for testing, will have a look at it and see if we can remove onAttachedToWindow.\n. @since2006 you're right that should be there, good catch.\n. Hi, could you try the scrollfix_for_short_list branch, I believe this was fixed in that branch too.\n. Ah, when scrolling fast I can reproduce it too. \n. Hi, sorry for the late reply to this. Just had a test at it looks good. Will need to change the code style to adapt to previous style though but that's a minor. Would have preferred to have upgrade of sdk and adt in separate commits but it's def fine for now.\nWhen there's very few items the OnEndOfListListener is triggered for every interaction with the list, like adding and removing items. Guess this is what's expected and up to the client to handle the event that's triggered.\nThank you, will merge later on today.\n. It's intended to be used with an ListActivity which would allow you to use (PullToRefreshListView) getListView() on 3.x as well I believe.\n. Hmm, can you reproduce this in the example app as well? Is it that you're using it with a ListFragment then this post might be helpful, https://github.com/johannilsson/android-pulltorefresh/issues/30#issuecomment-3284246\n. Closing this for now.\n. Are you testing the example project, is the library referenced correct and on which device and Android version is this on?\n. Have you changed the XML to reference the new package name as well? I've noticed that you renamed the package so I just want to be sure.\n. The sample works fine here from 1.6 to 4.0+. Since you've changed the package there might be something else you've missed to change. Not sure how you've set up the project but from the screenshot it looks like the library isn't linked correctly as a library project.\n. Well I have the same code running fine here, might be an issue with the environment? Tried with the latest Eclipse plugin? Here's a shot of my project setup in Eclipse, http://oi43.tinypic.com/otg7l0.jpg.\n. Awesome! For the package name, it has always been com.markupartist. Maybe you based your initial work on a fork that changed the package? Closing this ticket now.\n. You probably using Java 1.5, try with 1.6 instead.\n. Sweet! That sounds awesome - haven't seen Mono for Android before, please let us know how the progress goes.\n. Tack tack :)\n. Hi, I'm not merging this since I don't use maven myself and want to avoid extra maintenance work. Sorry.\n. Sweet thanks. Sorry for the late response to this.\n. It will stop when onRefreshComplete is called.\n. Hi, I believe #53 solved the issue.\n. This is not a bug, this is by design. There's a separate branch which aims to implement an alternative approach that removes the Tap to refresh view. @chrisbanes also have a more updated version of an Pull to Refresh implementation that might be a better fit for your project.\n. Link to the none deprecated version, https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh\n. Hey, you should be able to style the various elements using standard styles.\n. Maybe this SO question could help.\n. You need to modify the related TextViews manually to get this to run.\n. Thank you! This makes sense, cheers!\n. Hi thanks for the report. Do you have a fix for this running in a fork? Would love to see a pull request for this.\n. Hi @kalvish21, I don't plan to add it as it is now. However I would accept any pull request that implements this behaviour. I believe @chrisbanes version do support this though, https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh.\n. I believe this is by design since it is using a header view which will take up one position in the list. I believe your best option is to provide your own ids of the list that you feed through your adapter instead.\n. Thanks @keverets, great work!\n@ru-alxr would you like to send a PR with the russian translations?\n. I see, you need to fork the repository first.\nFrom github.com there's an fork button on the top right corner, next to star and watch. When you hit that button a copy of the current source/repo will be copied to a new repository to your account. This is the library you clone, commit and push your changes to. When that is done you can create a pull request. GitHub will automatically suggest this to you if you visit the repository through a browser. When that is done I can merge the changes into this repo.\nI can do the changes if you want, but it's always fun to get a pull request accepted on a project :)\n. Thank you! :+1: \n. Hi @lugenvn, thanks for the report. I'm closing this issue since it seems like it's related to @chrisbanes project rather than this implementation.\n. Cheers!\n. :+1: \n. :+1: Thanks!\n. I'm happy to add the resources but I don't want a method for a specific theme, e.g. the setLightArrow. I think it is better to extend the class and handle this yourself. Maybe refactor your setLightArrow into a setArrow or similar to allow easier overriding and configuration?\n. This looks good, can't test it at the moment. Will review properly the next days. Cheers!\n. Thanks for your comment, is this related to #88?\n. This is by design, there's an alternative implementation that @chrisbanes have done that you can get from here, https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/\nThanks for the report.\n. This is by design, it should show a tap to refresh otherwise.\n. Hi, I would suggest to migrate over to the SwipeRefreshLayout that's available in the support library for doing pull to refresh.\n. Hi thanks,\nI think this would be best handled by extending the widget or calling prepare & onRefresh direct rather than having it as an implementation within it. The addHeaderView is only supposed to be added once which is within the init method and should not be needed iirc.\n. Hi @leafseelight this library is over 6 years old and is not maintained anymore, a modern approach to this pattern is instead available in the Android support libraries.. Great job! This looks awesome. Now we just need to port smoothScrollBy :)\n. When reaching the top it should bounce back. That's a bug.\nSecond issue I'm not sure, I do think that's expected at least that is how the Twitter implementation works which is our current reference.\n. @mattg1981, @MantaMay Thank you, seems like SCROLL_STATE_FLING solves the problem with the view being visible.

Well I have the same code running fine here, might be an issue with the environment? Tried with the latest Eclipse plugin? Here's a shot of my project setup in Eclipse, http://oi43.tinypic.com/otg7l0.jpg.\n. Awesome! For the package name, it has always been com.markupartist. Maybe you based your initial work on a fork that changed the package? Closing this ticket now.\n. You probably using Java 1.5, try with 1.6 instead.\n. Sweet! That sounds awesome - haven't seen Mono for Android before, please let us know how the progress goes.\n. Tack tack :)\n. Hi, I'm not merging this since I don't use maven myself and want to avoid extra maintenance work. Sorry.\n. Sweet thanks. Sorry for the late response to this.\n. It will stop when onRefreshComplete is called.\n. Hi, I believe #53 solved the issue.\n. This is not a bug, this is by design. There's a separate branch which aims to implement an alternative approach that removes the Tap to refresh view. @chrisbanes also have a more updated version of an Pull to Refresh implementation that might be a better fit for your project.\n. Link to the none deprecated version, https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh\n. Hey, you should be able to style the various elements using standard styles.\n. Maybe this SO question could help.\n. You need to modify the related TextViews manually to get this to run.\n. Thank you! This makes sense, cheers!\n. Hi thanks for the report. Do you have a fix for this running in a fork? Would love to see a pull request for this.\n. Hi @kalvish21, I don't plan to add it as it is now. However I would accept any pull request that implements this behaviour. I believe @chrisbanes version do support this though, https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh.\n. I believe this is by design since it is using a header view which will take up one position in the list. I believe your best option is to provide your own ids of the list that you feed through your adapter instead.\n. Thanks @keverets, great work!\n@ru-alxr would you like to send a PR with the russian translations?\n. I see, you need to fork the repository first.\nFrom github.com there's an fork button on the top right corner, next to star and watch. When you hit that button a copy of the current source/repo will be copied to a new repository to your account. This is the library you clone, commit and push your changes to. When that is done you can create a pull request. GitHub will automatically suggest this to you if you visit the repository through a browser. When that is done I can merge the changes into this repo.\nI can do the changes if you want, but it's always fun to get a pull request accepted on a project :)\n. Thank you! :+1: \n. Hi @lugenvn, thanks for the report. I'm closing this issue since it seems like it's related to @chrisbanes project rather than this implementation.\n. Cheers!\n. :+1: \n. :+1: Thanks!\n. I'm happy to add the resources but I don't want a method for a specific theme, e.g. the setLightArrow. I think it is better to extend the class and handle this yourself. Maybe refactor your setLightArrow into a setArrow or similar to allow easier overriding and configuration?\n. This looks good, can't test it at the moment. Will review properly the next days. Cheers!\n. Thanks for your comment, is this related to #88?\n. This is by design, there's an alternative implementation that @chrisbanes have done that you can get from here, https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/\nThanks for the report.\n. This is by design, it should show a tap to refresh otherwise.\n. Hi, I would suggest to migrate over to the SwipeRefreshLayout that's available in the support library for doing pull to refresh.\n. Hi thanks,\nI think this would be best handled by extending the widget or calling prepare & onRefresh direct rather than having it as an implementation within it. The addHeaderView is only supposed to be added once which is within the init method and should not be needed iirc.\n. Hi @leafseelight this library is over 6 years old and is not maintained anymore, a modern approach to this pattern is instead available in the Android support libraries.. ",
