    "isair": "Updated issue details.\n. Implemented in #17.\n. @toygard Basically we should improve the example app. The first screen of the example app should be a list of styles (a UITableViewController should be used); when a style is tapped a player view controller with that style should pop and a video should start playing.\n. - Hides status bar (default: true)\n- Interface hiding time (default: 2 seconds)\n- Interface update time (default: 0.25 seconds)\n. Skin parser tests are done with #22.\n. @toygard Just a reminder for your future branches, please keep in mind that feature branches are prefixed with \"feature/\". So the name of this branch should have been \"feature/youtube-support\".\n. I have merged master onto this branch  as Swift style enforcing via SwiftLint has been added to it. Please run the following command on your local machine so the run script phase doesn't cause a build error.\nbrew install swiftlint\n. @toygard Merged it. Please check the last two commits I made when you have the time.\n. API for adding timed overlays should be similar to the following:\nswift\nplayerVC.showOverlayViewController(bannerVC, startingAtTime: 2, forDuration: 6)\nSo that more than one OverlayViewController can be shown.\n. https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/making-a-cocoapod.html\n. @toygard I have updated the issue description with the required changes.\n. @toygard The review-needed label shouldn't be added to a WIP pull request.\n. CircleCI seems to fail. Also these tests aren't correct, let's go over how you need to write them tomorrow morning.\n. @toygard @sahin I propose the following.\nMobilePlayerViewController\nswift\npublic enum State {\n  case Unknown, ...\n}\nswift\npublic private(set) var state: State = .Unknown {\n  didSet(oldValue) {\n    previousState = oldValue\n  }\n}\nswift\npublic private(set) var previousState: State = .Unknown\nStateHelper\nswift\nprivate func stateForLoadState(loadState: MPMovieLoadState, andPlaybackState playbackState: MPMoviePlaybackState) -> MobilePlayerViewController.State {\n  ...\n}\nNotes\n\nMobilePlayerViewController uses StateHelper to determine which state to assign to itself when either its load state or playback state changes.\nWe don't need more than a single enum because MediaPlayer framework already defines enums for its states.\n. @sahin Then what about having state and previousState instead of holding an array?\n. @sahin @toygard I'll update my original proposal then. You'll know that it's updated when you see state and previousState in it.\n\nEdit: Done.\n. @toygard You don't need to label pull requests as bug/enhancement/etc. Only review and progress labels should be used on PRs.\n. @toygard Have you checked what we talked about?\n. Volume control hide/show seems to be not working properly.\n\n\nWhile I haven't opened the volume control, it automatically appeared itself when I tapped the screen to hide the controls.\n. Closing as duplicate of #18.\n. Closed via 69a29e9.\n. @toygard I removed the enhancement label. Don't forget; you shouldn't label PRs as enhancement or bug.\n. @toygard What is this?\n. Closing as duplicate of #8.\n. @toygard I updated your comment to also include the configuration change I proposed. We can make a Skype call if you have any questions about it.\nIdeally, we should actually have a view controller for controlbar view and that should do the subview and constraint adding.\n``` swift\nprotocol ControlbarViewControllerDelegate: class {\n  func controlbarViewControllerPlayButtonDidGetTapped(controlbarViewController: ControlbarViewController)\n  func controlbarViewControllerPauseButtonDidGetTapped(controlbarViewController: ControlbarViewController)\n  ...\n}\nclass ControlbarViewController: UIViewController {\n  var delegate: ControlbarViewControllerDelegate?\n  let config: ControlbarConfig\n  ...\ninit(config: ControlbarConfig) {\n    self.config = config\n    ...\n  }\noverride func loadView() {\n    // Initialize view and add controlbar subviews and their constraints here based on the values in config.\n    ...\n  }\n...\n}\n```\nI'd much prefer doing this, but it'll take a bit longer. It is the proper way to do it though.\n. @toygard Looks fine, I'll approve this once tests are working. We also need to define SnapKit as a dependency of the MobilePlayer pod but I'll create a separate issue for it later.\n. @toygard The review label you have added is wrong, you need to add review-needed. needs-revision means rejection.\n. @sahin @toygard This is acceptable. But we already have a function for adding overlays. Instead of defining a separate logoView, that function should be used. I'll refactor this myself after all tasks are done for 1.0.0.\n. @toygard Could you also remove shareCallback from the config structure like we talked?\n. @toygard We need to have a call about this. This isn't the button action mechanism we discussed.\n.

Sorry to inform that it was taken out of the project before the 1.0.0 release. We believe it is better if people use other libraries for parsing video file URLs from pages of video hosting sites, as trying to support that increases the scope of this project significantly and adds a lot of maintenance burden.\nEDIT: I ran into the following library today https://github.com/hellozimi/HCYoutubeParser\n. This will probably happen after we switch from using MediaPlayer framework to AVFoundation, as storyboards have an AVKit Player View Controller item you can drag and drop.\n. As you said you can define a configuration with just top bar customization in it where it has a close button and a title label, but not an action button. If you don't want to do that, you can also hide the button view manually using playerVC.getViewForElementWithIdentifier(\"action\")?.hidden = true.\nHowever, you have made a good point; it makes sense to hide it when activityItems are nil. It's added to the roadmap now.\n. Reviewed 1 of 1 files at r1.\nReview status: all files reviewed at latest revision, 1 unresolved discussion.\n\nMobilePlayer/MobilePlayerViewController.swift, line 340 [r1] (raw file):\nYou're adding another callback for the .TouchUpInside event every time the activityItems change and is not empty. I believe leaving the callback attachment in the initialization and just changing actionButton.hidden when activityItems change is what should be done.\n\nComments from the review on Reviewable.io\n Sent from Reviewable.io \n. Checked. Thanks for your contribution @jacks205. The code needs to be edited a bit but I'll do that and merge it.\n. Fixed indentation and merged https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/commit/d58f7447835e2eafcd79acdc5d5c180df150d5f9\n. You should be able to do it. MobilePlayerViewController extends MPMoviePlayerViewController and doesn't touch the layout of its main view. Let me know if you're having issues and post a part of your code that is not working if possible.\n. You can add an event handler to it just like you would add to any button. You can get the close button view by using playerVC.viewForElementWithIdentifier(\"close\") as? UIButton.\nEdit Take a look at the documentation for more information. You can also check these parts in the source code: ElementConfig, MobilePlayerViewController.\n. PiP support will be added after #77.\n. We don't have APIs specifically designed to do those, but everything you have mentioned is perfectly doable. MPMoviePlayerController has an initialPlaybackTime property which you can use. As for saving the last played time, just hold the time value in a variable on close and pass it when playing again.\n. Are you adding the view controller as a child view controller?\n. Glad it's working! As for your questions\n1) Sadly, we don't have a fullscreen button at the moment. If you replace our player view controller with a standard MPMoviePlayerViewController and you're not having this black screen issue, then it's certainly a bug and a separate issue for it should be created.\n2) You can create an overlay with a play/pause button in it, then add it as a pre-roll and pause overlay.\n. I'll have time to take a detailed look at this tomorrow, so expect a fix soon.\n. I can't seem to find the sentence you mention in our README. Is it somewhere else?\n. Documentation's index.html is just the README file from when the documentation was generated. It's been outdated a little due to issues with the documentation generator.\n. Sadly we don't have a volume slider component yet. It is in our roadmap. For future reference, you can check all available components from our documentation.\n.

Please refer to https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/commit/b728d0481d44af1101ae14b97e156230f9b7f470 for the full list of changes.\n. Could you try again with the latest master?\n. Could you provide me with the steps to receive this warning? I can confirm that that path doesn\u2019t exist in the MobilePlayer target\u2019s search paths.\n\nOn 12 Oct 2016, at 03:07, rezasham notifications@github.com wrote:\nIt works.. thanks.
