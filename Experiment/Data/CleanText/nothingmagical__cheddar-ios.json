    "soffes": "Something to solve crashes relating to tasks failing is definitely important. Your commit makes the textfield lose focus if the task fails or succeeds. I'll think on it.\n. The networking code delete the core data object if the create fails. Maybe delaying this the duration of the animation would solve this issue. Kinda hacky though :/\n. I like that approach @carsonmcdonald. I'll think on it.\n. Closing for now since this is more a discussion than code that can be merged. Thanks again for you effort!\n. Thanks so much! I can't thank you enough!\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Thanks so much for your work. I have some designs in mind. I'll get going on it soon.\n. I appreciate your effort on this. I had planned on merging, but got motivated on a plane and implemented it from scratch. Thanks though!\n. You don't have to do this. If you run rake setup, it will do all of this for you. Also, just for reference, you can do both of those with just git submodule update --init --recursive.\n. It's all good. Yay for recursive submodules :)\n. Like I said before, you just need to run rake setup like the instructions say to get going.\n. I've gone back an forth on this. I think you're probably right though.\n. Right. They did enable edit mode and then open settings. They never explicitly ended editing. They will most likely want to end editing after viewing settings so I think it's the right interaction.\n. I dig it. Thanks!\n. Glad you got it.\n. Instead of adding all of that HTML, is there way to add those resources as a submodule?\n. Sorry @moredip, could you send a separate pull request so all of those assets don't stay in the git history? Sorry to be annoying, but keeping clones fast is important.\n. <3 <3 <3\n. Can you edit the readme with instructions how to run it? Thanks!\n. Thanks so much for fixing this!\nDo you think you could rebase those commits? :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for this. There is actually an API for hiding the shadow besides clips to bounds. Mind using respondsToSelector and switching it out?\n. Looks good. Thanks man.\n. Looks great. Could you pull from master so it can automatically merge? Also could you remove the PSD from your pull request. Don't want to clutter git with big binary files. If you want to send it to sam@cheddarapp.com though, that would be awesome :)\n. Thanks so much for your work on this! Love the icon! I might tweak it a bit (to use the Cheddar blue used elsewhere).\nThis is a very welcome addition. Thanks again.\n. Good call!\n. Love it! Thanks so much!\n. Thanks! I appreciate it. I know it doesn't have any effect, but clarity is always good.\n. I'm actually going to implement this similar to how it works on the web with little badges. Thanks though!\n. Good call. Thanks!\n. This repo is no longer maintained.\n. It is supposed to be an error as the instructions say since you are intended to change it.\nAlso this repo is no longer maintained.\n. ",
    "Benuuu": "Would it be more appropriate to animate when the task is created with success?\n. ",
    "carsonmcdonald": "@Benuuu I don't think that would work. The user needs to see the animation right after the action. It is hard to solve the failure case in a easy way. The failure could be temporary for example. A more comprehensive fix would probably be separating the local data storage from the network sync but that is a larger task.\n. It does seem a little hacky because you are introducing another bit of information to the outside caller. \nAnother option I thought about before the reload here was a \"has it failed yet\" flag. The only issue is that there could be a race between the failure happening and the final failure block getting called since the final failure block gets called after the task is deleted. Maybe it would be less hacky to have the failure block execute before the task is deleted and then just have a flag that checks for failure in the animation block. To be complete it would need to be synchronized around the table insert but that shouldn't be too big of an issue. Thoughts? The callback could actually be called pre and post delete if needed (could just pass a flag that says what stage it is being called at).\n. @samsoffes For what it is worth I made the changes in my local repo and it seemed to work. I would have made another pull request but I was being lazy because moving the callback was a change to a different repo. If you are interested let me know and I'll send a different pull.\n. ",
