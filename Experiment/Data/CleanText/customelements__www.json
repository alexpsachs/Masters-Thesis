    "zenorocha": "Thanks @djalmaaraujo :)\n. Done by @djalmaaraujo ~ https://github.com/customelements/fetch-service \n. We didn't have the chance to do this because the elements we created needs some updates =/\n. Twitter Button updated\n. GPlus Button updated\n. Github Button updated\n. Facebook Button updated\n. I left some comments there @karan...\n. Cool! We need to do the same on WC.org:\nhttps://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponents.github.io/issues/124\n. PRs merged and new releases were made updating the Polymer version.\n. Thanks @brunoqueiros :)\ncustomelements.io\n. Fixed on #12\n. Your element is already there, but before closing this issue, please fix your project's description.\n. Thanks for fixing it @lucasmazza :)\n. Great!\n. Awesome!\n\n. Thanks for reporting @flowck and @djalmaaraujo for fixing it :)\n. Hey @atilafassina,\nThanks a lot for sending this PR, you've submitted it right :)\nJust one question, is there any special reason for using 40em instead of another number? What about a breaking point for tablets, which number should be?\n. > The reason I didn't do it from start is that I wanted to check with you guys if the solution I found for the table (removing the description) is really the best one at this point, and if that idea of breakpoints focused on the elements seems suited for you in this project.\nYes, it worked really well. We just need to change a little thing: instead of removing the description, we should remove forks and stars. Description is the second more important thing here.\n\nSo, for the this mid-view that would correspond to a tablet (sort of...) that would be my idea... then I would go on expanding the viewport to see if there's another adjustment to do in any other element.\n\nSounds good to me, let's do this :)\n. Awesome!\nThanks a lot @atilafassina for sending this PR, really great job!\n\n. hahahahahahah\n. Hey @rsmelo,\nThanks for submitting it.\nThere are a few things you need to do:\n1. Take a look at this PR I made: https://github.com/rsmelo/twitch-tv-element/pull/1\n2. Change the description of your repo: \n\n. Perfect! Thanks @rsmelo :)\n. @rsmelo is there any reason for this repository to have the issues disabled?\n. Awesome! Great job @nbluis :)\n. Awesome!\nGreat job @gustavoisensee :)\n\n. Awesome! Good idea @cesarwbr :)\nCould please just change the element filename from google-analytics-element.html to google-analytics.html and also it's definition on Polymer: https://github.com/cesarwbr/google-analytics-element/blob/master/src/google-analytics-element.html#L1\n. Added! \\o/ \n\nThanks @cesarwbr :)\n. Added! \\o/ \n\nThanks @rsmelo :)\n. I think this repo fits the purpose of the project.\nBut before accepting it, here are some things you should change it:\n1. Elements must be named in lowercase, separated by dashes. Which means that ninjaPresentation should be renamed to ninja-presentation.\n\nPS: Pull requests and issues must be discussed in English.\n. Awesome! Great job @viniciusalmeida :)\n. Hey @naoufal,\n\nThanks for send this component, but unfortunately we can't accept it because this is a gallery for Web Components.\nI suggest you to send your project to jQuery Plugin Registry.\n. Awesome! Good job @gustavoisensee :)\n. See also: https://github.com/gustavoisensee/linkedin-element/pull/1\n. Awesome! Good job @g200kg :)\n. See also: https://github.com/g200kg/webaudio-controls/pull/1\n. I took a look at your project source and I highly recommend you to check: https://github.com/customelements/boilerplate-element\nThere are a couple of documentation and organization tips that you can use it to improve webaudio-controls.\n. Closing because this link will be displayed on WebComponents.org\n. Hey @mpaiva,\nOur primary goal is just hosting Web Components on our gallery. We're not planning to \"compete\" with Brick or Bootstrap.\nWe'll be more than happy to feature your element on customelements.io.\n. You're overwriting id attribute. What happens if a user wants to define a CSS id?\n. Hey @gustavoisensee,\nWhy name it as tumblr-basic instead of just tumblr?\n. Duplicated #27\n. Hey @gustavoisensee,\nReally great job, Google +1 Button's API is really amazing.\nI don't think we should have a different element for each action, let's group them all into one and specify them using type attribute just like Twitter Element does?\n. Waiting for your PR on GPlus element :)\n. Hey @gustavoisensee,\nGreat job!\n1. Why using typeButton instead of just type?\n2. Why using titleButton instead of just title?\n3. Why options 1,2,3,4 instead of more descriptive names?\n. Hey @uniqname,\nGreat job! \n1. Is there any reason why your element your repo is called x-picure instead of x-picture?\n2. What the ng namespace means on the element name?\n3. What do you think of using your gh-pages branch to demonstrate your element?\n\nP.S: You can find some tips about project organization and documentation on https://github.com/customelements/boilerplate-element\n. That's great! Nice job @uniqname :)\n. Hey @correiamateus,\n1. Your repo description is outdated.\n2. What happens if someone wants to add more inputs to this form? I don't think we need to recreate form tag if the only if it does is to restrict you for adding more fields.\n. :)\n. Hey @vagnervjs,\n\nI didn't know about Animoby, interesting tool.\nGood job!\n. Great job @deepak1556 :)\n. Great job @herschel666 :)\n. Great job @devinhalladay :)\nSee also: https://github.com/devinhalladay/hn-button/pull/1\n. I don't get the point of this PR for several reasons.1. There's nothing related to Web Components2.

Thanks for submitting @pennyfx, it would be nice if you guys provide some live demos on gh-pages branch or add a link to the demo.\n. Really nice component @kashiro, looking forward for the options table :)\n. \n. @felipenmoura there's a HTML element for that already, why create another <blockquote>?\n. Just saw the demo, got it! Nice idea :)\n. I could never reject a pokemon element :)\n. Are you sure that is a Web Component?\n. Added at #108\n. What about infinite scrolling + sorting by stars?\n. Nowadays we fetch the number of stars from each repo, so why create a ranking system if GitHub already have that feature?\nWhat we're trying to solve here is the amount of elements in the page, we need a better solution to display them.\n. Infinite scrolling provides a better user experience when compared to paginated elements (like bower.io does). However, the user cannot reach the footer in this solution.\nI had a conversation with @bernarddeluna about how we should implement this feature and I think we figured out a solution for now.\nWe load the entire JSON but only show 50 elements, that way search continues to work without any changes in the server. These elements are going to be ordered by number of stars instead of alphabetical order. A \"load more\" button will be provided and when clicked 50 more elements will appear and so on.\nWhat do you think?\n//cc @luanmuniz @cironunes @djalmaaraujo \n.

Hey @poying,\nIs there any online example?\nWe're suggesting people to put their codes on GitHub Pages, what do you think?\n. Closing this due to its inactivity...\n. Awesome!\n. Great component @alexroutledge :)\nJust one thing before merging, according to the spec, custom elements need to be named with two word separated by dash. So I recommend you to rename your component and repo to current-location or something like that.\n. You should rename the GitHub repository too, because we list on the website based on this info.\n. Awesome! Just added it @alexroutledge :)\n. That's awesome! Great job @ghostoy.\nCouple things before merging:\n1. Please fill the project description on GitHub and README, instead of: \"Fork this repo if you want to start your own Custom Element\" and \"TODO: Write a project description\"\n. Added! Thanks for sending it @ghostoy :)\n. Hey @ghostoy,\nHave you tried to run it on Canary?\n. Merged! Thanks @ghostoy :)\n. Hey @webf,\nSorry for my delay on answering this.\nThis seems like a very nice project, but before accepting what do you think about improving the name?\nI think it's very generic right now. Try to take a look into http://customelements.io/ for inspiration.\n. I think that \"Web Components Toolkit\" could be the description of the project.\nHowever, a name needs to be more unique.\n. Sounds good to me.\nIn order to publish, please rename GitHub project name and description.\n. Cool, sorry for my delay on accepting it.\nJust included: https://github.com/customelements/customelements.io/commit/ae0a313918beb322473af847b551fb996331d602\n. This is great! Congratulations for the element @ghostoy and sorry for my delay on accepting it.\n. Hey @tantaman,\nThis was probably a server downtime, it's working here.\n. That's cool!

Hey @pedropolisenso,\nYou're using a very outdated version of Polymer. I really recommend you to update it and fetch this dependency using Bower instead of CDN.\n.

Hey @karan, thanks a lot for sending this PR along with @tomalec :D\n. I didn't quite understand why using the _site folder... we're not using Jekyll or anything like that.\n. We also had some conflits regarding the Polymer version when running bower install\nUnable to find a suitable version for polymer, please choose one:\n    1) polymer#~0.2.4 which resolved to 0.2.4 and is required by customelements.io\n    2) polymer#~0.3.1 which resolved to 0.3.1 and is required by facebook-button#0.1.4, github-button#0.1.4, gplus-button#0.1.5, love-heart#0.2.0, twitter-button#0.1.6\n    3) polymer#>=0.3.0 <1.0.0 which resolved to 0.3.1 and is required by core-component-page#0.3.1\nI think we could just remove the polymer entry on our bower.json file since the other dependencies already fetch it...\n.

Hey guys,\nIt's been a while since this idea was proposed but I wanted to let you know that we thought about it and we'll probably provide a REST API for people to add their own elements. There still many many things to arrange but we'll keep you updated on that. In the meanwhile, here's a sneak peek: \n\n. We decided to not publicize this API docs at this moment. There's constant changes being made and we'll be focusing our time on making the search experience better instead.\n.

Unfortunately that element is a little bit outdated.\nThe Polymer team now recommends you to fetch your dependencies using Bower instead of the CDN: http://www.polymer-project.org/resources/faq.html#is-the-code-hosted-on-a-cdn\nAnd also import the Polymer HTML file inside your element, just like: https://github.com/webcomponents/polymer-boilerplate/blob/master/src/my-element.html#L2\nThose are just recommendations, I'm adding your element anyways :)\n.

Since most of them already have a bower.json file and uses the web-components keyword, now we just need to register them.\nI went through all repos and registered:\n- [x] google-calendar\n- [x] google-chart\n- [x] google-sheets\n- [x] google-streetview-pano\n- [x] google-url-shortener\n- [x] google-youtube\n- [x] google-youtube-upload\n- [x] google-map\n- [x] google-apis\nRepos that doesn't contain a release yet:\n- [x] google-analytics-elements (https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-analytics/issues/3)\n- [x] google-drive (https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-drive/issues/5)\n- [x] google-cloud (https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-cloud)\n- [x] google-hangout-button (https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-hangout-button/issues/2)\n/cc @addyosmani @ebidel \n. Oops, I thought they could be published since the repos are public and you guys have announced it.\nJust asked to remove it: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#issuecomment-48096468\n. By the way, I don't think registering a package makes you the owner of it: http://bower.io/search/?q=google-youtube-upload\n. Publishing and registering on Bower is completely different from publishing and registering on npm. \nRegistering a package on Bower means that a certain name is reserved and related to a certain Git endpoint. By doing that your repository enters to a simple JSON file. Nothing more than that.\nThe one who registers it do not become the \"owner\" of that package or have any other special permissions upon it.\nPublishing a new version on npm depends on a CLI command that only the owner have rights to run. Again, this is completely different from Bower where you just need to push a Git tag. And, of course, the only ones that can push Git tags are those who have push access to that repo.\nTo be honest I don't think there's any problem on registering those packages on Bower.\nPublicizing not-ready-projects in a website or talks causes much more impact than making them discoverable in a search website.\n.

The reason is because Bower has not updated it.\nSee: http://bower.herokuapp.com/packages/x-html\nI believe you need to remove the package from there and register again. Once you do that, let me know so I can remove the old package from CE.io.\n. http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/#unregister\n. Yes there is @ceolter, @keppelen could you check? I'm swamped with clipboard.js\n. Error detected. One repository was published to npm but didn't had a package.json file.

This is super awesome, thanks a lot @mkautzmann, you're the best ;D\n. That's not true. CustomElements.io fetches both npm and bower packages that contains the web-components keyword. \nThe reason why your package wasn't showing is not related to this.\nProblem fixed: https://customelements.io/lastmjs ;)\n. Yes, we can definitely do that. Could you send a PR?\n. Yes, that's a known problem. Turns out bower just removed the only way of fetching packages by keywords. There's no more https://bower-component-list.herokuapp.com/keyword/web-components. They deleted the heroku app and github repo.\nI'm looking into alternatives to fix that problem.\n. Ok, so the temporary fix is now live.\nI was able to set up a new Heroku instance using that same source code: http://bowerwebcomponents.herokuapp.com/keyword/web-components\nLet's see how this will work out in the next couple days.\n. It is now https://customelements.io/ruud/responsive-iframe-element/ ;)\n. Awesome ;)\n. For the reasons described above, it takes couple hours for packages to be fetched from bower. You can register them on npm as well if you want to speed up the process.\nInstall commands are fetched from the bower.json file.\n. Hey @christophe-g, we fetch that link from your GitHub repository. \n\n. It's back again https://customelements.io ;)\n. Thanks for reporting everybody and sorry for the inconvenience. \n.

I don't think that another package manager is a good solution. We already use the web-components tag for components.\nI like the idea of a REST api, but the github pull-request method is also pretty simple. What are the benefits of this REST api?\n.

    "atilafassina": "Just made a pull request about the responsive layout.\nNot so sure if I did right, though, it was my first pull request...heh\n. Hi @zenorocha,\nGlad to have submitted it right, I was kinda nervous about messing something up...\nStraight answer: yes, there're media queries missing for viewports between 40em and the default.\nMy point with these media queries is to work with breakpoints specifically to each element, like Ben Callahan suggests in this article. The idea is to go finding the media queries focusing on the elements, not on devices viewports. I've been using this approach in some projects and it's been more comfortable.For me, it looks more scalable and organized.\nSo, about the 40em, I wanted to get the smallest view first, and then as we expanded the viewport, it will just go towards the first view, in that way we would have the \"starting point\" (40em) and \"ending point\" (default). As I tested, some media queries I put 40em can even be increased, I was just \"playing safe\" to begin with.\nThe reason I didn't do it from start is that I wanted to check with you guys if the solution I found for the table (removing the description) is really the best one at this point, and if that idea of breakpoints focused on the elements seems suited for you in this project.\nIf you think it's ok, I can keep working on that, if not we'll see the best way...\n(thanks for asking!)\n. Getting back to the tablet question... (forgot to address that, sorry)\nI just took a quick look at my browser, and since layout start looking a bit aukward still on 750px wide. I'd suggest another breakpoint with 75em, while font-size is 10px. That one to keep the input for adding a web component and that related text with 1 column (not 100% as it is in the smaller one, though). I'd also set a different font-size for the h1 title becuase it looks a bit squished to me on that viewport.\nSo, for the this mid-view that would correspond to a tablet (sort of...) that would be my idea... then I would go on expanding the viewport to see if there's another adjustment to do in any other element.\nWhat do you think?\n. Whoa! Nice, @zenorocha ! So glad to hear that!\nSo, just commited those changes: I also changed the old media queries.\nsmaller view: 30em\nmid view: 45em\ndefault: anything bigger than 45em wide\nI think those values are more accurate.\nOne thing worth commenting: even though the font-size is 10px in the body, media queries values obey the browser default, which tend to be 16px. So, for future adjustments, maybe we should have that pointed out somewhere...\n. Oh yeah!! \\o/\n\nThanks a lot!!!!\n. ",

    "robdodson": "Could you update the element so it can be installed with bower. The element-boilerplate has a guide to follow.\n. Could you update the element so it can be installed with bower. The element-boilerplate has a guide to follow.\n. I don't think it's ready to be added to customelements.io\nI created it as a proof of concept, so it needs to be updated. It only supports a small subset of what chartjs can actually do. I can try to work on it or if someone wants to fork and take it over I'm cool with that as well :smile: \n. Could you update the element so it can be installed with bower. The element-boilerplate has a guide to follow.\n. It will install fine, but you can't depend on polymer this way because your element ends up in the user's bower_components folder.\nIt should instead be ../polymer/polymer.html.\nThe element boilerplate has a build step which strips bower_components out of your paths and converts them to ../. That way you can test your element, and create a distribution that can live in bower_components.\n. No worries, thanks for updating! :+1: \nWe've actually been working a lot on figuring out boilerplates, documentation, getting started, etc. We're hoping to have some new stuff coming out in the next week or two. Stay tuned for that.\n. I think if you use the web-components keyword, and register your element in the bower registry, the site will automatically pick it up\n. @enguerran bower will remove duplicate versions of a library which is good for the web. You can't load two version of Polymer, for example, in your app. It will break.\nIf you're using npm you can run npm dedupe but that's an extra step that many new developers would miss. Also, many people think of npm as being specific to node.js packages and bower as specific to web packages. Of course you can put whatever you want on npm but not everyone realizes that :)\n. If you have two components, x-foo and x-bar, and they each indicate that they depend on polymer in their bower.json, then bower will figure out which version is the common version, and place only one copy in bower_components.\nIf you do this with npm, then each component will get a copy of Polymer (possibly a different one) in their node_modules folder. It is a common Polymer pattern to do a relative import of Polymer at the top of your file assuming there is only one version sitting in bower_components. If everyone tried to import their local copy from node_modules then it would blow up. So you'd have to run npm dedupe to get it down to only one version.\nI haven't seen an example of how Bosonic does imports but I'd be curious to see how they handle this situation.\n. Bower will point that out. If I install x-foo that depends on Polymer v0.1.2 and x-bar that depends on Polymer v1.0.1, bower will tell me it can't decide which to use and ask me to resolve the dependency. npm would not do this. It would install each version of Polymer into the respective component's node_modules folder.\nEdit\nIf you install Polymer as a peerDependency in npm it would actually notify you of this problem. It won't if you install it as a regular dependency.\n. Also make sure to include an import for polymer at the top of your element's html import file. Like this\n. Thanks @mvaldetaro. One more thing, your import should be <link rel=\"import\" href=\"../polymer/polymer.html\">\nThat's because when someone installs your element using bower, it will be inside of their bower_components directory and the directory that holds Polymer will be a sibling.\n. Hey @cmartinezv, thanks for submitting this. I think the project structure might need a bit of work in order for it to be shareable. Please take a look at our guide for creating reusable elements.\n. Cool!\nOn Fri, Feb 27, 2015 at 6:42 AM, Giovanni keppelen <notifications@github.com\n\nwrote:\n[image: :+1:] ;)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/webcomponents/customelements.io/issues/210#issuecomment-76404468\n.\n. Your component should include an import for ../polymer/polymer.html at the top. Just like this\n. We recommend that you don't prefix your element name with polymer-*. Use something that is more specific to you or your project. Otherwise LGTM\n. In your readme you call it x-feedback in a few places. I think even that would be preferable.\n. ah I see. the element is called 'x-feedback' but the repository is called 'polymer-feedback'. Yeah I would rename the repo to 'x-feedback' to match\n. You need to change this line: https://github.com/SrMouraSilva/sr-list/blob/master/sr-list.html#L1\n\nShould read ../polymer/polymer.html. When people install your element, it will already be in their bower_components directory.\nhttp://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html\n. @ruiramos why'd you decide to close this and make the package.json private? I think this is a pretty awesome component\n. Hah this is awesome. :heart_eyes: \n. The Polymer team's perspective is that it's better to prefix the element\nwith something that's specific to yourself or your project. Let's say\nsomeone goes and makes a bunch of twitter bootstrap elements, it would be\nmuch nicer to see twbs-button or bootstrap-button instead of\npolymer-button (which doesn't really tell me anything).\nThe other big point here is that Web Components should be interoperable\n(vanilla web components, polymer and x-tags can all play nice together). So\nsomeone using a custom element shouldn't need to know or care about what\ntechnology was used to make that element. As far as they're concerned, it's\njust a custom element! We want to encourage that. We don't want people to\nthink that they can't use something because it was written with Polymer\ninstead of X-Tags, or that you can only build Web Components using a\nparticular library.\nOn Wed, Jul 30, 2014 at 1:31 AM, Ionel Cristian M\u0103rie\u0219 \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm curious what @zenorocha https://github.com/zenorocha thinks, he\ndidn't complain when I submitted my elements to customelements.io (I\nnamed them polymer-select-box and polymer-query-box)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/webcomponents/customelements.io/issues/269#issuecomment-50587843\n.\n.

For now it is of course possible to use the wildcard * for looking up all components, but it is not very user friendly (I had to take a look at the source first) and sorting isn't possible. Additionally it would be probably good to have sort of a tag cloud for quick keyword scanning (remove web-components of course)\n. ",

OK, I think I have a possible solution. Is it fine to target master in the PR? The CONTRIBUTING guide does not specify that and there are a few possible branches...\n. :+1:  Cool! Looking forward to submit some custom elements I'm working on to the website too.\n. It looks like the description (maybe other components too?) is not being properly escaped. I'm taking a look.\n.

This one, the only problem I would suspect is that my bower id is not exact the same as repository name... any way I think it should work  \nmy project is https://github.com/MartinsThiago/easy-router\n. I also checked bower registry and I could find my project and @ceolter's project too, probably a service of customelements team is the one with problem\n. I couldn't check yet if customelements is fetching from npm packages\n. Until now and no news, my project was not fetched yet :cry: \n. :D nice Zeno o/\nps: Valew, tu \u00e9 fera...\n. ",

The only reason that prevents me switching from vaadin to your element is that your element desn't support freezing columns which is a musthave feature for mobile and tables.

I would like to see how it looks on that web site and fix what I don't like.  Also, how does customelements.io figure out what the install command line should be?  Mine should be bower install web-map... thanks!\n. OK, I will have some patience, but I changed the bower.json file 7 hours ago to include the \"web-components\" keyword.  I guess it only looks at the bower.json in the master branch?  And it uses the \"name\": \"web-map\" property for the install command, perhaps?  I have looked at a few other people's bower.json files and I haven't seen another place for the installation info.  Thanks sorry to bug you.\n. ",
