Sure, just use the onBlockChange event callback\n``` javascript\nplayYoutubeOnBlockChange = function() {\n    if (scrollorama.blockIndex === indexOfBlockYouNeed) {\n        // Code to play youtube video\n    }\n};\nscrollorama.onBlockChange(playYoutubeOnBlockChange);\n```\n. This will probably fix it: https://github.com/johnpolacek/scrollorama/pull/35\n. ",
