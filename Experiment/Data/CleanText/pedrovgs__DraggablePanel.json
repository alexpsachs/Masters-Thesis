    "pedrovgs": "Hi!!\nIt's a known issue. When I created this repository I put a section inside the readme with some TODO. One of them is: \"Create other draggable component to resize elements instead of scale the view. This new component is needed to drag and resize videos\". \nI will do it if I have time or may be other developer could implement this feature and send me a pull request :)\n. Right now I don't have time to implement this feature. I'm waiting for a pull request from a buddy, but I don't know when is going to be ready. Sorry\n. Hi!\nI've released a new version of this library with the version number 1.1. This new version contains the fix to use VideoView with DraggableView class and resize the VideoView instead of scale it.\nThanks for your feedback!\n. You can build this project using maven or gradle, professional and most common build tools. I'm not going to support more build system, sorry. \n. What's your Gradle version? I'm using Gradle 1.11 and I don't have this problem compiling :S How do you reproduce it?\n. Hello?\n. @patelajay745 can you tell me how reproduce this error? I asked you about the gradle version you were using :)\n. What are you doing to get that error?\n. Build the application using Gradle. Clone this repository, follow README.md instructions to install YouTube player dependency and execute ./gradlew installDebug\n. ./gradlew build\n. If you execute ./gradlew build from your terminal inside the project directory you'll generate a build of the project.\nIf you execute ./gradlew installDebug you will instal the sample project into the phone/emulator detected by adb.\n. You should not try to compile this project using eclipse because the build tool used in this project is Gradle and eclipse doesn't support it as should. \nTo build this project you can import it using android studio or intelli j and press the play button or execute the command I told you in the previous comment. \n. Thanks!!! :)\n. Thanks!!!\n. Done :) Thanks!!\n. I don't understand your problem. Do you have any screenshot or any project uploaded to a public repository to see what's going on?\n. Bump!\n. In YoutubeSampleActivity we are using Fragments and is not supported. If you use youtube player view instead of youtube fragment and DraggableView instead of DraggablePanel this library is resizing the video properly.\n. Please...upload your project to a public repository to be able to review what's going on\n. Bump!\n. Please...upload your project to a public repository to be able to review what's going on\n. We are going to close all your problems in #17\n. @jayachandrakuruba we are trying to fix this issue, but I need to see your code to help you. My demo is working find :S. Can you give me access to your repository to take a look?\nFYI, I'll try to fix a similar issue reported by @manpreetsinghsodhi.\n. @jayachandrakuruba I've released a new version (Release 1.3) with some fixes. Can you review if your I've fixed your problem with this release?\n. @jayachandrakuruba I'm working to support orientation changes. Release 1.3 is working fine for you?\n. @jayachandrakuruba can you check if this branch or the previous release fix your problem? https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/fix-video-view-sample-problems\n. @jayachandrakuruba can you upload a screenshot or video to review your problem?\n. @Fiddl3 is this issue related just to VideoPlayer?\n. Ok, thanks for your help!\n. You can change the fragment associated as top fragment using Android Fragment Manager yourself. I'll try to implement this feature to replace fragments. You can send me a pull request with this feature if you want.\n. I need to take a look to your code. Can you upload your project to any public repository or give mi access to take a look and help you with your problem?\n. @ngnclht1102 have you sent me an email?\n. We are going to close all your problems in #17\n. We are going to close all your problems in #17\n. We are going to close all your problems in #17 \n. Guys I was on holidays and I couldn't comment about this issues. Sorry.\nInstead of copy paste code modifications why don't you fork this project to your github and send me a pull request with your changes?\n@manpreetsinghsodhi  if you want some help, please upload your project to any repository and give me access. My mail is pedrovicente.gomez (at) gmail (dot) com. And I'll take a look.\nPlease, don't open more issues related with the same problem. I'm going to help you with this in this issue and close other issues opened by @manpreetsinghsodhi because every issue opened is related with the same problem.\n. I'll take a look this weekend. Thanks!\n. @Fiddl3 thanks! @manpreetsinghsodhi can you check if that version of the library is working for you?\n. @manpreetsinghsodhi  I've created a new branch with a ListView below DraggablePanel in YoutubeSampleActivity. It's working fine to me.\nhttps://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/manpreetsinghsodhi-issue17\n. @manpreetsinghsodhi I think I've found the bug. It's related with YouTube player view. This view is executing requestLayout when I still think my view was in other position :) I've changed onLayout method to fix this issue. Please, review if it's working for to and tell me to do a public release to maven central.\nThis is the branch: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/manpreetsinghsodhi-issue17\n. \\o/ Released and uploaded to Maven Central Repository in Release 1.3.\n. As Fiddl3 says, you can use setHorizontalAlphaEffectEnabled method to enable/disable this visual effect or use xml customization based on attrs. This library is going to apply that effect but some views are not going to support it, this is an Android bug and not a bug related with this library.\n. You need to configure your maven local repository to be able to provide that dependency. YouTube developers are not providing that dependency in Maven Central and you have to install it manually.\nI've one section in this project README file talking about this. https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel#building-the-sample-app\n. Can you upload any screenshot or video to show this problem? I'm not able to reproduce it.\n. @manpreetsinghsodhi can you take a look at https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/fix-horizontal-drag-problems I've been working to improve horizontal drag implementation and it seems to work again in this branch :)\nOnce you validate this branch I will release this feature to 1.4 version\n. Can you upload a video with that movement? Thanks!\nOn Dec 1, 2014 9:30 AM, \"manpreetsinghsodhi\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi Pedrovgs,\nFirst of all thanks for taking time in solving the issue.\nI tested this branch. It is working fine on left drag(on minimized view)\nbut when we drag right sometimes it goes left again and whenever this\nparticular case happens the view after going out of screen comes back in\nminimized state on right side . Rest everything is fine..\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/issues/20#issuecomment-65033247\n.\n. Thanks to @Fiddl3 I've found the bug \\o/. @manpreetsinghsodhi can you review if it's working fine for you?\n. @manpreetsinghsodhi can you review if this branch is working fine for you and fixes the bug related to the horizontal drag? I'd like to integrate this branch and release a new version :)\n. \\o/ @manpreetsinghsodhi I'll merge that branch and generate a new release asap. Thanks for your help!\n. Can you upload a video or screenshot with your problem? \n. @Amritpal33 I'd like to review your problem, could be related to other changes not just with getMinHeightPlusMargin method. Can you upload one video or one screenshot reproducing your bug?\n\nI'm working to fix one issue related to the horizontal drag effect, issue #20 . Can you review if this branch: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/fix-horizontal-drag-problems fix your problems?\n. You might close this bug now? I need to integrate that fix and I'm waiting for a pull request of @Fiddl3 xD\n. Please, create different branches for different fixes. One to fix video view position using resize transformer, other to support landscape mode. Create your branches from the development tip.\nTo fix video view position you can change every variable related to video view position or size to int instead of use floats.\n. hahaha, good luck with your project! I'll wait for your PR. Thanks!\n2014-12-04 22:09 GMT+01:00 Fiddl3 notifications@github.com:\n\nI think I already hanged all variables to int, except for\nscaleTransformer, but I will review this again...\nThis evening (very late) or tomorrow. With fixes for landscape mode You\nwill have to wait, when I find some time to figure how really Scale\ntransformer works (for ResizeTransformer it works and this is what I needed\nfor my project).\nI'm working on project which requires rtmp stream (flv [x264+speex])\nplaying and I having some issues with audio/video sync... It's nightmare....\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/issues/21#issuecomment-65704045\n.\n. @Fiddl3, @Amritpal33 I've found and fix the bug with VideoView and Resize transformer \\o/. Thanks to some help of @Fiddl3 !!! Can you check if it's working fine to you and your applications? I'd like to release this fix to maven central this weekend. You have the code in this branch: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/fix-video-view-sample-problems\n. Ok @Fiddl3, I'll wait for your PR. But compile and check that branch. The sample project is working fine without take into account the right margin.\n. This is a screenshot of video sample in a Nexus 5 -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjZHh0Q2NBRi1TZkU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAnd this in a Samsung Galaxy S3 -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjOXZXQkRQM0F3X1U/view?usp=sharing\nVertical drag is also working :)\n. Here you have a video where the VideoView is released and smoothSlideTo() is executed as minimize() method does.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjRzdQVU9fdEd5Z2s/view?usp=sharing\n. @Fiddl3 's pull request has been merged. I'm going to release a new version today :)\n. I can't right now because I'm working in other projects, sorry. Can you upload some screenshots with your problems. The VideoView problem in landscape is already know but I can't reproduce the other problem :S. \n. @Fiddl3 are you going to send me a pull request?\n. Please, update your branch with develop to avoid conflicts ;)\nThanks!\n. I've also fixed one issue related with the horizontal drag effect. Review this branch if you need it: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/tree/fix-horizontal-drag-problems\nI'm going to integrate it once the reporter of the issue tell me it's working as expected.\n. Please, send me an email to pedrovicente.gomez@gmail.com with every detail to avoid retro compatibility problems and talk about this :)\nI've also added one checkstyle configuration to the project and linked it to the travis CI build. Review this in your branch once be updated with development tip.\nThanks for your help!!!\n. Hi @dangalg. If you have fixed the landscape problem, why don't you send me a pull request?\n. Maybe you can start reading some articles about how github works http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1\n. That's normal, you are trying to push to my repository and you don't have permissions to do that. Review some articles about github and how to use it. You have to fork my project and clone your fork, not this repo. Change your repository code and then send me a pull request.\n. Guys? How is this issue. Have you already fixed this? I'm waiting for your PR.\n. @Fiddl3 are you working on this? What's the state of this feature?\n. Ok! Good luck with your personal project!!!\n. That feature is not going to be implemented.\n. Hi @Amritpal33! @ppamorim is working on a PR to implement your requested feature. This PR will be merged and a new version of DraggablePanel will be released once the PR be ready!\n. Hi @IlyaGazman! Thanks for your pull request :)\nReview your branch, your PR is breaking the build.\nRelated to the code, I'm going to fix this issue changing some variables using float to use int, because it should be declared as int xD. Your PR doesn't fix the bug I have with VideoView sample and compare floats using a delta is not the best approach.\n. I've merged other pull request from @Fiddl3 that fixes one problem with ResizeTransformer and apply some changes that are not compatible with this PR. I'm going to close this PR.\n. Nice PR, can you update this branch with pedrovgs:develop?\n. xD Revert your build.gradle changes to use an older version. I'll update that dependencies later.\n. Can you restore the value of MINIMUN_DX_FOR_HORIZONTAL_DRAG to 5?\n. Yes, should be density dependent. We can do that in other PR.\n. There is something wrong with tv shows sample, ScaleTransformer and this branch :S. Here you have a video https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjbDZQcU4tR1ZfblE/view?usp=sharing Can you take a look. This is the last fix needed to merge this PR :)\n. Review also how you measure your max bottom position. I've changed your <item name=\"y_scale_factor\" format=\"float\" type=\"dimen\">2</item> to <item name=\"y_scale_factor\" format=\"float\" type=\"dimen\">2.3</item> and is working as you can see in this video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjZndQOE9vSDNCa0E/view?usp=sharing\n. Thanks @Fiddl3 for this pull request!!!! I'm going to update project readme with a contributors section and you will be there :) What's your name and last name?\n. If you are using this library in any project, please send me an email with\nthe project name and link to update README.md file with that information.\n2014-12-06 14:20 GMT+01:00 Fiddl3 notifications@github.com:\n\nNo problem :)\nI'll continue working on lanscape support when I'll have time\nI'm Rafa\u0142 Pluta\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/pull/27#issuecomment-65896706\n.\n.

I'll take a look this night if I have time, Thanks @Fiddl3 !\n. @Fiddl3 thanks!\n. I need time to review this. Let me check it this weekend ;)\n. Do you know if this bug is still reproducible?\n. @Amritpal33, @Fiddl3 can we close this issue? Or can you still reproduce it with the last library version?\n. @Amritpal33 are you using resize or scale transformer? Can you upload a screenshot or a video with your problem and also paste here your DraggablePanel/DraggableView xml configuration?\n. Do you have the screenshot?\n. bump!\n. @vuhung3990 review your MediaPlayer usage. I'm using VideoView for this sample and the resize is working as expected.\n. @Fiddl3 YouTube sample is not using ResizeTransformer because take the resize value and move it to the DraggableView  is not implemented. Remember DragablePanel uses DragableView inside.\n. @vuhung3990 was this issue a problem with your MediaPlayer or can you confirm if it's related to DraggableView?\n. DraggablePanel is a DraggableView facade and is not easy to support resize feature right now. You can use DraggableView with resize enabled and add your fragment manually as DraggablePanel does. That's why the sample code is not using this feature.\n. Can you upload a screenshot whit your device layout bounds option activated?\n. I don't see any problem :S can you add an arrow or something like that pointing to the problem? Why do you say that youtube player is going to stop the video if youtube fragment is under some view? \n\nI guess you are using the last library version.\n. @ninja-tortoise can you upload your previous DraggablePanel configuration to a sample project? I'd like to fix this issue :)\n. The current workaround is change your DraggablePanel to use DraggableView. I'm trying to get time to improve this project but I'm working in another open source project right now...sorry.\n. Thie setTopViewHeight is a method only valid in the portrait mode. If you want to develop a landscape mode you'll have to override some of the current behavior.\n. That feature has to be implemented out of DraggablePanel.\n. I don't understand the effect :S do you have any schema or drawing to show me this?\n. @ppamorim bump!\n. That's not in the original youtube component. I've added your feature to maximize minimize but this doesn't match with the feature look and feel. Sorry.\n. I don't see any problem, can you upload a video and specify better where is the problem?\n. @ppamorim can you show me how to reproduce this bug?\n. Hi @ppamorim! First of all, thanks for your pull request!\nYou should review your branch because you have some checkstyle issues:\n/home/travis/build/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/draggablepanel/src/main/java/com/github/pedrovgs/DraggableView.java:297:7: switch without \"default\" clause.\n[ant:checkstyle] /home/travis/build/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/draggablepanel/src/main/java/com/github/pedrovgs/DraggableView.java:298:7: '{' should be on the previous line.\nHere you have the full build details: https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/builds/47370138\nTo avoid problems with your IDE configuration you can use this Square project to configure IntelliJ or Android Studio with the correct code format configuration: https://github.com/square/java-code-styles\n. No problem @ppamorim the important is the pull request :). Your name looks familiar to me, are you from Spain or speak spanish?\n. Hey @ppamorim  are you going to update this branch with the changes I suggested you?\n. That's could be great! Remember to update the readme project with information about this feature, just one line.\nLet me know when you update your branch to review it again and prepare another pull request with TextureView and RTSP video.\nCheers!\n. Hey @ppamorim  why have you added code not related to this pull request like the RtspSample? Please, revert your changes and use different pull requests for different features. One for the RtspSample and other for \"click to maximize\" feature. I'm not going to review all this code if it's not in different branches.\nUpdate also your branch with development, you have updated the android gradle plugin to 1.0.0 and that change is already in development.\n. @ppamorim code reviewed! Take a look to my comments please. In addition you should update your branch with my \"development\" branch to be able to see if Travis accepts your branch.\nYou forgot to add the same configuration to DraggablePanel class and connect it with DraggableView. I left you some comments about this.\n. @ppamorim, please, update your branch with my development branch. I need to see if Travis CI build is of for this pull request and I can't do it if you don't update your branch.\n. If you update your branch with my development branch you'll se how Travis CI mark your pull request as \"invalid\" because right now, your code doesn't compile. Review my comments, please.\n. Take a look here https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/ and https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/. You can use sorcetree if you want. You'll have to resolve some conflicts after commit and push.\n. @ppamorim you have some problems with the checkstyle -> https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/builds/48468744\n. Hey @ppamorim I see your build is ok, but when I've tested your code I've seen your feature is not working with the YouTube sample. You have changed activity_youtube_sample.xml to use your new feature but the feature is not working. Here you have a video to show the problem: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjc25IS05HaXBZbmM/view?usp=sharing \n. Then, modify the sample and use your feature in the famous places sample instead of the YouTube one. Add also some javadoc with this information inside setClickToMaximizeEnabled and setClickToMinimizeEnabled  methods for DraggablePanel and DraggableView classes.\n. Sorry @ppamorim I've been working 12 h per day this week. I'll try to merge your pull request this weekend. Do you need a maven central release with this feature?\n. Branch merged! Thanks for your pull request @ppamorim!!\n. @ppamorim a new version of DraggablePanel has been released to Maven Central Repository. New version 1.6 is ready to be used!\n. This project is using ActionBar Sherlock just for the sample code. That's not important. I used sherlock because this repository was published before Android 5.0. If the code of the sample project is not related with DraggablePanel usage I'm not going to change it. Sorry.\n. No thanks, I think the usage of ActionBar Sherlock or the new Android-L features is just a detail, what's  important for this repository is the library.\n. I'm not sure about that feature :S I don't like that shadow and the code we will have to implement to add that shadow doesn't worth.\n. Send me a pull request, but try to keep that feature as simple as possible. Forget about customization and add just the YouTube default shadow please. I don't want to add a lot of code just to add that shadow.\n. Hi @ppamorim!\nYou have another bug in this branch. If I use your feature the user can't minimize the view manually. The only thing a user can do to minimize your view is to open app navigation drawer. I have to tap in other list element to maximize the view.\nHere you have a video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjSjBFaFlSR2JkT0k/view?usp=sharing\n. Can you use another drawable to put inside navigation drawer? Another drawable related to the sample UI.\n. Now, everything seems ok. I'm going to merge this pull request and publish a new release to Maven Central. Thanks @ppamorim!\n\n. Already reported in #22\n. You have the library artifact uploaded to maven central. http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.github.pedrovgs|draggablepanel|1.7|\nI'm not going to support eclipse for this project. Sorry.\n. ./gradlew build\n. @ppamorim  is this issue duplicated?\n. As @ppamorim says, the problem is related with the view you are using inside DraggablePanel not with this library.\n. No idea, but that's seems related with your code, not with the library code. Review your layouts :)\n. Is this pull request a fix for #47?\n. Thanks for your pull request!\n. Please, can you tell me what is this pull request going to add to the repository? Is this a new feature or a fix? I'd like to have more information before to start reviewing your code.\n. To organize features we are using issues not a changelog. Thanks for your idea, but I prefer github issues.\n. Landscape mode is not supported right now with ResizeTransformer. There is an issues requesting that feature.\n. Hi @DuongNTdev I see you already have a patch? Are you going to send a PR?\n. We could do it, but right now I'm working on other projects. Feel free to send a PR :)\n. We should not add more dependencies to this project in order to perform any animation, we are already using Nine Old Android.\n. You have a method in DraggablePanel and DraggableView with name setClickToMaximizeEnabled(boolean enableClickToMaximize) which enables the effect you are looking for.\nThis is the DraggableViewmethod implementation:\n``` java\n/\n   * Enable or disable click to maximize view when dragged view is minimized\n   * If your content have a touch/click listener (like YoutubePlayer), you\n   * need disable it to active this feature.\n   \n   * @param enableClickToMaximize to enable or disable the click.\n   /\n  public void setClickToMaximizeEnabled(boolean enableClickToMaximize) {\n    this.enableClickToMaximize = enableClickToMaximize;\n  }\n```\nYou can also enable this effect from your layout using draggable_view:enable_click_to_maximize=\"false\" xml attribute:\n``` xml\n\n    <!-- ....... -->\n\n\n```\nIs this the answer to your question?\n. Are you using the library namespace like the sample shows? xmlns:draggable_view=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n. Can you show me the diff? I'd like to know what you've modified to get that error.\n. The correct attribute is:\nxml\ndraggable_view:enable_click_to_maximize_view=\"false\"\nThe README.md documentation is not following the attrs.xml file: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/blob/develop/draggablepanel/res/values/attrs.xml. Sorry I'm going to update it.\n. I've updated the README.md with the documentation updated. Is this the fix to your problem?\n. You are welcome!\n. The build of this branch is broken in Travis-CI. Can you take a look?\n. We've already talked about this in other issues, Youtube Library does not support alpha or size changes, that's not a problem of the library.\n. @DuongNTdev I've seen this patch in other issue and I've already asked you about a pull request so I'm going to close this one. Can you review your code and send me a PR with the changes?\nThanks!\n. @frakc can you review this PR? The build is failing :(\n. @frakc your implementation to keep the view state after the device rotation is not valid. Using android:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize\" in the sample activity you are configuring your activity to not reset the activity lifecycle. This implementation is not valid because if the library user wants to show different layout in portrait or landscape this implementation is not going to work.\nRelated to the checkstyle, this one is the one used by Square. I suggest you to review your code instead of remove the rule failing.\nI've also seen some files modified just to add some white spaces should not be there or splitting lines. Review this files and revert your changes please, these changes are just adding noise to the PR.\n. @frakc your PR is not passing in Travis-CI. Can you take a look before to start with the PR review?\n. :)\n. Thanks for your PR @Mariovc I've been out for some time. I'm going to merge it and release a new version right now. Thanks!!!!\n. Sorry guys, I've been out for some time :(. As @Glurt says the small view has to be ABOVE the top view in the xml file. @yongsunCN If you thing this should be in the project readme feel free to send a PR with the documentation update. Every PR is welcome. \nAs this issues seems to be fixed, I'm closing this issue.\n. Right now the library does not support this feature. I've already opened some issues about this one, so I'm going to close this. If you want to implement full screen support without use the library I recommend you to use a different layout in landscape mode. Cheers!\n. As @Nguyenduylinh1402 you have to change the order :)\n. This issue is related to the #78 so I'm going to close it, sorry.\n. I'm so sorry @DanhDueExOICTIF but with the current implementation this feature is not supported :( We have to rewrite part of the core library to support this feature you need right now.\n. Hi @redwerk can you also review the usage of the method getSupportActionBar() The code is not compiling because the compiler can't find this method.\n. Sorry for the delay @redwerk, I've been out for some time. You have some checkstyle issues. Can you review it and fix it to get the build working on travis?\n. Seems related to the Travis-CI configuration. This is the failure output > failed to find target with hash string 'android-23' in: /usr/local/android-sdk Can you take a look?\n. Hi @tuncaulubilge I need to debug the code manually to know what's going on. Can you upload a sample project with your configuration?\n. Hi @tuncaulubilge right now you can't configure this value. But you can send a PR with this configuration if you want :)\n. Hi @rencsaridogan, thanks for your PR. I'm going to review it right now.\nI've noticed that your PR is breaking the checkstyle rules I've configured. Can you review the code and format it to match with the checkstyle? If you want to do it automatically you can use this project to configure your IDE: https://github.com/square/java-code-styles\n. Sorry for the delay @rencsaridogan, I've been out for some time. I think I can wait for the ExoPlayer example before to merge this PR. Please, if you have time add the example and the documentation needed to show how to use the new feature :)\n. Yeap @Shuhrat-java is right.\n. Sorry guys but this is the original behaviour of the library. As this is not a bug I'm closing the issue.\n. This library does not support landscape mode yet. As this issue is duplicated I'm closing it, sorry.\n. As pointed at #38 the bug is not related to the library, the bug is related to the YouTube player library. Sorry, I'm closing this issue.\n. You can send an evento to the future using a delay or send a pull request to add the events you need :)\n. Hi @tarunnoida!\nCould you review which is the order in the z index used by these fragments? Maybe just changing the z index used by these fragments we can fix the issue  :)\n. If that approach is not working you can try detecting when the keyboard is going to be shown and then change the size of the view or move the y position. Is this the answer to your question?\n. Hi @Taranlayal10 what my suggestion was to move the y position of the draggable pannel view, not invoking setYTopViewScaleFactor method. Sorry if I didn't explain my suggestion properly. Could you try changing the top value of the layout params associated to the draggable panel? Doing this you'll move the entire view Y position instead of change the top view scale factor.\n. Hi @mdtuyen to be able to do that we need to write some code. Review this file and modify the onTouchEvent:)\n. Hi @DawinderGill to be able to help you I need more information:\n- Version of the library you are using.\n- Layout configured using the library.\n- Code initializing the library.\n- Version of the Android SDK used to build the APK and the target sdk configured.\nThe easiest way for providing this information is to create a sample project reproducing the bug :)\n. Hi @prabhumallappa the landscape mode is not supported. The portrait gap you have between the top view and the bottom view has to be related to the bottom view margin or padding, please review it and tell me if that's your error or the problem is related to the library implementation.\n. Thanks @cog :)\n. Hi @billyjoker sorry for the delay, I've been working on other projects for some time. I can't see your example right now could you describe what's the problem you have with the fragment? Do you have any error or exception thrown by the SDK when the fragment is configured as retain instance state?. Hi @manhhoangxuan sorry for the late response. I've been working on other projects for some time. \nRemember you can adjust the height of your fragment and pin it to the top of your screen. You can also move the bar to the first layer of your UI so it's drawn in top of any other fragment. This last option depends on your bar implementation. \nIs this the answer to your question?. As I can see in your screenshot you have to adjust the fragment or the draggable view/ draggable panel height. You can use animations when needed.. @manhhoangxuan did you invalidate the view after calling that method?. @manhhoangxuan right now I'm working on a different project. I don't have a quick fix for this. Sorry. If you have time you can always send a PR with the fix. Any contribution is always welcome :). Hi @gkarthikchess this feature is not supported right now. It could be a nice contribution :). Hi @salvadorjhai sorry for the late response. You can configure your fragments easily using the methods indicated in the project README.md\njava\nprivate void initializeDraggablePanel() throws Resources.NotFoundException {\n      draggablePanel.setFragmentManager(getSupportFragmentManager());\n      draggablePanel.setTopFragment(placeFragment);\n      draggablePanel.setBottomFragment(mapFragment);\n      draggablePanel.initializeView();\n}. The feature you suggest it's not implemented right now. A workaround is to minimize the view when it's created and keep is as invisible until you want to show it. That will show you an animation and the view at the same time.. Hi @b00n12 thanks for your contribution!! Before to review the implementation and the correct behavior could you review the checkstyle errors you have? The build is failing because of this.. Hi @Shajeel-Afzal. Looking at your layout I can't see any obvious error. Could you create a sample project reproducing the issue so we can review what's going on? . @SarthakJoshi review other issues open in this repository. Depending on the video view you are implementing the library is going to resize it or not. There are some Android SDK APIs which doesn't support resize. Sorry I'm closing this issue because it's duplicated.. This old bug could be fixed changing how the view is being resized but I can't do it soon. Now I'm working on a different project.. You can enable the \"show layout bounds\" development option on your device and change the lib fixing the views overlap.. Hi @nitinrana, sorry for the late response. If you don't provide me more information about how to reproduce your bug, helping you is going to be really hard.\nI need this information:\n\nSteps to reproduce your bug. A gif or a video could be great.\nLibrary version being used.\nLibrary configuration in your project.\nLayout configuration in your project.\n\n It could be great if you can create a sample project reproducing the bug!. If I'm not wrong, this feature is not implemented. As you can see here, there is a flag you can enable or disable to configure the alpha effect applied during the horizontal drag. But the feature you request is not implemented. . @ceddyb you have methods to maximize the view. You should configure any view listener and invoke the maximize method when needed. I hope, this is the answer to your question.. Why have you changed X_MIN_VELOCITY, Y_MIN_VELOCITY and MINIMUN_DX_FOR_HORIZONTAL_DRAG? \n. Can you update README.md to remove the section related to how to install this dependency into your local maven repository?\n. In this project I'm not using \"m\" naming convention. Can you rename this variable name to clickToMaximize?\n. Please, move this constant declaration with the other one. Line 50. \nYou can rename it to MIN_SLIDING_DISTANCE or MIN_SLIDING_DISTANCE_ON_MINIMIZED_CLICK and remove the comment.\n. Don't you prefer: \"Return if user can maximize minimized view on click.\"\n. Don't you prefer isClickToMaximizeEnabled?\n. Remember to rename this method to setClickToMaximizeEnabled once mEnableClickToExpand be renamed.\n. Remove this space\n. Remove this empty lines, please.\n. Why don't you put this if condition into a method?\npublic boolean shouldMaximizeOnClick(MotionEvent ev, int deltaX, boolean isDragViewHit ...){\n   return (Math.abs(deltaX(<MIN_DISTANCE && isMinimized() && isClickToExpandEnabled && isDragViewHit ......;\n}\nWhit this your if will be more readable.\n. Please, don't use x1 and x2 as variable method. use lastTouchActionDownXPosition instead.\nReview also x2, you can reduce the scope to method level instead of class level, can't you?\n. Remove this line\n. Do you need this white line?\n. You don't need this variable. You can use isDragViewHit\n. Don't you prefer clickOffset as name?\n. The initial value of this variable should be false. This feature have to be disabled by default. Once you change this,  you have to create a method to enable this feature from DraggablePanel.\n. Don't you prefer to move this switch inside the else? and move all that code to a method?\nelse{\n   dragView.dispatchTouchEvent(cloneMotionEventWithAction(ev, MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL));\n   analyzeTouchToMaximizeIfNeeded();\n}\nor:\nelse{\n   dragView.dispatchTouchEvent(cloneMotionEventWithAction(ev, MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL));\n   if(shouldMaximizeOnClick(...)){\n       maximize();\n    }\n}\n. dragViewId and secondViewId are local variable and it has no sense to declare it as final variables. dragView and secondView are not declared as final because that attributes are instantiated when the layout is inflated and you can't use final modifier with an attribute if you don't initialize in the constructor.\n. Please, remove the \"[NEW]\" and keep the rest of the sentence. I'm going to add a CHANGELOG.md file with this information.\n. Don't let library clients to configure this parameter, this should be a constant.\n. If you add this xml attrs for draggable_view, provide the same implementation for DraggablePanel class, please.\n. Remove this attribute and use the constant.\n. As I've said before, this shouldn't be configurable. Please, remove this method.\n. Review this javadoc. This should be something like \"Enable or disable click to maximize view when dragged view is minimized\".\n. Review this javadoc. This should be something like \"Enable or disable click to minimize view when dragged view is maximized\".\n. Remove this attribute and this method and use the constant.\n. This method should be private.\n. You'll have to connect DraggablePanel configuration with DraggableView configuration as I'm already doing with other configurable attrs elements.\n. You'll have to remove this.\n. Yes\n. I'm talking about minSlidingDistanceOnClick\n. Yes :)\n. This doesn't compile. You can't use the same \"name\" for attributes used with DraggablePanel and DraggableView. Remember to update the README.md with the new attr name.\n. Oh my God, pay attention to your merges!!! Remove line 4, 6 and 9 please.\n. I don't have any message xD\n. No problem, but please, send me an email instead of use G+ or twitter. I hate G+. You have my email in the README.md\n. This repository doesn't use \"m\" notation. Please review your variables and rename them without the \"m\" prefix.\n. Here you have another variable with the \"m\" notation we should change.\n. You have a colors.xml file you should use to put this values there. Please, move this hardcoded values to colors.xml\n. You don't need this method, this variable should not be accessed out of this class.\n. The same with this method, you don't needed.\n. This method is not used\n. This method should use private visibility and not public. You are using it just from DraggableView.\n. You don't need to provide xml configuration for this variable, please remove this.\n. As I said in the other comment, you don't need to provide xml configuration for this new feature. Please, remove enable_touch_listener_panel and enable_touch_listener_view.\n. Don't you prefer this approach?\njava\nsetEnableTouchListener(slideOffset<=MIN_SLIDE_OFFSET);\n. Please, remove this part of the feature. The default behavior should be just move DraggablePanel out of the window. In addition you have a bug with this minimize call. Take a look to the video -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xkpTnF9BXjR0Q3NXVWclVkOTQ/view?usp=sharing\n. You have a typo in \"WHen\"\n. We need a better name for this attribute. Instead of enableTouchListener don't you prefer to use enableTouch and methods to enableTouch(boolean enableTouch) and isEnabled?\n. Instead of slideMinimizedView we should use slideHorizontally.\n. @ppamorim to fix the bug you can see in the video the only thing you have to do is use this implementation for slideMinimizedView(....). Take a look:\n``` java\npublic void slideHorizontally(float slideOffset, float drawerPosition, int width) {\n    float slide = Math.abs(drawerPosition);\n    if (slideOffset > MIN_SLIDE_OFFSET && !isClosed() && isMaximized()) {\n      minimize();\n    }\n    setEnableTouch(!(slideOffset <= MIN_SLIDE_OFFSET));\n    ViewHelper.setX(this, width - slide);\n  }\n```\n. mDrawerLayout left attribute still has the \"m\" notation!\n. This methods and this variable should be:\n``` java\nprivate boolean touchEnabled;\nprivate boolean isTouchEnabled(){\n     return this.touchEnabled;\n}\nprivate void setTouchEnabled(boolean touchEnabled){\n    this.touchEnabled = touchEnabled;\n}\n```\n. As I said in my previous comment where I attached you a video with a visual bug, your method implementation should be:\n``` java\npublic void slideHorizontally(float slideOffset, float drawerPosition, int width) {\n    float slide = Math.abs(drawerPosition);\n    if (slideOffset > MIN_SLIDE_OFFSET && !isClosed() && isMaximized()) {\n      minimize();\n    }\n    setEnableTouch(!(slideOffset <= MIN_SLIDE_OFFSET));\n    ViewHelper.setX(this, width - slide);\n  }\n```\nJust taking into account if the view is maximized or not you'll avoid this bug.\n. Do you need the parent of this DrawerLayout, if I'm not wrong you can remove it!\n. This is not \"black\" this is just transparent xD\n. hahaaha first time I hear this xD Nice to know :)\n. If you push a new commit in the pull request branch GitHub should update this pull request automatically.\n. This annotation has no sense. You are overriding this method from the Android SDK and is the Android SDK who is going to call this method. The contract specified in the onInterceptTouchEvent declaration says MotinEvent can't be null. Please, remove this annotation and the import.\n. This repository doesn't use \"m\" notation. Please rename this variable to activePointerId.\n. Remember to remove this annotation.\n. Why did you change this target sdk to api 19?\n. Can you use ' instead of \"?\n. We should change the naming of the methods you've added to match with the naming of the project. If you review the methods already implemented all start using on as prefix. Based on that, we should rename these last three methods to:\n``` java\nvoid onTouch()\nvoid onClickedToMaximize()\nvoid onClickedToMinimize();\nvoid onSmoothSlide();\n``\n. It could be useful to pass the event to the listener method.\n. Why do you process the touch event just if the configuration is portrait?\n. All this extra whitespace you have here and in the rest of the file will be gone if you format the project using the correct checkstyle.\n. @rencsaridogan this is not the way to go to implement the listener mechanism. You are using a polling mechanism to notify your listener and depending on the device this approach will notify at the second X or X+1. You should notify your listener close to the method where the alpha is modified and remove the usage of this count down timer.\n. Definitively this should be configurable. You should add aonlyPortraitflag in to theattrs.xml` file and use this value here.\n. Cool, thanks!\n. @rencsaridogan if you add an example to the project using exo player could be great. We could use it to improve the library usage combined with this component.\n. ",

    "ppamorim": "Why you need use Eclipse?\n. VideoPlayer extends SurfaceView, SurfaceView can't be transformed or resized. \nI recommend to change to TextureView.\nLook to this sample: https://github.com/ppamorim/DraggablePanel/tree/textureViewSample\n. @Fiddl3 Correct! I confuse me with resized and scaled.\nBut the scale of SurfaceView as some problems (black borders while dragging).\n. I've removed the surfaceView if my project because it cause some problems(black screen, resize/scale)\n. @Fiddl3 API 14 here :p\n. Fixed on #42, working now!\n. @Amritpal33, feature implemented. That deserves a round of beer. If you aren't of legal age, otherwise the juice round... :)\n. I'll work on it.\n. Like AndroidSlidingUpPanel:\nhttps://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel\nIt only can be possible when the view is maximized.\n. Well, I believe that the library name is DraggablePanel and not YoutubePanel...\nWe can be better than the Youtube itself.\nBut what's the need for it? Sometimes it's necessary to perform this resizing in some cases such as when the user will enter text in EditText without the keyboard being on top...\n. why?\n. Working now!\n. Hi @pedrovgs! I apologize for the bad sourcecode , made \u200b\u200bon the run because my time is very short. I'll do it better, of course.\n. @pedrovgs I'm from Brazil. My name is Pedro Paulo de Amorim\n. @pedrovgs Yup! I'm in the middle of two projects and I'm without much time . I think today I will take a little time to work on those changes , seriously ! : p\n. @pedrovgs But my internet connection is horrible. If all goes well , to implement an example in the sample containing the TextureView running a RTSP video.\n. Pushed! Can you review?\n. Good morning Pedro,\n- RTSP features removed\n- sample return to the base\n- build.gradle updated.\ncan you review?\n. @pedrovgs RTSP sample changed to textureViewSample branch.\n. @pedrovgs Done :p\n. I'm kind of stuck and tried to update my fork with yours, but do not know how to do ... :(\n. @pedrovgs Yeah!\n. Working on this checkstyle issues :+1: \n. :100: YEEP\n. We need implement a View helper only for the touch or disable the touch listener of youtube player, always when the view is minimized.\n. It's not a problem of library. It's a common problem when we've a view with a listener inside another view with a listener.\nLike a Google Maps inside a ViewPager. Google Maps = YoutubePlayer, ViewPager = DragView.\n. I think placing a View is a bad idea. I believe it is better to inform the developer that he must change / add another listener along with your YoutubePlayer. This covers various cases than implement a solution in the library.\nWhy? Because we don't know how to be the player of them.\n. @pedrovgs It's ok?\n. Oh my god, where's you?\n. @pedrovgs No problem, In the time, I'm working with this project inside of my app  (the project) and a maven central release isn't necessary now for me. \n. I fell out of my bed, I thought it was a dream.\n. Thanks!\n. Solved! Don't use the SurfaceView with this library, otherwise, I recommend to use the TextureView.\nSample: https://github.com/ppamorim/TextureView-Sample\n. If you want, I can remake this sample with the new Material Design UI. :)\n. I need to do this as it's a need of the app I'm working on...\n. ok\n. #57 to solve it\n. :( let's try again...\n. Blood are coming out of my eyes, but I'm working on it.\n. It's a different ideia. It will do a resize and rotate.\n. Good one!\n. #49 the same opened implementation.\n. Take a fork! I will not do it for you now.\n. @pedrovgs Yes. This feature (rotate to fullscreen) need to be implemented out of box. But use the same ideia/methods of #49.\n. @frakc Vitamio Player use SurfaceView. SurfaceView has problems with resize and transform operation. You need use TextureView for it. I'll report to Vitamio dev...\nThe problem is here:\nhttps://github.com/yixia/VitamioBundle/blob/master/vitamio/src/io/vov/vitamio/widget/VideoView.java\n. Please, study this branch:\nhttps://github.com/ppamorim/DraggablePanel/tree/textureViewSample\n. @bilalilyas90 SurfaceView... bro!\n. It's a common problem with this library.\nWe need start the view off screen (minimized and hide) and only expand this to maximized position.\n. I think it's. Becase another library have the same issue and I've do the same for to fix it...\n. It's a new features. That's allow to minimize to left, center or right position. And change the drag limit.\nI need change the readme too.\nDon't start the review until I tell you.\n. @pedrovgs Look to the line 676 on DraggableView class. I've change it (encapsulation), it can result a performance issue? If it can, I'll return to the original style.\n. @DuongNTdev Please remove your comment, do a fork and implement anythink that you want, then, open a pull request.\n. @pedrovgs Remember, it's a unstable code yet, but is the base of this animation. You can see this animation at Tv Shows Activity.\n. @pedrovgs Do you noticed any problem with ViewCompat.setPivotX? Here's a strange problem.\n\n. Yes, don`t use the class ViewCompat.\n. Yes!\nhttps://gist.github.com/ppamorim/c5a003495295cab9ae4b\n. You need to disable the touch listener of the DraggablePanel. I think this library has a method to do that.\n. Tested at a 6.0 device here. No problems. Would you inform the device that happens the problem? Hardly its a problem with the library, but the problem can be with the beta version of Android 6.0.\n. Its hard to identify the problem with this simple log. Do you have tried to use the sample app or implemented this library on your application?\n. This can be a problem with the beta release of the Android 6. Otherwise, try to use the sample application, if it works, wait for the stable version and test it.\nThis library use the most common way to perform these animations. We don't have any reason to happen this bug, we don't use any JNI code here.\n. @pedrovgs Where are you?\n. This is made by design, not a bug.\n. You need to do some workarounds to pervent this problem. I solved this on my app doing this: \n- Start the view hidden \n- Call to move to close to right \n- Only show the view only the method to expand the view is called.\n. why you not set these integers to final?\n. This is the standard that work. Changing...\n. ok\n. It's only to line 145?\n. lastTouchActionDownXPosition can't be a constant.\n. Only to getMinSlidingDistanceOnClick? Correct?\n. Opps...\n. I swear removed...\n. Done\n. Oh my God, I have not modified this guy : p\n. I've send a message to you on Twitter and Google+. Another questions...\n. https://plus.google.com/u/1/+PedroPauloAmorim\n. Forgive me, it's the first time I do a pull request: p\n. Old code, old standards. Will be changed.\n. Where's the problem?\nThe problem is that the developer has to put the DraggablePanel above the ActionBar/Toolbar, then this will not happen. As well as Youtube.\n. setEnableTouchListener is used on DraggablePanel.\n. It can be useful if user need now if touch is enable or not.\n. @pedrovgs It's black transparent. Exist a huge difference between white transparent and black transparent. It's used on gradient and influence on the colors of the element.\n. unecessary slide variable removed.\n. Changed, but github not notice that...\n. Yes, it updated the other notes , not this ...\n. My fault. Bad day...\n. Bad AS...\n. ",

It takes some time, but it can be done.\n. ...and if everything works well for you, that's the most effective way, but you have to make sure that app is working as supposed on all devices you targeting - that's the main goal \n. It's related to all view all which were not designed to move/resize/transform while rendering. But we can't do anything to improve this in library. \n. I had a similar problem with vitamio VideoView as dragView and resizeTransformer.\nSolution: Move methods responsible for changing a position of seconView to layoutChange listener of dragView.\nin DraggableView.mapGui()\n``` java\n...\nprivate void mapGUI(TypedArray attributes) {\n\n    final int dragViewId = attributes.getResourceId(R.styleable.draggable_view_top_view_id, R.id.drag_view);\n    final int secondViewId = attributes.getResourceId(R.styleable.draggable_view_bottom_view_id, R.id.second_view);\n    dragView = findViewById(dragViewId);\n    secondView = findViewById(secondViewId);\n\n    ViewTreeObserver observer = dragView.getViewTreeObserver();\n    observer.addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onGlobalLayout() {\n            changeSecondViewPosition();\n            changeSecondViewAlpha();\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n...\n```\nand comment in: DraggableViewCallback.onViewPositionChanged()\n``` java\n...\n@Override\npublic void onViewPositionChanged(View changedView, int left, int top, int dx, int dy) {\n    draggableView.updateLastDragViewPosition(top, left);\n\n    if (draggableView.isDragViewAtBottom()) {\n        draggableView.changeDragViewViewAlpha();\n    } else {\n        draggableView.restoreAlpha();\n        draggableView.changeDragViewScale();\n        draggableView.changeDragViewPosition();\n        //draggableView.changeSecondViewAlpha();\n        //draggableView.changeSecondViewPosition();\n        draggableView.changeBackgroundAlpha();\n    }\n}\n\n...\n```\nalso there is bug in DraggableView.smoothSlideTo(float slideOffset) \njava\n        int x = (int) (slideOffset * (getWidth() - transformer.getMinWidth()));\n        int y = (int) (topBound + slideOffset * getVerticalDragRange());\nshould be:\njava\n        int x = (int) (slideOffset * (getWidth() - transformer.getMinWidth() - transformer.getMarginRight()));\n        int y = (int) (topBound + slideOffset * getVerticalDragRange());\nand some in resize tranformer...\n. You need to create local copy of library (clone git repo), add it as module, add module dependency in grade (I'm using Android Studio), and modify java sources.\nIn eclipse create android library project, make changes, compile and add .jar to libs, of your project.\nChanges You need to make:\nIn Class:\nhttps://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/blob/develop/draggablepanel/src/main/java/com/github/pedrovgs/DraggableView.java#L334\nmodify/replace mapGUI (Copy&Paste from above answer)\nand in https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/blob/develop/draggablepanel/src/main/java/com/github/pedrovgs/DraggableViewCallback.java#L58\nadd comment in line 66&67, or replace whole onViewPositionChanged() from my prev answer\nSorry for my English, I hope You'll understand now.\n. You using ScaleTransformer which is default (seems more smooth, but not working with vitamio)... in ScaleTransformer view position is changed by ViewHelper.\nAdd brake point in addOnGlobalLayoutListener you implemented, and check whether it is fired\nIf not, you should reverse changes and study dragView & secondView positions while dragging, and in OnLayout https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/blob/develop/draggablepanel/src/main/java/com/github/pedrovgs/DraggableView.java#L308\nand check if positions are proper... \n. Can you share your code (Add whole project to Archive)? I'll take look and may be able to help.\n. mail.fiddle@gmail.com\n. I'll send pull request, but I have to test it more deeply\n. @pedrovgs I tried to explore why this issue occurs, but I haven't enough time to investigate this deeply, so, for now, i use temp fix with ViewTreeObserver and it works\nI made some other changes in library, take look https://github.com/Fiddl3/DraggablePanel/commit/b0f253eb76adc530dc01e6ec456e41265065d4f2\nI'll continue working on this when I'll have time, and send you a pull request... Maybe you'll resolve this issue earlier\n. @pedrovgs here is  updated sample app that I send to @manpreetsinghsodhi last week https://github.com/Fiddl3/DraggablePanel/commit/e6f64b6798bc5e3707ed2d991344d62b4a876d85\n. I don't have time to resolve all of your problems... especially if I don't know what is the problem...\nI suppose that video aspect ratio is different than dragView aspect ratio and part of video is cutoff (at bottom), the solution for this \"issue\" is to change dragView height programmatically to adjust it to video height \nThere is more problems to solve for example, when you drag YT player the video doesn't change its dimensions. There will be many more so You should teach yourself how to resolve them.\n. I deleted my prev answer by mistake....\nby default this is enabled, but you can\nIn java you can enable/disable apha effect:\ndraggablePanel.setEnableHorizontalAlphaEffect(true|false);\nor\ndraggableView.setHorizontalAlphaEffectEnabled(true|false);\nin XML:\ndraggable_view:enable_horizontal_alpha_effect=\"true|false\"\nfading of dragView is controlled by method changeDragViewViewAlpha() in draggableView\nThis will not work with Views that uses SurfaceView to display content (ex: video) because default PixelFormat of holder doesn't support alpha channel or support only one bit (visible/invisible)\nThere are 2 solutions:\n1) Change PixelFormat to one that support alphatransparency - http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PixelFormat.html#TRANSLUCENT\n2) Put View in container, set background of container, set visibility of View to INVISIBLE while moving\nI suppose YT player use SyfraceView too, but I'm not sure\n. in ~~triggerOnReleaseActionsWhileVerticalDrag()~~ method of DraggableViewCallback:\nedit:\nsorry in triggerOnReleaseActionsWhileHorizontalDrag()\n``` java\n...\n   if (xVel < 0 && xVel <= -X_MIN_VELOCITY) {//the mising \"-\" before (Y_MIN_VELOCITY) caused this bug\n        draggableView.closeToLeft();\n    }\n\n...\n```\n. It's because getMinHeightPlusMargin() in ResizeTransformer return different value than dimensions for   ~~verticalDragOffset ==1~~ verticalDragOffset ==0 in updateHeight()\nI don't remember if there was another issue causing this....\nResizeTransformer from my form works OK but resizeFactor work different than in original library\n. I'm sure @pedrovgs will fix it very quick \nyou can edit getMinHeightPlusMargin() to return the same value that is calculatet vile dragging\nI think it will be:\njava\nreturn (int) ((getOriginalHeight()* (1/getYScaleFactor())) + getMarginBottom());\nbut I'm not sure\n. I'll create new branch with fixes related to ResizeTransformer and send you a pull request.\n. I think I already hanged all variables to int, except for scaleTransformer, but I will review this again...\nThis evening (very late) or tomorrow.  With fixes for landscape mode You will have to wait, when I find some time to figure out how really Scale transformer works (for ResizeTransformer it works and this is what I needed for my project). \nI'm working on project which requires rtmp stream (flv [x264+speex]) playback and I having some issues with audio/video sync... It's nightmare....\n. It'll not work...\nint getMinWidthPlusMarginRight() \"margin part is missing\"\nI'll update my for (ResizeTransformer_fix branch) with all fixes (without changing a scaleFactor implementation) then send you a pull request later today.\nI still think that my scaleFactor implementation is better, but I don't know how many devs are using this library, and how many apps we \"broke\" when we will change this in maven central.... ergo lets leave this as is. \n. It's not working, look at the right side on the minimized dragView when you use minimize() method, there is no margin, so vertical dragging will not work.\n. There is no way for this to work ok... look in to smoothSlideTo() left coordinate is calculated using getMinWidthPlusMarginRight() so it'll be moved right by margin size.\nWhen you use finger to move view it'll work OK, but when you minimize it using minimize() or smoothSlideTo() it'll not\n. check my fork:\nhttps://github.com/Fiddl3/DraggablePanel/commit/c91dde454434a31f6e87a0794cd2212245c9bfa7\nI tested the library in my application, but you need to test this yourself \nif you target pre KitKat devices (API < 16) you need to handle window flags in activity\njava\n    @Override\n    public void onConfigurationChanged(final Configuration newConfig) {\n        super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);\n        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN){\n            if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {\n                getWindow().clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FORCE_NOT_FULLSCREEN);\n                getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);\n            } else {\n                getWindow().clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n. You are using DraggablePanel or DraggableView in your layout??\nI'll look in to it tomorrow, and test in sample app.\n. Tomorrow I'll work on this...\nI'm going to remove part responsible for hiding status and nav bars, because it's depend on API level, ant can be confusing for developers.\nThen I'll send pull request .\nEDIT:\nI'll add xml attribute for auto fullscreen mode.\n. There will be one problem... \nIn my version scaleFactor work differently. drag view is scaled to 1/scaleFactor of its original size. now only for scaleFactor=2 it match your calculations (In last commit I accidentally reverted changes in scaleTransformer).\nThis may be confusing for devs who use the library, but I think that this approach (for calculation) makes more sense (its more logical)\n. No problem.\nI'll email you, but not today. \nThere was a \"small\" party last night and... I can't think straight right now.\n. draggable_view_top_view_y_scale_factor should be set as float value, not dimesion, \n. I'm working on fullscreen support for ResizeTransformer on this branch: https://github.com/Fiddl3/DraggablePanel/tree/LanscapeMode-feature.\nIt's synchronized with develop, you can clone this branch and make your changes.\n. Now I'm working on my engineering degree (Home automation project) and I don't have any time for this. I hope in second half of February this'll change. \n. Travis say Could not find com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.2. xD \nThere is no support library on maven central (I think is in local repo, when you install android google support libs via SDK Manager) \n. MINIMUN_DX_FOR_HORIZONTAL_DRAG typo in MINIMU``N word \n...MIN_VELOCITY - I've tested various values and this to works ok for me, Y_MIN_VELOCITY was too high for landscape mode. \n. hmmmm.... I'm thinking MINIMUM_DX & MINIMUM_DY should be density dependent...\n. Whats wrong there? I don't know where I should look \n. aaa I see, second view content is missing, I'll take look at this\n. travis doesn't like me & lastest google support library....\nTravis downloads and installs support library, but then it doesn't see it... https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/builds/43138658#L935\n. No problem :) \nI'll continue working on lanscape support when I'll have time\nI'm Rafa\u0142 Pluta\n. This project is still in dev stage, I still have problems with rtmp stream playback...\n. I will, thanks.\n. This happens to me too on some devices... \nI don't think this is bug in DraggableView, but there is simple solution - check pointerCount and if count > 1 return false :\n``` java\n  @Override public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {\n  ...\nif (action == MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL || \n    action == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP  || \n    ev.getPointerCount() > 1) {\n  viewDragHelper.cancel();\n  return false;\n}\n\n...\n  }\n``\n. You can always catch exception and return false but you should debugViewDragHelper.shouldInterceptTouchEvent()` method because it appears that MotionEvent is changing in for loop and this cause exception, because before loop PointerCount must be grater than 1, but in second pass of for loop NullPointerException appears in line :\njava\nfinal float dx = x - mInitialMotionX[pointerId];\n. please try this branch https://github.com/Fiddl3/DraggablePanel/tree/viewDragHelper_issue if it fix this bug I'll create pull request\n. For now I'm using try...catch to silence this exception, but I really don't know why it is happening even with new instance on event...\n. You can try extend DraggableView class and override public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) and return false when user touch mediaController view.\nBut i discovered that this will produce NullPointerException in ViewDragHelper class similar to #31. \nGenerally if other view take over a MotionEvent the shouldInterceptTouchEvent method will throw NullPointerException or OutOfBoundsException at some point....\n. can you upload a video showing this problem?\n. Are You using regular Android VideoView or custom view?\n. Look in to sample app, there is example with YT player (but with outdated library) and it's working\n. Did You try set right & bottom margin for draggableview? I don't know where yt player view is overlaped and I don't have time to investigate this right now, but I'll take look in to this in future.\n. I don't understand...\n``` java\ndraggablePanel.setTopFragmentMarginRight(topViewMarginRight);\ndraggablePanel.setTopFragmentMarginBottom(topViewMargnBottom);\n```\ndoesn't work if you are using ResizeTransformer ??\nAnd which view is overlaping YT player? or is it positioned outside the screen? \n. this is the patch\nAlways set layout bounds except edit mode\n.

I saw comments saying it works fine with youtubeplayerview, but i dont know how to use youtubplayerview inside fragment and it is actually said that this view can be used only in activity extending YoutubeBaseActivity\n. @Fiddl3  If you mention this example\nhttp://oi58.tinypic.com/2mos0i0.jpg  you can see that video is cropped at right and bottom ( it also visible in readme of this project. \nMay be you have any idea about this problem? https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/issues/38\nIt is resized properly, but due to few pixels overlapping it stops by crual youtubeplayer developers' logic/\nFrom you words, I assume that this issue was fixed at some point, but later it was accidentaly reverted\n. @Fiddl3  I tried. margins in dagable pannel does not affect the distance between topview and bottom view. Those view are adjecent if scaleTransformer is used and there is few pixel overlaping if ResizeTransformer is used.\n. Solved\nCorrect way to initialise is \njava\n initializeYoutubeFragment();\n        hookDraggablePanelListeners();\n        initializeDraggablePanel();\nContradictory to sample\n. @pedrovgs  but main problem - resize transformer causes youtubefragment to be few pixel under some view, which make youtube player to stop, as anything is not allowed to be above it\n. @pedrovgs  screenshoot\nAs You can see if you magnify image, video fragme is slightly overlaped a bottom\n. @pedrovgs \nYes, I am using last library version. \nquot from google dev https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/reference/com/google/android/youtube/player/YouTubePlayerFragment?hl=ru \"Note that while videos are playing, this View has a minimum size of 200x110 dp. If you make the view any smaller, videos will automatically stop playing. Also, it is not permitted to overlay this fragment's view with other views while a video is playing. \"\nAnd if you will try to put any overlay to youtubeplayerview or youtubeplayerfragment you will see that it is true - video will stop plaing in 2 second if overlay vill not move out of youtubeplayer bounds.\nAlso in last line of error log in topic body, you will see distances with negative numbers which point to overlaping. \nI also tried to point it on this image, do you see that top view is just few pixels below bottomview?\nhttp://oi61.tinypic.com/2vv8dw5.jpg\n. besides overlappind, there also was issue with minimal player size for YouTubePlayerSupportFragment,which is limited to 200*110 dp. I fixed it in following way:\nAt first wrap frame which will hold youtube fragment and add top and bottom padding\n``` xml\n \n        <FrameLayout\n            android:id=\"@+id/youtube_here\"\n            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n\n            android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n        </FrameLayout>\n    </FrameLayout>\n\n```\nthen\nchange updateScale method in resizetransformer to\n``` java\n  @Override public void updateScale(float verticalDragOffset) {\n    int newWidth = (int) (getOriginalWidth() * (1 - verticalDragOffset / getXScaleFactor()));\n    int newHeight = (int) (getOriginalHeight() * (1 - verticalDragOffset / getYScaleFactor()));\n    if(newWidth>minX)layoutParams.width = newWidth;\n    if(newHeight>minY)layoutParams.height = newHeight;\ngetView().setLayoutParams(layoutParams);\n\n}\n```\nand constructor to\n``` java\n  private int minX,minY;\n  ResizeTransformer(View view, View parent) {\n    super(view, parent);\n    layoutParams = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams();\n    minX = (int) TypedValue.applyDimension(\n        TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 210, view.getContext()\n        .getResources()\n        .getDisplayMetrics()\n    );\n    minY = (int) TypedValue.applyDimension(\n        TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 114, view.getContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics()\n    );\n}\n```\nthat will ensure that player will not be smalle then minimal dimentions and will not be overlaped by bottom fragment\n. @ppamorim \nHi. Do you need any help with this feature? (dont know how much i can help, but I need this feature too)\n. @bilalilyas90 \n``` java\n    @Override\n    public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {\n        super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);\n    if(getResources().getConfiguration().orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {\n        Display\n                display =\n                VideoSampleActivity.this.getWindowManager()\n                             .getDefaultDisplay();\n\n        Point size = new Point();\n        display.getSize(size);\n        draggableView.setTopViewHeight(size.y);\n\n        Toast.makeText(VideoSampleActivity.this, \"landscape\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)\n             .show();\n    } else if(getResources().getConfiguration().orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {\n        Toast.makeText(VideoSampleActivity.this, \"portraite\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)\n             .show();\n\n        Resources r = getResources();\n        int px = (int) TypedValue.applyDimension(\n                TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 200, r.getDisplayMetrics()\n        );\n        draggableView.setTopViewHeight(px);\n\n\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThat actually works good for draggableView. For draggablePannel need to add extra method to pass height directly to view.\n. @bilalilyas90  try this tweak \nhttps://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/issues/29\nI did not tested it by myself but i hope it will help\n. @bilalilyas90  try to replace your player with standart videoview. If behaviour consistent - it sum internal bug, if not - contact your payer developers as it might be part of player protection ( like in youtube, which stops when view overlaping is detected)\n. @bilalilyas90 sorry i am unexpirienced with draggablepanel and vitamio,  I simply dont have any idea\n. @HagerMagdy \nIts because of minimise check\njava\nif(slideOffset > MIN_SLIDE_OFFSET && !isClosed() && isMaximized()) {\n            minimize();\n        }\nyou can ither edit way of minimise check or check orientation to perform or not perform some actions\njava\nif(getResources().getConfiguration().orientation == Configuration .ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)\n. it is something with check style, How to use checkstyle plugin?\nBuy the way, does resize transformer work at all (when i doenloaded demo and run on my tablet (android 5.02, it freesed)? Cause I have another commit which gratly improve positioning with scale transfromer and probably will brake resize transformer.\n. @pedrovgs Horray, it finaly passed:) You probably has to validate if there is negative impact on recize transformer, as i could not, on version 1.8 it always freees on my devices\n. @pedrovgs also check you checkstyle for <module name=\"RedundantThrows\"/>  it seems, that check style does not support it any more. loading checkstyle file with it causes loading crash\n. ",
    "tuncaulubilge": "@vuhung3990 I had the same bug with height not resizing properly. I'm also using a custom player but I doubt the problem is with the player. It seems like the issue occurs when I manually set the height in code, in order to keep aspect ratio. Can you confirm this is the case for you too?\nIssue: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/issues/84\n. Any luck?\n. Had the same problem, solved it by moving the fragment to the parent layout:\n```\n    @Override public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration configuration) {\n        super.onConfigurationChanged(configuration);\n        if (configuration.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {\n            View playerView = playerFragment.getView();\n            playerParent = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.drag_view);\n            playerParent.removeView(playerView);\n            draggablePanel.addView(playerView, playerView.getLayoutParams());\n        } else if (configuration.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {\n            View playerView = playerFragment.getView();\n            draggablePanel.removeView(playerView);\n            playerParent = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.drag_view);\n            playerParent.addView(playerView, playerView.getLayoutParams());\n        }\n    playerFragment.onOrientationChanged(configuration.orientation);\n}\n\n```\n. Could you find any solutions to this issue? Tried several methods but no luck\n. @ppamorim Any suggestions on how to change this? I can fork your project for this feature.\n. Found an ugly but working solution for this issue.\nThe trick is, the draggableView has to be visible when you call minimize(). In my layout, I made draggableView visible with both drag views invisible. \nWhen the draggableView global layout is called, I minimize the view and set it to invisible again in a delayed runnable. This way, when I want to display the views with maximize, the animation plays from bottom to top. \nHere is the code:\nplayerView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(\n                new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\n                    @Override public void onGlobalLayout() {\n                        // gets called after layout has been done but before display\n                        playerView.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(this);\n                        playerView.minimize();\n                        Handler handler = new Handler();\n                        handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n                            @Override public void run() {\n                                playerView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n                                playerView.setChildViewsVisible();\n                            }\n                        }, 10);\n                    }\n                });\nAfterwards, when I want to display the player, I just set it to VISIBLE and call maximize()\n.

    "rencsaridogan": "@pedrovgs I've implemented a change for anyone to be able to choose any rotation they like for the panel to work (Default is all), implemented the changes and applied the improvements we've discussed. ExoPlayer example is not added yet, working on that to prepare the best example to work on. \nAfter the review you can merge this without waiting the example version. After the fixes and improvements it shouldn't effect the current version anyhow. Instead it should be adding the new features.\nBest regards,\nRen\u00e7 Sar\u0131do\u011fan.\n. In case of usage a video player such as ExoPlayer, this processes the drag event when you try to hover the player controls, breaks the user experience about controlling the player. A control has been added for that purpose. Could be optional for people who doesn't have hover for player controls and aims to drag even on Landscape.\n. Working on it.\n. I'll be formatting the code with the correct checkstyle along with the other changes.\n. You are right. Since the alpha is modified constantly in that case, removing the extra timers and handling the notifiers within the alpha change sounds logical. I'll be implementing and testing that version. Thanks!\n. @pedrovgs While I'm coding the changes through, I will add a sample for ExoPlayer along with others for the purpose of improving usage of both components together. I believe since industry is focused on using ExoPlayer based players, so this could be great to give it a full support!\n. @pedrovgs I thought it is better to give all the options (all, landscape, portrait) for the user, in case of different needs I'll be adding a flag to support all of those to trigger touch events. You can check it out after the commit with new implementations.\n. ",
