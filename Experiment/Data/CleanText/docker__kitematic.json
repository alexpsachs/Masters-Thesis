Fixing it up right now :)\nYou're also free to follow our status on hot fixes on Twitter.\nhttps://twitter.com/kitematic\n. Fixed in pull request #27 \n. Hey, thanks for letting me know about the issue! Looking into it right now :) You can also try to restart Kitematic app to see if it works for you after that.\n. Thanks! Really sorry about the app being a bit flaky at the moment. Still ironing out the bugs during Beta. Really appreciate the help.\n. Fixed in pull request #27 \n. Thanks Justin!  Merged. :)\n.

Sorry @Jolg42 , will look into this issue again.\n. LGTM.\n. Thanks for helping out @Gurpartap :)\n. Sorry about this. Been cleaning up some packages and left this one out by accident. You can try typing \"meteor remove octicons\" in the meteor directory to see if that fixes it.\n. Hey @floodedcodeboy, thank you so much for sending us the logs. We think we found what's causing that problem. Fixing it up right now :)\n. It looks like an error caused by us not handling older versions of VirtualBox properly. Really sorry about this. We're uploading a patched version right now.\n. It's done uploading. Give it a try and definitely let me know if anything is breaking still :) Thanks!\n. Sweet! No problem! :D Yeah, the Virtualbox processes (4 in total) seem to linger around sometimes.\n. LGTM.\n. Hey @mkempster, which version of the Kitematic app are you using? I might've released a fix for the problem in v0.2.3\n. Hey @mkempster, that sounds like a great idea, I ran into that a couple of times myself and my computer becomes slow. I'll look into how to add this to the app.\n. Hey @mkempster , definitely something we're looking into, fixing up the naming of images as well.\n. Hey @bortels , it's definitely something we're looking into right now, trying to figure out the best way to design and fit it in the current workflow.\n. Hey @Peeja , looking into this problem right now, in the meantime, you can try clicking the \"Repair Kitematic\" button in the settings page to see if that'll fix it for you.\n. So sorry guys, thanks for all the helpful info! Looking into this problem right now.\n. LGTM.\n. Hi Peter,\nAs for the whole mess of apps, some of them are \"zombie\" containers that got created in the background and never been deleted. Previous versions of Kitematic doesn't notice apps created on the Docker host (had to create through the GUI). With the current version of Kitematic, the Docker host is fully transparent to you, so you can manage your resources properly and delete the apps you don't want.\nSorry about the confusion. The app is still very early and there might be some backward incompatible changes. Definitely feel free to reach out to us if you need more help with the app.\n. @Peeja The Kitematic app tries to restart containers that are shutdown (red apps), because we want to restart all the apps that are dead after the Docker host dies or the computer is restarted. Some containers don't have a prolonged command to run (like a running server) and that's why they kept turning red after the command is executed. \n. Thanks for the suggestions @nathanleclaire! :)\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. \n. Awesome! LGTM!\n. Super awesome! LGTM!\n. Thanks for helping out @DieterReuter !\n. @allen-servedio I think that's a pretty cool idea. It will definitely improve the \"content\" side of the design for developers. Imagine you can view a well formatted and syntax highlighted Dockerfile right from the app. It would be nice if we can figure out a way together to keep things super simple while are introducing new contents as well :)\n. Thanks @DieterReuter this is a really good idea :+1: \n. Hi @marcinwyszynski, Ubuntu image is a base OS image which is used in other images, but doesn't technically \"run\" as a prolonged process.\n. This is super cool @koddsson! Thanks for adding this. I'll give this a try :)\n. Great work @domderen! Thank you so much for helping us with Windows :+1: \n.

Biggest problem is Window resizing feels buggy.\n. This is awesome! Let's merge it :)\n. Thank you so much for submitting this PR! This is fixed in #935 \n. Ah, didn't know Hub 2.0 uses a different URL. Will fix it now. Thanks for the issue!\n. LGTM!\n. Duplicate #935 \n. Haha nice. This is pretty cool!\n. Thanks @FrenchBen. This is looking good! \nWe should improve upon Hub and make an even better image browsing experience on Kitematic to improve the experience of using Docker overall.\nMy suggestions on the UX:\n1. Infinite scroll is preferred more than page selectors. Since our users are \"browsing\" images, we'd want them to have a similar experience to most websites such as Pinterest, Facebook etc.\n2. If infinite scroll is challenging or has performance issues, we can fallback to page selector. I think the page selector component can simply stay at the bottom of the page rather than fixed at the bottom. When users scroll down, they can already see that there are more pages.\n3. There is no reason to limit the number of pages shown to only 3 (we can bump up the number or use a pattern similar to Google's page selector). One advantage to having page selector is quick access to memorized page numbers.\n4. The page selector no longer disappears when the page is loading on Hub. If we are using page selector, Kitematic will feel much more smooth and slick if the selector doesn't appear and reappear when pages are loading.\n. @ClemMakesApps I like this idea. This would work if we move the ID field before NAME, remove the textbox underline on the ID field and remove the border of the COPY button to clearly show that this is a different field than the rest.\n. This is awesome. Thanks @ClemMakesApps ! +1\n. You are welcome @alicetoreno :)\n. @jeffdm tried to keep the name consistent with the other disable methods, should I change the name of everything else?\n. ",

A few of the binaries included like unison would need to be swapped out for a linux version. Some of the file paths would need to be updated as well. I'll follow up with more details once some of the pressing bugs (installer!) are patched.\nBest part about Linux is no requirement on VirtualBox :)\n. Wow! Awesome demand for Linux :smiley: \nQuestions for everyone regarding Linux support:\n- Would .deb and .rpm packages be best (similar to Atom)?\n- Would it make sense to run the Docker daemon on the Linux host itself? Or using some sort of virtualization via QEMU-KVM or VirtualBox paravirtualization (coming in VBox 5.0)?\n. We're switching out MongoDB in a future release so the app will be cleaner & leaner.

This can usually be fixed with a refresh (CMD+R)\nLooking into what may be causing this now.\n. This should be fixed. @flyingzl sorry to hear that. What error or failure are you seeing with 0.2.3?\n. VirtualBox may still be running for other reasons, but we can probably kill VBoxHeadless for the Kitematic VM when the app shuts down.\n. Thanks! Will be merging in something like this soon under the scripts folder or as a script included in the .app bundle.\n. Fixed in 0.5. Just remove the Kitematic.app file and the ~/Users/<username>/Library/Application\\ Support/Kitematic directory and you're done.\nIf you want to completely wipe everything (Kitematic, VirtualBox, all your VMs) you can use ./util/reset\n.

Added in 0.5 - search for images in the Docker Hub registry\n. Yes we opted to remove the DNS for a few reasons:\n- Added complexity of shipping a DNS server with Kitematic\n- DNS queries would sometimes take time to resolve and were often spotty on Chrome\n- Using Port mapping is much closer to native Docker workflows\n. Since we can no longer add hosts I think it's best to close this thread. That said, I'd love to know any ideas or feedbacks on the current Port mapping implementation.\n.

I just was able to reproduce this. Looking into what's going on now. As for what happens in the installer:\nEssentially we:\n1) Set up VirtualBox if it's not installed\n2) Set up boot2docker & run boot2docker init & upgrade (but use a different vm called kitematic-vm)\n3) Add a file to /etc/resolver/kite to forward *.kite dns requests to 172.17.42.1 (the docker bridge)\n4) Set up routing from 172.17.0.0/16 to 192.168.60.103 so the docker bridge is accessible to your mac\n5) Download ubuntu:14.04 and a kite-dns image which takes care of handling dns requests to the docker bridge\n. No problem! Glad we could help. Sorry for the delay on this.\nThanks for chiming in @mkempster. :+1:  Agreed! Vim and screen should be in your default images! We've switched docker-enter/nsenter to use docker exec and fixed a bug w/ opening terminals so things work better there too.\nClosing for now.\n. Thanks! Do you mean include Kitematic with common package managers such as homebrew?\n. Kitematic 0.5 now uses npm install for setup and npm run to start the app in development. Things should be working out of the box.\nFeel free to re-open the issue if this isn't what you meant :)\n. This should be fixed in the next release, by #372 \nClosing for now :-) Thanks!\n. Wow! This definitely wasn't intended. Did this occur during the install? Kitematic periodically runs this command to check the status of the VM so it's possible it just hangs.\nSorry about that, we should kill this process within a few seconds (5) if it doesn't answer.\n. Eeek. Sorry to have ruined your Skype call. Looking into this.\n. Sorry for the delay.\nThis will be changed to use Volume mounts (VirtualBox Shared Folders) instead of Unison for Kitematic 0.4.\n.

too. As of the next release (Kitematic 0.4) we'll be changing the IP to the boot2docker default (192.168.59.x) so it's accessible even when connected to common VPNs. Sorry about this.\n\n@batizhao Kitematic 0.4 removes the requirement for 'default images' so you won't need s3 connectivity after the download. On the last step of the installer we download some default Docker images (including ubuntu) saved on S3 so that would explain why the last step is stuck or fails.\nHope this helps guys, both these issues should be fixed in 0.4. Thanks for reporting :smiley: :+1: \n. Thanks so much for reporting!\nboot2docker may be somehow picking up kitematic-vm as the default vm. We chose 192.168.60.103 specifically to avoid collision with boot2docker which assigns IP addresses in the 192.168.59.* range using DHCP.\nWhat does running boot2docker info show?\nFor example, I get this.\n```\n\u25b6 boot2docker start\nWaiting for VM and Docker daemon to start...\n.............ooo\nStarted.\nWriting /Users/jmorgan/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/ca.pem\nWriting /Users/jmorgan/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/cert.pem\nWriting /Users/jmorgan/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/key.pem\nTo connect the Docker client to the Docker daemon, please set:\n    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376\n    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/jmorgan/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm\n    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\n```\n. Fixed in v0.4.0, this version will remove the kitematic-vm and use the regular boot2docker-vm.\nThanks for reporting :+1: and sorry for the delay.\n. Reopening this since it's occurring often. Diving in for a fix, thanks for the comments all.\n. This is resolved in v0.4.0, where Kitematic will dynamically fetch the IP of the linux vm on every boot.\n. Fixed in v0.4.0\n. Fixed in 0.5\n. No need to modify the Dockerfiles. As for the hanging, I'm testing this out locally. Thanks for reporting :+1: \n. I've confirmed the bug:\n\nThe reason the \"+\" doesn't appear is that we flag any Dockerfile without an EXPOSE directive to be a 'base-image'. This is a mistake we'll fix in the next release.\nIn the meantime here's a fork of JSDetox with the EXPOSE 3000 directive added: https://github.com/jeffdm/docker/tree/master/jsdetox/Dockerfile\nThe Viper API could use the same change.\nHTTPIE looks like a CLI tool which Kitematic doesn't support yet, but we're looking in how to best support these. Any thoughts?\nThanks again :smiley: \n. This Dockerfile seems to work for me (added the EXPOSE 3000 directive in the Dockerfile):\nhttps://github.com/jeffdm/docker/tree/master/jsdetox/Dockerfile\nDoes this Dockerfile work for you?\nThanks :+1: \n. :+1: Great to hear. I'll keep this open for now for Kitematic 0.4\n. Sounds like a great idea - open a shell for apps that don't expose ports.\nI think there's a few fine-grained Docker features, such as volumes-from and container linking that limit the scope of which batch job / terminal apps we can support at the moment. I'll open a new ticket around CLI / TTY apps.\n. Thanks again for reporting this. Merging this issue with #115.\n. 0.5 includes support for containers without open ports.\n. Sorry about the trouble the *.kite hosts. Keep an eye out for a fix! It's on the way.\nThanks for reporting the issue.\n. Fixed in v0.4.0\n. Closing in favor of #231 to keep things in one place, but thanks for all the input!\n. Fixed in 0.4.0\n. :+1:  Thanks for creating the issue!\n. Fixed in 0.5\n. Thanks for the issue!\nI can't seem to reproduce the problem. If I close Kitematic then run boot2docker up I get the same result than if the VM was just powered off. What steps can I run to reproduce this?\nThanks! :smiley: \n. Added switch in 0.5 settings!\n. Sorry for the delay on this.\nWe've updated Kitematic 0.5 to use machine. It's possible the conflict still exists but it's worth a try.\n. Thanks for the update - sorry for hte delay.\nThis is a duplicate of #254 - closing\n. Fixed in 0.5\n. Fixed in 0.5\n. Thanks for the contribution, @schmunk42! This feature's been added upstream as we've changed the foundation of the app from Meteor to React.js:\nSee https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/src/ImageCard.react.js\nThanks again.\n. Thanks! :smiley: \nShould be fixed in 0.5 (cannot reproduce), but feel free to re-open!\n. Fixed in 0.5, where we phased out creation time for other details (like status, tags). Feel free to re-open.\n. Fixed in 0.5! Kitematic now syncs all container state with the CLI\nThe only containers that won't be shown are ones created from images without tags. These are probably intermediate containers that exist due to the build process.\n. Fixed in 0.5! This was turned off by default but can be re-enabled in the app settings.\n. Fixed in 0.5\n. Fixed in 0.5\n. This should be fixed with 0.5.10.\nThat said, note that Kitematic won't automatically pick up an existing boot2docker setup (we recently switched to using docker-machine.\n. This was fixed in 0.5. Anything done on CLI is reflected in Kitematic now :smile:\nNote that 0.5 now uses machine. We even have a little terminal button in the bottom-left of the app you can use to open a docker-ready terminal on your mac. \nThat said, you can't directly important from a boot2docker vm yet via machine, there's a ticket open for that IIRC. Look out for this soon!\nJeff\n. @RandomMaker thanks for the feedback\n. LGTM!! AWESOME!\n. LGTM! :shipit: \n. Thanks\n. LGTM\n. The app is entirely self-contained except for:\n- Downloading & Installing VirtualBox if you don't have it already\n- Copying the latest docker and docker-machine binaries to /usr/local/bin for convenience. But I agree this isn't very transparent.\nWe'll make this more clear on the download page. Thoughts? Thanks for the issue!\n.  :+1: Thanks for reporting this!\nSeems like many of the official hub repositories such as mysql or redis run the db process as a separate user, which won't have access to a mounted volume.\nIt seems like a quick fix here is just to add the ability to disable a container's volume. Keep an eye out for a fix!\n. :+1 Wrong wording on my part! Sorry! I meant adding away to disable the host binding altogether.\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Tue, Mar 3, 2015 at 12:33 PM, Sebastiaan van Stijn\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@rmb938 :+1: alright!

That comment should be a blog post post somewhere :smiley: \n. ETA for 0.5.11 is Friday. Sorry again in a delay with the update\n. Fixed in #340. Cutting a release for 0.5.11 today\n. Sorry I wasn't more specific: it's more of a fix for databases where you don't really need access to the volumes. It defaults the volumes to be 'non-host mounted' and if you click the directory icon then it mounts them and lets you unmount them in the settings.\n\n\n@danielchatfield which docker image are you using? I feel like this should still work for you. E.g. only enable the wordpress volume and don't enable the mysql one.\n. @g12n it was a quick fix so they at least work out of the box :smiley:. It's still work in progress. That said, this is obviously not a fixed issue so I'll re-open it.\n@DominicBoettger Sorry about this. The volumes won't work if you open them in Kitematic or choose/mount a Mac directory for now because of VirtualBox shared folders. Still working on a fix.\n. If you run a container in the latest version (0.5.13) and do not click the edit files folder icons or map any volumes in the container settings it should work.\nSorry the UX isn't the greatest - we're still working out a better solution to this.\n. Thanks @rmb938. Do you mean private hub repositories or private registries?\n. Maybe this can shed some light on the error you're seeing, @dskyberg http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26710153/remote-access-to-a-private-docker-registry\n. Focusing this issue on private registries, for private DockerHub repos, please see #232 \n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Just pushed a change to fix this - sorry about that. Pull & try again and it should work!\n. This is a tough bug. It's usually due to an error in VirtualBox. The following command may fix this:\ndocker-machine rm -f dev\nThen running Kitematic again. If it persists, try installing the latest VirtualBox and trying again. This should clear out the error.\nThis has happened to a couple people now, so I'm eager to know what works. Please let me know! Thanks for filing the issue.\n. Are you on a VPN? What's the output if you run docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 2048 dev -D  (with the -D flag)?\n. Thanks for filing an issue! We'll need to check for these in the image before running it and let the user know.\n. Hi all. Thanks for creating this issue!\nThe good news is that we use docker-machine under the hood, which is quickly adding support for different providers such as VMware fusion etc.\nI'll mark this as a feature for adding different providers, but also understanding that it's inconvenient to automatically install VirtualBox if that's not what's expected.\n. @jchannon Hah! Loved this comment. Thanks for the feedback :smiley: \n. @jchannon Right now we're working to nail the (default) virtualbox experience but this is strongly in demand.\nThat said, this is strongly in demand. Both so KM users can deploy an app to a cloud server or use alternative Desktop virtualization system.\n. Hey all - thanks for the issue and feedback.\nThis feature depends on the ability to login / signup before it can be implemented.\nOnce hub login / signup is merged this should be relatively straightforward via Registry.js. Keep an eye out for work around this. It's our highest priority feature!\n. Great! Thanks for the issue!\n. Hi there. Thanks for the issue.\nOur README.md file has instructions on uninstalling - they haven't quite made it to the docs yet.\n. The code for shutting down the VM was refactored in 0.5.11 and after a bunch of testing I couldn't reproduce this. Marking it as closed for now, but feel free to reopen.\n. Thanks for reporting this - the integration with docker machine isn't quite perfect yet, sorry about that. We're hard at work on it. Some gotchas we've seen:\n- Corporate VPN blocking access to 192.168.x.x\n- Make sure you have VirtualBox 4.3.x installed (Kitematic will use your existing VBox or install the latest)\nUsually the best way is to restart (i.e. remove the vm and start Kitematic again).\n. @argan if you run:\n- docker-machine ssh dev\n- docker ps\nThis will check that the VM is up and Docker is running inside. Does this work?\nThanks for the note\n. @argan thanks for the info!\nDeleting the VM seems to solve the problem, though it's not a great solution. Some machine related fixes should come in docker-machine 0.2.0 and then we'll deep dive from there!\n. @argan I don't think so :smiley: Though it seems like having two VMs sometimes causes issues. Looking into this.\n@ruprict sorry to hear that! If you run docker-machine ssh dev, are you able to ssh into the VM once it's started? Does it show any kind of error? Is it the port '0' error? I'll keep an eye on the docker-machine issue you linked to\n. I see. Thanks @ruprict. Sorry about that\n. @pixeldrew thanks!!\nInteresting, the host adapters seem to be related\ncc @ehazlett @nathanleclaire\n. This should be fixed in 0.5.18 as we no longer need to download boot2docker.iso\n. Awesome to hear @destec! This seems fixed - closing.\n. @yakovkhalinsky is correct in that Kitematic will read the EXPOSE directives of the Dockerfile as which ports to open.\nUnfortunately the only solution right now is to modify the Dockerfile and re-push it to the hub.\n. It's not currently on the roadmap but definitely a requested feature.\nThat said we don't have an issue yet for it, but feel free to create one! Thanks @dlimanov !\n. Thanks @lennyzeltser !\n. Thank for the issue.\nIt looks like this version of docker-machine is not the same as the one Kitematic downloads on npm install.\nWould it be possible to clone the repo, run npm install and paste the output here?\n. Fixed this on master. Sorry about that - the initial npm install would accidentally remove docker-machine after downloading it.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for creating an issue! We keep them now in case you want to re-use the files, but I understand how that can leave a bunch of \"leftovers\". Would it make sense to delete the files if the container is explicitly deleted?\n. Ah - that's a good idea. Thanks for the input on how to make this better.\n. Thanks for the issue :smiley:\nApp data (like the sqlite database for localStorage) is in ~/Library/Application Support/Kitematic.\nThat said, only container volume data is placed in the created directory ~/Kitematic for easy access to volume data. Where do you feel makes the most sense for host-mounted container volume data?\n. Good suggestion. It's what VirtualBox and VMware Fusion use. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the issue and your specific use case! This seems to be a duplicate of #209. Closing for now\n. Totally not a problem! Thanks again for the issue (and details + links)!\n. Thanks for the issue.\n@fredmeews I think this may be a different issue - the UI list only shows containers. Unfortunately there's no current way to create a container from a local image that you've built or imported.\n. Thanks for the feedback and great points, all.\n. @FrenchBen awesome! \n. Hi there! Right now stopped containers are visible (if you run docker stop <container>) they'll grey out. That said there's currently no way to stop them via the interface - added a label.\nThanks for the issue :smiley: \n. @Telemakhos thanks for the note!!\n. Quick update, work in progress here: #433 \n. Hi there! Thanks for creating an issue.\nKitematic syncs with what you do on the CLI as long as commands are run while pointed at the right Docker VM & ENgine. To make sure your shell is correctly either use:\n- $(docker-machine env dev) in a terminal or click the Docker Terminal button in Kitematic:\nOr click on the button shown below:\n\nDoes this work at all?\nIn terms of being able to build an image in Kitematic - that's not yet possible - sorry.\n. This is fantastic - thanks for creating an issue!\n. Thanks for filing an issue about this!\n. In case this helps:\nreproduce: sudo route -nv remove -net 192.168.99\nfix: sudo route -nv add -net 192.168.99 -interface vboxnet0\n. Thanks for creating an issue. This definitely makes sense.\n(Also, it's incredible to see someone from the Perimeter Institute trying out Kitematic :)\n. Thanks for the issue. This is an important one!\n. Fixed in #340. Cutting a release for 0.5.11 later today.\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. This is a duplicate of #235, thanks @ninuxio \n. Thanks for the issue!\nEditing the VM directly in VBox is probably your best bet for now.\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. Thanks for the issue!\nFor now, if you don't use the above button, you'll need to type $(docker-machine env dev) when opening a terminal.\n. @LukeHoersten do you have Kitematic installed? Does ls /usr/local/bin/docker-machine exist?\nMake sure there's a VM and it's running. If so, and you have docker installed, running docker-machine env dev | source should work on all shells\n. @LukeHoersten No worries! Good to hear! :smiley: \n. @omarabid It's not closed :-), though another Closed issue referenced this one 12 days ago\n. @peteruithoven thanks! cc @SvenDowideit in case interesting :smiley: \n. Thanks for the issue. It should be on by default.\nThe website_files directory can be found under ~/Kitematic/<container name>/. Are the files there?\n. Can you post a screenshot of Kitematic with the hello-world-nginx container selected?\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the screenshot! Does creating a 2nd hello-world-nginx container work?\n. Great - does the shared directory work for this second container?\n. Ah! I see. We use VirtualBox shared folders under the hood, which may not work with /Users/ in a separate Volume.\n. Awesome, thanks so much! Also, try to make sure to hit the green button on GitHub when commenting, otherwise the issue keeps being closed :smiley:!\n. Fixed in #340. Cutting a release for 0.5.11 later today.\n. Thanks for the issue! I think that's a great solution\n. Thanks for the issue! Feel free to create a PR! Otherwise we'll get around to this soon!\n. Thanks - can you pull up the logs? You can open the debugger with cmd+alt+I.\n. What's the output of docker-machine ls on a regular Mac OS X Terminal?\nThanks\n. No API key required (sorry about the misleading info msg in the console).\nThis error is caused by our docker-machine bindings.\nLast thing, can you try: ls ./resources?\nAre the docker and docker-machine binaries correctly downloaded in the resources dir? I just pushed a fix for this, so it's most likely the problem.\nTo get the fix, pull latest and run: npm install\nThanks!\n. Good to know!\n. Thanks for the issue! Is this possible on Mac OS X? IIRC the latest versions don't ship with X11.\n. Definitely interested! Can't find your email, but please shoot me a msg: jmorgan@docker.com\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the issue. Is it possible your connection was cut partially through the download? (Stash is a larger image)?\nSide note: stash has a small issue now where it runs as the stash user, which cannot access the host-mounted volume that Kitematic creates.\n. Thanks for the issue! Will investigate\n. Thanks! Good to know @goldibex as this isn't from the web preview for web containers\n. @jpapejr thats right- though it still shouldn't be hogging a bunch of CPU.\n. @olegafx not yet. I assume it's something related to the following:\n- The web preview\n- Background work being done (need to investigate)\n- Chromium in general tends to be a bit of a battery hog\n. Try the ubuntu-upstart image on DockerHub. The regular ubuntu image is mainly used as a base image for other containers. It won't run for long and doesn't have any logs.\nHope this helps and feel free to reopen.\n. Sorry to hear that. Thanks for going through all of that to get Kitematic running.\nAny idea on where it got stuck in setup? Kitematic shouldn't be interfering with an existing Boot2Docker setup as we use docker-machine. Did the app error (and turn red?) What ended up working?\nThanks for the issue!\n. Can you reach https://api.github.com/repos/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases?\nThe biggest cause of this seems to be docker-machine not being able to download the latest version of boot2docker.\nDo you know if you're behind a proxy or any kind of VPN?\nThanks!\n. @imod @kematzy thanks, and sorry for the delay.\nRunning the following on the command line and posting the logs for the 2nd command would help debug this enormously. \n- docker-machine rm -f dev\n- docker-machine -D create -d virtualbox dev\n. From https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=43487, it seems to be a permissions error with VirtualBox. What is the output of the following? (if you don't mind providing it):\n- ls -ld /Applications\n- ls -ld /Applications/VirtualBox.app\n. Closing this for now since it's fixed on master. Feel free to reopen\n. Awesome. Taking a look!\nSorry for the delay in getting back\n. Awesome @allen-servedio ! This is really cool (and asked for a lot). I added some comments\n. LGTM, merging!\n. Thanks for this! Awesome!\n. No worries! I'll merge it in.\nThanks again @allen-servedio !\n. Ok. Merged! Great! Thanks @allen-servedio !\n@DieterReuter this is a neat idea, showing web pages in-app vs opening a separate browser window. We'd need some sort of navigation tree built-in, similar to iOS & Android apps. cc @Elesant \n. This is fantastic. \n1. Strongly agree. Contributors should be displayed openly. There's probably some sort of script we can use here.\n2. This is key and a great idea. We can add this to CONTRIBUTING.md\n3. +1 I think in general that it's hard for a new contributor to start helping with Kitematic right now. Having direct issues linked to our roadmap as a checklist would help people know what can be worked on that's priority.\nSome next steps:\n- [ ] Add an AUTHORS file or similar to show everyone who has contributed code. Find / create a script to regenerate the authors file from Git or the GitHub api.\n- [ ] Change CONTRIBUTING.md to have proposal info\n- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md to have checkboxes linked to priority GitHub issues\n. Thanks @mattsoutherden. I repro'd this - working on a fix.\n. Thanks for the issue. Sorry you had to type the error.\n. Thanks for the issue! This is a duplicate of #236, there's a small workaround there that seems to work for most people. Sorry it got stuck.\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. As a temporary work around, adding a bridge network adapter to the VM could work.\n. Thanks for the issue (and the kind words)!\nOut of curiosity, what do you mean by 'ability to browse all available containers'? On DockerHub?\n. Thanks for the issue.\nTo start from scratch you can run this script we use to reset our environment for testing (warning this erases all VirtualBox, Docker, Kitematic): https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/util/reset\nSorry to see it error'd on setup. Do you know if you're behind a corporate proxy or VPN? This could have stopped Kitematic from downloading the ISO for the Docker VM.\nJeff\n. @connaryscott re-creating the VM should work. Sorry about that - are you able to directly access the VM via docker-machine ssh dev and docker ps once inside?\n@misho-kr Odd - it looks like the iso file docker-machine needs couldn't be downloaded for some reason. If you try again does it work?\n@bwghughes do you know if you have VT-X support enabled on your CPU? It should be by default on Macs. If you run docker-machine start dev what do you get?\n. @misho-kr thanks for the update! Good to know!\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. Thanks for the notes everyone!\n@ericsolberg, love the big :+1: !\n. @amulyas does this work with 0.5.18 (latest release of KM)? It shipped with a new version of machine - might be worth a try.\nThanks!\n. @amulyas thanks, let me know how it goes!\n. @wyattjoh thanks for the feedback. Prioritizing this - logs need to be fast. Sorry about the bad experience.\n. Great! Thanks for the issue!\n. Thanks! Merged.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the issue.\n. @DigitalRogues Thanks, I think we'll need paging for the logs. Looking into this\n. Thanks for creating the issue, and wow, thank you so much for looking into what it would take for Windows.\nIt's mainly for the 'Open Docker Terminal' button in-app (see below):\n\nNote: on startup Kitematic copies docker and docker-machine to /usr/local/bin.\nRight now we could get away with changing this button to run something like: docker-machine ssh dev\n. Great timing @ahmetalpbalkan! Awesome! So cool to see the windows docker binary go out.\n@domderen that sounds great. Thanks for the work so far :)\n. @domderen this is incredible. Thanks for the writeup.\nPlease feel free to create a PR. I've made a windows branch if this helps https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/tree/windows\nAgain, a huge thanks for taking time to do this! Can't wait to jump in once I've fixed a few blocking bugs to help ship this!\n. @ahmetalpbalkan awesome, I'll take this for a spin!\n@domderen just walked through the code on your branch. This looks amazing so far. Please do make a PR! :smiley: \n. Closing since windows is released with docker.exe :smiley: \n. It is. Thanks for the issue!\nWould it be possible to run the following on the command line and show the result? It will run the same command but in Debug mode.\ndocker-machine -D create -d virtualbox dev\nThanks\n. Thanks for the logs - seems like VBox may not have installed properly. Which version of VirtualBox are you running @jonatrey \n. Great to hear. Looks like Virtualbox had a missing device under /dev/ or something. Going to close this for now.\n. Great to hear. Thanks for the info @knice!\nInteresting, it seems that sometimes the VirtualBox kernel extensions aren't properly loaded. Restarting fixes this.\n. Hi there. Thank for the issue!\nWhat would be your ideal behavior of Kitematic for this image? That will help us work together on a fix :smiley: \nNote: Kitematic defaults the to running the command in the CMD directive specified in the image's Dockerfile when it starts the container. In this case there doesn't seem to be a CMD directive. It looks like on the CLI workflow you specify the bash command which keeps the container alive. Kitematic is bad at running these containers in general, since it runs /bin/sh by default.\nSome ideas to fix this:\n- Small fix on this meanjs image: Add CMD mongod to the Dockerfile. This will run the MongoDB process by default.\n- Make Kitematic run some long-running process by default instead of /bin/sh so the container stays alive (by default).\nThoughts?\n. Sorry for the delay\nInteresting, does the DB_1_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR environment variable get set properly in the web container?\n. Also feel free to make a quick sketch up of what you'd imagine this looking like.\n. This pic great for getting your idea across. Thanks. cc @Elesant.\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. Sorry for the delay in getting back. I've been following your work on Windows - this is awesome!\nFeel free to drop by #kitematic on IRC or our gitter channel if you'd like to chat. I'm going to take your branch for a spin soon!\n. Awesome, closing! Thx @domderen !\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. Thanks for the issue!\nThere is no current way to do this at the moment, or at least that I know of. Thanks for coming by the IRC channel.\n. Thanks for the issue and the kind words!\nSince we use docker-machine under the hood, adding support for other providers is definitely possible. You can track progress on that here: #231 \n. Closing this for now since it's a duplicate of #231 \n. Hi, thanks for the issue!\nThis seems to be a duplicate of #231, as docker-machine (what Kitematic uses under the hood for vm management) provides ec2 support\n. Thanks for the issue! Sorry to hear the setup didn't finish. Does retrying happen to work?\nJeff\n. Does restarting the app happen to fix it? If not, try removing the VirtualBox VM and then restarting again if you don't have any containers running yet.\nThanks for the issue!\n. Right now these kinds of errors lock up Kitematic, a good first step is to:\n- Show the cause of the error\n- Allow the error to be ignored / dismissed\n. Sorry for not having a look yet. A little swamped :sweat_smile: \nI like the looks of this on first glance. Great placement of it in preferences - since it's definitely an advanced feature.  Taking it for a spin later today!\n. Looking :smiley: \n. Couldn't quite get this working. What did I miss :)?\n- brew install socat\n- socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\\\"192.168.99.100\\\"\n- Add 192.168.99.100 to the Kitematic X11 preferences\n- Run jess/chrome with Kitematic\nThe container just stops with:\n[1:1:0326/182328:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox! See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment for more information on developing with the sandbox on.\n[1:1:0326/182328:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(216)] Gtk: cannot open display: 192.168.99.100:0\n. What should echo $DISPLAY output? Mine's just blank\n. Silly me, I didn't have XQuartz installed\n. Silly me, I didn't have XQuartz installed\n. Nice! Ok let me try again :smiley: \n. While that sets up, I noticed this feature has many dependencies on Mac:\n- XQuartz\n- socat\n- user needs to start a socat process\nI'm wondering, do you feel that this feature may be a bit hard to make use of on the Mac OS X version of Kitematic (as opposed to possibly a Linux version)?\n. @koddsson Love that idea! Sorry I didn't mention the feedback sooner in the PR. I really appreciate you writing the code for this.\nWe currently support adding environment variables in the container settings pane so I agree it would be best to have docs with the steps:\n- Download XQuartz\n- Download socat\n- Start the socat process\n- Start Kitematic and create the jess/chrome container\n- Change the DISPLAY environment variable for the newly created container\nI think moving to docs makes a lot of sense since the steps are mostly manual. I'd love to include a new article with this Gif and steps in the kitematic docs (https://kitematic.com/docs). We'll be open sourcing the docs in the next week or so.\nWhat do you think?\n. @koddsson Anytime! Sorry again for not getting to this sooner. Thanks so much for creating a PR!\n. Hi there, thanks for the issue. Really sorry that this is occurring. It definitely looks to be something related to VirtualBox, with docker-machine possibly hanging and opening a bunch of files.\nThis issue seems familiar so I'll try to reproduce it on my side as well.\n. Thanks! \n@pomahtuk could you run the following commands to re-create the VM and see what's causing the error?\n- docker-machine rm -f dev\n- docker-machine -D create -d virtualbox dev\nThanks!\n. @pomahtuk thanks!\nExit status 255 errors should be fixed in the next release of Kitematic which will include docker-machine 0.2.0\nThat said, as a temporary solution I've found (will wipe all docker / vms):\n- Remove any VirtualBox VMs\n- Remove the ~/.docker directory\n- docker-machine -D create -d virtualbox dev\n. Thanks for the issue.. sorry you're hitting this error.\nDoes removing the dev VirtualBox VM work? Would it be possible for you to check if it's running?\n. LGTM. Merging\n. Hi there! Thanks for the issue.\nThere isn't a way to deploy containers to servers via Kitematic (yet!, there's an issue tracked here: #231).\nThis seems to be similar to that issue, but with a spin on having a workflow from Laptop => Server so I'll keep this open :smiley: \n. This must be caused by the VirtualBox filesystem. Keep an eye on similar issue #209 \n. Closing this for now since it will be fixed at the same time & is the same issue as #209.\n. Hi there!\nThanks for creating an issue :smiley: . This seems to be a duplicate of #232. Closing for now but feel free to reopen if not. Thanks for the note on the extra flag needed.\n. This seems to be duplicate of #286, closing for now.\nThanks for the issue!\n. Thanks for the issue. This is a duplicate of #250. Closing for now. Thanks for the image, though :+1: \n. Thanks for the issue. Duplicate of #209, so I'll close this for now. Look out for a fix soon!\n. Thanks for the issue! Duplicate of #286. Closing for now\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. Awesome! This is amazing progress towards Windows!  No rush to fix the tests.\nI'll clone this and get it up later today. Following that I'll run some of our test cases for the setup. So far, so good though! Wow!\n. @domderen thanks for fixing the tests. Awesome :). Also, I really appreciate some of the overall code improvements (proper use of npm scripts, etc.). This is fantastic.\n. Great! Wow! \nTaking a look over the weekend. It's crazy to see this coming together so quickly. Thanks @domderen \n. Sean (@Elesant) designs Kitematic. He can whip up an awesome Windows header design for Kitematic\n. @domderen ! This is amazing! I'm testing it out right now!\n. In the meantime, I'm reading through the code and just wanted to say wow. This doesn't just add windows but it also reduces the tech debt and introduces some better practices and code design to the project.\nThanks @domderen !\n. Up and running! This is amazing :smiley: \n\n. Added some minor comments but this looks fantastic. Let's get it merged as a checkpoint!\nOne more thing before merging, would it be possible to bundle these as one commit and sign it?\nIt's to certify that you wrote the changes or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. Usually you don't have to bundle the commits for kitematic/kitematic but since none of them are signed it may be worth it. Sorry to bring this up last minute :)\nThanks @domderen ! Amazing.\n. LGTM\nAwesome start at Windows! Ready to merge. This is incredible @domderen \n. Merging! Wooo :tada: :fireworks: \n. Good idea! Will upload one to GitHub.\n. LGTM\n. Thanks for posting this idea :).\n. Thanks for the issue! There's currently no way to edit the ports. I'll label this as a feature :)\n. Thanks :tada: merging\n. Added:\n- Auto updates\n- Installer & Distribution\nto the list. Most likely easiest for us to do both with  https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows\n. Status update: Merged the initial PR @domderen with a few tweaks to make sure Mac still works.\n. Status update: Windows alpha launched last friday! Everything done on this list except for auto updates.\n@domderen this foundational work was critical to getting an initial version of Windows shipped last week. I wanted to say a huge thanks for the contributions. Many Windows users around the world are running containers for the first time!\nGoing to close this for now in favor of an issue only for windows auto-updates.\n. Thanks for the issue.\nTo help me understand this better, can you point to an IntelliJ tutorial or similar? Are you looking for how to get the Docker Remote API URL that Kitematic uses?\n. Wow! Thanks for the help @Jirapong !\nIntellij doesn't work with an engine URL over TLS?\n. @Jirapong awesome. Thanks for the blog post!\n. Thanks for the issue!\nOn first look this seems a bit out of scope of Kitematic. How do you usually do this via CLI? There may be a way to do it via SSH using docker-machine\n. Ah, I see. I think this is either something that:\n- Users can change via SSH for now with the command docker-machine ssh dev \"sudo sysctl -w fs.file-max=524288 \"\n- We could possibly add this as a setting in Kitematic.\nDid boot2docker have any thoughts on this?\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the issue!\nThis is because the debian image is usually meant to be used as a base image and doesn't have a CMD specified in the Dockerfile. In Kitematic it just runs nothing.\nFlagged this as a bug since Kitematic should provide a better UI/UX response for this case.\n. For now ubuntu-upstart is an ubuntu image that should work with Kitematic: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/ubuntu-upstart/\nThat said, the base images should all still work with Kitematic. Leaving this open for now \n. Great to hear, @wcandillon !\n. For now, would this work? Re-create the container, but make sure not to:\n- Click on the \"edit files\" directory icons in Kitematic (that will host mount the volumes)\n- Choose a directory to host mount\nThe UI/UX around mounting volumes needs some work, thanks for posting the issue.\n. Thanks!\nNot quite windows-ready yet but it's getting there fast thanks to @domderen's work!\n. Maybe  Windows (coming soon)? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n. Awesome!!! Merging :tada: \n. Thanks @ninuxio !\n. Will put it up on master too :) sorry for the delay in getting back!\n. It's okay, I just quick-edited on master via GitHub. Thanks @ninuxio :smile: \n. Could just be a one time thing. Will close this for now. Thanks for the issue :smiley: \n. Awesome. Thanks! Merging!\n. Woo! Thanks for contributing to Kitematic @koddsson :tada: \n. Thanks for the issue!\nInteresting - first time seeing this. Does re-downloading Kitematic work?\n. Thanks for the update :smiley: \nFrom this thread: https://discuss.atom.io/t/dont-work-with-mac-osx-10-9-2/6019/3\nIt seems that atom-shell based apps only work if you unzip them using the Archive Utility. Does unzipping the app this way work?\n. No reason to feel dumb! Seems like a silly bug upstream with Atom. Glad we got it working :smiley:. Sadly, it also occurs with some CLI-based unzip tools. This issue will definitely will help others :smiley: \n. Thanks for the issue. Only directories in /Users/can be host-mounted. The UI should be more forgiving of this, so I've marked this as a bug.\n. I see. Thanks for the extra info to debug this.\nIt seems that host-mounting volumes in Kitematic doesn't work unless the host directory is under /Users. Sorry about that. I'll leave the bug label on this for now.\n. Awesome! Thanks @koddsson :). This is a much asked for feature. Higher test coverage is a work in progress, so look out for that soon.\n. Taking a look\n. Just ran it locally. This looks fantastic. The code looks great too. LGTM\nMerging.\n. Thanks for the info @Phazz , @conantp \n. @jjn2009 thanks! This is hugely helpful - sorry about the issues with AnyConnect\n. Thanks for the feedback! \n. @robbles shoot, sorry this happened. Labeled the issue as a bug and working to fix this.\n. @TeckniX sorry about that. Running docker-machine upgrade dev on the command line should work (make sure the VM is running with docker-machine start dev first.\nWorking on a fix to make Kitematic self-contained.\n. Fixed in Kitematic 0.7. Closing\n. Awesome!! LGTM after that one comment\n. Great! Thanks for updating the old code as well. Merging\n. Thanks for the PR! Added a small comment.\n. Any way to sign that last commit? Sorry about that.\nWorking on an easy way to sign once for all commits or similar.\n. Great! Sorry for the delay.\nLGTM! Merging\n. Thanks for the issue! This is a great idea (especially the drag and drop).\n. @prussiap not currently, sorry. Containers can only be pulled and created via DockerHub for now.\nKeep an eye out for work around this soon!\nGoing to close this since it's a duplicate of #296. Thanks!!!\n. Thanks for the issue!\nFor now, you can ssh into the VM via docker-machine ssh and then change /etc/default/docker in the VM. Hope this helps\n. Thanks for the issue!\n. Going to close this for now since we now detect if VBox exists and automatically skip it\n. If it's okay, @domderen I'll just merge this since it's upstream changes being brought into the windows branch\n. Ignore coveralls for now since this is heavy WIP, and there's a bit of refactoring to do to make this more like a Flux structure before doubling down on tests\n. Wait this isn't being merged into windows, I'll create a new PR\n. I'll just merge this if it's okay @domderen since it's just upstream changes (and a little fix to change UID to be a number instead of a string in SetupUtil)\n. Just the point where these changes work on Mac as well (pretty much worked out of the box).\n. Thanks for looking @domderen :)\n. There's lots of problems with host-mounted volumes on Mac OS X, so we're eyeing out different solutions to this. Not entirely sure if this should be work on the docker daemon or if it should be a Kitematic feature, but thanks for the issue for now!\n. @chiedojohn thanks for the note! Taking a look\n. This is great @nathanleclaire. We need to do something about shared folders eventually, since there's two huge issues at hand:\n1. No support for a lot of the FS primitives databases use like MongoDB, Postgres, etc.\n2. No inotify support for development.\nIf I understand NFS will at least fix 1.\n. Thanks @Elesant. Merging\n. Thanks for creating the issue\n@jontayesp Thanks!\nMoving the discussion over to #232\n. @kematzy great! Thanks for the note!\n. @jb510 really sorry to hear that! It's mostly from the Dockerfile. The summary:\nVolumes: Make sure there's a VOLUME directive in the Dockerfile\nPorts: Make sure there's an EXPOSE directive in the Dockerfile\nEnvironment variables:  Use ENV directives in the Dockerfile\nand we'll post a doc article on the website (kitematic.com/docs) soon\n. @jb510 here https://github.com/kitematic/html although we had to squash the image for faster download.\n@mchiang0610 it may be a good idea to make this an automated build instead for the Dockerfile reference\n. Fixed in 0.5.18\n. @diogomonica Great, thanks for the review. Doing a sanity check then merging.\n. cc @Elesant \n. cc @Elesant \n. @johncokos @dleute @davidthewatson sorry that I'm late on the thread. Thanks for the discussion.

In the meantime restarting Kitematic will fix this.\n. @TeckniX awesome! Thanks for refactoring to flux so quickly :smiley: \nTaking a look, and sorry for the delay.\n. This is fantastic @TeckniX ! Sorry it took so long to review it.\nSome inline comments for code.\nFor UI, a few notes. But overall great implementation! Feels at home with the other settings panes :smiley: \n\n@mchiang0610 @Elesant Any feedback on the features + UI?\n. Thanks @TeckniX !\n. @TeckniX Since linking is a critical feature, would you be okay only merging links in this PR? We can create a separate PR for the advanced piece. Linking will make combos like WP+Mysql, Drupal + MySQL so much easier for devs!\nAfter a quick look I think #258 may refer to modifying the memory, cpu of the host VirtualBox VM, and not the containers themselves.\n. This bug was introduced in 0.5.24 but fixed in 0.5.25, sorry about that.\n. Looking\n. Wow, Sven, userguide.md is awesome! It's going to answer so many questions we get from users on a regular basis. I left a couple comments.\nFAQ shouldn't change too much, so that one can be moved. Known issues we can keep as a file in this repo.\nAwesome stuff! Once @moxiegirl @fredlf  have a look, let's get this merged!\n. LGTM, merging.\n. LGTM\n. Shipped in 0.7\n. @peteruithoven Good suggestion: we let users opt-in for that currently but perhaps we can find a good way to add it automatically to their shell profile.\n. Fixed in 0.5.26\n. I think this is because we don't show progress for many v2 images - the registry doesn't provide us the total size anymore\n0.5.26 should bring back some progress and fix this somewhat, but we're working on improving this by showing per-layer progress\n. Great! LGTM on my side. Thanks Sven!\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. @Elesant please look\n. @TeckniX thank you!!\nOne small comment, then LGTM\n. @TeckniX awesome! LGTM! Merging.\n. LGTM\n.

Often this error will show if the Docker engine cannot be reached.\n. @holidayworking fixed in master. AFAIK this only occurs in development.\nThanks for the issue!\n. Taking a look. Thanks for the issue!\n. @jwalant are you able to pull these on the command line? I get:\n$ docker pull netflixoss/hello-netflix-oss\nPulling repository netflixoss/hello-netflix-oss\nFATA[0004] Tag latest not found in repository netflixoss/hello-netflix-oss\n. Seems like there's no latest tag on these repos.\nKitematic should fetch the tags before pulling and default to the first one if latest doesn't exist.\nWill also investigate for the Docker CLI + Index\n. Merging with #576 \n. Apologies - working on a fix for this.\nFor now KM recommended repos are disabled but soon they'll be back.\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Thanks for the issue\nCan you check the logs for any issue: cmd+alt+i then click Console\n. 404 usually means the image pull failed so the image cannot be found. The error message definitely needs to improve.\nTaking a look.\n. Also, if you click the Docker CLI button and then try docker run jenkins, does it work? What is the error?\n. Thanks for the issue. Are there any errors in the console? cmd+alt+i then click Console\n. Good to hear!\n. Thanks for the issue,\nIf you click on the Docker CLI button and try this on the command line:\ndocker pull kitematic/hello-world-nginx\ndoes it work?\n. It seems like you're using a local DNS server, maybe try:\ndocker-machine ssh dev\necho \"8.8.8.8\" > /etc/resolv.conf\nWhich will just tell the Docker VM to use the Google DNS\n. This looks AMAZING. Thank you @TeckniX . Great example of a contribution that touches every part of flux.\nTaking a look!\n. RE the js styles => less comment. I just realized the styles are dynamic - so having them in JS makes sense.\n. Some comments added, and LGTM after that. Again - great add @TeckniX .\n@mchiang0610  @Elesant can you LGTM?\n. Ok, :smiley: best to remove any unused code so we don't need to maintain it later\n.

Thanks!\n. @TechJournalist a current workaround, assuming you've got the Toolbox installed:\n- Close Kitematic\n- Delete the current default VM: docker-machine rm -f default\n- Create a new default machine docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-hostonly-cidr \"192.168.99.1/24\"\n- Open Kitematic and it should be using this VM.\nAs for making this doable via the GUI, I think eventually we'll want KM to be configurable to point to any host but this is work in progress. Check out https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/876 for a cool example of a team at the DockerCon 2015 hackathon (see #3, Lightning Kite) https://blog.docker.com/2015/07/highlights-dockercon-2015-hackathon/\n.

Closing in favor of #704\n. Kitematic shows a list of containers, not images. If the image failed to build then no container will be displayed in either docker ps or Kitematic.\nFor images, see the docker images command. Closing this for now\n. @bgentry thanks for the issue. Sorry - I think GitHub auto closed this, re-opening.\nFor mixpanel, Mixpanel's official node library forces http, but this needs to be changed immediately. Note that no sensitive data is included in Kitematic's mixpanel metrics - only anonymous actions like container created but not which image it was from.\nFor the requests to Kitematic.com, this was just fixed in #710. The only requests over http are for the images in the browse section. Inline scripts are disabled and these images are the same for anyone. On an initial look this posed no immediate risk\nI will cut a new release once both are fixed\n. @bgentry ok fixed the mixpanel part in #711 \nClosing for now - but always feel free to reopen this Thanks so much for spotting this.\n.

Thanks Ben! Awesome!\n. - Did you create a Docker Hub account via Kitematic?\n. This seems to be unrelated to KM itself. As @timfallmk mentioned, there's probably a way to access these npm modules\nFeel free to re-open\n. Merging, thanks!\n. Since I was there at the hackathon: I just wanted to say a huge thanks for building and delivering something cool with Kitematic. And congrats on being a finalist in the hackathon.\n. LGTM\n. Some initial comments, but overall this is looking :+1: ! Awesome! :smiley: \n. The 'My Images' seems like a filter, though it's actually another \"View\". Could we add a line before 'My Images'?\nAlso, I'm a little torn on the name. Would it make sense to rename this to 'Local Images'? What do you think?\n\n. I think this may need a rebase / update to master - sorry for not looking sooner :smiley: \n. UI notes:\n- Any way to show 'No Images' here if the list is empty?\n  \n- LOVE how it updates automatically when I do docker pull xxxxx on the command line.\n- The line below the text is shifted to the left\n  \n- Any way we can set the delete button to disabled instead of showing a warning?\n  \n- Pressing the delete button on an image with running containers of that image caused this <none> image to pop up. :ghost: \n\n. Cool, makes sense. That image may not have appeared if I didn't attempt to delete the other, running image.\nThis feature is awesome. I can see why it's in huge demand :smile: \nOne last remark: maybe we should disable the search field when browsing \"My Images\"? This happens. Alternatively, maybe it should filter the images?\n\n. Great idea - this will help a lot. Let me see if we can get travis to run lint as well once this is merged.\nTaking a look :smiley: \n. This should be fixed in 0.8.5. Thanks to @FrenchBen for the awesome fix.\n. Thanks! Merging\n. Thanks for this!\nWorking on a fix now, this must be a bug with how Kitematic connects to the Docker 1.8 Remote API\n. No worries! Fixed in Kitematic 0.8.1 and Toolbox 1.8.0a\n. LGTM\n. As of 0.8.0 it looks for default. Before we auto update all of the 0.7.x users we may try and add auto migration support.\n. Thanks for the issue.\nKitematic is an electron app (powered by chromium embedded framework), and in this case, renders the preview in a webview. Calls to alert will be handled by chromium and show a dialog window (as in the image you showed), like a regular browser.\nIt does execute arbitrary Javascript as a browser window. But this javascript is contained and should absolutely not have access to node libraries such as fs, net, etc. From the Electron docs:\nDifferent from the iframe, the webview runs in a separate process than your app; it doesn't have the same permissions as your web page and all interactions between your app and embedded content will be asynchronous. This keeps your app safe from the embedded content.\n. Going to close this for now, and thanks again for the issue (and screen shot!)\nBy all means please re-open if you feel this should stay open or if there are any other webview-related security issues!\n. Thanks, sorry for the delay in merging.\n. This should be fixed in the latest toolbox version for Windows\n. This is neat! Thanks Ben! One small comment then LGTM.\n. Thanks!\n. LGTM. Thanks!\n. @FrenchBen sorry for the delay. Thanks for the PR! My initial feeling is that we shouldn't introduce a new config file. Most users will probably create their VM before seeing this feature - meaning they need to delete their VM and re-create it for this to work.\n. LGTM\n. Woo! Issue #1000 \nLooking\n. Tested this out locally, works great! Thanks Ben!\n. LGTM!\n. Thanks Ben! This is awesome.\n. Thanks Ben! Two UX notes:\n1. Should the page switcher be glued to the bottom?\n2. The page selector seems to disappear temporarily when I click on a page and it starts loading. Is there an easy way to make it stay visible?\n. @Elesant ping! Can you take this for a spin?\n. I wouldn't mind merging this interim once the page viewer doesn't disappear.\n. Small UI bug: page icons stay highlighted after clicking on them. For example, click on [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] stays highlighted.\n\n. Also: is there a possible way to make the page selector update as soon as it's clicked?\n. @FrenchBen looking - sorry for the delay\n. Seems to work well now! A couple last things:\n- Maybe, in the RepositoryStore, add a handler for the search action. Could this update the highlighted page number immediately?\n- The << and >> buttons seem to go to the first and last page. Just to check: is this intended?

LGTM after changing to 0.12.0\n. Can we remove the hover-over styling for now?\n. Since it's redundant, should we change the Tooltip text to View on DockerHub?\n. Add semicolons\n. Since jest just tests the javascript module we don't need a windows environment just yet (everything is mocked).\nWon't hurt to have this file though. Awesome!!\n. Wondering if we could use: https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/api/shell.md\n. containerId (camel case :)\nOn that note, I'm working on a style guide for Kitematic javascript - will try putting it up on GitHub this week\n. Since we have es6 support, you can use fat arrow to avoid needing .bind(this)\n- Remove .bind(this)\n- Change:\nfunction (result) {\n}\nto\n(result) => {\n}\n. This regexp isn't correct, fixing\n. rename to stopDisabled\n. @diogomonica here's the updated method with annotations, I pulled it out of the main app.js so I could unit test it. How does it look?\n. Entry point for URL generation.\n. Rename to stopDisabled?\n. Rename to startDisabled?\n. No need to mute here, or in Stop. I didn't catch this in the last one\n. PID-0 might be a little advanced for some users - do we refer to this as anything else? The main process in the container? \n. Ports included are ['80', '8000', '8080', '3000', '5000', '2368', '9200', '8983'] but we may add more.\n. Great note!\n. prefer if ()  { on one line. Similar below\n. Unused, empty function\n. Remove comment if line below works\n. space after ,\n. For a future PR:  maybe we can create a common 'list' component for env vars, links, basically any tables.\ncc @Elesant\n. Space before and after ():\nif () {\n. Space after ,. Same below\n. change to 2 space indent\n. Replace typeof hostConfig.CpuShares !== \"undefined\" with hostConfig.CpuShares and similar below.\n. I don't think this actually returns a container, but rather a reference you can use to call inspect, restart, etc.\nE.g.\nlet container = this.client.getContainer(name);\ncontainer.inspect(err, data => {});\nIt seems that this method would return false every time. Is it needed?\n. How close is this code to the inspiration? Should we add the MIT license in?\n. Not sure if we need this comment.\n. nitpick, spacing: data.num_results - 1;\n. What does the + do here?\n. Great use of default arguments. I had no idea this existed in ES6. COOL!\n. Nitpick: no spaces between { } like above\n. Remove comment\n. Wow. Impressive :smiley:\nI think this inspiration link is ok for now, maybe just add (MIT LICENSE) to the comment\n. Comment necessary?\n. Comment necessary?\n. Often error is null, but responseCode may be 500.\nMaybe add an else statement that calls repositoryServerActions.error({error:data.detail});?\n. Rename this file to InfiniteGrid.react.js\n. Would it be better to just do if (!shell) ?\n. Is there any way to merge these vs a big if statement?\n. Remove console log\n. space between +\n. Remove comments before merge\n. Please use ' instead of \"\n. if (data && data[1] && data[1].Deleted) is a little more defensive\n. use ' instead of \"\nAlso, please add a space after , :smiley: \n. Remove comments for now?\n. space after ,, :\n. Use ' instead of \"\n. Missing semicolon\n. No need to return the callback, but calling it is good\n. Maybe put this in a try/catch block and report the error on catch?\n. I don't think we need to hit /namespaces anymore. Instead (like below), just getting the orgs (and append the user's name) is fine.\n. I think we need to append the username to this list around here.\n. Cut this line, I think a previous change removed it. Thanks!\n. Instead of all the changes in requiredSteps, we could just add the following code at the start of the run function:\n```\nif (util.isLinux()) {\n  yield 'localhost';\n}\n``\n. See above comment\n. Instead of switch could we useif` statements?\nif (util.isLinux()) {\n  // linux\n  ...\n} else {\n  // mac or windows\n  ...\n}\n. Can you move this above the else if (this.state.loading) clause? It will make sure loading doesn't appear if they type in the search bar while browsing My Images.\n. No big deal but this seems to be from another change - is master merged into this?\n. Capitalize since it's a constant.\n. Don't need to put object keys in quotes - only if they contain -.\ni.e. you can do {page: 1, page_size: 100}\n. Same as above - no quotes needed.\n. Makes sense\nI think the best workaround is to eventually use subcomponents, but that's for another PR.\n. Remove\n. Remove\n. Can you add electron:linux to the single grunt task? The idea is grunt release will create all releases for Mac, Windows & Linux.\n. How does this work? Isn't the docker daemon running as root? Do I need to run kitematic as root?\n. Can the linux setup be a separate function named setupLinux? Instead of interleaving it like this.\n. See above comment\n. Sorry for the delay. This sounds good to me - one function for native and one via machine.\n. Correct, can we reduce this to one release task?\n. Don't forget to change this too :)\nsetup().then(() => {\n. They are similar in that they both call the /logs api endpoint, but they behave differently - one streams changes and the other hooks into the logs. I tried merging them in various ways, but kept leaning towards two functions.\n. Space before { \n. Add a space ) {\n. spacing: } else {\n. Initialize to null\n. per above, change to while (!version && retries < maxRetries) {\n. Space before {\n. Should be unnecessary given that we use fat arrow functions. I.e. the  => {  syntax.\n. Simply return error here via reject(error). Then check if (error.code && error.code === precreateCheckExitCode) in the SetupUtil code.\n. let create, overlay;\n. Is this docker.isDockerRunning() line necessary?\n. Best to put this in an else if instead of creating another indent.\n. Why the &&?\n. Why store this setting?\nIf the user starts Kitematic and the socket is available, shouldn't it just use that by default, always? If the socket isn't available, then maybe it should just always use VBox?\n. Remove these comments\n. This happens in URLUtil so I think we can remove it here.\n. Similar to below - can most likely remove this\n. Replace https://registry.hub.docker.com with just https://hub.docker.com\n. same as above\n. I think we may be missing the CSS for this component from the older PR\n. Disregard the previous comment, it would be best to:\n- Call ContainerStore.generateName in the NewContainerPull component instead of here.\n. I think it's better to transitionTo('search'), from testing it goes to a white page if I hit cancel.\n. Since Kitematic only supports Docker Hub repos, I think it's best that we limit to Docker Hub repos (for now), using a check like this:\nif (tokens.length > 3) {\n  return false;\n}\nto avoid pulling from other repos. For example\n['run', 'kitematic', 'hello-world-nginx'] // kitematic/hello-world-nginx is ok but\n['run', 'other-registry-host.com', 'namespace', 'reponame'] // other-registry-host.com/namespace/reponame should not be accepted for now\n. I think here we need to transition to view our new container being pulled! Add a line like:\nthis.transitionTo('containerHome', {name});\n. nitpick - can just do if (!error)\n. 0.12.0\n. ",
    "mchiang0610": "Hey, \nKitematic seems to have a conflict with older versions of boot2docker at the moment. We're still looking into this issue. \nIn the meantime, some of our users have found success in doing this: \n1. In the terminal run boot2docker delete\n2. Open Virtualbox and delete the boot2docker vm\n3. Delete all the host-only networks under VirtualBox=>Preferences=>Network=>Host-only networks tab\n4. Run the installer again\n. Hey guys, \nWe updated the installer with patches. This issue should be solved. \nLet me know if there are still problems. :) \n. what do you guys think about .kite / .kitedev ? \n. We tried live filesystem mount, but it didn't work with databases such as mongodb that require filesystem API - fsync. This is why we moved away from that, and are using unison. \nhttp://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/production-notes/#kernel-and-file-systems \n\"MongoDB requires a filesystem that supports fsync() on directories. For example, HGFS and Virtual Box\u2019s shared folders do not support this operation.\" \n. @lburton It's not portable if you can't move the volumes. If you can move the volumes, it will be portable, and not just for dev. purposes. \n@detailyang Sorry about the performance. The sync should actually be instant. It's really buggy right now. \n.

Thanks for submitting the bugs guys! We are still looking into proper fixes for this. \n. Hmm.. Sorry about this. \nCan you try: \n1. Remove the kitematic VM inside virtualbox. \n2. rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Kitematic     (This will remove the kitematic app data stored.) \n3. Run the installer again \nHopefully this will solve the problem.  :) \n. Can you try terminating all the virtualbox processes as well? (There should be 4? I think) \n. +1 through another error report.  \nThanks for submitting. \n. Hi Peter,\nFor version 0.3, we made compatibility with Docker CLI, and whatever was done through it will show up in Kitematic as well.\nOn Thu, Oct 23, 2014 at 8:38 AM, Peter Jaros notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI've deleted ~/Library/Application Support/Kitematic and ~/Kitematic and the VM from VirtualBox and reopened Kitematic to let it rebuild. Now it appears to be working.\nThe only thing left is that I'm still seeing the ubuntu images in the image list. Perhaps that's now the intended behavior?\n\nI'm still seeing the images shift around. Specifically, the ubuntu images periodically change the order they appear in. I don't have to do anything to make that happen, it just moves.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/108#issuecomment-60258695\n. Fixed in v0.6 - please re-open if you are still running into issues. \n. @Fenkiou By boot2docker VM, are you referring to Kitematic using boot2docker to provision the VMs? Kitematic uses Docker-machine (latest from Docker) to provision the VMs. \n\n@MoonStrike On Windows, Kitematic now provisions \"kitematic\" VM instead of \"dev\" VM. The reason why this is not happening for Mac yet is because we have users currently on the \"dev\" VM on Mac, and we will need to transition them. \n. We are working on this openly with contributors. Please feel free to voice your opinion as this is still in early draft: \nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Machine-Management \n. Hi Zack, \nWe are working on fixes. An update to fix the issues should be available by the end of the week. \nThe update will be v0.4.\n. Thanks for submitting.

I would like the logs. \n. @mhoudg Did you try the v0.5.27-intel-nic one?  The v0.5.27 official release doesn't have the fix. The pre-release: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.5.27-intel-nic \n. @mhoudg The official release version doesn't have the patch yet because we are still testing the patch. This one should fix it. https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.5.27-intel-nic \n. @lordillusions Thanks. There are still a lot of work in stabilizing Kitematic. We are dependent on many projects so we are trying our best to make sure the issues get solved in a 'somewhat' timely fashion. :) \n. Merging with #1029 \n. @yarmenti \nCan you check your virtualbox, and remove the \"default\" VM by choosing (delete all files), and then run the installer again? \nIf you are connected in a VPN environment or proxy, it will not work at the moment. \nPlease comment on #1029 to help us have the issues merged. \n. @MatthiasLohr Are you seeing this error if just installing Docker machine from command line? \n. @MatthiasLohr It seems like the proxy is not giving you access to GitHub (where Kitematic may pull data). \n. @MatthiasLohr Thanks for the update.

Closing this one to consolidate duplicate issues. \nSee https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/469 \n. @diegodfsd I agree Kitematic needs to show errors better. In this case, Kitematic lost contact with the VM. (Kitematic did not get a response back) \n. @gunjan5 Hi Gunjan, Kitematic can't run base images. Are you looking to run Ubuntu?

Remove the container and restart Kitematic \n2. Create it again \nThis usually happens when Kitematic can't contact the VM. \nLet me know if you are still having trouble. \n. duplicate of #482. Please comment there; https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/482 \n. @LengBinBin Can you provide more details regarding this? What image did you use? \n. @LengBinBin, both of these would error in Kitematic. \nCentOS is a base image, and is not handled by Kitematic. (Sorry about this, we should have done a better job informing our users). \nPython official image is not running due to the python script. https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/python/ \nFor both of them, if you use the whale button within Kitematic to run, they will work. (And then you can configure it)\n. Closing this as this issue applies to a broader scope - buttons need to feel like buttons. \nSee: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/508 \n. +1 to editable port mappings from @johncokos\n. Currently, we are focusing Kitematic on making the process of pulling / creating / running containers really easy, hence some abstraction where the \"create\" button in kitematic pulls the docker image, creates a docker container, and then runs it. \nThis is a valid comment, just not ready. Please re-open if there is a need. \n. @SvenDowideit This is completely valid. We created a docs label for this! \n. In release notes now. \n. @casalot Thanks for this bug report. This is a known issue for Kitematic\n. @SvenDowideit We have the start button that unpauses the container. \n. @SvenDowideit Anyway we can make the current design have a delete button that's easier to find? \n. @SvenDowideit  @jeffdm  Adding to this: \nTo prevent a repeat of the stuck at 99% error, we should have a hard timeout if KM receives no response within a certain timeframe. ( 1 min might be a good start) \n. Fixed in v0.6 \n. Fixed in v0.6 \n. Adding @Elesant in for discussion.\n. Merging discussions in here for button feedback. \n. @nathanleclaire Thanks for that note. \nThe reason for not using custom cursors is due to us trying to have a more native experience. (Ie. when you hover over Mac OS icons, your cursor will not change.) \nThis suggestion is more for providing feedback to the users when the button is depressed (ie. changing colors or feel of the button being depressed). \nSuper good suggestions though. \ncc: @Elesant \nIn v0.6 we are enhancing this - already complete. \n. @TeckniX That would suffice as the first step. \nI think what @johncokos want is to know when the container is up and running && the software inside has started as well. \n. @johncokos, Kitematic provides live logs. \nWe are going to go with the assumption that if the container is up and running, that's what Kitematic will report. \nIf the program written provides logs, Kitematic will live stream it. \nFeel free to re-open the issue if anyone feels there is something that can be done better here. \n. @johncokos I see what you mean now. \n. @johncokos this should be improved in the upcoming version of Kitematic (v0.6) \n. @basavaraj1985 It's most likely due to Kitematic unable to connect to the VM. \nCan you open VirtualBox and remove the VM called \"dev\". (Do note, if you have previously been working on Docker machine, it will remove the data). \nOnce that is done, restart Kitematic. \nGoing to close this for now. Please re-open if it doesn't work. \n. @wakensky Thanks for submitting an issue. We currently have a progress bar (in spinner form). Are you having any trouble with it?\nAre you looking for % sign? More traditional progress bar? \n. @vangdfang Thanks for submitting the workaround as well. \n. If anyone still has problems with this on Mac or Windows 10+, please contact me at mchiang@docker.com.\nWe are working on something to help address this issue.\n. @pucchur We are targeting the end of June. \nThat being said, we are planning to have public tests early June, would you like to take part in that? \nIf so, would I be able to know what you are planning to do with Kitematic? (specific use cases?) \nThanks! \nmchiang@docker.com \nPS. Closing this issue for now. Feel free to answer me via comments or email me. :) \n. @pucchur Not yet. There is a windows branch that is being actively worked on, but it may be broken at times as it's in heavy development. Thanks! \n. @kostonstyle Sorry about that.  Do you mind going into virtualbox and removing the \"dev\" VM, and also restart Kitematic to automatically create it again? \n. @kostonstyle Do you have a script in your bash shell? \n. Another user had this issue: \nTry: docker-machine regenerate-certs dev\n. Should be fixed with latest toolbox \n. @epavlenko It seems to be running well. Does KM get stuck at 2%? (The logs you are showing seem all good) \n. @epavlenko One of the older version of KM may have a bug that caused that. Are you running the latest Kitematic? (Mind also checking if you are running the latest virtualbox? ) \nThanks, and sorry about the experience so far. \n. @epavlenko Ah. Good. Do you mind trying this version of Kitematic? It should fix that issue. Let me know if it doesn't. \nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.5.27-intel-nic\n(Note: this is a pre-release build that we are using to test the getting stuck at 99% bug)  Reference this issue: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/236\n. Closing this issue in favor of that issue now. (since it's the same) https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/236\n. @javajosh Thanks for sending this in. \nWhat specific docs do you think would be a good start?\n. @TeckniX Sorry for the delay. This seems to be a sporadic problem. I cannot reproduce most of the time. Opened an issue so we are aware. \n@ianbytchek Yes, same error. \n. Should be fixed with latest Docker Toolbox\nJust in case, merging with #1029 \n. @cpuguy83 Thanks for this! I cannot produce this on my Macbook (Yosemite 10.10.3). \nIs there a specific environment where I can reproduce this? \n. @johncokos, the backlash from doing so is stopping the support of volumes. \nThe reason for this is most likely due to nodemon doing polling on the shared folder - causing high CPU. (This is a problem within Docker that we will have to solve) \n. @johncokos you'll lose the ability to mount anything, unfortunately. :( \n. Thanks! Checking it out. \n. @mansolo Hi, redis and mariadb should work (mariadb will require some configuration). \nUbuntu and CentOS should not work as they are base images and are not supported in Kitematic. \nIf you are looking to run Ubuntu, please try the Ubuntu-upstart one. \nThanks! \n. @bradbergeron-us Thanks for sending this in. This is the first time we've seen this. \nI wasn't able to reproduce this on my end.

Hi @jammer76 Kitematic / Docker-machine currently do not play well with proxies at the moment.

Type in docker-machine ssh \n3. echo \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" > /etc/resolv.conf\n. @tomdavidson in your log, I didn't see the \ndocker-machine ssh command. Without it, it wouldn't work. \n. @tomdavidson Can remove the \"dev\" VM inside virtualbox, and restart Kitematic (v0.6.5)? \nThere had been a problem with Docker Hub, and it should be fixed now. \n. @tomdavidson That is correct, but instead of boot2docker, we use Docker's latest Docker-machine. \n. @gcobr Can you restart Kitematic? It should hopefully fix this issue. \nIt works on my end, and cannot reproduce. \nIf you are still running into problems, please let me know, and re-open the issue. \nThanks! \n. @gcobr Are you connecting through proxy or VPN?

Thanks @adlermedrado, it's a problem we have connecting to Docker Machine\n. @dstroot Yes, you should ignore this. \nThis is just automated to get Docker-machine running. \n. @cousine Thanks for this. We are noticing many 404 errors, and are looking into this. (Will be merging all the issues to a central one). \n. Closing this in favor of: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/588 \n. Comment from @cordobo in previous thread in case anyone would like this:\nUPDATE:\nChanging the GUESTS network from \"NAT\" to \"Bridge\" in Virtual Box worked as fine, although Kitematic wasn't able to startup (hanging at 99%). Switching back to \"NAT\" made Kitematic available again.\nORIGINAL COMMENT:\nThis solved the problem of having too many redirects (see console output) or getting a \"404 image not found\" and worked for me on OSX 10.10 with VirtualBox 4.3.28:\nOpen \"Virtual Box > Settings > Network > Host-only-networks\"\nSelect \"vboxnet0\" and klick on the screw driver (ohhh, the irony...)\nSelect DHCP-Server and uncheck the checkbox from \"Activate Server\".\nAccept with \"OK\".\nRestart Kitematic.\nHTH\nCordobo\n. @gcobr @d3ming @iSashaCH \nThere was a DNS switch on Docker's side. It should be fixed. If not, please flush DNS. \nsudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache;sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches;say flushed \nPlease comment here if you are having problems. Otherwise, I will close this issue tomorrow. \nThanks! \n. @simondean Glad it's working for you now. :)\nIf you'd like Kitematic to stop the VM upon closing -> please go into Kitematic settings and check that box. The reason we don't stop the VM is because if we shut it down, you'd have to start it up again if you need to use Docker via command line. \n. @kevinSuttle \nIf you search it should appear within Kitematic: \n\nClosing this for now.

I will close this issue for now. If you run into it again, please feel free to reopen it, and we can troubleshoot from there. \nThanks! \n. Just ran it. Super cool. \nA couple comments in the screenshot: \n\n. @TeckniX the loading spinner should be at the bottom. \n@jeffdm there are performance issues in Kitematic when many repos are listed. (Kitematic issue) \n. @jeffdm anything specific to run it with? \n. @VojtechBartos Thanks for the PR! This is an awesome feature, and an amazing start. \nWe'd need some error checking for the port numbers before we can merge. \nFor example: \n1. Port numbers must be in range \n2. Cannot accept characters other than numbers \n3. Prompt user if there is a port conflict \n. @VojtechBartos  Can we not allow - ports 22 and 2376 ?  These are the ports that Kitematic / Docker uses.  \nLGTM otherwise. :) \n. @VojtechBartos Thanks! Just one more bug that I noticed: \nThe port is correctly mapped when I checked via command line but it's not showing up in Kitematic. \n\n. @VojtechBartos It works. Do you think we should block common ports from being used? For example if you try the hello-world-nginx image from Kitematic, and change to port 123 (NTP), it would just not run. \n(ie. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959828.aspx) \n. @TeckniX Thanks. Tried it manually. \nTested working: \n1. Works with existing containers with volumes \n2. New containers are in the new Documents/Kitematic/container_name folder  \nLGTM for the feature. \n@jeffdm Look good on your end? \n. merging this with: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n. Thanks! It does run now once you have Node 0.10 installed, and then running npm install, npm start. \nThat being said, there is still some work for Kitematic to work on Linux. \n\n. @ronnieserr Hi Ronnie, sorry about this problem. \nThe reason why the repos are not running is because those containers require specific commands to be inputted in order to run. \n(See: https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/node/  ) \nYou can run these containers by using command line through the Docker CLI button. \n. This is definitely a problem we need to solve on the Kitematic end though. (Perhaps by inserting a default run command to keep the containers running at least). \n@jeffdm @Elesant @nathanleclaire thoughts? \n. @TeckniX Yeah, that might work, but I don't think all CMDs will work correctly. \nFor example, docker run node   (which pulls the official node image that has the CMD directive -  CMD [ \"node\" ] will not work. \n. This is fixed with @TeckniX's latest pull request that has been merged. @ronnieserr can you try this again? \nThanks! \n. @ronnieserr Hi Ronnie, \nIf you have a dockerfile locally, please click on the Docker CLI button in the bottom left corner of Kitematic, and then do the docker build and docker run commands. \nThe result should show in Kitematic after. Thanks! \n. There is a feature request for this feature: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/574 \nClosing this thread to merge the conversation over to the other. \n. @TeckniX When I click create on an image, the view no longer changes to the container. Is this part of this PR or a side effect? \nWhat are the states for the notifications? (What errors / logs will trigger the notifications?) \n. @markebrown Hmm, this one in particular seem to have the latest tag. \nI was able to get the error as well - however it was a problem on the Docker Hub side, and it should be fixed now. \nCan you try again? Thanks! \n\n. merging this with: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n. Hi @ovizii thanks for bringing this up. \nIn order to change the paths that you mount, you will have to change it on the Docker image. \nTry the Nginx one that Kitematic recommends \n\n. Thanks @TeckniX. Trying it out \n. @jeffdm LGTM. Can you review the code? \nThanks! \n. @chromerobv This is a known issue in Kitematic release log. We currently only support private repos under your account. \nOrganization feature will be coming soon. \nThanks! \n. @SpokeyWheeler @benwu7 Unfortunately 404 error message in Kitematic can mean all sorts of different errors. We are working on a new update that will output better errors to help troubleshoot with this. \n. Merging with #1030 \n. merging this with: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n.

I'll add it as a feature request for people to vote on. \n@TeckniX's suggestion is sound if you're inclined to do so. \n. @TechJournalist Sorry, I meant this as a place where people can comment and help submit a PR. \n. Hi @TechJournalist , to do a pull request on Kitematic please feel free to fork Kitematic's code, make the necessary changes on your repository, and then make a pull request to us. That is when we will review the code with the team. \nI believe this might be a feature for Docker machine - adding @nathanleclaire from Machine team for technical help. Also cc'd @jeffdm \nThanks for helping! \n. @johnmarty Can you restart Kitematic again and give this a try? \nIf you are still running into issues, can you please give us the error log or a screenshot? \nThanks\n. Merging with: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n. merging with: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n. @mannickutd Are you connected through VPN?   \nMind opening up virtualbox and removing the dev VM in it. Please restart Kitematic again after. \nThanks\n. @mannickutd Thanks Nick. This is likely a conflict between boot2docker and docker-machine. \ncc/ @nathanleclaire to see if he wants any specific logs to help us continue to troubleshoot this. \n. @nathanleclaire Judging by this created 2 days ago. Yes, it would be with Machine RC3. \n@mannickutd Can you confirm which version of Kitematic you are running? \n. @bargulg 404 means Kitematic had trouble pulling. (We shouldn't display a 404 error in the future. We put most errors into 404 state but doesn't print out the actual error. This will be corrected in the future builds. \n. merging this with issue https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n. @mainiak Thanks for the feature request. \nKitematic currently allows you to use your Docker Hub account and start containers from your own images. \n. merging this with issue https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/626\n. @alihalabyah It's working for me. Are you connected through VPN / proxy? \nWhich specific image did you try?  (I tested it on the official ubuntu-upstart image) \n. @TeckniX This is HUGE. Tried running it, and it works very well. \nI think the attach standard streams to a tty, including stdin if it's not closed should be on by default. \nCan we change the \"Foreground Options\" text to \"Advanced Options\"? The reason is so users learning Docker / Kitematic will not try to break things if they don't know. \n. @jeffdm \nLGTM on Mac for features - briefly tried search, pulling, login, logout, signup, docker cli button, settings, feedback. \nBeen testing this branch on Win 7; W8.1, so those work feature wise. \n@Elesant to review code. \n. @ystrem @alonewolfx2 Thanks for submitting the issue. We are working on fixing this before we email out the alpha. \n. Try this: \n- Open virtualbox \n- Go to File -> Preferences -> Network \n- Go into host-only networks and remove all the ones with a # on it. \n- Delete the Kitematic VM \n- launch Kitematic again \n. Merging with #1030 \n. Thanks for reporting this. May I ask for the exact error message you have? \nDid you get a 404 no latest tag found? Is this on Mac or Windows? \n. @nicklaslof Is that from the 12\" Macbook as well? \n. @mfkilgore You can manually use docker commands through Kitematic by pressing the Docker CLI button on the bottom left of the Kitematic interface for now. \n. @mohdaliiqbal Sorry about this. Was this on Mac or Windows? \nDid your images finish downloading after deleting the VM and running it again? \n. @mohdaliiqbal Thanks. Do you know which version of Kitematic this happened on? There was an earlier version that had a bug, and we fixed it in 0.7.2 \n. @ojacques Thanks for reporting. I believe the proxy issue is a known issue with Docker machine. \ncc @nathanleclaire @ehazlett\n. If anyone still has problems with this on Mac or Windows 10+, please contact me at mchiang@docker.com.\nWe are working on something to help address this issue.\n. LGTM. Thanks! \n. @david-guenault You can go into settings and go into the ports panel to change ports. Thanks! \nAlso if you prefer command line, you can use -p option through the Docker CLI button by using Docker command line. \n.

It won't be part of the 0.8 release that's going out next week but we are working on it for the longer term. \n. @edwardIshaq It could also be because a network connection timed out. \n. @VelizarVESSELINOV Thanks for this request. We are looking into how to deal with this in the new Kitematic design. It won't be ready as part of the Docker 1.8 (kitematic 0.8) release that's going out next week, but you can bet that we are working on this for our everyday Kitematic users. \n. @wnthompson78 Hi Nick, thanks for reporting this. \nThis is a feature that we will need. \n. Hi @estheryou Can you give me more information on this? \nYou should be able to search within Kitematic, and get to it. \nClosing this issue for now.

Please go into Kitematic: \n\nHopefully this helps! \nIf you have more questions regarding Docker Hub, please do not hesitate to contact support@docker.com, where we can help you more! \nThanks,\nMichael Chiang\n. @estheryou does Kitematic show it as running? That server may require you to set the username and password for the specific server.  In this case you can find the settings within Kitematic's environment variable settings. \nUnfortunately, I cannot help further as it's a problem with the way that particular repo is set up. Please try contacting the creators of that project. \nThanks! \nMichael \n. @estheryou Can you go into virtualbox and fully delete the VM, and then try again? \nThanks\n. @phuongtailtranminh Does using \"delete VM and retry setup\" help? Or do you get back to this page? \nCan you also open virtualbox, and screenshot its state? \nThanks! \nMichael\n. @phuongtailtranminh sorry. Just noticed that you are on Windows 10. \nUnfortunately VirtualBox does not currently support Windows 10. They are currently working on a fix. \nThanks,\nMichael \n. This means boot2docker / docker machine / kitematic that use Virtualbox will not currently work with Windows 10. \n. @phuongtailtranminh I will post here when VirtualBox has a bug fix regarding Windows 10 support. \nThanks\n. closing due to no reply.

Closing due to inappropriate use of language. \n. Hi, Kitematic can support uppercase characters. I just tried again. \nAre you able to log into Docker Hub fine? \n. @alantech21 is this on Mac or Windows? \n. Just to make sure. \nToolbox is installed correctly, and both Kitematic and the quickstart app works?  (They both use Docker Machine underneath - if that fails nothing will work) \n. Sorry, I don't quite understand. To get to the login menu in Kitematic, it would mean that Kitematic was set up correctly. \nAre you unable to see the login screen anymore? \n. Can you open Virtualbox: \n1. Remove the default VM (make sure to select delete all files - otherwise, it will fail) \n2. remove the .docker folder by running rm -rf .docker \n3. Rerun the Toolbox installer \n. @alantech21 No, Kitematic just uses Docker machine like the command line tool. \n. Glad it's resolved. Thanks! \n. @vraman0601 This is odd.

    "hagmonk": "+1 that fixed it for me\n. @mk101 when you say \"didn't work\" do you mean there were filesystem errors? It's kind of funny for MongoDB to require this, since fsync() will cause the kernel to flush its file information to disk, but it's not deterministic at all. The buffers on the hard drive for performance reasons can delay actually writing the data to disk for quite some time. At best it's wishful thinking on the program's behalf, they shouldn't place any solid bets on it.\nThe sync with Unison will never be \"instant\" when it comes to moving data into the container. From the container's perspective, it's going to look like files are being streamed onto disk by another process. Unison may shove files into place afterwards, in which case the container's process looking for a particular file will see nothing until it magically appears in whole. That doesn't help containers whose first CMD relies on files being present.\nThe advantage of a filesystem mount is in fact that the \"sync\" is instant. When a process inside the container asks for a directory listing, and the directory is backed by a remote filesystem mount made from inside the boot2docker VM, the system call in the VM will block while that data is retrieved. The container will only ever see the true on disk reality, rather than in-progress copy states. This is, on the whole, a lot more desirable.\nEverything has tradeoffs, however. You found one, which is that the virtualbox filesystem doesn't support fsync() on directories. You have to decide whether that is a good tradeoff for your user base, which I acknowledge is hard before you actually have a user base :) Another significant tradeoff is filesystem space. For unison you are duplicating all the content inside the container, which eats disk space. Another tradeoff is the setup expense. Unison is easy to set up, while smb or nfs will rely on the vagaries of the host VM OS and require setup on the OS X side too.\nI think there are two use cases here to consider.\n- content that has to be present inside the container for correct operation. For this, you can't rely on rsync or unison after the container starts, because you can't assume everyone's code is resilient to starting with a partial filesystem state.\n  - option 1: start the container in two stages. Invoke /bin/sh as the command, wait for the unison sync to finish, then restart the container with its real command. I haven't tried this but it seems plausible and portable (/bin/sh should always exist). Effectively you're doing the blocking operation on everyone's behalf.\n  - option 2: use a remote filesystem mount like nfs or smb.\n  - option 3: specify it as an ADD in the Dockerfile, which implies it's a one-way operation.\n- content that has to be present inside the container, but won't break container startup\n  - unison is fine for that :)\n.

Ok it looks like I found the answer to this. Kitematic does use boot2docker. It looks like the ports for the host are already forwarded all the way from boot2docker to the container.

Thanks @Regner closing. @kballard Feel free to implement such feature and send us a PR :)\n. @zedtux @nakedhitman I think that's the right approach - Adding support for every flavor of terminal would be a nightmare. \nThe symlink should be a good enough fix and could be added to the wiki within a Linux section - We'd probably need some sort of try/catch and provide a link to the wiki to the user.\n. @zedtux Here's the wiki entry - Let me know if anything is missing or should be changed:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes\n. @who-me Can you confirm your nodeJS and npm version?\n. @zedtux This is where I've added the stuff - Feel free to edit anything in the Linux version:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes\n. @dalareo @pauloch8 As you can see opinions differ on when this works properly - The kitematic already has to QA OSX/Windows, I believe it's only normal that additional QA is made for this pull prior to seeing it being merged.\n@pauloch8 As mentioned in the comments above, there's an entire wiki section for this (moved now to it's own wiki page):\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Early-Linux-Support\n. @sanderboom maybe I should've looked at what's in the repo.... I thought you created a true binary, maybe it's just a compiled js?\n. @scs3jb native package/apt-get/yum is on the list of things that still need to be implemented. Buttoning up a few things in the PR to then see it merged\n. @fnkr more than a binary, there's been discussion of a package creation, but nothing has been set - Feel free to contribute and implement a package step :D\n. @zedtux all the binaries are built using the Gruntfil - I didn't see an entry to get that done in your Linux PR - Feel free to add one :D\n. @adomenech73 exactly -- it would be nice to have the npm run release be the trigger for:\n- Mac\n- Windows\n- Linux (deb package or executable)\nThe packaging and support for different Linux versions may be an extra step that would be opiniated\n. @mercuriete not sure what you mean?\n. I see; It would be useful to have for local dev, but not very practical in our current build process.\n. @geovanisouza92 There is no packaging issue - If you look at the latest release we now have a full-blown Ubuntu package available for download. \n. @geovanisouza92 @carukc https://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n@zedtux it was created for debian but Ubuntu being a bigger keyword, it's named Ubuntu. \n. Thanks @adomenech73 for sharing the results of cross-platform builds. \n. @b-long I believe we only get the last x lines of logs instead of everything. \n. @wrathagom The logic is still very similar, where Kitematic needs to have the ability to connect to 'another' machine than the 'default' it currently uses. \nAll machines, local or remote, should be listed in docker-machine thus allowing Kitematic to work with them. \n. So I have this PR that's gone stale: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/898\nShould I bring it back up to date since we've now got docker-compose inside the docker toolbox?\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I believe most of these to be fixed in the latest Docker for Mac/Windows+Kitematic.\n. @eturino I understand the issue at hand, but you should be able to create a data container and simply map mariadb to it - You can copy your data to the container and back it up pretty easily as well. \nIf you need a new mariadb container, just scale it and allow it to grab the volume from the above data container.\n. @blazeeboy You can setup a data volume and have Postgres write to it. The same volume can be used on a production machine as well.\n. @blazeeboy Something like this would work:\n```\nCreate a volume for all of the Postgres Data\ndocker run -d --name pgsql-volume -v /var/lib/postgresql/data tianon/true\nCreate your postgres container using the volume created above\ndocker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword --volumes-from pgsql-volume -d postgres\n```\nIf you need to backup/restore/migrate your data, follow the following:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes\ncontainer logs:\n```\n...\nThe database cluster will be initialized with locale \"en_US.utf8\".\nThe default database encoding has accordingly been set to \"UTF8\".\nThe default text search configuration will be set to \"english\".\nData page checksums are disabled.\nfixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/postgresql/data ... ok\ncreating subdirectories ... ok\nselecting default max_connections ... 100\nselecting default shared_buffers ... 128MB\nselecting dynamic shared memory implementation ... posix\ncreating configuration files ... ok\ncreating template1 database in /var/lib/postgresql/data/base/1 ... ok\ninitializing pg_authid ... ok\ninitializing dependencies ... ok\n...\n```\nIf you remove the postgres container and create a new one, the container logs will be (notice no DB creation) \ud83c\udf89 :\nLOG:  database system was shut down at 2016-04-13 00:50:46 UTC\nLOG:  MultiXact member wraparound protections are now enabled\nLOG:  database system is ready to accept connections\nLOG:  autovacuum launcher started\n. Probably should be merged with: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/232\n. @KostyaSha Yup and why I commented on here- #232 should be merged here is what I meant to say :+1: \n. @dannc not sure if I follow.\n210 - Ability to add private registry (OP comment: I would like to pull container images from private hubs )\n232 - Allow pulling images from private repositories\nHow are these not related?\n. @dannc I believe the latest Kitematic currently works the private user/org repos. Should this issue be closed then?\n. @stefanhong do you have a private hub I can look at?\n. @dannc @stefanhong There is a misunderstanding here.\nHub is a CMS - Content Management System that provides auth, search, etc.\nRegistry is a CDS - Content Distribution System that allows you to push/pull your images (like a CDN)\nUnless you know what your resource is, very much like a CDN, you can't get that resource. \nFor example for you to get an image from CDN you need to know the exact image name, otherwise you get nothing. \nRegistry is the same thing, you need to know the exact name of the image before you can pull it.\n. @dannc The PR you mentioned was closed as it was created without much knowledge of the CMS/CDS mentioned above. I had the exact same idea as you did regarding pointing Kitematic to the https://localhost/v2 url when the PR was created. The issues mentioned in the comparison of CMS/CDS is what makes it very difficult and makes the PR unusable. \n@jbw91 @dannc maybe what would help is the current usage of your local registry? How do you 'view' images stored? Do you just 'know' what to pull?\nRegistry being a simple CDS, has no Auth, no Search, no list of User images. This is the 'magic' that a CMS (Hub) adds. \n. @jbw91 Now you're talking about a different product - Docker Trusted Registry vs Private Registry (discussed in this thread)\n@dannc that's exactly it, glad the discussion made more sense. :)\nThe tags list would only show the tags for a specific image, you'd have to specify the exact image name first or get an image not found if you made a typo!\n. @stefanhong How do you envision Kitematic knowing about this list of available images, so they could be displayed on the Create/New page?\n. @lhorne That's correct it lists the images, but you cannot search them. As an application we cannot add half-working features, as it would break the current flow.\nAdditionally you would also be missing the authentication part of it. \n. Please use the \ud83d\udc4d feature of Github - Having these +1 added all over the place does not help - Locking the conversation until a proper proposal has been drafted.\n. @clatko Would you accept, at the enterprise level, a half-bake product where things work only 1/2 way?\nAs mentioned a few comments above (https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/210#issuecomment-156210361 & https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/210#issuecomment-156252142) the issue is not with the registry but handling all of the components that go with it, such as authentication.\nSee: \nhttps://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/\nps: The best way to see it implemented is to do it yourself. Please open a PR with what you believe is the bare minimum. I'll be happy to review it and merge it if appropriate. \n. Any help is appreciated @clatko - thanks for taking a shot at it :)\n. @alankent the user/pass auth you specify are tied to a certain internal auth endpoint that may be different for each. \nIf you want to write up exactly what it should expect and how you're making it work and that users are happy to have that EXACT same internal auth db, I'm happy to provide the changes needed for it to work. \nThe biggest issue is that no-one can agree on that internal auth db thus making it very difficult for Kitematic to be flexible enough to auth against it. . thanks @mikeroySoft for reaching out - I think a lot of it has to do with getting machine selection integrated into kitematic- There's a wiki-page with some guidelines: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Machine-Management \nI created a small PR for a kitematic cfg/rc - which perhaps maybe an easier route to get vmware fusion up and going? https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/992\n. A big thank you to @mikeroySoft for allowing me to work on this fully. \nconfig file setup should be something like .kitematicfg in your user's home directory:\n{\n    \"driver\": \"vmwarefusion\",\n    \"name\": \"dockerfuse\",\n    \"memory\": \"1024\",\n    \"vbinstall\": false\n}\nDescription:\n- driver: the docker-machine compatible driver (should work with all driver supported by docker-machine)\n- name: name of the vm to use\n- memory: the ram that can be allocated to the vm\n- vbinstall: true/false on installing VirtualBox. Not having VirtualBox installed, setting this option to false and using virtualbox as the VM driver is obviously going to create some issues.\nIf some of you feel like doing a bit of QA on confirming that their vmware fusion VM works with this Kitematic patch, I'd appreciate it:\nhttps://github.com/FrenchBen/kitematic/tree/cfg-vm\nOne option which has been discussed is adding support for the 'none' driver option in docker-machine, allowing the user to specify a Docker-friendly url. Thoughts?\nDISCLAIMER: the above github code is provided \"as-is\" and considered to be for \"advanced\" users. I'm not responsible for any loss of data, destruction of your VM/laptop/house/relationship/pet/etc.; do praise me however if it worked as expected.\n. @felixphew @dekobon Always providing the docker URL creates the assumption that the VM has already been created with proper settings. The docker URL is unknown until the VM is created, which I thought was the original request (use 'xxxx' driver instead of virtualbox)\nFurthermore, if just a URL is provided you lose a lot of the nice docker-machine features, such as the ability to ssh in or have it regen the certs, since the docker-machine keys probably weren't added? (not 100% on this as I don't have machines with just URL setup)\n. @dekobon Thanks for the feedback- I'll add the docker URL support via the 'none' driver, and 'url' entry in the above JSON, to add the entry to docker-machine and get Kitematic working with it, unless someone here is against this?\n. @ianbytchek If you're familiar with compiling Kitematic from source, you can check out the latest PR: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/1161 which allows machine selection\n. @tiborvass Needs a little extra QA and we'll be ready for it :dancer: \n. Unfortunately it isn't - There was some early work done to support those, but the 'default' VM still is expected to be a Virtualbox driver and why you're seeing the error. \n. @jdickey Sorry to hear this being a pain point. It's not easy to please all 'setup', but feel free to comment in the wiki on the machine work.\n@luckydonald We rely on vbox for a proper VM setup and have it integrated for retries, reset, etc. Allowing more drivers becomes a pretty big task during the initial setup.\n. @bt there's a bit of info in the wiki under machine management. A lot of the code needs to be updated, but it'll give you an idea of general direction\n. @kane-c I appreciate the quick hack, but it would be much nicer to have a proper solution implemented. Do you think you could create a PR that does something similar?\n. Looking at the above 'pool' of test users, can some of you QA this PR?\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/1076\nIt should add support within the preference panel for any repo link. Only downfall is that if the repo isn't valid/online it will currently prevent Kitematic from loading properly. \nI don't know if there's a way to test the repo and confirm it's a proper docker repo? Any feedback/input welcome :D \n. PR https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/1076 has been updated to add a private repo test, so that Kitematic has a valid repo to use/work from.\n. @davidkarlsen A lot of moving parts not at all related with $$  - Please see https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/210#issuecomment-156252142 for details.\nClosing in favor of #210 \n. @RVN-BR if you get the latest release from this repo, it should be fixed. Toolbox needs to be updated\n. @Opticcenter with the Release of Docker for Mac/Windows, we check the native install first - If that isn't there, you have the ability to move forward and use the virtualbox installation instead. \n. The 'My Documents' folder is safely shared with all laptop installs of Docker and why it's the default. You can use a different folder, as long as you remember to enable sharing for that folder.\n. This is probably not perfect, but I was able to implement some of the above features, via the following:\nhttps://github.com/tecknix/kitematic/tree/list-images\n\nI'll need to add support for tags and such.\nAny downloaded image will show up on this tab, additionally you can now build your images from cli and see them listed within kitematic. \nThe example here is from the Static Python example:\nhttps://github.com/elyase/docker/tree/master/staticpython\nbash\n$ cd staticpython\n$ docker build -t fb/staticpy .\nFeedback is appreciated.\n. @klousiaj It's still pending in the PR - Just needs to be updated and looked at again\n. This has been released a few versions ago - Closing this issue. \n. @MicahZoltu Can you show the list of images you obtained with docker images ?\n. @MicahZoltu Thanks for the info - I'll try to replicate on my end and will report back. \nps: it may be that it's bombing on the dangling images. Can you try to remove those?\ndocker rmi $(docker images -q -f \"dangling=true\")\n. @d3v1an7 the VM that kitematic uses is called 'default' - Change your .bashrc to:\nbash\nif [ $(type -P docker-machine) ]; then eval $(docker-machine env default); fi\n. This could be solved via the networking feature discussed here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1249\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. @okonon there's currently a Beta for deploying Docker on AWS\nhttps://www.docker.com/products/docker#/AWS\n. @pkris001 thanks for sharing - Please keep in mind that it means that you're now exposing all of your services to the 'world'. @d4rkd0s some spamming/phishing which has now been deleted.. @deenaik deleting the folder is an essential 'reset' of everything you've setup and destroying the VM as well. This can leave a mess, as Virtualbox more than likely didn't not remove the VM from its records and may cause issues\n. There's currently a PR for Local image support: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/882\nThis would allow you to build the image locally and then find it in Kitematic. Would this be sufficient for now?\n. closing in favor of your other issue. As of Kitematic v0.8.4 you can edit ports for containers if you're unhappy with the port it uses\n. @amiracam See our docs on export and import:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import/\n. @siremurray IMHO this is more of a docker-machine setup/change than a kitematic change. \nIf you look @timbrandin how-to, it's all done via changes on the VM. Nothing to do with Kitematic (although it uses the vm/docker-machine)\n. @zedtux There's a similar PR in place, which seems to also remove some of the Virtualbox quirkiness available here: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1202\nJust a thought.\n. As mentioned before, there's a different PR now open for this, see: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/376#issuecomment-159430473\n@zedtux's PR was closed in favor of 1202\n.

This should fix the issue.. Closing this issue due to the lack of activity and in favor of #764 \n. @moimael There are still a few things we'd like to iron out prior to a merge, which breaks down to the following (@zedtux can correct these):\n- Fix about menu\n- Alert the user that docker isn't installed or the daemon isn't running\n- Implement packaging (RPM support)\n- x-term-emulator? (currently only the pre-defined terminal is supported)\n. @caske33 :+1:  :100:\n. @zedtux Totally understandable.\nThe summary wasn't to put pressure on you, but rather explain why it wasn't merged yet. \n. @moimael I think most of the issues have been ironed out - unfortunately this branch is quite behind master and needs to be updated first with proper Travis CI build checks. \nThe remaining piece is creating the proper RPM install media for it. Feel free to help get this back up to date and packaged :)\n. @zedtux thanks for the quick turn-around as always :+1:\nI'll boot up a new ubuntu machine to QA it again.\n. @zedtux Haven't had a chance to boot up a new machine - I'm hoping to do that this week. \n. Installed it on Elementary OS (ubuntu-like os) via:\nbash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.26.1/install.sh | bash\ncurl -o- https://get.docker.com/ | sh\nadd current user to 'docker' group (this allows non-sudo command and is given by the above script) - restart is needed to make it work\nbash\nnvm install v0.10.40\ngit clone -b linux-support https://github.com/zedtux/kitematic.git\nnpm install\nThe install failed with:\ngyp WARN install got an error, rolling back install\ngyp ERR! configure error \ngyp ERR! stack Error: connect ECONNREFUSED\ngyp ERR! stack     at errnoException (net.js:905:11)\ngyp ERR! stack     at Object.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:896:19)\ngyp ERR!

I also noticed some files were flagged as modified by the 'watch' process even though I didn't edit any of them. \nDid you see any similar behavior in your setup?\nLastly, it seems that there was no menu bar integration?\n. thanks @timfallmk could be the wonky gtk giving me issues - I'm reinstalling all now\n. thanks @zedtux!! All checks passed - I'll do one last round of QA myself and hopefully we can see this merged asap! :D \n. Thanks! taking a look now and will push to see this merged today\n. @zedtux Did a quick pull from kitematic master with your Linux branch and found the following files not merged:\n- package.json\n- src/browser.js\n- src/utils/DockerMachineUtil.js\nLooks like your branch was merged 4 days ago, but some changes were made afterwards. I can create a branch on my side, but it may be cleaner for you to do it? Let me know.\n. I merged the latest master on PR #1143  - Going to close this in favor of the more up-to-date branch.\nThanks again @zedtux for putting all of this together. Now I need to figure out a package setup to create the proper .rpm\n. ~~Sorry @zedtux since you did all of the heavy lifting I wanted to lighten up the last few merges - We can re-open this one if you prefer? I noticed there was yet another merge for pagination and auto-updater.~~\nActually scratch that. I've re-opened this one. Go ahead and make all of the updates and we'll merge it. \n. I think we can add 1 more check with the Setup logic, see here:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/src/utils/SetupUtil.js#L60\nYou can add a small check for the daemon and confirm it's running with something like:\nps ax | grep 'docker daemon' | awk '{ print substr($5, length($5)-9)}'\nAnd verify that the above returns something like: bin/docker\n. :+1: :clap: I'll do some QA and will report back. Thanks for doing all of this!\n. LGTM - One small request, is it possible to add a button, similar to the 'Get Toolbox' button when the daemon is not running?\nSee: https://github.com/zedtux/kitematic/blob/linux-support/src/components/Setup.react.js#L87\nbut make it a link to the Docker Linux install\n. Yup I think that would be an easy way to help people navigate to the right place. If you want to push it, I'll do some QA and hopefully get it all merged!\n. LGTM - Any chance you could squash all of your commits into 1 instead of the current 33?\n@jeffdm @mchiang0610 PTAL\n. @ryanleesipes A couple of changes needed to happen as noted above and it should be ready to be merged.\n. Woohoo!!! Congrats @zedtux for pushing on this. All merged now :tada: \n. @r4j4h Unfortunately not all DNS are made equal - In your case it seems that your ISP's DNS isn't up to par. Using Google's DNS helps quite a bit (probably why they created the service in the first place)\n. @tylerhjones thanks for the detailed info. \nThe 192.168 network is created by VirtualBox, which may not forward the TCP packet.\n. #closing as most users would use the CLI if they are doing some debugging.\nThank you for taking the time to implement this as there's a chance we'll re-use the code in the future if this comes up again. :)\n. @zedtux Would you mind bringing this branch up to date with master so that I can do some QA and hopefully see it merged?\n. More than fine by me! Let me know when you get some progress updating the latest Linux branch.\n. @xkidro Symlinks wouldn't work as Kitematic checks the path of the volume to confirm it's in the 'Users' directory, which matches the VM settings. \nMay need to leverage the VM tools to determine what folders are being shared?\n. @virgafox Kitematic shouldn't do anything different than the CLI.\nDid you create the container via the command line? If so, can you share the command arguments you used to create the container? \n. @virgafox Thanks for the break down of the issue, which I was able to replicate. I found the source of the #bug and will be pushing a create a patch/PR soon to get this fixed!\n. I believe you'll be able to download the latest toolbox and run the installer from it. \n. Closing as logs have been fixed in the recent versions of Kitematic\n. Although it's not very well document, as support isn't 100% yet, Kitematic does check for local environment endpoints before using it's hard-coded path.\nOne could set its registry as such and Kitematic would read from it:\nexport REGHUB2_ENDPOINT=\"http://my.docker.repo\"\n. @michaelwilde I actually made this possible in this PR https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/1076\nJust need someone to help QA ;)\n. @michaelwilde \nClone the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/FrenchBen/kitematic/\nUse the private-repo branch (https://github.com/FrenchBen/kitematic/tree/private-repo)\nnpm install\nnpm start\nYou should be able to navigate to the preference panel where you can update the link to the docker hub of choice.\n\n. @steve-jansen good point - I thought the check would work as debian is a pretty common image. What I didn't realize is that a lot of the registry API calls will be different and thus the branch isn't going to work as expected. There's a lot more work to be done to get this working properly.\n. @michaelwilde Absolutely! I see it as something like yum repos, where multiple channels can be added allowing for a greater range of images to be selected.\n. @elft3r Thanks for taking a look - The changes were made with a different mindset then what you and @timfallmk came up with. \nI like the separation of the drivers and ability to also create the appropriate machine from Kitematic. We'll probably need to review the proper approach, but the code created was a good example of managing existing docker machines\n. Possible ##feature##\n- Show list of images\n- Allow delete of images\n. @ChrisCinelli Nothing was assumed, 4.x was the confirmed working version of VBox and 5.0 was just release, which caused the overwrite. \nA patch will be created to include support for 5.x and notify the user if a previous version is being over-written.\n. @hrathod Thank you for the feedback - There's a docker-machine  RC that allows VBox 5 support, see:\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/pull/1496\nThe one currently shipped with Kitematic does not and will need to be updated once the RC is moved to stable.\n. This is now available using Docker for Mac/Windows\n. What OS? Kitematic Version?\nDid you previously have docker tools installed?\nAny VirtualBox versions previously installed?\nThanks\n. With the window open and the Kitematic menu shown, you can toggle the dev tools, by going to 'View > Toggle DevTools\" (looks like chrome dev tools), but will not always have information about the error. \nIn your case it looks like the app failed to initialize, it's possible that an error could've been generated.\n. What versions of docker are you running?\nCan you run the following from a command line (click 'Docker CLI' button on the bottom left corner)\ndocker version\ndocker-machine version\n. Thanks for the update - Do you mind closing the issue if it's currently resolved?\n. @carljmosca You can do setup your docker environment in 2 ways:\n- Click the 'Docker CLI' button on the bottom left of Kitematic\n- From a terminal window, with the docker command tools installed, run: eval \"$(docker-machine env dev)\" \n  You may need to verify that 'dev' is the proper name for your Virtualbox Machine via docker-machine ls\n. The eval \"$(docker-machine env dev)\" actually does this for you - you do not need to do the source ...\n. @carljmosca can you provide me with the output of the following commands:\n- docker-machine ls\n- env | grep DOCKER\n- docker-machine env dev\n. What versions of docker are you running?\nCan you run the following from a command line (click 'Docker CLI' button on the bottom left corner)\ndocker version\ndocker-machine version\n. Do you have a special theme in place? Windows 7?\n. @boosis Sorry but this feature is currently not available. Feel free to implement it and create a pull request for it :D \nOut of curiosity, what parameters do you usually pass via command line? I may be able to put something together.\n. Can you provide the full docker run command you use? It shouldn't be too hard to add support for it.\nGlad to hear Kitematic is fulfilling your Docker needs :)\n. @boosis if you want to give it a try:\nhttps://github.com/TeckniX/kitematic/tree/advance-dns\n. @boosis make sure that you are compiling the 'advance-dns' branch - the master isn't kept updated so that it's easier for me determine what is compiled (aka no advance tab) ;)\n. Some of the spacing was a little off, but I did add the .localhost and .dev to my code. Thanks for the PR.\nI'd like to see a bit more QA on it, I may send a PR to the kitematic team :)\n. @klousiaj there isn't much demand for it and thus wasn't integrated - A PR had been created but there wasn't much interest/feedback on it. \nClosing for now - if you feel there is a need for it, please create a Feature proposal. \n. Closing this issue due to the lack of activity and in favor of pending feature #1260 \n. The VM created is actually a dynamic disk VM which will grow as needed - The default location will be what ever you have selected within VirtualBox for all of your VM creations, which can be found inside the VirtualBox app under:\nVirtualBox > Preferences.. > Default Machine Folder\n. @atbrew If you desire to do so, you can install the same docker-machine version via the File -> Install Docker Commands menu.\nHaving more granularity on the VM size is on the roadmap, as seen in the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki\n. That's the Goal of kitematic - Although going over 20GB in containers/images I feel isn't the typical setup. \nOut of curiosity, how many containers/images do you have?\n. Why not map volumes for the dataset instead of adding them to the VM, shouldn't that help reduce the size? Great blog post and explanation btw. \nAdding support for Dockerfile + compose is in the Feature request list - Just need some dev time to get it implemented.\nPs: I created that 'portable app' branch and now realize the link between all this ;) \n. @psychemedia The idea is for them to map the volume and just fire up the container without having to import anything.\nThink of it like this, your db folder within your VM would be the same as the db folder within the user's desktop - Which means that the container would start up and see the data as it left it, just on the user desktop instead of within the VM. (to keep the VM lean)\nOtherwise you can have it all in one place, only suggesting an alternate route so that you're not carrying a 20+GB VM\n. I forgot what DB you're using, but it could be the dreaded UID issue, where MongoDB (for example) expects the DB files to be MongoDB owned.\n. @leebenson I think for 'most' users, 20GB is usually enough - In your case, you're working with a lot of data and could re-create the default VM to have a larger disk size that fits your purpose. \n. @leebenson Unfortunately VirtualBox doesn't provide a simple 'click' option to resize the disk image, but take a look at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11659005/how-to-resize-a-virtualbox-vmdk-file for suggestions\n. @leebenson @kieranblight If you feel the disk space is an issue, simply re-create a new 'default' vm with more room:\nCreate 100GB VM:\ndocker-machine -D create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-disk-size \"100000\" default\n. I did thanks for noticing - fixed\n. I actually use ZSH on my OSX and never had any issues - the 'bash' command you see there is just to run the docker export style commands, it should load your default shell otherwise.\nCan you explain the issue this fixes?\n. What PATH are you referring to? CLI are installed in /usr/local/bin, which I thought all shell PATH used?\n. Tried this patch with the latest master branch and it didn't work for me - @phersh Would you mind checking?\nThanks\n. #closing in favor of recent releases and the fact that the current kitematic release works perfectly in my zsh\n. Please take a look at this PR and provide feedback\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/843\n\n. Thanks for the feature request.\nThere are two PR currently under review that bring the Port edit and Volume edit when none are provided to Kitematic. \n. Closing this issue due to the lack of activity and in favor or pending PR\n. LGTM\n. The 'Enable all volumes' shows up when you click the folder  - If no volume was defined in the dockerfile/image then Kitematic can't assume any mounting point. \n\nThere's a current discussion on custom volume mapping:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/722\nOnce that PR has been updated with the latest changes you'll be able to map your custom volumes\n. #closing due to lack of interest in DNS settings\n. Thanks for the bug report - it seems that the docker hub changed their response format slightly which broke the tags selection- I've pushed a fix here:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/840\n. Please see the wiki about possible fix:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#cannot-download-imageconnect\n. @timfallmk Can you check why a lot of the Travis CI are failing and get those to pass?\n. Thanks @timfallmk for all the work on this - I will be closing this in favor of #696 as it's the most used PR as of now\n. 1. What did you try?\n2. What did you get? \n3. What did you expect?\n. @sputnik62 It looks like you have a custom setup for your current user? Is your home directory mounted to an external drive?\nCan you list the content of the .docker folder?\nls ~/.docker/machine/machines/dev/\n. @DRuffer If you'd like you can also open VirtualBox and remove the Kitematic created VM. \n. @Rocklviv if you're getting 'OS type not recognized' from docker-machine it means that the VM wasn't properly created\nCan you provide us with the output of:\ndocker-machine ls\n. @serhiypal thanks for sharing - Glad this solution also worked for you.\n. Closing as changes are now working properly\n. @coltonoscopy Does the image have the above ports declared in the Dockerfile via 'EXPOSE' ?\nAll of the -e parameters can be set within the container's General tab, under Environment variables. \nCustom port editing/mapping is still a work in progress. If you have them created during the initial docker run they should be retained after changes to the general settings (environment)\n. The 'random' default port mapping in Kitematic is in place to prevent port conflicts. If you map them during the initial creation, they should remain mapped afterwards.\nPerhaps you could create a compose file for your student to use as a base, then use Kitematic to do the rest of the config?\n. @coltonoscopy I don't think you can force the port-mapping of the images. Compose is simply to organize all images that would be built/linked on the system along with port maps, see:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/compose/\nYour compose file could be as simple as:\nweb:\n  image: nginx\n  ports:\n   - \"5050:5050\"\n   - \"8080:8080\"\n  volumes:\n   - .:/code\n  links:\n   - redis\nredis:\n  image: redis\n. You're welcome :+1: \nPort mapping/editing should be added soon to Kitematic, so keep an eye on the release details\n. Latest changes include @Elesant's designs\n\n. :+1: \nFixed by https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/853\n. Is this on Windows?\n. Some of the 403 generated errors are triggered when you are logged in to your Docker Hub account, but did not validate your account. \nI see from the screenshot that you were logged in, could it be that you validated your account after the fact, which allowed the images to be downloaded in the background?\n. Thanks for the feedback/observations @krishnazure - I'll see how we can improve some of this process. \n. @nathanleclaire when you say 'on CLI' you mean logged in to the actual VM? Otherwise I don't think the volume mapping would work from a regular OSX terminal?\n. I agree that this needs some work/refactoring. \nKitematic already does the host path check hacky solution, when you go through the UI to mount the Volume. \nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/53f74e6f56f669e5778cc7a54123dc0add823b46/src/components/ContainerSettingsVolumes.react.js#L19\nWe're already seeing this also with custom User paths/mounts which fail, due to them not being under /Users/\n. Closing this issue due to the lack of activity and in favor of volume management PR\n. Per the docs, this is normal:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/\n. Should this be something where the docker daemon broadcasts to all 'listeners' a reboot/restart event?\nA bit like how centOS/redhat will broadcast a msg to all SSH terminals that a reboot is imminent?\n. @lemonkoala The latest Kitematic will look for a VM labelled default - The above issue has also been fixed; once the default VM is up and running then the startup should be close to instant. \n. Not a kitematic issue, but a docker issue - Please close and re-open in docker :)\n. @kudos is this on the nightly build? We previously saw some issues with the nightly, see:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/729\n. @kudos To keep the list of PR clean I'm going to close this until iTerm has the stable release out - Thank you for providing this awesome patch; chances are we'll re-use it in the future when iTerm 2.9 is released\n. @kudos no problem - I'll make sure to bring this back to life. I use iTerm on the daily (just not the nightly) so it will be pretty obvious when it breaks. :P \n. As previously mentioned the idea behind the delay was to prevent adding code on nightly that was possibly never going to make it to beta/RC - Seeing the behavior in Beta is a good indication that it will make it to RC and release - I've re-opened this PR, but would like other people to try it if possible?\n@grempe and @petems could you replace your terminal file with the one in this PR?\nShould be as easy as Opening /Applications/Docker Toolbox/Kitematic (Beta).app/Contents/Resources/resources and replacing the terminal file with the one from kudos.\nPlease provide feedback here. \n. :+1: Just need @petems to also confirm and I'll get it merged. \n. Thanks everyone for your patience, QA and above all thanks to @kudos for the work. \nMerging.. \n. Thanks for chiming in @gnachman and also for being considerate enough to have a check in place for this. \nI checked the latest release of kitematic and it has the above merged code. The quick-start terminal may need to be tweaked slightly, which is on the toolbox side of things. It looks like there's an issue opened for this, I'll try to breath some life into it internally:\nhttps://github.com/docker/toolbox/issues/348\n. I'll get the toolbox version bumped - I was hoping a couple of pending PR would be merged prior to the inclusion into Toolbox. \n. closing with @Fahrradflucht's input validating this.\n. Although it seems confusing at first, what you're seeing here 0.0.0.0:32769->27017/tcp is that your port 32769 is mapped to the 27017 port within the container. Which is what the port 32769 is shown as open.\nTherefore, you should be able to connect to your mongo db via: 192.168.99.100:32769\n. Unfortunately I don't use the Windows GUI, but the menu Preferences in OSX, can also be found within the Kitematic GUI - If you look at the bottom left of the Kitematic window, you can see a small 'gear' icon, which will show you the preferences window. \n. Just downloaded the latest kitematic, allowed it to create a brand new docker-vm and selected postgres from the recommended containers. \nNo problem installing/running it. \n\n. :+1: Good to hear - Can you go ahead and close this issue since it was resolved?\n. I think a tooltip would be an easier solution than resizing the sidebar at this point in the app. It would also mimic the current look and feel for the image/repo tooltip\n. @swdgit Do you have a link to said UI standards ?. @swdgit thanks for documenting the different links available - The tomkp split pane sounds like the proper approach.\nFeel free to submit a PR with these changes in :). @ruurd What do you mean by 'green animated icon' ?\nI think a lot of the CPU processing is actually due to the web-preview and constant polling of event (log heavy->kitematic heavy). We've had a few discussions around it but nothing has been really set in stone as to a solution. Any suggestion is appreciated.\n. I can't seem to re-create a 30% spike to see what you're seeing. Can you share what exact image you're running and if there are any settings that should be modified?\nIf you think the 'green animation' is eating at your CPU, remove them and see if you still see the CPU spike. \n. I see what you mean - The animation is using the CSS animation transitions, which seems to be shown as taxing the CPU when it should be taxing the GPU.\nIt's a pretty low-priority right now, but feel free to send a PR that improves this. \n. @gvlx Please see this possible fix in the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#kitematic-vm-stuck-at-99\n. From the terminal you have here:\n\nCan you check the IP address of the VM and paste the details here?\ndocker@docker:~$ ip addr\n. From outside the VM can you ping the 192.168.99.100 ?\n. What docker image where you using? Do you have a link to its details on the docker hub?\n. Do you have the docker commands installed? If so, could you issue the following and post the results here:\ndocker-machine --version\ndocker-machine ls\ndocker version\n. but the 'hello-world-nginx' container was created properly?\n. I was able to replicate this #bug looks like the docker variables aren't being set properly.\nIn the meantime, you can fix this by running:\neval \"$(docker-machin env docker-vm)\"\nthen to exec into the container:\ndocker exec -it hello-world-nginx sh\n. @liangchaob @miguelqvd can you guys share your ENV vars (use set at the command line)\n- after clicking on the 'Docker CLI' button from Kitematic \n- after running the eval \"$(docker-machine env docker-vm)\" \nThanks\n. @liangchaob set is the same as env (or similar) - If you look at the ENV output, you have the proper variables setup after eval \"$(docker-machine env docker-vm)\" (it's normal that it doesn't output anything).\nBut you can check that everything went well via: env | grep -i \"docker\"\nYou'll see these, as you have posted above:\nbash\nDOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376\nDOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=docker-vm\nDOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/alan/.docker/machine/machines/docker-vm\nDOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\nSince all of your Docker vars are now setup, you can list all running containers via: docker ps or docker images to see all downloaded images.\n. @liangchaob If your env is setup correctly (aka you ran the docker-machine command above) you should be fine. Unless you installed different version manually?\n. A lot of this work has been superseded by other branch - #closing to prevent confusion. Thanks everyone for sharing the cool Hackathon work!\n. :+1: \n. @moxiegirl Or all the frenchness that surrounds me! \n. I'm not sure if I understand the issue - All connection/port details are made accessible during the linking process, within the container as ENV vars. Do you have an example of your use-case and issues encountered?\n. @simoami You're missing out on the magic ;)\nYour Redis Host is connected within the container-  So instead of connecting to it via the 192.168.... you just use ENV['REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR'] as the host and ENV['REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT'] as the port in your code. You can also see that the full string is set here: ENV['REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP']\nIf you look at the /etc/hosts file, you'll see that there's even a host entry for the Redis server and it's associated with the proper IP in there. \nThe 192.168.... Ip is only if you wanted to connect to it from outside of a container. \n. no pb :+1:  - Can you close this issue if it's been resolved?\n. @timbrandin thank you for the very detailed information and great poc (along with your code PR). \nIt seems that a lot of the functionality you're putting into Kitematic already exists within other Docker products. Having 2 tools do the same thing doesn't seem like added value, unless I'm missing the bigger picture?\nHave you looked at docker-compose regular docker and docker-machine ? Your .YAML example is verbose a docker-compose YML. \nIntegrating support for a File > Open YML would make more sense, and have docker-machine parse it IMHO. \n. :+1: on supporting the docker-compose.yml - That would be huge! \nSorry you had to spend all of this time implementing CLI commands :[ \nHow do you envision the git for YML? I would see it as a user created a file in a specific folder:\nYAML\nweb:\n  image: nginx\n  ports:\n    - \"8000:8000\"\n  links:\n    - db\n  volumes:\n    - ~/configs:/etc/configs/:ro\n  environment:\n    - DEBUG=true\ndb:\n  image: postgres\nThen had kitematic open it to manage the containers and link them accordingly. \n. LOL I can tell you went to town with it :+1:  - Glad we both agree on the need for docker-compose to be supported, feel free to create an early PR for it ;)\n. @timbrandin You've seen the light ;) and pointed to exactly what's currently working/being used.\nMore than the cli to open a Kitematic window (you should only run 1) I see value in opening a directory (and tracking that dir) from Kitematic and run docker-compose against it.\n. @timbrandin A lot of this has now been integrated into the docker CLI tools, which is the preferred usage. \nI do like the ability to pass commands to kitematic via the terminal and will probably re-use some of this code.\nThanks for sharing all of your work :+1: . Feel free to join gitter if you'd like to chat :)\n. Thanks for all the comments! :+1:  I'll clean these up tomorrow :)\n. I concur on the need to make a small separation between the view and filters. Regarding the name, \"Local Images\" is fine and probably describes more accurately what the tab is. \nI'll make the proper updates and will push it up\n. I need to force a rebase on this. \n. Currently the branch has some conflicts that need to be resolved\n. Thanks for the feedback - the 'none' is an img artifact left-over from non-stop containers. Getting a list of running container and preventing image deletion may be a good solution (possibly lots of changes?)\nI'll take a look.\n. @Davidrums the cleanup of local images is a bit wonky right now (see note about the 'none') - I need to make some changes to that logic and we can then have a final review + merge\n. @kostonstyle If you look at the image information, found here:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/_/golang/\nYou can see that you can run your golang project under the /go folder as seen above in the GOPATH environment variable.\n. As the error suggests, there are 'no command specified' in the Dockerfile:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cloudspace/docker-ios-notification/dockerfile/\nIf you look at the registry information a command is required before the container can be created:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cloudspace/docker-ios-notification/\nUnfortunately there isn't an easy way for Kitematic to detect this, but it's something on the feature request.\n. What do you mean by 'Switching network'?\nI've gone from a coffee shop to my house to my office and never have any network issues (I keep the VM running at all times)\n. Looks like you're having some connection issues are you behind a proxy?\n. the 10.0.2.3 simply isn't a proper ip - see:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/718#issuecomment-115489049\n. The issue seems to be with the Virtualbox DHCP - Not the first time I've seen it cause issue. Hopefully they'll get this fixed soon!\nThanks for the feedback\n. thanks for the rep @michaelwilde :+1: \n. @estheryou All jupyter images should be available from the Docker hub, see:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/jupyter/\nYou can search for them via kitematic\n. jupyterhub isn't a project that we support - Please see their github:\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub\n. Since these issues are unrelated to kitematic, can you close it and https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/892 also?\nThanks\n. Do you get the same issue when you do:\ndocker pull ipython/scipyserver\n. There are quite a few images for docker-oracle-xe-11g - Can you post a link to the one you used?\n. @VilhoRaatikka Looking at the error, it seems to be related to the image itself - Not much we can do on our end. \nFeel free to fork the repo and make the appropriate changes to get it up and working:\nhttps://github.com/alexei-led/docker-oracle-xe-11g\n. You can try and apply the patch currently available within the VB tickets and linked to here:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#kitematic-vm-stuck-at-99\n. @barhun Thanks for the link - There's actually a few steps laid out within the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#kitematic-vm-stuck-at-99-or-cannot-pull-images under 'Windows 10'\n. The CLI should be loading your default shell - How did you assert that the .bash_profile wasn't loaded?\n. Closing this due to lack of feedback. Please re-open if needed.\n. @Aliance sourcing during build, does nothing.\nRun it as part of your CMD or simply move it to a location BASH is looking for. . #closing hoping to get a more integrated solution in place and a cleaner grouping of containers created via compose\n. @iBobik If you look in the wiki, you'll see that a lot of this is document in the up-coming machine changes:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Machine-Management\nIf you use Kitematic a lot, it's actually nice to open it with the VM already running or close it and keep working with your containers without Kitematic open (aka VM still running) \n. Although perhaps not clear, the wiki does in fact talk about UI changes as you mentioned, where the VM status would be shown and allow you to start/stop it.\nUnfortunately until the VM is up and running there isn't much you can do, as it's the main repository for all of your containers.\n. The page you are looking at is a simple 'Readme' file, has nothing to do with the available tags. \nIf you want to compare tags for tags, then you need to look at the tags page/tab:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/library/php/tags/\nThis isn't a bug, just documentation of non-existing tags. \n. @iBobik Looks like a paging situation - we only show the latest as seen on the hub link above. \nThere's a similar feature on the search result that is to be implemented. \n. Kitematic displays the exact same information as seen on the website, thus not a true issue, but a feature request yes )\n. @ganiutomo As you clearly showed, the default is the 10 results you see there. The url you provided isn't the user-friendly website I mentioned, but the actual API for that image.\nChanges have been made to allow the page size increase you mentioned (noticed the url is v2?) These are changes that can now be supported in Kitematic. \n. @nolsen311 What was the output of the osascript command?\nps: latest stable is showing 2.1.1 - https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html\nThe nightly/test is what you seem to be running, I'm not sure we can include a fix for all of their nightly/test builds.\n. Maybe I'm missing what you'd like to see in the .bash_profile?\n. @meyera Can you run the following from a command prompt?\nvboxmanage --version\n. @granthbr What was the name of your previous VM?\nThe latest build will look for a VM labeled 'default' - Allowing the user to select the VM is part of the future improvements, see:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Machine-Management\n. @oliverhr A lot of this is part of the on-going Machine Management task. \nIt's all features we'd like to see happen sooner than later; if you'd like to get started on the implementation of the VM selection, feel free to look through the link above :)\n. What OS and Kitematic version are you using?\n. Are you able to download Virtualbox Manually?\n. Please see the new toolbox tool to install it all :)\nhttps://www.docker.com/toolbox\n. I don't believe this is a kitematic issue but more of a mirror setting within the control panel. Did you try to tweak some of the settings?\n. @thomasvogel we actually use the electron app type messages - Do you get a similar message with the Atom editor?\n. Closing this issue due to the lack of activity in more than 15 days\n. #close - looks like your issue has been explained in the docker/toolbox#77\n. @pradhyu Are you behind a proxy?\n. Are you mounting a volume for your container? If so can you list the containers you are using and the volumes mounted?\n. @VelizarVESSELINOV The refresh option exists, although it's kind of hidden - If you click again on any of the 'filter' tabs it should refresh the page for you.\n. Perhaps we can add a 'refresh' icon to the tab when it's active? What did you have in mind?\n. Closing this due to lack of activity in more than 15 days. Adding a refresh is in the works but from the menu\n. A lot of manual work actually :sweat_smile: \n. @VelizarVESSELINOV Can you provide a bit more detail, I'm not sure if I follow what you mean\n. #feature - Add advance filtering on images\n. #feature \n. Closing this due to lack of activity in more than 15 days. If interest is there, please submit it as a feature request with details on how you see it working. \n. @mercuriete Feel free to create a proper Feature proposal that details where it would live, how it would be implemented and what it would show.\n. @gurlinthewurld boot2docker has been retired in favor of docker-machine.\nDid you do a fresh install via the Docker Toolbox? https://www.docker.com/toolbox\n. @gurlinthewurld Did you try to simple reset the password on the account? https://hub.docker.com/reset-password/\n. I think the 'up to 24hrs' is just the industry standard - I'm hoping that the reset will force an email to be kicked out for both the reset and then an acknowledgement of your account being valid :)\n. @gurlinthewurld :+1: Glad to hear this was resolved. Thanks for the feedback. \n. @janvladimirmostert Port editing as well as Volume editing is an upcoming feature but is currently in Kitematic. \nIf you're familiar with the docker command line, you can create your own image, based on the current container setup and re-create the container with the added ports and volume mapping.\n. Port editing is part of the latest Kitematic - Closing this as the Volume management PR is also pending.\n. Looks like an issue with the VM setup - I just create a MySQL container without any issues. Can you retry?\n. Are you behind a proxy? It looks like the docker.io site is mapping to a localhost IP which shouldn't be the case.\n. @moloch-- It should, but the DNS lookup happens in the VM first. If you happen to be behind a proxy or have some slightly customized routing, it seems that Virtualbox looses connectivity. \nIf you look in the wiki, there's a quick how-to DNS to make sure that your resolve settings allow the images to be downloaded. \n. #close - This seems to be a Dockerfile/Docker issue. Please only create issues for Kitematic here. \nSee this blog post on a proper Rails development environment for docker:\nhttp://blog.codeship.com/running-rails-development-environment-docker/\n. How are you 'making' kitematic build this image?\nIs there a github repo with the entire project files? If I made a copy of your Dockerfile in a local dir, only the Dockerfile would be copied, since that's the only thing that exists in that dir. \n. #close - duplicate of https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/947\nSee Wordpress documentation here: https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/\n. Same as #947; it is assumed that the developer will read the documentation associated with the container and that all requirements will be met. \nAs you can see on the hub there are countless images and ways to set something up, relying on Kitematic to determine the dependencies is difficult. \nFor argument's sake, I added a proposal for Dockerfile improvements to support dependencies. https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/15700\n. For example, you could determine that this image is a better setup for you, as it has everything built-in:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/tlongren/docker-wordpress-nginx-ssh/\n. I see what you're saying, and you are correct that there is no 'magic' behind Kitematic, just a helper for docker command line. \nDocker Compose is a feature requested often - I actually created a PR to make this happen:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/898\nI don't currently know of a Compose registry - It would be nice to have a list of compose 'recipes' available that Kitematic could use - Perhaps that would be better than simple image pull\n. As indicated by the logs and shown in the documentation (https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/), you need to create an environment variable of MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD - This can be done in Kitematic under the 'Settings > General' tab. \nps: the title of your issue is misleading as the install worked since you can see the logs - Starting it is where you're experiencing issues, which the above will fix. \n. @wkoszek I would normally agree with providing some feedback, but there is no way Kitematic can account for any requirements detailed in the documentation. \nIMHO It's assumed that a user will read the documentation pertaining to the container they are trying to create/use and that the software shouldn't be in charge of these requirements. \nIt's similar to opening/starting a car without a key; the vehicle doesn't tell you that a key is missing, you have learnt that to open/start a car you need a key. (although new keyless start message to be better at this)\n. @wkoszek if you want to join Gitter, I'd be happy to chat :) - As you mentioned there isn't much in the Dockerfile that explains that MySQL is required for this image to work. \nAdditionally Kitematic just hands off the workload to the docker client (aka similar to you running docker pull manually in a terminal) - As mentioned before I've opened up the discussion to have that be part of the Dockerfile, which may help Kitematic connect all the dots. \nTo your TV analogy, you would still need to know that the TV cables need to be plugged in - How would you know to do that?\n. close: not an issue\n. close as duplicate of https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/952\n. close as duplicate of https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/952\n. @sabuva How are you trying to remove the container?\n. @sabuva Thanks for the feedback - This you opened this issue, you can actually hit the 'Close' button below :+1: \n. Just created one from the latest and got the volumes - What did you do differently then clicking 'Create'?\n\n. @wmgeorge @bettyjunod Can you both try to remove any existing VMs prior to re-trying the setup?\nwhich docker-machine   (confirm it's installed in the /usr/local/bin/docker-machine so all commands below work)\nbash\ndocker-machine ls\ndocker-machine rm <machine name from above>\nexample:\ndocker-machine rm default\nThen try to run kitematic again and let it setup the machine. \n. The container seems to have been 'updating' - What parameters did you change that caused this issue?\nAlso what image did you use? I can't seem to find a matching 'centos:5' image - Kitematic only shows 'centos:5.11'.\n. Was this installed from the Toolbox?\nI was able to start both without issues using the Toolbox intaller: https://www.docker.com/toolbox\n. Can you both confirm the version of VirtualBox installed on your windows machine?\n. @garyrutland @demohi @toqueteos Could you check the system logs as seen in this issue?\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/issues/1723\nCheck /var/log/system.log for a line that looks like:\nkernel[0]: vboxdrv: Bad CPU context error at line 4886 in SUPDrv.cpp: EFLAGS.AC is 0!\n. @garyrutland thanks for the feedback on this working :+1:  - It's difficult for us to push for a 'test' version integration; we'll replicate the test to confirm everything is working and hope that VirtualBox will push it out to the stable branch here soon. \nLink to Virtualbox added to wiki.\n. thanks for the update @mishgunn :+1: \n. Can you visit the url: https://api.github.com/repos/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases\nand confirm that you get the JSON output?\n. If you can see it, I would go ahead and delete the VM and retry setup - Maybe the I/O timeout was just a hiccup\n. @fusengine would you mind sharing your setup:\n- OS version\n- Kitematic/Toolbox version\n- Number of containers\n- Any special linking/processes tied up with these containers.\nAlso out of curiosity do you have a snapshot of your activity monitor showing Kitematic as the culprit of this bottleneck (slowness)?\nCan you upload your ~/.docker/machine/machines/default/default/Logs/VBox.log so that we can check the I/O operations and perhaps detect why it seems so slow for you?\n. I have virtualbox 5.0.2 and Kitematic runs without any issues. Where did it not work for you @fusengine ?\n. @fusengine I would like to determine the cause of the error you're getting. It does however seem to be less prone to errors on 5.0.3.\nWhat error do you get when running it on 5.0.2?\n. Looks like a full-on Virtualbox bug:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/14412\n5.0.3 is the only solution. \n. @damienstanton did you start from a fresh with the reset and install of vb 5.0.3?\n. @damienstanton Thanks for the steps - I went ahead and added them to the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#machine-issues-virtualbox\n. @rwatts3 Do you mind taking it for a test drive and confirming that it works as expected?\n. Sure- this assumes you have nodejs/npm installed.\nbash\ngit clone -b port-edit https://github.com/FrenchBen/kitematic.git\ncd kitematic\nnpm install\nnpm start\nYou should see the kitematic window open up and you can play with the different port settings. \n. @siremurray Just need the team to look at it and give a thumbs up before it can be merged. \n. @andreysaksonov That's correct, the intent is to get the port editing to match your manual setup. A minimal check will be in place to prevent conflicts with ports, but it allows you to over-write the sequential port Kitematic uses\n. Are you mounting the Volume to a local folder for the postgre container? \nWindows should allow full read/write on the folder, unless windows 10 does something different?\n. @stanpalatnik who says I can't invite you? :P\n. At this time there are no proper Virtualbox solution - One work-around is to have something like:\nhttps://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev\n. #close - not a true issue\n. @wkoszek I believe this is what we discussed.\n\n. Yup the '?' will have to be added in to the image list (easy change) - For right now I re-used the same icon found on the actual image. \nHere's a screenshot of it on the 'settings' tab\n\n. Done and good catch!  We need to get lint in place ;)\n. @fusengine \nTu peux donner si possible (pour aider les autres):\n- OSX Version:\n- Kitematic Version:\n- Docker Version:\nMerci!\n. @wwkoon007 Can you take a screenshot of the issue you're having?\nDid you try to update your DNS settings?\n. @anggun-indra what version of Kitematic are you using?\n. Can you share the 'About' screen so that we know the version of software you have. \n. It looks like your rails container was created without any issues, correct?\nCan you delete the nginx-php container and see if you can re-create it?\nAlso can you share your logs? .docker/machine/machines/default/default/Logs/Vbox.log\n. Glad you were able to solve this, although it's unfortunate you had to remove all of your VMs for that to happen. \nFrom your description it sounds like you had previous versions installed, which may have caused some of those issues. \nIn the future, you can always check the VMs installed or remove them via:\ndocker-machine ls\ndocker-machine rm <vm-name>\nps: would you mind closing the issue since it is now resolved?\n. #close - this is a known issue if you try to pull an image where the 'latest' tag doesn't exist. \nIf you look at the docs, link under tags, you'll see it doesn't exist:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/dnvriend/fuse/tags/\nas a side note, the same thing would happen if you ran a docker pull dnvriend/fuse\n. can you provide the full error output, it looks like your message was truncated.\n. Did you create 2 containers with the same 2 ports bind? Kitematic uses random ports to prevent this from happening - Port 88 wouldn't be one of them.\n. @fusengine Si tu veux te mettre sur Gitter on peut discuter tes probl\u00e8mes. Tu es un des premiers a avoir autant de soucis. \nAs-tu customis\u00e9 qqchose de special?\n. De rien - Par curiosit\u00e9 pourrais-tu partager tes mauvaises manip et la mani\u00e8re dont tu as r\u00e9solu le probl\u00e8me?\nCa peut sans doute aider qq'un d'autres? \n. :+1: En effet ca peut creer qq problemes. Peux-tu fermer l'issue?\n. #confirmed #bug  - Thanks for filing the issue, PR should follow\n. You can always resize it within the VirtualBox app  to fit your needs.\nThe 2GB VM seems to be a pretty compromise for most setups and allows for smooth running containers on most machines.\nWith that said, there's a section in the wiki that discusses Machine/VM Management - One of the settings would allow you to pick and choose your VM size. \n. IMHO\n1) You would know it's possible if you realized to begin with that the VM was created with 2GB. Isn't that where you looked?\n2) By default the VM is shutdown when you close Kitematic, so it's really a matter of closing Kitematic, Tweak the memory in VBox then re-open Kitematic.\n. @roncanepa I'm not arguing that GUI point at all and it's also why there's a complete solution spec'd out - I was merely pointing out that for most users the default amount of ram isn't a huge problem right out of the box. \n. @jrajav it's not in Kitematic but in the pref panel of Docker for Mac/Windows. Ask and you shall receive ;)\nThere's a PR pending for that exact feature:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/882\n. @jy03189211 \n- What did you try?\n- What happened?\n- What did you expect? \n. Did you install it via toolbox?\nIf you need to reset the setup, there's a pretty handy script found here:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/util/reset\n. @alexandrev This is an old issue which has since then been fixed. It is also different from your previous issue, as it deals with spaces in the actual name of the user folder.\n. agreed - I did make some changes to it to be more of a VM selector in another PR\n. @bwidmeier I'm working on adding proper machine support into the UI, which prevents the need for this conf file :)\n. @Elesant Do you think you could provide an updated icon for this plz? :D \n. Put on the back-burner for now \n. I was able to download and delete the container without any issues - Can you quit Kitematic and re-open it to try this again?\n. @funkytaco I would use the Docker Toolbox instead of brew, as it will update everything for you. \n. @funkytaco Thank you for the great walk-through on getting things cleaned up.\nGetting a migration of containers wouldn't be impossible as we already have it for the old boot2docker - Thankfully you didn't need the containers, but it can otherwise be an issues.\nAs a side note, if you were to remove the VM to begin with, then you could've done just that and all container/images would've been removed too with it. \n. Is your VM running? I would try to close down the application and try this again. \n. @marceldiass Kitematic is now up to 0.8.3 which fixes many bugs. I would recommend upgrading via the toolbox: Docker Toolbox\n. If there is a loss of connectivity (or hub cannot be reached) it's possible that the download percentage cannot be determined; although it should probably say 0 instead of NaN. #bug \n. Sounds like it - Unfortunately the VM is a bit tricky with it's DHCP settings, and doesn't do a good job at reconnecting. \nA restart of the VM usually does the trick. Can you close this issue if you haven't had an issue since?\n. Are you behind a proxy or changed connection settings while having the VM running? Virtualbox seems to have some connectivity issues if you let it run and go from one network location to another. (aka it can't reconnect properly)\nTo make sure that kitematic and the VM are reset, within the Preferences, make sure that you have 'Shutdown Linux VM on closing Kitematic' selected and quit the application. (Cmd+Q on a Mac)\n. What OS are you on?\ndocker-machine and Kitematic use the same machine storage location; Kitematic actually uses docker-machine behind the scene.\n. Sweet!\n. I believe that Git bash cli has some issues when attaching to a container and why it wasn't selected as the shell of choice\n. Closing this due to lack of activity in more than 15 days. \n. Thanks for the feedback - There's actually some work currently being done to support the above.\nA PR was open to provide kitematic with some simple VM changes:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/992\nThere's also a break-down of machine management plans within Kitematic in the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Machine-Management\nThe rename suggestion is a dangerous one, as you would also break the VirtualBox inheritance. There are a couple of changes that also would need to happen within VirtualBox to have a 'smooth' transition.\n. Closing this due to lack of activity in more than 15 days. \n. @hferentschik just the fact that no one has commented on my reply that pointed to the Wiki in regards to machine management; along with the previous feature request which is where all of the discussion should go.\n. @omarabid Please see above comments\n. @omarabid @hferentschik The wiki simply illustrates what we've considered and the direction we'd like to take. \nUnfortunately we don't have enough man-power to help create this huge feature, while still fixing the issues seen here.\nIf one of you feels like they'd like to take a stab it, feel free to do so :D\n. @fusengine It seems you have a lot of different things touching the same volume - Is there any reason you need to have the SQL volume on your hdd? it's pretty simple to keep it in the container.\n. @mieciu Glad you were able to solve it :+1:  - Sometimes re-creating the VM is easier than the above if the VM was brand new. \n. @sabat @costimuraru Can you click on Docker CLI and scroll up the terminal, then paste the output here? (or as a gist)\n. @ranjib You need to logout then log back in for this to work. \n. @npiguet thanks for the feedback and thorough debug of this. \nPerhaps you missed the similar comment of the Docker documentation, you'll see that a mention is made about ubuntu 15.04+ and systemd:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/#configure-a-dns-server-for-use-by-docker\n. @lfilho Do you have any pre-set env vars within your .profile/.zshrc  ?\nPerhaps you're over-writing the env set by docker-machine?\nWhen you lose connectivity can you do:\nenv | grep -i docker\nping $(docker-machine ip default)\ndocker $(docker-machine config default) ps -a\ndocker $(docker-machine config default) info\nAdditionally don't use brew to do your updates. use the proper Docker Toolbox installer, to get the tools that work together and have been QA'd as such. \n. @plusmancn you're assuming with the above that they started with a new distro and installed docker on it. \nWhen we setup the VM we actually do all of that for you and thus don't need to do the above usermod\n. @click2tman Thanks for point to the docs :+1: \n. @TamimiGitHub Did you read the docs about having your user added to the proper docker group?\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group\n. Locking this as the docs explain specifically what needs to be done. \n. Kitematic displays a similar search result as seen on the following page (not sure of the order preference):\nhttps://hub.docker.com/search/?q=ipython%2Fnotebook&page=1&isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&pullCount=0&starCount=0\n. #feature - Add URL link to Home tab access url\ndibbs\n. PR #1018 should fix this - As a side note it seems this container uses HTTPS, which isn't something that can be easily detected by Kitematic. \nYou will still have to add https in front of the link once it's open and add an exception for a locally created cert. \n. @tuxknight There is already a PR #882  for this exact feature. \nclose - duplicate\n. #close - no question\n. @hongdanyang1991 What's your overall download speed? There shouldn't be any latency, unless you're behind a very specific network setup?\n. :+1:  Glad it was a quick fix\n. The error is usually linked to the missing 'latest' tag, but if you were able to pull it via the CLI then it should work as expected.\nWithout having access to the image to replicate the issue it will be pretty difficult for me to replicate. Are you experiencing the same issue with public images?\nAlso can you take a screenshot of your Kitematic > About page?\n. Not sure UX wise which is better, perhaps @Elesant can chime in?\nThe page selector does get updated with every call - The idea was to mimic the look and feel of https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=node. I'm open to suggestions for changes\n. Infinite scroll is a possibility, but currently would break due to performance issue - Until that part is revamped we'll need to keep the paging solution. \nI'll work on updating the paging to show up to 10 or add a dropdown for quick page selection? I'll see how I can make it all work smoothly and give Kitematic the edge.\n. I'll try to knock this out tomorrow.\n. @jeffdm I've made the updates as shown by @Elesant - One additional feature is the arrows now go to the first or last page, instead of previous/next page.\nThe paging only applies to the results from Hub search. Recommended/Private repo do not get paging, which is something we'll probably have to discuss/figure out. \nI also found 1 odd filter case which prevented certain results from showing up in Kitematic even though they were returned by the Hub api. I'll ping you about this to see how we want to tackle it.\n. @thaJeztah I signed the first one as I thought it to be the one that mattered the most. I can amend the last commit and sign it if you'd like?\n. @thaJeztah I signed the first one as I thought it to be the one that mattered the most. I can amend the last commit and sign it if you'd like?\n. :+1: makes sense - I'll go ahead and clean all of this up. I should've known better. \nRegarding the email address I've been skeptical about it, due to possible email harvesting of 'Signed-off-by:' part - it'd be nice if you could register your email and obtain a hash to sign your commit. \n. Latest push should fix the weird highlight that you previously saw - @jeffdm can you take a look?\n.

What does Vagrant do with your regular Virtualbox?\n. @Dmitry1987 The question was more of a 'what do you do with your Vagrant VM' - How do you use them? Do you SSH into them?

Can you check if that fixed your problem?\n. \"Kitematic app window blends into the background of other windows with white backgrounds making it often difficult to identify that it's even there or where it begins and ends. This is particularly the case when (like most devs) I have a sea of windows open. The \"no border\" trick looks cool but UX is not so cool.\"\nNo border:\n\nborder:\n\n. What version of Kitematic/toolbox are you using? Any screenshot of the issue, or just a never-ending download animation?\n. I just create a new container without any issues - What are your network settings? Are you behind a firewall?\n\n. Thanks @nevercast  for the very thorough debug issue - Could you try to login to the VM via the docker-machine cli (as you did for example)?\ndocker-machine ssh default\nAlso can you provide the output of docker-machine env default --shell powershell ?\nThe redacted part is what you found under the /c/Users/Josh/.docker folder - There's a machine folder for the certs and also an actual folder labelled default (also one for example since you created that). The  part is to prevent users from inadvertently sharing their system username (could be a sec issue)\n. The issue is the linked to the certificates that should be copied to the machine - Due to some issues with Virtualbox, these certificates are sometimes not properly copied to the VM, causing the issue that you saw. \nObviously removing the machine and re-creating it forces the certs to be created. There are a couple of issues opened/closed on docker-machine that talk about this. I'm not sure what the proper fix would be.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure why the installer steps would fail. But you're right, if the VM takes too long to be created, then it would at some point cause the error you see above. \nDoing a regen on the certs can work if to begin with the networking isn't an issue. As I'm sure you've seen in some of the threads, DHCP from VBox can be finicky and most of the time the root cause of certs not added to a VM.  \nIf you don't mind, could try and re-create the VM with the exact same cli arguments as kitematic?\ndocker-machine -D create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 2048 default\n(side-note the -D option will output a lot of debugging)\n. Was this done with the previous VM still running?\nThis part of the log makes it sound like it couldn't (or wouldn't) over-write the certs. Which could be why they're not working as expected:\nPreventing overwrite: the following files already exist: \"/var/lib/boot2docker/server.pem\" \"/var/lib/boot2docker/server-key.pem\"\nps: thank you so much for all the walk-through and clear details of steps taken and error logs. It is much appreciated. :100: \n. That's correct, machine stores all certs it has generated in .docker\\machine\\certs\\ - I don't believe they are regenerated when you create a new VM. It just uses the same ones. (it's all local aka low-risk)\nIf you want to confirm that, you can look at .docker\\machine\\machines\\default\\config.json - You'll see an entry that looks like:\njson\n\"CaCertPath\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Josh\\\\.docker\\\\machine\\\\certs\\\\ca.pem\"\nThe location above was referencing the actual VM path, where the certs are stored. Odd that it would already have them in place if you were just creating the VM.\n. Thanks for the great step by step - Your assumption is correct, the network adapter is usually at the core of the issue. (there's a couple of mentions of the steps you just took in the wiki)\nWhat usually happens is this:\nImproper connection -> Cannot connect to newly created VM -> Cannot push Certs -> Cannot Docker.\nif you're up for it, you can delete all of the Host-Only network in VirtualBox and see if the issue happens again when you create the VM (as above). Even if you uninstall VirtualBox, I think some of those host-only setups are kept within the Registry. \n. Only the first Host-Only interface is setup and used - If you go under the VM's settings > Network, you can see that the VM is using 2 adapters:\n- NAT\n- Host-Only \n. :+1:  thanks for merging this @jeffdm \n. I would restart the VM - looks like it didn't start with the proper permissions.\ndocker-machine restart default should do the trick\n. @mikaoelitiana @ClemMakesApps there's a pending PR with some bugs: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1522\nFeel free to help move it along\n. Sounds like your VM can't connect - you can check this by going into the VM and trying to ping the above link:\ndocker-machine ssh default\nping index.docker.io\n. :+1: Good to hear - Closing this for now, but feel free to re-open it if you have any more issues.\n. If you have in your preferences to 'shutdown Linux VM on closing Kitematic' checked, then you should be able to close kitematic (which shuts down the VM) and should also kill the above pending download.\n. Do you meant the ability to retry the download over and over when it fails?\n. @66beta Could you provide a bit more information on your setup? x64 windows 10?\nHow did you install the docker toolbox?\nI have yet to see this error and would like to know how I can replicate it.\n. @66beta not very familiar with Win10, hence the ignorant question :[\nHave you tried starting the .exe from the powerShell to see if there is anything outputted to the terminal?\nps: could you translate what the error says?\n. Looking at the error it seems to be related to some VS libraries - Do you have VS2015 CTP6 installed?\nSomething like:\n\n. The above C++ runtimes are what's causing the issue. I mentioned them as being the cause of the issue, not a requirement.\nTry a fresh install of Windows 10 yes, as there seem to be some conflicting libraries in your current setup. \nAs a side note it'd be great to know what you have installed and what library is getting in the way (if you can share)\n. @aaqqxx  \u8bf7\u8bf4\u82f1\u8bed :)\nGoogle translate:\n\"Sleep system, disconnected from the network, you can not execute the command, it is difficult start again, you need to restart the computer, restart the computer and sometimes several times before they can connect better\"\nVirtualbox does have some issues when waking up and making the proper connection - You shouldn't have to restart fully, you can simply execute the following in a command line:\ndocker-machine restart default\n. @alexandrev @Grabuge I would encourage you to take a look at the following thread which has some very good debug information as well as steps to get it up and running:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/1037\n.

Wouldn't the 'cfg' PR solve this for advance settings? https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/992 (at least for now)\n. @d3v1an7 the above mentioned PR does just that - It looks for any preference of docker machine and uses that for Kitematic.\n. @mmehta I believe this is what you were referring to - The new VM is now default instead of dev\n. @thiphariel The default vm is always loaded - there is currently some discussion to get the VM selection, but no definite path to do so (see the wiki)\n. Not yet - but there's a PR to do just that: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/882\nClosing for now, but feel free to re-open if needed\n. No issues described - Closing for now, but feel free to re-open it.\n. @andreabat Did you have a question/description for this issue?\n. @memeinstigator What you're missing is that the download happens within the VM, not the terminal you've opened and set the proxy to.\nCheck out the wiki section, at the bottom of it, there are steps to add proxy settings to the VM:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#add-proxy-settings-to-vm\n. Check your .bashrc or .profile within your home directory - Something may have been added from the original boot2docker install.\n. What about under System Preferences > Users & Group > Login Items ?\n. Are you behind a proxy? Could you share details of your network setup?\n. @samhe Did you look at the info in the wiki? You can try to update some of the VM proxy settings:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#add-proxy-settings-to-vm\n. v1 repo search has been removed in favor of the newer v2.\n. Screenshot of the repo preference:\n\n. #closing for not being applicable at the moment \n. I plan on doing a clean upgrade to my system over the weekend and will do QA. \nCan you provide the following output details:\ndocker-machine ls\ndocker-machine env default\ndocker-machine ip default\n. @vicary kitematic isn't the issue here, but rather a bad VM (when you ran the start, no URL was shown) - You should be able to delete the VM and re-create it. \ndocker-machine rm default\ndocker-machine -D create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory \"2048\" default\nThe above should output a LOT of debug info which may help us debug possible installation issue. Please create a gist.github.com of the log if the VM doesn't get created properly.\n. @vicary Makes sense, as machine cleans up a few additional things - Good to see you got this resolved :+1: \n. Glad this is now working as expected for you - Thanks for the feedback/how-to\n. It looks like the IP is incorrect for the URL - Are you clicking the Docker CLI within Kitematic or directly tried to connect via command line?\n. Are you behind a proxy? Some VM have trouble connecting/downloading images when the machine is setup behind a proxy.\n. Thanks for the update - Closing it as this is resolved.\n. @yarmenti Not all images are created equally and a mapped volume isn't always declared, which makes it difficult for Kitematic to know the proper location to map. \nWhat image did you download/setup and having trouble configuring a volume for?\n. Kitematic does check for volumes detailed in the Dockerfile, when you map the volume to a local folder, there is no copy of the internal data to that folder. \nIf you look under Settings > Volumes you'll see that both folders in the Dockerfile are shown:\n\nIt's assumed that you're mapping it to over-write the image settings/setup.\n. @yarmenti Not sure if I understand the request? You mean map the volume during the first start? \nWhen you map the volume Kitematic actually deletes and re-creates the container in the background. \n. @yarmenti I'm not too familiar with the openldap image - Perhaps a required config file is needed in those folders?\nMaybe check the content of the folders within the container and have a similar config in your volume folder?\n. #closing since no feedback provided over 15+ days - Please comment back on here if needed\n. This is currently not possible. Feel free to start hacking on Kitematic and add it :)\n. @leo-from-spb The api supports hostname, If you'd like to add it to Kitematic, then we'd be happy to merge the PR once done. \n. Are you logged in to the DockerHub when this happens? Did you confirm your email after signing up for DockerHub?\n. If some images work while others don't it could be a simple connectivity issue which unfortunately isn't something we can fix. \n. I don't think DockerHub allows email for username? your username should be whatever you used for DockerHub.\n. username is the preferred way - Interesting that DockerHub allows you to login with both.\n. This isn't really a 'true' issue, the tag 'latest' doesn't exist for that image, as seen here:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/maprtech/mapr-data-cent66/tags/\nIf you select the proper tag available, then it will all work - Closing in favor of https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/572\n. Instead of taking it completely out, why not make 1 quick/simple change like so:\nval.display = (val.display) ? val.display : val.ip + ':' + val.port;\n. Exactly, being able to determine what the container is serving is difficult - We can look at port numbers and make an educated guess, but most of the time the user will know better. \nThe sample code I provided was to illustrate a lighter change that may support the val.display should it ever not be empty. If it was added once, it's possible that the API used to respond to it and could be used in the future (aka future proof change). \nEither way I think the change is needed, even though it forces the user to copy & paste the text displayed\n. #closing this PR as it's out-dated but I will implement the solution in one of the existing PR that should be merged.\nThanks for sharing the code to re-use. I'll make sure to mention you in the PR that will have the changes.\n. LGTM\n. Hi @kkresek-mentor - not sure why Virtualbox was having issues, did you previously have VirtualBox installed?\nTo get a better idea of what's going on, would you mind creating the machine by hand via the PowerShell/GitBash?\ndocker-machine rm default\ndocker-machine -D create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory \"2048\" default\n. Thanks for the info @buddhafinger  - @kkresek-mentor closing this for now but feel free to re-open it if you're still having trouble with the VM\n. @SeAlgoAsoma As with any Beta software and different environment setups issues do happen and why this section exists. Kitematic has been working really well for me for a while and each update fixes some of the bugs found via issues encountered by other users.\nDid you search the list of issues for a possible similar problem and possible fixes? We have a wiki that also highlights some of the solutions that allowed other users to get their docker tool setup working as expected: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes\nIf you're willing to help us debug your issue, it would be appreciated. I would need to know the following:\n- Kitematic version: You can go to the menu and click on 'About' and screenshot it\n- What image were you trying to download?\n- Were you logged in to the DockerHub when doing it?\n- If you were logged in, did you validate your email address?\n. @vmnamburu The timeout happens within the VM; making the connection test within your browser only confirms that your main computer is connected, but it's possible that the VM lost its connection.\nAre you behind a proxy? If so, check out the wiki: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#add-proxy-settings-to-vm\nI would also suggest a complete restart - Virtualbox's network daemon can sometimes be finicky.\n. @miguelqvd The Early support for Linux is actually made to NOT create a VM and why the above error exists. \nYou should be installing the Docker daemon directly on your ubuntu workstation, which Kitematic will then connect to.\nThe above export commands are useless as the early Linux support doesn't look for a VM at all. \nYou can checkout the Ubuntu install how-to at the following url: https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/\n. @Yogiraj24 If you look at the image repository you will notice that no 'tags' actually exist for that image. I would suggest creating a tag in order to download it - The 'latest' tag is the default and why there is an attempt made at downloading it:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/yogasmahajan/yogasmahajan/tags/\n. @ndevireddy @Juchar Setting up a proxy in Kitematic has been detailed in the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#proxy-issues\nAdding the proxy to Kitematic is a good idea, but unfortunately it also needs to be added within the VM - Perhaps this could be part of the Docker Toolbox setup rather than Kitematic.\n. @ndevireddy Kitematic should allow you to login behind a proxy as it makes a regular https request to the Hub. \nWhat we've seen in the past, is that the certificate is modified by the proxy, faking an insecure connection. If you go to https://hub.docker.com/ do you see any ssl error? Can you take a screenshot of the SSL connection details?\n. Did you try the guide for to ensure that your VM had the proper proxy settings; since it seems that the issue happens when you are behind a proxy? \nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#proxy-issues\n. @fuzzball5000 Unfortunately as you see in the Wiki, it's not just in the Gui that this needs to happen but within the OS running inside the VM. Making changes to the VM within Kitematic isn't supported; vbox doesn't even give you a chance to 'inject' env vars into the VM OS, which makes this quite difficult\n. Looks like Virtualbox didn't play nice with your airport card drivers. Brew shouldn't be in there as Docker Toolbox does all of the work of installing the tools for you. \nCan you confirm your Virtualbox version? As of 10/02/2015 Virtualbox release 5.0.6 which has a kernel panic fix added: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=73652\n. Closing due to no further details provided\n. #closing in hopes of getting a more integrated solution in place where we can select the driver+vm from the GUI instead of a conf file\n. @michaeljs1990 still in the works - I'll try to work on something this week and get some QA behind it. I'll mention you on the PR if you'd like?\n. @tarapara That's a good work around and will work consistently - Thanks for sharing, I'll add it to the wiki :) - Can you close this issue as it's been resolved?\n. Docker CLI shouldn't be doing anything special with SSH keys - Are you sure you didn't have some recent terminal .bashrc changes?\n. There is nothing to fix, the code you pasted is what created / generated the key for you. Once the key has been generated then you should be fine. \nEither way this is not a Docker CLI issue #closing but feel free to comment as needed\n. @marcomarasco What image did you try to pull? Can you provide steps to repeat?\n. If you had previous versions of Kitematic/VM installed, is possible that errors could've been generated. Moving forward all VM are created with the name of 'default' - It looks like your last command worked and got your up and running. I'll close this for now but feel free to re-open it if the issue happens again. \n. @rwatts3 Can you try to run it with some debug info?\ndocker-machine -D regenerate-certs -f default\n. Closing as no description was provided\n. @ruandao Did you take a look at the wiki on setting up a proxy?\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#proxy-issues\nPerhaps it can help smooth some of the connection issues.\n. Closing due to no further details provided\n. LGTM\n. Please provide a description as to what is not downloading so that we can try to replicate.\n. :+1: \n. This is more of a toolbox issue than kitematic - Would you mind re-creating this issue within the toolbox hub?\nhttps://github.com/docker/toolbox/issues\n. :+1: \n. Closing this for now - If you still have issues, please provide more details so that we can find a solution.\n. Depending on the image that you're using, the volume directive may not have been declared, thus it doesn't show up in Kitematic. \nFor all images that have the VOLUME in their dockerfile, you will be able to map a folder. There's a pending PR #722,  that needs to be update, but would allow you to map volumes even when one wasn't declared in the Dockerfile.\n. Did you install it via the Docker Toolbox?\n. Did you uncheck VirtualBox install? Can you confirm that it was installed properly?\n. Can you check your Env vars and post them here?\nIt should also have the Docker toolbox path defined:\n\n. :+1: Good to hear this was resolved.\n. #closing in favor of #696 \n. LGTM\n. Still LGTM thanks for the quick fix\n. Still LGTM thanks for the quick fix\n. @sammcj It's not a question of detecting VMware or another VM-like provider, but rather the ability to provide open-source/free VM management software. \nThere was an attempt to add some config to Kitematic in order to support the different driver/providers, but it's a bit of hack: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/1108\nAllowing the user to select a VM that's been registered with docker-machine would be the way to go. I may create a PR for something like that. \n. Closing with future PR in mind\n. Currently this is setup in a hard-coded way, where the 'recommended' images have an img entry defined, that is then pulled from the web:\nhttps://kitematic.com/recommended.json\nIdeally this would be a feature of the repo that you're using, where an icon could be added. \n. If it's in Hub, Kitematic would be able to use it. \nYou can open up a ticket for it here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/hub-feedback\n. Closing this in favor of an issue opened with Hub :)\n. Thanks @michaelwilde I believe it's an up and coming feature. The issue just makes sure there is more leverage for it to happen sooner ;)\n. This is somewhat the expected behavior - The docker run command you've pointed out doesn't name the container or specify how it should run - See the hub documentation for the proper flags:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/\nInstead of the command line, use kitematic directly to get your containers created. There's an official 'hello-world-nginx' image that you can spin up to see the proper behavior. \n. Closing as this isn't really an issue but confusion on usage. Feel free to re-open if needed.\n. @ynagarjuna1995 Can you run the following to see if the default VM was created properly:\ndocker-machine ls\nYou can also see the list of VMs created by opening VirtualBox\n. Thank you for the PR - The 'empty' space is actually a result of the window size, where 3 image boxes cannot fit and thus wrap around. \nIf the window was slightly bigger, then it would allow for them to span across the entire window width. \nUnfortunately your fix wouldn't allow for more than 2 images to be displayed on 1 row, which could look very ugly on larger screens. Could you try to tweak it so that 2 images fit 100% but if more than 2 could fit, then you see more? (3, 4, etc)\n. Much better, but if there is only '1' container on a row, it is stretched to the entire width of the window, which looks unbalanced IMHO\n\n. @AndreyAntipov Can you walk me through the steps you took to create this error?\n. :+1: \n. @b1alpha Can you provide steps to reproduce?\n- Docker Toolbox version\n- Docker image used\n- Terminal command\n- VM setup\n  etc.\n. Closing due to no details provided\n. @ultimateboy We implemented a fix for this which should be out here soon - Be on the lookout for a newer Docker Toolbox version\n. @ultimateboy Thanks for the feedback - I'll check the code to see why more images aren't showing\n. Fixed with https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/1180\n. Did you use the Docker Toolbox to install everything? \n. :+1:  Can you close the issue since it is now resolved?\n. Tried to QA with Windows but currently getting some errors from virtualbox. Will wait for new toolbox to be pushed out\n. FYI, it looks like the branch needs to be updated prior to final push\n. @pmario it did due to machine management. The VM selection was fine, but for the most part, there was no mounting of folders and misc actions were broken. \n. I agree with that approach, unfortunately the current heavy vbox integration makes it difficult. \nWe've considered re-writing the app completely with the  plugin in mind, but there's a lot to do to make that happen. \nI'm open to suggestions if you see an easy way to get that working?\n. Looks like you ran out of disk space. How big is your hard drive?\n. Very likely yes - A stable/good connection is assumed and having intermittent connections will cause some issues.\nClosing this for now.\n. @vhcdev Are you behind a proxy?\n. Closing due to no details provided\n. It's possible that your VM lost connectivity - Could you retry?\n. Closing due to no details provided\n. Are you behind a proxy? There a few possible fixes described in the Wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#proxy-issues\n. @CloneXpert you may need to restart the VM via: docker-machine restart default\n. Depending on the image you've selected you may not see it - There's a change request in place to use the IP + port whenever a URL isn't available. \nCan you share the name of the image you used for QA purposes?\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM\n. Hi @a1exus It is something that's been discussed previously as seen in the wiki, under machine management:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Machine-Management\n. @Jdesk When I look at the hub repo:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/nodebb/docker/tags/\nThere are no 'latest' tags defined. Where did it show up as a valid tag?\n. @jardakiss Since this seems to be a 1 time operation that can be done on the VM directly, there isn't much use for Kitematic to have this implemented. \nhttp://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/daemon/\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this. To confirm:\nbash\n$ docker-machine ls                                                                                                  \nNAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER         STATE     URL   SWARM\ndefault   -        virtualbox     Stopped\nStarted Kitematic 0.9.3 app, which showed the 'Starting Docker VM' - Once up confirmed the VM was up and running:\nbash\n$ docker-machine ls\nNAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER         STATE     URL   SWARM\ndefault   -        virtualbox     Stopped\nAlso immediately saw my containers on the left hand-side. \nWent under settings to uncheck the 'Shutdown Linux VM on closing Kitematic' - Quit kitematic, verified the VM was still up and running.\nLaunched Kitematic and saw once again the container list populated.\n. The following is actually 1 command:\ndocker-machine ssh default docker ps\nThe idea is to time the time it takes for docker ps to respond - Can you list the images you're using so that I can set it up exactly as you have it?\n. Interesting, the previous command works full on my Mac no problem, but perhaps it's running it as 2 commands for you? No matter what we spin up the VM and then actually get the data. \nOut of curiosity, what do you get with:\ndocker-machine ssh default docker info\n. Interesting....\nOne way to maybe pin-point this, is to keep the VirtualBox.app window open and see from the preview where the machine really is compared to maybe what's reported in the terminal.\nI have no clue why would you have such delays, as it's not something I've been able to replicate.\n. Sounds like it's the source of your problem. Even though the VM is 'up/started' it doesn't look like network is setup till afterwards, preventing Kitematic from displaying the containers.\nIf your VM can be discarded, it'd be interesting to see if removing it and re-creating it solves this.\ndocker-machine stop default\ndocker-machine rm default\nThen open the VirtualBox app and under 'VirtualBox > Preference' menu, select 'Network' then 'Host-Only Networks'. \n\nDelete all Host-Only network interfaces that have been created, then re-launch Kitematic to have it setup the new default VM and associated network interface.\n. From the above it seems that the Virtualbox layer is becoming the bottleneck. I usually disable the VM shutdown as well and rarely see the same lag. \nI'll keep this open to come back to. \n. Would something like this be good enough?\n\n. Do you have the actual error?\n. Are you behind a proxy? there are a couple of possible fixes within the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. Can you share your docker-compose file?\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. @bradjcox Looks like this is working correctly when you're using the docker commands. \nIt seems that you're having issues when using the build-xframes-docker - Perhaps you should ask the maintainer of the script to check/verify that it works correctly on your setup.\n. @Alexandreh I would make sure that you have a clean install, then check that your env variables get set properly. What does docker-machine env default return?\n. once you've copied and pasted the  eval ... then you should be able to do docker ps\n. @bcferrycoder what's the output of: docker-machine env default ?\n. can you ping the host? ping 192.168.99.100\nand provide the output of: docker-machine ssh default docker ps\n. One more try:\n$ eval \"$(docker-machine env -u)\"\n$ eval \"$(docker-machine env default)\"\n$ docker ps\n. I've never seen such issues tbh - Everything works. \ndocker-machine does work, since you're getting the info above without issues\nIt's possible that you have some odd terminal setting that is preventing the connection. If you open a 'clean' terminal, what is your env like?\n. that is very strange. \nfor the first command, you can also do: docker $(docker-machine config default) ps\nThe one thing that is odd, is your cert path - it's actually not complete. eg mine is:\nenv | grep -i docker\nDOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\nDOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376\nDOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/frenchben/.docker/machine/machines/default\nDOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=default\nWhat is the version reported by docker-machine version\nAlso:\nwhich docker-machine\nwhich docker\n. @bcferrycoder Glad you found out the root cause - Figured something like that was going on. \nI'll take a :beer: for the on-going effort :D \n. @lfilho Please keep the issue isolated to 1 place - You've already commented on a closed issue and doing the same here is not helping anyone\n. @ShashankaNataraj Did you try the above debugging steps?\n. @realisation then the VM didn't get created\n. @realisation I would start Kitematic as it will create the VM for you.\n. @danpe did you run the above command? \neval \"$(docker-machine env default)\"\n. @prashathsenthil issue the following in a terminal: docker-machine env default\n. @loonydevil you mean that you do not have docker-machine? the original boot2docker came with an app click, from which you issues all of your commands. Essentially you were in the VM to start with.\n. @ripper2hl What version of toolbox are you using? the 'supr3hardenedwinrespawn' error was seen a lot in Vbox 4.3 - The Docker Toolbox now uses 5.0\n. It's definitely an issue with Virtualbox. Can you try to reinstall C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\drivers\\vboxdrv\\VBoxDrv.inf \n. Good to hear! Closing this.\n. @ClemMakesApps Thanks for digging this up - I'll close the issue, as it was fixed by #1201 as you mentioned. \nThanks!\n. I'm not sure how kitematic has any issue then - We run the exact same command. :8ball: \n. :+1: \n. I've had Kitematic open over-night and still working the next day. Can you share the image used with logs running and perhaps any interaction with the container using the terminal?\n. There's a new change to the log functionality that was recently made which fixes this issue. Thanks for the input. \nAn update will be rolled out with the latest patches.\n. A few comments but otherwise looks awesome! \n. LGTM\n. :+1: All looks good\n. :) Thanks @mikaoelitiana for the PR :clap: - This issue will actually be part of a new Kitematic doc section, where we detail how to go about contributing to this project. \nIt's interesting to see that you did something similar to show it, but since this is part of an exercise, I will unfortunately not be able to merge your PR. \nThanks again and please feel free to work on any other issue! \n. :+1: :+1:  Please do. Glad to see you contributing to the project. Feel free to look through the different issues. If you see something you'd like to work on, just add a comment to it per the Contributing Guidelines:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/opensource/workflow/find-an-issue/ (but for the kitematic/kitematic repo ;)\n. :+1: thanks for creating this PR - I'll check it out tomorrow, but at first glance it seems that you found a good way to check for shared folders. \nCan you confirm that this also compiles properly on Windows?\n. Doing some QA on the code you currently have I'm having a couple of issues while using the hello-world-nginx\n- After adding a Volume, trying to remove it, I get the following JS error:\n  ContainerSettingsVolumes.react.js:132 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of null\nAlso mounting a volume on my Desktop (within the user dir), removing it and closing kitematic and opening it again, I get the following within your repo:\n\nI confirmed this doesn't happen on Master.\n. Wont' be able to look at it till monday - meanwhile, can you squash your commits into logical commits, instead of the multiple \"fix this\" \"removed that\"?\n. I mounted a folder from the tmp dir in VirtualBox and made it 'automount' + 'permanent'\n\nI then opened Kitematic based on your PR, created a container based on the kitematic/hello-world-nginx and tried to mount a folder outside of the mounted volume and got the proper error :+1: \nWhen I tried to mount the volume in tmp, everything went well and it reported the volume as mounted. \nThe problem was that the 'index.html' file that normally gets created/copied into the volume mounted, didn't get copied. \nAre you able to replicate this issue? If so, do you know why this is happening?\n. Weird on my machine, going to D:\\Temporal there was no file created - What permissions did you give the folder when you mounted it via VirtualBox?\n. My question was how you add the folder to VirtualBox?\n. @kotowick feel free to also do some QA on this PR and see if it works for you. The more test cases, the better\n@alexandrev Can you also update this branch and I'll try it again?\n. I'm currently running into some networking issues which prevent this PR from being properly QA'd - I'll try to get those fixed to give this a proper test. \nThank you for your patience.\n.

See:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#/shared-drives\n. @jhgorse The 'add a folder' screenshot is from Virtualbox - Kitematic will not show any folder if the image that you're using doesn't have a volume directive. \nTry something like the Kitematic nginx hello world and you'll see the folder option. \nAdding a folder when one isn't declared in the image, has yet to be implemented with the latest changes.

Can you try to check the following:\ndocker-machine ls\ndocker-machine env default\nping 192.168.99.102\nand report the output here? \n. I do like it, although the UX is a bit weird.\nWhen I fill-out the ports and I hit 'Save', without clicking '+', I expected the port to be added. It was instead discarded.\nWhen playing with ports, it's not possible to remove the EXPOSED ports from the list - Perhaps this should be checked prior to adding the 'X' (delete) option? Essentially only allowing a user to delete the ports they manually added\nSomething else I noticed is that when adding an extra port and stopping the container, the originally exposed port-mapping is 'stuck' and will never change, when it should be released.\nYou can easily replicate by adding a new port to the 'kitematic/hello-world-nginx' and stopping it. Then do a docker inspect on it. \nCompare that to a similar port assignment with the current kitematic version\n. @alexandrev I can reproduce the issue consistently. Here's how:\n- Create a new container based on the hello-world-nginx\n- Go to the settings -> Ports tab.\n  \n- Enter a new port number, say 888\n  \n- Don't hit save, but click on the '+' to add the port to the list.\n  \n- Hit save and notice that the port you added via the '+' will disappear until you go back to a different tab and come back to the port tab\n  \n. Similarly, if you follow the above steps, but don't click the '+' and just hit save, the port will not be saved?\nYou can check this by clicking 'Save' (the list gets updated as-if it worked), go to the 'General' tab, then come back to the 'Ports' tab and notice that the port you added (without clicking '+' but by clicking 'Save') is no longer part of the list.\n. no problem.

I'm not sure if I follow - Can you take a screenshot of the issue, as I'm not seeing any odd behavior while on Windows 10\n. Unfortunately that is the expected behavior, as the Fedora image doesn't seem to provide the command needed for the container to start. \nSee: https://hub.docker.com/_/fedora/\nYou could run it in the console and then see it within kitematic:\ndocker -it $(docker-machine config default) run fedora /bin/bash\n. Can you provide the output of the following command:\ndocker $(docker-machine config default) ps -a\n. Good to hear - Closing the issue\n. @ToniIltanen If you'd like to own the implementation, please do so :). To QA this issue I did the following from the command line:\ndocker $(docker-machine config default) run kitematic/hello-world-nginx\nImmediately saw the container show up in kitematic.\nThen ran the same command but setup as a daemon:\ndocker $(docker-machine config default) run -itd kitematic/hello-world-nginx\nand also saw it in Kitematic.\nBased on your output, I ran the following:\ndocker $(docker-machine config default) run jupyter/datascience-notebook\nWhile the container was downloading I didn't see anything in kitematic, which is expected.\nOnce the container was actually up and running it showed up as expected within the container list.\n. it's very possible - I'll close this for now, but feel free to re-open.\n. Do you have a link to the software?\n. unfortunately you may need to get more information from your admin on getting the VM connected/allowed to the internet, as it's outside the scope of kitematic.\n. Can you share the command you're running via the CLI?\n. That is weird - I don't think we do anything different, but it seems that the CMD is ran, yet the java process is never started. \nI'll see if I can pin-point it. Thanks for the issue.\n. Yup I think you've nailed it. The extra bash prevents it from running the jenkins, as the script has the followin:\n```\nAs argument is not jenkins, assume user want to run his own process, for sample a bash shell to explore this image\nexec \"$@\"\n```\nI'll checkout your PR, but on first glance it seems like the proper fix. Thanks :+1: \n. @ctran we actually pushed a similar fix within the latest cut of Kitematic. \nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/blob/master/src/utils/DockerUtil.js#L129\nCheckout the latest Docker Toolbox to get the latest version.\n. I believe this happens when a container died after an update. If you get a container error, you will not be able to remove it, as it was not actually created. \nCan you provide the steps taken to reproduce this issue?\n. I was able to reproduce this also on my end (first time I've seen it). Seems that Nginx has some light latency when being removed to be recreated, causing the port to be tied up. \nI'll look into it. Thanks for the test.\nps: could you share your default.conf as well?\n. Please update to the latest tools, although this is a known issue when a container dies. \n. Same as: \nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1258\nClosing in favor of earlier issues\n. After reviewing this with @jeffdm it feels natural to add this step after the download.\nThe flow would be:\nSearch for image - > Click create container to initiate the download -> Download prompts the user with defaults from the image defaults -> Create container based on said defaults\n. Just need to come up with the proper user flow. I didn't see a ton of feedback here, so it's perhaps not needed?\n. @GasCreature Can you provide some background information on perhaps previous docker installations?\nCan you share the version of your tools?\ndocker-machine --version\ndocker version\n. I don't think it's just the quick start, a lot of the docker/machine settings rely on the user's home directory and precisely the information we need to understand what's going on. \nCould you share exactly all of the changes you made and how they were applied (gist of .rc .profile would help)\nThanks\n. @GasCreature It seems that you have a pretty custom setup - We currently only support vanilla setups which is why Toolbox may not be working well for you.\nI would advise against installing virtualbox separately from Toolbox and letting it do all of the setup for you.\n. @GasCreature you're right that the assumption is difficult, but we package the different tools for the versions that are known to work well. \nFor example using vbox 4.3 may be ok, but more than likely will cause more issues than the stable release of 5.0.10 included with Toolbox.\nRegarding the home folder it's simply due to the default Vbox setup which maps your local folder to the VM. \n.

See:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/v1.7/articles/networking/#dns\n. @klousiaj Although it could be, dns setup could be done after the fact too, as it doesn't affect the container as much as some of the features needed during the initial creation\n. @Malouke Feel free to re-create the default VM to suit your needs. We only provide the VM with some ok resources, but you can go nuts and give all you've got if desired.\n. Sounds like a simple restart of kitematic should do it - I would also recommend upgrading to the latest Docker Toolbox if you haven't already done so.\n. There have been a couple of network incidents, which you can check here:\nhttp://status.docker.com/\nClosing this for now, but feel free to re-open if the issue persist past the network incident\n. Is there a specific UI area that would need larger font? Everything seems pretty big to me. \n. The description font is going to be tough, as a lot of the layout depends on the size of those boxes. Upping the description font size may throw off some of the boxes. You can always click the 3 ooo and click the 'View on Docker Hub' link.\nGetting the log fonts 'larger' shouldn't be too hard.\n. @ceagan I agree - there were some comments added to the PR but haven't seen changes since then.\n. @adrido The PR is still open with some changes needed. If you have time to help make it better, please contribute :). @ArianeLu Agreed, although that's also a full revamp of a lot of underlying functionality as well, which isn't a small change. . I believe the VM is capped at 20gb - You'll need to re-create it with a larger disk size if you're using that much space. \nTake a look at: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/825\n. @jeffdm can you PTAL?\n. @soulteary There was some early work done on VM selection and the ability to support the different VM. \ndocker-machine no longer ships with all of the drivers, which means that a user would need to install them separately making this a lot more cumbersome. \nThanks for the code snippet which help clarify some of the changes needed. \n. Sorry - looks like they reverted back to 1 binary. up to 0.5.2 all drivers were separate and had to be downloaded with machine. \nIf you want to create a proper PR it would need to support both fusion + vbox - fusion isn't free, which stops most users that are using this open source project.\n. Understood - it's a good step in allowing different VM setup, but there is a lot more VM management behind it.\n. When I go to: https://docs.docker.com/mac I see the proper Mac page. Why the need to change the docs?\nAdditionally it seems that some test fail. For this PR to be considered all tests must pass.\n. @jeffdm PTAL\n. @elmar-hinz can you detail how it's dangerous and destroyed your database?\n. It works well for me - \n\nAny chance we could update the + and - to something a bit more standard?\nAdding them to the 'View' menu dropdown would make more sense and bind the - and + keys to do just that. \nView > Log Zoom In\n\nView > Log Zoom Out\n\nSimilar to the Zoom In / Zoom Out in your browser.\n. Yes, I would remove the buttons to keep the interface clean. \nYou're correct, it may need to become a separate utility perhaps in Util.js to keep the logic of increase/decrease log font size. \nIf we pass it as a prop to logWidget in the ContainerHome file, then it should refresh properly. \n. @aquascaper Since the log font functionality is going to change a lot from this PR, I'm closing it in favor of a future PR with the above implementation. \n. No worries - Since this isn't a critical fix and more of a feature, you can take as long as you need :D\n. @dmitriz I completely agree that this is something that needs to be changed - If you don't mind, create a separate issue with a full feature proposal. There's a lot of work to do and could use the help if this is something you could implement. \nThanks!\n. @dmitriz I completely agree that this is something that needs to be changed - If you don't mind, create a separate issue with a full feature proposal.

The fact that you can manually start it, wait for it to come all the way up then start kitematic shows that it's a network issue.\nI should've mentioned that I rarely turn off the VM and keep it running. This means that when Kitematic starts, it's already up and running and ready to show my containers. \nI'll look to see if we could integrate some sort of 're-sync' button, which would allow you to re-sync the container list and prevent this from happening after the initial load. Does this sound like a step in the right direction? (short of fixing Vbox of course)\n. I think you're spot on - It seems to be a race condition when we try to communicate with the VM.

It's doable but not high on the priority list - If you'd like open a new Issue with a title that starts with Feature proposal: and I'll add the proper labels to it, so that we get around to implementing it in the future\n. Kitematic isn't really the issue, but rather the VM communicating with docker.io - You can read more about proxy settings in our wiki:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. Kitematic relies on Docker itself for all API requests. As long as there is support in place, Kitematic can then adapt.\n. Kitematic will use the VirtualBox VM of default - As long as you setup the vm as such, the mounted folder can use a different protocol and still work in Kitematic. \n. There's a pending PR for it that needs some attention - Subscribe to it if you'd like to be updated\n. @sebadiaz This has been brought up on multiple occasions and is a bit more tricky than what you have implemented here. \nFor the background, see: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/210 \nThanks for the first PR!\n. I like the code, but unfortunately don't see a many use cases in customizing the recommended images. \nThe recommended images are official repos and what 99% of the users look for. \n. It would be good to have some of the users with the no container listed QA this. I can't tell if it helps or not.\nPing @klousiaj @dbartow \n. @klousiaj thanks for the qa - @dbartow I'll try to make an exe/dmg for you to test this and see if it solves your issue.\nOnce you're both happy with it, then we'll merge it. :)\nThanks @alexandrev for the on-going help!!\n. @alexandrev I pulled it into a local branch with other fixes in place. I have to do all cross-platform checks manually and replicate previous issues/actions,\nAs mentioned in the other posts, it's a time consuming task :[\n. @alexandrev I took the above changes as part of some cleanup of the linux distro - It's basically in https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1442 - If you don't mind we'll use that branch over this one, as it contains a lot of small fixes that should make some of the linux support easier. \nIs it ok for me to close this PR in favor of the above?\n. :+1: Thank you for being understanding :) - Trying to push things forward!\n. That's a know issue, where the container list doesn't refresh properly in Kitematic when an error happens. Closing in favor of previous issue.\nThanks\n. From the response given, it seems you are behind a proxy - I would follow the Wiki on setting up your VM to work with the Proxy:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. It sounds like the VM didn't get created properly - Can you open VirtualBox, delete the VM and try to re-open Kitematic?\n. Closing as this seems to be resolved?\n. @davidshen84 The VM shutdown can take a few mins to execute. It's possible that you're checking as it's shutting down?\n. I see what you mean - we would need something like before:close - Maybe open an issue in the electron repo and see what they have to say?\n. :+1: \n. Shutting down the vm does take a few seconds... Can you consistently reproduce this? Did you change any of the pref for VM shutdown?. Are you behind a proxy?

There's a PR in progress for this - Be on the lookout for future release changelog\n. It looks like your VM may need to be restarted. \nCan you close down Kitematic and issue the following: docker-machine restart default\n. By default all ports are exported. if they aren't exported then they wouldn't have a MAC IP PORT assigned. \nAdding 'none' as a port type would be adding a possible entry for bugs/issues if a user failed to select either. \nThis behavior mimics how most router admin behave as well:\n\n. Although not obvious perhaps, the information isn't lost. If you mouse-over the image name, a pop-up will be displayed with the proper namespace.\n\n. It could be some network interference. \nIf you want to checkout the proxy info:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. It's possible that VirtualBox's network has failed - A simple restart of Kitematic and the VM should do it:\ndocker-machine restart default\n. I think this as a very particular use case - The machine has a default as explained above, which means that the flag would need to be passed with every docker-machine command. \nIf anything you could symlink the .docker dir to be within your data partition and make this all work the same?\n. It's actually the first time I've heard of someone needing/wanting to move where the VM are stored. \nThanks for your understanding.\n. Closing for now. We can revisit it if there is a demand for it. :8ball: \n. LGTM\n. Are you behind a proxy?

Hi @RiderSx Please see the wiki for possible fixes:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#windows-10\n. I'm not saying that you didn't try to enable it - The wiki showed that doing it multiple times actually made it work for some. \nUnfortunately Virtualbox isn't as perfect as one would hope and the error posted is related to the network adapters it tries to create.\nIf you can't get it to work, you may need to simply remove all adapters and re-install it.\n. I've tried to re-create it in my Windows VM without any luck - it makes it difficult to identify the issue.\nDo you have any antivirus/firewall installed?\n. @Rikbruggink Thanks for the feedback and info - @RiderSx can you check if this helps?\n. @RiderSx Glad to hear this has been resolved by the latest patches!\n. This isn't broken- Looking at the library, there is no tag 'latest': https://hub.docker.com/r/jgajek/cuckoo-docker/tags/\nSelect an appropriate tag and everything will work as expected.\n. Sounds like there are some leftover issues in your bashrc/zshrc/terminal pref. \nI would clear those first. \n. What image did you use to create this container? Did you read the Docs associated with that image?\n. Did you follow the Kitematic development guide?\nhttps://docs.docker.com/opensource/kitematic/set_up_dev/\n. It's close, but the docs do specify the NPM version, as it's what we've been using. \nIf you're getting a 'white' screen after npm start it's more than likely an issue with your code/env\n. Seems like an issue with your VM - I would simply issue a restart of it via:\ndocker-machine restart default\n. It's possible that your VM has lost its connection.

This was also in the wiki: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#cannot-download-imageconnect\nThanks for confirming that it works\n. The issue is that the VM itself doesn't mount the volume/drive - Therefore you end up with a 1/2 mounted volume and no way to really get the data. \nIf you would like, subscribe to the PR, which has some of this info:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1202\n. Thanks @nathanleclaire for chiming in :+1: \n. The login should be saved for your sessions and every other session after that - Are you doing something odd when you quit the app?\nWhat's your homedir structure like?\n. How many containers do you have? Any steps to reproduce this issue?\n. There are some issues with Virtualbox's networking that hopefully are saved in the latest release. \nCan either of you try the latest Toolbox?\n. The fact that a restart works seems to show that the networking is getting in the way - \n. @bryanjcampbell @andrew-w-ross unfortunately the issue is related to Virtualbox not Kitematic - Hence the ticket being closed. \nWe usually keep up with the vbox changes and try to update Kitematic as often as possible to get the vbox updates pushed to the users.\n. Please see: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/728\n. I'm not seeing this behavior at all and can't replicate - What version of kitematic/virtualbox (toolbox) are you using?\n. @EugeneKrapivin :+1: \n. I'm running Windows 10 and did the following without any issues:\n1. Open Docker Quickstart Terminal\n2. Ran cd My\\ Documents then vi desktop.ini to confirm I could view/edit the file\n3. Ran echo $TERM and confirmed cygwin\n4. Started a new busybox container with sh: docker run -itd busbybox sh\n5. Exec'd into the container: docker exec -it container-id sh\n6. Used vi etc/groups saw all groups no problem\n7. Ran echo $TERM and got xterm\nWhatever you're doing in your 'container' seems to be causing an issue. If the above scenario works properly, then it's pointing to issues with how you connect or whatever is in your my-container.\n. Less works perfectly fine for me in busybox - I really think you have something going on in your terminal that's causing the issues/crashing. \nDoing:\n$ docker run -it busybox\n/ # less /etc/passwd\nActually shows the content of the file for me and I can escape out q without any issues at all.\nSame thing with the ubuntu image. which actually uses regular vi not vim.\n$ docker run -it ubuntu bash\nroot@1dc5928237d5:/# less /etc/passwd\nroot@1dc5928237d5:/# vi /etc/passwd\nI could then navigate with j (down) k (up) l (right) h (left)\nSeems to be a problem with your system - Try on a fresh machine and report back if it still happens\n. @alankent no worries, it's sometimes difficult to tell if the software is at fault or something on the machine is causing it. Thanks for the feedback.\n. Looks like you're behind a Proxy?\nTry to setup the Proxy env by following the guide:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. There's a Feature request for exactly that here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1260\n. Unfortunately an issue of CN networks\n. If docker-machine can't communicate with the VM, then Kitematic wont be able to either - The issue you're seeing is simply due to the new IP and the fact that the certs were made for the previous IP.\nYou should be able to regen the certs and fix all this:\ndocker-machine regenerate-certs default\n. @bcooney it sounds like some Vbox network issues - If the VM is brand new (aka it can be blown away) then I would do just that via docker-machine rm default and re-create one by opening Kitematic\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. No details provided - closing\n. I'll change the if/else on the display message - good call\n. @rolfedh  Although we should be able to handle emails, the input does say username :P, similar to the hub login page: \nhttps://hub.docker.com/login/\nAs Jeff mention we will update the error message to be even more clear.\n. @arturoliveira Selecting the proper (existing) tag for the image should allow you to make this work.\n. dup of #1445 \n. Sorry to bring this back up after so many exchanges - If I click on the + without any ports, I get a warning:\nWarning: bind(): You are binding a component method to the component. React does this for you automatically\nAlso can't seem to get new ports added to stick - is it still working for you?\n. @alexandrev After some QA I found one small issue.\nIf you have a port mapped and try to add the same port mapped to a different endpoint, the refresh fails and only 1 port gets mapped. \nFor example:\n| Container | Mac/Win |\n| --- | --- |\n| 80 | 8080 |\n| 80 | 8081 |\n. Although I'm a big fan of Chocolatey, we use the Docker Toolbox to do the install on Windows and set the above variables. \nSimilarly on the Mac, we use the Docker Toolbox to do the install instead of pushing for a brew solution. \nWith that said, I do like the improvements to the code in order to locate the proper binary - I'll QA the changes and see if there is a 'breaking' condition. \nAs another side note, while you're in there, can you also update the call to the existSync? See:\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_existssync_path\n. @jeffdm PTAL\n. @StefanScherer I'm gona go ahead and merge this as it seems to be working well  - Sorry for the delay. Sounds like you're having some networking issues. Please see our wiki for common solutions:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#cannot-download-imageconnect\n. As seen/explained in the PR https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1202#issuecomment-180992712 There's a bit of a manual process to get this working and the main blocker is how Vbox handles the mounts.\nClosing in favor of discussion within the PR\n. There are multiple meanjs images, providing the actual link to the image could help - The above seems like an image error, not an issue with Kitematic\n. Last commit is from last year (8/2015) - I'd ping the maintainer to see if there are updates pending\n. Sounds like your VBox network isn't connecting properly - A restart of it should do the trick:\ndocker-machine restart default\n. The image above is quite large and your network needs to be consistent for it to download properly - I would restart the VM to reset the networking and try to download it from a stable connection.\ndocker-machine restart default\n. Thanks for the info - Would  you be able to write-up how you see it working?\nThis would help anyone willing to work on this feature.\n. @alexandrev I don't think this is important, as this is the first use case - I would like the OP to take a stab at it, if he thinks this is something important to him.\nI'm sure it's a nice feature, but there's a bit more to it due to the info for that container no longer being saved in the container data but rather in somewhere in kitematic.\n. @ericmann As explained above, I'm waiting for someone to step up and provide details on how this feature will be implemented.\nCurrently we're focused on bug fixes rather features like this. Any help is appreciated however. \n. @bostonaholic Since you're actually moving on the PR, I'm re-opening. Thanks for carrying this. \n. Please do not open multiple issues for the same problem - Per our discussion on the other thread, this looks like a problem with the actual image. https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1452\nIf all official images work out of the box, then please open an issue in the repo for the image above. \n. welcome @3ricGit \n. It's possible that your VM lost connectivity - I would issue the following and check again:\ndocker-machine restart default\n. That would be great - Thanks!\n.

Are you running some CLI/Compose commands?\n. Do you have any antivirus/firewall running?

Closing until steps to reproduce can be provided.\n. @S3curityPlu5 Are you trying to use Linux containers or Windows containers?. not really sure what the issue is, as there is no details of errors/issues. Closing until further details are provided\n. @alankent The VM is what's keeping the port busy (the vm runs boot2docker). Short of changing the port-mapping as you've done, there isn't much more to do. \nIf you use the rsync enough, you could also alias the command or create a small shell script to do just that.\n. Are you behind a proxy? Do you have any antivirus running?\nI would follow the steps found in the wiki and see if that helps:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes\n. :+1: Glad you figured out the issue\n. It's unfortunately a Vbox issue, where the networking bit isn't always brought back up properly. Shutting down kitematic+VM and restarting them does the job.\n. I would restart the VM to make sure the connection is solid: docker-machine restart default\n. @tomasmelin sounds like an issue with the image - When I followed the details found on the hub page, and ran the command specified docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 sonarqube:5.1 everything worked for me. \n. @tomasmelin you need to mount/map the entire path:\n-v $PWD:/opt/sonarqube \n. should just be your local path, you can check it by doing:\necho $PWD\n.

I'd like to cleanup some of our pending PRs \ud83c\udfaf \n. no problem - If it helps, you can do: git rebase -i origin/master\nThat should allow you to see all of your commits and decide which ones are squashed.\n. Ping @aquascaper Did you get a chance to add the 'reset' feature?\n. @aquascaper no rush on my end - Didn't want to be the blocker for the PR. Take your time, I really appreciate the PR :)\n. @superkarn I was waiting for @SupaJoon to update it. . I would restart the VM docker-machine restart default\n. Hi @superherointj feel free to submit one - Theme support is currently not in our immediate roadmap. \n. @wonea if you have an easy way to get this added, I'm all for it!. @mrspeaker It may be needed. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. From your logs it looks like some of the certs may have failed. I would do the following:\nRestart your VM:\ndocker-machine restart default\nRegenerate your certs:\ndocker-machine regenerate-certs default\n. Hey Fritz,\nWe have a section in the wiki that talks about Proxy:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\nHopefully some of those could help. Let me know!\n. Once you select a container the right panel shows a couple of status along with the play/stop button.\nAdditionally the icon type is different when the container is running and when it's not. \n. Should this PR be closed in favor of #1541 ?\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1541\n. Haven't had any issues on my side - Closing for now, but feel free to report back if the problem persists\n. The button wouldn't work in your use-case, since you've already shutdown Kitematic to do something else and would need to start it back up to shutdown the VM.\nInstead you can do: docker-machine stop default\n. It could be that the docker images you speak off do not emulate tty as expected - Could you list the images?\nThis has happened before to other user and it turned out to be a windows config issue (specific settings in PowerShell getting in the way)\n. the default shell selected is /bin/sh - if you switch to something like /bin/bash in the container, the arrows should work . Are you behind a proxy? If so, please follow some of the steps found in the Wiki:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. If you look at the last line, it says what the error is:\nVirtualBox is configured with multiple host-only adapters with the same IP\nIf you only have 1 VM, then you can delete all of the host-only adapters and docker-machine will re-create them for you. \nOtherwise follow the instructions here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#kitematic-vm-stuck-at-99-or-cannot-pull-images\n. What version of iTerm are you using?\nI have iTerm 2.1.4 installed, when I click on Docker CLI a new tab opens in my existing iTerm window - If no iTerm window is open, a new one is opened.\n. @petems there's a PR against it, but since it's mainly due to beta/nightly, it hasn't been merged:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/855\nWe don't want to keep making changes to a beta/nightly build as it may add more code changes than wanted. Once this goes to stable, we'll be able to merge if it's still an issue.\nThanks @gleblanc1783 for confirming that with stable releases it works as expected. \n. This is the expected behavior - If you look at the actual Hub repo for that user, the latest tag does not exist:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/marklee77/docker-xplico/tags/\n. Please provide:\n- Kitematic version\n- Docker version: docker version\n- Image selected\n- Changes to the normal container creation\n. Good to hear it's working :+1: \n. I'm guessing you didn't select the proper tag - Please check the user's repo and use the appropriate tag:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/datafellas/oreilly-pipeline/tags/\n. Thanks for the follow up - This has been documented in the wiki, as it's unfortunately one of the common issue with VBox\n. It looks like your vbox network died - Please close Kitematic and restart your VM: docker-machine restart default\n. Are you doing this within a work environment? (aka behind VPN)\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\nThe reason it was closed so quickly is that this is a VERY common issue when moving from a house network to say a coffee shop network and VBox can't adapt. Restarting the VM fixes the issue in 99.999% of the cases.\n. Can you run these commands:\n$ docker-machine ls\n$ docker-machine env default\nIf at any point you get the cert issue, then simply regenerate them:\ndocker-machine regenerate-certs default\n. Can you run the following?\ndocker-machine ssh default docker ps \nThis should execute the ps from within the VM.\nCan you share also:\nenv | grep -i \"docker\"\n. Did the ps command work?\n. Ok - it's encouraging to see that the daemon is up and running properly and it's only a network issue. \nDid you try to clean up your network adapters as a possible solution seen in this comment?\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1221#issuecomment-164476650\n. When Vbox sets up the VM it creates a bunch of host-specific networks. You can see them by opening the Virtualbox.app and going to Preferences then Network\nIdeally there should only be 1 Host-only network adapter created, but Vbox can sometimes get confused and create a LOT of them - It's safe to delete them all and re-create the VM so that it creates the only 1 it needs:\n\n. @imaginethepoet I can't remember if you went through it, but I would check the host-only settings:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#kitematic-vm-stuck-at-99-or-cannot-pull-images\nIssues as you describe are usually network related where VBox isn't really doing its job (hence the issue with Kitematic connecting)\n. Let me know - seems that your system has something peculiar about it that's preventing it from working properly.\nAnother possible test would be to Uninstall everything and create a new OSX user. Login as that user and try the Docker Toolbox again.\nIf everything is working as expected than you've narrowed it down to your user config\n. We've discussed this functionality as well, but as you mentioned a lot of the 'localhost' functionality would need to be hidden/updated to handle the remote hosts. \nI'm open to suggestions on how this would be done. \n. That's the expected behavior - If you look at the repo for that specific image, no tag have been defined, let alone the 'latest' one.\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/dashdb/preview/tags/\n. I was able to pull the image without any issue:\n\nI would close Kitematic and restart the VM before trying again: docker-machine restart default\n. If you're behind a proxy, please see:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\nOtherwise I would recommend restarting the VM: docker-machine restart default\n. What do you consider 'improper shutdown'  Can you provide steps to replicate?\n. I believe for most cases a simple restart of Kitematic + VM does the trick. \nBeing able to recover from corruption would be on the VM side of things, IMHO\n. There were some connection latency on the repos around that time - I would recommend closing down kitematic and then restarting the vm: docker-machine restart default\n. @hildjj thank you for the changes, there was a recent PR that was merged to prevent breaking changes found in the 2.9+ release. \nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/855\nCan you see if the 2.9 change fixes it for you in iTerm3?\n. We would like to see the open of a docker-compose file first, but importing a tar file would be pretty cool too. \nFeel free to create a PR for it ;)\n. I would restart the VM and see if the error persists: docker-machine restart default\nClosing this for now, but feel free to re-open it if you still experience errors\n. I think that's the expected behavior as most of the release tools used were implemented with a Mac in mind. \nFeel free to update it so that Windows can build its own release. We usually do both Mac+Windows in 1 run, so it made sense to build the Windows release using Mac tools, as it's usually easier than the opposite. \n. :+1: \n. I have a container that's just a redis DB that was shutdown for a while and thus didn't have any logs - This caused the following error: \nContainerHomeLogs.react.js:55 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined \nThe above error prevented me from doing anything but close the app. \nCould you see why this is happening?\n. Closing in favor of #1728\n. Did you try to restart the VM? docker-machine restart default\n. I would try to restart the VM to get the network layer reset: docker-machine restart default\n. Hi @pmario there's an internal discussion on roadmap, which hasn't been reflected here until we're sure of the approach. \nAs of right now the goal is to fix bugs and release small features that don't break other things (hence some delay on the PR).\nMachine management is still pretty high on the list, but could also increase the in-flow of issues (see number of issues related to vbox)\nIf you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to add a feature proposal. One of the big feature to be added is support for docker-compose file. \n. That's exactly right- Some code was pulled out as it was split towards the toolbox. \nSince vbox is still currently a requirement that code wasn't touched and only the core pieces are used to check vbox setup and check if a vm exists. \nThere's a lot of cleanup that can be done, time is unfortunately the only thing missing. :(\n. @ggovindan Please see our possible solutions in the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. This looks like a private repository which I unfortunately can't check. I would recommend a quick reboot of your VM first and see if that solves the issue:\ndocker-machine restart default\n. LGTM @jeffdm PTAL\n. The latest tag does exist for that image, it's surprising that you got a 404 - More than likely your network connection isn't solid and the source of the download issue. \nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/bigdatauniversity/spark/tags/\nThe image is 2GB, please make sure that you have a good connection prior to downloading it.\n. it's possible that the VM lost its connectivity - I would shutdown Kitematic and restart the vm: docker-machine restart default\n. Nothing like this exists. It would be nice to see the app re-formatted to allow more flexibility and easier development. \nI'd be happy to help QA the app and provide help where I can. \n. Thanks for the heads-up, the website is more or less retired and thus is a non-issue.\n. That's somewhat expected as the VM state isn't cleanly shutdown - I would issue a VM restart to get things back in order: docker-machine restart default\n. Unfortunately this is all tied to the VMDisk supported by VirtualBox. Until vbox supports a good flexible schema, it wont be possible. \nAdditionally this could be dangerous as a VM could completely take over a hdd - Most VM managers force you to set the disk size\n. It looks like Virtualbox created a few networks and generate certs for the wrong one. I would go ahead and follow this guide:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#kitematic-vm-stuck-at-99-or-cannot-pull-images\nIn general you can remove all host-only networks created by Virtualbox and then start the VM creation again to fix it. \nClosing for now, but feel free to re-open if you still run into issues\n. Doesn't Get-VMSwitch require admin? How does this work for non-admin users?\n. Thanks for the info - I had previously seen some of the elevated admin rights issues and had to ask. It's nice to see this as not being a problem with the user being in the proper group. \n. Sounds like something changed in your setup since the VM was created? A missing device could indicate issues with communication - Check your HyperV settings and what device it uses to communicate with the VM\n. @pmario Since this is a pretty big change in code, could you make sure to sign your next commit?\nSee our Contributing guidelines:\nhttps://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work \n. @pmario @pflannery what version of docker-machine are you running?\ndocker-machine version\n. @floradu88 I completely understand the feeling and don't think the effort is completely wasted. \nAs @pmario mentioned the timing was less than ideal, as a lot of things happened almost concurrently. \nOne REALLY nice use-case for this PR would be to create a Windows server 2016 instance within Hyper-V and allow kitematic to communicate with it. \nAllowing everything/everyone to slap any OS within HyperV and expect Kitematic to just 'work' is a bit more of a stretch, as each may have their own set of features/settings. \nI'd be happy to pull this branch in under the main repo to make sure that the code/time spent remains relevant and doesn't go away (in case repo changes are made by either of you)\nYou both also have my email, so feel free to ping me offline if needed  :)\n. Pulling it under the main repo, not merging :)\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/tree/1541-windows-hyperv\n@pmario if you feel incline, here are some of the TP5 setup steps:\nhttps://forums.docker.com/t/windows-server-2016-tp5-docker-server-remote-management/10315/6\n. @floradu88 The windows check for the Docker for Windows isn't the best - If you have suggestions on how I could make it better, I'm open to suggestions.\nThe issue is detecting whether the user forgot to enable Docker for Windows or it simply doesn't exist. \nRight now it's setup to try and assumes the user forget to start it. \nThoughts?\n. If your internet isn't stable there isn't much we can do about this. Having a good connection is key to downloading any image.\n. I went ahead and edited your comment as it looks like you have some custom alias in place, which uses AWS?\nI would check your existing shell alias to make sure they don't over-write normal operations of docker-machine \n. Thanks for the PR and overall contribution to the project :+1:  - it's all been merged\n. Thanks for catching this and correcting the typo via a PR :+1: \n. Looking at the IP it seems you're behind a vpn or have customized something beyond the original toolbox - I would look at the wiki pages:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. The image you're requesting is quite large ~2GB - I make sure that you're on a solid network before downloading it:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/bigdatauniversity/spark/tags/\nDoes getting it via the command line work? docker pull bigdatauniversity/spark:latest ?\n. I understand this - I was wondering if you had the same result when you did it from the command line?\n. make sure that before you run it in the terminal you issue:\neval $(docker-machine env default)\nthanks @mixxmac for the input, it's true that for certain images getting the proper Tag helps.\n. error because the previous setup stopped working but isn't removed. You need to stop/remove it first:\ndocker stop bdu_spark && docker rm bdu_spark\n. Sounds like the port is already in use somewhere - what's the output of  docker ps -a ?\n. The output looks correct - If look at the error output, it's actually a rocker/rstudio error output and not a docker related error. \nThe error that the port was already in use from docker would look like:\ndocker: Error response from daemon: failed to create endpoint nauseous_mayer on network bridge: Bind for 0.0.0.0: 8787 failed: port is already allocated.\n. LGTM - Thanks for the PR :heart: \n. Thank you for the PR - Could you make sure to sign your commit, as seen in the contribution guidelines?\nhttps://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work\nAlthough I like the idea of selecting the first Machine available, this would break some of the existing functionality if the first machine was a remote one. Volume mounting being the first one to come to mind. \nI would filter your 'ls' to look for machines that have a specific driver known to work and local. \n. This is an issue with Virtualbox and mapping of user volumes - There are currently no known solution to this issue, unless you'd like to add a user arangodb with the above UID of 999 and give it access to the folder you're trying to map.\n. Restarting kitematic would not delete the VM or any containers associated with it. Unless you clicked on the button that said 'Delete VM and Retry'\nYou can check the list of VM you currently have setup by run the following command in a terminal : docker-machine ls\n. There's a pending PR to allow just that - It needs to be updated and merged (lack of time :()\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/882\n. Thanks @Bigguy34 for the work and @pmario for the review - Super helpful to have more Windows guy checking things. \nAlso @Bigguy34 don't hesitate to squash your commits when appropriate. Helps keep the master branch's history clean\n. - +1 on the Alt+F4 to close it. \n- +1 on minify being a toolbar button\n. Couple of additional notes - Could we get the kitematic word to be clickable as well?\nAlso it seems that the menu is always aligned-right for me?\n. @pmario another dev also took on the challenge, as seen in this PR:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1835\nNot sure which one should be kept. WDYT?\n. Let's keep this PR as the proper fix and go with full frames, instead of mocking with it to see what we get and hopefully simply some of the code. \n. You can do this via the command line but networking hasn't been setup in Kitematic just yet. \nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/networkingcontainers/\n. @rlam3 Can you provide the full logs where this error was?\n. If you're behind a proxy you will have some issues with connectivity. \nPlease see our workaround in the Wiki:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. Are you behind a proxy? Any certificate issue is usually a sign of a proxy manipulating it.\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. @susanwu88 Could you provide details of the error? Was this from within Kitematic?\n. Since the change is quite simple, do you mind squashing your commit into one that is signed?\n. Ping - Did you ever manage to squash all of the commits?\n. It makes sense to me and the change seems minimal\n. You can get your VM updated via: docker-machine upgrade default\n. The issue isn't your actual HDD but the space allocated by Virtualbox. \nSee the wiki to create a new VM with a larger drive:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#running-out-of-space\n. Can you provide the linux 'flavor' that you use? The original Linux Kitematic was made for debian and may have a non-generic linux shell. \nI do see the small change of the array- I think you could've simplified it via:\nvar terminal = util.isLinux() ? util.linuxTerminal() : [path.join(process.env.RESOURCES_PATH, 'terminal')];\nterminal.push(cmd);\nutil.execFile(terminal).then(() => {});\nNo?\nI'll check if the above breaks on the Mac and will push if it doesn't (since it shouldn't)\n. There's an RC for Docker-machine 7.0 which fixes quite a few things. Can you upgrade once it's released and see if your problem still exists?\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. This looks like an issue with the container setup, not Kitematic - Please submit an issue to the owner's repo:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-gateway/\n. You need to make sure you are on a solid connection to download images. I would also recommend restarting the VM if you've changed network: docker-machine restart default\n. There was a previous Feature request/PR for this, but there was almost no users who chimed in or \ud83d\udc4d the feature and thus it was never published. \nFeel free to re-implement it properly and create a feature request explaining how you're going about it.\nsee our contributing guidelines here: https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventions\nOld pr: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/834\n. @xs2github what happens when you do from a terminal:\ndocker pull fluxcapacitor/pipeline\n. The correct commands is:\neval $(docker-machine env default)\n. Couple of things:\n- Can you share that Dockerfile\n- Can you issue a docker ps to confirm the connection worked\n- Do you have any env set? env | grep -i \"docker\"\nIf kitematic can connect properly to the VM and you can create containers from Kitematic, then this is the wrong place for the issue to live.\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. That is the expected behavior, as there is no latest tag associated with that image.\nSee: https://hub.docker.com/r/lucidworks/fusion/tags/\n. 500 usually means that the container failed to create because of a specific issue with what the container needs to start - Since this is a private repo, I can't see the build, but it's not specific to Kitematic, rather what the container needs to start properly.\nTry to run it via the command line and see what the difference is.\n. You should modify your issue to be a feature request and provide details of how you would see it implemented :D \n. Kitematic only removes the VM if you click on 'Reset VM and start setup' button. I believe the error message received then points to the fact that no default VM could be used. \nThe name collision hasn't happened in the past, as most people setup their vm via Kitematic.\n. Looking through the code I see what happened. \nIf you look at the following line:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/blob/master/src/utils/SetupUtil.js#L140\nKitematic did not detect any 'existing' VM and this deleted anything that could've existed. This is in place if Kitematic attempted to create a VM and failed - It's not a true VM per vbox standard and simply exists in the void.\nUnfortunately your edge case of naming the VMWare VM 'default' falls in that category. \nThere has been some (although stale) discussion around introducing machine management within Kitematic, but no work has been done towards it in a while. \nClosing this for now but will flag it for archival purposes.\n. If you are behind a proxy that is causing some issues, look at our wiki for common fixes:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. VBox's network is a bit sensitive - If you are on 1 network and 'move' to a different network, there's a chance the VM will lose connectivity. \nIf you restart the VM after connecting, it should work as expected. \n. Do you have any env variables that perhaps get in the way?\nenv | grep -i \"docker\"\n. have you tried this again? There were a few changes to the hub that may have caused this. \n. This usually happens when an image has very specific flags that need to be passed for a container to be created. \nKitematic does not have the ability to pass on-create arguments and thus fails to create the container. \nTry creating it from the cli and see if you get a similar result. \n. Could be that a bad layer was downloaded and pulling it from the cli cleared it. \nUnless this is something \ud83d\udcaf reproducible it's difficult for us to fix\n. Thanks for the issue - Read-only file system issues have been seen in the past. I believe some of it is usually due to a bad initial setup, or vbox not doing it's job. \nI'll close this for now since you got it working but will add the proper label for archival puposes\n. I'm not seeing any issues on the server side - Can you re-try and open this issue again if the issue persists?\n. Are you behind a firewall or VPN? \nSee our wiki for possible solutions:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. You need to make sure you are on a solid connection to download images. I would also recommend restarting the VM if you've changed network: docker-machine restart default\n. @collinsauve Yes, there is some work in progress for detecting the ETIMEDOUT and supply the above command. \n. Two things can happen when this is displayed:\n1. You did not activate your account, but used the Hub Login in Kitematic\n2. You created a private repo without any billing information and are now trying to pull from it. \nFix the above and you'll be all set\n. You need to make sure you are on a solid connection to download images. I would also recommend restarting the VM if you've changed network: docker-machine restart default\n. Closing until the above template has been filled out\n. Closing until the above has been filled out\n. @jeffdm PTAL\n. Looks like the VM that you're using for development is now full (see: no space left on device) - I would clean-up the different images that may be linguering or re-create the VM with more space on it. \nSee:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#running-out-of-space\nPlease note the above will create a VM that will completely erase your existing one. \nIf you would like to remove old images, you can do so by following our docs:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi/\n. @jeffdm PTAL\n. No information provided - Closing\n. No details provided - closing\n. Latest tag doesn't exist - this is the expected behavior:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/pcomte/darkvision/tags/\n. This is the default behavior of Docker - Kitematic allows you to select the appropriate tag within the UI. \nBest practice points to having your latest image tagged as such. Unfortunately not all project follow that principle (the image listed above included).\nFeel free to open an issue within the owner's repo https://github.com/phpmentors-jp/docker-images, or look up the existing tags when not using an official image. \n. Did you also follow these instructions?\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes#add-proxy-settings-to-vm\n. 1) Correct we're even on the homepage: http://electron.atom.io/\n2) Most electron runtime should work\n3) The request  library should make use of your ENV vars, or it's been proven to work in the past. \nMaking updates to Kitematic to have all of the certs in place has been discussed before - Have you tried to use Docker for Windows?\nIf not, would you mind giving it a try to see if the experience is a bit better when working with proxies?\n. Can you guys try to use Docker for Windows instead and see if that helps resolve these issues?\n. @jmborer as @PeterMcLaren mentioned there's a good chance that the issue is due to proxy issues which is difficult to configure within Virtualbox. Installing Docker for Windows helps solve this issue partially, by removing the Virtualbox configuration/complexity.\n@PeterMcLaren when you set the env var, did you make sure to start Kitematic from the command line as well?\n. @PeterMcLaren thanks for the feedback - Do you mind taking a screenshot of how you have it setup in the main Env Variable window? I'll add that screenshot to the wiki. \n. Thanks @PeterMcLaren - Added it to the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes#make-the-proxy-settings-sticky\nIf you feel like adding more detailed steps, don't hesitate :)\n. What happens when you manually pull them from a terminal? Open 'Docker QuickStart Terminal' and run:\ndocker pull hello-world\n. I don't see why it would work from the cli, but not in Kitematic - I need more details, such as screenshot of the error you're seeing. \n. unzipping with Keka I've never had this issue - Can you download the latest release and see if the issue is still happening?\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.10.4\n. For those having the issue, can you provide a few details:\n- OSX version\n- Disk encryption\n- AntiVirus installed\n- Proxy/VPN \n. To put things in perspective, this isn't just a Kitematic issue, as it's been seen in other apps:\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/a/215372\nThe built-in Archiver utility is usually the culprit - I've never had this pop-up when using something like Keka\nTo never see this error, you can modify the privacy settings found here:\nSystem Preferences -> Security & Privacy, under General tab, next to \"Allow apps downloaded from\", \"Anywhere\" is chosen.\n. @thaJeztah The reason it's not a DMG is due to the current Packaging with Docker Toolbox. \nWith the release of Docker for Mac/Windows there may be a need to create an actual installer though for all versions.\n. @sreux If you look at the wiki information, you'll notice that the VM also needs to be setup with the proper proxy settings:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. thanks @thomasdarimont for the PR - I'll review it and will provide feedback as needed. \n. @cosmomill Would you mind sending in a PR with your above fix?. Fixed by https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/2602 - Thanks @cosmomill . By design the container shouldn't need anything from the host - What image are you using? What are you trying to do?\n. This is more of an issue for docker/docker - Can you open an issue there?\n. What would be the expected behavior behind the pinch to zoom? Shouldn't it zoom?\nWe have a PR against adding some 'zoom' feature to the logs:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1479\n. I see what you mean now - It's because of the way our window is built. There's a pending PR to correct this in Windows, but will be replicated for Mac. \nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1559\nAs a side note, most electron app behave in a similar manner. \n. Thanks for sharing @urkle I'll review it and will update our signing process to use that instead\n. Hi @wchrisjohnson,\nI would recommend upgrading to v0.10.2 where some of the triggered events are now handled better. \nAdditionally we introduced a 'refresh' feature to get the latest containers displayed.\n. @mireczatko you can click on the menubar View -> Refresh Container List\nThe shortcut of CMD+R has also been set to do the same thing. Please provide some actual details - none of what you provided help debug this\n. LGTM\n.

Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. @Opticcenter Thank you for the clean issue - Can you provide me with the output of:\ndocker-machine ip default\n. Do you have any firewall or antivirus that may be blocking communication? I've tried to replicate this without any success\n. When you run:\neval $(\"C:\\Program Files\\Docker Toolbox\\docker-machine.exe\" env)\nin your terminal, can you then run: docker ps and docker version ?\n. ps: where are you getting the output msg from?\n. Also to make sure everything was working 100%, I used a Win10 VM, downloaded the latest Kitematic and launched a new VM as you stated:\n\n. Steps I've taken to try and reproduce your issue:\n1. Delete any existing VM\n2. Create a new vm using: docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-hostonly-cidr \"192.168.59.1/24\" default\n3. Setup docker-machine env default\n4. Start kitematic (confirmed communication with VM was correct)\n5. Open quick start terminal and start container. \nAt this point it seems that there are some unknowns about your setup/env which are making this difficult to debug. For example, why are you specifying the hostonly-cidr. Additionally I would wipe any Virtualbox network interface prior to trying this again. \n. Can you open Virtualbox and show all of the Network adapters it created?\n. it seems that you have something different in your OS preventing this from working properly - I've setup 5 Windows VM back to back and was able to install everything properly. \nAt this point I would recommend trying our Beta of Docker for Windows. \n. Regarding the ICON, we had similar issues when packaging the Windows installer. \nYou can try to link to the raw image withing github:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitematic/kitematic/master/util/kitematic.ico\n. @adomenech73 Do you mind doing 2 things?\n1. Squash your commits into a concise list. Having 2-3 commits that explain the progression of the code changes is good. Having commits that change a package version or small tweaks, isn't\n2. Sign your commit according to https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work\nThanks \ud83d\udc4d \n. Setting up a new debian box to qa this pr and will then merge. Thanks again for the help! \ud83c\udf89 \n. Doing some QA on this, I missed a few things and added some in-line notes.\nThe Windows built was separated so that Kitematic could be build in Windows, without having to build the Mac release. \nIt looks like your PR is making a similar exception, but doesn't full-fill the other side of it which is the Mac build should build all: OSX+Win+Linux.\nThis line:\nhttps://github.com/adomenech73/kitematic/blob/2ccf907ab0656284761a0ecd4a854ed7c3784f62/Gruntfile.js#L354\nShows the complete build of OSX + Windows.\nWe can be opinionated in choosing 64bit instead of 32.\n. The windows build only requires mono - brew install mono works :)\n. Hmm got a Kitematic (Alpha)-linux-x64 folder, but didn't see any .deb?\nLast line after linux_shell:\n```\nRunning \"electron-packager:build\" (electron-packager) task\nPackaging app for platform darwin x64 using electron v0.35.4\n    dist/Kitematic-darwin-x64\nDone, without errors.\n```\nIf I add the electron-installer-debian line to Mac OSX, I get the following error:\n```\nRunning \"electron-packager:build\" (electron-packager) task\nPackaging app for platform darwin x64 using electron v0.35.4\n    dist/Kitematic-darwin-x64\nRunning \"electron-installer-debian:linux64\" (electron-installer-debian) task\nCreating package (this may take a while)\n\n\nError creating package: Error reading package metadata: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'dist/Kitematic-linux-x64/resources/app/package.json'\n```\n\n\nThis is because the electron-packager builds something based on the platform+arch, which is incorrect when ran on OSX.\n. Error when trying to create this:\n```\nRunning \"electron-installer-debian:linux64\" (electron-installer-debian) task\nCreating package (this may take a while)\n\n\nError creating package: Error executing command (spawn fakeroot ENOENT):\nfakeroot dpkg-deb --build /var/folders/kl/4fm2zyxs3_5dd869x992dvvw0000gn/T/electron-116426-7519-otee50/Kitematic_0.10.2_amd64\nWarning: Error executing command (spawn fakeroot ENOENT):\nfakeroot dpkg-deb --build /var/folders/kl/4fm2zyxs3_5dd869x992dvvw0000gn/T/electron-116426-7519-otee50/Kitematic_0.10.2_amd64\n Use --force to continue.\n\n\nAborted due to warnings.\n```\nBut then Brew to the rescue!\nbrew install dpkg fakeroot\n```\nRunning \"shell:linux_npm\" (shell) task\n\n\nnpm\nWARN\npackage.json\nKitematic@0.10.2 No README data\nmixpanel@0.3.1 node_modules/mixpanel\n\n\nRunning \"electron-packager:osxlnx\" (electron-packager) task\nPackaging app for platform linux x64 using electron v0.35.4\n    dist/Kitematic-linux-x64\nRunning \"electron-installer-debian:linux64\" (electron-installer-debian) task\nCreating package (this may take a while)\n\n\nSuccessfully created package at ./dist/\n\n\nDone, without errors.\n```\nIf you don't mind checking that this package installs properly for you that would be HUGE!! \nhttps://goo.gl/oSQy86\nSo pumped about this, thank you again for all of the hard work \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 \n. Did you install and follow the readme instructions?\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. Although Windows driven, there's a PR to modify this:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1559\nHelp move it along so that it uses native buttons :D\n. @nshiell having different CSS per OS would be ok IMHO as long as the experience is 'similar' - When are you thinking of pushing a PR?\n. @sr105 Although the projects are related (Kitematic is in Toolbox), the proper location to file this issue is here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/toolbox\nThanks\n. You mean the ability to detach the container detail from the overall view?\nWhat would that look like?\nHow would you detach them?\nHow would you re-attach them?\nWhat happens when you click on a container that has a detached window?\n...\n. Please see a possible fix in our wiki:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. Seems like this could've been a simple network issue - Could you re-try?\n. I like this idea, but that would mean that labels/tags are applied to these containers to categorize them.\nHow do you envision this working?\n. We've tried to stay away from user-files and support of x-y-z format. This can lead to a lot of errors simply because the user didn't create the config file properly. \n. it's not easy, as you found out - One good thing is that we can leverage the Web LocalStorage system. \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API\nWe just need a way for the user to add these labels and make sure that upon re-creation they live. Having an outside source of truth would be best, although we all have our own way of keeping things organized. \n. I like the idea - How would you differentiate a container name from the actual compose name prefix?\n. Could you try it with any other programs mentioned here: http://electron.atom.io/ and report findings?\nps: obviously helpful if they are OSS\n. Every container I remove gets removed. Can you share your version of kitematic and Docker?\n. You're mentioning hyperV yet I see no information as to a hyperV use-case within the steps and details you provided. \ndocker-machine restart default points to using Virtualbox; Not being provided with your exact setup/steps to reproduce makes it extremely difficult for me to find the issue you mention. \n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. Looking at the steps you provided, having any container started is causing this. I run containers 14/5 on my laptop and havent' had this issue.\nYou're providing some information about Apple VNC, can you be more specific about what's actually happening, exact steps to reproduce (setup VNC as server or client? install teamviewer? what exact image are you using, etc?)\n. It's possible that some of the rendering done with Kitematic impacts the speed of refresh. \nThis is unfortunately out of scope.\n. Running Kitematic through an Apple VNC and mentioning that the refresh rate of the VNC is an issue with Kitematic seems to be a bit far-fetched IMHO. \nKitematic is a desktop management tool - If you're looking for a remote management tool, there are other products that can do this for you; Docker Cloud is one of them and manages 1 node for free\n. LGTM merging\n. LGTM\n. Thanks for the report - IMHO It seems that this is more of an Android Studio issue, which doesn't play nice with other Hypervisors. \nDocker for Mac has the same warning for Virtualbox 4.3.3, but this was fixed by Virtualbox in later version aka you can run Virtualbox v5x and Docker for Mac at the same time. \nAdditionally this was previously reported here:\nhttps://forums.docker.com/t/cant-using-docker-for-mac-with-android-emulator-haxm/8939\n. tbh this has nothing to do with Kitematic (kitematic has no golang code) - For the purpose of moving things along, what image did you pull for this to happen?\n. If you're using a VPN, please checkout:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\n. I'm not sure what this actually adds?\nIt seems that you're adding a label to then over-write the label font and make it normal again?\n\nTop is your PR\nBottom is Kitematic 0.10.3\n. Any chance you'd consider doing the same thing for the Preference panel as well?\n\n. LGTM - with a small comment\n. @jeffdm PTAL\n. Thanks for the ping, going to merge it, as it LGTM\n. Good catch, not sure how it got removed as I can't find the source of the change. \nI'll review your PR and will merge it. \nThanks\n. LGTM\n. I would rather have the ID in the 'General' tab - Having it in the sidebar doesn't have any true value. \nEverything you can do with the ID you can do with the name, which kitematic has created for you. \ndocker inspect ff9d - not very friendly\ndocker inspect example2 - is more approachable \n. I would put it after the name and under the SAVE button as it isn't something that can be changed. \n. Esthetically it would be better IMHO. Ping @elesant \n. Merged! Thanks @ClemMakesApps \n. Interestingly enough, the #1191 was opened for a workshop as a way to show students how to look through issues, implement a solution and create a PR for it ;)\n. You provided no issue details or step to reproduce, which is why this issue was closed. \nTo search for images, please go to https://hub.docker.com\n. Please edit the first comment with the proper information, steps to reproduce, etc.\n. Is this the image?\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/s4ragent/oracle-rac/\n. What happens if you do the following in a terminal:\ndocker pull s4ragent/oracle-rac:latest \n. Can't see your image...\n. Thanks for the report - Can you provide us with the output of docker images from a terminal?\nIt seems you have some dangling images which are possibly causing this 500 error. \n. that's exactly the dangling image I was referring to - \n. What image are you referring to? What happens when you do this via the terminal instead of through kitematic?\n. We try to be creative when doing a docker exec the problem is that most containers don't have bash which means that we default to sh to make sure we can get into all containers. \nI believe if you do $ docker exec -it python sh you'll see the same thing. \nChanging to bash once you're in is pretty straight-forward.\n. Unfortunately this would break the container, since the runnable command would fail. \n. @twocs FYI not all images have bash which is why it couldn't be used as the default shell. . Is this for Docker for Mac?\n. Since this isn't Kitematic related, please use the Docker forums\n. @dmenne With Docker for Mac/Windows allowing more flexibility on folder share, this is something we're working on changing. \nI'll keep this issue open to keep track of it and will close it once it's in master. \n. With Docker for Mac/Windows being more broadly use, we should be able to add more folder support - the previous issue was related to the complexity of mounting the user folders within the VM. \n. @destenson I think we can keep this issue as the main one, but I'll change the title to reflect the above discussion/exchanges\n. if docker ps is showing no container, then Kitematic wont be showing anything either. \nIf this is with Docker for Windows, please open a thread in the Docker forums, as seen in the docs link you received, with your logs and steps to reproduce. \n. ping @jeffdm \n. Can you try to install the following package?\nhttps://goo.gl/oSQy86\n. @wwarlock It will be in the release tab of this github repo.\n. I've been thinking about it for a while now - A lot of packages are old and should be updated. \nIf you're up to the challenge I'd enjoy seeing this cleaned up! :D \ud83d\udc4d \n. I've seen it creeped it from times, but can't always pin-point where the children with the same key come from. \nOpen to suggestions to track it down. \n. Some PRs have been submitted for this but nothing concrete came out, as it would meant that all machines have been properly provisioned. \nFeel free to create a PR for this :D\n. @stephendrew My points were as follow:\n- What happens if your machine doesn't use the common port?\n- What happens if it uses a different version?\n- What happens if it uses a custom driver?\n- What if the VM has certain mount points that differ from the 'common' ones?\nIf you look at the amount of available drivers for docker-machine here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/drivers\nYou'll see that ALL of them would need to be implemented/supported by Kitematic.\n. naming isn't the issue, it's the drivers used with that name. It just happens that we selected default as the name. \nWhat do you gain from having multiple VM with the exact same setup?\n. I see - if you'd like to look at it, I'd be happy to review it. \nAt this point we're more focused on Docker for Mac and Windows, and the separation of container environment could be made with compose files.\nThere's an on-going thread about integrating compose. \nI'm open to suggestions also on allowing kitematic to show different stack of containers based on a certain filter. \n. LGTM\n. The current syntax is in place to support both pre-2.9 and 2.9+ iTerm.\nThe original PR can be found here: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/855\nWhat caused this re-write (if it's just a cleanup, I'm all for it!)\n. I like the simplification and this works quite well for me even when tested against the iTerm 3.0 nightly.\nThanks for the patch \ud83d\udc4d\n. Seems about right. I can modify the extension to be consistent with all of the other release files. \n. @alexandrev sorry for breaking it, should've double-checked on windows - I'll fix it tomorrow\n. ?? no clue what you're hinting at or what the issue is\n. LGTM @alexandrev can you confirm this to be working for you?\n. Going to merge this to get everyone unblocked - Sorry about that.\n@adomenech73 If you feel like figuring out a better way to do this without the warning on windows, would be great. \n. @bdharris08 I'm open to suggestions on how to do this cleaner. No clue as to what the differences are as well.\n. Hmm still seems broken for me :(\nThis is an example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n. what do you get when you run:\ndocker pull sonarqube from a terminal?\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. Can you merge master into this one?\n. Couple of UX things:\n- Can we make the 'search' box more visible? Maybe adding a top white border?\n- Add a find icon perhaps similar to atom's:\n  \nFinally, it would be really nice to have the Find + Find Next as part of the menu item, under edit - This will also allow the declaration of the shortcut keys and make them viewable to the user. \n. Sorry for the delay in checking this - I'll take a look tomorrow and will provide some feedback. \n. I can't seem to come up with a good way to target the current container selected while in the menu - We may need to add some sort of place-holder to keep track of the currently selected container.\n. @ClemMakesApps WDYT about having a tracker for 'current' container detail shown and use that to allow the Find menu\n. I have it running via my editor - it would be cleaner to have it as part of the npm script. \n. yup - I think we can safely replace it.\n. It's actually difficult for me to replicate even with 5 hello-world-nginx type containers showing. \nI like the simplicity of the fix which should prevent duplicate keys. \nThanks.\n. No info provided - closing\n. This isn't a Kitematic specific - Please create an issue in https://github.com/docker/docker\n. Shooting for the stars indeed, especially with the 'recording' of commands to create a compose file.\nRegarding the docs, the formatting can be quite awful even on the actual Hub pages and why we didn't want to pull them in. There's an icon that allows you to quickly get to the docs.\n. The source repo is at the discretion of the user and shown on the Docker Hub page.\nIf all users were equally 'open' about how their image is built, it would be nice, except there are no standards related to source, Dockerfile, tags etc. \nThis causes a lot of logic to be added to the app for not a lot of return.\nRegarding the the Dockerfile docker --save you should open a feature request in the docker/docker repo :)\n. Of course keeping the image lean is a huge \ud83d\udc4d  in my book, but not always the case.\nHere's a pretty good example:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/cloudera/impala-dev/tags/\nAlthough they are 'sharing' the Dockerfile, it doesn't really tell me why we're downloading a 5GB image. It has great documentation and some good explanation of what's going on, but some digging is still needed. \nThat varnish image is a great example. They use FROM ubuntu:14.04 yet perhaps an alpine image could be used to do the same thing and save space :)\ndisclaimer: I'm playing devil's advocate here as to why it's difficult to do the right thing\n. LGTM\n. @spsoni What version are you running? The latest version fixed this:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n@jeeftor The command you posted has nothing to do with any of the above. \n. Already tracked here: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1704\n. Sad to see this one being such an issue. LGTM\n. @SalvorinFex I missed your earlier issue, but please also understand that our conference, DockerCon is coming up which keeps us pretty busy. \nI tried to replicate your issue without any success. Can you try to logout of your Hub account and see if the image downloads?\n. the 10.0.2.3 is the internal Docker Daemon IP - If after a few reboots it started working, there's a good chance the networking didn't work as expected, but finally did. Perhaps an update was pushed in the middle somewhere?\n. Not enough details provided. \nPlease fill out the template.\n. Not an issue with Kitematic - Open an issue with the image owner. No latest tag exists:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/nazarpc/webserver-apps/tags/\n. If you open Kitematic - you can click the x next to all of the containers. \nYou can then go to the My Image tab and similarly, click the ooo to see the 'Delete' button for each image. \nIf you feel like nothing is worth saving, you can do:\ndocker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)\nto remove all containers\nthen:\ndocker rmi $(docker images -q) \nto remove all images\nplease beware that the above deletes EVERYTHING\n. @sbacic Can you check if the Ubuntu release .deb has the same issue?\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases\nIf you can send a fix it would be greatly appreciated!\n. @sbacic Haven't released the latest patch - the .deb is actually a .zip.\nmv Kitematic-0.10.5-Ubuntu.deb Kitematic-0.10.5-Ubuntu.zip\nunzip Kitematic-0.10.5-Ubuntu.zip\nYou can then try to install the proper .deb in the dist/ directory\n. It's possible that it's in the newer version - If you don't mind looking at it, it would be helpful. \nRegarding the package, it's possible that signing is needed somewhere. Probably something we should add.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the feedback - All of these seem manageable to update/change.\n. @adomenech73 Ahh thanks for chiming in on this. Do you think this is something you could take care of?\n. @sbacic Thanks for the help - I believe we now have a better deb package, which is still wrapped in a Zip file. \nIf you'd like to fix the following it would be of great help:\nLintian check results for /home/sbacic/Downloads/dist/Kitematic_0.10.4_amd64.deb:\nE: Kitematic: bad-package-name\nE: Kitematic: package-not-lowercase\nE: Kitematic: maintainer-address-missing Kitematic\n. It's been merged and is in the latest release:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.1\n@sbacic can you confirm that it looks good?\n. Not enough details provided. \nPlease fill out the template. \n. @werebear73 As you can see the error complains about the Tag latest not found.\nIf you look at the hub repository:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/bettervoice/freeswitch-container/tags/\nYou will see that indeed it does not exist - Select a different tag before clicking 'Create' and you'll be all set. \n. 2 things:\n- Get the latest Kitematic, the ENOTFOUND should be better.\n- See the wiki to change your VM's disk size: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#running-out-of-space\n. 1. docker-compose stop or docker-compose rm :)\nOtherwise feel free to create a PR for it, if you're up for it. I'd be interested in knowing how you picture this working on the UI side. \n. @DuckThom there was some missed version updates. A new release will be made early next week, which should amend those mistakes.\nThanks for the issue. \n. this is the expected behavior - Doesn't look like they have a tag of latest:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/rancher/os/tags/\nOpen an issue with them. \n. Hi @khanshakeeb The latest version of kitematic found here shouldn't be causing this issue. \nCan you provide details of your OS?\n. @vincenzocaruso @aledelgo Kitematic has a preference for Docker for Windows. If you're still on Virtualbox you then have the ability to click on that button and use it. \nWe're working on a better way to check this, for the Kitematic start-up to be cleaner. \n. @deividfortuna As explained it's as-expected, as we have a slight preference for a Docker for Mac/Win setup \n. @vincenzocaruso Can you verify that this release works as expected:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n. I agree that when passed as such, the jenkinsci/jenkins repo should be the first one to show. \nKitematic's search behavior is consistent with what Hub shows:\nHUB:\n\njenkinsci/jenkins is the 3rd repo.\nKitematic:\n\njenkinsci/jenkins is the 3rd repo.\n. Hello @sabbir360 Can you try the pre-release created today and let me know if the issue persists?\n. Are you behind a proxy? Can you share details about your setup?\nI've created 5 jenkins containers on 3 different machines\n. :) thank you for reporting that Kitematic isn't the issue. \nI would look into the setup of NAT + Firewall. \nWe have some info on 'proxy' setup here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes\nEssentially you can ssh into the VM and try to ping the outside world from within. I'm guessing it can't for some reason:\ndocker-machine ssh default will get you in the VM\n. Good question - the details of your issue explains none of it it seems :(\n. is this on a fresh install? Did you have any other mysql containers previously installed. \nI can't replicate the issue on my end\n. Please re-open if the issue happens again. \nThanks\n. No information provided - Closing\n. I don't understand - There is a download status already:\n\n. @klousiaj Can you try the latest release? \nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\nWe removed some 'animation' bits that were causing high cpu usage\n. This is the expected behavior, as the Jira instance doesn't have any tag. \nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/atlassianfan/jira/tags/\nPlease file a ticket with them \n. What did you try?\nWhat happened?\nWhat did you expect?\n. Timeout -> try again plz\n. @bilal966 Not sure what you searched for or clicked on - I followed the exact steps that you provided and get a proper download:\n\n. @ErrolSayre Can you provide a link to the Docker Hub image you're trying to download?\n. @banesto if changing network allows you to pull, then it's more than likely related to your own network. \n. @banesto Unfortunately this is outside of the scope of Kitematic, as it's related to your particular network setup more than the tool itself. \nI would start by confirming that you cannot pull outside of the VM, then inside of the VM and try normal network-related stuff to gain some knowledge as to why your network is blocking this. \n. @lbfrantz Please try the latest release, which includes a proper fix:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n. @vicanfon Make sure you followed the docs on sharing the folder:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives\n. Looks like you're using an external plugin to handle xhyve - Please open an issue with the plugin owner.\n. @ReneVallecillo Why not use Docker for Mac? https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac\n. The image is 2GB - make sure you are on a stable internet connection. \nTry to do a docker pull bigdatauniversity/spark2:latest\n. @aniqurrehman it sounds like the container failed to be created - I would advise you to read the docs on the image as to what needs to be passed to it for the container to be created properly.\n. Instead of allowing an empty port to unbind, it would be cleaner to allow the port mapping to be removed completely, thus unbinding it. \n. My fear is that users leave a port blank in order to trigger a 'random port' and are surprised by the result vs expected.\n. There isn't any listener for push, but you can always click the tab again to force a refresh.\nFeel free to implement it and submit a PR :)\n. LGTM\n. Please see the documentation on allowing docker commands as a regular user in Ubuntu:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group\n. This is a duplicate of a previous issue.\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1637#issuecomment-210924052\nFor unknown reason, OSX attrs are added to certain downloads, see:\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129966/files-wrongly-considered-as-damaged-in-encfs-volume\nTo solve it, run:\nxattr -rc /Applications/Kitematic\\ \\(Beta\\).app\nA reboot and re-download can show a clean download as well. \n. Ping @elesant \n. Please provide steps to reproduce and screenshots to help understand what's going on\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. Works as expected - If you look at the hub tags available, phpmentors never created the latest tag. \nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/phpmentors/symfony-app/tags/\nPlease open an issue with them\n. A couple of things are confusing - you're mentioning Docker machine, but seem to be running the Docker for Windows beta?\nIn that case, docker-machine restart default wouldn't work. \nThe timeout only happens if you clicked on 'Use VirtualBox' - I would check that docker ps first works in a simple PowerShell window\n. @VeryKross That command should only shows up if you selected Virtualbox within the UI, option which would've showed up if the native setup didn't work.\ndocker-machine is not involved with Docker for Windows \n. @pmario There's already an open issue for it :)\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/issues/3543\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. @randalllj It's not just that image, it's all images - Seems to be an issue with Docker Hub.\nA ticket has been dispatched internally and it seems to be working again\n. Sounds like you're behind a proxy/firewall?\nPerhaps give Docker for Mac/Windows a try?\n. for record keeping purposes, would you mind sharing what you did to get it working, so that other users may get this information as well?\n. It looks like the error isn't very descriptive, but the error is actually in the image itself. \nIf you try to run it manually via docker run brogersyh/sqlexpress you'll see that the error it gives is:\noci runtime error: Cwd must be an absolute path.\n. Sorry there was a light issue that caused this. It's all working as expected now\n. Clicking on Use Virtualbox is the proper option. \nWith the release of Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows, Kitematic is biased towards those setup, instead of the old Virtualbox. \n. Feel free to get the current public beta of Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows:\nhttps://www.docker.com/products/docker\n. I upgraded my Home edition to Pro - just need to purchase it from the Windows Store for $99.\nThe integration of Docker for Windows is seamless, compared to some of the issues people have found with Virtualbox\n. There's a bug that is currently being worked on:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1836\n. @vdillon thanks for the quick patch, but this isn't the proper fix. \nThe pre-release has been created and can be downloaded to verify that it's working as expected:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n. @Kylvan @mtrevor Latest release is available here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/tag/v0.12.0\nCan you please give it a try?\n. @smolinari unfortunately the releases are separated right now. There's a few patches in the pipeline and we'll update Kitematic. \nThanks\n. It's currently being discussed internally  :)\n. If this is using VirtualBox please see:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#running-out-of-space\nOtherwise delete some of the images stored on the VM to clear-up some space.\n. This is a known issue. https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1643\n. Could you use Docker for Windows and see if the problem persists?\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n.

No information provided - Closing\n. @komocode Thank you for the report. This is similar to https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1802 as the error provided isn't detailed. \nYour solution however was at the top of the changelog when moving from RC2 to RC3:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot/#/recreate-or-update-your-containers-after-beta-18-upgrade\nThanks for the info.\n. I'm not sure if I understand why logging in made a difference.\nEach container can have it's on set of requirements which makes it impossible for us to provide the appropriate messaging.\nThe proper approach is to read the documentation provided for that image and confirm that you're doing everything it's asking you to do. \n. 1. I open Google Chrome on Mac OSX\n2. I click on the green button in the title bar\n3. Google Chrome is now fullscreen mode\nThis is \ud83d\udcaf  the behavior that kitematic follows and just about any other app I believe. \n. missed the OPT+Click didn't even know this existed. \nIt seems to only maximize vertically?\n. @mikaoelitiana We've discussed re-using the normal frame. \nIf you want to take a shot at doing this, it may solve a few of the above issues, along with a streamlined look and feel for each OS\n. Looks like it's related to https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/24344 - Closing in Favor of the docker/docker issue.\n. Thank you for the issue report - We now favor using Docker for Mac/Windows when possible. \nLooking through the logs it doesn't seem to be an issue with your custom virtualbox setup, but rather an issue when creating the hostnet interface - Did you not click 'Accept' when prompted to do so in Windows?\nVBoxManage.exe: error: Failed to open/create the internal network 'HostInterfaceNetworking-VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter'\nCheck Virtualbox directly, it looks like the VM was created but the interfaces weren't. \n.

Hi @thomasdarimont thank you for the PR - Would you mind signing your commit to comply with our Contribution Guidelines?\nOtherwise LGTM! \ud83d\udc4d \n. @garu57 Do you start kitematic within the PowerShell or with the Desktop shortcut?\n. @garu57 That's why - the Launch menu shortcut will not know about the custom env var. \nYou can modify your env vars in windows, so that they are used across the board and that should fix it. . @garu57 thanks for providing a bit more detail - When Kitematic starts, it tries to determine if a VM exists and if that VM can be started. If it cannot, then it will create a new one from scratch.\nCan you do the following:\n1. In Kitematic open the Chrome Dev Tools (CTRL+SHIT+i)\n2. Go to the console tab\n3. Type the following:\nvar path = require('path')\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar util = require('./utils/Util')\nvar machine = require('./utils/DockerMachineUtil')\n4. Provide the output for the following:\n machine.name()\n util.home()\n path.join(util.home(), '.docker', 'machine', 'machines', machine.name())\n fs.existsSync(path.join(util.home(), '.docker', 'machine', 'machines', machine.name()))\nThanks\n. @garu57 that's what I was afraid of and why Kitematic can't seem to find the VM, because it doesn't see your User specific env vars.\nCan you try to add them within the System Env Vars instead?\n\nOtherwise you may need to add them to the shortcut :(. Can you add [WIP] to the title, so we know it's not final - Also would you mind signing your commit to comply with our Contribution Guidelines?\n. Changing the hub endpoint isn't the only change needed - There needs to be an authentication mechanism in place to allow users to authenticate against that registry. \nHow is this handled here?\n. @deanwong getting kitematic to read the proxy settings is a bit tricky. \nWhat you can do however is make sure to make your proxy settings globale, by following:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes#make-the-proxy-settings-sticky\nThen start Kitematic from the command line. \n. Do you think you can fix the layout for windows, so that it's consistent with Linux+OSX. \nLogin button on the left, kitematic logo on the right?\nLike:\n\n. @mikaoelitiana In case you missed it, there were some nice topics here as well, regarding menu behavior: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1559\n. A couple of things weren't smooth in the mentioned PR and unfortunately the original dev wasn't able to finish it :(\n. I'll give it a shot - thanks for the help\n. @Bigguy34 It may be a lot easier to do so - the original intent was to keep a similar look and feel across all OS, but seems to add some un-needed overhead. WDYT?\n. Closing in favor of @Bigguy34's PR #1559\n. @artuross thank you for the report - There is a change in Docker for Windows that breaks the current logic - A fix is being implemented and will reference this issue when merged.\nThanks. \n. @artuross Do you mind giving this freshly baked version a try:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw5EwLyGjFkQQWFVc1hsRVpac1k/view?usp=sharing\nIf it works for you I'll go ahead and make it a release. Thanks!\n. @artuross unless you have Docker for Windows, then you'll see the error - I need to figure out a better error message. \n@lilonghe works without issues here and I see all of the data - Are you on Docker for Windows or Virtualbox?\n. @GeoffreyEmery The new release was just created today with the proper fix. \nThanks for the detailed issue - Let me know if you encounter any other problem\n. Are you using Docker Toolbox? It looks like you're behind a proxy, is that correct?\n. Thanks for the report - there's a similar issue for users with private repo previously opened:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1643\nWe parse on the first : when it should really be on the last :\n. If you download the latest Kitematic release from this repository, you will get the proper error. \nThanks\n. Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n.

Closing this issue due to lack of update/activity - Feel free to re-open if appropriate.\n. Can you open a terminal and provide us with the output of:\ndocker version\n. Could've been a temporary issue - It looks like you're using the Docker Toolbox. \nI would recommend using the native Docker for Mac, as it may solve a lot of the vbox issues you are facing. \n. Are you on stable connection? Hub has seen a couple of time-outs which are being investigated. \n. There is no resume - when you close your laptop the connection is cut and this will need to be re-tried with a proper connection. \n. @unixben with 0.12.0 being the latest release, this is not a valid issue. \n. I'm able to pull all images from the homepage - If you start Kitematic from PowerShell, do you have the same issue?\n. I'm not having the same issue and able to download the image without any issue. \nCan you try again?\n. @mercuriete @Moulick This has been implemented and will be in the new release of Kitematic. \n. @Moulick it was part of this PR https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1878 and will be release shortly\n. No information provided - Closing\n. @evelynwightman Feel free to submit a PR for it :D. No information provided - Closing\n. It sounds like some env variables or startup scripts are causing this. JVM isn't a dependency of Kitematic and thus unrelated. \nI would look at the shell startup scripts and see which one is causing this. \n. @drubarth Do you mind sharing your findings so that others with the same issue can fix it as well?\n. Can you make sure that you have a stable internet before downloading the image.\n. @anggun-indra sorry to hear that your office makes this less than ideal to work with.\nIf it's possible you should download Docker for Windows\nps: since this is an issue outside of our reach, I'll close the issue, but feel free to comment on it as needed.\n. Please update to the latest Kitematic to get the proper error instead of the [object Object] you're showing above. \n. @pslootweg How did you install it? I'm only asking because the error report should be more detailed. \nThe error you're showing was fixed on 0.11.x\nCan you list the exact images (and tags) used so that I can reproduce on my end?\n. Please let me know what the version is, so that I can ping the right people to get the links updated. \n. I am unable to replicate this issue, as you haven't provided the exact tags used for each image and the settings used for them as well. \nPlease provide them, so that I can see the error for myself. \n. From kitematic, port mapping is done with a random port and why it wasn't showing any errors from me. \nProviding very little information about the issue you're having makes it difficult for maintainers to determine the root cause of it. \nYou mentioned JIRA in your first thread (with no info on the version/tag used), yet it seems to have nothing to do with your issue. \nHence my point that replicating this through kitematic is impossible.\n1. Create Postgres container, random port is assigned:\n\n2. Assign the Postgres port:\n\n3. Create a new Postgres container, random port is assigned:\n\n4. Try to assign the port of 5432 results in an error:\n\nProviding us with exact repeatable steps, with the environment that you're in and with screenshots (as I did above) would help me understand the issue you're having. You did none of this until your last comment. \n. That's correct - Running containers are the only ones that tie a port; non-running containers wasn't part of the original discussion. \nWhen you hit save we don't dynamically update the container, we re-created it, which then triggers the 500 error that you're seeing, granted the error should've been more verbosed than [object Object].\nIn the latest version you will see something like:\n(HTTP code 500) server error - driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint postgres (4e5c8753bcc5b37d4613755a0d1832571da819757f076797dce51417453d2db3): Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated\nI'm not sure if there is a good way to handle this; technically a non-running container should not prevent you from creating another container and using that port. \n. Works as expected - There are no tags 'latest' defined for that image. See the Hub link:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/casadocker/alpine-wildfly-postgresql/tags/\n. This is working as expected - If you look at the gremlin-server list of tags, latest is not one of them:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/htaox/gremlin-server/tags/\n. That order wouldn't work well, as the normal behavior for Kitematic is to create the VM if it doesn't exist. \n. No information provided - Closing\n. This PR fixes it: \nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1878\n. @lferro9000 The down-arrow with image size is actually inaccurate, as it does not represent the size of the image.\nThe down-arrow actually represents the amount of downloads for an image. \nif you look at Redis on the All tab of kitematic, you'll see that those numbers match what's on hub's explore page:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/explore/\n. No information provided - Closing\n. I have a few private repos and have been able to pull from them without any issues. \nDo you get any errors?\n. Unfortunately we need a small time-out to make sure that the request to the native docker is actually not working and not just slow to respond.\nIn the following PR: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1878 we added support for a preference panel to save the preferred docker engine (native or virtualbox).\nI'll see if we can reduce the time-out to speed this up. \nThanks for the great issue detail\n. Aside from personal preference on the name, the VM created should be something somewhat hidden to the user. \nEssentially you can have all other VM, but the default is Kitematic related. \nFeel free to provide a PR that allows one to set a name within the preference panel:\nRelative info of where the machine name is picked:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/blob/master/src/utils/DockerMachineUtil.js#L17\n.

Kitematic doesn't read many ENV vars, simply because they aren't set globally but rather set on a per terminal basis. \nFeel free to open a PR to make it work. \n. This behavior works for me just about every time. It could be that you're on a different virtualbox than the one used by kitematic?\nEither way I can not reproduce this reliably - We did add a 'Refresh Container List' option to the view; if this happens again, you can refresh the list, which usually fixes this. \n.

I'm open to suggestion - Feel free to mock up what it would look like \n. What you're seeing is images that properly declare the volume that they allow user to map - Unfortunately not images are made equally, which results in no volume mapping shown.\nFor Kitematic to display the option, the image needs to have a VOLUME entry. Some early work was done to allow none-exposed volumes to work, but it hasn't been touched in a while:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1202\n. @bemcculley Kitematic detects the VOLUME entry to show the mapping, it's not a question of needing it for mapping to work as @aaomidi alluded to.\nThere is no functionality in Kitematic to currently map a folder outside of the container to a folder inside of the container. \nIF someone wants to pickup the different PRs and make something happen, then it'll be in Kitematic. \nIt's an OSS project, anyone can contribute and help make it better. :).

The + button is only to add a rule for existing exposed ports - there's a PR to allow ports to be added by the user, even if they're not exposed by the image. \nThe image should be built properly and expose the ports/volumes it uses which the user can map.

Are you using Docker for Windows? Did you make sure to enable file sharing for that specific folder location?\nWhat is the output of the above docker run command without the -d option?\n. Zedtux's linux version is no longer current, which could explain some of the issues. I would recommend using the master branch, as we have a proper debian release package. \nKeeping everything else in mind, the main reason this didn't build properly, is that you're making the assumption that node 0.12 is to be used. If you look at the travis.yml file, we currently use Node 4.2.2.\ninstall via:\ncurl --silent --location https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -\nand it should make without any issue\n.

You can simply run containers without it, as Docker for Mac handles all of the heavy lifting. \n. Unable to replicate as solr downloads properly for me.\nWhat happens if you do this via the terminal:\ndocker pull solr:latest\n. Container time should always be in UTC, but depending on the image/settings, you may get something slightly different.\nFor example, when I run the memcached image you mentioned above, I get:\n$ date\nWed Aug 31 13:07:39 UTC 2016\n.

Then go to the Volume (under setttings) and use the above created myapp folder.\nOutput from the kitematic console log:\n\nI never added the METEOR_ALLOW_SUPERUSER env variable. I am also using Docker for Mac. If you don't click 'Save' the ports will not be retained.

Are you behind a firewall or VPN? \nSee our wiki for possible solutions:\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes. @mateodelnorte Unfortunately corp firewalls have been pretty difficult to fix with Virtualbox - The latest Docker for Mac and Windows do alleviate this pain. \nI see that you're on Windows 7 which is unfortunately not supported at the moment. \nThe issue is the complexity of the corp firewall settings, which involve a bit more than a simple 'flick' of a setting in kitematic. As you can see by the steps described in the wiki, some changes are within the VM on top of Kitematic being ran from the CLI to pickup the firewall details. \n. @mateodelnorte it's a lot more complex than just kitematic - Kitematic is only an interface that talks to Docker. \nThis means that if you can't do docker pull  .... via the command line, Kitematic isn't going to magically solve this. Since you're running Docker Toolbox, I would encourage you to read:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/\nThe wiki doesn't say to setup a proxy, but mentions that the 'firewall' you mention is more than that, it's really a corp proxy that changes how SSL is handled, as @ajlanghorn your connections to the outside world are being mitm'd. What I mean by this is that instead of doing:\nyou < ---- > Google\nit does:\nyou < ---- > Corp Proxy < --- > Google (corp proxy is what you call the 'firewall')\nsome ref on the difference: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-firewall-and-a-proxy\nWhat the wiki suggests is to obtain the proxy information as seen above, and simply add them to the VM so that it can talk to the outside world properly. .

You can keep all of your containers on the same network if you'd like - For security purposes, containers on the regular bridge network cannot use service discovery, although you could use the regular container IP; but that IP may change. \nSee: http://mfranc.com/blog/docker-containers-communication/\nPreviously you used the IP of the VM to communicate to the container. \nYour mysql request would be something like:\nWP -> VM -> MySQL -> VM -> WP\nWith proper container network:\nWP -> MySQL -> WP\nFYI: you don't even need the mysql port to be open (exposed), since the containers use a Docker-specific network to talk to each other. It's simply convenient for you to be able to login to mysql from the outside. . you mean create a udn, attach a container to it, then delete it and restart the container that had the old network reference?\n. There's definitely a lot of user induced errors that could be made and unfortunately Kitematic doesn't have a lot of capacity to handle all of the test cases (gracefully).\nThe 'flashed' error is all that we get from the daemon, which then gets pushed to a full kitematic error, although not very descriptive.

When Kitematic configures a volume, it's actually destroying the old container and re-creating it. \nSince we can't detect the permissions of the shared folder until the container fails, we cannot prevent the user from doing this. Additionally there isn't a wait on the resource from the daemon. \nIt is best for the user to check that the folder they're trying to use has the proper permission first, as documented here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives\n. @Chematronix  Completely understand where you're coming from - When kitematic was first created, one of the biggest problem was sharing volumes with Virtualbox. By default only the \"user\" directory was shared in order to provide light guard-rails with what could be shared. \nThe concept of updating what seems to be your container, by silently destroying it and re-creating one with the same name has caught a few people off guard. With advances in the Docker product being done by multiple people, kitematic simply lacks the resources it needs to capture all use-cases and better the product. \ud83d\ude1e \nTL;DR - If you can't easily detect it when you do a docker run then it will be difficult for Kitematic to do this as well..

Some of the above are 1gb. What version are you running? I'm unable to reproduce this in 0.17.2\nadded a max-width thinking that was needed\n\nwithout any fix at all it looks the same\n. Didn't realize this was an ubuntu specific issue... can someone look at setting a max-width on content, if it helps?. Open up the chrome developer tools, as you would in regular chrome - You can then play around with the CSS. . To bring up the developer tools, the same keyboard shortcut use on Chrome, can be used in Kitematic (we use electron).\nCan you try max-width: 100% ?. ctrl+shift+i works for me - if you can figure out the max-width that works well, it would be helpful, since I don't have the proper env.

Logout and log back in using your docker id not your email. . Make sure that you can do a docker pull of the image and we can go from there. . @vilas27 For Kitematic to pickup the proxy, you will need to start it from the CLI, so that it can read the env vars. \n@lroellin \nIf you use Docker for Mac then it'll work as expected. . @lroellin I don't understand, Docker for Mac has nothing to do with logging in to Hub. You can also do so from Kitematic.. This is resolved, I'm closing the issue. . @vedydev @korykim please provide actual steps to replicate. \nClosing until steps are provided. . The behavior would need to first change in machine - default has always been the go-to for deployments and thus somewhat \"reserved\" for the Boot2docker provisioned VM. \nWhat happens when the env var is set, but the machine doesn't exist?. Here's part of the complexity, say you're doing a lot of docker-machine things and to make your life easier, you set the ENV var to be machine.\nIn order for the ENV var to be \"seen\" by Kitematic, Kitematic would need to be started from the CLI (not very convenient for most users)\nThis VM isn't a boot2docker image, but it's what you use for X project.\nYou then decide to open Kitematic from CLI, as you've done before, with the changes you've mentioned above. \nIt wont connect. You forgot that you had the ENV, and think Kitematic is being silly not finding your default vm and click the \"Delete and try setup again\". You've now blown away your X project machine and may be mad at Kitematic (even though you told it to do it)\nTL;DR - it's easier to tell people that default is the Kitematic preferred VM, and the one that should always be used for boot2docker things, rather than providing complex options as to what VM/Driver combo should be used.\nps: the above is why the patch you mentioned above was pulled, as we had a lot of users complaining that the new VM selector destroyed some VM machine other than default.. @Yivan there is a \"choice\", as the software is OSS and thus can be modified by you to do what you want. \nThe origin of the tools were as such and thus have remained. I understand your need, but also see the simplicity of keeping a Docker tool as the default target. \nEven though it can now do much more, there's quite a lot that's ok to have as the default. \nKitematic was suppose to prevent the hard-entry into the Docker CLI by simplifying the creation and connection to the VM. If the default was taken by something else, than Kitematic would not be able to connect to it. It will then give you the option to destroy it in order to start fresh, but will not do it without you clicking the button. .

Pulling from the CLI to replicate an issue in Kitematic, means that you should be fair and pull from the same source. \nThe image of docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.1.3 is pulling from the repo of docker.elastic.co and not Docker's own repo (hub.docker.com).\nLooking on hub, Elastic decided to deprecate their hub maintenance:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/\nI'm not sure why they did that, but I would open a ticket with them to explain how annoying it is that they can't do a simple docker push to docker's hub.. Kitematic is designed to only work on images that are hosted on Docker Hub that's correct - Kitematic is a Docker product, made to work with Docker's registry. \nThe image you downloaded via the Elastic registry doesn't have the same namespace as the one downloaded from Hub. This it doesn't actually spin up the same image, and (hypothetically) it's possible that the hub image is intentionally not working, thus forcing the user to lookup where to properly download it. . It's not hard-coded to break for anything, it just happens that the image has different requirements. You see the same error by running it via the CLI docker run elasticsearch - there is no such thing as roadblocks/proprietary code here. \nIf there is something that you think is missing, or it should do, then please feel free to open a PR. . I understand that pulling the latest image from the registry that Elastic built, will give you a working image. \nWe're not responsible for keeping the images that are on Hub up to date, thus its at the discretion of the company to do so.\nDoing a docker pull elasticsearch will pull a completely different image than what you've listed and the root cause of your problem:\nelasticsearch             latest              60ce0d08d205        2 weeks ago         581MB\nDocker store is a different storage, as it's pushing for container images that have been certified, hence the location of the image will be what the company chose. \nKitematic uses the community based images, which may or may not work as expected. .

I believe this to be incorrect - The new location should be:\n~/Documents/Kitematic/<container's name>/\n. Not necessary, as it's commented out :P - I should delete it completely to prevent any further confusion. \n. Can you fix some of the indentation here?\n. With the look and feel of local vs non-local images being different, I'm not sure how to get around the big if/else statement. \nReact wont allow partials that aren't properly nested. Any suggestions?\n. I had some errors with lint because of the inconsistent return - I'll make the changes\n. I'll update it to a try-catch; this was re-using existing code for simplification, but might as well update it. \n. To confirm - I'll remove the namespaces call, use only the orgs obtained and append the username to the list?\n. Shouldn't the above (preferences and about) be cleaned up as well (no root '/' since part of the parent)?\n. I think removing the initial '/' from their path is good for now and matches the work done above. They already are outside of containers, which is how it should be.\n. Good suggestion, although a lot looser, but should work nicely - I'll make the proper updates and will push it.\n. missing semicolon\n. Can we convert these to imports to match all other files?\nAlso dialog and setupUtil are declared but never used (remove?)\n. can we use machine.name() instead of 'default' ?\n. It wasn't - just now merged it. Good catch\n. Only change I would make is rename the var to something that doesn't match the method name:\nvar matched\nvs \nvar match\n. I think npm recommends doing a try/catch on readFileSync instead of doing an exist check.\nlet logData = null;\ntry {\n  logData = fs.readFileSync(logsPath, 'utf8');\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error(e);\n}\nreturn logData;\nps: the note was with fs.exists() but I think it probably still applies: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback\n. Can we remove this debug?\n. Do we want to keep this debug/log ?\n. Seems that attach() and logs() do very similar things, could they be merged into 1 method?\n. Can you fix the indentation and check that spacing around keywords 'if' are respected?\n. Don't comment out code, simply take it out - We have git versioning to roll back if needed\n. If a user adds a shared directory, it will only be seen until the next kitematic restart - Is this the correct approach?\n. Is this used anywhere?\n. Same as above, make sure this matches ESLint specifics (spacing, indents, etc). \nIf you're using Atom.io to do your development, you can install the 'linter' and 'linter-eslint' packages. The .eslintrc file should then do the rest.\n. this var can be removed since you no longer check for the home dir. \n. haha no such thing as the master, just an observation. I think you're right, the user would add more folders and restart or start kitematic after making the changes. \nWhen in doubt restart, right?\n. If this is an array of mounted folders within a VM, shouldn't that be a VirtualBoxUtil.js variable instead? this.folders = elements; ?\n. Unfortunately I don't think this is correct - Doesn't Passing the entrypoint as the cmd to run result in the final cmd be:\nentrypoint + entrypoint\nPreviously it was:\nentrypoint + bash\nWhen no cmd is found, but an entrypoint is, It should just be\nentrypoint\n. Can you remove the console debug here\n. ES6 - You shouldn't need to do 'that' for 'this' :)\n. Although it looks like a typo, this is actually correct, as we opened a 'terminal into the container', hence the use of 'Terminaled' as a verb \n. This prevents the 'native' check on start-up since that's the default. \nIf your socket is present (but broken) saving this preference allows the bypass of the socket check\n. I only want to throw an error if both the name and the IP are unavailable. When setting up a socket, I don't need a name, I can just use localhost (although a bogus name could be passed)\nWhen we pass the VBox setup, theip and the name are needed to verify the machine and cert location.\n. is copy:osx actually needed here?\n. Why the 2 if cases - these should be combined. \n. May have to wait for this one - Current link preview is broken when VPN is enabled\n. Can this say ++ ?\nIn my app I get this:\n\n. This should probably be removed, but everything else looks good - I'll merge finally!\n. Missing space here\n. eslint favors key:      value vs key     :    value\n. Anyway to avoid using an inline element as a block-level element?\n. Here and below, can you fix spacing?\n} else if () {\n. fix indentation for 6-spaces not 7.\nif you use atom to edit things, get the linter + linter-eslint packages\n. Looks better IMHO - Thanks!\n. Since we're re-writing this piece, can this be renamed to something like handleClickPortSettings?\n. Unfortunately this doesn't always work - If no-network has been set, you're creating the container for the first time, you'll end up with:\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'Networks' of undefined\n. Why is host network filtered out here? Granted for 99% of the cases it's best to avoid it. By default the container will be attached to the bridge network. You cannot have both the host and some other network, but can create a container with the host network:\ndocker run --net host --rm -it alpine sh\nWith that said, if the host network is selected, all other network should be deselected.. I've had a couple of errors generated here, while using the hello-world-nginx:\nCannot read property 'length' of undefined\nAlso can you fix the indentation?\n. Rename to Stats - Status is something different and shown in the top title bar. \nIt's truly resource usage statistics. Can you fix indentation for all of the lines below?. Should we add a date/timestamp there as well?. missing ;. missing ;\n. Can you confirm that you  can still build and launch this on osx/windows? last update to Electron caused some issues for me. . I would perhaps label this differently, something like Enable 'always' restart policy\nBy definition, the always policy does a lot more than just start when docker starts:\nAlways restart the container regardless of the exit status. When you specify always, the Docker daemon will try to restart the container indefinitely. The container will also always start on daemon startup, regardless of the current state of the container.\n. default should be Name: \"no\" not Name: ''. Default should be Name: \"no\", not Name: ''. As soon as I \"unfollow\" I end up being thrown to the top of the logs - Anyway to capture the current scroll position and simply keep the user there?. ",

I haven't changed anything in VBox directly, I've just been using Kitematic and never actually open the VBox manager or manipulate the VM.\nI'm inclined think there is some sort of timing thing happening related to when the VM starts. I get varied behavior starting and stopping Kitematic. Sometimes the container list populates, sometimes it doesn't.\nHowever, if I use the VBox Manager to start default, wait for it to come all the way up and then start Kitematic the list seems to populate every time.\n. I've created a gist with two files:\nno-containers.docker.log \ncontainers.docker.log\nHaven't compared them in detail. I do see that the successful one has a bunch of events selecting containers at the end the unsuccessful one does not.\n. :+1: \nLooking forward to seeing what you guys come up with.\n. Hurray @alexandrev :100: Seems to do the trick!\nI cloned your branch (issue-1355) and started up Kitematic with the VM completely shutdown.

I just ran it again and didn't see the same behavior. Looking at the loop I don't see how it could be your code, but wanted to mention it. Either way, I love the fix.\n. When running off @alexandrev's branch issue-1355 I could not reproduce the issue described in #1331. Kitematic seems to reliably wait for default to start completely before populating the container list. \n. Significantly improved. Good work. Will mark as closed in v0.12.0.\n. ",

    "psychemedia": "+1 on being able to mount/link a data volume container against eg a database container to provide persistent storage.\nIt could also be useful to be able to map the data volume container against a directory on host? Though I think there may be some filesystem issues with this at the moment on Macs at least? eg https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/581\nIt would also be useful to be able to create and restore a db backup into a data volume container, though I guess this could be done via the command line atm rather than a 1-click solution? eg using something like this recipe perhaps (which I have to admit I haven't tested...): http://alvinhenrick.com/2015/01/26/docker-backup-and-restore-volume-container/\n. So in general terms, would it be possible to support plugins for different cloud host providers, so I could eg create profiles with Digital Ocean or AWS or whoever (along with a default corresponding to the Kitematic default docker host) and then select the appropriate profile when I create the container (or just drag a hub image onto whatever profile context I want to launch that container in?)?\n. @mchiang0610 I'd quite like a couple of compose features:\n- a selection of \"composition\" icons that relate to compose files rather than docker images, from which I can launch a particular composition;\n- a composition editor, in which I can drag container images onto a canvas and then wire them together to create a skeleton for a compose file that can then be filled in with other properties (ideally, graphically).\n. @jhabdas Apols: that was probably meant to read as something like docker-compose up -d or docker-compose up start.\nAs to containers appearing in Kitematic, I've noticed in recent versions sometimes they do, sometimes they don't... Not sure how much I trust Kitematic any more:-( Which is a shame, because I thought it held real promise as an app runner for users who won't go anywhere near the command line.... Complementary to docker-compose support is being able to use Kitematic to build and seed a container from a Dockerfile + supporting files.\nThe original MyBinder project (now part of the Jupyter project as binderhub) would dynamically build an image from a github repo. The O'Reilly Launchbot does something similar on the desktop - but again, without support for docker-compose.\nThe reason I mention it here is that whilst the proposal for docker-compose support in Kitematic helps those of us wanting to use Kitematic to support use, by non-technical users, of linked Docker containers as part of a personal application workbench, we're still left with the problem of how to distribute things like a files as part of that workbench.\n(An example use case might be a non-expert users who knows simple SQL and wants to be able to query across mixed JSON and CSV files from a Jupyter notebook UI using Apache Drill, but who doesn't want to have to worry about installing those applications and setting up the correct links between them. In addition, they may have data files and Jupyter notebooks they want to be able to share with other non-expert users using a similar workbench setup.)\nSo I'm now imagining the following scenarios:\n\nKitematic as an application that can pull down pre-built images and launch them\nKitematic as an application that could pull down pre-built images and launch them as part of a docker-compose composition\nKitematic as an application that can build one or more images from a source repo (or config zipfile) and launch them as linked containers\nKitematic as an application that can pull down a pre-built image and then copy in data files from a source repo or zipfile to a linked volume\n. Any chance of this getting added sometime soon? I use Kitematic as a local app launcher, and one of the images I've started using requires a fresh start each time from the base image, which is a faff having to try to remember the name of the image each time I want to launch it.\n. @TeckniX Thanks for this, and apols in delay getting back to you (as a node novice it too me a while to figure out node start!;-)\n\nThat looks quite handy, thanks... Thinking about how I might use that currently, I would:\n1) generate an api.json file that contains links to course related containers on eg docker or my own remote docker hub, that are required (i.e. recommended) and also use these as the basis for the search and info lookups too;\n2) allow students to then fire up containers required for the course as and when they need them (and not provide them access to other containers...).\nThinking now as an educator putting a distribution together for use in distance education, where we tend to try to lock everything down, I can imagine:\n1) setting up the containers I want my students to use;\n2) exporting the containers (i.e. saving the container images)\n3) putting the images into containerImages/\n4) somehow getting the api.json to look into containerImages/ so it can load the containers from there?\n(I realise this may all go counter to how folk think of using docker, but I'm currently working within a constraint that can be imagined as shipping a student a DVD-ROM from which they have to install and run everything they need, whilst hoping that in future we can move first to an 'install from web' mode of operation, eg pulling containers from an online institutional repository. )\nThinking across more that one course, I might want to somehow separate out multiple recommendation panels that eg list containers associated with different courses (so the same container may be listed in several course sets). These then generalises out further to inbuilt support for fig/compose style configurations between sets of containers within a course specification, which I think relates to other issues/feature requests.\nIn terms of UI, I could imagine a panel that contains buttons that select different api.json feeds - so eg one for dockerhub, one for my institutional dockerhub, one for a local api.json file etc. - rather than having a preference selector? The ability to add in (+) additional feeds, or delete currently registered ones (-) would then naturally follow?\nShould I have tagged this featureCreep?!;-)\n. @jawz101 I also came across another use case here: emulation as a service in the context of digital preservation. An example of the UI and workflow they use can be found here.\n. +1 on this needing some sort of resolution. I guess the UI requirements are:\n- default is latest\n- allow user to select an arbitrary tag instead of latest\n- offer some sort of alternative in the case of going with default an latest not being available?\nWould one option be to have a drop down list of tags displayed when an image is selected, defaulting to latest (if it exists) or most recent tag if it doesn't?\n. Is this the same as the issue raised in https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/581#issuecomment-70596122 ?\n. I just noticed this too.\nI also tried explicitly searching for an image with the :TAGNAME qualifier and this failed to find the parent image? (that may be a dockerhub search issue though?)\n. +1\nI'm looking at using kitematic as a containerised app launcher for distance education use, which means that we're always for looking to be able to configure s/ware distributions for lowest common denominator, naive user, use.\n. +1 on there being an easier way to manage the upper size limit on the VM from somewhere within Kitematic.\nOne of the powerful features of Kitematic for me is that it makes it possible for relative novices to make use of container run apps/demos in a GUI environment - but expecting them to work on the command line before launching Kitematic is too much of a stretch...\n. I have a set-up for a course on databases and data management that runs an extended scipystack plus mongodb and postgresql, as well as an openrefine container (some explanatory context here). One of the activities uses quite a large dataset (a national road accident dataset and a whole bund of shapefiles) spread across a sharded mongo db.\n(Finding effective ways of managing prepopulated databases and configurations that can be distributed efficiently to students is another issue, eg see https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/513 in this context also. A second issue is the ability to easily create and run docker-compose configs from within the UI environment. I was going to blog some thoughts on that when I get a chance.)\n. @FrenchBen re: mapping the volumes - I seem to recall I had a problem with that on a Mac? (I'm right at the limit of my skills/knowledge with all this - an optimistic technologist, rather a sysadmin/devops person!;-)\nAlso - how would that work for a distribution? If I have a large database, I don't really want students to have import the data, index it etc? The route I am taking is to build a virtualbox box with prebuilt images, and some prebuilt data volumes. Students then use vagrant and vagrant-docker-compose to fire up the containers and link directly to the prebuilt volumes.\nI guess an alternative distribution route would be for me to build the databases, seed them, export a backup, distribute the backup and then let students fire up db containers, create new linked/mapped volumes and then restore the data from the backup (eg on a USB stick) into a mapped data volume? I haven't tried that route yet... (things not helped by the fact that I'm not a db admin either so don't know how to do that basis dbadmin stuff anyway, let alone in a container context!;-)\nBeing able to make use of docker-compose in kitematic context would be really helpful, I think. I'd quite like a GUI option so I could create a new composition, drag images from the Kitematic sidebar into it to specify a container of that image type, name the container on that canvas, and then use a graphical tool to wire them together:-) I'd also want to be able to open a panel that lets me specify properties etc of each container. In addition, split the left hand sidebar into available images and available compositions.\n. @FrenchBen I tried that but couldn't seem to mount database directories onto host though (on a mac; building the machine via vagrant-docker-compose). This is odd, though, because I can mount the host notebook folder for my IPython notebook server container and also a host directory for an OpenRefine server container's project files...\nJust checked the Dockerfile again and it seems I ran the successfully mounted container as privileged. Setting the db containers as privileged won't let me mount them against host though, nor can I get linked data containers to mount against host?\n. I'm seeing this as well - containers have just disappeared (maybe half a dozen or so).\nMac 10.9.5, Kitematic 0.9.5\nCLI had stopped launching a terminal window too in an on-running Kitematic (Mac had been hibernated); worked okay on a Kitematc restart, but still no containers?\n.

My apps should be running as containers there, right?\nIt turns out I can do this:\n```\n$ dig @172.17.42.1 kite-dns.kite\n; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> @172.17.42.1 kite-dns.kite\n; (1 server found)\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 57927\n;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;kite-dns.kite.

But there's no app to connect to, and hence no DNS entry for it. Clicking \"Restart\" on the app doesn't appear to do anything (other than log \"restart app\" to the JS console), and the Logs screen for both apps I have \"running\" is black.\n. I changed the title to reflect what's really going on: the apps aren't running at all.\n. That's what I did, and all I saw was kite-dns. The application containers aren't running.\n. Just restarted again, opened Kitematic, and things still weren't running. Then I destroyed all of my apps and images and rebuilt them all, and now the apps are running. The remaining issues:\n- I don't know if they'll start running again if I restart. I can't go though a restart right now, but more to come, I suppose.\n- I was also missing the route as described in @Gurpartap's comment on #51. The only part of that I had to run was\nsudo /sbin/route -n add -net 172.17.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 -gateway 192.168.60.103\nThen everything was working again.\n. Ah, I see there's an 0.3.0 release. I'll give that a try.\n. I still see this on 0.3.0. I'm starting to understand what's going on a little more, though. After restarting, I see that the app container exists, but is stopped. The same is true of the DNS container. So after restarting, I have to:\n1. docker start kite-dns\n2. docker start each app\n3. Add the route (sudo /sbin/route -n add -net 172.17.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 -gateway 192.168.60.103)\n(I'm pretty sure those steps can go in any order.)\nNotably, during the entire process and after it's complete, my app (I have only one at the moment) on the Apps view in Kitematic.app has a spinning grey circle. Its log view is empty. Restarting Kitematic.app changes neither.\n. I've deleted ~/Library/Application Support/Kitematic and ~/Kitematic and the VM from VirtualBox and reopened Kitematic to let it rebuild. Now it appears to be working.\nThe only thing left is that I'm still seeing the ubuntu images in the image list. Perhaps that's now the intended behavior?\n\nI'm still seeing the images shift around. Specifically, the ubuntu images periodically change the order they appear in. I don't have to do anything to make that happen, it just moves.\n. That makes sense. I'm still not clear why they kept turning red and green. It looks like Kitematic was trying to run them all? And if one of them exited, it would re-run it in a loop?\n. Huh. I've been using boot2docker without Kitematic running for a few days, and now that I look at it, it is in fact on 192.168.59.103. I thought they were both trying to bind to 192.168.60.103, but I think it was just boot2docker shellinit/ip getting stuck on the Kitematic IP for some reason.\nJust now, I've brought up Kitematic and told it (thought the GUI) to start its boot2docker. Some interesting results:\n1. boot2docker ip just became 192.168.60.103. (boot2docker --vm=kitematic-vm ip is the same.)\n2. docker ps (which should be connecting to the boot2docker-vm) is now hanging, with no output, and then timing out:\n2014/10/28 11:46:38 Get https://192.168.59.103:2376/v1.15/containers/json: dial tcp 192.168.59.103:2376: i/o timeout\n3. In a separate shell, I wanted to try to communicate with Kitematic's Docker, but I can't even set that up now:\n```\n   $ boot2docker shellinit\n   error in run: Error requesting socket: exit status 1\n$ boot2docker --vm=kitematic-vm shellinit\n   error in run: Error requesting socket: exit status 1\n   ``\n4. Perhaps for the same reason, the one app I have in Kitematic has a grey spinning circle icon, and its log is empty. The images tab is populated with the images I'd expect, though.\n5. I can ping 192.168.**59**.103, but not 192.168.**60**.103 (ping: sendto: Host is down`).\nHere are my boot2docker infos, if they're still useful:\n```\n$ boot2docker info\n{\n    \"Name\": \"boot2docker-vm\",\n    \"UUID\": \"4dc8fe69-bad4-4752-a124-0706525fe87c\",\n    \"Iso\": \"/Users/peeja/.boot2docker/boot2docker.iso\",\n    \"State\": \"running\",\n    \"CPUs\": 8,\n    \"Memory\": 2048,\n    \"VRAM\": 8,\n    \"CfgFile\": \"/Users/peeja/VirtualBox VMs/boot2docker-vm/boot2docker-vm.vbox\",\n    \"BaseFolder\": \"/Users/peeja/VirtualBox VMs/boot2docker-vm\",\n    \"OSType\": \"\",\n    \"Flag\": 0,\n    \"BootOrder\": null,\n    \"DockerPort\": 0,\n    \"SSHPort\": 2022,\n    \"SerialFile\": \"/Users/peeja/.boot2docker/boot2docker-vm.sock\"\n}\n$ boot2docker --vm=kitematic-vm info\n{\n    \"Name\": \"kitematic-vm\",\n    \"UUID\": \"b36bf9bf-719c-4801-9062-a8c26cf56d40\",\n    \"Iso\": \"/Users/peeja/.boot2docker/boot2docker.iso\",\n    \"State\": \"running\",\n    \"CPUs\": 8,\n    \"Memory\": 2048,\n    \"VRAM\": 8,\n    \"CfgFile\": \"/Users/peeja/VirtualBox VMs/kitematic-vm/kitematic-vm.vbox\",\n    \"BaseFolder\": \"/Users/peeja/VirtualBox VMs/kitematic-vm\",\n    \"OSType\": \"\",\n    \"Flag\": 0,\n    \"BootOrder\": null,\n    \"DockerPort\": 0,\n    \"SSHPort\": 2022,\n    \"SerialFile\": \"/Users/peeja/.boot2docker/boot2docker-vm.sock\"\n}\n``\n. And a little more: I tried stopping Kitematic's Boot2Docker though the GUI, which did in fact stop the VM (according toboot2docker --vm=kitematic-vm status`). I still saw the same issues with the default VM as above.\nNext, I restarted the default VM with  boot2docker down and  boot2docker up. The issues above disappeared, and I could connect as usual. Clicked \"Start Boot2Docker VM\" again, and all the issues above returned.\nCuriouser and curiouser.\n. @a-b What happens if you shut down Kitematic's VM and then down/upthe default one, as I said I did above? That makes it work for me, at the expense of not using Kitematic at the same time.\n. ",

    "dlamblin": "@jeffdm Yes it is still worth having a way to select. I'm on a mac with 10.10, the latest terminal seems to have reached par with iTerm and has a couple of things iTerm won't do, like alt-arrow moves between words on the bash prompt (I'm sure it's configurable somewhere) or right click anywhere to spawn a man-page window of the word you're clicking on.\nEven if it's a pref that must be set with defaults, or just a checkbox that says \"prefer Apple terminal\"\n.

The button would be a call to action and make the roll over more noticeable. The toggling of the gear is a logical thing I found myself attempting. One thing to note for that is that the menu item for preferences and the command-, (windows uses a hotkey too?) will need to either stay non-toggling, or update the text of the menu item once in preferences. Possibly to \"Exit Preferences\".. I think my work just booked the next few weekends for not prime time support work. I'll see when I can make time to do it.. ",
    "uberhacker": "Echoing @mickaelandrieu: Windows powershell is terrible.  Essential control keys like backspace and arrows don't even work.  Please make this configurable.  Kitematic is a great tool and you guys have done a great job so far.\n. ",
    "alankent": "It would be good to be able to use a shell of choice (cygwin comes to mind), or get TERM set correctly or powershell (if such a thing exists) so when you docker exec into a container you can use vi or less. Powershell does not support the xterm escape sequences completely, making vi pretty hard to use.\n. What is even more interesting is \"Docker Quickstart Terminal\" works well on Windows. But Kitematic does not use the same terminal type, using Powershell instead. Even if not configurable, using the same terminal window as Quickstart would be a big improvement.\n. What is even more interesting is \"Docker Quickstart Terminal\" works well on Windows. But Kitematic does not use the same terminal type, using Powershell instead. Even if not configurable, using the same terminal window as Quickstart would be a big improvement.\n. +1\nWe spun up https://docs.docker.com/registry/, added username/password authentication (tied into an internal authentication database, which is why we cannot use DockerHub.com), but then could not work out how to make Kitematic work with it. Unfortunate.. I would like this too, but because when I have a login to the Docker host I want to set TERM to something so I can use \"vi\" and \"less\". As far as I can tell, Powershell does not support cursor moving escape sequences, but using Cygwin as the shell does. And export TERM=cygwin seems to be recognized by modern versions of Linux.\nIf there was a TERM value that supports Powershell that would actually be preferable (for me).\n. I forgot to say next to the container id it says \"Updating\" in a blue box as well. Not sure what that means.\nAnd I can confirm when I removed Grunt and LiveReload (removing \"EXPOSE 35729\" as well), I started being able to mount volumes again - the container restarted reliably. I then just added the EXPOSE command back in. I had the \"docker run\" going in a window, and I managed to capture this output on the console when it tried to shutdown the container. (I suspect this is MariaDB shutting down, but including in case useful.)\n(Oh, note there is no running process listening on the port I exposed - \"grunt watch\" when run should start listening on that port, but I was going to start that up from the command line after the container is running.)\n```\nStatus information:\nCurrent dir: /var/lib/mysql/\nRunning threads: 0  Stack size:

I think the caching problem is related, but I don't understand why restarting such a simple container to mount a volume causes the failure.\n. I unzipped and ran the binary - things were better, but a little strange. To be sure, I rebooted my laptop and started fresh. This time it all looked good and sane. I can mount a directory and it works. Thanks!\n. Using 'less' in busybox gives a fatal error and it drops back to Windows terminal emulator window.\n$ docker run -it busybox\n/ # less /etc/passwd\nFATA[0062] The parameter is incorrect.\n$\nThere is no /lib at all in busybox, so no /lib/terminfo etc describing what \"xterm\" means. Changing TERM to 'xxxx' does the same thing as \"xterm\". Basically I think busybox is a super cut down version of binaries with the terminal escape sequences hard coded into the binaries (no way to change it). So it is not useful for testing TERM settings. No matter what TERM is set to, it does the same thing.\nTry using ubuntu\n$ docker run -it ubuntu\nroot@9055e364b93d:/# vi /etc/passwd\nI did some copy/paste to make file longer, then tried ^Y and ^E (display one more line at top or bottom of screen) - messes up the screen.\nroot@9055e364b93d:/# less /etc/passwd\nDid not abort window immediately, but output was only a single page.\nroot@9055e364b93d:/# cat /etc/passwd /etc/passwd /etc/passwd /etc/passwd | less\nType 'u' and 'd' to scroll up/down half a page - screen gets messed up quickly.\nLooking in /lib/terminfo there are terminal definitions. But 'xterm' (and 'cygwin') does not work well.\nAlso using vi plays up, but it is worth noting in Ubuntu \"vi\" is \"vim\", unlike busybox where \"vi\" is a special cut down binary with a single terminal type built in.\nThe fact that 'vi' does work in busybox seems to indicate there is a set of escape sequences that the terminal emulator works with well (ignoring 'less' crashing out for some reason!). I just don't know what terminal type to use for a Linux container that supports TERM settings.\nThanks!\n. Well I am baffled. I tried on another machine and works perfectly. I will try and reinstall my own laptop. Sorry for the distraction.\n. I don't know who reserved the port, just that it is reserved. http://blog.bananacoding.com/blog/how-to-connect-to-the-docker-remote-api-using-kitematic-and-boot2docker-for-mac indicated Kitematic was using port 22 to talk to Docker, but I could not find that code in the repo. And it would have been docker that picked the port number it is listening on. So you may be correct.\n. I just got a new laptop, setting it all up. I got this problem when trying Kitematic out too. I don't have a proxy. The problem turned out to be Docker Engine failing to download images (not Kitematic). Running docker commands to download images from the command line was also failing (it just hung). Being on Windows I did a reboot ... and that cleared the problem - everything worked fine after that. So I suspect this error message is an indication of a docker engine problem downloading images, not a Kitematic problem.\nThe message I got was:\n(HTTP code 500) server error - {\"message\":\"Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io on [::1]:53: read udp [::1]:35914->[::1]:53: read: connection refused\"}\nNot a very friendly Kitematic error message!. I am not from kitematic, but did you try the \"My Images\" link in the top right corner? That lists images I have built locally.  (Is that what you mean by \"load local image\"?). ",

    "zedtux": "+1\n. Do you know more or less when a Linux release would be available ?\n. Thank you @caske33 :)\nYou can pull my repo, I have (partially) implemented the 'Exec' and 'Docker cli' buttons.\n. Both buttons are doing the same thing which is to open a terminal in the container. Which terminal emulator are you using ?\n. Sorry, not the terminal but the terminal emulator. For instance, on GNOME, it's gnome-terminal\n. Alright so it's should work. You should have a new terminal opening (after having clicked one of the buttons) with a # which means you're in the container. You can also use hostname and you should see something like 8b0f6fa60721.\n. Previously you told me that you're using docker version 1.0.1 ? It seems that the exec docker command has been implemented in docker version 1.2.0.\nCan you upgrade docker ?\n. You're right, I have the same behavior. At least, we're inline now :)\n. Thank you :)\n. I've tried the 'Docker cli' button on Mac, and it's doing the same ... Open a console on the host machine ... so it's seems to be correct :)\n. Last update (As of now all seems working now but feel free to notify me if something is remaining):\n- Update fonts for logs and UI (Use Ubuntu font for UI and DejaVu Sans Mono for logs)\n- Remove 'VM Settings' from settings menu when running on Linux\n. @tlongren and @mchiang0610 is all working fine now ?\n. @caske33 you're more than welcome ! I'm really happy that this is enjoyed by couple of people ! :+1: \nRegarding the .deb and .rpm packages, I have some knowledge for .deb packages but it's not my best area. I would prefer that a really packager is doing it (especially for Debian as they have a lot of rules and so on) but I'm completely free to help in case it's needed if there are some questions and for testing the package on Debian.\n. @caske33 your packaging solution will produce a .deb package, but I do believe it will not be compliant to the Debian folks. Unless you don't care to have Kitematic in the official Debian repo, it should be done in the state of the art in order to get it accepted.\n. Thank you @redeemed2011 for the details. I personally prefer to use sudo but it's nice to have this kind of documentation.\n. The merge request has been opened.\n. @funkymonkeymonk you're the author of this issue. I believe we can't go ahead without your validation :-)\nCan you please take the time to test my portage ?\n. I will change the 'Finder' mention. I've noticed it and forgot to change it.\n@sanderboom is mate-terminal installed in /usr/bin ? Also what is the flag to use to execute a command ?\n. @sanderboom and @caske33 the 'Finder' mention has been replaced in the PR.\n. @sanderboom please do a git pull and try again for the 'Docker cli' :)\n. Cool, thank you @sabatesduran :)\n. @mickaelandrieu you're not stupid, you've just missed an information. It's okay :)\nI'm surprised that there would be not 32 bits version of Docker. What Linux distribution do you use ?\n. @mickaelandrieu you was right:\nfrom https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/\n\nDocker requires a 64-bit installation regardless of your Ubuntu version. Additionally, your kernel must be 3.10 at minimum. The latest 3.10 minor version or a newer maintained version are also acceptable.\n. Thank you @nakedhitman for the details and I have to admit I'm agreeing with you. @TeckniX do you agree with that ?\n. @pvangundy to be more clear, your issue is when npm is installing the module native_mate. There is a compilation step which requires the file ../deps/v8/include/v8.h from the path /opt/kitematic/node_modules/grunt-electron-installer/node_modules/asar/node_modules/chromium-pickle/build.\n\nTo be honest ... I don't really see why it's not working. I'm sorry to not help more on that and I don't think that this issue is the right place to discuss the issue.\nIt looks like the issue is related to the grunt-electron-installer module at the end of the day. Maybe you should open an issue on the grunt-electron-installer project.\n. Thank you @FrenchBen, let's do it this way ! :)\n. Sorry @who-me, I don't really understand the issue. There is a file missing while compiling a module ... I would recommend you to search on google.\n. > We'd probably need some sort of try/catch and provide a link to the wiki to the user.\n@FrenchBen can you please give me the URL of the wiki page to be shown when the symbolic link x-terminal-emulator doesn't exists ?\n. @sanderboom when I was developing the Linux support, I always has to do CTRL+C in order to really stop the app, but I think this due to the auto-refresh mode (Doing a change in the code, saving the file is reloading the app automatically).\nNow how will this be out of the development box, I don't know, and I guess @mchiang0610 or maybe @FrenchBen could answer this question ?\n. For all: The Linux support has been merged in master yesterday ! @FrenchBen this ticket can be closed :)\n. @fnkr I did the implementation but I'll not take care of the packaging.\n@FrenchBen while waiting for a perfect packaging, why not just building a binary like it's done for Windows and OSX ?\n. That's true my initial goal was about to make it working on Linux. Regarding the binary building, it shouldn't be that complicated thanks to electron and Grunt and Linux should be quite close to OSX.\nUnfortunately I don't have the time.\n. What about Debian? Usually you create a package for Debian which is then available for Ubuntu.\n. +1111 !\n. I have a first version of this feature working (adding new volume, setting the folder, see the volume in the container and read/write files from container and from host).\nThere are still some updates to do especially when removing volumes.\nIt doesn't really make sense I'm publishing my code for now as I'm branching from my Linux fork. As soon as done, in the case the Linux portage is not merged I will do another branch originating from master and test on OSX.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\n. I have solved the refresh issue with the LOCAL FOLDER when using 'CHANGE' and 'REMOVE' buttons.\n. @affogato sorry .. what ?\n@pik0 have you cloned my repository and then checked out the branch linux/features/add-volumes (BTW are you running Kitematic on Linux as the Linux portage is not yet in master and I need to use it in order to contribute to the project so my branch is Linux only for now ...)\n. I have opened a pull request with the final implementation. All the details are in the pull request and the pull request has been done without the Linux support so that you can test it @jeffdm, @kematzy, @gregorydickson, @bauschan, @Blux, @jb510, @ajermakovics, @nym, @mchiang0610, @alexj, @affogato and @pik0.\nFeel free to send me your feedbacks ! :)\n. @pik0 you don't need to update anything. Until this code is merge in the Git official repository, you have to clone my repository using git and then checkout the branch features/volumes-management. Here running make and npm start should make Kitematic popping up with the editable Volumes.\n. @marcelorodrigo as soon as my Pull Request for the Linux support is merged, I will refresh this PR and update it.\n. I tried to merge master but the code changed too much, especially the usage of props instread of state break completely my code.\nI tried anyway to make it working quickly but it will take some time ... It's always the same story when waiting before to merge PR :-)\nCode is moving too fast.\nAnyway, I'll do my best to get back on track with this feature.\n. @syardumi I haven't finished my PR as @FrenchBen selected another one which was apparently covering the need, otherwise I would have completed it.\nNow if, as you previously said, it's not really the same, you can take over of course, but it's then too bad for me :)\n. Thank you @syardumi. I'm quite busy on other stuff so you can take my work and make it working with the current master if you'd like to.\n. Hum ... sorry I'm not sure to understand the issue ... Ubuntu image is running fine with Kitematic\n\n. Ha, this explain why my linux portage is working anyway without your merge request. This would mean that since the project has switched to Grunt, your pull request is no more needed, right ?\n. My pull request is over here: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/696.\n. @kireevco no there's no workaround as far as I know. It needs to be implemented specifically as each flags you wan to specify match with a specific Docker server API attribute.\nIf you need the --device flag, then request the possibility to mount devises, but if you need another one, you should open another issue.\n. I confirm the button is missing but the handle function exists.\n. Ha ! I've found the commit 0f3300f which is adding the button again. It should solve this issue.\n. Tank you @caske33 !!\n. It's done @caske33. The only thing is as we still need to work on the packaging, I'm not touching the parts about the download and uninstall.\n. Fine for me @caske33.\n. Can you post all the commands you've run ?\nOn my Debian box, I'm running:\n$ make\n$ sudo npm start\nAnd it's working.\n. What is missing in order to merge this pull request ?\n. > no need to add features for osx/windows, I just want to get ubuntu in there and working!\nSorry I wasn't clear. I'm talking about me, developing things like the editable volumes... I'm developing on Linux, but I can't include the Linux support in the editable volumes branch, so I have to do some tricking things in order to developer under Linux and provide the feature for the official repository.\n\nThe error is more likely to be related to the missing docker daemon - When Kitematic starts (on OSX/windows) it creates a VM to allow docker to function properly, as seen in the Setup.js:\nhttps://github.com/zedtux/kitematic/blob/linux-support/src/stores/SetupStore.js#L153\nIMHO the Linux distro should do the same, although it can simply install/setup the docker daemon locally. Usually installed in /usr/local/bin since it won't be a managed package. (unless I missed where this is setup in your PR?)\n\nThe PR is not installing Docker as it has to be done using the package manager. This is quite a big job to implement as it should manage all the different Linux distribution.\nThe purpose of this PR is not to make Kitematic working on a fresh Linux box, it's about to make Kitematic working on Linux, meaning you have a step before which is to make sure Docker is running on your machine.\nBut I fully agree with you that at the end of the day, Kitematic on Linux should take care to install Docker automagically.\n. And BTW the Docker installation should be done as a dependency of the Kitematic package. There's no need for a wizard.\n. @TeckniX homebrew on OSX is a young but powerful tool developed by a guy where couple of different people are committing some formulas and all this is installed in /usr/local/Cellar/. Then using some symlinks it makes the system aware of this folder and allow you to use the tools. The Linux package managers in the other hand are fully integrated in the system (you don't maintain OSX itself with homebrew) and all the packages are following a clear guideline with people to validate and maintain security patches and so on (it's not obvious that the packaged software developer is going to patch it).\nIn addition to that, a Linux user do not work the same way than an OSX or Windows user. When a Linux user want to install something, he will always try to do <insert-your-prefered-package-manager-here> install package-name or use a tool to search for it in the package manager but not going to a website, downloading an archive and double click an installer.\nMy final point on this is also managing the dependency of docker is very simple with the Linux packages (just a reference to docker in a file) while implementing it in the code would cost a lot of time and even more after in maintenance (keep in mind that Linux distribution born every years).\n@caske33 wrote:\n\nHowever, maybe some sort of dialog box could be displayed if docker isn't installed?\n\nThis is the best approach to me. Knowing that this case would be true only for people cloning the git repo (see my explanation above) or people having stopped docker and launching Kitematic (this happened to me).\n@TeckniX wrote:\n\nMaybe this could show up where the VM error usually shows up?\n\n100% agree with you. I will do the update of that screen adding a check on the availability of docker and show the appropriate error message.\nI will also have a look at your last feedbacks.

The file components/ContainerLogs.react is imported in the routes.js file but this file doesn't exists nor in my branch, nor in the Kitematic master branch.\n. Whhoooo !! I'm so proud of this ! Amwesome ! Thank you so much @jeffdm, @FrenchBen, @mchiang0610 and @TeckniX ! :muscle: :metal:\n. You're welcome @master-lincoln and @thaJeztah  :bow:\n. And thank you for having guide me in the last moments :)\n. Thank you @caske33, I'm glade to help people.\n. @ryanleesipes the bug you found has been fixed in this commit by @jeffdm \n. @ryanleesipes @FrenchBen is working on it I believe.\n. The users will never see this tab until he intentionally enable it in the options.\nThis is a very first version, developed in 10 minutes. It will need obviously improvements like showing useful information, and allow specific actions that only developers would like to use.\nYou can see a parallel with Safari where initially you don't have the developer tools enabled, so that you cannot inspect a page. Then going to the settings, and enabling the option add the new contextual menu entry to inspect a page.\nIn my opinion, it will not confuse users, as in the case they enable the option, they do it on purpose.\n. @TeckniX I did the code review you told me. Do you see anything else ?\n. > Initial load of the 'Volumes' tab did not show the Dockerfile exposed volumes\nThis is a bug in Kitematic. I have already noticed it but didn't fixed it.\nLet say it's the first time you run Kitematic, all is fine. You create container(s) and work with. You will not have this issue.\nBut now you close Kitematic and later start it again. In this case you will miss the list of created containers, plus opening the 'Settings' > 'Volumes' will not show any entries at all.\nA workaround would be to click the 'SAVE' button and then open another tab and come back to the 'Volumes' tab.\n\nThe 'empty' folder entry cannot have its local folder modified until you've clicked the :heavy_plus_sign:\n\nI will check that.\n\nPerhaps the Local 'Change' button should auto-fill the Docker Folder input if one hasn't been defined (last folder in the path?)\n\nThis is a good idea. It could be done now or later.\n. @TeckniX you was right ! Merging master solved this issue :+1: \n. @FrenchBen I prefer to wait for the Linux support branch is merged first as I need it in order to update this branch.\n. Thank you @bebehei :)\n. Oh .. sorry @jeffdm I have just noticed your comment here ... Let me do the update.\n. As described in the wiki page Install Docker, you can add your user to the docker group so that you don't need to run Kitematic as root.\n. Well I would say that Linux is the only platform where you don't need setup. It make more sense to create a function for OSX and Windows and call it when not running a Linux box.\nAs you can see in the code: \njavascript\n        ...\n        if (util.isLinux()) {\n          ip = 'localhost';\n        } else {\n          ...\n        }\nwe just set the host attribute, that's the Linux setup.\n. And this is could be moved in the true part of the if.\nFinally, what we could, in a proactive way, is to have a function to configure Docker in a native way (Linux and soon Windows), and a second function for the non-native way (OSX and ...?).\nWhat do you think about that ?\n. Oh ! Sure ! Sorry, I had some difficulties when I did the rebase.

    "entropitor": "@zedtux I've given chmod go+rw .config/google-chrome seems to fix it. probably because the root user needs access to the chrome settings (because of sudo npm start instead of npm start)\nBut you can actually run npm start (without the google chrome permission thing) if you make sure your user can run docker. (For ubuntu: http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group, not sure if this also works on other systems)\n(by the way, thanks for your work :+1: )\n. Not sure what exec is supposed to do. It opens a terminal and soon after closes it again.\nDocker cli just opens a terminal in the location where I was when I ran npm start\n. Bash. And it seems to be running in my host computer, not in the docker machine.\n. Oh, sorry. I don't know a lot about that kind of stuff. it's gnome-terminal indeed (I'm on unity, if that helps)\n. I'm on commit 59ec6d0b0146 and I get the behaviour I described earlier. The exec doesn't always show a terminal either (maybe it closes before it can show it).\n(I'm testing this on a running nginx-hello-world image from kitematic. not sure if that's relevant)\n. I upgraded docker and exec works now. The docker cli button still gives the same behaviour though (opens terminal in host computer, not inside the container)\n. True.

It's now here, thx to @zedtux (:ok_hand:), so coud you test it out? And say if it works for you?\nBtw @zedtux do you know if it will be easy to wrap this into .deb and .rpm packages?\n. @ChristopheBoucaut Have you tried adding your user to a docker group and running kitematic as npm start (without the sudo)\n. Yeah, you can actually Ctrl+C the terminal without closing the app.\n. @zedtux I think we can acheive the .deb packages etc. by using electron-packager to package it into a directory (https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) and then using fpm to package that directory into a .deb and .rpm (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/Source:-dir)\n. @ChristopheBoucaut That's indeed what I'm referring to.\n. @FrostyX That seems like a bug with the chromium-pickle module. \n. @sanderboom In his PR, @zedtux mentioned that he only implemented the gnome-terminal emulator. Which one are you using?\n@zedtux the mentioning of \"Finder\" is when you click on a volume, I believe.\n. @bweston92 when exactly did this error happen? (what are the steps to reproduce it?)\n. Have you installed docker before installing kitematic?\n. Kitematic currently doesn't install docker itself. As this is too hard to do because of the different package managers. When a kitematic deb package is made eventually, docker will be a dependency, but for now, you'll have to install it manually.\n. :100: for @zedtux's amazing work.\n. @zedtux Maybe you should also update the readme to say that it also supports linux :)\n. @zedtux Maybe a new issue should be created so this PR can be merged already?\n. @TeckniX chrislea is an old ppa. You should probably download node from nodesource: https://nodesource.com/blog/chris-lea-joins-forces-with-nodesource\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n. @TeckniX what @zedtux is trying to say is that it shouldn't be done through the code but through the .deb, .rpm packages etc, which should have a dependency of the docker executable. \nThe packages is something that still needs work, but we'll need help from someone with experience with .deb and .rpm packages.\nIf you do this through code, you want have to check which package manager is installed, and then use the correct one. That's cubersome and shouldn't be done in code anyway. It should be in the .deb/.rpm package.\n. The problem with linux is that you have a lot more ways of installing docker. Take a look at http://docs.docker.com/installation/. Only 1 of them is windows and 1 is Mac OS X. But you've got a couple of install guides for linux based distro's. That's why, for the maintainability of the feature, I suggest NOT to implement it in the code itself. \nHowever, maybe some sort of dialog box could be displayed if docker isn't installed? (maybe with link to the page I referenced earlier) so people can install it manually?\n. Did you first do make?\n. @FrenchBen I thought the implementation of the packaging was left for another PR. So linux users can already start using the new features of kitematic. While we wait for some with experience who can set up something like that.\n. The idea would be that with a package:\n- the app would be installed, just be doing something like apt-get install kitematic (altough this would probably be in a PPA). And something similar for other popular package managers.\n- a kitematic binary is placed in an appropriate location so an user can just run kitematic from the terminal.\n- docker would be installed too (it's a dependency of the package)\n. @jeffdm Can you merge this PR as quickly as possible? Because it has been open a long time and zedtux has put a lot of work into it...\n. :heart_eyes: \nGreat work @zedtux :100: for dedication and perserverance\n:+1: :tada: :cake: \n. @zedtux I'm happy to see this merged :tada: !

Perhaps it could be useful in some cases\n. @Fahrradflucht @brunosimioni I'm sorry but I think that Ubuntu release will never run on Debian (or the other way arround) cause off different library versions on this distributions.\nBut the build process will give you the package needed, depending on the distribution you build from.\nI think it's fair enough, if you use Debian you can build Debian packages and if you use Ubuntu you can build Ubuntu packages as well.\nOff course you can always use vagrant or any virtualization technology, even a Dockerfile to to build cross-distribution packages.\n. @FrenchBen You are rigth, and I had to check before talking, and seems to be I was wrong after all.\nI built two packages, one from ubuntu and one from debian. Both using with node 4.6.0\nBoth of them install indistinctly on both operating systems. So they are actually cross Distribution compatible packages (Ubuntu/Debian).\nSeems to exist minimal differences on package size 35179928 bytes on Debian vs 35330018 on Ubuntu.\nJust dynamic tag values variation on ldd over kitematic binary. (I attach both of the outputs)\nldd_debian.txt\nldd_ubuntu.txt\nSeems to happen some sort of home loading page problem when it continuously search for remote repositories or images, but seems to be transversal because it happens exactly the same on any installation combination. I can login on my account and check my local images and containers without any problem. \n. @wbartussek fistful you will need docker and node with grunt globally installed on the C2 then download there the kitematic sources either by cloning the repository with git or downloading any of the latests source release you also will need some requirements sudo apt-get install curl git dpkg fakeroot after that you must be able to build aarch64 package with grunt release you will find installable package under dist directory\n. @wbartussek Don't be scared seems a lot but you will see it's simple. Docker you can install from Ubuntu itself sudo apt-get install docker.io you don't need latests version for that. Node I didn't explain cause you have multiple ways, but my favorite is using nvm, you can do with simple command  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.0/install.sh | bash and after you are can install any node version nvm install v4.6.0 is my recomendation, you can do this from the unprivileged user (you don't need sudo). You will also need to install grunt globally, yo can do this with npm install -g grunt-cli.\nFinally you install the requirements as I pointed and download kitematic source. You will see it's not that hard!!\n. @wbartussek I'm so sorry you are totally on true, absolutely my fault!!\nI have a serious mix-mess between docker products and architectures\nAs you pointed electron, still is not ported to arm64 (this happens often cause is still a very new arch and usually not supported still)\nEven trying to cross compiling like pointed in Github gets broke when downloading chromium content.\nOther ways I also was expecting to use kitematic was through docker-machine, seems to me better option to operate remotely over docker on ARM SoC cards, but also seems to be stuck.\nI suppose we still have to wait to see a more general use of the arch\nbut good start point could be try to recover some of the work previously done by hypriot it could be a really smart feature\n. Unfortunately the icon issue seems to be a problem on how electron-packager manages the icon file as @fradelg well pointed. I tried to add another image path but with same results\n. @FrenchBen I'am not sure is the same issue as in windows I've tried diferent files and formats and allways the same result.\nI found this in electron-packager readme that suggest different problem, but I've to check a bit more\n\"`icon` - *String*\n  \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n Linux: this option is not required, as the dock/window list icon is set via [the icon option in the BrowserWindow contructor](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.30.0/api/browser-window/#new-browserwindow-options). Setting the icon in the file manager is not currently supported.\"\nAlso the official electron documentation says:\n\"Currently png and jpeg images formats are supported. Png is recommended because of its support for transparency and lossless compression.\nOn Windows, you can also load an ico icon from file path\"\nBased on that, I've tried to export the ico file to png and use that last one on the build process. Unfortunately with same result electron icon is always showed\n. I'm sorry @nshiell I don't understand very well your question. I've used the same node installation I've always had in my laptop. In this moment v6.1.0 but I understand other versions will work as well.\nIf you are refering to about shell:linux_npm that's necesary to load the node libraries Kitematic uses. \n. @FrenchBen Got it!! after debugging a bit. The problem was that the icon must be defined on electron-installer-debian task. Anyway, I still had to export the ico file to png because according  with the electron documentation this is the linux recommended format.\n. @FrenchBen I squashed everything in a single commit and used \"git commit -s\" to sign, I hope everything is fine now.\n. @nshiell My test on ia32 arch I did on Debian 8 with node v4.2.2 and despite some deprecation warnings generated and installable and functional package, hope it helps!!\n. @FrenchBen I think we can use electron-installer-redhat similar as what I did, this time to generate centos/redhat rpm\n. @FrenchBen Squashed again to guarantee pull request is signed (sorry for that!, tried my best as newie)\nJust added RPM support, couldn't try for ia32 arch yet, but I think should work fine\nAnd renewed pull request comment to be more operational and helpful for testing \n. Avec plaisir!!\n. I didn't realise about that. Actually the quickest way to do what you say is to add electro-packager in macosx custom task. I'm not close to my laptop at this moment but when I arrive home I can push it for you.\nOn the other hand I don't understand very well how you can build for windows and Linux from mac, are you using docker for that?\n. This triggers Linux binary build from OSX custom task. If packaging is also needed, it would be necessary to add additional 'electron-installer-debian:linux64' or 'electron-installer-debian:linux32' task at the end. I also revised the : as you pointed on your note and the absent space from the inline note. Finally squashed and signed\nHope this helps, I'm sorry I have no way to test it.\nI understand mono as the way to build the win version, never tried but smart way \nSo, can you build for Linux from OSX also? seems awesome didn't know that, Do you use additional gnu build software for that?\n. @FrenchBen Now I've seen your conversation with jhipster people, so I understand why multi platform packaging is needed from OSX, for release purposes I presuppose\nIf you can confirm me, that electron-packager works fine and generates functional Linux binary launched from OSX, the only problem I see for that is the PR line 272, but if you can bypass that in any way, there wouldn't be any problem to generate deb package  with electron-installer-debian:linux64  and even rpm package with electron-installer-redhat:linux64\n. That's because despite the name of the task electron-packager it just build the binary, and after you have to package it with electron-installer-debian or electron-installer-redhat\nAbout the OSX specific build platform arch problem, that's why I was talking about PR line 272 \n\"platform: process.platform\".\nI think I can add something like\nosxlnx: {\n   options: {\n          platform: 'linux',\n          arch: 'x64'\n          ...\n   }\n}\non electron-packager task, and call something like .... electron-packager:osxlnx from the OSX custom task. Today you have it\n. This must do the job!\nadded packaging (debian 64) and better legibility for linux distribution conditional\n. I've installed the deb package without problem:\nalbert@M11xR3:~/Descargas/Code/pull_request/kitematic$ sudo dpkg -i /home/albert/Descargas/Kitematic.deb \nSeleccionando el paquete kitematic previamente no seleccionado.\n(Leyendo la base de datos ... 519221 ficheros o directorios instalados actualmente.)\nPreparando para desempaquetar .../albert/Descargas/Kitematic.deb ...\nDesempaquetando kitematic (0.10.2-1) ...\nConfigurando kitematic (0.10.2-1) ...\nProcesando disparadores para bamfdaemon (0.5.3~bzr0+16.04.20160415-0ubuntu1) ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nProcesando disparadores para desktop-file-utils (0.22-1ubuntu5) ...\nProcesando disparadores para gnome-menus (3.13.3-6ubuntu3) ...\nProcesando disparadores para mime-support (3.59ubuntu1) ...\nAnd Kitematic works as expected\nI included dpkg and fakeroot as requisites on the PR comment, even that they can be included in debian/ubuntu just out of the box, but it will be more clear\nI also used Sublime eslint plugin to check the code, it's a really helpful tool, thanks for the nice tip, I didn't realise while I was coding, and it will help me a lot with better syntax practices (have to work this kind of distractions)\n. Hi @nshiell, I've observed that and also the description that apears on a generated package is extracted from package.json and makes reference to MacOSX. Seems that the initial development of the tool was mainly focused on that OS\nAre you saying that titlebar control buttons are static images showed by css? \nIt's a bit deceiving I thougt electron could manage better window manager integration\n. I've understood better now your question about node v4.2.2, you were referring to that early Linux support link. Actually, I'm using nvm so if you need me to verify the packaging for a determined node version it will be easy for me\n. @FrenchBen agree with that aswell, I've seen @Bigguy34 work as you pointed and it's a more ambitious aproximation, I like it, but I see the complexity it implies and just think it will take some time.\n@nshiell I dont have too much css experience, but I think I can learn on the way so if you find I can help for testing or whatever on that PR, feel free! I'd be pleased\n. I think the problem is that the package could be zipped in some point during the release process\n```\nfile dist/Kitematic_0.10.4_amd64.deb \ndist/Kitematic_0.10.4_amd64.deb: Debian binary package (format 2.0)\nfile ~/Descargas/Kitematic-0.10.5-Ubuntu.deb \n/home/albert/Descargas/Kitematic-0.10.5-Ubuntu.deb: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract\n```\n. Seems to be as easy as to change .deb extension to .zip during release process, actual file ext can cause confusion\n. And I also can confirm that the correction continues generating the package as expected in Ubuntu, my fault as well, didn't think about \n. @FrenchBen @bdharris08 The difference I see is that we can clean the warnings on windows build process cause we install the packages just in case of linux or osx build is triggered. But I'm not sure if this will be more clear, because it will introduce more complexity on package dependencies\nGiven the fact that also there are some warnings on linux as well\nnpm WARN optional Skipping failed optional dependency /chokidar/fsevents:\nnpm WARN notsup Not compatible with your operating system or architecture: fsevents@1.0.12\nI think that we could leave as it is just now and assume that a multi platform build will give us different warning depending on the OS we are building from, I can not see what is the best practice in this case\nSeems to me that is not clear which is the better way to go  StackOverflow and Github\nThe recommended way seems to be, to use a gyp file, but I\u2019m not sure if this will add to much complexity\n. @FrenchBen The message @sbacic talks about, happens when installing on graphical envronment, seems that it does extra checks in this way, and finds that the package don't fullcomplish Debian policy,  but I think it's easy to fix using lowercase for the package name and changing the maintainer address, because I recall usig github Kitematic project url and probably is looking for email format\n.

Otherwise this isn't actionable at all. \n. I understand that but I don't get why. Am I wrong in thinking that 0.35.4 runs on 4.1.1?\nWhy should the test or anything run against a different version then the Electron version runs on?\n. Yeah that would be the case if this was a regular node project but since it's an Electron app it makes not much sense to track the recommended node versions.\nElectron tracks the node version that is nearest the v8 version in the used Chrome and goes through a lot of hassle to make that happen (including patching chrome I think).\nIn v.0.36.0 they upgraded to 5.1.1 and the current (1.3.5) uses node6.3.0 which maps to Chromium 52.0.2743.82 which is V8 5.2.361.43.\nIn my opinion it makes not much sense for the reason we discussed early in this thread to track node versions apart from electron. Instead the focus should be on the electron version and the node version that comes with the electron version.\nTo answer @pmario's question. The electron API is stable since 1.0.0. That means that ones Kitematic updates to a Electron >1.0 it will be much easier to track the latest version (until v2 comes along of course).\n. Please read the instructions given on https://hub.docker.com/r/dashdb/local/.\nThis image doesn't provide any public tags you have to register with IBM.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there isn't potential for Kitematic to handle such situations better I think.\n. @FrenchBen I mean not that dashdb's special case could get handled I mean the fact that it has know tags. Isn't that the reason why it technically fails? \nEdit: Forget about that I have mixed soemthing while triaging issues. The error dispalys exactly that.\n.

But if you want other package types, I bet it's on you to implement that.\nHowever... electron forge should help support more package types... so I think that would be a good update..

Right. I would assume so (didn't look at the commit message) but that seems correct.\nI think that, if one were so inclined, they could rewrite this a bit to check if terminal was already open or not and... if it was, open a new tab with the right setup and... if not, use the one tab..

What is interesting, but kind of an aside, you don't get to this code,  https://github.com/mhelmetag/kitematic/blame/master/src/components/NewContainerSearch.react.js#L265 (which should say there are no images), because there are images... just those weird dangling ones that don't get displayed.. Basically the issue is that creating an image from the command line doesn't dispatch this action. I'm not exactly sure why. Working on that. However, It's interesting to note that pulling an image from the command line does dispatch this action.\nIn other news, there technically is a refresh button.

I had a look at that problem and as far as i understand is that the FS/Volume driver of Virtualbox is causing these problems. So there will only be the option to implement something like a network share with the MacOSX host or rewrite the Virtualbox driver. I think mapping a network share CAN also cause some problems with some filesystem operations.\n. One example:\nYou have five developers using kitematic. On every kitematic runs a mongodb container. This container will have another port on every workstation. So every developer has another configuration. I thought i solved it running manually from commandline but after clicking restart in the interface the configuration was removed.\nIs it correct that the container will be dropped when clicking restart? This is a nightmare!\nEven if the ports are not editable the should not change on restart.

So does it mean that KM will just pick a random port to listen on, even\nthough a predefined one is specified in docker file? For instance, for\nJSDetox it's 3000:3000, is that ignored?\nThanks!\nOn Thu, Mar 12, 2015 at 3:00 PM, Yakov Khalinsky notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nhi @dlimanov https://github.com/dlimanov this is something I'm looking\nforward to as well.\nSeems there is already an issue logged for this #164\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/164\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/242#issuecomment-78570592.\n. I assume this is what you wanted to see: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/remnux/jsdetox/dockerfile/\nI wonder if KM doesn't translate \"sudo docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 remnux/jsdetox\" command properly? This container runs fine in Ubuntu, but not within KM for some reason, or at least I can't connect to the docker's network iface.\n. Interesting, I don't even see EXPOSE port command in REMnux version of JSDetox. Maybe I can pull it locally and modify it instead.\n. That's the thing, nothing is listed in the ports section of KM and the field is not modifiable. I'm going to try to monkey around with my own version of Lenny's docker file and see if I can make it work by adding\nEXPOSE 3000\nline to it.\n. It appears that you cannot add your own local version of a docker file and have to use the one from the docker repo, so that strategy is out of the window. I guess I'll just wait for the new version to allow you to specify your own ports.\n. Thanks Jeff! Is there a plan on a roadmap to allow KM to use local docker files to create containers? That  surely would help in this case.\n. Sorry if this is a dumb question, but where do I create a feature request?\n. I can't seem to be able \"feature\" label to this for some reason, so please see it as such.\n. \n",

I'm also interested to support a couple machines at the same time, let's say control all the machines you have defined in docker machine - a local dev machine and a few cloud machines. \n. @ev-tt, I had done more a quick hack and this will not work the same way with the current Kitematic version. \nBut we should work on it to get a more general solution to use different machine types. I'm also interested to support a couple machines at the same time, let's say control all the machines you have defined in docker machine - a local dev machine and a few cloud machines. \n. @christoth, @ev-tt, we had a small conversation at Docker yesterday about adding this feature in Kitematic. I've done the work to support it with the current version too, but it needs to be refactored to get a great integration into upstream. I'd like to see a general integration with different Docker Engines, not only for a Raspi. I think we'll work this out soon after the DockerCon, so please stay tuned...\n. @timfallmk just checked your readme and the small screencast. This looks really awesome, would love to see this merged soon. What about to use docker-machine ls to discover all locally defined Docker engines and displays this list to the user for a preselection?\nPing @jeffdm.\n. WOW, I'm really impressed! \nGreat work @domderen!\n. Just use docker-machine env dev to display the settings of your current Docker Host. Or you can use directly in your bash shell the command $(docker-machine env dev) and all settings will be done for you.\nHere is a short example:\ndocker-machine env dev\nexport DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\nexport DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/dieter/.docker/machine/machines/dev\nexport DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376\n. I just updated to Kitematic 0.6.2 and it's working fine for me on OSX. The Docker CLI button opens up a terminal window (I'm using iTerm) and I can use docker ps commands and all works as expected.\n. Ping @jeffdm, thats the issue we talked about.\n. :+1:\nAs a first step, I'd like to see a feature to retrieve all available active Docker Engines with a docker-machine ls API call. Then show this list to the user when starting Kitematic and he can choose a single Docker Engine which he'd like to control.\nThis should be an easy extension with an instant value for the users. \n.

Are you sure that isn't a typo? Also, I ran the up sub with the -d flag from the TTY initiated by Kitematic and everything started just fine but I didn't see the containers appear in Kitematic as you described.\nSome interesting thoughts though. Maybe Stacks would be more appropriate since Compose v3 is made to support Docker Cloud and supports swarming, unlike v2 and AFAIK. But then again keeping things simple until until the tool comes out of beta would be the best approach to hit a 1.0. IDK.. Thanks for the deets @psychemedia. I gotta admit I was scratching my head for a moment there. \ud83d\ude06 As for the tool I can only imagine it's extremely difficult to keep up with Docker. We've got a great base on something for the future. If the scope can be contained to something simple, and a 1.0 shipped, perhaps then it can keep pace with changes in Docker ecosystem and eventually allow more features over time. That's my .02 at least. Though your vision is indeed compelling.. FYI, some of you may find the following information useful if you're doing more than just toying around with Docker: GitHub Goes All in on Kubernetes - The New Stack. +1 for the comment above , Getting no love from the rabbit container setup , \nCannot create directory `/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia': Permission denied.\npermissions error occurring on many other containers , making most unuseable \n. Brilliant, thanks :+1: \n. Since Kitematic now uses docker-machine, don't you just need a way to be able to configure where docker-machine should launch the containers?\n. :+1:\n.

    "thaJeztah": "Similar issue in Docker Compose; https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/1215\n@spiddy also see https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/1818#issuecomment-129081511,  https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/57, https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/1597\n. Currently, it's not possible to \"disable\" a volume if an image defines one. There's work in progress to allow UNSET-ing properties. See https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8177 for more information on that.\nHowever, volumes are used deliberately in those images for a number of reasons;\n- For persistent data; volumes \"outlive\" the lifespan of a container; if the container \"dies\", the data is not lost\n- Being able to \"share\" data (ie, --volumes-from), for example to use a one-off container to initialize the data/database. And another container to actually use or run the data(base)\n- Being able to \"upgrade\" a container (stop the old database container, start a new one, using --volumes-from=old-container, and remove the old container)\n- For performance; and this is an important reason, the layered/copy-on-write filesystem in the container has a huge performance penalty for data that's changing often, which is the case with databases.\nUsing a \"regular\" volume in stead of a bind-mounted volume could solve the permissions issue. Another solution is to chown the directory/files using the uid:gid of the database user, but if VBox shared directories are used, performance and permissions can still be tricky.\n. @rmb938 :+1: alright! This put me on the \"wrong foot\";\n\nIt seems like a quick fix here is just to add the ability to disable a container's volume.\n. No problem, and no harm done! my comment may be useful for people finding this issue and are new to Docker and not familiar with all aspects of volumes :smile: \n. Instead of a data-only container, you can also use a named volume;\n\n```\ncreate a volume for the postgres data\ndocker volume create --name postgres-data\nand use that volume when starting the container\ndocker run --name some-postgres -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres\n```\n. @StefanScherer that's pretty nifty. I like the env-vars trick. Have you suggested this trick in the Machine repo? Perhaps they're interested in that part.\nAlso\n/cc @ahmetalpbalkan because I think he was working on the Chocolatey parts in Docker\n. @StefanScherer thank! Just saw it coming by in my notifications\n. I wonder if that line was added on purpose, because an existing terminal may already be running another process, and may not have the correct environment variables setup for Docker Toolbox; opening a fresh tab works around those possibilities . > Kitematic should fetch the tags before pulling and default to the first one if latest doesn't exist.\nand;\n\nIdeally the Registry API would include the most-recent tag as part of their response. This would allow us to set the 'default' as the tag provided by the registry hub.\n\nThe most recent tag may not be the most recent release of an image (e.g. :v1-legacy being pushed/built after :v2-brand-new was)\nTL;DR; I'd be very careful here; I think that asking the user to make the decision would really be the best option here, not \"automagically\" trying to decide\n. Oh, cool! Thanks @zedtux!!\n. LGTM, thanks!\n. Thanks for reporting, looking at that file; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitematic/kitematic/master/docs/index.md, it looks like thebaseurl wasn't set properly when the docs were generated.\nping @moxiegirl \n. @moxiegirl looking at this; https://github.com/docker/docs-base/blob/0f43fd98de1f91961e924f4f2b855a0e8fbd2c82/config.toml#L1 thar config file is set to localhost; is that overwritten somewhere during the release?\n. LGTM\nping @jeffdm for the merge :)\n. @jeffdm 4 minutes? I've seen worse :smile:\nThanks!\n. Looks like that repository doesn't have a :latest tag, only a :v1.0 tag; https://hub.docker.com/r/aspgems/ibm-db2/tags/\nSo this is an issue with that repository. To work around this, explicitly specify the :v1.0 tag\n. LGTM, thanks!\n. Looks like these commits are not signed off properly\n. @FrenchBen basically, each commit should be signed off. Also, the sign-off should container your real name, not your GitHub handle; see https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work\nIn the main Docker repository we also usually ask contributors to \"squash\" their commits to logical groups. Most of the time this means that a PR contains only contains a single commit. The docker documentations has a contribution guide that describes this process; see for example this page: https://docs.docker.com/project/work-issue/\nnote: I'm not a maintainer in this repository, but most repositories in the Docker project follow the same rules here.\nHope this helps! Thanks a lot for your contributions, it's really appreciated :+1: \n. Thanks Ben!\n. VT-x is a hardware setting, and on OS X automatically enabled in the firmware; my guess is that running OS X inside a VM doesn't support that?\n. think this can be closed?\n. Looks like Linux needs to be added now as well :wink: \n. /cc @jfrazelle \n. @InfiAps you'll need to contact support@docker.com for that, the maintainers of kitematic I don't have access to that, that's handled by the Docker Hub team\n. did you also try docker ps -a? the container may still exist, but \"exited\" / \"stopped\"\n. I think this is a duplicate of https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/209\n. Do you have enough disk space available in the virtual machine? That image is quite large, it's possible the VM is running out of disk space during the pull or extracting the image\n. Looks like that repository does not have an image tagged \"latest\", only :master; https://hub.docker.com/r/m5151128/docker-centos7-php7/tags/\n. If you put Kitematic (Beta) in your applications folder, can you try opening a terminal, and running;\nxattr -rc /Applications/Kitematic\\ \\(Beta\\).app\nThat solved it for me\nping @FrenchBen ^^ same issue I ran into on one computer\n. @FrenchBen I would not really recommend using that setting. Would it be possible to ship Kitematic as a .dmg? It's more \"native\", and would work around the issue with archiver\n. Yubikey?\n. I don't think there's much that can be done here; the repository you're referring to doesn't have a :latest tag; https://hub.docker.com/r/scrapinghub/cloudera-manager/tags/\nI suggest to open an issue in the issue tracker for that image; https://github.com/scrapinghub/docker-cloudera-manager\n.

Here's a guide setting up NFS support on OSX for Boot2Docker\nhttps://gist.github.com/chiedojohn/4d2cc894f53c3da1910c\nAnd here's a script doing the same for docker-machine:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mattes/4d7f435d759ca2581347\n. I found some more on this topic:\nhttps://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs\nSeems to require docker-machine version v0.3.1\n. UPDATE: I got NFS working with docker-machine-nfs for Kitematic 0.7.6 on OSX 10.10.4\nAND now experiencing 5x faster loading for Drupal's status report page, which took 20s before (without NFS) and 4s now (with NFS).\nSteps to setup NFS for your docker container\n\nRequires docker-machine version v0.3.1\n   Check your version of docker-machine so it's at v0.3.1 or higher:\n\nbash\n   docker-machine --version\nIf the version is lower than v0.3.1, install version v0.3.1 which contains a bugfix that solves this bug: https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs/issues/1\nbash\n   curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.3.1/docker-machine_darwin-amd64 > /usr/local/bin/docker-machine &&\n   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine\n2. Install docker-machine-nfs\nbash\n   sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-nfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs/master/docker-machine-nfs.sh &&\n   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-nfs\n3. Setup NFS sharing /Users to your docker-machine using docker-machine-nfs\n   - First find the name of your docker machine with: docker-machine ls\n   - If your machines name is dev: \nbash\n   docker-machine-nfs dev\n   - On newer versions of Kitematic I believe it's called docker-vm: \nbash\n   docker-machine-nfs docker-vm\nThis command will: \n\nNotice! Comment out any conflicting shares in /etc/exports with #\nNotice! If you change /etc/exports you may need to restart your docker-machine and run the following steps once again. \n   1. Modify your /etc/exports adding a line sharing /Users \n   2. Restart nfsd on your machine\n   3. Configure boot2docker with a init.d script mounting /Users using NFS on startup.\n   4. Restart boot2docker\n4. Start a container with a volume on your newly added NFS mount.\n   Here's an example using an image with ubuntu:trusty, apache, php, mysql and Drupal:\n   1. SSH into your docker-machine\n\nbash\n   docker-machine ssh dev\n   1. Start a container from timbrandin/drupal, change tim.brandin to your username and Projects/drupal/web to where you keep the source for your Drupal project.\nbash\n   docker run -d -P --name drupal -v /Users/tim.brandin/Projects/drupal/web:/var/www timbrandin/drupal\nFor future inspiration, check how Vagrant sets this up:\nhttps://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/d7eaf503298014a93e1faa8da88947bc7d32ba58/plugins/hosts/bsd/cap/nfs.rb\n.

Did you know atom also comes with a CLI? For example could one type: atom . and the get the current folder opened in a new project window, we could do that too!\n. Soo, I just realized we don't need most of these features to get a CLI for managing the docker-machine, the steps to setup docker-compose for your kitematic docker-vm is as follows:\n- Check the MACHINENAME of the Running docker-machine used by Kitematic:\n  - docker-machine ls\n- Setup the DOCKER_ environment variables (replace MACHINENAME)\n  - eval $(docker-machine env MACHINENAME)\n- Create your docker-compose.yml with container descriptions like above.\n- Start the services\n  - docker-compose up\n- Other example commands:\n  - docker-compose stop\n  - docker-compose rm\n  - docker-compose restart\nAnd all the other commands are referenced here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli/#docker-host\nBut I can still see a benefit having a Kitematic CLI just like the Atom CLI, where one can open a Kitematic window from the terminal with or without a specified path.\nWhat's your thoughts?\n. - [x] kitematic restart \u2013 Restart the container(s) defined in the Kitematicfile.\n. - [x] kitematic \u2013 Open the Kitematic application (GUI)\n- [x] kitematic open \u2013 Open the Kitematic application (GUI).\n- [x] kitematic list \u2013 Lists the status of container(s) managed in the Kitematicfile.\n. - [x] kitematic init \u2013 Create an example docker-compose.yml.\n.

Thanks for that.\nMostly just 'know' what to pull.  I hadn't realized that search wasn't implemented in the private registry.  That's unfortunate.\nI have been able to list tags for a specific image:\ncurl -k -X GET https://localhost:5000/v2/<repo_name>/tags/list\nThat doesn't give you image/repository list capabilities like you'd have on docker hub but at least it would give a way for someone to search for a specific image and create a container from it using KM.\n. For knowing about the list of available images that can be displayed on the create/new page, I'd be OK with having to search for the exact image name and having an empty list if they don't specify the image name correctly.\nNot ideal really but better than nothing I would think.  Of course checking the specified private registry to see if it responds to e.g. /v2/_catalog (Docker Trusted Registry or some third-party registry such as Quay.io or such) would be helpful.\nOur organization is actually using an Artifactory version which also serves as a docker private registry (as well as has authentication/etc).  The current version doesn't have search capabilities but it doesn't mean that they wouldn't offer it in a future release...\n. I believe what you're discussing is already asked for in issue #232.  The gating issue with that being that docker private repos do not include search functionality as does e.g DockerHub and Docker Trusted Repository, so that image repositories would not be \"discoverable.\"  Third-party registries might even have their own custom search mechanisms as well.\n. You might want to validate with @FrenchBen, who already make a PR for this feature, only to find out that at least the private registries didn't contain the search feature.  Don't really know about 3rd party ones like Quay.io, etc.\n. The PR assumed (as I did before @FrenchBen educated me) that docker private registries had the same search functionality as DockerHub.

Just a thought.\n. @felixphew This is what I've been advocating for a while. If I want to give an experimental or somehow different setup to a newbie to Docker, the easiest path would be to allow them to enter in the DOCKER_HOST and other DOCKER_* variables.\n. @FrenchBen Making the assumption that the Docker URL was properly created seems very sensible if you are using an abstraction like Joyent's Triton. Essentially they abstract an entire data center as a single docker host thereby allowing you to connect to the Docker URL. Project Bonneville from VMWare will in all likelihood be also taking a similar approach. I've also heard from the Microsoft Docker folks that they plan on using the single host abstraction as well. Also, you can imagine a scenario where in an organization someone has provisioned a very beefy box and they give access to users to provision against it using kitematic.\n\nAs for Docker Machine, we've been living in the reality for the last couple of months where all of the pull requests were rejected and that team is in the middle of refactoring to support a driver based model. However, we are still waiting to see what that model will look like. While this all gets sorted out with Docker Machine, it would be nice to have user friendly tools like Kitematic be able to support an \"advanced option\". \nRegarding the ability to ssh in or regenerate the certs - platforms like Triton handle that for you or those patterns just don't apply. For example, you don't need to ssh in because there is no VM host running.\n. ",

Progress is being tracked over here and we're moving along quite well!\n. @legal90 That's awesome! As we discussed for the project (and you can see in the timeline), we're probably going to stick to a limited set of drivers for the first \"MVP\" release in a few months, but the idea is to add support for everything machine supports eventually.\n. @dekobon Are you suggesting using the machine \"generic\" driver for that kind of input? If so, how would you like to see the UI flow for inputting that kind of endpoint?\n. @dekobon Actually the \"generic\" driver is just meant to cover platforms that machine doesn't specifically support. Since we want the process to be as easy as possible, we wouldn't necessarily encourage that right away. However, seeing that it would be relatively trivial to add a settings page for manual \"generic\" provider input, this could possibly be added to the list.\nFirst and foremost we'd like to get the specific drivers working so people can \"one click\" use them.\n. Thanks for the suggestions, I think the ideas are worth considering. Cloud providers will definitely be an option (Digital Ocean will probably be the only one supported in the first release).\n. Just a note to cover a previous problem that was cropping up. Because of consistency issues, the nodejs team has decided to keep the 0.10.x series as the default for ubuntu. When you add the repo for node you need to specify that you want the 0.12.x branch.\nIt's not the most clearly written, but the full documentation is here\n. @zedtux Here's what happens with the \"About\" dialogue when using Unity (default WM for Ubuntu).\n\n\n.

Added a quick fix for this at #837 , but I don't know Grunt from a rock, so someone else check it first!\nAfter going around in circles (because I'm an idiot), I realized this also needs a switch in app.js, or to be refactored in mentemplate.js to skip this for Linux platforms.\nSince Windows doesn't use the menu functions, it looks like this went unnoticed until now.\n.

https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/1242. I'll check it with that version.\n. Couldn't replicate the problem at the moment. I have seen that you are now using docker-machine 0.3.0-rc1, but also 0.2.0 worked.\nTo investigate first time user experience of Kitematic, I have created a Vagrantfile and use a snapshot for a faster feedback loop. The Vagrantfile could be found at https://github.com/StefanScherer/kitematic-box\n. @domderen I've played with docker-machine.exe on Windows last week. I additionally downloaded docker.exe CLI that is also pre-built on dockerproject.com.\nAssuming Chocolatey we can install VirtualBox and curl with two little steps. I have made all these steps in a good old cmd.exe shell:\ncmd\n\u03bb cinst virtualbox\n\u03bb cinst curl\nThen download docker-machine.exe and docker.exe \ncmd\n\u03bb curl -L -o docker-machine.exe https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.1.0/docker-machine_windows-amd64.exe\n\u03bb curl -L -o docker.exe https://master.dockerproject.com/windows/amd64/docker.exe\nNow create a VirtualBox dev machine:\ncmd\n\u03bb docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev\nAnd here comes my favorite for cmd.exe shells: Translate the unix'ish environments printed by docker-machine and set it as environment variables in a plain Windows shell:\ncmd\n\u03bb for /f \"tokens=2\" %i in ('docker-machine env dev') do set %i\nWe are almost up and running. But the docker.exe (nightly build) already uses protocol version 1.18, but talking to a docker host we need version 1.17 for docker 1.5.0 hosts.\nThis could be done with a little trick:\ncmd\n\u03bb sed -ibak -b docker.exe -e 's/1.18/1.17/g'\nAnd now you can do something like\n\u03bb docker logs\n\u03bb docker images\nMaybe this helps.\n. @thaJeztah thanks for the reminder. I've found docker/machine#732 and shared my experience there, too.\n. I just stumbled upon AppVeyor as a CI server for Windows in the Chocolatey project.\nPerhaps this is a useful service to build the Windows verison of Kitematic: http://www.appveyor.com\nThere is also Node.js support: http://www.appveyor.com/docs/lang/nodejs-iojs\n. @nuest Impressive! Thanks for sharing.. Thanks! :+1: \n. Any updates? In the meantime someone else has started a Chocolatey package https://chocolatey.org/packages/docker-kitematic and I showed him this PR.\n. Thanks @FrenchBen - no problem ;-)\n. Welcome @3ricGit! Practice creates masters. :-)\n. Great, you're using VirtualBox 4.3.26 on Windows. In another PR we should update from 4.3.24 to 4.3.26 on Mac as well.\n. ",

    "PharaohAsh": "Hi, tagging on to this issue:\nI've done all the above-mentioned 'fixes'.

    "jtyberg": "I hit the 99% problem too, but my problem is not specific to Kitematic.  It's the dang Cisco VPN on Mac OS X, which tends to 1) block traffic to machines it doesn't know about, and 2) not allow modifications to the routing table while it is running.  So I could see the 'dev' machine from command line and VirtualBox, but Kitematic could not finish config.  \nOnce I figured out the subnet and vboxnetX machine, this fixed me:\n1. stop Cisco vpn\n2. sudo route -nv add -net 192.168.99 -interface vboxnet4\n3. start Cisco vpn\nFrom Kitematic side, perhaps an error stating that it could not connect to the VM would be helpful.\n.

I followed this thread, and tried everything but it's still not working.\nIs there any fix somewhere? When will we be able to do a fresh install with everything working?\nThanks,\n. Ok, I'll continue on #1029.\n. Hi,\nI just wanted to tell that I've got the same troubles. @mchiang0610 asked me if I were behind a VPN or proxy, it doesn't. For information, I'm on Windows 8.1, installed the docker toolbox 1.8.2a.\nI tried to reinstall everything after deleting the \"default\" vm by Virtualbox but nothing changed.\n. @mchiang0610 Yes it is (just checked in the BIOS)\n. Thanks @arnfox. For me, it didn't work as the IP kitematic is looking for is static.\nCould you summarize how you made it working?\n. Perfect, for me too! The 1.8.2c fixed the problem after regenerating the certificates!\nThanks a lot guys :laughing: \n. I tried an openldap one (osixia/openldap) but when running the container, the folders were not created by default. Moreover, when enabling them, I had some errors due to missing config in that volumes.\nI don't know how Kitematic is written but if a Dockerfile is mandatory, maybe one should check if some volumes are available inside it, and thus, a popup would then open to ask if Kitematic must enable the volume and then create the Kitematic//volumes and then start the container mapping them.\nBut thank you for the answer, I hope it could help to improve things :)\n. Ok, thanks I understood.\nWould it be possible to first create the mapping local / container and then run the container (for the first time at least)?\nSo that the internal modifications could be saved to the host, and if we want to kill the container, we could still have a configured container for the image.\n. Ok, so this is weird:\n- when the mapping is not set, the container works properly.\n- when I enable it, if what you say ils correct, it should also work because tarting from zero. But it doesn't seems to, as the container ils broken saying that files are missing in the mounted volumes.\nWeird... :/\n. ",

The proxy has no problem with GitHub... i can use GitHub via proxy in Google Chrome and Firefox...\nMaybe an authentication problem?

On windows my solution is following:\n```\ncreate a windows batch script \"C:\\Program Files\\Docker Toolbox\\kitematic_proxy.cmd\" and insert following script and replace \"YOUR_PROXY\" with the http://host:port of your proxy\n\nset proxy=YOUR_PROXY\nSET HTTP_PROXY=%proxy%\nSET HTTPS_PROXY=%proxy%\nfor /f %%i in ('docker-machine.exe ip default') do set DOCKER_HOST=%%i\nSET NO_PROXY=%DOCKER_HOST%\nset DOCKER_HOST=tcp://%DOCKER_HOST%:2376\ncd Kitematic\nKitematic.exe\n\nBtw. if you have generally an enterpise proxy between your station and internet you also shall configure this proxy in your boot2docker vm host:\nBecause of worng keyboard layout and problems with special key in oracle virtual box native console i connected with WinScp on my docker host using DOCKER_HOST IP login user:docker and pwd:tcuser. Then edit the profile to add proxy settings:\nsudo vi /var/lib/boot2docker/profile\nPress 'i' to start editing mode\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://your.proxy.name:8080\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://your.proxy.name:8080\nPress 'escape' and then type ':x' to save and exit the file. Now retsart your vm to make proxy active\n```\n. ",

    "TeckniX": "Somehow I don't have the Kitematic folder created on mine - The 'hello-world-nginx' disk image and rethinkdb have been installed, yet I don't see where the files are saved.\n. see below\n. Same issue here, was using boot2docker and wanted to checkout the Beta of Kitematic - I'm now in the same boat as everyone else with a 'bad/old' server version:\nclient and server don't have same version (client : 1.18, server: 1.16)\n. Thanks Jeff for the tip - this worked for me :+1: \n. I just had a similar issue of the 99% - It seems that the virtualbox create command simply never returns which created a 'bad' vbox. I manually did a remove of the vbox and started kitematic again, which was then able to finish the new dev vbox creation.\nTo Cleanup:\n``` bash\nGet a list of machine and look for 'dev'\n$ docker-machine ls\nStop docker machine and remove it\n$ docker-machine stop dev\n$ docker-machine rm dev\n```\n. This is not really complete, as I keep getting some odd responsde from the registry API when requesting additional pages, but I think I'm on the right track:\nhttps://github.com/TeckniX/kitematic/tree/infinite-scrolling\n. Confirmed by logging in to the VirtualBox and issuing docker images - The old images were still present.\nUpdates needed:\n- Stop and Delete container from image when container is deleted (docker stop <container> && docker rm <container>)\n- Delete image from Virtualbox docker rmi <image_name>\n- Resize .vmdk image? It seems that it is resized during the addition of containers\nDuplicate of (https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/263)\n. Closing because it's a docker-machine related issue, not kitematic\n. How do you usually pull docker images from Dockerhub? This is more than a Kitematic issue, but should also affect your normal docker CLI\n. There should be a 'webfile' mapped to the container. You can then go into that folder to add your www files. \nSee the Kitematic site about Managing volumes\n. Please look through the issues before posting - This is a duplicate of (https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/426) and has been added to the list of features\n. That would explain it ;) - Yea the little icon was a quick photoshop deal. I wasn't sure who was responsible for the layout design. \nAs previously mentioned quite fresh on this type of build, is there an easy way to debug/log actions/events, so that I can follow clicks etc?\n. Can I just push a blank update and add as the comment my 'Signed-off-by: Joe Smith joe.smith@email.com' ?\n. Good catch - label should be centered now - Thanks!\n. Glad I could help :dancer: \n. Looks like it was a temporary error on the dockerhub - I'm getting a proper download. Can you try again?\n. Looked a bit more into the issue and it seems to be related to the Dockerfile structure:\nbash\nCMD []\nENTRYPOINT [\"/nodejs/bin/npm\", \"start\"]\nWhen creating a docker container a command is required, which is bash. \nSince you mentioned having docker installed before and if you've used this image before, how did you start it? Executing docker run -t -i google/nodejs will give you the same No command specified error.\n. This is due to an incorrect/custom Dockerfile - When a docker container is created/started, a  command is usually specified to ensure that the container starts up with the proper service/command.\nMost of the stuff it's bash, but it can also be a service like httpd, redis, etc. \nThe problem with the image that you chose, is that the maintainer create a custom script to do, which is not within docker convention. The script should be part of the Dockerfile and then called with a command such as: sh /run.sh\nMaybe in the future we can allow users to pass their own command for creation, right now it's not implemented.\n. :+1: \n. This is for the terminal into container button near the top of the app. \n. It makes sense, but would be nice to over-write it with a simple $SHELL environment under the settings, as I believe it to be the purpose. I now see the command needed in the code :tired_face: \nI've added a PR that reads the 'SHELL' environment and pushes that to the terminal container command.\nPR: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/456\n. There are quite a few rpi-raspbian projects available on dockHub - Can you provide a link to the one you used?\n. @groverz I'm not sure if I understand the issue? the IP that you see is mapped to your VM, which holds the docker containers. That IP should be static. Your site should respond to: 192.168.99.100:32786 also\n. Then you're talking about passing an extra option to docker run, not using cgroups ;) - I believe this will be an added/future enhancement\n. @Garito understood.\nFor the time being do this:\n- Open VirtualBox App (not kitematic)\n- Change the default memory of the 'dev' image to 1GB (default is the 2GB I think)\n- Save all\nYou have now limited the virtualbox image that runs your container to the 1GB ram size, which your container will not be able to go beyond\n. :+1: \n. Good idea - I'll get that going! Is there a preferred package for typeahead?\n. @mchiang0610 That's exactly what I used in my container linking pull - Redoing it all now that Kitematic has moved towards a flux-like design. :+1: #learningcurve \n. I believe that the IP will always be the same, if you look at boot2docker, they do the same thing, where the IP is always hardcoded within their install/setup.\nAs you may know, it's all done via VBox, and kitematic uses the exact same iso as boot2docker to create the VBox. The IP difference is to make sure it's not conflicting with an existing boot2docker IP.\nOnce the VBox is created there's really no reason for it to change or get a different IP.\n. I added some typeahead logic, but I noticed some bugs where a similar pendingLink (same with pendingEnv) is passed, then the view isn't being refreshed. \nI'm not sure why this is happening, and even forcing a reset of the state data with replaceState doesn't work. \nI'll let you guys decide how this should be handled. \nps: I haven't updated the kitematic version since the recent addition, is this handled on a per release?\n. Forgot to reply, but I'm going through the flux tutorials to understand the difference and be able to implement the same changes to the flux refactoring. \nI'll make sure to do a PR once I get the flux part done. \n. @jeffdm Thanks for all of the comments/notes - I'll go through them and start fixing the spacing issues and comment as needed \n. The linking should be just like the regular docker linking, so if you had a mysql DB container running and linked it to some nginx container, you would link it as such --link mysql:mysql which then shows up on inspection of the docker container. \nYour nginx env would then have something like:\nbash\nMYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT=3306\nMYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.2:3306\nMYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PROTO=tcp\nMYSQL_NAME=/hungry_einstein/mysql\nMYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.2\nMYSQL_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.2:3306\n. The advance part of it was a request from : https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/258\n. Totally fine with it, just trying to add some of the missing features as needed - Would you like me to split the PR ?\n. I'm going to close this thread and create a new PR \n. @SvenDowideit I can add some text below the Volume mapping to indicate that this will force a reboot of the container. \nWhat I'm not following is the part: 'not clear if this will enable only the one mapping, or a mapping for all volumes' - volume mapping is a 1:1 relationship, if you change the volume on your 'Mac Folder', isn't it implied that you're changing the mapping for the 'Docker Folder' associated with it?\n. Would cycling the Start/Stop button be good enough?\n. Although not perfect, I have some of that working in the 'Linking Container' branch.\nThis is done by saving the startopts settings to the localStore. Is this what you had in mind?\n. If I understand your request properly, you would like for kitematic to have a config file, allowing it to show containers from a pre-determined list/location?\nDockerhub returns results as JSON, I think it could be possible to check for a local dockerhub.json file that would indicate the available containers. The tricky part would be the mount point of the USB, since it wouldn't be a consistent mount points, the file would need to be loaded by the user. \n\"portableapps\" would be possible, although I think may involve quite a bit of work. Since bandwidth is an issue, you would need to be certain that all assets of a certain containers are on that USB, otherwise it would defeat the purpose. \n. @psychemedia Just wanted to give you a preview of what I've worked on - If this is what you had in mind, then I'll be happy to keep going for a more stable and semi-complete version of this portable app.\nYou can download the code from here:\nhttps://github.com/TeckniX/kitematic/tree/portable\nIf you look in the 'Preferences' of Kitematic, you'll see a new section labelled \"API Settings\" - If you check the box, it will look for the api.json file within the repo directory, which is at the root of the app.\nThe api.json file has the following structure:\n- landing: These are the 'recommended' apps seen on the homepage. The icon that shows next to them is currently still being pulled from the web, but can easily be added to the repo folder\n- search: This would be your search results from the docker hub, which I simply copy and pasted in. See: https://registry.hub.docker.com/v1/search?q=nginx\n- info: The details of each container is store here, similar to the search above, I simply copied and pasted the results for each docker hub result. See: https://registry.hub.docker.com/v1/repositories_info/kitematic/hello-world-nginx\nKitematic's search is dynamic, so each character will trigger a search. I've only got 'nginx' as a valid search entry within the api.json file, which means that the app will trigger some errors until you finish typing 'nginx'\n. Is this on a particular container? The logs are being displayed properly on my ghost container:\n``` logs\n\nghost@0.6.2 start /usr/src/ghost\nnode index\n\nMigrations: Up to date at version 003\nGhost is running in development... \nListening on 0.0.0.0:2368 \nUrl configured as: http://localhost:2368 \nCtrl+C to shut down\n\nghost@0.6.2 start /usr/src/ghost\nnode index\n\nMigrations: Up to date at version 003\nGhost is running in development... \nListening on 0.0.0.0:2368 \nUrl configured as: http://localhost:2368 \nCtrl+C to shut down\n```\n. @ianbytchek thanks for the good step-by-step, I now see it too. I'll start working on a fix \n. Not sure when it was added, but it looks like a hover state exists in the latest master code:\n\n. @bradbergeron-us Would you mind doing the following to help us debug it?\n- Restart the Kitematic app\n- Click on View > Toggle DevTools\n- Click on the Console tab within the DevTools\n- Copy and paste all the information from that window as a gist, or as a comment here.\nThanks!\n. :+1: \nPlease do share any issues you run across with any steps to re-create them.\n. @johncokos For reference this was documented as part of the Docker volume management:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume\nThe high-level visual is such - Docker runs within a VM, which has your /Users volume shared. Thus docker can access/mount anything within that /Users directory. \nCould it be just a high-level of files within the /Users directory? Would you mind creating an empty dir for the Dev to auto-mount and see if the same CPU levels are reached. \nFor example, create a directory called kitematic under /Users - Load VirtualBox and mount that directory /Users/kitematic. \nref: not the same setup/app, but similar issue with nodemon:\nhttps://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon/issues/46\n. @johncokos hence my recommendation of mounting the folder only in Virtualbox (not kitematic)\nUsing your example, I would change the mounted volume in Virtualbox to be /Users/project/workspaces/ instead of the more general /Users it mounts by default.\nWhat you do afterwards in Kitematic will still work as it did before, but your limiting the nodemon to all files within /Users/project/workspaces/ instead of /Users regardless of what volumes are used in kitematic (docker)\n. @johncokos Would you mind sharing the 5 commands to get a feel for what your users are usually doing?\nI'm not opposed to a startup script, but everything you've described seems to point to terminal/shell variables, in which case could be added to the .bashrc (or whatever startup file for the shell) instead of actual Kitematic startup, since none of it would work until you created a new terminal.\nMaybe the idea would be to create a .kitematicrc file (similar to bashrc) and load that too during terminal startup?\n. Couple of things to note, which makes the above confusing to me.\n1. Your vboxnet line should never change aka it's hard-coded to be 192.168.99.100\n2. Your ssh command doesn't actually ssh into the container, but rather the VirtualBox that runs docker-machine, which in-turn runs the container. \n   Creating a tunnel at that level doesn't seem useful to me, since all ports should be available. (unless this is for your remote access of the port?)\nWith all of the above in mind, you could cut-down on a lot of work/effort by enabling port-forwarding on the VirtualBox directly using the VirtualBox manager:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/122641/how-to-forward-ports-to-a-virtual-machine-and-use-it-as-a-server/\n. DUH! forgot to remove some old comments - The restart is now streamlined through the ContainerAction, instead of the direct call - let me fix it\n. Same here - Was able to download and install it without any issues and got the same error as @mchiang0610 \nService exited with error: service start failure: 501: All the given peers are not reachable (Tried to connect to each peer twice and failed) [0]\nIf you look at the docs, you'll see that the actual Mailgun/vulcand docker instructions are as follow:\n``` bash\ndownload vulcand from the trusted build\ndocker pull mailgun/vulcand:v0.8.0-beta.2\nlaunch vulcand in a container\ndocker run -p 8182:8182 -p 8181:8181 mailgun/vulcand:v0.8.0-beta.2 /go/bin/vulcand -apiInterface=0.0.0.0 --etcd=http://172.17.42.1:4001\n```\nThe etcd bit is more than likely what is failing, since Vulcand uses Etcd as a configuration backend (per their doc)\nhttps://vulcand.io/quickstart.html#quick-start\n. @victorhooi if you want to do this locally, you can open a Docker CLI window (bottom left button in Kitematic),  build your image and spin up the image from the command line. Once the container has been created, Kitematic will pick it up and display all/any information within it. \n. @numanoids @SkiftCreative There's a small issue with the actual Docker repo from which Kitematic captures info about the different containers.\nThis should be resolved soon, thanks for your patience!\n. Weird it's showing as a proper SHA256 for me..\n\n. The answer is actually found here:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume\nThe only volumes that can be mounted are under the /Users directory. \nIf you updated your config to be something like:\ndb:\n  image: mariadb\n  expose: \n   - \"3306\"\n  volumes: \n   - /Users/<path>/expressionengine/var-lib-mysql/:/var/lib/mysql\nthen it should work\n. debian and kubuntu wouldn't have the issue, since there are no VM running -  What docker file are you using? I'd like to replicate the setup and see the errors being generated. \nDid you try to set the permissions as explained in the previous SO link? If you login to the VM (not the container) can you see the files? What permissions do they have?\n. Can you show the output of:\n$PWD/containers/expressionengine/var-lib-mysql/\n. Also feel free to jump in our chat: \n. Probably not the best, but I did found somewhat of a work-around.\nThe Dockerfile used needs to be modified so that the mysql user ID matches that of your local user:\nRUN usermod -u 1000 mysql\nhttps://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/581#issuecomment-95236828\nThis allowed me to have a running container, which I logged into via the 192.168.99.100 IP\nFor reference output log:\nbash\n CHOWN /var/lib/mysql/\ntotal 109M\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 mysql staff  374 Jun  4 23:43 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 14 root  root  4.0K Jun  4 23:31 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 mysql staff 6.1K Jun  4 22:55 .DS_Store\n-rw-r-----  1 mysql staff  16K Jun  4 23:43 aria_log.00000001\n-rw-r-----  1 mysql staff   52 Jun  4 23:43 aria_log_control\n-rw-r-----  1 mysql staff  48M Jun  4 23:43 ib_logfile0\n-rw-r-----  1 mysql staff  48M Jun  4 23:35 ib_logfile1\n-rw-r-----  1 mysql staff  12M Jun  4 23:43 ibdata1\n-rw-r-----  1 mysql staff    0 Jun  4 23:35 multi-master.info\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 mysql staff 3.0K Jun  4 23:35 mysql\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 mysql staff 1.9K Jun  4 23:35 performance_schema\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] mysqld (mysqld 10.0.19-MariaDB-1~wheezy-log) starting as process 1 ...\n150604 23:43:48 [Warning] Setting lower_case_table_names=2 because file system for /var/lib/mysql/ is case insensitive\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Using mutexes to ref count buffer pool pages\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: The InnoDB memory heap is disabled\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Mutexes and rw_locks use GCC atomic builtins\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Memory barrier is not used\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Compressed tables use zlib 1.2.7\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Using Linux native AIO\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Not using CPU crc32 instructions\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Initializing buffer pool, size = 256.0M\n150604 23:43:48 [Note] InnoDB: Completed initialization of buffer pool\n150604 23:43:48 [Warning] InnoDB: Failed to set O_DIRECT on file ./ibdata1: OPEN: Invalid argument, continuing anyway.

Yup, it's the same one about uid and the way the vboxsf mounts it.\n. As a side note there's a good amount of code that could be removed from the InfiniteGrid.js, as it's not needed/used. \nOne thing that may needed some tweaking is the 'Other Result' element height - I don't have any repo within my DockerHub login, so it may look different based on that.\n. I removed the inner-wrapper so that the entire page scrolls as it did before - I did however have to pass the 'parent' component down to the InfiniteGrid child, so that I could figure out the height of it, and calculate when the lazyLoad should happen. \nMy lack of React experience shows here, as I grossly passed the entire this object - Feel free to suggest a better way of doing this :)\n. I've actually run into something similar while trying to implement 'tag selection/prompt' during creation. \nI believe the issue is that every card is creating a listener for the tagStore change, but 1 tagStore change will trigger all cards to capture the update. \nAs the number of cards grows, so does the listener, yet they all take the same action. (you can throw a debug in the update function for the ImageCard and see it being triggered over and over. \nIf you'd like to discuss an ImageCard component redesign, then I'm all about it - The listener needs to be in the parent component I believe to prevent the multi-listeners. \n. I merged this with Master and did a little bit of QA along with container linking - LGTM :+1: \n1 Issue encountered:\nMaria DB did mapped properly to port 3306\nWhen trying to change the port to 80 for nginx-php, I got a 500 error.\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Create a new container from the recommended Maria DB container, name it 'mariadb'. Assign port 3306\n- Link the mariadb container to the nginx-php container\nbash\n$ docker run -ti -P -d --name=nginx-php --link=mariadb:mariadb maxexcloo/nginx-php\n- Verify that the ENV vars are correct within the container\n- Go to Kitematic and edit the nginx-php port to '80'\n- I get the error: 'server error 500 Cannot find child for /nginx-php/nginx-php'\nps: this could just be something in docker as a similar issue/ticket was filed:\nhttps://github.com/docker/compose/issues/1304\n. @simiula you can actually use VBox to mount a different folder than the /Users - It's just the default mounted folder.\n. What are the permissions on your /usr/local/bin folder?\n. @ianbytchek Couple of questions for you:\n- How are you mounting your volume? Can you provide the output of your  docker inspect docker-haproxy\n- What do you get on timestamp for ls /docker/configuration when you make your changes and look at scenario 1. or 2. ?\n- cat and vi should be able to pickup the same file changes. I don't see a reason why one would pickup 1 file and the other another file while pointing at the same file.\n. @ianbytchek replied to you via email due to issues with the commands you've provided\n. What is the exact name of the Crate that you're trying to build?\nAs you can see https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=crate there are quite a few. \nAlso provide any screenshot/error encountered.\nThanks!\n. All updated - let me know if anything seems out of place\n. Could you share the exact volume name? This is the first time I've seen this\n. If I understand this properly, you've installed Kitematic onto /Volumes/OSX Yosemite and getting a blank page when Kitematic starts?\n. @moimael Would you mind closing this PR in favor of @zedtux 's PR https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/696 ?\n. :+1: \n. What's the log output for both of these failed containers?\n. @ronnieserr Can you open the Docker CLI and run:\ndocker ps -a\nfind the container id of the meanjs container then:\ndocker start <container_id>\nThen paste the message from the command-line here.\n. @mchiang0610 - Perhaps read the CMD directive and display it in Kitematic? if none exist, add /bin/ls ?\nI'm not sure of the best command to run which would also be always available?\n. @ronnieserr Make sure to look in under the 'Advanced' tab settings and check both 'checkboxes' as follow:\n\n. @ronnieserr If you look under the release tab: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/releases - A newer release 0.6.7 was just recently added. \nThat version has the latest patch with the 'Advanced' tab.\n. @ronnieserr if you look at the documentation, the following is explained:\nThe image assumes that your application has a file named package.json listing its dependencies and defining its start script.\nThe image you've selected may not be meant to run as you have it imagined. Read the full documentation:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/_/node/\n. Just adding the current code functionality - \nhttps://github.com/TeckniX/kitematic/tree/add-notification\n. Will need to fix this too - On-Hold till fix\n. I had botched the previous PR and had to clean it up - The new PR should only have 2 file changed.\nThe notification is triggered when the ContainerStore Error is set. This is done via a simple listener during the ComponentDidMount\n. This is a known issue and already added as a needed feature:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/572\n. Sorry Jeff - this is a complete bust on my end for the branch. Disregard this one, I'll clean up the PR.\n. @ovizii you could always re-create the nginx container and map whatever volume you'd like, but using the Kitematic 'hello-world-nginx' as @mchiang0610 advised would be the easier choice.\n. @jeffdm I concur with moving LogStore to the flux architecture, although it was a bit more involved than this quick fix and thus put on the back-burner :P \n. @santoshkulkarni you should be able to simply download the zip file from the latest release.\nCurrently https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/releases/download/v0.6.6/Kitematic-0.6.6.zip then copy the App to your Applications folder\n. @SpokeyWheeler What happens if you click on the Docker CLI button (bottom left) and type in the terminal:\ndocker pull kitematic/hello-world-nginx\nCan you copy&paste the out put of that?\n. I'll go ahead and update the verbiage and can set it as default during the createContainer\n. @specialbrand can you follow that link:\nhttps://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/kitematic/hello-world-nginx/images\nAnd show us what you see?\n. Is this from a similar session? Do you have a proxy? It looks like the ip mapping was previously different and now resolves properly - Try perhaps the image install again?\n. Yup the incorrect version was previously being displayed, where the version of the engine behind Kitematic (electron), was displayed instead of the proper Kitematic version. \n. If you pull the latest 0.7.2 release you should have Advance features that will allow you to set it to a semi-tty which should fix the issue. \n\n. @zedtux With DockerCon last week there hasn't been much time to QA your PR - I'll take a look at it today. \nThanks for your patience! \n. Can you provide your version of NPM and NODEJS - Seem I'm already getting some dependency issues. \nWe may need to provide a guide/readme for users to upgrade their version of node+npm to the latest.\n. Just to give you an idea of my steps so far from a vanilla install of 14.04 LTS\nbash\n$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\n$ sudo apt-get install nodejs\nThis may be basic stuff, but it will probably need to be added in the docs for it to boot up. \nAlso it seems that your current setup doesn't install docker? or it fails to install because of suid?\nHere are some screenshots from this recent install:\n\n\n. @zedtux in regards to this:\n\nBut I fully agree with you that at the end of the day, Kitematic on Linux should take care to install Docker automagically.\n\nI agree 100% and it's what Kitematic does on Windows/Mac - As mentioned your PR disabled this as seen at the following line:\nhttps://github.com/zedtux/kitematic/blob/linux-support/src/stores/SetupStore.js#L153\n. @caske33 I didn't envision the rpm install kitematic and see what you're saying. \nAlthough the same argument could be made with brew install kitematic (not how it's currently installed), Kitematic should still check for the appropriate docker tools and install them if missing or need to be updated for the OS it's currently running on.\nps: Obviously this is my opinion only based on how Kitematic currently works and the need to keep things homogeneous. (aka it does/checks the same thing on all platforms)\n. I would be ok with that approach, although I believe most users using Kitematic would be on an ubuntu-like system - Basically let the user know that docker needs to be installed and provide a link to that page, if we don't detect an 'ubuntu' distro?\nMaybe this could show up where the VM error usually shows up? @zedtux what do you think?\nEdit:\nThis would work for 99% of the users:\nwget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh\n.

Do use at your own risk, although the worst that can happen (I think/hope) is it will try to create a local Virtualbox with the name of your remote Docker engine. \nBackground: \n- Dev - Local Virtualbox with a couple of containers\n- Kitematic - Local Virtualbox manually created and used Kitematic to create new ghost container\n- Staging - Digital Ocean droplet manually created via docker-machine and used Kitematic to create and run new ghost container. \nWorks:\n- Docker Engine selection\n- Container create/start/stop/restart/delete\n- Container logs\nKnown issues:\n- Clicking the 'preview' link won't work (didn't look too much into it, maybe something with the host setup)\n- Mounting of volume\nI didn't try to change the Env variables but I don't see a reason for it not to work.\nFeedback is welcome :)\n. @timfallmk Absolutely - Do you have a repo location to share?\n. @thenetimp although it may look like it's part of the image, the screenshot were showing the preference page, from which you would select the machine to use, which would then refresh the entire list of containers running\n. @thenetimp although it may look like it's part of the image, the screenshot were showing the preference page, from which you would select the machine to use, which would then refresh the entire list of containers running\n.

I believe the proper workflow would be as follow:\n1. Click \"Install Docker Commands\"\n2. Click \"DOCKER CLI\"\nWe don't enforce the 'Install Docker Commands' as some already have their established copies.\nIf you're in a terminal and don't feel like having Kitematic open just to connected, you can use eval \"$(docker-machine env dev)\"\n. What version of Kitematic are you running?\nIf you look at the code:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/src/utils/DockerMachineUtil.js#L170\nKitematic looks up the Env shell - I use ZSH and always get zsh. On Ubuntu, I get a proper BASH shell too. \nMaybe your env SHELL variable isn't set properly?\n. no problem - the Terminal.app settings can be confusing at times. Could you close this issue if it is no longer valid?\n. Our of curiosity and also to replicate the issue, what's the image name that your 'hopeful_yonath' container used?\n. it's possible if you didn't give the image a name - then the md5 looking string ends up being used.\nIf I used the above link, the name below 'hopeful_yonath' would just be 'nx-trust:latest'.\n. totally understand, was easier to replicate your exact setup/build steps then creating my own (in case you did something different).\n. @Miserlou interestingly enough we do have a check in place for active/inactive accounts, see:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/src/utils/HubUtil.js#L126\nIt looks like it needs to be debugged to ensure that we can prompt the user to activate their account, if not active. \n. This doesn't seem to be specific to Kitematic, but falls more under the 'docker' request - Please refer to the docker.com website:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/\n. Could be an issue with your connection/dns, see a possible solution here:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes\nAre you logged in to the DockerHub? Did you activate/validate your email?\n. This method was added to check the status of the container linked, preventing non-running (or incorrect) containers from being used for linking. \n. A lot of scroll/lazycallback inspiration came from it, but I did remove a ton of logic, updated broken items and overall association to work for Kitematic. I don't mind adding the MIT license if needed\n. +new Date() creates a date object that is then coerced into a number (same as Date.now())  - I only have it to make sure cached response isn't seen, but could be removed, or Date.now() can be used in its place.\n. Haha, tbh I threw it in there out of coding habit and was pleased that it worked - Totally forgot regular JS doesn't like it. \n. Can you fix the indentation of your code?

It seems like the certificate issue (Which is actually a networking issue in my tests) exists on OSX also. I don't have a Mac to test with so can't narrow down the similarities.\n. It hangs for me on that part for at least 20~30 seconds then continues. I'm assuming you waited long enough for the certs to generate?\n. Hello @FrenchBen \nThanks for the reply. I have appended to the original issue hopefully providing the information you required.\n. Follow up posted, it's working now.\nThe only possible change I can think of is an update to boot2docker.iso. No other files should have changed causing a different operation. \nEdit: No commits to boot2docker/boot2docker in the last few days. Unlikely a cause.\n. Hello @FrenchBen \nI took some extra steps to attempt to reproduce the issue and succeeded.\n- Remove DockerToolbox and VirtualBox.\n- Restart my PC.\n- Delete .docker, .electron & .virtualbox user folders.\n- Delete Oracle from Program Files and any Virtualbox folders I found.\n- Rerun the original DockerToolbox installation \n  \nI did notice that Docker-Machine and VirtualBox are force checked. Does this mean they are non-optional or already installed?\n- Start Kitematic\n  \nHanging on 99% for several minutes.\ndefault image is running seemingly correctly in Virtualbox at this point.\n- Patiently waiting 10 minutes at 99% before closing Kitematic.\n- Restart Kitematic\n- Issue reproduced.\n  \nI suspect the hanging and force kill is related. I've not viewed the source for Kitematic so cannot make any accurate guesses. But does Kitematic wait for the certs files to appear? If so it could be waiting for an operation that is never completed by the VM\n. Possible related issues: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/236 https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/291 (Which have been merged in to this issue: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/1029)\n(This operation hangs for a long time I didn't wait for it to complete ).\nSuggested fix: docker-machine regenerate-certs default\nActual fix in my situation: docker-machine rm default ; docker-machine create default --driver virtualbox\nThen restarting Kitematic works fine.\n. Modified slightly I ran\ndocker-machine -D create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 2048 default > dockerkitematic.log\nThe console still contained the following output\nConverting from raw image file=\"stdin\" to file=\"C:\\Users\\Josh\\.docker\\machine\\machines\\default\\disk.vmdk\"...\nCreating dynamic image with size 20971520000 bytes (20000MB)...\ndockerkitematic.log pasted here\nGive me a few moments and I will do the reproduction steps but run the docker-machine create instead of Kitematic and post the log for that also.\n. By observation it seems even when the virtual machine is removed the certs are not cleaned up. So the new machine uses the old ones. \n.

Hey guys, may be late to the party, but a common trend I see on issues is that if the virtual image that docker is creating in virtualbox is using 50% or more of the host's memory (RAM) then VB will not allow the instance to start up. By default I see that the ISO uses 2GB and if my box has 4GB VB sees this as an issue. Upgrading to 6GB+ fixes the issue 100% of the time for me (this is for both virtual machines and physical computers).\n. I mentioned this is another thread, but I noticed that VB is actually preventing the image from running because it is using 50% or more of the host memory.\nPretty much if you computer has only 4GB of RAM and the docker image in VB needs 2GB, VB will not let you run it. Upgrading to 6GB+ does the trick, at least it did for me in all instances where I ran into this (OSX, Win7, Win8, haven't tried it on win10 yet).\n. ",

    "domderen": "Hey,\nThanks for getting back to me. That's good to know. I can prepare a pull request later on to loose Docker CLI dependency. This is the only constraint against porting it to Windows as there is no Docker CLI for Windows.\nI was able to start the application on windows and get past the SetupStore initialization, by disabling the installation of VirtualBox for now, and preparing the required VM using machine by hand. The app was able to connect it the docker in the VM using docker-machine for Windows,and query for containers.\nUnfortunately I found an issue next, when the app is trying to use react router to navigate to containers view. The error is the same as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27153166/typeerror-when-using-react-cannot-read-property-firstchild-of-undefined but the solution provided here didn't work for me. I assume this is a react issue, so I tried upgrading dependencies to newest version of react, but it caused other issues. I assume this is because there were some breaking changes in react 0.13.\nAnyway, I will try to fix the issue later on, and get the whole application running on Windows, and when that's done, I will look into porting SetupStore for Windows. It would be great if you could mention all places in the app that highly depend on the MacOS environment.\n. Wow, that is great! I was actually using git-bash to run everything so far, but it might be a good idea to port it with chocolatey in mind. I will try to run the project fully, with premade virtualbox VM, and share some working code. Next probably some branch with Windows SetupStore to have a setup for this environment.\n. Hey, thanks :) But I am still wondering if it is necessary to integrate docker.exe here, when we have docker-machine ssh command? Can anyone tell me of any added benefits?\n. Hey, this sounds reasonable. I'll have that in mind and try to prepare a version that is using docker.exe to open a docker command prompt ;)\n. Hey @jeffdm, thanks :) A little update on my side about the windows port. Main points:\nDONE\n- I recreated the deps and reset scripts for windows to install and remove external dependencies. They are written in powershell, coz my CMD skills really suck, and I am not sure if some steps could be done in CMD without at least invoking the PS commands. I was able to loose Chocolatey dependency though, which required administrator rights, so right now the whole setup can be done without admin rights.\n- I've updated the SetupStore and SetupUtil to prepare the application for windows, including the downloading and installation of VirtualBox. As mentioned before, it is done without Chocolatey, so it still might be a little shaky.\n- Updated the list of directories used by the app, to proper Windows paths, so the docker and docker-machine binaries are placed on the user's directory. This might not be the best place for them, but it is a start.\n- I noticed that docker-machine's boot2docker image, does not automatically share Users directory with the VM, so I created a workaround and invoke a VirtualBox command to do it manually during the VM initialization step in the SetupStore. This is a strange one though coz the regular boot2docker does that automatically. Maybe this is an issue to be raised in the docker-machine repo.\n- I've rewritten a bit parts of code responsible for opening URLs or drive paths, and added an extra dependency node package called \"open\" which supports different platforms out of the box, so opening links and paths should now work on all platforms.\nSo basically now it should be possible to clone the repo, install npm deps, download app deps using the PS script, start the application in development mode, have VirtualBox installed and VM initialized, and next it should be possible to create a new container with files shared from the windows host.\nAWAITS\n- File sharing and selecting directories in the app is flaky on windows, it still needs some magic to work properly. It works with the directory that is attached on container creation, but it is not possible yet, to change the default dir. Also the naming for the local directory in the container's settings should be changed, coz it is called \"Mac Folder\", so it is not really friendly for different platforms :)\n- Opening a separate terminal with docker CLI is not available yet. I haven't started working on this one, as I am not sure how to simulate the same behavior on windows, mostly because I don't fully understand what the \"terminal\" script file is doing.\n- Application deploy in gulp file, is not ready for deploying windows version. I wanted to leave it as the last piece.\n- Testing if any of my changes don't break any of the Mac functionality. Unfortunately I don't have access to Mac, so I am only testing the app on Windows, so I don't know if I didn't break anything.\n- The whole windows setup needs some proper testing. I tested it so far on Windows 7 and Windows 8, but I am sure I didn't try all possible dependencies' configurations.\nI think that's mostly it for now. If anyone is interested in this, the branch I am working on is available at: https://github.com/domderen/kitematic/tree/win_client\nI am also thinking of send a pull request with the current changes, as a separate branch here, just to let other people participate in the work. What do you guys think about it?\n. @ahmetalpbalkan I downloaded the installer you provided, and preformed a clean install of Boot2Docker. I than ran boot2docker.exe init and it downloaded this iso: https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.5.0/boot2docker.iso I am not sure if this is the newest version you had in mind?\nI later ssh'ed to the VM, and checked that the c/Users share was correctly connected there. But as I mentioned mi my previous comment, boot2docker was never an issue, it always connected the shared folder properly. The problem is with docker-machine, when I create a new VM with virtualbox driver. it says it uses the boot2docker iso as well, but it doesn't share the c/Users folder with the VM.\n@jeffdm Good to hear that, I'll prepare a pull request later on.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan I did follow your steps, and I did get 1.6 version, and I ssh'd to the boot2docker image, and I saw that the /c/Users share was there by default, as with previous versions of boot2docker image.\nBut does docker-machine uses exactly the same boot2docker image? If so, maybe there is something wrong with the virtualbox driver inside the docker machine? Coz docker-machines virtualbox VMs do not have this /c/Users share set up by default on windows.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan Hyper-V? You mean apart from VirtualBox? Coz it uses VirtualBox for sure.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan so is the virtualbox driver for docker-machine using a different version of boot2docker.iso? Coz it doesn't automatically create a shared folder on windows, and I am not sure where to raise an issue.\nAlso I saw that the newest version of Boot2Docker that you provided has the Docker CLI integrated. Where do you plan to install the Docker CLi binary by default? I guess Kitematic should try to use the same directory for storing the Docker CLI an Docker-Machine binaries.\n. Hey, the issue was solved by my friend @KamilSzot. He found out that the usage of \nhtml\n<script src=\"Main.js\"></script>\nin Index.html causes the issue. I changed the setup to be\nhtml\n<script src=\"Startup.js\"></script>\nand added new file Startup.js which has the following content\njavascript\nrequire('./Main');\nAnd now the application works as expected. I will confirm that it also works on Mac, and prepare a pull request to fix the issue.\n. Hey, I think this issue thread can be closed now, as the PR has need merged.\n. This issue was found and documented by my friend @KamilSzot here: https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1289\nThough to be honest the error message that you presented is unknown to me, I don't remember anything like that.\n. Ultimately it is an issue with Atom-Shell raised here: https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/1289 but I guess it might take them a while to fix...\n. Hmm, it looks like the test should also be fixed, to properly read VBox Version and VBox Filename from package.json. I'll try to fix it later on.\n. I've added support for opening up a terminal window on windows. It uses the CMD for that purpose and sets up the required environment variables.\n. I am glad to hear that :) I was wondering if you have any designers at the team, who could have a look at changing the app window for Windows systems to be more consistent? Or maybe Atom-Shell provides something meaningful?\n. Cool :)\n. Hey,\nI've refactored the SetupUtil and especially installation step on windows, as it didn't work correctly. Now the whole setup process should work from beginning to end as expected on windows. The complete list of changes made:\n- Added Resources module which provides paths to all files stored in the resources directory,\n- Added docker and docker-machine binary paths to Util module, to have a single place for calling those paths,\n- Added binaries directory path, to Util module, to have a single place for calling this path,\n- Added another exec command, which utilizes \"child_process\" module, and it's \"exec\" command, as the \"exec\" used right now is deprecated,\n- Refactored the Installation step in the SetupStore, and connected with that SetupUtil commands to perform copying binaries from node instead of bash commands. That way application is more cross-platform friendly,\n- Added new dependencies in form of fs-extra, fs-promise and any-promise, to allow yielding of fs commands in SetupUtil.\n- The setup process now works correctly on windows from the beginning to end.\n. @jeffdm I am a bit new to the concept of signing the commits, so you would have to guide me through it. Should I revert current commits, and push them all as one with a '-s' parameter in git?\n. @ahmetalpbalkan This squash all commits into one is a part I have never done before, I'd appreciate some help here.\n. Hey, I've done something, though I am not sure that is what you were looking for.\n. Yeah but I did manage to push a commit here with all the changes and a sign off here. Isn't that enough?\n. Now should be fine :)\n. Yeah all looks good. Does that add/remove any points from the windows client list?\n. ",

Same here. but ...\nI'm using rc3, on Win 7 X64, behind corporate firewall and proxy.\nFresh installed just now Virtual Box 5 (latest version from their website) and Kitematic RC3.\nI've double checked before running anything that I don't have any .boot2docker .docker or .VirtualBox folders in my users folder with legacy stuff in there.\nOpened VB checked Host-only networks settings, there were none.\nOnce I run Kitematic everything goes ok but it gets stuck on 99%.\nThe .docker folder is created. The VB host-only network is created ok using 192.168.99.1 for adapter and DHCP is enabled with server address 192.168.99.1. So all good here.\nThe VM is running in VB and seems to be logged in watching the preview window. Kitematic is still at 99%.\nIf I double click the VM in VB it opens the VM (doesn't start it, it's already started just shows the terminal) and it looks like this:\n\nIf I close Kitematic and open again it hangs with a white screen and doesn't do anything unless I power off the VM which will have the same result stuck at 99%. Checked the dev console of Kitematic also for errors but not sure if they are actually logged there. I couldn't see any.\nLooking at the .docker\\machine\\machines\\docker-vm\\config.json file the \"SSHPort\" is 0 not sure if this is ok. The port fwd settings in the VM for the NAT addapter is 58138, but I guess this is a random port.\nRunning C:\\Users\\{my-user}\\AppData\\Local\\Kitematic\\app-0.8.0\\resources\\resources> .\\docker-machine.exe ssh docker-vm in a powershell window returns exit status 255\nOne more thing to mention is that our local network runs on 10.x.x.x IP addresses. At home my local network runs on 192.168.x.x and I don't have any problems there, and I have the same version of Kitematic, same Virtual Box, same Windows.\nSo not sure what is wrong and what else I should test.

This conversation is pointless, this issue should be closed as most issues are solved using the latest version of Virtualbox and Toolbox.

Currently  there are lots of problems with host-mounted volumes on OS X, and from my understanding, using NFS fixes the most egregious one... Permission issues with writing to mounted volumes which breaks data persistence. Seems like a major feature which makes/breaks the entire deal with using containers in this way. \nWe finally have editable ports so this seems like the only thing left before kitematic is usable.\n. @timbrandin Hi, thanks for the guide. This is really helpful. I've just run into a snag that I'm hoping you or someone else can help out with. I receive the message that I've successfully mounted my docker machine with nfs, but I'm receiving this error with the \"mysql-server\" image from mysql(when mounting a volume):\nchown: changing ownership of '/var/lib/mysql/': Operation not permitted\nAny idea how to resolve?\n. @rwatts3 \nDid you try running the npm commands with sudo?\n.

I'm excited about Kitematic, as I think I could use it to ease how I work on side projects (PHP, Python, and eventually Node). \nSadly, I don't think there's much I can contribute to move this forward, outside of explaining my expectations as a user:\n- When I load a new container, it would ideally have a volume set up with access to that container's filesystem.\n- For specific containers, like one devoted to WordPress, I'd love it if Kitematic provided an easy way to go straight to that software's directory root \n- I want to be able to change the Volume's mapping of the Docker Folder - > Mac Folder, as I can with  hello-world-nginx.

Hi @FrenchBen, thanks for your fast anwser but I only find this section about known issues https://kitematic.com/docs/known-issues/ but nothing related to my problem. Could you be more specific? Thanks in advance\n. I've solve my problem (the first one you posted related to my Windows 10 host system) upgrading the VirtualBox manually to the 5.0.4 version. May be the Docker Toolbox should upgrade the VirtualBox version that is packing right now!\nI hope this can help to other people!\n. Ok, Finally I achieve a solution to my problem and I want it to post it here. Maybe this could help other person with the same problem. I've been facing different issues but the most important one was this: Somehow the Virtualbox installation and the VMWare Workstation installation was making the Virtualbox network configuration go wrong.\nSo, first I uninstalled the VMWare Workstation. Then I realize the latest Windows 10 build is causing that the Virtualbox Host Only adapter, is not checking the \"Virtualbox NDIS6 Bridged Networking Driver\" so the default machine cannot start properly.\nWith these two tips, I got my kitematic working!\n\n.

Ok, so we are going to address the issue and the future PR to them. And after that, we could advance with this PR and everyone is winning :) \n.

I'm trying to work it out as soon as possible and I come back with another version :).\n. I already commit the fixed for the first issue but I'm not finding any differences between the \"initial exposed port\" and the newly added exported ports to discriminate when show the \"delete icon\". I'm going to keep trying to find a way, but no luck for now.\nAnd I really don't understand the last problem. I add the port, stop the container and I see the \"PortBinding\" already there, is that the problem that you are talking about? Because I could change the value without anyproblem so I don't feel that the value is stuck.\nI want to thank you for your help and support as always :) \n. Regarding the first thing, the configuration you commented it is not the same I've been facing tonight when I tried to fix that bug. It is true that the first execution I only have the \"dockerfile ports\" in the ExposedPorts, but when I added a new port the ExposedPorts updates with this definition making impossible for now figure out a way to do this discrimination.\n. Thanks about the clue regarding the last problem I'm going to check it out! Thanks a lot!\n. I've doing several test as you commented with this result:\nIf I execute the followinng command:\ndocker run -itd --name hello1 -P -p 8888:8888 kitematic/hello-world-nginx\nand then I execute a docker inspect hello1 and I can see as exposed ports both of the ports (the one that exists in the Dockerfile and the one we are specifying in the docker run command:\n\"ExposedPorts\": {\n            \"80/tcp\": {},\n            \"8888/tcp\": {}\n        }\nAnd then if I execute docker stop hello1, and the docker inspect I get the same output as I get using the Kitematic (with the PR):\n```\n  \"PortBindings\": {\n            \"8888/tcp\": [\n                {\n                    \"HostIp\": \"\",\n                    \"HostPort\": \"8888\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },,\n```\nSo I have two conclusiones from here:\n- I cannot reproduce the issue @FrenchBen reported: \"Something else I noticed is that when adding an extra port and stopping the container, the originally exposed port-mapping is 'stuck' and will never change, when it should be released.\" \n- I have to find another way to discriminate the ports declared inside the dockerfile from the ones that you can add. I'm thinking about to recovering the image again and check against it, but I don't know if it too heavy operation, I'm going to give it a try! \nAnothing I cannot reproduce on Windows the problem @FrenchBen said: \"New error: When I hit 'save' the port list disappears until I leave the tab and goes back to it.\" When I hit save, the input text are disabled while the container is restarting and then the input text comes editable again, but for no moment the port list disapear from my watch.\n.

Hi @MylesGray, could you establish a connection with the docker host using the docker CLI options? could you paste it the output of the docker version command? Thx!\n. Are you using the Docker CLI Command inside the kitematic? It seems like you are establishing a connection without the Certificates. Could you try to use the Docker CLI command inside the Kitematic app? Thx!\n. Ok, in the information you are providing seems that you have problems to establish a connection with your docker host inside the Virtualbox. Are you behind some kind of firewall or proxy? If this is your case, you can take a look at https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes . Please, come back to us if it that's not helping you to solve your issue.\n. Hi @FrenchBen , you are right. Now, you are seeing sh,/start.sh because the Cmd parameter inside the container is an Arrays as the CMD reference says and I'm printing the array without transformation. If you prefer the transformation I could do it to see in the GUI without the comma printed and then when you save it again create the array again. \n\nI'm going to try to make this change today so you can try it out!\nOnce again, thanks a lot for your time :)\n. Hi @FrenchBen,\nI commit the fix you were talking about. As you can see in the screenshot, now it displays the correct way:\n\nThe only thing it is not worked as expected (but I thinks it's better this way) is that if you put only a command like '/bin/bash' and you save it, the current command saved, executed and the one that displays back to you its something like /bin/sh -c /bin/bash.\nBut I think it's better this way because this is the normal way to specify a command when you start a docker container.\n. Any new feedback about this PR? Thanks a milion! \n. I don't think to check the command exist inside the container would be posible. My goal with this PR is to increase the flexibility options to work with containers and try to avoid to use the CLI to do this kind of tasks that is usually when you are working with containers to override the CMD definition or to avoid an error in the Dockerfile itself. \n. I agree with you that that will be a huge improvement. Do you want to make it inside this PR or with another PR to that issue? \n. Perfect!!\n. Hi @jeffdm , But you are talking about following the same approach you can see in this PR? Like another input field to change the ENTRYPOINT? Or are you talking about any other way to do it? Like the ways we are talking about in the issue: #1260\n. I update the PR with your latest updates from the master branch. I'm also try to squash all the commits in one, but with all the merges and so on, this is the best I could do so I hope the final result its enough to advance this PR.\n. @FrenchBen I try to clean the branch but I'm not capable to remove the merge commits :(. Regarding to the other PR you talked about (#1340) I don't see any improve about the behavior of this PR. I already include the change @jeffdm  did regarding the Entrypoint. \nI also aware he have the issue opened https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1260 to think about better handling of this feature but as it seems not a lot of \"votes\" on this I think at least we (when I said we, I said you as maintainer) should go forward with this PR, but that's only IMHO. :)\nThanks a million once again.\n. I've been taking advantage that this PR is not very \"alive\" to do some improvements to it. So, please take a look at it.\nI introduce the posiblity to specify the initial command to start the container, you can see the screenshot here:\n\nI have to use another library to create the dialog because the electron API we have been used doesn't support it. I try to open an issue to the atom/electron API: https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/4134\nThis behavior is the explained below:\n- When you click on \"create\" the pop-up is showed.\n- If you leave the pop-up content as empty or 'default', the container will be created using the defaults parameters.\n- If you specify any command the container is launched with that command.\nThat's all from my side.\nFeedback?\nThx!\n. Hi @dannc , many thanks for your information. I wasn't awared that there wasn't any standard form to query or search inside a private repository. So, I guess with that information that implement a feature like the one I'm request is not a very feasible task.\n. Thx @dannc , I appreacite if @FrenchBen share his knowledge in this specifict topic but, if there was a PR why is the reason it is not included in the master version? Do you have any info about that? \n. Hi @FrenchBen, I'd like your approach and I think it could be great not only for the Windows version but for the Linux port another mates are working on. About the details you are asking for, I have to admit there is not too much information about it. They said that the code will be the same the one we have in the docker GitHub repo (you can take a look that few of the latests code are about windows modifications), you can take a look at this link but I'm sure you already know about it. (https://blog.docker.com/2015/08/tp-docker-engine-windows-server-2016/) \nAnd the people from Microsoft these days have been showing the docker daemon implementation inside the Windows Server 2016 on the DockerConEU. \n. Kitematic doesn't deal with links between container that's the job of the docker daemon itself. \n. Could be posible that you are behind any kind of firewall or proxy? If it's the case, you should try to read this documentation where it explains to you how to proceed: https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes . Please, come back to us if it that's not helping you to solve your issue.\n.

I'm thinking more like a new button like the create that exists right now to alter the default behaviour. What do you think?\n. We are not going forward with this topic. Any new ideas about that? \n. The connection you do with your browser is probably getting through your proxy but that's not happening with the Kitematic and the docker daemon themselves. Please, take a look at:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/wiki/Common-Issues-and-Fixes#proxy-issues\n. Hi @FrenchBen, It's a pleasure that you count on me on this :). Of course I'm up for it. I've been reading all the comments you guys post in that thread and please correct me if I'm wrong but the problem seems that it happens when you don't have the VM totally up & running when kitematic starts so both of the componentes get out of sync. Is it right? \nAnd your idea it is to add a docker version op to verify that connection. And, what should be the procedure?\nKitematic pauses until we can retrieve a OK version from the docker server inside the VM? Something like a exponentially sleeps with a maximun timeout? \n. Ok, I'm getting it now. I think it's a good approach. Let me think about it and next days I start doing something about it :). I'll keep you posted\n. Please @FrenchBen  take a look at the implementation. I follow your guidelines and I try it on my local laptop but the synchronization issues are very dificult to reproduce it. So, please, let me know if you see anything.\n. Hi @klousiaj, I'm glad that this fix solve your issue, that was the main idea behind :). \nI don't understand your note. You are saying that the retry 6 was recorded twice but I can't see that behaivor at the log you posted. What am I missing? \nThx once again for your help testing the branch :+1: \n. So @FrenchBen, how long we have to wait to see this merged? I'm excited so contribute to the master branch :P \n. I'd really appreciate your comment :) \n. Fixed the issues both of you comment and I squash the commits to leave one only comment.\nSorry about the style things. I don't know why the ESLint plug-in for Atom didn't warn me and about the console log I only leave it to keep the style of getting the IP that has a console log. \nSorry! \n. New on this PR? \n. Thanks @klousiaj and @dbartow for your comments. @dbartow you only have to change the PR, or if you are facing problems you can do it doing a checkour of my fork: https://github.com/alexandrev/kitematic and the branch name it is: alexandrev:issue-1355\n. why this is not merged if it it is confirmed that fix the issue? \n. I'm not sure because there is no specific work depending on the result of the function. But I think you should ask to the person who is implementing the Linux support.\n. You can do everything that you consider helpful for the project or your\nwork :). No problem on my side.\nOn Thu, Feb 4, 2016 at 10:35 PM, French Ben notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@alexandrev https://github.com/alexandrev I took the above changes as\npart of some cleanup of the linux distro - It's basically in #1442\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1442 - If you don't mind we'll\nuse that branch over this one, as it contains a lot of small fixes that\nshould make some of the linux support easier.\nIs it ok for me to close this PR in favor of the above?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/pull/1365#issuecomment-180062369.\n. The problem is not the logic or the library. All of that are working fine. The problem is the event \"close\". On MacOS X the event application:quitting is sending on app --> before:quit but on Windows is sending on mainWindows --> close. So, it seems like at that moment the \"component\" to receive the event already have been close.\n\nAs a test, I change the event from close to minimize and when I minimize the window the VM shut down. So, we only have to find the right event :) \n. Mmmmm I don't find any event that suits for this situation :(. So, I'm going to go trying to find another approach...\n. Yeah, that will be right, but we have the app:before-quit that should do\nthe trick as it does on MacOS X but for some reason don't work the same on\nWindows (maybe it is because the specific case we have in Kitematic but I'm\nnot an expert of that topic)\nI will open a issue on electron and refer this issue to see what they think\n:)\nOn Thu, Jan 21, 2016 at 8:20 PM French Ben notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI see what you mean - we would need something like before:close - Maybe\nopen an issue in the electron repo and see what they have to say?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1369#issuecomment-173680227.\n. Done! \n. Ok, I found a way to solve the issue https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1369 but I have to admit it's not a very 'pretty' solution but it has the only way I found to get it working.\n\nThe problem is this:\n- On windows you are not using the before-quit event (I don't know why, but it doesn't work the same way than on Darwin system (MacOS X) ) but the close window event. \nWhen you receive that event and send it a new event to the app.js to close the machine if the setting is checked, but there is no time to receive the event so the action is never executed. So, the idea here is to do it two times. The first time you send the event and set a Promise to execute again the close method and then it closes.\nIf you find a better idea or way to get it fixed, please, go ahead! \n. No problem. I'm here only to help you. Have a nice day\n-- Sent from my mobile phone.

Only a check to disable it? If you want I could go for it if you think this is important.. \n. I cannot reproduce this error on Windows 10.

Hi @alankent, I'm not sure if what you are saying it is right. I think the 22 port it is not used by kitematic but boot2docker, the host OS which the docker daemon is running. So, I don't think kitematic could change that setting for you. \n. Sorry @tomasmelin when you said that you run the command. Which was the procedure that involves Kitematic? Do you launch the CLI from Kitematic? \n\nWhich output do you receive when you run docker -version ? \nThx!\n. What task were you trying to accomplish? \n. IMHO I think we should allow Windows users to be able to release its own version. I think it should the idea of using multi-platform dev environment. I'll keep you posted about the PR.\n.

I'm going to try again later today and I get back to you.\n. Hi @FrenchBen . I think this change still makes sense, right? If you confirm me that, I'll do tomorrow the squash. \n. @FrenchBen  It seems it has been done, but I'm not sure it is better this way, because I'm having to add a lot of changes that I haven't done only because I have to put all together in one commit.

OK, I'm using Atom so I'm going to install the plugins you recommend and fix these problems.\n. Yeah, the folder attribute is where you stored the array with the mounted folders in the VM. You use this attribute in rc/components/ContainerSettingsVolumes.react.js line 20, and src/utils/VirtualBoxUtil.js line 76.\n. What you are comment is totally right. I think that the operation of add a new folder to the machine is not a \"normal\" activity when you are working, it is more usual an activity you do so few times when you are configuring your enviroment. So, I think recovering once when the program starts is enough, but if you think it's better another approach we can do this call when anyone is trying to change the volume.. \nI'm open to all your considerations, you are the master here :) \n. No, it's not. My first idea was to avoid the execution of the steps that was not possible to execute on Windows. But I think you're right.

Just a note about this....I start Kitematic from the CLI as starting it from any other mode defaults to the user directory and not MACHINE_STORAGE_PATH\n.

VirtualBox installation package has a tool to do that (you may need to kill running VBox items, it will warn you). boot2docker I googled how to wipe it from my system. Then I restarted. I made sure all vboxnet adapters were still gone with ifconfig. I then let kitematic do a fresh install itself. After that it worked (I do believe I had to delete the VM and retry Setup once though).\nI can now use it with my VPN on. I think because it switched local IP's for the vboxnet adapters. But, either way, it is working for me.\n. don't know. when I did my fresh install with all previous installations removed, the standard IP it used switched from the .3 to some other local IP. And it didn't have issues with my VPN.\nUnfortunately, I already switched back to boot2docker without kitematic because accessing the underlying VM became annoying, and the UI didn't seem to support advanced things I needed. (I couldn't figure out how to provide more parameters like linking containers and dns parameters... etc).\nI didn't have time to figure those things out so I just removed everything again and went back to boot2docker alone.\n. I don't have anything that helps anymore because I have a working system without kitematic. But if I try kitematic again soon (which is very likely, because I like it a lot) I will provide it.\n. Oh I will. I'm a power user that prefers a gui. But, one thing I will say, is I would love if there was a one click way to give me the docker command based on all the inputs it saves. Ultimately, I needed to go back to the prompt to do things (or put the command in jenkins or somewhere else). having it generate that for me would be very nice (once it can support all docker flags in some way)\n. Right now, being able to pass random commands like we can environment variables would be fantastic. I don't need special support for linking, just the ability to add more parameters to the run/start commands.\n. ",

I have not checked with windows yet but I think this will be ignored in windows as closing the screen will close the whole app\n. I created another pull request with a single commit so I will close this one\n. I think the problem is that kitematic would download tag latest by default and doesn't check if this tag exists or not. \nTo download it, you can switch the tag before downloading the container : \n\n\n.  Done!\n. Is somebody already working on this? I am interested to check this\n. It's more like a common Electron bug. There are options for maximize and fullscreen window but there seem to be no difference between them https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md. \nI tried adding options maximizable and fullscreenable but this won't change the behaviour. They may be available only with more recent electron version.\n. Oh I get it now, it's because we are using frame: false and implement custom mac window buttons. I will check where I can customize it.\n. @frenchben yes I have tried with normal frame and it works fine. I will then remove current buttons and check it in each platform\n. I ended up with something like this in Mac: \n\nI have yet to check in Windows and Linux.\n. It's working fine in linux as well\n\n. I just opened the PR that fixes this\n. Oh that's great!! I think they have done good job in this mentionned PR so maybe we can close this one\n. I will check the layout in Windows and PR if any change needed there. \n. I have some trouble testing this in Windows as I have no Windows computer and tried to launch it in a VM. Docker won't be installed in the VM as Windows test VMs don't have 64bit version. \nCan someone check this out for me in Windows? \n. @Bigguy34 I am OK with the idea to continue your PR which is already quite advanced and close this one\n.

    "sibprogrammer": "What is the solution or workaround for this problem?\nAfter incorrect shutdown of notebook (due to battery) I can't download any new box using kitematic.\n. There are two possible ways:\n1. List of nodes with only one active node. You can switch the active node, but you see only containers of active node. Similar behaviour is used by Docker CLI.\n2. Multiple active nodes in the same time. It's more complicated, but it's also more powerful. You see all containers that can belong to different nodes. \nOne can start by the first way, keeping second approach in mind. Kitematic should have some screen for nodes management (list + CRUD operation). Interface should have some reference which node is currently active.\n. This brings an ability to click on checkbox label instead of trying to click on checkbox itself only. In the other words \"Allocate a TTY for this container\" text also become clickable. It's a common pattern for apps, that not only the checkbox itself is clickable, but the whole label too.\n. Ok, I'll check it later today :)\n. PR has been updated.\n. bump :)\n. First of all, comparisons like \"if version < 2.9 then\" does not work at all. Moreover take a precise look at line 52 at https://github.com/docker/kitematic/commit/6c6cefecfcae4e9bd4b79d86ac52e2047cf7346d#diff-52a099fd77c70184568d6beff73aacd7R52\nI see very strange comparison operator \"\u2265\" and probably it's also a mistake. \nCalls like \"create tab with default profile\" leads to syntax errors and stops the execution immediately. \"Try..catches\" doesn't help anyhow against syntax errors.\nWhat's why I think that the author of that PR didn't check the work against iTerm 2.1\nAnyways I have an iTerm 2.1.4 and a problem with Kitematic's Exec functionality. It opens in Terminal.app instead of iTerm. \n. Yes, it's possible using \"label for=...\", but it'll be necessary to assign the IDs for input. Is it ok for you?\n. ",

I removed Kitematic, the resources from my ~/Library folder and the machine from ~/.docker. Unpacked Kitematic again. So original vm unmodified from me and I still have the same problem. \nModified the resolv.conf and then I am able to docker pull. Shouldnt this be an open bug rather than a closed support request?\n. sorry i was not clear with my post - the relative path is in the /Users dir and the symptoms are the same with $PWD/....../var-lib-mysql and with /Users//\nalso want to reaffirm that the compose with host data volumes works just fine from my debain jessie machine and my kubuntu 15.4 machine. it only fails with kitematic\n. exactly, something is off in the vm container config. I can reproduce with a docker compose file that only consists of the following:\nexpressionengine:\n  image: mariadb #(fails with mysql too)\n  expose: \n   - \"3306\"\n  volumes:\n   - $PWD/containers/expressionengine/var-lib-mysql/:/var/lib/mysql\n  environment:\n   - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root\n   - MYSQL_DATABASE=expressionengine\nPerms from SO: I do not want host mapped data volumes defined a db container. Im ok with docker-compose.yml not being portable, but I want to be as generic as possible with the containers. Once I tried it on Linux I was able to confirm Im not doing it 'wrong', but that something is broken with kitematic.\n. Thank you for helping pin down the issue. I am concerned about the lack of portability with the dependence on a specific UID. \nHow does Kitematic do the shared folders? I do not see guest additions or a mount point in the fstab. Not having much experience here, I think changing the permissions on the shared folder mount in 'dev' would be better. 'mount' shows:\nnone on /Users type vboxsf (rw, nodev, relatime)\nvboxsf require the name of the share and then the mount location right?\n. ",

    "pmsousa": "Hi,\nI have the exact same problem. My laptop has Hyper-V with several VM's due to other projects and also one with Boot2Docker in order to do some testing and demos with Docker Hub. And it works fine! At this moment, for me, uploading my Hyper-V Vm's to Azure and replacing Hyper-V for VirtualBox it's not an option...\nI was about to test Kitematic because I saw the DockerCon livefeed and it seemed really cool but got stuck due to the VirtualBox install... I understand that at this moment it might be difficult to enable the setup to detect other already installed hypervisor but at least there could/should be a setup flag (command line flag) that we could use in order to skip the VirtualBox detection and installation.\nDocker and Microsoft are building a very strong partnership and this Summer it's expected lots of new developments on that area. You should really consider this issue because it's a definitely show-stopper for lots of people.\n. ",
    "pmario": "\n@jeffdm we should definitely add a check to detect Hyper-V is enabled (if they have it, hyper-v will always be on I believe unless you manually disable it). Only one hypervisor can run at a time. What do you think? Will this work?\n\nIMO it also has to work if Hyper-V is installed and manually disabled, because it may be enabled at any time. So VB may brick the system. ... I personally don't want any software, to automatically install 3rd party software, without me acknowledging it. (I always have a look at the \"advanced install\" option, even if I click the \"easy install\" button afterwards ;)\n. A possibility (hack) to get it going: http://agup.tech/2015/08/14/hacking-at-kitematic-with-hyper-v-on-windows-10/  until PR Added ability to work with Hyper-v #1491  gets merged. \n. Hi @FrenchBen. That's not my code. It's a story told by Anurag Gupta and I posted it here, as an info for others and me, how one could hack together a working windows app for hyper-v users.  ... \n1491 is a better solution, but also has some hardcoded stuff. eg: The virtual network driver name, ..\nImo #777 \"Proposal: Add support for multiple machines\", imo would be a better option but may be the slowest one to implement. Except all the resources are thrown together and the issues are resurrected. \n------------- (rant - OT kind of)\nI'm having a look at Kitematic from time to time (every 2 month) and need to stop here.\n\nsince I can't disable VBox installation, I need to stop the install process!\nThis behaviour breaks the whole Toolbox for me. I'd like to use a windows installer, for the docker related stuff, but I simply can't, without unwanted side effects. \nFor me it seems hyper-v is a technology, you better don't bet on. Toolbox defs seem to be happy with iMacs and MS has enough to do, to catch up with the technology in general. ---- (end of rant) \n. I'm about to install dev dependencies to build Kitematic. ... slow internet :)\n@floradu88 \n\nI know I did some hardcoding, but I haven't find a way to create a virtual switch from command line yet to drop the hardcoding.\n\nHave a look here:  https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2013/10/09/use-powershell-to-create-virtual-switches/\nThere are commands to look up existing vswitches eg:  Get-VMSwitch -SwitchType External .. IMO we need internet access in order to pull images from docker hub. ...\nIf VMSwitches exist: Get-VMSwitch will get them. ... So there seem to be plenty of options to list and use existing ones. ... creating new ones seems to be simple too. As a user I would want, that the install process lets me choose the name. (but there should be a sensible default, to just hit enter :)\n. @elft3r  .. Any progress with this topic?\n@timfallmk\n\nI'm talking to @jeffdm this afternoon about what he would like to see out this. I think he might want to have a big planning session where we can get plans set. Stay tuned!\n\nAny results here?\n. Hi @jeffdm \nI'm having closer look to kitematic source atm and I think this issue should be reopened. \nDocker Toolbox install dialog asks the user if feedback is allowed. .. Having a fast look at the toolkit install code, it seems this info is only used by the installer and not by the installed programs. ....\nAs far as I can see in the Kitematic source, the program sends information to a 3rd party service, at the program startup / setup procedure. .. For me that's definitely a problem. .. It's too late, if the user can decide to opt out, after information is already sent. \nI'm replying to the closed issue, since I'm not 100% sure yet. I want to use Kitematic with hyper-v. So I'm not able at the moment to create the exact workflow. \nBut having a look at this video from Wednesday on youtube for me it seems, opting out is not possible, after information is sent already. \nIf I'm right, please reopen the issue. \n. IMO this is a bug and not an enhancement. There is code, that (should) create a menu. ... I just doesn't work. see: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/blob/master/src/app.js#L54\n. @FrenchBen Did this PR quietly die? \n. Yea. I found out already, that the whole system is heavily connected to vbox. From a programmers point of view. Way to heavy. ...\nIMO kitematic needs a plugin mechanism, where vbox handling is a plugin too. \nThis would give us (the community with different requirements) the possibility to remove the vbox battery and replace it. \nAt the moment I'm investigating to create shared folders with hyper-v and using container tech and not vbox tech.\n. Hi, I managed to get my branch working. \\o/. \n- To check if Hyper-V exists, I'm using the same command as docker-machine\n- kitematic can run in user mode. no \"run as admin needed\" .. except \"create\" (atm)\n  - user needs to be in group: Hyper-V-Administrator\n- creating the VM with docker-machine needs a workaround, because \n  - docker machine has an issue with a hard coded dependency. ... Some more testing is needed. \n  - MS seems to have one too. .... more testing needed.\n- the switch name is still hard coded, but without spaces now: DockerVirtualSwitch. No spaces simplifies the elevated command a lot. ... \n- The second possibility would be, to use the same mechanism as docker-machine. .. They use the first one they find and provide a config parameter to change it. \n  - I think we should go with this solution.  --->   What do you think?\n- IMO the switch should be created by the User. .. we should just check if one exists and point them to the right docs, how to create one. ... We don't know the users security requirements. So let them create it. \n- I'll try to publish my version tomorrow. \n. Link to #1161, IMO it seems to be useful code but forgotten.\n. ## Hard coded requirements\n- User needs to be part of the Hyper-V-Administrators group.\n  - User needs elevated rights only once: When VM is created. \n  - see: comment above point 3\n- The virtual switch needs to be named KitematicVirtualSwitch\nSetup Kitematic VSwitch\n\nOpen the Hyper-V Manager Desktop App\nIf you need Internet Access, you'll probably need to use External Network!\nsee msdn Hyper-V on Windows for more info.\n\n\nAdd user to Hyper-V-Administrators group\n\nOpen your file explorer\nright click This PC: Manage (You have to be Admin to do this !) \n\nSystem Tools: Local Users and Groups: Groups\n\n. I can't test it with VBox. So someone should definitely see if it still works :)\n. If you put your changes into a feature branch and not master, I could directly send pull requests to you. It would make testing easier too. \n. I'm digging into the code at the moment. ... There seems to be a lot of deprecated \"setup utility\" code. IMO Kitematic used to install the same dependencies as \"Docker Toolbox\". This code makes it hard to include hyper-v support. \n\nIs someone already cleaning up this code?\n. Not tested, if VBox still works :)\n. this command: $(Get-VMSwitch | where {$_.SwitchType -eq \"external\"}).name will give us an existing switch, with the right parameters. ... So hard coded names will be obsolete. \n. No. As I wrote above it only needs Hyper-V-Administrators rights. So the user needs to be in this group. If you want to use hyper-v you need to be in this group anyway, since otherwise every command needs a boring elevated popup. .... \nWith the setting described above, I could reduce the elevated dialog. It's only needed, because docker-machine.exe has a hardcoded dependency. Which IMO is a bug! see my comment at: https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1463#issuecomment-195819642 point 3\n. > By changing the hard coded 'KitematicVirtualSwitch' switch name to use my existing switch name seems to of fixed this issue. \n@pflannery thx for testing. ... \nIMO a new test needs to be made:\n- search for an external switch with $(Get-VMSwitch | where {$_.SwitchType -eq \"external\"}).name ... and just take it.\n- If no switch fits, point the user to a help page. \nWhat do you think?\n. > once I create the correct switch then it creates a hyper-v vm called 'default' (be nice to have a better name like kitematic or similar if possible)\n@FrenchBen .. I just used the same name, that's already used for VBox. But I also thought, it should be a different name eg: kitematic-default, kitematic-vm  or just kitematic as suggested\nIt would also create better CLI commands eg: docker-machine start kitematic-vm or docker-machine start kitematic\n. > awesome to have this working with hyper-v!!\nJust to be sure: There is no directory sharing atm, since hyper-v doesn't provide this function.\n. @pflannery I did remove the hard coded vSwitch name. We use the first one we find now. .. Can you test pls? ... It took me quite some time to be able to handle spaces in the name :)\nWhat's still missing is, some more config pages. .... @FrenchBen Does it make sense to go on developing, or is it just wasted time. Is there any chance, that something from this branch gets merged?\n. thx. Yea. we need a configuration page. Guessing will be always wrong :/\n. > @pmario Also looks like if you aren't running as admin and you are in the group still does not work.\nYou are right. I'm not running as admin. See the OP. I'm part of HyperVAdministrators group. \n\nI will create a fix in a few hours for this.\nCould you please take a look at the previous comment?\n\nIMO there is no real fix atm. docker-machine has a hardcoded test for admin so atm we have to activate elevated rights to satisfy docker. \nand hyper-v seems to have a problem too: https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/2989\n\nI'll have a look at your code above\n. > ```\n\nif ( stdout.toLowerCase().indexOf('InvalidOperation') === -1) {\n```\n\nimo This code won't work, since there is toLowerCase and the test string has upper case chars. \n\nI don't see the difference between your suggested code and mine. Both commands need Admin or HyperVAdmin rights to execute. ... So if we get a response, the users have the right permissions. \nAs I wrote docker-machine has a hardcoded test. So we need to start with elevated rights. That's why we need this super ugly (workaround) construction here: https://github.com/pmario/kitematic/blob/add-hyperv/src/utils/DockerMachineUtil.js#L79\n. It seems they have a new version of boot2docker. I'm testing right now.\n. @floradu88 ok. I see. \nWe could use a similar test as docker machine. .. but they use the wrong one atm :/ see: https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/b6be1b79bcb2bf7ef6f74031ed5da3e72b882b4b/drivers/hyperv/powershell.go#L72\n. @pflannery ... for me everything is broken atm. It downloads b2d-rc3 ... at least it thinks so. It checks versions and starts downloading again. ... I think this is a docker-machine problem (I'll update if possible)\n. > @FrenchBen Seems like kitematic is trying to grab a b2d release candidate which is unstable. Is there a way to prevent this from happening ?\nIt actually is docker-machine. If you try this command docker-machine.exe -D create --driver hyperv --hyperv-memory 2048 --hyperv-virtual-switch 'switchIntern' default in Admin Powershell, you'll get the same behaviour.\n. @FrenchBen \ndocker-machine.exe version 0.7.0-rc2, build 60dbecb atm.\n. docker-machine rc3 works .. or the boot2docker iso image has changed?!\n. Hi folks, \nI'm closing this PR since it is (kind of) superseded by DockerForWindows and Kitematic auto detects hyper-v now. \nhave fun!\n. @floradu88 \n\nHello, maybe next time is worth mentioning that before you spend time developing and test it. \n\nPlease tell me, how I should have known this? ... \nI still think the Kitematic / docker-machine \"multi Platform / single software approach\" has an advantage over the \"locked in\" native versions.\n\nHere's the timeline as I see it. That's my point of view and may be totally wrong, since I don't have any knowledge about the real timeline and the people involved. \nWe probably started our approach to include hyper-v into Kitematic at about the same time frame as Docker created D4W. ... D4W concepts may be several months earlier. \nJanuary\nThe \"unikernal guys\" joined docker in January \nFebruary\nDocker moved closer to alpine in February. .. which (btw) caused some confusion in the \"ubuntu camp\"\n(fast forward May 2016: those groups seem to be responsible for a big part of the implementation\nMarch\nThis PR started 14th March. \nThe first public post in the D4W discussion forum was created on 17th March.\nDocker for Mac and Windows beta was announced at the end of March. ... I did request an invitation the same day.\nApril\nApril 3rd I got my link to test the beta. D4W was far away, from what it is now. ... \nMay 9th \nThis PR got the \"postpone\" label, which for me is very close to \"no\". In the sense of: \"No\" is temporary and \"Yes\" is forever ;)\nMay 10th\nKitematic 0.10.3 is the first version that supports Docker for Widnows natively. \nYou may find a \"Docker for Windows\" link here: https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-for-windows-beta-invites/9234/6 ...  I don't know if it still works as intended.\n. @floradu88 As I did understand the comment from FrenchBen, he would pull the branch into the main repo, so it doesn't get lost. There wasn't the intention to merge it? @FrenchBen Or am I wrong here?\nI don't have the intention to pull a windows server from the web. With my internet connection it takes hours not minutes to pull it. ... I think the ubuntu base images are way to big to be convenient. I use busybox, debian or now alpine. They still need minutes to be initialized the first time. In my opinion pulling gigabytes of images is just wasted time and super boring. \n. I think, docker for Mac and Windows is a different approach. IMO it's just a tighter integration into the native OS. In the video there is not much UI. Windows users will need a lot of UI and no CLI at all! Command line freaks the hell out of us ;). \nFor windows you'll need hyper-v atm. ... Which is a good thing for me. I currently hacked kitematic to support hyper-v instead of vbox. .. You can have only one active hyper visor in windows. So if hyper-v is active vbox can't work anymore. .... but\nProbably the minority of windows users have OS versions installed, that support hyper-v. So vbox imo will always be a fast and cheap option for the masses. \nI think there is much need for a program like kitematic for beginners. You basically have a \"One click\" experience, with a fast success. It abstracts all the glitches away, which is good at the beginning. ... \nAfter a while, as you'll start to dig deeper. You'll need more fine grained control, where the CLI comes back in. .. Or a much improved (may be rewritten) future Kitematic. eg: Kitematic is english only atm. ... \n. @Bigguy34 anything to share?\n. @Bigguy34 I did test the later version and it looks good. I did merge it with my hyper-v stuff, which works great together for me :)... \nThe only thing, that didn't work was \"minify window\". imo the window menu could be skipped at all. The close Window should be the \"Exit\" command and minify is a toolbar button. Ctrl-W imo isn't a good command. Since it's too easy to hit by accident. Windows has a native Alt-F4 for this. \njust some thougts.\n. Hi @Bigguy34 .. Any news on this PR. We have gone a long way already. So I thought it wouldn't be that far to cross the finish line :) How can I help?\n. @FrenchBen \n\n@pmario another dev also took on the challenge, as seen in this PR: #1835\n\nyea, that was the trigger to ping this topic again :)\n\nNot sure which one should be kept. WDYT?\n\nI'd be happy with \"whatever works\" - menu wise. ... \nOT: I personally don't use \"maximize\" window button. There are much faster ways to do what I want.\n. @Bigguy34 \nIt seems you'r using a very old master branch? ... So ctrl-shif-t ... Terminal doesn't work. This should be fixed in master. So I don't know if this is a new issue or just because your version is based on an old master.\nFor me ctrl - m and Window: Minimize don't work.  I'm using win10pro 1607\n. For me the help menu should look like this: \n```\nHelp\n   Online Documentation ... linked to: https://docs.docker.com/kitematic/userguide/\n   Report Issue ... as is\n   Online Feedback  ... Linked to: https://forums.docker.com/c/open-source-projects/kitematic\n\nAbout\n```\nAs in general. The existing menu system may be ok for the Mac, but it feels completely wrong in windows (at least for me). ... you know windows is different ;)\n. hi. I'll test it, at soon as you push the new stuff. I think, there is a little bit too much \"branding\" going on with the windows version. ... but this can be fixed in a new PR, because it's just cosmetics :)\n.

You can have a look at the docker toolbox: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox\n. did you try it with v0.10.3 too? https://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases\n. @FrenchBen \n\ndocker-machine is not involved with Docker for Windows \n\nBut for consistency reasons it should be. I think this should be an issue somewhere.\n. you should probably use the latest one. https://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases\n. have a look at: https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis/ it states: \n\nInternet Information Services (IIS) installed in a Windows Server Core based container\n\nSo it is a windows container, that needs a windows backend. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/containers_welcome\nI'm not sure, if kitematic can handle this combination atm.\n. did you check your free hd space on the host, or inside the VM?\ndo you use kitematic with  \"docker for windows/mac\" or DockerToolbox with VirtualBox?\n. imo this function needs to return an exe file name, which is used below, to check the version\n. imo won't work: Command to get hyper-v versions is: Get-VMHostSupportedVersion\nfor me it returns: \n```\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> Get-VMHostSupportedVersion\nName                                                 Version IsDefault\n----                                                 ------- ---------\nMicrosoft Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2                 5.0     False\nMicrosoft Windows 10/Server 2016 Technical Preview 3 6.2     False\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4    7.0     True\n```\n.

So I get an error here. \nIMO we should have a single check for machineInstalled and then a second one ot check if vbox else if hyperv\n. not sure, where it is used, but I doubt /dev/ exists in windows. \n.

    "floradu88": "@pmario  @FrenchBen I look forward in forking the repository in order to change the install process(to be able to install docker without vbox), but for now I wanted to create a way so that you can use docker with hyper-v. I know I did some hardcoding, but I haven't find a way to create a virtual switch from command line yet to drop the hardcoding. Please do let me know the repository. Looking forward to make this available out of the box with hyper-v. \nAny other feedback would be very welcome.\nRegards,\nRadu\n. Thanks, will try to create it tomorrow.\n. Yes, I am trying to see if hyper-v is installed. If it is installed, then I create the machine with hyper-v. I am using the same command as for virtualbox, but with different arguments.\n. Looks good. I haven't have time to do anything in the past week. But will take a look at your branch.\n. Will add the necessary bits soon.\n. Created branch for the things above. https://github.com/floradu88/kitematic/tree/hyperv-support\n. @FrenchBen ok, will do so from now on.\n. @FrenchBen It might be :)\n. It looks like there might be an issue with this code:\nhasAdminRights: function() {\n    return util.execFile([this.command(), 'Get-VMHostSupportedVersion']).then(stdout => {\n      console.log('stdout: ', stdout);\n      // To execute the above command you'll need Admin or Hyper-V-Admin rights.\n      if ( stdout.toUpperCase().indexOf('TRUE') !== -1) {\n        return Promise.resolve(true);\n      }\n    }).catch(() => {\n      return Promise.resolve(false);\n    });\n  },\nI found a PC with Windows 10, Powershell 5.0 and Hyper-V version 6.2.\nI am suggesting this change below: \nhasAdminRights: function() {\n    return util.execFile([this.command(), 'Get-VMHost']).then(stdout => {\n      console.log('stdout: ', stdout);\n      // To execute the above command you'll need Admin or Hyper-V-Admin rights.\n      if ( stdout.toLowerCase().indexOf('InvalidOperation') === -1) {\n        return Promise.resolve(true);\n      }\n    }).catch(() => {\n      return Promise.resolve(false);\n    });\n  },\n. @pmario Also looks like if you aren't running as admin and you are in the group still does not work. I will create a fix in a few hours for this. \nCould you please take a look at the previous comment?\n. @pmario I don't have this command available \"Get-VMHostSupportedVersion\" out of the box.\n@pmario Yes that code was done without testing it. I only researched available commands that you can use.\n. @pmario Hello, maybe next time is worth mentioning that before you spend time developing and test it. Could you please also include the link to the two things you mentioned above?\nAlso maybe next time we will have feedback on features that might not be visible to the outside contributors. I did not find any mention about the above feature.\n. @pmario I am not happy about this going to be wasted time in developing something that won't be used. They could have rejected this before we starting to put time and effort into it. A lot of guys like @FrenchBen  and you were involved and everybody looked happy about this being done. But maybe I was wrong to think that. Thank you for the information! will install this new release and try to see if this works.\n. @FrenchBen I will be more than happy if this gets merged. @pmario what do you think about this?\n. @pmario Yes, pull it under the main repository.\n. @FrenchBen I am sorry to say this, but the latest docker version is not working out of the box:\n\"Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND docker.local docker.local:2375\" with hyper-v, it fails and suggests to use virtualbox. Any idea why?\nMaybe docker for windows beta is better. I am waiting to get my hands on that one. Until then, I will try to use this to work with hyper-v.\n. I will start from master and debug it to see why this is failing. Will create a pull request with fixes, if I manage to fix it.\n. ",

Looks like working better, I have other UX and docker stability issues but I will close this one\n. Moving from one Wi-Fi to another Wi-Fi I got the issue below, if I'm working on docker container that is using local resources (like parsing local files) the switching network is not creating me problems, but if I'm working with urllib and accessing files on the web, I have more issues:\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 463, in open\n    response = self._open(req, data)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 481, in _open\n    '_open', req)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 441, in _call_chain\n    result = func(*args)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 1225, in https_open\n    context=self._context, check_hostname=self._check_hostname)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 1184, in do_open\n    raise URLError(err)\nAnd another issue I got was with docker build:\nbash-3.2$ docker build -t xx/xx xx\nSending build context to Docker daemon 14.85 kB\nSending build context to Docker daemon \nStep 0 : FROM python\nPulling repository python\nGet https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/library/python/images: dial tcp: lookup index.docker.io on 10.0.2.3:53: read udp 10.0.2.3:53: i/o timeout\nbash-3.2$\n. No proxy, that I'm aware of.\nFrom the error lookup index.docker.io on 10.0.2.3:53: read udp 10.0.2.3:53: i/o timeout I assume that the network interface of the VM is still with the old 10.0.x.x address and now is no more valid with 163.185.x.x address.\nThe same Python code is working very well on my terminal interface without docker, but somehow docker VM is not updated with the change of internet address/DHCP, etc.\n. Not \"so simple\", 10.0.2.3 is a proper private network setup with NAT DNS router (in one wi-fi environment) and I agree is very close to the problem that you listed.\nI suspect that moving from coffee shop (with NAT DNS setup) to house (with NAT DNS setup) is working, but moving from coffee shop to enterprise (with public address without NAT, etc.) is creating problem for docker VM.\nReboot the VM it is solving the problem, but the solution is far to be simple (elegant) and proper (user friendly). If you can propose a better solution to solve this problem, the users will be happier.\n. I agree is very well hidden :) It is only for very advanced users, any plans to work on UX improvements for basic users?\n. I can propose 3 solutions:\n1. Make the page fresh all the time (for better UX)\n2. Add refresh in the menu (with a shortcut potentially)\n3. Add add refresh button on the page (if you start add too much buttons the UX can be difficult to digest)\n. I'm a big fan of the automation and I'm impressed how Docker is applying it for issue cleaning.\n. Docker containers listing propose very basic search and 3 basic filters.\nUse case #1:\nImagine that you are looking for smaller Python or Linux container, today is not possible for sort by size or ranking like basic file explorer like Finder, iTunes, Mail on Mac.\nUse cases #2:\nI labeled my containers and I want to filter all the containers with label \"status\" = \"final\".\nAny hidden hidden option to do this kind of container \"exploration\"?\nI hope it is more clear now.\n.

My dev environment re-builds huge caches (about 3GB each), and each new build is versioned. It's not uncommon for my team to go through several versions a day. That's on top of the 10-15GB of extra tooling we bring in through 5-7 different Dockerfiles via Docker Compose.\nWe delete all active containers and kill any images, but the artefacts left behind by switching versions all the time easily pushes us over this number. SSH'ing into the box and manually culling is arduous and doesn't always prevent the 'no space left on device' warnings.\nApplying a 20GB limit is too opinionated and arbitrary and clearly doesn't work for all users, hence this issue.\n. @FrenchBen Defaults are fine if there's an easy way to change them. Is there someone I could look for instructions? thanks.\n. @FrenchBen thanks. I understand this is VirtualBox's problem, but since Kitematic is the front-facing entry point to OS X Docker (and docker-machine in turn), it'd be nice if one of the Docker tools took ownership of the underlying boot2docker set-up / machine resizing with a simpler GUI, or at least some kind of CLI flag to abstract it.\nI think it'd go a long way to support Docker's goal of making Docker Toolbox a friendly front-end.\nSorry if I'm airing opinions in the wrong place.

",
    "wkoszek": "My understanding is that this is a different problem: Wordpress has a dependency, but Kitematic can't figure it out, so it errors out. Since Wordpress needs MySQL, on \"Create\", I'd expect Kitematic to ask me to install MySQL automatically and get these environment variables right.\nIn other words: Kitematic experience isn't complete if I have to be jumping back and forth between GUI and the command line to bootstrap it.\n. Just letting you know about my experiences: Wordpress was a random choice of something I knew has dependencies.\nI think the summary of the problem is: Kitematic just wraps Docker command line, not Docker Compose, and thus it's unaware of further needs of the container.\nWould be nice to see us wrapping and presenting Docker Compose recipes instead of raw images.\n. Talked to @FrenchBen and we discussed technical problems. Looks like there's no good way to solve this problem with Docker metadata, so I guess it makes sense to close this as \"never fix\"\n. .\n. This looks like a problem in Kitematic. If there's any requirement to get stuff set, I'd expect Kitematic to ask me to input it. Could we throw a popup so that I can configure this environment variable at container setup time (maybe after hitting \"Create\")?\nIf not, can you at least throw a warning \"footer\" with a link to documentation of the image?\n. @FrenchBen so basically you're saying you don't know upfront what to ask for? I've looked at the mysql Dockerfile and I feel like you don't have enough metadata?\nI like the car analogy :-) But to me it's like I ordered a TV and it got shipped to me, but without necessary cables.\n. We talked about adding a help screen to overcome the problems with the parameters. Similar to other issues: Docker doesn't provide enough metadata to give the UI enough feedback on what to ask for, so I guess we should close it as \"never fixed\"\n. It might be since I migrated from Boot2Docker? I had to docker-machine rm default; docker-machine rm dev, redownload everything and the new machine seems to have dynamically resized drive and it works.\n. This looks very good. Can you show the screen shot when the right tab is\nset to \"Settings\" ?\nI proposed (?) icon since the box+arrow button was already used here (Home\ntab when the container is started):\n[image: Inline image 1]\nOn Fri, Aug 21, 2015 at 11:46 AM, FrenchBen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@wkoszek https://github.com/wkoszek I believe this is what we discussed.\n[image: kite-docs]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3965324/9416387/5ba3e8d0-4813-11e5-9fe6-130f5d3c86d3.png\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/pull/965#issuecomment-133528248.\n\n\nWojciech A.

    "fmvilas": "Actually this could be included inside Advanced tab. This way the configuration is per container, behind the scenes it will set the SHELL environment variable and you can have a UI piece to configure it instead of having to explain/document.. You're right but I had to come to this issue to understand that what I needed is to add a new env var. I was suggesting to have a UI piece that sets the right env var with the right value (a list of most commonly used shell binaries and optionally a way to set a custom one). Not sure I'm explaining myself properly :smile:. Got it. It's not an easy to solve problem. I see two issues here:\n\nThe user not knowing bash (and others) are not always included in containers.\nThe user not knowing that what she has to do is to set SHELL env var.\n\nThe first one you figure out when the error happens. The second one I think could just be mitigated like this:\n[ ] Use custom shell   <- A checkbox with label\n===== <- a text input here that is enabled when you click on Use custom shell option above\nWarning: Make sure this shell is included in your container.   <- A label here.\nOnce you know the first problem you will try to find something in configuration and if you find that piece it will be easier to understand. This could be complemented with an explanation text on the environment variables section, explaining that setting SHELL var will work.\nAnother option coming to my mind is adding a dropdown to the Exec button with the option: \"Use a custom shell\" and in the dialog explain the user needs to make sure the \"custom shell\" exists in the container.\nThey are not perfect but it could give some clues to the user.\nP.S.: Sorry for the long text, hope it can help in some way \ud83d\ude0a . @FrenchBen I'll be happy to submit a PR after we agree on a solution hehe.\n\nThe checkbox for your custom shell will essentially be an ENV var, correct?\n\nYes.\n\nIf the above is true, do you now filter the ENV vars displayed in the general section?\n\nI don't understand this question. My point here was just to add an ENV var and of course it will be also visible on the ENV vars section.\n\nHow do you deal with images that define an ENV var of SHELL?\n\nThat's a good point. I'm not sure if we can have a way to know it beforehand but, if not, we can just add a message as a \"warning\" label when setting your own shell. As a first iteration is fine and then it might be improved if possible.. ",

    "Fabs": "I have VirtualBox 5.0.4, and DockerToolbox-1.8.2. At first I though it was an issue with my cloud provider, or virtualization inside virtualization.

Probably not. I am not expert on virtualization but I think two things. First a machine with 2gb ram and a single core like the default one on kitematic, do not need VTX. Some way or another, my cloud provider (xcloud) told me they are going to fix this settings for me. I will post back.\nSecond all the cloud providers I tried offered virtual box and docker. They all claimed it work. So I think maybe it's a setting/setup issue and not a can can't thing. \nThanks for the help anyway. I will keep u posted once they update me machine \n. It improved. Now Kitematic is hanging on 99% for a long time (forever as far as I can say).\nI think now that kitematic is not finding the machine IP address for some firewall or wrong configuration, but since Xcloud changed the settings for my machine, I can run the default docker virtual machine kitematic creates\n\n. Just a note for the future readers. It looks to me that KVM (Kernel) virtualisation, called sometimes paravirtualization, does not support (is not) VT-X, whereas HVM (Hardware-assisted) virtualisation is called VT-X for Intel x86 family (AMD-V for amds). \nKVM is the normal. HVM demands the host system (XEN Hypervisor for instance) to be build in a certain manner to allow special access for the virtual machine to the underlying hardware. \n. Actually @nevercast, before I was able to test your commands, I reinstalled Kitematic and everything runs fine now, besides the container errors :).\nI ended up running this cleaning script after googling for a way to cleanup kitematic https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/58\n\nThanks. Let me know if I can help with anything else. \n. No problem.\nWell it was an adventure :). I blow up ~/.docker and the /var/root/.docker (I had one there from previous experiments)\nThen I ran into this guy:\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users//.docker/machine/machines/default/ca.pem'\nI went for your solution with:\ndocker-machine regenerate-certs default\ndocker-machine rm default ; docker-machine create default --driver virtualbox\nAnd then I ran into this guy:\nMachine IP could not be fetched. Please retry the setup. If this fails please file a ticket on our GitHub repo.\nThen I did that script:\nhttps://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues/58\n(which by looking closer now does not actualy remove kitematic (luckly) because its old and does not point to the correct /Applications/Docker Folder)\nAnyway, I got it back and running:\n\n.

Aww yiss, I cracked it! It was actually a problem where Windows had somehow turned off the NDIS6 bridged driver entry for my VBox Host-only network adapter. This StackOverflow answer has the details on how to fix it:\n1. Open network center\n2. Click \"Change adapter settings\"\n3. Right click your Virtualbox host-only adapter and select Properties\n4.

On the other hand, Vagrant has access to my installed regular virtualbox with no issues, creating and deleting machines, and never saw any warnings or errors. If Vagrant can - this tool can :)  .\n. Vagrant can create new VMs, download boxes and run them (VMs of someone else), destroy boxes (delete vm). It operates all virtualbox as it needs, I never saw issues or even warnings.\nand vagrant is a simple cli tool...  your app also can be as good as vagrant with operating virtualbox. there are no reasons for end-user to start troubleshooting anything on his PC to run docker on top of virtualbox....  good luck in development =)\n. oh, I use the VMs for testing stuff, like a cluster of Consul+Vault servers, testing Chef cookbooks and recipes. A way back I was using them to test Ansible playbooks on different distros as once (centos / ubuntu), and stuff like that... \n1) yes, i ssh into them too of course :) .\nI like how vagrant quickly creates and destroys a machine, it's so cool. \n2) I never used it to serve any services externally. \n3) i don't mount stuff, usually all tests done on main volume.\nhope it helps =)\n.

Or you display any existing docker-machine instances in kitematic without creating a default one.\nAnother issue is the corporate HTTP proxy which the only way to acces resources from the internet.\nA docker-machine command that works in out environment looks like this:\ndocker-machine create \\\n    --driver virtualbox \\\n    --engine-env HTTP_PROXY=http://10.206.246.20:8080 \\\n    --engine-env HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.206.246.20:8080 \\\n    --virtualbox-hostonly-cidr \"169.254.0.20/16\" \\\n    dev\n.

    "petergdoyle": "I am yet to be convinced of the benefit of using Docker-Machine(/Boot2Docker) for OS X and this is one of those very issues. I would rather (might as well) create my own Linux VM with Virtualbox and Vagrant and start that (or just keep it running all the time) and have a real linux-docker environment as Mac OS X shell brings along its own set of inconveniences if you plan on running shell scripts and utilities that are to be compatible with both OS X and Linux (at least the distros I use) - but that is a different discussion but for references some of the differences are outlined here. I would rather not have to have two versions of my automation and execution scripts. Why OS X doesn't just support CGROUPS natively is another discussion as well; then this kluge (Docker-Machine/Boot2Docker) would be unnecessary. \nIf anyone is interested you can take a look at how to roll-your-own docker machine with Vagrant and VirtualBox - Virtualbox already got installed anyway if you got this far.

Something like this:\nmount -t vboxsf -o gid=50,uid=1000 Volumes /Volumes\nMight be nice to have a script inside the VM that would scan for the shares and add them automatically.\n. So I fooled around with VBoxManage / VBoxControl. Here's what I got so far.\nMounting all shares within guest box can be done with something like this:\nVBoxControl --nologo sharedfolder list | grep \"-\" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs -r mkdir {} && mount -t vboxsf -o gid=50,uid=1000 {} /{}\nThis works almost ok, except for 2 problems.\n1. it also creates a \"{}\" folder. If someone can help fix that, it would be great.\n2. it doesn't handle nested folders.\nThen I tried running this from host machine, but stumbled upon following:\nVBoxManage guestcontrol {599eb0ba-9800-428f-9bf3-6d05b92e0d2e} run \"which awk\"\nVBoxManage: error: The specified user was not able to logon on guest\nVBoxManage: error: Details: code VBOX_E_IPRT_ERROR (0x80bb0005), component GuestSessionWrap, interface IGuestSession, callee nsISupports\nVBoxManage: error: Context: \"WaitForArray(ComSafeArrayAsInParam(aSessionWaitFlags), 30 * 1000, &enmWaitResult)\" at line 938 of file VBoxManageGuestCtrl.cpp\nIf someone could help me fix these issues I think I would be able to make a bash script to fix automount.\nIt is also possible to get list of all shares using VBoxManage, but it doesn't change anything that much since one needs to run a command from host machine to mount them too.\n. > Are you running it inside the Boot2docker machine on the Virtualbox?\nYes, however I'm not yet sure the mount works properly. {} folder prevents from further testing\n\nmkdir -p\n\nlive and learn :)\nAny idea on how to run this within guest machine from the host?\n. So more fooling around and here's what I got.\nRun from host computer:\nfor i in $(VBoxManage list vms | grep \"\\\"default\\\"\" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs VBoxManage showvminfo --details --machinereadable | grep SharedFolderNameMachineMapping | awk -F '\"' '{print $2}'); do docker-machine ssh default \"sudo mkdir -p /$i; sudo mount -t vboxsf -o gid=50,uid=1000 $i /$i\";done\nHow this works.\nVBoxManage list vms - get list of vms in host\ngrep \"\\\"default\\\"\" | awk '{print $2}' - get uuid of \"default\"\nxargs VBoxManage showvminfo --details --machinereadable - send this uuid to VBoxManage showvminfo to get params including information about shared folders\ngrep SharedFolderNameMachineMapping - get names of shares. They should correspond to the folder paths.\nOtherwise one can use SharedFolderPathMachineMapping to get the paths and use them\nawk -F '\"' '{print $2}' - use awk to strip strings\nfor i in $(...) do ... ; done - iterate through results\ndocker-machine ssh default - connect to docker guest using docker-machine from docker toolbox\nsudo mkdir -p /$i - since docker-machine connects us as docker user, go sudo and create mountpoints. $i is a parameter from iteration\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o gid=50,uid=1000 $i /$i - mount shares named $i at /$i as docker:staff\nAnd it seems to work.\nThis can also be done from within guest with some minor changes, i.e. iterate over results of VBoxControl --nologo sharedfolder list | grep \"-\" | awk '{print $3}' and perform mkdir and mount directly within guest. \n. Sure, it's even more simple:\nfor i in $(sudo VBoxControl --nologo sharedfolder list | grep \"-\" | awk '{print $3}'); do sudo mkdir -p /$i; sudo mount -t vboxsf -o gid=50,uid=1000 $i /$i; done\nYou only need sudo in case you are connecting to guest using docker-machine ssh\nI'll submit a pull-request first thing tomorrow and post a link here.\n. Glad to help.\nOn the other hand I start thinking that we can achieve even more flexibility.\n1. Allow selecting folders regardless of whether they are shared\n2. As soon as user requests a container to be started, share and mount required folders.\n3. As soon as container stops - remove the share (or just leave it be)\nThere might be some things to keep in mind. For example data-only containers. We should check for volumes-from and mount volumes from target container as well. We should also keep a registry of folders we have mounted to handle the situations when containers use folders that nested (i.e. container1 uses /Volumes/dev, container2 uses /Volumes/dev/bla) or multiple containers can use the same folder in which case we should only remove share when all of the containers that require it are stopped (or just leave the share as it is. It will be removed after boot2docker restarts)\nIf you like this approach I can create scripts that will add shares and mounts and remove them accordingly.\n. @alexandrev there's some sort of glitch when I start kitematic for the first time (with docker machine offline). \n\nAs soon as I change settings for any of the folders, it reloads settings for other folders as well.\n\n(in my case /Users/i != ~/)\nBesides that everything seems rather usable and works as expected. If I start kitematic with docker machine online and mounts are still there from previous launch this doesn't happen.\np.s. I go offline for 2 days and there's so much new. keep it up :)\n. @alexandrev ok, now it is showing the folders, but it doesn't mount them. I have to click change on each of the paths in order to force-mount them.\n. @alexandrev Everything seems to be working now. Flexibility we've achieved is superb!\nThanks!\n. I've been using this branch on a daily basis for past few days and encountered no problems. Would love to see this in production.\n. @FrenchBen Any particular reason for this not to be merged? Anything needs to be changed?\n. @FrenchBen I believe we didn't use any hacks. On the contrary, we exploited functionality that was already there in boot2docker. Isn't Kitematic all about automation? We just automated a process of mounting volumes as user changes settings or starts new containers.\nIt's extremely flexible and by my experience brings Kitematic users to the next level without binding them to use home folders only.

Maybe Quickstart Terminal is making some assumptions about the home directory apart from what bash actually does upon completing .profile. I noticed a .docker from a few days ago in /Users/gas. My \"real\" .docker directory is elsewhere.\n. Thanks for looking at this. My two cents:\na) Most of the time, the developer will already have VirtualBox already installed, so \"advise against installing virtualbox separately\" is not going to be effective.\nb) Yes, it makes sense to \"only support vanilla setups\" (for now, anyway) but it may be smart to remove assumptions about the home directory if possible.\n.

I'm thinking of trying a re-install, as I'm down to cargo cult magic attempts at solutions. :-\\\n. Welp. That didn't work either. Also tried creating a new private image on my own (i.e. not in my organization) and have the same issue. I guess I just don't get to use Kitematic w/ anything but public images... :frowning: :frowning: \n. Just for posterity and completion's sake, I should mention here that in a Gitter session with @FrenchBen I was able to use commands in the Javascript console to pull down images that I can't retrieve with the GUI. WTF.\n. Also just tried on an older version of Kitematic I have on a personal machine (0.8.7) and still experience the same issue. The fact that all of these images are downloadable via the CLI and by running a series of expressions/commands in Javascript in the Kitematic Chromium dev tools window, but not through a simple GUI click makes this one of the strangest bugs I've seen in my career. At this point, I'd happy if it just turned out to be PEBKAC, but there's just simply not much room for configuration errors or anything like that.\n\nI'm going to pull clone the project and see if I can make any headway with a development copy.\n. Welp just repro'd error in a dev copy and decided I honestly don't have the spare time to try to grok the project and debug this on my own (I have basically zero exp w/ node, so it'd be a learning curve). \nW/e -- I'll just use the CLI to pull things down and launch them. I'm going to close this issue now and hope that it somehow gets solved in a later release. Thanks for your help to date.\n. ",

I gonna try. \nDescription\nFor years I used a setup of virtual machines based on Vagrant, VirtualBox and NFS. For a long period I even stored them on USB stick and never suffered a data loss. I also used docker containers inside VirtualBox.\nNow I was evaluating Docker-For-Mac with the official MariaDB container. To be able to throw containers away, I stored the DB on the local machine by mounting a directory, to stay on the safe side.\nAFAIK Docker-For-Mac mounts by a FUSE variant. Within one day, upon the first crash of the Mac due to an empty battery, I was unable to reconnect the DB. The mounting itself kept woking.\nIt was an evaluation database, so nothing was lost. \nA single user report doesn't give a statistic. From my point of view it's very surprising that the NFS setup is working for years, while the Docker-For-Mac crashes the DB within 24 hours upon the first occasion.\nI also experimented with FUSE ten years ago and it was quite limited compared to NFS.\nAlternatives\nI tried Dinghy to get NFS back, but it's still not mature enough.\nDocker-machine within VirtualBox would be a solution, but lacks simplicity.\nMy current choice\n\nDocker-for-Mac for the application for reasons of simplicity and connectivity with Kitematic.\nDB on the local machine via Homebrew.\n\nFor a personal machine I can't recommend to run DB in docker containers so far.

When I wiped the old version of the toolbox and re-installed from scratch, the first time I ran the quick terminal it asked if I wanted to use iTerm or Terminal. Since I prefer iTerm, I selected iTerm. Now, I can't use the Quick Terminal at all. But, I can get a terminal from Kitematic to work.\n. When I run Quickstart Terminal, it open/brings to front my iTerm with my\nnormal OhMyZsh prompt. I try a docker command and it says:\n\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this\nhost?  \nBut, when I open with Terminal from Kitematic, it works fine. Kitematic only\nlaunches with Terminal.\nRichard\n\nOn Jan 6 2016, at 1:20 am, French Ben <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:  \nForgot it does that - I just tried on mine (I use iTerm daily) and selected\nthe 'iTerm' option (not always)\na new tab was opened in my existing window and I got the docker prompt.\nClicking on 'iTerm (always)' had the exact same effect.\nDo you have any special scripts?

That line returns nothing and there isn't anything in my .zshrc regarding\nDocker.

BTW: It still doesn't work. I removed my ohmyzsh and tried to start with the QuickStart Terminal and it still doesn't work. The quickstart terminal doesn't launch doesn't start the VM at all it set for iTerm. It just brings iTerm to the forground. I'm using iTerm Build 2.9.20160105-nightly which changes how an outside process can sent command to the terminal.\n. \n",
    "snappyjig": "I was using iTerm2 3.0 (beta) and had the same issue. Switched back to latest stable release of iTerm2 (2.1.4). And it worked. (Had some unexpected error launching Quickstart Terminal first time. But launching it a second time did the trick).\n. ",
    "dbartow": "I have the same problem.  If I click Docker CLI in the lower left of Kitematic, and list my images and containers, I have many.. but none are showing up in the left hand nav in Kitematic.  If I pull new ones at the commandline, they dont show up in Kitematic.\nHowever, if I Create from within Kitematic, downloading the Mincecraft or nginx container for example.... it shows up immediately on the left.\nMac OS X 10.11.2\nKitematic:  0.9.3\nVirtualBox: 5.0.10 r104061\n. I went ahead and updated, our versions are now in sync on both fronts.  Unfortunately, no changes in behavior.\nI tried your command, and the containers start at the command line but don't register in Kitematic.  Even something like docker run kitematic/minecraft starts at the command line but doesn't seem to do anything in Kitematic.  Clicking CREATE on any container in the list in Kinematic works right away tho.\nI can see the Minecraft container I created via Kitematic in the same console at the nginx ones I did at the commandline.  Some screenshots attached just to make sure Im not doing anything wrong ;)\n\n\n\n. Thanks again for the attention on this issue @FrenchBen - bummer that we can't reproduce it easily.\nHere is my docker version output:  Client:\n Version:      1.9.1\n API version:  1.21\n Go version:   go1.4.3\n Git commit:   a34a1d5\n Built:        Fri Nov 20 17:56:04 UTC 2015\n OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64\nServer:\n Version:      1.9.1\n API version:  1.21\n Go version:   go1.4.3\n Git commit:   a34a1d5\n Built:        Fri Nov 20 17:56:04 UTC 2015\n OS/Arch:      linux/amd64\nbash-3.2$ \ndocker events did indeed show events being registered for each container instantiation\n\n. Good call - could this be something important?  IPC sounds like it could be a culprit :)\n\n. I usually leave my VM up for many days at a time.  Powering the VM down and then killing VboxNetDHCP, and firing everything back up didn't change the behavior :(\nI don't think I've changed these from their defaults:\n\n\n. @klousiaj is spot on!  I just tried what he suggested (start default in VBox, then Kitematic) and I have all containers listed in Kitematic!  Woot!\n@FrenchBen I can say for certain that if a re-sync button existed, I would click it :)  Would it be just as easy though, and cleaner if possible, to just somehow retry communicating with the vm and present a status icon 'waiting to sync with vm' until a successful return of the container list is completed?  Or is it not possible to know if communication becomes successful with the VM?\n. Without some kind of status, a user might not know he needs to click the re-sync button anyways.  It's probably not easier, but it seems like constant checking of vm communication with retries is the 'right' solution for the best UX.  But in the short term, a button would help immensely :):)\n. Here we go:  https://gist.github.com/dbartow/2422bbaa385136f36aab\nThe first initialization in there was the successful one I did last night, starting the Default VM then Kitematic.  I can see a bunch of container ID/json messages at the end of it just like @klousiaj saw.  The second init, done 18 hours later (just now) was an unsuccessful start where I just fired up Kitematic and it started the Default VM but never synced properly.\n. Just tried the new version and no change.  I did notice that the Electron IPC warnings are gone now tho :) :+1: \n. Would love to test it!  I might need some instructions on how to do so, though.  Since it's not in Master yet (I think) and Im not set up as a local developer, and just a generally unskilled developer, how do I go about that lol :)  Thanks!\n. ",

Ok I have been working on this, and have it working for the most part, but I really wanted to write some tests to make sure the behavior was working properly on each menu item.

Has anyone tried updating react-router? It looks like the latest react-router npm package is at version 2. For now I think I am going to stub out the router just so I can have awesome tests. And then create a different PR for updating react-router. Thoughts? \n. Sorry @pmario it took me a really long time to get the jest tests to work, but in the long run I think it will pay off. I still need to refactor the header, what I have right now is a bad hack for the header. I would be curious to hear some feedback on my menu builder design.

I think for now this will be an easier direction than trying to implement a native looking menu in React. I can get my original PR up to speed if need be. \n. Yea so in my PR I had it optionally switching between frame:true and frame:false depending on whether or not a user was in windows or mac. In this PR we just set frame:true everywhere, and just handle the position of elements in the topbar based on whether or not we are in windows. I do think the work I did around the menu would definitely still apply. Originally I was going to try and remake all the \"native\" looking controls in React, At a high level something like this. If your ok with it we add the frame back in everywhere, we will just have to work a little harder to make it look pretty in windows. WDYT @FrenchBen I am working on getting my branch up to date, and I think I will finally have time to finish my PR, in which I can make it frame:true, and include some of the changes in this PR. I am really sorry it to so long. What are your thoughts @mikaoelitiana ?\n.

As I explained above I found out how to use our proxy, but the problem is still the inserted certificate which is self signed. Everything works within my docker runtime. The problem remains in Kitematic as well as in docker-machine. Corporate proxies are always creating problems with tools heavily relying on the use of internet...\n. It would be nice if you could mention which technologies/frameworks were used to build Kitematic. This would not only advertise those technologies, but it would also simplify the task for people like me who try to \"debug\" issues with the software to find out where to look for.\nI cannot try \"Docker on Windows\" as we are still constrained to use Win 7. \nConcerning the request library, I looked at the code and I saw that not all switches/options from the ENV vars are taken into account...\nI haven't checked Steven's answer yet:\n\nNot the most \"safe\" option but you can set the env var NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 to have request/node ignore certificate errors which will get you past that error behind a corporate proxy. \n. Well, I don't really understand why you ask us to use Docker for Windows. We are talking about Kitematic which is not able to browse the image repository. We all said that a docker instance properly configured is able to retrieve images on the internet.\n\nHow will Docker for Windows help to solve the Kitematic issue???\n. ",

The images screen only showed There was an error contacting Docker Hub and   the login screen showed unable to verify the first certificate, after submiting my credentials.\nI tryed several other stuff, (exporting proxy upper and lowercase, set the CA path in my .npmrc, set strict-ssl to false via npm config, set  DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY to 0) but nothing worked.

    "PeterMcLaren": "@jmborer I can help here and add my support - I have the same issue and I am running Win 10 with Docker for Windows. \nI am behind a corp proxy and therefore I duly configured this during the setup of DfW:\nTo be clear - all the command line (docker search, docker pull etc) work perfectly first time (so through the proxy) with no further action on my part.\nKitematic installed fine, and can manipulate images I have download via the command line. However, Kitematic will not connect to docker hub on startup (and errors elsewhere in the UI in a similar way). \nI tried the environment variables but appears to ignore this and attempts to lookup hub.docker.com and connect. We don't resolve public records in our DNS environment (only the proxy can) so this fails. If I then add a hostfile entry for hub.docker.com, it attempts a direct 443 connection to that address - in other words it makes no attempt to use a proxy.\n(I should add I don't have the cert problem specifically as our proxy does not interfere with the SSL tunnel) - I came on this thread looking for kitematic proxy solutions for win 10.) :-)\n. @FrenchBen I didn't - I set it in the windows master environment - but I did check at a command prompt that I could see it. I'll try that and let you know. thanks.\n. @FrenchBen  Thanks - the command line method worked. I went back and reviewed my user environment variable settings in the system settings and rebooted. that now works too - so I must have made a typo somewhere.

That's very nice to learn!. Could it be that even when we have switched Docker to use Windows containers, and Docker can no longer open Linux containers, the Exec button in Kitematic is still wired to launch sh?\nHere is the error when I run a command like Kitematic might be attempting. \n\nPS C:\\Program Files\\Docker\\Docker> docker run -it d9bccb9d4cac sh\nC:\\Program Files\\Docker\\Docker\\Resources\\bin\\docker.exe: Error response from daemon: container 9962ecd27ce7313bd79783b69f51084e6d0abed92650d562cde8f1c01a5a2c35 encountered an error during CreateProcess: failure in a Windows system call: The system cannot find the file specified.

Create Key: \"SHELL\" with the value \"cmd.exe\" or \"powershell.exe\", and the Exec button now works just fine.\n\nHere's some commentary I have on this issue: I would suggest that because the system tray application for Docker has a menu item \"Switch to Windows containers...\", Kitematic must become aware that when Docker is in Windows containers mode. When this occurs, all containers will be Windows containers and are simply not going to accept 'sh'. \nMy thought on how to fix these issues surrounding the Exec button: I'd suggest that the SHELL environment Variable is always visible. In other words, Environment Variables should by default list the key: \"SHELL\" that indicates the value \"/bin/sh\" (currently the default). This is apparently how Kitematic is dealing with the shell issue anyway, but because it's hidden, it's been a little difficult to really understand how to deal with the problem. This way, users get the default shell but can understand how to change to the shell they want. \n. As @FrenchBen has described in other issue reports, the bash shell is not opened when the Exec button is pressed. The sh shell is the default. Powershell does not interact properly with the sh shell so you should switch to bash. I am adding this text to the FAQ, which explains how to deal with this issue:\n\nKitematic uses sh for the Exec function. This can cause unwanted behavior, such as up arrows being displayed as '^[[A' in Powershell terminal. This is unavoidable, because not all docker containers have a bash shell (or csh, zsh, etc.). One way to use the bash shell, which does not have these limitations, is simply to type \"bash\" into the terminal each time that a new session is started.\nIf you want your bash shell to be the default shell for when you 'exec' into the container, then in Settings > Advanced, simply add an entry for SHELL with a value of /bin/bash.

Once again, I don't know what you're talking about.\nIn Docker, I have a Postgres 9.3.13 image - with port 5432 mapped to local port 5432.\nInitially, my problem was that I had a (homebrew) installed Postgres instance. So, when trying to start the Docker image, there would be a port conflict with the system installed Postgres instance.\nI then killed the system, installed installed, and found the same result came from trying to start  second Postgres 9.3.13 instance in Docker.\nThis problem is VERY repeatable - either within Docker, or in fact for any port conflict.\nThe issue is SIMPLY that a Docker instance can't be started if the port is already in use. Unfortunately, the error reported is completely unrelated.\nIf a noob like me can replicate this issue so readily, then you're obviously approaching this from an assumption that I am dumb and I have it wrong. \n. I can show that you CAN:\nOne container with Postgres:latest mapped to 5432:5432\n\nand one with Postgres:9.1.13 mapped to 5432:5432\n\nIn fact, there is a 3rd mapped to 5432:5432 - but that's irrelevant.\nIf I now try to start the 2nd instance, no error message is shown\n\nIf I then navigate to Settings and click on 'Save' (having changed nothing)\n\nthen when I navigate back to 'Home' it shows\n\nAs invited on that dialog, I filed a ticket.\n. It only seems to detect a port conflict if there is another container running on that port. Otherwise I can add a new container and assign it to port 5432\n\nMy original issue that that there was a postgres instance running outside Docker, and the port conflict with that was not detected, and I got the error scenario I demonstrated in my previous post.\nSo there are 2 ways to replicate the same problem.\n.

As mentioned in #1991 (or more specifically in comment https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/1991#issuecomment-247480423) this is due to the fact that docker (at the moment) cannot change portmappings of a configured container.

So I launch powershell.exe on my host (via that path which is default location) and it will in turn connect to powershell.exe on that specific container I was targeting. Am I  misunderstaing something?. I don't do \"docker exec\" at all. I do Enter-Pssession to remote into container. So is feature \"Exec\" from Kitematic is supposed to be working on Windows containers? . Docker exec as well as Enter-PSSession work just fine to container.

Thanks FrenchBen,\nOkay - I thought everything was working, both Linux mode and Windows mode (I was following a Pluralsight course), but now looking at this hello-world only appears to run in Linux mode.

    "ajlanghorn": "I don't know if that is a resolution; more that it's a workaround for your specific use case. registry-1.docker.io is signed by a certificate issued by RapidSSL, who are in turn signed by GeoTrust. The GeoTrust root CA is installed, usually by default, so I wonder whether or not your connections to the outside world are being mitm'd, and whatever under the hood that Kitematic uses to make a connection is realising this, and refusing to connect since the certificate presented back to Kitematic is different to the one that actually should be presented.\nA better workaround, assuming the above, would be to get whatever egress proxy sits between you and the outside world to accept and properly pass back the certificate issued to registry-1.docker.io.\nAn option to disable SSL verification seems nasty to me, since it encourages bad behaviours and allows for excuses to thrive. Offering a HTTP version of the registry seems like a regression: the web is moving more and more toward accepting HTTPS by default. Kitematic shouldn't really introduce a regression unless there's a very valid and popular need to do so, which I don't think there is here.. ",
    "mateodelnorte": "Yes, I'm behind a corporate firewall. But, no there is no prescribed proxy settings for users here. \n@ajlanghorn I agree it's not the perfect solution for a perfect world, but in reality there are thousands of developers stuck behind corporate firewalls where their IT departments have not property configured their network or firewall settings. As a result, they face the problems I'm facing and fixing network appliance settings, for instance, in a 200,000 person organization is a political problem far harder fought than just setting an environment variable to ssl-strict=false. . Frankly, I think this project should favor flexibility for the purpose of fueling adoption. But that's just my opinion, and as it stands and for the reasons above, I am having difficulty setting inroads for it at my very large organization. . I'm not following. If you're saying I should set up a proxy for my corporate firewall, as described here https://github.com/docker/kitematic/wiki/Common-Proxy-Issues-&-Fixes, I mentioned my org doesn't use one. To your point, because corp firewall settings are more difficult to navigate than flicking a switch in Kitematic, that's exactly why Kitematic should have a setting allowing it to be lenient in this case. \nnpm allows exactly this: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#strict-ssl\nI guess what I'm pointing out here is that by electing to not offer an option to skip ssl validation, you're essentially saying that Kitematic only works within organizations that share Docker's security mentality. And, you're not providing a road map for improvement to those that currently don't. Something to keep in mind is that some organizations are incredibly large and changes start within them in small groups working to improve the larger structure. . ",

    "rick02840": "BTW Kitematic version is 0.12.0 and I got it by clicking the link in the Docker for Mac icon (the spouting whale icon at top of Mac window).  As I recall, a link to get Kitematic appears in a popup if you click the 'Open Kitematic\" link in that Docker icon and you do not have Kitematic installed yet. \n^ so this may be the way to get Kitematic for Docker for Mac.  But note below it was asking for Virtual box at first.  \nSo anyhow...   shortly after I posted above I seem to have it running OK.  \nAt first it was asking for Virtual Box to be installed.  I did that, as I needed it anyhow.  Then Kitematic would start, but showed none of the containers I had created with docker-compose up.  Guessing because it is looking for containers in the VM not in Docker for Mac.\nAnyhow, I shut down Virtual Box and started Kitematic again.  It briefly shows the screen when it is starting up the VM, but then loads the main interface and I can see the containers I had created.  So, guess it's working for now. \nI see Kitematic as sort of like a Git GUI - not necessary, since everything can be done on command line - but nice to have a visual of what's going on. . ",

Thank you @FrenchBen , let me know.. @FrenchBen thank you very much for the feedback.\n1) Post-installation steps for Linux \nCan you give some hint about which one is not working for you? Anyway, this probably is misleading.\nThere are two (one for the Ubuntu and Arch section) internal links to an anchor for the Post installation steps for Linux section (in the same page), basically where there are the following quick instructions:\n```\n$ sudo groupadd docker\n$ sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker\n$ sudo service docker restart\n```\nand  the quick hint To activate the changes to docker group either do a $ newgrp docker, ...\nBoth of those links to the anchor work for me (Chrome & Firefox). \nDirect link to Linux-Install.md#post-installation-steps-for-linux anchor\nLink to Linux-Install.md page\nAlso, in the A couple useful links for post-installation steps for Linux there is a direct link to the external (Docker site) Post-installation steps for Linux.\nAs said, this probably is misleading and it is better to reformulate it.\n2) Ubuntu Dash. (windows key)\nAbsolutely correct. I used a generic terminal, graphical menu sentence (at the end of the Post installation steps for Linux section) and not referring directly to Ubuntu Dash because, well, may be users do not have Ubuntu Dash (personally I use i3wm and rofi / Kupfer on Ubuntu). \nI will fix both the misleading links and the reference to Ubuntu Dash. In the meantime, if you have suggestions, please let me know.. Can you expand on the concept at point 2?. @FrenchBen never came back to this issue because, for the distro I have tested, the installation is currently straightforward. . ",

Isn't the the red reset button supposed to solve the issue and give the option to go for 'native' docker?. The reset button doesn't solve #2499 (on MacOS). I had to use the useVM = false in the console to make it work.. I have the same issue. It is very annoying indeed as the user has to type slowly, making sure one key is ever pressed at one time.. Hi @FrenchBen , thanks for the response. \n\nBy default docker will always try and use the latest image.\n\nActually 'latest' is a misleading concept in Docker! Kitematic will try the latest tag from 'My Images' screen. If 'latest' tag now points to a new Image on Dockerhub, well Kitematic will not try not pull the latest image because it has 'a' latest tag already.\nJust to be clear, I'm not suggesting a completely automatic redeployment by Kitematic. The Feature Request could be split in two parts. Let's take the simplest case: the users have created a container based on image X:latest. I push a new 'latest' image on Dockerhub. At the moment there's no way for the users to know there's a new image. You can compare that with some traditional desktop apps that send the user a notification when a new version is ready to be downloaded (e.g. VirtualBox): either via regular polling or when the user explicitly asks whether a new version is available. Giving the user at least a way to check for new versions from Kitematic would be great.\nThe second part of the Feature Request is the simplification of the upgrade procedure. Right now if someone wants to upgrade a container, they have to: remove the container, search again for the image name (because the one in My Image will not allow them to pull new tags), and create a new Container from the Image they have found then possibly re-configure the the Container (e.g. port mapping, enabled volumes). Having a button to do all that with one click would be a great step forward; bringing Kitematic and Docker closer to what basic end users expect from a modern app or app store. At the moment I think it's 90% there, what's left doesn't look too difficult to implement logically as long as the mechanism are well designed.\nMy point for supporting this feature(s) is that Docker has an image versioning system built-in and I find it surprising that it's not better exploited by Kitematic at least to provide an experience that many users of desktop application expect from softwares that can be upgraded from the web.\n.

Back to the roots I guess.\nWhat am I doing wrong here? :rofl: . Yeah, I have Kaspersky installed on that Notebook, but as far as I know it shouldn't be a problem, since I never had any with it. But I will look it up when I'm back tomorrow to get sure.. As expected, Kaspersky doesn't block anything.. Seems like I got it working now. It was still a Proxy Issue from the very first start... Sorry for the inconvenience.\nWhat I did was using this script out of your Wiki:\n\nset proxy=YOUR_PROXY\nSET HTTP_PROXY=%proxy%\nSET HTTPS_PROXY=%proxy%\nfor /f %%i in ('docker-machine.exe ip default') do set DOCKER_HOST=%%i\nSET NO_PROXY=%DOCKER_HOST%\nset DOCKER_HOST=tcp://%DOCKER_HOST%:2376\ncd Kitematic\nKitematic.exe\n\n\nYes, I tried it yesterday as well, but today I saw that of no reason I put some \"\" before and after YOUR_PROXY which seems like that it made that whole script unfunctional.\nBut I do have another Problem now. I can't download Ansible. I'm able to download and install other Containers, but Ansible won't work as shown in the Screenshot.\n\nIs that something you could help me to fix or do I have to open a new thread in the ansible repo?\n. I passed through this problem myself again and unfortunately I can confirm that this is incorrect. :sweat_smile: \nWhat you can see on the screenshot was the try to download one of their existing tags with kitematic. And I guess it is what you said, that Kitematic tried (because it's a standard variable i guess) to download the \"latest\" image from Ansbile, but since there is no \"latest\" tag in their Git, Kitematic wasn't able to download it. \nI opened up a Thread to Ansible at that time. You can see what I did, here:\nhttps://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/24433\nBut I got it all working now. Had some enterprise issues coming with some typical standard docker issues which made it kinda impossible for me to get along with all this stuff at first (since I'm a total Docker newb), but I got it all fixed now. (Hopefully.. took me like a week to get it all working :sweat_smile: )\nThanks for your support @FrenchBen and keep up the work!\nGreetings from Germany,\nJosh. ",

Any possibility to have this merged into the future release?. I could try in my free time. Aparrently, newer version of electron causes other bugs to appear.

Well, TS things are not related to electron-builder.\nI can try to support the old release way, but the old way would not be compat with creating app packages. Well, there are a electron-builder images for building linux and win (not appx).\nBut i dont think there are any image for macOS.\nI can try sto search some other solutions. Ok, I have added a package.script called \"release:all-zip\".\nThis should build only .zip for all plataforms (But it will only completely in MacOS due MacOS requirement).\nHere is more information about building for all plataforms: https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build\nSeems like we are going to need 3 diferent CIs. :(\nAlso, I'm going to open an issue in electron-builder to try to avoid the MacOS requirements with only .zip packages. @FrenchBen .

Up please, someone here ? Could the patch be implemented for next release ?. Thanks @FrenchBen for your post.\nMachinge get default machine name as default name, but it can be used with other names (docker-machine [command] [machine name]). Machine work great with other names.\nProblem with Kinematic is it won't work at all with other names. default name is hardcoded on it and there is no way to indicate it to use another machine name. When Kinematic start if it don't find the default name machine, it even attempt to create it... : (\nTo answer to your question, i think if env var is set and machine is not found, it can do any of the following (by order of best preference):\n- send an error message (i don't think it is the purpose of Kinematic to create the VM... so for me it is the best, and it give the developper the possibility to create manually the machine)\n- create the machine with this name (like it does actually for default)\n- create a default machine and use it\nBut the real problem in this issue is Kinematic cannot be used with machine with other name than default, and it limit its usablility. Docker Toolbox do not force to use default. You can create any new VM name you want with docker-machine.\nAnd the patch is so easy to implement, and will bring so more to Kinematic, that actually i don't see any raison to not implement it. We don't talk about big code change here.. I undestand better thanks for the explaination.\nI was not aware that:\n- Kinematic cannot read Windows system/user environment variables\n- Kinematic has the job to manage the VM (create, etc.) (i thought Kinematic was only to manage container in a docker instance)\n- Kinematic has a \"delete VM\" policie if it don't manage to connect to VM\nI am just not agree on you last sentence \"default is the Kitematic preferred VM, and the one that should always be used for boot2docker things\". It is more right to say Kinematic actually can only be used with default, this is not a preferred VM as there is no choice (and this is purpose of this issue which could be resolved i hope). For boot2docker, it has never been mandatory to use default, using another name works very great, just Kinematic don't handle it. In fact developpers could even have several boot2docker VM, this is the puprose of docker-machine, be able to create/manage multipe machine and so multiple boot2docker. Forcing it to only one VM called default is reducting. For instance, what about swarm in this case ? Or testing local cluster environment, etc...\nI think if Kinematic cannot read windows environment the old patch could be reincluded (kinematic read a config file). To prevent machine deletion, if the VM kinematic try to start is not default, it could just report \"Cannot connect\" and that's all. It should not have an option to destroy and recreate... It is to the user to do it so VM cannot be deleted accidentaly. And we can consider that an user using not the default name is more advanced than a user staying on default so he know how to handle the problem.\nWhat do you think of this approach?\np.s: does your deletion exemple apply to default too ? If i create a \"default\" VM for some project (imagine a CentOS VM) and start Kinematic it can destroy it ? If yes, deletion problem is not particularly tied to not use the default name for the VM in this case but more an other global issue i think.. I understand your reflexion and need to keep it simple. Thanks for taking time talking about this issue.\nI hope somedays we could use kinematic with different host/VM name (like portainer does for instance).\n. ",

    "leosco": "So? I don't understand why the source of the image matters for it to work properly in Kitematic. Are you saying that Kitematic is designed to only work on images that are hosted on Docker Hub? I understand that Elastic deprecated their images on Docker and moved them to their own domain. Why should where the images were downloaded from matter for Kitematic to be useful?\nThat doesn't make sense. If you've already pulled the image into Docker, why should Kitematic throw a  404 when creating the container using the GUI? The image is already downloaded on the local storage. If I create the container using the CLI, I can still use it in the GUI, so clearly the issue is with how Kitematic creating the container.\nSee below, if I create the containers using the terminal, they appear in the GUI\n\nIt's only when I attempt to create them using the GUI, that I get a 404 error. There obviously an issue here, not sure why you closed it.... That's exactly what it's doing then. You're hard-coding Kitematic to break unless the image was sourced directly from Docker Hub. If it's not you @FrenchBen I'd love if you could point me to the right person to speak to about this. \nWhy bother making an open source GUI for Docker if you're going to build in trivial proprietary roadblocks? The functionality is already there in the CLI, available to everyone. What's the point of restricting it in the GUI?. I don't have that error. I run my images from https://www.docker.elastic.co/ just fine.\nThe name of the image in the local Docker store isn't just elasticsearch. You have to do docker run docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.1.3.\nIf you run docker image ls, it will show you the proper image names to use:\nterminal\ndocker image ls -a\nREPOSITORY                                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\ndocker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana                 6.1.3               a3f439b54fc4        9 days ago          963MB\ndocker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch   6.1.3               abeec10402ff        9 days ago          556MB\nPerhaps that's why Kitematic is throwing a 404, it's not using the right image name?. I completely understand that. \nWhat I'm concerned about is that, using the CLI, I can download an image from any source, like https://www.docker.elastic.co/ and use it with the full functionality of Docker available to me. I'm not limited to only images from Docker Hub.\nThen when I try to do the exact same thing in Kitematic, which is a GUI for Docker, and you would reasonably assume it has the same functionality, it doesn't work. You just told me it only is designed to work with images from Docker Hub.\nThat must be an issue, or if it is the intended behavior, then I disagree with it.\nBecause is means that Kitematic would be artificially restricting features available to users that are already available to them in Docker CLI.. Docker doesn't only work with images from Docker Hub, does it?\nSo why does Kitematic have that restriction, be it intentionally or not?\nI'll see if I can fork the repo and figure out where this is happening, because I feel like unless it's intentional, Kitematic should be able to work with non-Docker Hub images.. ^^^^^^ my point exactly\nOn Fri, Feb 9, 2018, 16:24 Dylan Stankievech notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI'm also experiencing this behaviour trying to upgrade to elastic search\n6.x\nAfter doing docker pull\ndocker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.1\nI can see the 6.2.1 image in My Images, but clicking Create results in the\n404 error\nI noticed the error message says:\n(HTTP code 404) no such image - no such image:\ndocker.elastic.co/elasticsearch:6.2.1: No such image:\ndocker.elastic.co/elasticsearch:6.2.1\nwhich seems to suggest it's looking for\ndocker.elastic.co/elasticsearch:6.2.1 instead of\ndocker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.1\nIt seems strange to me if this is expected behaviour,\nthat it allows downloading of images from other than Docker Hub, and\ndisplays them, but doesn't allow creation of containers from them.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/3549#issuecomment-364572162,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ALLn4mw4vQ5d2jTMHrbvPdshNuMaOCgjks5tTLeegaJpZM4RzBi5\n.\n. \n",

Playing with the issue I have found that when I run\ndocker run --rm -it --net=host jeci/jbake-docker\nThe CLI returns that there is no latest tag.\nSo viewing it from kitematic I show that the latest tag is 2.5.0 and by running\ndocker run --rm -it --net=host jeci/jbake-docker:2.5.0 the image was finally downloaded.. The initial poster had a problem with the \"postgres container\".\nI have just found that the specific container I wanted to use at the time did not had a tag labeled \"latest\" in its repository that caused the issue.\nIf I use a specific tag in command line CLI or Kitematic it works. \nBut kitematic container browser has as default tag the tag \"latest\" even if it does not exists in the container repo.\nI hope this will help people with similar issues..

However, so far I have tested it, I experienced no problems.\nPrerequisites:\n- Docker\n- Nodejs 9.x.y (that is one of these)\n- Npm (the one bundled with Arch is fine)\n- Grunt (the package is now called: grunt-cli)\n- Git\n- All you may want if you want to make a PKGBUILD out of it\nPreparation:\n- Unpack somewhere the Nodejs 9 release (you can safely delete it after the build process; let's call it $NODEDIR)\n- git clone --recursive https://github.com/docker/kitematic.git somewhere else (let's call it $KITEDIR)\n- Edit $KITEDIR/Gruntfile such that line (as of now) 224 which currently looks like\ncommand: 'cd build && npm install --production'\nthen looks like\ncommand: 'cd build && npm install --production --force'\n- Perform, in the shell you will use for the build process:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$NODEDIR/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\nexport PATH=\"$NODEDIR/bin/:$PATH\"\nBuild process:\n- cd $KITEDIR && npm install # may throw some errors\n- cd $KITEDIR && npm run release # will throw some errors for sure\nDistribution:\n- The directory $KITEDIR/dist/Kitematic-linux-x64 is what should be put in $PKGDIR when distribution the package, and Kitematic is the executable.\nCAVEATS:\nThis procedure worked for me just out of luck, because of the fact that the errors arising from the build process and partially suppressed by the --force switch did not interfere with the real build process but were only (as fas as I can tell and test) side effects of the fact that:\n- this project officially targets Windows, Mac and Ubuntu (that it *.deb distribution files)\n- there are some tslint deprecations in the project\nI cannot tell if this project is dead, will die shortly or is in pre-death maintainance mode (at least for Linux-based OSs), but these steps are provided under the conditions of the just make it run, no matter what philosophy. I hope you can find them useful.\nGood luck with the build! :wink: . ",
