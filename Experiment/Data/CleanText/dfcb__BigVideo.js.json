Hey,\nthanks for making the playlist-examples branch available. Can you specify what is not working and what testing setup you use?\nIn FF v30 on Mac OS X both examples (example-multiformats.html and example-multiformats-playlist.html) seem to be correctly loading the mp4 video / videos. When setting the useFlashForFirefox:false flag to true both examples correctly use the Flash fallback (even though for some reason the scaling does not work, the Flash doesn't cover the whole page).\nAs far as I understand videoJS will go through the list of video objects and determine itself which video file is best suited, and the techOrder array that the useFlashForFirefox flag affects seems to be working correctly as well. (On a sidenote, as this boolean is actually just setting the techOrder and no longer sniffing the user agent, it might make sense to rename it).\n. Any feedback on this?\n. It would seem the local server you use is serving the webm video files with the wrong content type. You should be able to just check if the webm plays at all in a standalone page with the video tag and a webm source. I suspect it has nothing to do with BigVideo, actually.\n. Thanks again for checking. Can you link to a concrete file / test that fails? Safari will need a mp4 source, so if you test multi-source without mp4 or single source, that could be the reason.\n. Hey,\nI can reproduce this with the sample file. Chrome plays fine, but Safari 8 does not. The funny bit is this: Switching the order to mp4 first, it plays in both browsers, both mp4. Now ideally you'd want Chrome to play webm and Safari mp4 after realizing it can't play the first webm source. Why it does not do this, I do not know.\nSome research would point to this being a combination of: VideoJS detecting a false positive for webm on Safari, encodings of the video and the operating system support for those, order of checking supported file formats in VideoJS.\nAs such, this is nothing to do with the way this patch to BigVideo uses VideoJS, but rather VideoJS itself.\n.

The\ncustom CSS was actually fixing another issue, which was making the\ncontainer fill the entire space, before the video was actually loaded.\nBecause Firefox is using Flash, it seems to act a bit funny.\n[image: screen shot 2014-10-31 at 12 16 18 pm]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2483515/4853910/024668be-608b-11e4-93a2-9abd2cfa6589.png\nWith you guys having issues, I would suggest updating your flash player,\nmight help.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/issues/146#issuecomment-61186792.\n. Firefox doesn't support mp4/m4v very well. You need to add additional video formats like this (you need to encode additional video formats, not just add in the links):\n\nBV.show([\n          { type: \"video/mp4\",  src: \"http://player.vimeo.com/external/107089378.hd.m4v\" },\n          { type: \"video/webm\", src: \"http://player.vimeo.com/external/107089378.hd.webm\" },\n          { type: \"video/ogg\",  src: \"http://player.vimeo.com/external/107089378.hd.ogv\" }]\n      );\n. I had originally tried to use the mp4 link from Vimeo and it didn't load in\nfirefox.  My solution was just to compress the video to the other formats\nand use the code I posted earlier.\nI used this plugin: Video Embed & Thumbnail Generator for wordpress. It\nrequires FFMPEG to be installed on your server.\nIf it's not rendering until resize, I can't help with that, sorry!\n\nms. oka tai-lee\n412.608.7669\nOn Wed, Oct 29, 2014 at 7:24 PM, michaeltrilford notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIt was working during testing, now it is not.\nWe are using Vimeo, which is recommended. The video appears when the\nwindow is resized. The dimensions of the browser don't seem to be injected\non to big-video-vid wrapper.\nFreaking out!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/issues/146#issuecomment-61022574.\n. @chris - i am not using vimeo to host the video.  i have uploaded it\ndirectly to wordpress (which then converted it) and am just accessing the\nurls from wordpress. sorry i wasn't clear!\n\n\nms. oka tai-lee\n412.608.7669\nOn Thu, Oct 30, 2014 at 7:18 PM, michaeltrilford notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nJust an update.\nWe have fixed this issue, as there was some custom CSS being used.
