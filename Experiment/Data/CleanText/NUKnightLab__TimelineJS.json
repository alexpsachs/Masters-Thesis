It would appear that the package is already registered.

To be quite honest, we don't use Bower. If the community wants it, I'm happy to do the minor administration of integrating details, but I don't expect to add that documentation unless it comes in the form of a pull request. \n. Thank you @nimashahbazi90 \n. Thank you, but copying the build directory is not the ideal way to make the 'examples' viewable. Instead, I've fixed the readme to instruct people to run the web server from the correct directory.\n. I manually integrated 23a1e91 and built as part of testing your other contributions, and as noted, f654a30 is obsolete because someone contributed the missing image. So this is effectively closed, though not technically merged.  Thanks for your contributions.\n. Sorry for the delay. I had a small crisis of confidence in accepting language patch requests considering I don't speak most of the languages... but then I figured I would just rely on Google Translate to sanity check.\n. There don't seem to be any problems embedding YouTube URLs in any of our test cases. Can you provide the value you entered for the media URL?\nfor instance, I just used this YouTube URL on timeline.knightlab.com and got the expected behavior without your patch.\n. Interesting. The referenced page labels months like foarmanne with the word Bijnaam, which translates as nickname. In English, nicknames are the opposite of \"elegant and classical\".\nThis points up a challenge we have with accepting contributions for translation files for languages we don't speak. Any ideas for other sources we could check for priority, rather than having this be a matter of taste?\nTechnically, we could also support both, simply by having different menu choices, like \"Frisian (bijnaam)\" and \"Frisian (???)\" if we can come up with clear labels. Then the files would be \"fy_bijnaam.js\" and whatever is appropriate to the other form.\n. Is there still interest in this patch? Can I get some input from Frisian speakers?\n. It looks like it's all part of trying to negotiate mixed-content pages. I'm a little nervous about taking it out, but then again, it seems arbitrary, and apparently in some cases just wrong. More to the point, it seems presumptuous for the library to do this. If it matters, people providing the URL should be responsible.\nThanks!\n. These files aren't actually ever used, but until we strip them out of the CSS, we may as well accept your PR. Thanks!\n. @defbyte You may be right, but (a) backwards compatibility is a higher priority for us and (b) in this case, it is to do with MSIE (a non-trivial component of our audience) reading Google Spreadsheets, which is fundamental to TImelineJS working.  So \"shoulds\" aside, we have to go with what works for the sizeable majority of our user base.\nBut yes, there would be a version bump with any adjustment to the code.\n. TimelineJS 2.34.1 has been released. If you want to pin to 2.34.0 it is at http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/2.34.0/js/timeline-min.js \n. black does not seem to be a valid option for color (line 1438 of your patch)\n. thank you!\n. Thank you.\n. When I install these requirements, fab no longer functions correctly.\n. Thanks, but the current usage adheres to AP style, and merging your change would retroactively change previously created timelines. Since there hasn't been discussion I've seen, it doesn't seem worth changing in the core. If we need to improve the docs on how to override the style with your own preferences, let us know.\n.

It's not really clear to me how that could work without the bower.json file having existed, but those of you who are concerned with this issue should advise if there's actually more to do.\n. To be quite honest, we don't use Bower. If the community wants it, I'm happy to do the minor administration of integrating details, but I don't expect to add that documentation unless it comes in the form of a pull request. \n. Thank you @nimashahbazi90 \n. Thank you, but copying the build directory is not the ideal way to make the 'examples' viewable. Instead, I've fixed the readme to instruct people to run the web server from the correct directory.\n. I manually integrated 23a1e91 and built as part of testing your other contributions, and as noted, f654a30 is obsolete because someone contributed the missing image. So this is effectively closed, though not technically merged.  Thanks for your contributions.\n. Sorry for the delay. I had a small crisis of confidence in accepting language patch requests considering I don't speak most of the languages... but then I figured I would just rely on Google Translate to sanity check.\n. There don't seem to be any problems embedding YouTube URLs in any of our test cases. Can you provide the value you entered for the media URL?\nfor instance, I just used this YouTube URL on timeline.knightlab.com and got the expected behavior without your patch.\n. Interesting. The referenced page labels months like foarmanne with the word Bijnaam, which translates as nickname. In English, nicknames are the opposite of \"elegant and classical\".\nThis points up a challenge we have with accepting contributions for translation files for languages we don't speak. Any ideas for other sources we could check for priority, rather than having this be a matter of taste?\nTechnically, we could also support both, simply by having different menu choices, like \"Frisian (bijnaam)\" and \"Frisian (???)\" if we can come up with clear labels. Then the files would be \"fy_bijnaam.js\" and whatever is appropriate to the other form.\n. Is there still interest in this patch? Can I get some input from Frisian speakers?\n. It looks like it's all part of trying to negotiate mixed-content pages. I'm a little nervous about taking it out, but then again, it seems arbitrary, and apparently in some cases just wrong. More to the point, it seems presumptuous for the library to do this. If it matters, people providing the URL should be responsible.\nThanks!\n. These files aren't actually ever used, but until we strip them out of the CSS, we may as well accept your PR. Thanks!\n. @defbyte You may be right, but (a) backwards compatibility is a higher priority for us and (b) in this case, it is to do with MSIE (a non-trivial component of our audience) reading Google Spreadsheets, which is fundamental to TImelineJS working.  So \"shoulds\" aside, we have to go with what works for the sizeable majority of our user base.\nBut yes, there would be a version bump with any adjustment to the code.\n. TimelineJS 2.34.1 has been released. If you want to pin to 2.34.0 it is at http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/2.34.0/js/timeline-min.js \n. black does not seem to be a valid option for color (line 1438 of your patch)\n. thank you!\n. Thank you.\n. When I install these requirements, fab no longer functions correctly.\n. Thanks, but the current usage adheres to AP style, and merging your change would retroactively change previously created timelines. Since there hasn't been discussion I've seen, it doesn't seem worth changing in the core. If we need to improve the docs on how to override the style with your own preferences, let us know.\n. Thank you.\n. I ended up opting for your simpler strategy. Thanks for the contribution.\n. Thank you.\n. thank you\n. thank you. (\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f?)\n.
