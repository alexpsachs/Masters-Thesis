Twidere will go back to previously used app when pressing 'Back' button, if you need to stay in Twidere, press 'Navigate Up' in toolbar instead.\n. Have you try newest beta builds? https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases\nThis should work.\n. @mkody https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 you may need to use official key. vine support is available only for official clients\n. @mkody sweet! I'll implement soon.\n. implemented.\n. @moshpirit Well, I'd like to implement that but I don't even know which GNU social instance is most popular and suitable for my development, and no api documentation given.\n. Hi everyone, I found the reason to this issue, will fix in next commit.\n. @asterismo It works fine on quitter.se. Let's move this issue to another issue #290.\n. fixed in cf03196923d5d67b0fc3f6219b816e4d579b1d43, now timeline scrolls to top instantly.\n. does it fixed in newest version?\n. confirmed, really annoying\n. does it work?\n. fixed in newest versions.\n. does new version fixed this?

I'll close this issue.\n. great idea, I'll try implement that.\n. This issue seems obsolete, if you encountered any other problems, fell free to reopen or create new issue.\n. this should work in newest version. have you tried? @HamiTsuka @orithena \n. seems it's a streaming video. I'll ignore this field now, make it at least able to get tweets.\n. fixed.\n. implemented in newest versions.\n. could you provide the twitter link or screenshot? seems https://twitter.com/#!/mariotaku not work but https://twitter.com/mariotaku is supported.\n. tried, seems fixed.\n. @oprudkyi could you provide links not work?\n. is third issue fixed?\n. link highlighting fixed in 490b1d3aef17e8c850fbef2b5baede0ea6d1a42a\n. unread count implemented in 6d76e18d8a39e7d159a5b6c4563537c14e2f1c27.\n. does remember position work?\n. @lescheff how about enable 'read from bottom' option?\n. ok, I'll close this issue.\n. fixed in 1371bb901c9995fb30077e5feddf5938d55e01af.\n.

Seems newest versions are working.\n. This should be fixed in recent versions.\n. weird. I haven't find that in my code.\n. Seems It's the same problem with #112. \nMaybe I should migrate all Void[] to Object[].\n\nOh I hate Java generic types.\n. that will be fixed in next release soon.\n. here, fixed in bd0198a6237940c56063723f8ff221553b179dc0.\n.

I'll finish that soon.\n. implemented in 6d76e18d8a39e7d159a5b6c4563537c14e2f1c27\n. this should be fixed in recent versions.\n. sweet! maybe you should use application name in manifest instead hardcoded \"Twittnuker\"?\n. Same problem with #106. merge them into one.\n. done.\n. Save failed rts/favs to drafts is finished.\nSchedule tweets (via buffer) is finished also.\nClosing this issue for now, if you have more suggestions, feel free to make a new issue.. Fixed, profile type icon will be also hidden when profile image is disabled in next release.\n. not a bug, twidere uses build date to indicate version number while f-droid removed this.\n. I'm not able to testing it since SMS support is not available in China. would be awesome if someone could provide a test account to me.\n. implemented 2fa in b720abe8b24b202b4a3604d595335904fce4c3b3.\n.

I'll try again after finishing new api implementation.\n. Is that tutorial still needed? Now if you use official keys, mentions tab will become activities tab automatically. \n. fixed in 0501 release.\n. Seems fixed now, closing.\n. Closing this because implemented now.\n. @screenname will be displayed first when this option disabled, not nickname.\n. This should work now.\n. Now all possible images are loaded through https. If you find somewhere to change, fell free to reopen or open another issue.\n. Does newest version works?\n. OK, I'll close this issue. If problem occurs, feel free to open another issue.\n. Each tweet has its own state corresponding to account, like favorite, retweet. So currently it's not possible. Also merging tweets into one is very slow, which is inacceptable on mobile devices.\n. could you please provide more detailed information about this problem?\n. Try newest beta builds in \"release\" section, that should be supported.\nSohalt notifications@github.com\u4e8e2015\u5e746\u67084\u65e5\u5468\u56db 18:50\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\nIt would be nice to be able to use twitters new feature to add a\ncommentary to a retweet.

Still can't reproduce on current version. I'll release a new version soon, please see whether it works.\n. Now original tweet will be displayed as a clickable link, you can go to original tweet and favorite it.\n. Dup to #170.\n. It already does when you click \"share\" icon in a tweet detail view.\n. This should work now.\n. fixed in recent commits.\n. Now it is possible to retweet with different accounts by long clicking retweet icon.. dup to #177 \n. dup to #177 #180 .\n. @smalltock it's technically the same and fixed in 0.3.0-dev150626 and newer.\n. Is your tinezone settings in your phone right?\n. I added an error report for this before. After rewrote date parsing component, I found there's no further reports after 33db1f5d19c264f5c21f4731d207e96b56c13b62. You could update to dev150903 version and see again, that should fix date problem.\n. This should get fixed now.\n. Should work now.\n. added in ca477ade606e17142a4087616bc62cbefb7a6dfa.\n. fixed in 01cfec55ddef18f6779a5d7fb8ff62ee38adaf42\n. Nice, I'll consider adding this.\n. Move to #51. We can make twitter-style thread feature.. @xiashali \u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\n. Fixed.\n. added in 641a61cb659eabbaf607e45d76e7c034e0abfb98.\nHowever I suggest you not enable this feature, cause I broke one of my phones' volume key before.\n\n@raumzeit77 You can navigate to top quickly with double tap to a tab.\n. Done in 3.1.3.1.\n. fixed in recent versions.\n. Twitter requires user authentication for each requests, so a Twitter account is necessary.\n. fixed in 63eb236c54ea14d9b746996b39e9cb9f84977d75.\n. added in f2fe2c7a5dad8f58f1a51d5c8f3679372b993020.\n.

This should work now.\n. fixed in 6f3d7af4c082e647975aff4f89da75e26846bf86.\n. This should be fixed in recent versions.\n. I guess you forgot to set your application's permission to Read, Write and Direct Messages:\n\nThen you need to sign in again.\n. Media tweets are not available for third party clients. You could try these keys though.\n. It's indeed a pain, I'm still figuring how to make content slide also work for this drawer.\n. It should work now.\n. Try login with these keys, media timeline will be available.\n. @LeonTheOriginal Twitter doesn't have media timeline API exposed to third party apps, so Twidere uses search API and filter results, which has some restrictions.\n. Hi, this bug is caused by wrong image downloader and file cache code. Newest update (2015-10-10) may help\n. @blinry I tried but found nothing problem here. Could you provide some example and some details like your OS version?\n. This code was abandoned and requires a full rewrite, closing for now..

Twidere will keep current design to build minimalistic experience.\n. OK, I'll add an entry to \"Share\" menu.\n. changed in 3417fc68d4da3ed6c1e0dff5798dcaf252f0ba8b.\n.

What's your OS version?\n. fixed in 75c21cdf51f37270e4a4814b0eec19441eeeda09\n. This should get fixed in recent versions.\n. Fixed in recent versions.\n. Could you provide your search query? I'll try to reproduce.\n. Hi @haary, you could try https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/0.3.0-dev151214 to see whether it works.\n. Is this still happen?\n. there're newer versions like dev160131\n. I followed your search query and tried to save, it works. Have you set custom API?\n. Hi, could you show a screenshot to those toast? I can't find what went wrong.\n. I guess it's an issue related to your Xposed module (or somewhat) modding your toasts. Could you give me the address to that module?\n. What should it be on a normal dark theme?\n. Are these problems still exist?\n. Close since media style changed.\n. Are you using proxy or custom API server? Seems related to gzip compression.\n. Fixed in recent commits, you will now be able to open who favorited/retweeted your tweet when clicking activity cards.\n. This should work now.\n. Now twidere will select your own username by default if replying to self.\n. \n. \u539f\u56e0\u5927\u81f4\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\u5728\u4fee\u6539hosts entry\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u6e05\u9664\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8bf7\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4eca\u5929\u7684snapshot\n. fixed in recent versions.\n. Fixed in recent versions.\n. I won't integrate in-app browser feature, because in-app browser has different cookie/cache storage, which makes unnecessary network usages.\nI would suggest Link bubble instead, it's the best alternative for in-app browsers.\n. I'm closing this issue. If you need in-app browser alternative, just use link bubble, it's way better than any in-app browsers.\n. Not possible yet. Twidere itself doesn't implement any kind of push notifications.\n. It'd be possible if you are using official keys since 0.3.0-dev151214. System-wide notifications will follow.\n. 'Activities about me' should work, while 'Activities by friends' may not work properly.\n. I think newest version has unread count, maybe you could try snapshots?\n. I remembered release version and snapshots has same signature, are you using f-droid versions?\n. I think this issue has been fixed in later commits.\n. What kind of tab doesn't show unread count?\n. I tried clean install without any configuration, and still unable to reproduce. Have you enable it in Settings - Scrapyard?\n. Could you show screencast or something? I'm not sure what goes wrong.\n. Hi, could you provide crash log?\n. Those should be fixed. I'll reopen or create another issue when problem persists.\n. I thinks it's not ideal to align actions icon, but it would be improved a little bit since I use \"1 K\" or \"1 M\" for larger numbers.\n. Should work now.\n. @edent I fixed name displaying, can you help me check are there anything displayed incorrectly?\n. Some providers are hard to implement. for a example, fetching Instagram video requires user authentication, which is ridiculous on a Twitter client.\n. @andy-twosticks It maybe requires an extra API call to tumblr to fetch type and preview.\n. @vinzv Done! d7e14a0d028f9c7f138f4c363992cfbdda33861b\n. @Taknamay webm is video right?\n. @Taknamay I'll implement twitter's trunked upload later, if GS has compatible API, it sure will be available too.\n. Could you show me screenshot of API settings?\n. Please try this version https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.0.2-SNAPSHOT-160209\n. I guess https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.0.3 will fix this issue. I received many positive feedback of this version. Can you try this version? Remember not to open 'Custom DNS resolver'.\n. Fine! I'm closing this. \n. @kpj104 What version do you have?\n. Can you invite me to this friendica node? I'll test if possible.\n. @strk My email address is mariotaku.lee at gmail.com, please send me your instance URL.\n. I'm planning to increment version code in 0.3.0 version.\n. Yes, it's a serious bug across all devices, but I haven't find a way to fix. I'd pay for this bugfix if anyone can.\n. :+1:\n.

Twitter shuts down 'activities by friends' API, so this feature won't available.\n. Debug build issue, closing.\n. 1. Yes, this is an intended behavior, Twidere took part in an research program by Tsinghua University. It will get your cached location (so don't worry about battery drain)\n2. If you don't want your location be used, you can go to Settings - Other - Usage Statistics to turn it off.\n3. When I looked into my code, I found it doesn't disable location query when turn usage statistics off, this will get fixed in next commit.\n. Proguard issue, closing\n. I'll see if 3.0.2 fixes.\n. Please try this version https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.0.2-SNAPSHOT-160209\n. Are you using custom API or something?\n. I think this is the same bug to #280.

Dup to #280, I'm moving discussion to that thread.\n. Added in 1eada0f0721215d65c653e4c8dee7f8f44269938.\n. Can you provide log for crashing?\n. @ralesk try use Google variation from releases and it will send report automatically.\n. implemented in 7a77a25452b482ad02ef7e23303724903594d702\n. This is an official only feature. To use it (read and vote only), you will need https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786.\n. implemented in 680deb22c5f14ab7a2ef933e90dc1a5e8d9ecf99\n. should fix now.\n. If twitter has an API for that, I'll try to implement.\n. @art1fa No, Twitter doesn't even has such API for official clients. I'm closing this issue.\n. I added some instances: https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/blob/16201b814214f8d0b5def6fff02a43b3ef95a4f6/twidere/src/main/assets/data/default_api_configs.json\nIf you need more instances, feel free to open an issue, I'll try sign up and obtain a key, or contact site admin.\n. Here's a snapshot version. https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.0.5-SNAPSHOT-160213 Please try this.\n. There should be indeed, activities = interactions.\n. Seems activities by friends is not yet implemented. I'll open another issue\n. Fixed.\n. activity/by_friends was removed by twitter.\n. Should be fixed in recent versions.\n. https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits It's rate limit by Twitter, I can't do anything for this.\nYou can use https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 for consumer key/secret to bypass rate limits though.\n. Not only for GNU social, but also for people using Twitter API proxy like twip.\n. Closing since better way to use StatusNet specific API was implemented\n. I'm planning to add a field to indicate an account's type (twitter, gs, friendica etc), and add separate char limit or something else.\n. Done! This will be available in next release.\n. Can you provide further information? Like system version, logcat etc.\n. @ftpur It helps, can you give me logs containing AndroidRuntime? this will include crash information.\n. Found it! this will be fixed in next release.\n. I won't change default option since it can be changed. But I'll move this to Settings - Cards.\n. Fixed in earlier commits.\n. Fixed in 78e54412938ca27c60e5e73bf8449bd11f74cf2f .\n. Are you using 3.0.4 version? This is a known bug and fixed in beta versions. They will be released very soon.\n. It's an intended behavior, you can easily navigate through pages, like view another tweet while viewing a user or an image.\nI'll add an option for that.\n. Added in bf2296169b8d1fc5cdf971746e9a99ee120202cb\n. It this solved for you? I provided an option to disable NEW_DOCUMENT flag.\n. Ummm, android.content.Intent (~~fog~~\nSo I'm closing this issue, if you need further help feel free to reopen or create another issue.\n. Can you provide more problematic tweet links? I'm finding common things between those images.\n. What kind filters do you have? Keywords or users?\n. I guess you are trying to filter out favorited notifications? It's not yet implemented yet.\n. Fixed in d52983aef442641d19c8a415b2e87750ae6e6f58\n. Oh it's a silly bug I've made... sorry for inconvenience! \n. dup to #81. Seems this feature is obsolete. Feel free to reopen if Twitter make this someday.. I'll merge by hand since changes are made in develop branch, thanks!\n. Yep.\n. I can't reproduce that, could you provide a screenshot?\n. @muamma oh, they're saved searches. You can list/remove them in your profile page \n. Fixed in 43af801b6cd708148f9d191f33391b1168a730d1. It's actually a intended behavior in okhttp3 which falls back to direct connection when no proxy available.\n. New version will be available through releases link.\n. Thanks!\n. fixed in d9f7ac3a84011cb78e4dae78e9463c1b2c55f56f.\n. \u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9blogcat\u5417\uff1f\n. Should work now.\n. F-Droid checks for master branch, once merged to master, F-Droid will do their job, which is not part of my business.\nIf you want to try new versions, you can find in GitHub releases, but since they're signed by me, you'll need to uninstall F-Droid one first. I asked if they can publish APKs built by me also, seems still need to wait.\n. Yes, this was removed since it's really not safe by trusting all certificates on all websites. Whitelisted cert management will follow.\n. Are you using Let's Encrypt certificate? Use\nssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.awesome.domain/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.awesome.domain/privkey.pem;\ninstead of\nssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.awesome.domain/cert.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.awesome.domain/privkey.pem;\nWill ensure cert working on any application.\nAlso configuration below is acting like a Twitter API server, without any other requirement.\n```\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name  your.awesome.domain;\nssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.awesome.domain/fullchain.pem;\nssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.awesome.domain/privkey.pem;\n\nlocation ~ ^/domain.([\\w\\d]+)/(.*) {\n    resolver 8.8.8.8;\n    proxy_pass  https://$1.twitter.com/$2$is_args$args;\nproxy_cookie_domain twitter.com $server_name;\n}\n\nlocation / {\n    root /var/www/your.awesome.domain;\n}\n\n}\n``\n. @raidenii Could you send me your API address via email? I'll investigate what caused this problem.\n. If problem still exists, try turn http2 on nginx off for this host, I'm not sure if newest nginx works.. Added an activity indicator to gaps. . Closing this issue, if this problem regressed, feel free to reopen or make a new issue..

I can't reproduce this issue, does it still not working on newer versions?\n. I tried to set 'load item limit' to 200 and refresh on start seems worked without problem. I'll try release 3.1.3, please see if it works.\n. Groups API is too poorly documented, I still need time to figure that out.\n. I implemented group view/timeline feature, managing a group is not implemented yet.\n. Most features like timeline/members is working. Feel free to open new issues to this feature.. Seems an upstream bug of Android Support Library, will fix when patch come out, please keep this issue open.\n. should work with new versions\n. I guess this was fixed in newer version, if you find issue exists, feel free to reopen.. It's not a good idea I think, installing beta as another application is confusing.\n. I have talked with f-droid maintainers for choosing signature, we're planning to use my apk on f-droid in the future, or provide two apks. This would help.\n. Added in 14559e576edc4cd2dc6a757a4d23ff5aae4352f4\n. confirmed.\n. dup to #403 \n. @rhacius Does it still crashing with new versions?\n. Merged intodevelopbranch c62c58422ec5d7486d15fe5ef0da7cdd9b4130fb.\n. It should work for recent commits.\n. @annando That option was removed because now Twidere will get text limit automatically.\n. Does it have native API for getting thread? I can use that.\n. I support/statusnet/conversation/{id}.json`, but it seems returns 404 in quitter.se.\n. Seems working fine in 3.1.0+\n\n. Have you tried remove and add tab? I can't reproduce this bug.\n. Thanks for your translation, app name 'Twidere' is not translatable.\n. I made app name string translatable now, so closing this issue.\n. Fixed in 5cc46bc49e773d86f7a7c8ce472446f9b3e04b3f.\n. Are you doing a clean build? I can't find any error.\n. Which version? Newest version should open correct link.\n. Oh, I know, open a tweet link inside a status in GS is not working yet, I'll improve twitter link handler in the future.\n. @annando Yep, that's how text limit works.\n@benediktg Maybe you could try re-add your account?\n.

There's an option called Bandwidth saving mode in network preferences, which automatically turns off media preview when you are using metered network (like 3g or mobile hotspot)\n. I still can't reproduce... not sure why.\n. What's your JDK version?\n. @annando For public instances only.\n. @MarcusMoeller @kameleono It's pretty simple, just register an app called Twidere with read-write-directmessage permission (or your desired brand name) and send consumer key/secret to me, I'll do the rest.\nDefault settings for example:\n\n. @vinilox Hi, could you register with your account? Since you're the admin, the key should work whatever I signed up in your instance or not.\n.

I'll add it in 3.1.3.1.\n. Sorry, I forgot to update translations, it will be available in 3.1.3.2, and will release this week.\n. Released, I'm closing this.\n. It's a bug in 3.1.4, and has been fixed in 3.1.4.1+, it should be available now.\n. Have you tried login with browser? The web icon in sign in screen.\n. Can you make changes on develop branch?\n. Could you make a new PR base on latest develop branch?\n. Fixed in 6c1623ce.\n. Different account has different color as you set them in Drawer - 'Accounts' - Long click and choose 'Set color', then you'll see its color label on the right side of a tweet.\n. 1. Different tweet has their different state, like rt/favorite count, so I use multiple tweet by design\n2. Liking a tweet will be performed by its corresponding account.\n. I suggest using https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 for full interactions. There's no API for who liked our tweet.. Should work after #709, feel free to open another issue if problem persists.. #709 Should fix this, feel free to open new issue if this still exists.. This feature is not available unless you found a consumer key/secret from official client.\n. Ah, my bad, confirmed. Will fix soon.\n. Do you mean via push notification? Twidere doesn't have push yet.\n. It's not meant to be published, just some code changes for extensions.\n. Indeed, Twitter doesn't even allows us to access group DMs at all. I'll try some special method though. Please wait for upcoming changes.\n. See #709, closing this issue for better tracking. Thanks, please submit translations here later.\n. I'll update. Are you a native Spanish speaker? I can give you higher permission to modify existing translations here\n. Have you enabled read from bottom? The behavior you've mentioned was made by design if that option enabled.\n. Thanks, I've noticed that and will implement ASAP.\n. That's the 'Navigate Up' action should be, see https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html .\n. - [x] View\n- [x] Respond\n- [ ] Create\n\nThis could be done by official keys. @rugk Have you changed to official keys?. This is due to Twitter's limitation. It doesn't provide such an API to fetch favorited users to a tweet.. However this could be done by https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 .. No, it's only possible to change email/phone number in official app or website.\n. Yes, it requires https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 to work, once you changed your keys and re-login, full notifications will work.. Thanks. Please make pull request on develop in the future.\n. Have you installed Google Play Services and Android M2repository properly?\n. I guess this has been fixed. Feel free to reopen when problem still persists.. Card UI doubles layout code to maintain, so it was removed.\n. Fixed in dce0739d154206de3655fa1903c1134317bc14d4.\n. Added in aa6f13ae5d3d215345a76509720452c5dc0b9628.\n. #709 Should fix this, feel free to open new issue if this still exists.. I guess this is an intended behavior, cause notifications was configured to only alert once.\njava\n/**\n * Set this flag if you would only like the sound, vibrate\n * and ticker to be played if the notification is not already showing.\n */\npublic Builder setOnlyAlertOnce(boolean onlyAlertOnce). Now this was fixed in 3.2.5.\nI added a feature to let Twidere get remote config, media link will be counted by default, but when Twitter really rolls new mechanism out, I'll push a new config so all previous versions will work correctly. \n.

I received several reports about moto g database corruption . It seems an OS problem or even hardware problem. I've made accounts stores in system framework, this will prevent Twidere from logged out when bad things on database happened, but tabs and tweets will still be cleared..

New tweetdeck style add/remove dialog will be available in next version\n\n. See #538 . dup to #607\n. Though I guess it's technically possible, I believe Twitter wouldn't be happy if Twidere has that. Closing since I don't have any plan for this.. It's material theme already, though can't be 100% materialized since older Android platforms lacks of features.\n. Does it working now? I tried in latest version and it seems fine.. There's no API for third party clients showing favorite status.\n\nFor official keys: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. If a tweet starts with D or M, Twitter will interpret it as a direct message.\nhttps://twittercommunity.com/t/cant-tweet-starting-with-certain-letters-words-post-statuses-update-json-interprets-sms-commands/50126/5. Most of links can be handled now I believe. If you find some link should be opened in Twidere while it's not, feel free to reopen.. @jingofett Your request is a bit off-topic, besides, it's not possible to have an action item on a tab bar. . Currently translation is only available through official keys.\nhttps://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786\n. Chrome custom tab may be a good way, I'll consider add that.\n. You can select 'Copy Link' in 'Share' menu currently if you are using Marshmallow and above. I'll consider add this to older platforms.\n. Does GS have special API for that? I can make an some detection logic for commenting on GS.\n. @moshpirit Thanks, I tried to find their newest API docs but seems kinda outdated, it would be nice if we can find a new one, then I can make more improvements for GNU social/StatusNet.\n. Parsing text isn't a good way since it fails in different locale or different service configurations, I would prefer GS-specific notifications/activities/interactions API, I'll implement soon if I can find related API.\nIf this feature isn't exist yet on GS, we could contact their developer and discuss about that.\n. You could use color label feature.\nTap on any user you want, select it's menu and find 'Set color', and you can pick a color for this user. There will be a color strip for their tweet.\n. Sorry, I'm closing this issue because its use case is very limited. There're already profile avatar, name, screen name for a tweet, which is enough.. Can you tweet other content? You can email me your unsent tweet secretly to help me investigate this issue. mariotaku.lee at gmail.com\n. Did GS have mute feature? Maybe I should hide this entry for GS services.\n. I did thought about built-in account manager, but it has a huge drawback - it's name based, which is bad when handling multiple account type, especially same name from different providers.\n. Hmm, I guess screen_name@provider could do the job. I'll post my thoughts about this feature in this issue and implement in the future maybe.\n. For all StatusNet accounts, display screen_name@server.domain.name\nFor all Twitter accounts, display screen_name@twitter\nFor all Fanfou accounts, display screen_name@fanfou\n. Could you provide problematic GS server link? I can't reproduce yet.. Seems working in 3.4.22+, feel free to reopen if problem still exists.. I guess it's more like system problem, so closing unless problem resurfaced on stable CM builds.. I don't have a valid number for receiving SMS auth code, so I'll put this issue on hold. Please keep this issue open until I fix it or problem disappeared.. Scrolling performance got a lot better after image loader changed.. It's impossible to display likes and RTs unless we use official keys.. Official keys should work, I'll check that out. @ldmosquera is Twitter for Android key works?. F-Droid variant strips out all closed source components like Google Map and Crashlytics, though most features will get an open source alternative instead, some features will be not available since no alternative.. Could you explain more about this issue?. @gena01 Where did you get this problem, home/interactions timeline or custom timeline?. @gena01 If you getting \"Can't load earlier tweets\" on some gaps older than ~4 hours, then it was caused by Twitter's 800 tweets limit.. @gena01 Which problem do you get, gap disappeared or \"Can't load earlier tweets\"?. @morinap Home timeline/interactions should work fine now, while list timeline sometime still have this problem which is harder to tackle.. I can't reproduce that, that's your tab type?. Still can't reproduce. If you have procedure reproducing that, I'll reopen.. So weird and I don't know why. What's your locale?. @edent It's an incident caused by https://crowdin.com/profile/Vip9300Vip .\nThis user translated Twidere's app name, I've blocked this user and restored translation. A new update will release soon.. Fixed in 8685437b8539cab730759e9d68b17464ea85db5b, if problem still exists, feel free to reopen.. Fixed in 3.3.24.. I'll add a confirmation for new users in future releases.. Once it has twitter or StatusNet compatible API, I'll consider.. Since Twidere become compatible to multiple microblogging platforms, support to Gab.ai will be planned once they provide stable API access.. This is configurable, check out Settings - Content - New Document API.\nOn Sun, Dec 18, 2016, 06:55 rugk notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSo that is the sense of it?\nIf so I have nothing against making it configurable.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/662#issuecomment-267792407,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAyrlkjjaPXq-CEHOyIVHTagmhdNr1f5ks5rJGh8gaJpZM4LP_n_\n.\n. @orithena Great idea! I will use this name from now on.. Is this working on 3.4+ version?. OK, if the problem happens on new version, feel free to reopen this issue.. Twidere needs an icon for both Android and (upcoming iOS) version, also an icon shouldn't be easily changed across major updates. I'll try adjust this icon for a little bit later.. After migrating to ExoPlayer2, this issue should be fixed, also video plays instantly once it begins loading.. Confirmed and done! This will be closed automatically when changes pushed to master branch.. It's some enhanced (paid) features currently in beta, is it downloaded from Google Play Store?. This entry will be removed from F-Droid first until I find some truly open source payment method.\n\nFree doesn't means free of charge, but don't worry, I'll keep F-Droid variant 100% open sourced without any single line of propertiary library.\nBTW 3.3.35 is a pre-release, does f-droid have some way to use code from master branch only?. Are you using official keys or built in Twidere keys?. @wynnsyt Sure, I filtered those unsupported tweet out in recent commits. . ~~I tested with Chrome and it works fine. Maybe Firefox can't handle it correctly?~~\nIt's a bug indeed, and now fixed correctly.. After some quick test, I found Twitter's \"/search/tweets.json\" API can't handle protected user properly. That's not Twidere issue. I'll improve that situation for official app keys though.. Do you have more information like screenshots?. Is 3.3.42 works for you?. @wynnsyt I guess this issue is for GNU social.. Yes, there'll be an option for turning tablet mode on/off.. Do you mean a tab of your lists, or a tab of list timeline?. This is a great idea, you'll see this in next release.. I made some changes for this issue in 3.4.4 version, let's see if it works.. How many lists do you have?. @diesocke Twitter has their rate limit, usually you can only call 'add user to a list' function 15 times per 15 minutes window, the same to removing a user, so it will easily reach their limit. However you can try this: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. I'll provide an option later to turn on/off tablet UI, switch between single-column and multi-column, let's track working progress in #682 .. https://medium.com/@v.danylo/implementing-video-playback-in-a-scrolled-list-listview-recyclerview-d04bc2148429#.8d36p45qw\n. Dropped because it's performance impact. Dup to #570.. @nguyenhoan \nQ1: no\nQ2: supports newer API\nQ3: n/a\nQ4: no. OOME could happen everywhere due to insufficient runtime memory. Closing this issue.. Reload? Do you mean force close?. Twidere can add support for other social platforms, as long as basic requirements met (users/status objects with unique id). It won't too hard technically speaking, however it would be a rather huge work to do. I'm willing to accept PRs that add Mastodon support. . So here's what we need to support Mastodon:\n- [x] OAuth 2 authorization (easy, a header is enough)\n- [x] Login flow\n- [x] Mastodon specific account info\n- [x] Mastodon objects (Posts, Users...)\n- [ ] Mastodon API (See Twitter API for example, just need to annotate some interfaces)\n- [x] Utility classes converts Mastodon object to Twidere's ParcelableXXX object\nGuys, since I have something else to do (iOS version and my work and my school works), could anyone help me doing tasks I've mentioned above? This can help this feature finished sooner.. I really should've give up any hope that anyone will help me with this feature. Is arguing about API more productive than implementing some features that can be done within 3 days?. What still needs to be done:\n- [x] Edit profile\n- [x] Follow/block/mute\n- [x] Set visibility for status\n- [x] Ensure account color set (by adding toParcelable(AccountDetails) maybe?). I guess this can be marked as done. Please test 3.5.23 version and help me to make sure every function is working properly. . @Lertsenem \n\nnot only apostrophes, but line breaks are not properly rendered too\n\n779\n\nreplying to a toot does not use the user full handle (only the username, not the instance), so the mentions cannot work out of the box for external users\n\n776. @MightyPork\n\nnotifications and the like say 'tweet' instead of 'toot'\n\nYes, this is because Twidere still uses Twitter's writing style, it will make text needed to translate multiplied if we add text for platforms respectively\n\nthe reply box has a 140 char limit (click 'reply' on a toot)\n\nYou can set account color in 'Accounts' list.\n\n\"network public\" timeline is not federated, but also local\n\n777\n\napostrophes and maybe other things show as HTML entities\n\n773\n\ngetting lots of duplicate notifications\n\n770\n\ntimelines don't seem to want to update unless I pull down\n\n753\n\nthe hashtag tab is always empty\n\nOK, I'll consider making this tab not added by default when a user login to mastodon instances \n\nthe DMs tab for some reason shows DMs from Twitter\n\nMastodon doesn't have DM feature yet.. # Please, open separate issues rather than commenting here to make sure they get tracked respectively . @cyphar 'Direct' statuses in Mastodon still should be treated as status, because they mixed in notifications timeline. I'll make this DM conversation style only when it have related API to do that.. @cyphar Yeah, Mastodon's 'Direct' mentions are still not private enough since recipients may not respect this visibility.. 1. I've added alt_text to each media image's content description, making screen reader apps like TalkBack can read it for visually impaired people. For UI design perspective, I don't think it's a very good idea to make alt text visible to everyone.\n2. This is located in that edit icon in compose dialog, you can click and edit alt text.\n\n . I'll add alt_text to \"load media\" button's contentDescription.. I guess this issue is already known. We have snapshot build 3.4.28, could you try this version? You can find apk here in releases section.. No problem, if you encountered any issues, feel free to leave comment here.. I guess this was fixed in recent versions, feel free to reopen if issue persists.. By 'retweet', do you mean quote retweet or retweet without any comments?. Seems we need to concern about security issues for this feature. This issue doesn't mean we will implement this actually.. Is this version work for you? https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.4.32\nHaven't uploaded yet since it has some compatibility issues with pre-lollipop devices.. Seems mentions were sorted alphabetically by mistake, I'll investigate.. Now mentions are not sorted alphabetically anymore, they sorted by order they appeared in a tweet instead.. @Yowlen This fix was pushed after 3.4.48, and will be available in next release.. There's no server implementation found for video proxying. I'd be glad to add support if there's one.. I got an even better idea, that is to make reverse proxy work for all network requests. I'll implement in future versions.. Config example\nlocation ~ ^/(http|https)/([^/]+)/(.*) {\n        resolver 8.8.8.8;\n        proxy_pass $1://$2/$3$is_args$args;\n        proxy_cookie_domain ~.* $server_name;\n        proxy_cookie_path $uri /$2/uri;\n        proxy_buffering off; # Turn off buffer in order to get stream as-is\n        proxy_set_header Host $2;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1; # This was necessary!!!\n    }. No, please refer to documentation below:\nSupported patterns\n\n[SCHEME]: E.g. http or https\n[HOST]: Host address\n[PORT]: Port number\n[AUTHORITY]: [HOST]:[PORT] or [HOST] if port is default. Colon will be URL encoded\n[PATH]: Raw path part, without leading slash\n[/PATH]: Raw path part, with leading slash\n[PATH_ENCODED]: Path, will be URL encoded again\n[QUERY]: Raw query part\n[?QUERY]: Raw query part, with ? prefix\n[QUERY_ENCODED]: Raw query part, will be URL encoded again\n[FRAGMENT]: Raw fragment part\n[#FRAGMENT]: Raw fragment part, with # prefix\n[FRAGMENT_ENCODED]: Raw fragment part, will be URL encoded again\n[URL_ENCODED]: URL Encoded url itself\n[URL_BASE64]: Base64 Encoded url itself\n\nNull values\n[PATH], [/PATH], [QUERY], [?QUERY], [FRAGMENT], [#FRAGMENT] will be empty when\nit's null, values and base64-encoded will be string \"null\".\nA valid format looks like\nhttps://proxy.com/[SCHEME]/[AUTHORITY]/[PATH][?QUERY][#FRAGMENT],\nA request\nhttps://example.com:8080/path?query=value#fragment\nWill be transformed to\nhttps://proxy.com/https/example.com%3A8080/path?query=value#fragment\n. @lixingcong https://github.com/mariotaku/twidere/wiki/Reverse-Proxy permalink of this document will be located here.\nP.S. Twidere will send basic Proxy-Authorization header to your proxy server, you can handle on your server side.. @lixingcong I forgot to mention, seems it can't cooperate well with Thumbor.. @lixingcong No, Proxy-Authorization isn't a standard for reverse proxies, maybe you'll need to configure nginx to consume this header, or use some classic way like add a random path like proxy.com/R4ND0M/[SCHEME]/.... This was fixed in 3.4.39.. Yep, this will be added in the future.. @franciscojunior Feel free to create a new issue about this, it's a good idea.. Can you grab logcat tagged with 'AndroidRuntime'?\nUsage: adb logcat -s AndroidRuntime. @rugk Thanks, but this log is incomplete. Grab by logcat -s AndroidRuntime to get crashes rather than logcat | grep -i twidere. If you believe your log contains private information, you can remove parts not start with Process: org.mariotaku.twidere, PID: ?????. Is the account that has notifications enabled in 'Accounts' list?. Notification is now yet clickable indeed, and will be fixed soon. . Can you check your DM tab configuration? Settings - Tabs, it should be 'Activated accounts'. This is really strange. Maybe we need to dig further. Let's communicate by\nemail. I'll send you a debug build so you can provide more information.

Can you grab logcat about this crash? adb logcat -s AndroidRuntime will print out log required.. @mamins1376 This did help. I fixed this in earlier commits, and it will be available soon.. @iknownothingaboutcomputers Not sure if it's related, could you provide a logcat?. @iknownothingaboutcomputers Some tab has immutable account configuration, since they relies heavily on account information, thus can't be changed once created.. Have you noticed the color strip on the right of a tweet/dialog? It indicates which account you're currently using. Also by long-clicking on retweet/fav button you'll be able to select account.. This was known in #730 and fixed in f3ebbc3.. Done!. Done! Now when adding a list timeline, it will show your lists first.. Could you provide logcat? adb logcat -s AndroidRuntime Will print out all information needed.. Confirmed. It's a bug in data caching.. Have you removed your own @ username? It's a behavior change caused by Twitter's new 140 characters reply.. I've tried replying to self without removing @ username, it sent as a reply without problem, in addition, my own @ username was not appearing in that reply.. @Yowlen Yeah I know, it's an intended behavior. I'll add an explanation under composing text for that case.. @Yowlen Yes it is. Technically speaking new form of reply doesn't contains any @ mentions, all users mentioned before will be mentioned in this reply by default.\n\nThe worst thing is, you can't remove original tweet user's mention without losing in_reply_to data anymore, so the only way removing tweet user's @ username without losing context is to use quote tweet.\nHowever, as you can see, existing mentions in a reply doesn't count in 140 characters. Also when you mentioning your self, seems Twitter will automatically remove @ username for you.. @Yowlen So, my suggestion is, when replying to your own tweet, there's no need to remove @ mention anymore, since it doesn't count in 140 characters, and doesn't show @ username at the beginning of the tweet actually.. @Yowlen Yep - this affects all replies, Twidere actually uses some magic text parsing method to mimic old style mentions, though Twitter's new reply doesn't use @ mentions at all.. @kathakatze When tweet user removed, you'll be able to see a label indicating this reply will be sent as a quote in next version.. @Yowlen I don't know what they are think about, all I can do is trying hard to bring good old Twitter experience back.. @Yowlen @kathakatze Made @ mentions a little bit grey. I guess this will help people distinguish.\n\n. Most pages can be accessed via side menu, if you really have that much page, performance may be impacted a lot. I'll keep current tab design untouched.. Duplicate to #712. You expect notifications not showing twice after cleared right? I made some change, which may help. @rugk new version's coming out, is this version solved your problem?. This is not possible because Twitter UserStream doesn't provide poll data, even with official keys.. @grawlinson Thanks, I'll report violation immediately. . @orithena Hope a DMCA takedown I just sent would help.. @FlorentAnders I'll close this issue as it should be solved. Remember, do the right thing.. @FlorentAnders I'm not sure what account you're referring to, If you mean Google Play, since you've removed violations, other apps developed by you should be fine.. I just published 3.5.0, let's see if this helps.\nIt changed the way it receives network change events.. Still not able to reproduce at all, is it because I use a Nexus device without any root or modifications?. @regagain I'll reopen this as you wish, if I can reproduce, I'll try investigate and fix ASAP.. I guess it's more like Twidere being killed for some reason, then it cannot\nrefresh messages.

I found the root cause of this bug. Will fix soon!. Confirmed and fixed in 3.5.9, it's caused by a Nougat-only api invocation.. @jasonmacduffie Does they have such API for network timeline?. It's an intended behavior actually, Twidere will limit its data to a user set maximum, e.g 300, this will be performed each time Twidere closed. I improved to make it perform only when Twidere quits, rather than rotating screen.. This will get better after d9068de. Old tweets get removed only when you quits Twidere. This is essential to prevent performance issues.. This is confirmed as a bug. I'll take a look to it.. Done! This was released in beta channel, hope it works without problem.. Old way always load 2:1 banner, causes banner to be cropped twice when aspect ratio is larger than 2:1. I improved this in ea924cb. When you're in landscape mode, the profile banner will load that one with 3:1 aspect ratio.. Done! New version will be available in beta channel very soon.. This was a duplicate to #763. You'll see the fix in 3.5.18.. Thanks! I've removed this field and it will be available in next version.. @LukasThyWalls What browser do you have?. @LukasThyWalls Is 3.5.27 fixed this issue?. @LukasThyWalls What's your expected behavior? I can't fully understand your description.. @LukasThyWalls \"Chrome custom tabs\" still respects system browser settings because some browsers like Opera also have this feature.

No. This is a TweetDeck only feature.\nStefan Brand notifications@github.com\u4e8e2017\u5e744\u670819\u65e5 \u5468\u4e0920:59\u5199\u9053\uff1a\nCan I use the Teams feature\nhttps://support.twitter.com/articles/20172472 in Twidere?

I figured out what happened. Mastodon does not accept true or false for local parameter, it checks existence of local parameter to decide whether show federated timeline or not.. @jbbdude Twidere also work on other platforms, to prevent ambiguity with \"Local (geo-wise) timeline\", this will not change.. Oops, dup to #776 . @Raltux Are you trying to send a tweet to twitter, or toot to mastodon instances?. @z411 Currently Twidere only tries to connect to HTTPS enforced domain, is this the reason?. @z411 My app opened it directly, what's your Twidere version?. @z411 That's OS version then? My phone has 7.1.2.. @z411 So Twidere is too strict on TLS security? I guess I'll respect system config in future version.. This is a duplicate to #770 .\nP.S. Good news! Fixed in 92ab85adf949a1c554825622ef1f077ee3df47a2.. @yiskah Have you make sure this is the right patch? Seems federated and local timeline is working already. Also this patch have syntax errors.. @thegrandvezir I guess \"Quick Action\" is what you want, simply add a \"Quick Action\" and pick user, then you'll be able to add user profile to home screen.. @soaringowl2145 Can you share me some example tweets to that?. I guess this is not possible yet because Twitter and Facebook intentionally blocking each other's access to link details.. You can edit OAuth and server address in sign-in screen. Just click that server button on top right of the screen.. @keverets It's not possible. An OAuth key is needed to be obtained on instance in order to sign in, which is impractical on GNU social because Mastodon gave user an API to fetch such key on client side while GNU social requires me to register an account on every instances, fetch the key, or contact their site owner to obtain one.. @roytam1 Yes it does. However Basic auth is a really bad practice. Though Twidere haven't remove Basic auth yet for some legacy reason, it's still strongly discouraged and will never be default.. Seems Diaspora* doesn't have a client side API yet, for Movim, seems it has completely different protocol and structures. Twidere has platform independent structure for social platforms, so if you know how to link to those instances, fell free to open a pull request.. @fpom Please update to latest version and try, \"&apos;\" encoding should be working since 3.5.27.. This is also a dup to #770 and seems to be fixed. You can try newest builds here: https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/. @fpom Have you selected \"Twitter\" in the dialog popped up in login screen? . @fpom Well this leads to some confuse indeed. You should click \"Default\" to use your settings, I've improved this by adding \"Default\" to its account type to distinguish with built-in one.. I believe #818 is related.. @KillianKemps Have you checked in \"Accounts\" in your sidebar? Account will show in timeline when it gets checked, and tab has \"Activated account\" option.. @muamma After looked into their implementation, I found talon tries to find more tweets at once so I also adjusted Twidere to higher value, which may help. However, honestly speaking it's still incomplete. You may want use this workaround: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. @jdfq \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\n\n\nApp\u7248\u672c\u662f\uff1f\n\u8981\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u8d26\u53f7\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u996d\u5426\u3001Twitter\u3001Mastodon\uff1f\n\u662f\u5426\u51fa\u73b0\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff1f\n\n\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\uff1f. \u627e\u5230\u539f\u56e0\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u591a\u8c22\u62a5\u544a\uff01. @Yowlen do you mean after clicking \"Retweet\" button, tweet it displayed in retweet dialog isn't what you expected?. @Yowlen I've received some same reports about this. Let's sssume we have two tweets A and B.

Thanks!. I found a possible bug to this problem which is included in 3.5.37. Please try and see if it still happens.. I think this issue has been completely fixed. Feel free to reopen if you have this kind of issue again.. So, do you mean when replying to a sensitive toot, this should be also sensitive? . @novadeviator Well I misunderstood this issue. . @eatradish \u70b9\u51fb\u7684\u662fTwitter\u8fd8\u662fDefault\uff1f. @eatradish OK, \u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u548c802\u662f\u540c\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7591\u60d1. Dup to #802. This is a duplicate to #770. Is beta version solved this problem for you?. Migrate to #917 . No. Twidere respects system settings, and adapts to different orientations automatically.. Twidere has external emoji pack support. See https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android-Emoji-Noto and https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android-Emoji-Apple .. @KAMiKAZOW I'll make an extension available on Google Play, rather than bundle into Twidere. Those emoji adds up to several hundreds of megabytes to packages size, which is unacceptable.. @KAMiKAZOW Sorry, not 100+MB. But 29MB is also too large for just a emoji pack.\n\nTo reduce memory usage, we need to scale each vector image into bitmaps for different densities, so it's way larger than single sized bitmaps.. The repo is created https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android-Emoji-Twemoji and releases will be available soon.. They have several ways for doing that, like download when needed, or just use a low-res emoji set for all resolutions. But no, I won't doing that since\n\nDownloading emojis requires a server, and F-Droid variant users doesn't like outgoing connection to servers other than Twitter's.\nTransparent WebP isn't available on all supported system versions\nLow-res emojis looks terrible on newer phones.. Also by implementing this, notifications and auto refresh for custom timelines could be easily implanted. 1. Returning exactly 20 tweets is not guaranteed\nThe last \"Load more\" gap is also a tweet.\nTwitter may not be able to return older tweets after several hours.. @MrReSc I tried and it's still working, you can set this to a higher value in Settings - Contents - Load item limits.. @Canageek Your guess is right, Twidere treats last media link as the end but haven't checked if there're more text. I'll fix this in next commit.. Yes, this is expected and has nothing to do with Twidere. To understand\nwhy, we'll need to know how OAuth work.\n\nTL;DR: Password and app permission are different.\nFull explanation: When you sign in to Twitter using Twidere, it doesn't\nstore your password actually. Instead, it obtains a token with permission\nto some of your Twitter data, for accessing Twitter via API. If you need to\nrevoke Twidere's access, you can go to https://twitter.com/settings/apps .\nDiego de Abreu notifications@github.com\u4e8e2017\u5e745\u670818\u65e5 \u5468\u56db08:36\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\nCheck before submitting issue -- Thank you!\nYou can ignore this form if this issue is a feature request.\nExpected behavior\nWhen the password or username is changed the app should request the\ncredentials again.\nActual behavior\nThe app doesn't request the credentials and keeps showing the old username\nSteps to reproduce\nChange the username or password by twitter website and uses the app after\nthat.\nExtra info\nAndroid version: (version code here)\n5.1.1 LMY47V\nNetwork type:\n\nCellular\nWi-Fi\n\nApp version: (version code here)\n3.6.11\nBuild variant:\n\nGoogle\nF-Droid\n\nMicro-blogging service:\n\nTwitter\nFanfou\nGNU Social / StatusNet\nMastodon\n\nApp settings:\n\nCustom API\nCustom consumer key/secrets\nOfficial keys\nUsing Thumbor https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor\nConnected through proxy\nMedia preview enabled\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/840, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAyrlvdsjj7oXbclqjG5S7Co4FxCK2xLks5r65J7gaJpZM4NemUa\n.\n. Have you change your consumer key/secret?. Thanks, this has been confirmed as a bug.. Notification for user is available only when streaming enabled. Is that work for you?. @levinus I'm planning to make all tabs background-refreshable. In the meantime you can use private list to manage users.. This would be great!. @Yowlen It's not released yet. I've got some build problem so release APK cannot produced yet.. You can add tab for separate account in Settings - Tabs.. @bayang There're too many Mastodon instances. Twidere couldn't handle them all. The better solution I guess is to make they have mastodon: like scheme for apps to handle.. I suggest using automatic tool like ifttt to do that.. Using specialized text for different platforms doubles (or even triples) texts to translate. I'll start this process gradually by making all possible strings more generalize, and use specialized text for the rest part.. @alugarius Calm down. I tried to mention and reply to self several ways, and no notifications indeed -- even official web interface doesn't have that. I'd say it's a bug (or feature?) of Mastodon it self. And I received notifications from others normally.. @alugarius Could you try include your test account's id into your reply and test?. Fixed. . @alugarius I'll push a new version to play store along with other minor fixes.. Federated timeline can't be combined with home timeline. They aren't the same type. If you want to see more toots in your Mastodon timeline, try follow more interested users.. @stormwatch One simple reason, it adds too much complexity to user settings. Though it's easy to implement.. Direct reply is not direct message. Please keep in mind that it's not private at all acrossing instances. I'll add DM for Mastodon once it have real DM feature.. @NekoiNemo Sometimes notifications can't be retrieved (see #855), this was fixed and will be available soon. \n@alugarius Mastodon's direct reply is not DM, if you send this to other GS servers, you'll see it's just normal mentions. I won't give user false sense of privacy to this feature, it's not private at all.. @NekoiNemo \n\n\nhttps://quitter.se/notice/12648861\nAs you can see, this direct reply got retweeted on quitter, so I believe this should never be moved to real DM tab.. @alugarius This is a status sent with 'direct' visibility to user @mariotaku@quitter.se . \nTo reproduce you'll only need to\n\nMention a user in non-Mastodon instance with 'direct' visibility\nCheck your notifications in that instance\nDo anything you want with this status.\n\nIf I move direct reply to DM tab, users will believe this is the 'real' DM. If someone send some private information to non-Mastodon instances, and get retweeted, who's responsible for this?. @alugarius Sharing your DMs to public is different with lacks of privacy protection across instances. Sharing your DMs without permission means you don't have respect to who you're messaging. I'm blocking you from further comments. Goodbye.. Looks like you're on Android Nougat. This is system bahavior. Android groups notifications automatically when an app has more than 4 notifications on the screen. You can dismiss individually by swiping down on this grouped notification and make them expand (or click that arrow to do so). @NekoiNemo Seems they can be separated by type. I'll try this out.. You can now retweet to other instances/accounts by long-tapping on retweet icon. Retweeting to multiple accounts simultaneously is not supported.. @smalltock Got it, this still not supported in details page right? I will try find a way to implement this.. Oh, forgot to mention that this feature is available in details page too.. Migrate to #842. Yes that's normal. Short links can't be expanded without request to shortener service, and don't give metadata for Twitter for showing preview.. It's practically impossible. A single refresh action would make several link expansion requests, this will be a huge impact on refreshing speed. On 4G network, a request takes 100ms at least, if there are 15 links in total, it would take 1.5s while refreshing itself only takes ~300ms.. @novadeviator 3.6.21 should fix this. Try update to newest version?. @Yowlen This will happen on all retweets IIRC. I think you're able to upgrade to 3.6.21 now since it has been released for hours, and available in every regions.. @Yowlen So is it still crashing in 3.6.21? I'll check crash reports and see what happened.. dup to #867 . Please update to newer 3.6.21 version.. Migrated to #885.. So the only thing affects on boosts is visibility flag of a status, despite user's lock settings right?. dup to #867 . What's your system version? This can't be reproduced on Twidere 3.6.21, Android 8.0.. I'll make this special case for Mastodon. I think this should be also supported on server side. . This is a duplicate to #867. F-Droid somehow stopped update and I'm not able to trigger its build.. This is a duplicate to #867.. Seems this problem was caused by a silly bug by me, hopefully previous commit can fix this problem!. @Yowlen @nbara https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.6.22 I've made a release including fix to this issue, please check out.. @gimbar I feel sorry for your experience. Twidere is working on a full rewrite, as far as I can tell, scrolling performance has improved to a whole new level.. Seems it's IPv6 related problem:\n\n. I'm pretty sure TLS are enforced correctly, but error still remains. See https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-java/issues/298 .. Fixed along with #835 .. Color in user profile page is displayed on the left side, while account color on the right side can be changed in Accounts by long-clicking an account.. User color can be set through tweet page, or user page (that page when you clicked profile image).\n\nleft pane > Accounts > short-tap an account > top-right menu > Define color\n\nThis opened user page, and sets user color. In order to set account color, you'll need to long-tap an account and Twidere will bring up a list dialog for you.. @SlashTray Yeah, Twidere calls account belongs to others as 'user'. BTW you can choose 'Clear' when set color for a user to remove the color you've previously set.. TL;DR: Those permissions are used by Twidere for accessing those data from Twitter, and present them for you. Twidere itself won't use these data for any other purposes.\nFull version: See @orithena 's comment.. Can you give me your Twitter id? I'll adjust QR code style and make sure your QR code can be scanned correctly.. You can either compile manually or wait for a new release on beta channel soon.. Do you mean Notification Badges?. @thatguyhex This will be supported soon, since Twidere is working on integrating brand-new notification channels.. Have you tried swipe up? I saw your \"Tech\" list after swiping up to load more.. I can't reproduce. Are you replying to a retweet or something?. This has been implemented in recent releases.. @StarMinion You'll need this for initial setup: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. Should be the same issue as #813 , and fixed in later releases.. \u770b\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u8d26\u53f7\u6761\uff0c\u4f60\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u767b\u5f55\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u8d26\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u90fd\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\uff08\u6216\u8005\u662f\uff09 @chenshaoju \u672c\u4eba\uff1f\u76ee\u524d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u6b64\u3002. Actually this was added for a little while and got removed shortly. The reason I decide not to add retweeter icon is it may distract when reading through timeline, and also has performance impact on some devices.. This is a duplicate to #890 and fixed in 3.6.23.. Are you running Beta/Canary version of Chrome, or custom build of Chromium?. Copying tweet and its media involves two problems:\n\nSome users don't want their content to be reposted without consent, especially photography/artworks.\nIf user deletes a tweet, then in most cases the user really wants to delete it. Making that tweet out of control is disrespect to its owner.\n\nIMO Twidere shouldn't make those operations too easy, so this issue will be closed.. Tried and I don't find any problem about mention text counting and ordering.\nPlease keep in mind that:\n\nMentions' order are undefined (Twidere use hacks to keep reply style classic, but Twitter treats mentions as a set rather than an ordered list)\nQuoted tweets' mentions counts in tweet text, because quoted tweets are a link embedded in a tweet actually.. I can't reproduce, are they fixed in later versions?. Migrate to #281.. @rugk Is it played in tweet details or media viewer?. @rugk Currently you can tap on menu dots and select \"Open in browser\". I'm considering to add another button below YouTube player to redirect user to external browser or app.. Mobile notifications are limited to official apps and SMS only, and streaming is only workaround to this.. There's an option of your home timeline to show tweets only, filter out all mentions and replies. You can find it in each home timeline tab in Settings - Tabs.. I think it's a lack of feature in Twidere, \"Delete messages and remove conversation\" feature will be added (for non-official keys) soon.. Should be fixed in recent versions. I'll close this once new version published.. I found the root cause to power draining problem. There'll be a fix for this in next release.. @andschwa When a refresh task failed in background, it may keep device awake since old implementation only release wakelock after task finished successfully. Now with background service completely rewritten, wakelocks are released despite whether tasks successful or not, and all tasks will have a deadline to finish forcefully after a period of time.. Is Tusky working on your phone?. Merged to #885 .. @Tback1 Android 4.4\u7684TLS\u52a0\u5bc6\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f00\u542fTLS 1.2\uff08\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5f88\u591aMastodon\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ea\u652f\u6301TLS 1.2\u3002. This is available in Settings - Others - Scrapyard (sorry for making this preference too deep!). Pressing 'overview' button should open recent tasks screen. Have you upgraded your system?. @ilf Do you mind give me some details about your device model, and some screenshot about your launcher and Twidere on your phone?. @ilf I saw a message with nearly empty attachment. Could you check and send me again?. @ilf I saw your message. \"Overview\" button should always open recent tasks screen, not device menu. Maybe your device firmware update changed keymap from \"Menu\" key to \"Overview\" button, so it changes Twidere's behavior. I believe this is related to firmware configuration not Twidere it self.. @ilf I get you. This is called 'Menu' button, and will be fixed soon.. Only official keys can access group DMs. Please make sure you re-login after keys changed.. What gallery app you're using? I tried with Google Photos but it works.. Adaptive icon is available in beta channel, you'll soon be able to get an update once it's ready.. Dup to #912.. Try develop branch or latest tags.. 1. Exporting tabs are not so hard to implement. But, it involves accounts since tabs depends heavily on accounts, which is a quite dangerous action to migrate accounts also. If we provide option to export accounts, an attacker could easily get owner's credential on unlocked device. This still need to be discussed.\nSeems \"read from bottom\" option was changed?. Note: This was caused by same reason in #956.. @andy-twosticks Web interface only hides texts. Seems Twidere is handling sensitive flag well.. @andy-twosticks It's not a link, it's an image attached. Seems mastodon.social doing this by forcing Sensitive on while CW enabled, but not on pawoo.net . IMHO CW and Sensitive flag should be treated different. Twidere hides media when Sensitive on, and hides detailed text when CW on.. What's this version?. Well this feature is kinda undocumented. I'll think how to give users a notice about this.\n\nYou can choose who to RT/fav by long-tapping on RT/fav icon.. @n8noon Could you provide more information? \nFor example, is tweets sent by 'web' still exists in search results, even you added 'web' to Filters - Sources list?\nMultiple selection is worth considering, although retweeting/following too often in a short period of time may have some problems on Twitter side.... Currently you can open this notification, and quit that settings page. It won't show twice.. @Foggalong Totally agree. I'll add actions to turn it on/off directly inside notification.. @bobobo1618 If we load too many tweet from database, app my crash due to CursorWindow limit (2MB normally). One row may contain ~3KB data, if we load 1500 it would be ~4.5MB, way beyond 2MB limit.. @bobobo1618 Paging is what we need. I'll use this for data loading and make storage limit way higher.. @moritzheiber You can load up to 200 messages at a time by change \"Load item limit\" in Settings - Contents.. Since I don't have compatible device for Replicant ROM, could you please send me full logcat message to my e-mail address? (Not here because it may contain sensitive information). @nscomputing @herbsmn So both of you are using Trebuchet?. @nscomputing I can't reproduce on stock AOSP w/ Trebuchet or Nova launcher. Do you mind sending a full logcat to me for investigating?. @herbsmn Thanks. I'll find out why ASAP.. Thanks for the info everyone. Could you provide more details like Android version and device model?. @NoblePink I installed cm-13.0-20161221-SNAPSHOT-ZNH5YAO3Y6-shamu on Nexus 6 but still not able to reproduce. Do you have theme/gapps installed? Could you provide logcat since boot for investigation?. @herbsmn I still can't reproduce. does new version works?. @rogers1106 3.7.1 switched back to aapt. I'll make sure it switched successfully. However if this still not working, there'll be nothing we can do at this moment.. Fixed in bcc1d2f140e594dfd5d001d5463a4bfa9f8fe0f1.. Mastodon didn't provide character limit info in their API - And any changes to character limit is undocumented. Twidere can't aware of that kind of changes unless they support this feature officially. Feel free to reopen this or create a new issue if Mastodon add this feature officially.. I won't add drawer in every screens.\n\nAdding too much complex layout slows speed.\nNavigation drawer should be located in root of navigation hierarchy.\n\nAdding quick navigation in anywhere to open certain pages is nice though. Maybe I can some quick actions like a FAB on every screens.. We are planning to use \"Quick control menu\" as implementation.\n\n. Thanks for report. I'll take action soon.. Since they're playing dead after I tried to reach them out, I sent DMCA takedown request. Hope this will work!. @Poussinou Ah, Google Play replied me to ask for more information, but I ignored that message. Now I sent them more information and hope they can take action.. Done :)\nThose apps are taken down from Google Play. Thanks to everyone for your information!. @frankFic Hi, calling CookieSyncMananger.createInstance() is for compatibility. CookieManager.getInstance() may throw exceptions without CookieSyncMananger.createInstance() called on some versions.. @orithena Yes, this feature is available to all users. I'll start to change text counting algorithm.. Hi there, this feature may not be available soon since Twidere is working on a major refactoring, and my job draws me more attention this time. I'll make it ASAP but don't expect a new update too soon.. Any actions related pinned tweets are restricted to official apps only. Please try Custom API keys. Yes, this is opted-in ad in Twidere. You'll see some ads after 'Promotion rewards' option enabled. If you don't want to see ads, you can disable this option or purchase enhanced features.. @nakal I'll add more info of this option (e.g. adding examples) in future releases to help people understand this feature, thanks for your report!. @nakal Oh, promotions should be disabled first. Then you'll be able to see purchase option.. Are you testing with your own tweets? Currently Twidere won't filter tweets in your own timeline. For list timeline I'll try reproduce.. @jcs100 Ah I see. Are rules applied to newly refreshed tweets? Only home/interactions has real-time filter applying for now. But making all tabs capable of applying filter real-time is in milestones.. @Ariette Now there is. Moments are practically tweet collections. . Here's a more universal solution: Turn off \"Enable retweets\" in user's profile (located in menu). This feature is also available in official clients and webpages.\nIf you want to exclude retweets in a user's timeline, you can easily tap filter icon on top of the timeline and uncheck \"Retweets\"\n. @georgedorn Does this feature matches your need?. Phew. All id attributes in Twidere are strings already. Twidere users don't have to worry about this API change.. If any problem occurs after server side update, please reopen this.. This is the same issue as #854. @chenshaoju \u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f '/direct_messages/event/new.json' \u662fTwitter\u7684\u65b0\u7248\u79c1\u4fe1\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4f1a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1f. @chenshaoju \u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u662ftwip\u7684bug\u3002\u65b0\u7684\u79c1\u4fe1\u901a\u8fc7 /direct_messages/event/new.json \u53d1\u9001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u63a5\u53e3\u662f\u4f7f\u7528JSON\u4f20\u9012\u6570\u636e\u7684\u3002\n\n. Hi, what's your OS version, device model, and launcher version? I'm able to open keyboard when compose from home screen opened.. \"Connection timeout\" error is network related. Either your network was slow or mastodon instance failed to respond. . Search history can be easily removed by swiping. There's no need to add another option.. Fixed in b3926faa34809871625d124a1e24d4b5a56b1595.. Done. This will be improved in next version.. @contraexemplo You can open a new issue, thanks.. I believe this is the same issue to #935 . Let's move to that thread.. There should be a color strip at the right side of each tweet. This indicates which account this tweet belongs to. You can change account color in Drawer - Accounts list. @iknownothingaboutcomputers Yes. Related for 280 characters are added today. This issue is a duplicate to #975 . . We're working on full datastore reimplementation. All tweets will be stored in database instead of internal cache, which can improve tweet status inconsistency a lot. However, using per-tab statuses is very necessary since using references between tables will take more time than storing redundant data.. This is configurable in Settings - Others.\nYes, navigation drawer is part of the design guideline, but we already have gestures and related guidance for opening drawer.. You may need to apply patch file from twidere/patches/remove_closed_source_dependencies.patch to build from source.. Twidere added Admob ads since 3.7.0. These ads are part of \"Promotion reward\" feature - Users enable this feature explicitly to use enhanced features for free, in exchange of seeing some kind of ads (banners at present). This feature can be turned off anytime in settings.\nGood news is, since ads and Google Play Services are not FOSS, they are completely removed in F-Droid version, which means F-Droid version doesn't contain any trackers or ads. (Though it may lack of enhanced features).\nSo, if you use Twidere installed from F-Droid, you don't need to worry about any privacy issue.. 1. You can distinguish tweet from which account by setting account color.\nYou can set account color by long-tapping account in list in Drawer menu - Accounts.\n\n\nAccount color is also displayed when retweeting. I'll make an option to use single-account mode #841 \n\n\nYes. I'm planning to integrate this (although it will require a Github account too but sending feedback will be much more simpler)\n\n\nGood idea. I'll provide this feature in future releases.\n\n\nIf Settings - Network - Bandwidth saving enabled, preview media will be hidden when in cellular network.. @regularlabs Thanks to @orithena 's answer, that is correct. Also please keep in mind that once I finished #1016 , full featured interactions tab may be available to all users. (It needs some configurations though). Now message bubble will take up to 85% of screen width.. @regularlabs It's changed in mariotaku/MessageBubbleView library, so you may not find it in Twidere's code.. It's not possible to login to a StatusNet instance just by typing its host address. StatusNet doesn't provide API to retrieve auth token like Mastodon. All instances requires me to register and apply for an OAuth key.. Done! Twidere will not trying to fetch DM for Mastodon instances in future releases.. I don't have such an instance. Could you paste JSON object, or URL link of your status here? If you don't want to make it public you can also send me email.. @annando A field with permalink to this status would be nice. It called external_url in GNUSocial FYI. You can name it whatever you want and tell me when it's ready.. @annando While this isn't Twidere's problem, there are something Twidere should improve indeed. As you can see Twidere tries to send parameters that is unused other than Twitter.. Nice features! Please also tell me more about Mastodon exclusive features. Thank you.. Could you tell me more about this feature request?. It was used before, but removed later since it would be better to let system handle such gestures.. @azumukupoe You can take a look at #970 . This will be added similar to swipe gesture, but in other forms.. Yes it's intended. When timelines like \"Notifications\" and \"Public timeline\" not available in any tabs, they will appear in account menu.. It's a weird problem. Are you using dark theme with default background? Is this device running custom ROM?. Currently it's possible with this hack. Sensitive contents should be hidden by default. You can disable this option in Settings - Content & Safety.\n\n\nAlso in-app browser itself is a feature by Chrome actually, it can be disabled in Settings - Content & Safety.. I'm not able to reproduce. HTTP 502 is gateway timeout error, which means that problem may happened on server side.. Gateway timeout error doesn't happen between Mastodon server and Twidere, it happens between Mastodon's load balancer (like CDNs) and real server behind.. Could you provide crash log here or to twidere.project@gmail.com ?. @annando Yes. See here. Reply count only available to official clients. Here's an workaround: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. Seems you want to turn off retweets from specific user. It is available in user profile -> menu -> enable retweets.. Please provide more information, like is this a bug or a feature request. If this is a bug, please tell me how to reproduce. If this is a feature request, provide what this feature request need more detailed.. Do you mean display 'follows you' in each user in a list?. What is a thread view, please? Please give more detail to your feature requests, this can help me implement them better.. Are tweets from muted user displayed after they got muted? Does they appeared in home timeline or mentions? Have you enabled streaming?. GNU Social added profile_image_url_profile_size field in User object, and Fanfou added profile_image_url_large. Both fields has an URL pointed to larger profile image. You can consider use fields like that.. See https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/blob/a1e58482027d8c40b5c33cb551981f2beb497ec6/twidere.component.common/src/main/java/org/mariotaku/microblog/library/model/microblog/User.java#L156 . Have you changed Twidere's custom keys? Only keys from https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 are available to these features.. Status page is being rewritten. I'll see if it occurs on new status page too.. See #1016 , Twidere's basic features will remain, but streaming feature will be completely gone.. @GambaJo Seems you've selected \"Empty\" auth type.. Account is distinguished by a color strip on the right of timeline. If you have more than one account, it will show in every tweet and notification.. Though it's not documented, Twidere supports custom dns addresses with port number: address#port. Tell me if you find any problem.. Yes it's possible. Multiple DNS addresses are separated by ;,, and . Yes, this is indeed a good idea and was planned.. Got it, fixed :). Some wake lock were held incorrectly in Twidere. This is being investigated and fixed.. Posting irrelevant issue on open source project is simply spamming. If you continue posting unrelated topics on my repos, I'll report abuse for that.. LOL, just please go ahead. \nBTW I know Godwin\\'s law is real thanks to you. Wish you have a wonderful day fighting with \"facism\" and \"censorship\", good luck!. Most of us DO hate when Microsoft acquired Github. \nHowever, @PaulFree14, did you ever saw this statement by Microsoft?\nYou simply spamming on people's repo, forcing them to be on your side, and just say those doesn't agree with you complicit in taking part of enabling fascism/racism/mass arrest/murder?\nAnd you think I'm privileged? Risking myself developing Twidere In a state that threatened and jailed people for developing or hosting censorship circumvent tools? \nFor god sake could you please stop this slippery slope?\nI'm not asking for an apologize. I just want to let you know how not to let others agree your opinion.. My final answer is, no. I currently don't have plan migrating to other open source platforms, since they are technically not stable than Github. \nI do have concerns about freedom of speech being violated since Microsoft is more prone to govt's takedown request, or even possible to hand out user information to whom actively contributing to anti-censorship tools or documents revealing govt's dirty secrets. When Github & Microsoft doing that, we'll surely do anything helpful like archive those data to prevent them from completely removed.\nJust remember, one choose migrate or not migrate from Github have their own reasons. And we have our own position on political spectrum. But most of us definitely would stand up to defend humanity, not just by moving data from a platform to another.. Seems you have streaming enabled. It's indeed a problem since Twitter won't filter blocked tweets for streaming. \nHowever Twitter will shut down streaming soon, so there won't be this problem ever, so do this feature :(. Got it. Seems to be a reply fetching problem.. You may want to try this: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786\nOnce this enabled, some links will have preview.. What do you think if there's an account selector (like compose dialog does) in retweet dialog?. Thanks a lot! I received several design and they looked awesome. And I'll try those designs when I make next version ready (4.0). Thanks for your pull request! LICENSE file of Twidere is located at https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/blob/master/twidere/LICENSE.txt . Since some of the code is licensed under Apache License, licenses will be located in each sub-modules.. Sorry for letting you all waiting. It's hard to believe but I work from 10 AM till 11 PM (sometimes even 2-3 AM) in a startup company, that why there's no any updates last year.\nSince I found another job and will leave this mess soon, I hope I could still maintain Twidere in 2019.\nTL;DR: I was busy as hell in 2018, I'll start to maintain Twidere in 2019 if I could.. @cmmata That would be great! I'll mark some issues as 'help-wanted' once finished current refactoring.. ",
    "vanita5": "Okay, I did'nt knew this was part of the unofficial API!\n. Thanks, I merged this into Twittnuker!\n. In this case the problem is, that you want so see a gif image. Twidere is not able to display gif images!\n. It will work again if you disable auto refresh on start.\n. Sadly, no. I spent some time debugging, but I didn't came to a conclusion.\nHowever, it seems the mListScrollOffset in BaseStatusesListFragment.java seems to get wrong values from somewhere.\n. Just to clear things up (I saw your tweet and I'm not sure if I understand it correctly):\nThis bug is also present in Twidere (current version, compiled from source). So this is a upstream bug.\nI tried my best to fix it but I couldn't find a solution and create a pull request. So I decided to open this issue so you are aware of this bug and also I think you may be able to fix it.\n. I got a quick but very dirty workaround. getTop() from child View's always returns a too big value. It's exactly 120px, at least on my device (OnePlus One, 1080x1920, 400dpi). I fear this value may differ on other devices/screen resolutions.\nWith this I was able to fix it on my device, just by substracting 120px from the offset. See the example below.\nNow the problem is I don't know where this value gets set/calculated. Looks like the Android API is doing this?\nBaseStatusesListFragment.java#onLoadFinished()\nif (firstVisiblePosition != 0 && lastVisiblePosition != mListView.getCount() - 1 && loadMoreFromTop) {\n    listVisiblePosition = lastVisiblePosition;\n    savedChildIndex = childCount - 1;\n    if (childCount > 0) {\n        final View lastChild = mListView.getChildAt(savedChildIndex);\n        mListScrollOffset = lastChild != null ? lastChild.getTop() - 120 : 0;\n    }\n} else {\n    listVisiblePosition = firstVisiblePosition;\n    savedChildIndex = 0;\n    if (childCount > 0) {\n        final View firstChild = mListView.getChildAt(savedChildIndex);\n        mListScrollOffset = firstChild != null ? firstChild.getTop() - 120 : 0;\n    }\n}\n. Just tried it out, looks promising.\nThank you very much! :)\n. Oh sure, wait, I'm gonna improve this. My fault :)\n. I'm currently working with the Mastodon API and I'd love to implement this, but I'm afraid I won't have time 'till next weekend.\nIf anyone else is interested in helping out in the meantime, you can take a look at my node library regarding the login flow and how to get an access token: https://github.com/vanita5/mastodon-api. @orithena Thanks for the notice. I will also fill out a DMCA request. Hope this helps.. ",

    "benediktg": "Is this issue actually still relevant?\n. I can not reproduce this issue.\nUpdate: O yes, after reducing the database size to 50 and scrolling down quite a bit I can indeed reproduce it.\n. Is this still an issue?\n. 1) F-Droid is now providing pretty recent releases of Twidere.\n. Isn't this implemented now?\n. @oprudkyi I click on that link and choose to open it with Twidere \u2192 works.\nI have Cyanogenmod 13 and the most recent Twidere from F-Droid.\n. In my opinion this issue is solved because\n- Twidere shows no tweet text at pictures\n- rotating the view does not seem slow for me\n. I do not have this issue\u2026\nThis picture says that Twidere has used about 8 MB of mobile data in February.\n\n. I think this issue is obsolete because there is no possibility to add a lists tab anymore. If I don't lie this functionality is now moved to the sidebar menu and I do not notice any crashes there right now (with latest snapshot release 160210).\n. In my opinion this issue is not relevant anymore because I could successfully create a list, add a user (my own account), delete this user and delete the list right now. (with Twidere v3.1.3 from F-Droid).\n. Navigate to the page where all the members of the list are enumerated:\nSwipe from the left edge to the middle \u2192 \"Lists\" \u2192 tap on a list \u2192 go to the tab in the middle (\"members\") \u2192 long press on one member \u2192 then you can choose to delete the selected member.\n. Is the issue still occuring with the most recent version of Twidere?\n. Which Twidere version are you using? With Twidere v3.1.1.6 from F-Droid and CM13 I do not notice this issue.\n. @andy-twosticks Nice.\n@mariotaku How about closing this issue for the time being?\n. I also would like know if this issue could be fixed because somehow Twidere has stopped getting updates in F-Droid since 2 months.\n. I think that favoring posts in GNU social now works with Twidere.\n. It is great to hear that you want to improve the GNU social compatibility \u2013 I have reported 2 bugs I have observed: https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/305 and https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/304\n. Could it be that groups in GNU social aren't supported by Twidere? Groups are written like \"!group\" (with a \"bangtag\" instead of a hashtag) in GS posts.\n. How about opening separate new issues and referencing them here?\n. @asterismo When you go to settings \u2192 cards \u2192 avatar style (in German Einstellungen \u2192 Karten \u2192 Profilbild-Stil) there is actually a setting to choose between circular (default) and quadratic profile pictures.\n. @asterismo When you tap on settings and then \"other settings\" (down below) \u2192 \"scrapyard\" \u2192 \"media preview style\". There you can choose between scaling or cropping the picture.\n. No, unfortunately neither redownloading 20160126 nor installing 20160131 did help with this issue.\n. This is what I get after trying to load new messages two times (with Twitter and GNU social account enabled) and searching for \"twidere\" in catlog. \n2016-02-01-23-38-57.txt\n. This is indeed solved in the 20160131 release. ;-)\n. Should be no problem anymore \u2013 at least I can not observe this issue with Twidere v3.1.3 from F-Droid.\n. I also would appreciate it if the setting for the character limit was more prominent. How about setting a default value of 140 chars just as before but letting the user set a higher value for each individual account? I have heard something like that GNU social has an interface for getting the character limit, but decide yourself which is the best way to to this (if you want to implement this feature). ;-)\n. great!\n. @mariotaku +1\n. I also recommend trying this build https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/releases/tag/3.0.5-SNAPSHOT-160217-2\n. Probably this is not the proper place to propose that. The additional links like the source code repository, issue tracker, change log etc. are maintained in the metadata repository located here: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata\n. Yes, I also would appreciate a reference to the F-Droid repository, but I would wait with that until the new builds are getting built and published at F-Droid. ;-)\n. I think this might be similar to #51.\n. Please try out Twidere v3.1.3 and tell if you still observe this issue.\n. Could you please provide an example URL?\n. For me it seems to be fine. The first time I watch the video the sound is turned off by default. When I turn it on I can watch the video over and over again without the sound getting turned off.\n(with the current version from F-Droid)\n. Maybe there is a regression?\n. Could you please provide an example URL so that other people can try to reproduce the bug?\n. OK, I assume it could be a regression because I do not have problems when watching these photos and videos.\n. It is OK, I see.\n. Do you still observe this issue in Twidere v3.1.3? At least I do not\u2026\n. In my opinion it is even more undesirable to have to login again all the time when you switch back and forth between the F-Droid variant and a Github/selfcompiled version. Just providing an additional APK with a different ID would solve this issue because then the different signatures would not compete anymore.\nOr could you tell me a simple way to change the ID by myself so that I can install a selfcompiled version without the hassle? ;-) \nPS: I have tried it in Android Studio by refactoring/renaming the package name and the applicationId in the build.gradle but it did not compile then. Or, when I just changed the applicationId and the suffix in the build.gradle it compiled, but the generated APK still had the same ID\u2026 :-(\n. That certainly would be an improvement, but it still does not enable to have two versions installed at the same time. And doing a version downgrade requires you to remove and install and therefore login again. \nbtw: Why are the accounts not saved in the exported settings (optionally)? If that was possible it should also be a reasonable compromise.\n. Could you provide an example URL to a tweet which contains this character so that I can try to reproduce this bug with my version of Twidere?\n. I can confirm it with Twidere version 3.0.6.1 from F-Droid, too.\n. It think that is indeed possible to unfavorite a tweet \u2013 you just have to wait a few seconds after you have favorited it. In addition to that I have noticed that sometimes tweets are actually favorited but the star/heart is not coloured.\n. And I unfortunately cannot reproduce this issue with Twidere v3.1.1.6 from F-Droid. The scrolling positions stays the same \u2013 no matter how often I rotate the screen.\n. Same on v3.1.0 from F-Droid \u2013 the edit profile button is functional neither on the Twitter nor on the GNU social profile.\n. I'm using v3.1.0 from F-Droid and did not have this issue. In addition to that I have a combined timeline as well as separate timelines for Twitter and GNU social like you.\n. @mariotaku Thanks, re-adding the account worked so that I got a message that I am already logged in. After that the right chararacter count was fetched.\nI think you just need to interpret the \"textlimit\":\"0\" as unlimited.\n. I can not complain about Twidere (v3.1.3 from F-Droid) consuming too much data volume\u2026\n. Qvitter and the classical view of GNU social just provide an option for only presenting the stream of notices (without conversations), the notices \"X favorited something by Y\" simply are not displayed at all.\n@mariotaku: If you want to do something about this, it might suffice to just filter out messages containing the exact string \"favorited something by\" (although it is indeed rather a hack).\n(referring #296)\n. @archaeme Yes, if you put the strings favorited something by and deleted notice {{ into the filters then those notices are not shown.\n. What does that mean in English?\n. v3.1.5.2 is not the most current version, could you please check if this issue also occurs on v3.1.6 which is available at F-Droid? :wink: \n. @mvdan I rather think it is because he merged it into the develop branch and not master.\n. What does that mean?\n. I also would appreciate if Twidere recognized the rotation metadata contained in images properly (if feasible).\n. ",

Thanks! I can finally go back to use Twidere as my primary client! Whohoo!\n. Bumping up this issue. Twidere currently receives and displays long DMs, but the \"send\" button in a DM conversation is silently useless if I try to send DMs longer than 140 characters.\n. I've had the same idea. This would help users in languages that use a latin alphabet... like german.\nTo be really useful, this feature would require a \"tweet sending queue\" where each subsequent tweet waits for the predecessor to be successfully sent and then includes it's tweet-ID as answer reference. This pseudo code (syntax borrowed from jQuery) hopefully helps to understand what I mean:\ntweet(tweetchain[current]).onSuccess( function(successful_tweet) {\n  tweet_answer(tweetchain[next], successful_tweet.tweetid);\n});\nThen, the best (but most complex to code) option would be to change the \"compose tweet\" dialog in the following way:\n- Whenever a tweet exceeds the 140 character limit, it is split up in two input widgets, displayed one after another in a scrollable container.\n- Splitting occurs at certain points:\n  - Preferably at a double line break (if existent)\n  - Then at single line breaks\n  - Then at \"full stop, quote character, space\"\n  - Then at \"full stop, space\"\n  - Then at \"comma, space\" \n  - Then at \"space\"\n- Each tweet in the chain is then optionally ended by \" \u2026 [x/n]\", where x is the current tweet number in the chain and n the total number of tweets in the chain and \"\u2026\" is U+2026.\n- Each subsequent tweet in the chain is optionally started by \"\u2026\" (U+2026)\n- This would reduce the maximum length of each tweet in the chain to 128 characters + the \"helper characters\" from this list, assuming that a chain can not have more than 99 tweets.\nA really simple option would be to extend the \"tweet sent\" toast to include a button \"Immediately answer to this tweet I just sent\", opening a standard \"answer to tweet\" dialog (as seen in Firefox mobile when opening a link from another app). This would make the whole process outlined above manual... you'd have to write the first tweet, wait for the toast that says \"tweet sent\", tap on it, getting the \"answer to tweet\" dialog, writing the next tweet and so on... (current workflow for that: send first tweet, wait for it to be successfully sent, go to user tab, refresh it, wait for it to be refreshed, answer to own tweet, delete own twitter handle from the answer (see #257), write answer, repeat. This is really tedious when you're on a german mobile data contract that is throttled to GPRS speed...)\nThis feature would be really appreciated by my german followers; I was a bit surprised by the number of favs/RTs requesting such a feature: https://twitter.com/anathem/status/669998807648755712 :)\n. Thanks @mariotaku! \\o/\nReading again, I found some edge cases to consider (in the complex option):\n- some people might like setting manual splitting points (could be considered done if users knew that they only need to enter a double linebreak)\n- sometimes, one might want to edit something in one of the first tweets of the chain. In this case, the whole chain would need to be joined and re-splitted again.\n- sometimes, one might want to send a tweet chain as answer with mention. Here, the @-mentions would need to be prepended to each tweet in the chain, further limiting the character limit per tweet.\n. With draggable endpoints, one would need to create/derive a new UI widget, I'm afraid. More complex/tedious to code.\nI just dug through the twitter API docs and found some thoughts about rate limiting:\n- There does not seem to be a way to check in advance how many tweets can be sent in the next 15 minutes without getting back a rate limit error. GET application/rate_limit_status does not seem to cover POST statuses/update (https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status)\n- There does not seem to be a fixed rate limit for POST statuses/update: https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits\n- All I can find is \"2400 tweets per day, but sublimits exist\" (https://support.twitter.com/articles/355430). This article can be seen as a hint that status updates are limited to 50 tweets per 30 minute sliding window. On the other hand, the rate limiting docs talk about 15 minute sliding windows, so we're down to 25 tweets in a burst (=immediately sending the next tweet when the server replies with \"success\").\n- Taking into account that the user needs some time to write a tweet chain (and therefore did not send a tweet in the last 15 minutes or so), I think it's safe to assume that tweet chains up to 25 tweets could be sent in a burst, while longer tweet chains should wait at least 45 seconds between each tweet request. Simple solution to that: limit tweet chains to 25 tweets. Sounds good enough :)\n- Taking the HTTP response headers \"X-Rate-Limit-*\" into account to throttle the tweeting rate might be a good idea, but my experience with them did not yield any usable result yet (might also be the fault of the library I'm using or me using that library wrong). -> https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting\n. @smalltock: My post stems from before Twitter changed its rules about counting @-mentions. You're right, it's not that much of an issue anymore.\nAlso, with multiposting to accounts with different character limits, your idea has got more merit. Probably it could be solved by some buttons named \"preview split text for account X\"?. @bigretromike Just use the official keys to login to Twitter, then you'll be able to see the whole media timeline: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. It's not completely gone, but crops up on my phone under different circumstances: Nexus 5, stock Android 5.1.1, no automatic media previews, patchy mobile connection capped to GPRS speed (not unusual in germany because of crappy mobile contracts), and not enough patience. In this scenario, when I view the timeline and tap a link to a image, it opens full screen; then it takes too long to load, so I tap \"back\" and read more of the timeline. Still being interested in that image, I go back and tap that link again, opening the black canvas for the image. After 1 or 2 seconds, the loading animation stops and the \"Unknown Error, it may be a bug\" crops up. The only way to view the image then is to open the tweet and tapping on the media preview.\nI feel it's a problem of an improperly closed connection that is tried to be reused. In the past, this also came up when the mobile connection got lost while loading an image (instead of the user stopping it loading).\n. I propose to ignore that change and keep Twideres starry look.\n. Can confirm on Nexus 5/Android 5.1.1.\nComes up more often when opening that view for the first time after not using Twidere for some hours.\n. I also want to discourage an in-app browser (at least an obligatory one), because I want to continue reading Twitter while a webpage loads in the background ...\n. Twidere does not use a push notification server (it's an open source project, and servers cost moneyz), therefore it has to poll every x minutes, which can be changed in the preferences. But shorter update periods mean more drain on the battery. You might consider using the streaming extension, but that could be an even bigger battery drain.\nIt's a standing issue to enable users to set up theur own push notification server for Twidere.\n. Can confirm what mpiffault writes. Is there a UI-Read-from-Cache-Thread and a Network-Write-to-Cache-Thread? If so, it seems to me that occasionally the Reader fails to receive a \"done\" message from the Writer, then the User is getting impatient, tries to refresh, a new Writer is started, but is being blocked by the still-running first Writer. \nBacking out of Twidere and starting it again then kills and restarts all threads and re-reads everything from cache; which is why the User now can read on, but does never have a \"load more\" option in this case.\nI think this is related to timeouts. This occurs more often when I'm throttled down to GPRS speed while moving in a spotty network (i.e. having a german mobile data plan that's over it's monthly high speed quota and therefore throttled by the network provider down to GPRS speed; and travelling by train with Deutsche Bahn). I surmise that this is very hard to reproduce at home or in Japan. One might be able to reproduce it by shielding the phone (aluminum foil?) from the next cell tower so that the phone just does not drop the data connection, but also dropping 99.9% of the packets coming in.\nI can't find a timeout setting in Twidere, so I can't try changing that to see whether this behaviour changes ... strange, I thought I have seen such a setting a year ago or something like that.\n. Try swiping in from the left screen edge.\n. This would be a duplicate of #481, marked as fixed 18 days ago. Commit fb9969f looks like it fixes exactly this. Maybe the fix didn't make it into your build yet?\n. Addendum: This also turns up in search tabs (following a hashtag). I seem to remember that this had been fixed somewhen in the past, but turned up again a few weeks ago. Regression Bug? (Using Twidere 3.1.6)\n. Seems to work correctly with the new rules now -- closing this (way too late...)\n. What exactly do you mean? Assuming you think of protecting/unprotecting your account: This feature is not exposed to third-party-clients by the twitter API. \"POST account/settings\" does not cover it (but you can check the protection status using \"GET account/settings\") -> see https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/account/settings and https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/account/settings\n. Looks like @mariotaku already implemented some to-be-changed character count rules (see #556), but Twitter isn't ready yet. I expect that this issue will resolve itself as soon as Twitter actually enables the new rules on their servers.\n. @wnabernik The new rules aren't rolled out yet, not even in Twitter Web. There's no good way to handle this situation; either way, you get complaints. Either because someone wonders beforehand (like you), or someone wants the feature NOW as soon as it makes it's round on Twitter or because someone did not see the option in the preferences (which is, coincidentally, the most hassle in terms of coding and not worth to do just for an intermediary time span).\nI'd say it's better to err beforehand. Least complaints (only acute users like you even spot it) and the feature is usable as soon as it's rolled out on the servers.\nTherefore, technically, I'd call this a non-issue, waiting for it to resolve itself.\n. @mariotaku The switch is due on Sept. 19th -- see http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/12/12891562/twitter-tweets-140-characters-expand-photos\n. I just noticed that the official client now stopped counting reply mentions at the start of a tweet. Looks like it's time for the next config push, @mariotaku :D. Just tap on the active tab header.\n. Swipe in from the left edge. You'll find the search dialog there.\nAm 29.

Looks correct. Second and fourth letter inverted against current background. Checked with web and official Twitter App with and without Night Mode.\n. Can confirm this behaviour on my phone (Android 5.1.1). Sadly, I too cannot provide hard reproduction circumstances, which is why I didn't report it before.\nTo me, this smells like a timeout behaviour, but I don't see what the timeout is for. It certainly crops up more often on big images while being on a bad connection -- but in very rare cases also on WiFi. What's more puzzling: If I go back and try to load the image again, in rare cases it's already there, loaded from cache. Also, switching apps while waiting for the image to load seems to suspend the thread receiving the image, increasing the chance to break. Maybe the image loading needs to be moved to a service thread? But isn't it already on a service thread? I'm confused here.\n~~In addition, the reload button that's displayed when an image failed to load does not seem to have any event handler associated with it.~~ [EDIT: Gotta retract this part, seems to work now. Sorry, I didn't re-check it.]\nMost of the time, I go with \"Load in Browser\" when the image failed to load. This works, then.\n. Sorry, I disagree with this proposal. If you're on a slow connection, it's really good that you can wait for the image/video to load in the background while you read on.... Nice, @mariotaku :) ... I forgot that this setting exists.\nBut may I propose to rename it to \"Multitasking\"? (Would still be a technical term, but more people would have an idea what it might mean. \"New Document API\" is only understood by developers...). Can't reproduce. Took 11 seconds here on WiFi.\nAre you sure it isn't your connection? As far as I can see, Twidere waits until the whole video is loaded before starting playback.. I see an OutOfMemoryError in there. Please reboot your device and try again (sometimes, the system memory has a memory leak, especially if you used the camera a lot -- you can check your reserved system memory in Androids Settings -> Apps -> Active; it should be below 500MB). If the problem persists, please report back.. In 3.3.29, it's \"Additional Settings -> Junkyard -> Show Publish Time\" (if I'm translating correctly from german here...). This feature exists. Add a \"Show timeline\" tab.. I remember having that once after upgrading to a new version of Twidere. It went away after I cleared the databases, reinstalled the app and removed thr apps data in Android Settings (or the other way round, can't remember). Could it be some kind of database schema upgrade issue between versions?. 1. UI design... well okay, I can halfway agree on that. It might be hard to integrate, design-wise. Still, I'd love to see the alt text somewhere when the media itself isn't loaded yet; if only it is to encourage using that feature. If people without screen readers don't see these descriptions, they have very little incentive to actually provide descriptions themselves. Also, it would help people with little bandwidth to spare (like me) to decide whether to load the media or not.\nHere's an idea: Could you split the \"load media\" button into \"load media\" and \"show alt text\", maybe the latter as an icon (e.g. a speech balloon, U+1F4AC), popping up a modal dialog containing the alt text? I'd imagine that's not a very big change, coding-wise...\n\nWoah, I never noticed it. You're way ahead of me! (Can you increase the size? :)\n\nAlso: Big Thanks for the best android twitter client I know, @mariotaku!. Please provide more context. The form actually is there to be filled in. The developers need to know your Twidere and Android version and a description of how to reproduce the problem... because: swipe down normally does work on my device on all tabs.. Ah, the context \"profile view\" was the point. In this case I can confirm this.\nSwiping down to refresh a profile does not seem to be implemented or does not work (Twidere 3.4.22-google, OS: stock Android 6.0.1, device: Nexus 5, official API keys). It does not matter whether I view my own profile or someone else's profile; even when there was a timeout due to bad network connection I cannot refresh the profile.\nI'd mark this issue as a feature request since I cannot remember if this was possible at all at some point.. Umm... I might've misunderstood your request and/or situation, but I think you could solve this by creating multiple timeline/interactions/etc tabs, one for each account. Changing the account in the sidebar currently only applies to the views opened from the sidebar. One tab is tied to one account, but you can create multiple tabs of the same type in Settings > Tabs.\nIf that does not solve the tediousness (granted: in a slightly different way than you expected/requested), then I'm at a loss as to what you're referring to (and I assume that the main developer would be, too), because it really differs from my experience with Twidere. Could you please elaborate further, then?. I just opened the Spreadsheet 1.1.3 APK file and ran dex2jar on the .dex files ... he didn't even bother to refactor your class names. Also, I found classes by @vanita5 (Twittnuker fork) in there.. This is a duplicate of issue #190, which already contains a lot of thoughts around the idea. Please close this one.. I'd like to have this feature, too.\nI propose a caching table for this with the following columns:\nvarchar user_id primary_key, varchar at_name, varchar name, timestamp added, smallint category\ncategory could be 1 for \"I follow\", 2 for \"Follows me\", 3 for \"I mentioned them\", 4 for \"appeared anywhere in my tabs\".\nThis table would then be filled event-based, i.e. whenever Twidere receives user information, this info is thrown into the table, inserting or updating as needed (primary_key re-identifies the user and avoids duplicates, at_name and name may need to be updated, timestamp always needs to be updated, category may only be decreased).\nSince a caching table has to be tidied up from time to time, the timestamp would make it possible to throw out the oldest entries, while we make sure to keep at least some of each category.\nSomething along these lines would help greatly finding the user I want to mention.... In contrast: Can't reproduce this on Twidere 3.6.21-google/Android 6.0.1. Also, this crash behaviour never happened to me.\nAm 18.

I second that motion, it's happening to me with favs and retweets, too. Especially when I'm taking the train and lots of connection problems arise.\nI'd like to propose an alternative way of handling this: Tweets, favs and retweets that are automatically saved to drafts should be marked as such and re-tried automatically as soon as the data connection stabilizes. Or, at least, a bar should show up saying \"You've got drafts that have been saved automatically, probably due to connection problems. Would you like to send them now?\". Ummm... are you serious?\nThe Twidere app on your phone needs these permissions to be of any use to you, i.e. to display your timeline to you, to allow you to send tweets and to display and send your direct messages. It needs these permissions to fulfill the function it is designed for, i.e. being a Twitter client.\nI'm at a loss here. What do you think Twidere is for? (Really. I'm curious.)\nIt's not the case that the people who wrote the Twidere app would be able to see \"your Twitter\". When you login using your Twitter credentials, a secret key is negotiated that allows the Twidere app to login to Twitter in the future without asking you again for your credentials. This secret key stays on your phone and your phone alone (and the backup copy in your Google account, if you didn't disable it... and probably also on the NSA servers, but if you're concerned about that, you wouldn't use Twitter). \nUnless, of course, the people behind Twidere are sneaky enough to insert some code into the Twidere app that sends them that secret key. But that's what Open Source is for. You're welcome to check Twideres source code for any traces of such activity. (Hint: There ain't no such malicious activity. Other people would have seen the code necessary for that activity already and Twidere would not be in the Play Store any more as a consequence.)\nYou are very right in asking why any funny web app should be able to read your direct messages or be able to spam your followers with any tweets... but a fully-fledged Twitter client does need all of these permissions to be of any use to you.. Just found this: There's a new paper to generate Halftone QR Codes:\nhttp://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/Projects/SmartGeometry/halftone_QR/halftoneQR_sigga13.html\nPossibly interesting to use as alternate Fancy QR Code generator? :D . I can't reproduce either anymore. Even the tweets that got saved to drafts are now being sent correctly (which also didn't work at the time of raising this issue).\nI'm now writing it off to a temporary problem on twitters side or on my phone (I did reboot since then). It's just that I used that function for the first time (normally, I'd attach images from my gallery).\nThanks for investigating, though!. Can't reproduce the behaviour you described, at least not on Twitter using official keys and a single-account interaction tab. I believe Twidere simply shows in the interactions everything what it receives from the network servers. (Also, I'm not sure that I really understand your second paragraph. I can guess that you've got a multi-account setup, but I'm not sure how it affects that.)\nCould you please elaborate on your setup? (which Social Network, whether you answered from a different account of yours, etc... basically, the steps to reproduce the behaviour you're describing.). I still can't reproduce. With or without streaming, whether I create a new tab for that or not... although, you seem to have a different version than me (I have 3.6.21-google). I don't see the text \"Full interactions only when streaming enabled\" in the tab options. If yours is newer, could it be a regression bug? But it does not feel like one...\nAlthough I'm not a Twidere dev, I know Twitter and its protocol a bit... I gotta say, I never saw anything like that in the interactions stream. Except they might have added something like this to \"give you the impression that something is happening in your interactions\". But, seeing your profile numbers, I don't think that they'd do this in your case.\nI'm stumped here. @mariotaku, have you got any distant clue as to why this might happen?. That string I mentioned is just not translated into german, so I don't see it (I would've thought that the english string would be used in this case).\nAnyway, I now tried for days to reproduce this, I even checked the Twitter Web settings for anything that remotely looks like it could influence this... Cannot find anything.\nThe only thing left to assume (for me) is that Twitter (probably temporarily) put you on a server testing a protocol upgrade or a server with a data glitch.\nDoes it still persist? (You may talk with me on Twitter to test it -- I'm @anathem there.). Related to #872 ? (Although, ok, you tried reinstalling... did you delete app data, too?). Hm. It works here, using Twitter with Twidere 3.6.21-google with the official keys from https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 ... did you enter one of these after reinstalling, but before logging in?. <sarcasm>You'd have to thank Twitter for that.</sarcasm>\nThird-party apps (more exactly: their keys) do not get access to some features. This includes group DMs and some notifications (you might have noticed that your notifications are now complete in Twidere, too).. For what it's worth: I approve of that reason.\nFurthermore, there's a legal reason not to do that: Twitters API usage rules explicitely state that if you're embedding a tweet elsewhere you must check back regularly whether that tweet has been deleted. Copying a tweet blatantly ignores that rule, while linking adheres to that (the check is performed inherently on accessing the link).. If I see that correctly, your question is answered in #795. So, the answer is: Twidere would need an app key for each and every gnusocial instance. Keeping track of all instances popping up is almost impossible. Use basic auth (or somehow get a key for Twidere to include).. It's not a bug that I know of. I can delete DMs just fine, using Twidere 3.6.24 (from Google Play) on Android 6.0.1.\nKnowing Twitter and their protocol a bit (I'm not a Twidere developer), the answers to the following questions might help to nail down whether it's a bug in Twidere (and where it is):\n\nDoes that DM show up in the Twitter Web interface?\nCan you send DMs to that company from the Twitter Web interface? \nIf yes, can you delete that DM from the Twitter Web interface?\n\nIf you can answer yes to all three questions, it might be a bug in Twidere in the DM deletion part. If you answer the first question with no, it might also be a bug in Twidere, but in the \"DM sending and error handling\" part of Twidere. In any case, the following information might also be helpful (yes, I know, some of them are not easily checkable, just answer them to your best knowledge):\n\nDo you follow that company's account?\nDoes that company's account follow you?\nIf not (to any of above), do they accept DMs from everyone? Also, do you accept DMs from everyone?\nIs that company's account disabled/suspended/deleted by now? I.e. did the status of that account change since sending that DM?\nWhich version of Twidere are you using? (Settings -> scroll the icon bar down -> the icon with the circled 'i'). This has got the hallmarks of \"Twidere tries to delete a not-anymore-existing DM and does not interpret the resulting error code correctly\".\n\nAlso, I'm a bit surprised that this company could answer your DM when you don't accept DMs from everyone. Looks like Twitter updated DM handling in a way that's more consistent with users expectations, but I wasn't aware of it yet.. Oh, another question, @iknownothingaboutcomputers: Does that deleted DM go away when you update DMs (by pulling down in the DM overview screen until the loading indicator appears)? (Additional info for @mariotaku: I just noticed that DMs of accounts I blocked don't go away when I do that... they do go away in the official Android Twitter App, though.)\nAnyway, thanks for clarifying. Up until that, I was under the impression that you deleted that DM from Twidere.. Okay, I can't think of any more info that might help @mariotaku to find that issue, so let's just hope he finds it.\nTo answer your other question: It really depends on the settings for that VPN. If it is set to \"redirect all network traffic via VPN\" (as opposed to \"redirect only traffic intended for the internal network of company X\") and that VPN uses a router that does Network Address Translation (i.e. masking the VPN-internal address of that user), then Twitter will only see the VPN router's IP address.\nYou could check that by visiting websites like http://whatismyip.com, once with VPN active and once with VPN inactive. If the website reports different IP addresses for each try, Twitter too can't see your real IP address if you're logged in via VPN.\nThere'd be an exception to that rule, which applies if the VPN client is not a real VPN Client and just sets a proxy for the browser. In this case you'd be better off if you simply configure Twidere itself to use that proxy.. (I'm not on the Twidere team.) Really does look like a rip-off of a two-year old version of Twidere. Reported it.. Looks like it's already possible just by setting the parameter \"weighted_character_count\" to true:\n\"Click 'Tweet' in the web ui\nF12 Remove 'disable' on the tweet button\nClick it, and go to 'network', right click on the request and copy as cURL\nThen, add &weighted_character_count=true as a param to the end of the url\nThen, resubmit the tweet with curl.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/912904724063641602. Also, just to confirm: Reading Tweets with 280 characters already works perfectly.. 280 characters are now enabled according to https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/tweetingmadeeasier.html\nAlso, I can confirm this by checking the official Twitter App.. Most of the stuff of your first paragraph is already possible, but sadly, not for third-party apps (i.e. non-official apps). You can get around that limitation by using one the official keys when you first authenticate your account in Twidere against twitter. See here: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786\nUnfollows are not made visible by Twitter. You'd need to use your own scripts and database to do that, e.g. with this script: https://github.com/orithena/twitter-follower-report\nYour second paragraph would be interesting, I agree on that, but since this data is not directly available without polling the API often (counting would not work reliably, since you still might use Tweetdeck in parallel), implementing it reliably would drain your battery and the rate limit imposed by the Twitter API. Implementing it unreliably would just increase the bug reports and it would be more trouble than it's worth. A better way for that would be a Twitter bot perusing the Streaming API and sending notifications via Tweet/DM to you.. There is an \"interactions\" tab (or at least, you can add it in the settings -- swipe in from left to see the settings menu). With the official keys, likes and RTs of your tweets, mentions to you and follow notices are shown there. It's a bit limited when you use the default keys. Also, after you changed the keys, you need to do a complete re-login including re-authorization of the app; i.e.: remove your account from Twidere and re-add it. (This is due to a process called OAuth, where you enter your password once to allow the app on your phone to negotiate a cryptographic secret with Twitter for all future use. This secret is saved on your phone; removing your account from twidere removes that secret too. In addition, you can revoke such secrets in your profile settings on Twitter Web.)\nRegarding the number of Followers/Tweets: yes, that could be done once an hour or so, but would require loading the whole user profile. Normally, this is only updated on viewing it. I myself would not want my Twitter client to load more stuff than necessary.\nThen again, I'm not a Twidere developer, I'm just a user who knows a thing or two about the Twitter API (having written Twitter Bots myself). Therefore, please keep your improvement suggestions coming, even if I tell you why it would not work nicely or why I personally don't like it. In the end, it's the developers choice (and sometimes, his timetables choice) what to implement next.. Please don't. That would mess up the visual cue for the start of the line and makes re-reading your own longer DMs harder.\nSee also: any typography book. Here's an example (under the heading \"Centered and right-justified text blocks\"): http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/3-legibility.html. Ooh, now I get your meaning! I do support that feature request, including the fixed width! (which would improve legibility by creating the visual cue to the start of the lines of your own DM storm ^^). @deutrino Please check #795 and maybe #496. @mariotaku can't keep track of all the gnusocial instances and needs the help of others to add more.. You mean like this? \n\nIt shows the activity on that tweet reported by the Twitter API at the time of loading that tweet. To save bandwidth and avoid hitting rate limits, no attempt to refresh that data is made until you interact with that tweet. So, if you have the Streaming API enabled, a tweet would reach that stream before any interaction could have happened. Tap that tweet to open its thread, then Twidere will load fresh data, which will also be updated when you go back to timeline view: \n\n. Hmm... It also might have to do with me using the official keys, see https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786 (Twitters own keys get to use enhanced API).. Strange. When I tap on a like/RT notification, i.e. one that looks like this:\n\n... it takes me to an intermediate dialog that shows the concerning tweet(s) and user(s) that are complicit in that notification:\n\nFrom there, I can choose between jumping to the tweet displayed in thread context or to each concerned user profile. All working as expected, as I just confirmed.\nThis intermediate dialog is necessary because multiple notifications might be combined into a single notification (multiple users liking one tweet/RT or multiple tweets/RTs liked by one user).\nI also cannot find a setting that might influence the behaviour you describe.\n(Using Twitter on Twidere 3.7.3-google on Android 6.1.1, having official keys entered manually.). No sweat :). Using the API Keys from https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786, DMs do still work in Twidere. . I'm not a developer... but did you try to increase the database size in the storage settings?. Interesting. I can set it up to 500 objects. And Cache Size up to 500MB.. Since it's still working here (Twidere 3.7.3-google), I suspect it's one of the following points:\n\nYour custom keys have been reverted to standard Twidere keys. To make sure this isn't the case, remove Twidere from the list of allowed apps (somewhere in TwitterWeb -> settings -> apps, if I remember correctly)\nThe tweet which you're looking at has been loaded when there haven't been replies yet. If you're using streaming, this would be the case for most (if not all) tweets.\n\nCan you verify whether none of these points apply? (There's always a third point, intermittent server issues on Twitters side, but you can't verify these ^^). @azumukupoe This describes how to create a thread. We still don't know what you mean by \"thread view\".\nDo you mean to view the thread, including all its answers? (this already exists). Do you mean a tree-like view on a thread, like in old usenet clients? do you mean to view only the main thread without the answers? if that is the case, how should the existence of answers be marked?\nAnd, after you posted that link, another possibility comes to mind what you might mean: an explicit way to create threads, perhaps? We've already got that covered in #190 and #51.. That is the part that already exists. Just tap on any tweet of that thread. Okay, it's not quite like the official app, because the official app omits and shortens here and there ... you get the whole view in Twidere.. @iknownothingaboutcomputers Same here on google. From what I read in some messages from @mariotaku, he's working on a major overhaul to v4.x, which takes its time.. The user agent is determined by the OAuth application key used. So, you need to obtain such a key, enter it in Twidere and then re-authenticate (by removing the account from Twidere, then, when you re-login, use one of the icons at the top to enter a different key. Only if you re-login afterwards (i.e. need to enter your password), that other key will be in use.)\nLuckily, there's a list of some keys listed here: https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786. Settings -> Tabs -> Add (\"+\" symbol) -> Home -> tap on \"active accounts\", select your mastodon account -> Save.. This already almost exists in Settings -> Tabs -> + -> Show Timeline (disclaimer: translated back from german, the actual wording might differ ^^).\nBut only almost, I just checked and saw that it only applies to twitter accounts. I assume that the backend code needed for that just isn't implemented yet for Mastodon. I somehow assume it's already on the TODO list for Twidere 4.0. ^^. After reading this whole thread... I suppose it comes down to this:\nWhere do you draw the line?\nFollowing the original premise consequentially would mean to denounce every entity that did trade with a \"bad guy\". One cannot do that. (Yes, I know that this looks like a slippery slope argument, but I'm arguing that everyone has their own line where their slippery slope starts.)\nThe premise begs for fallacies because there is no right way out. Either the argument devolves into whataboutism or into the slippery slope argument. It is an exemplary tool to divide a community that found together on completely different aspects.\n@mariotaku chose his line. Let him. If you disagree, it just means that his line is drawn on less indirect constellations than yours.\n@PaulFree14: Please reconsider your argument about \"that is polite tone in the culture you come from\". I know that tone to be prevalent in german Antifa circles. I'm german, I'm anti-fascist, and my biggest gripe about the Antifa circles is that their reasoning often implies \"If you're not with me/not following my argument and conclusion, then you're against me!\" -- and this is what your original post implies (at least to my understanding).\nNow, with that in mind, please imagine @mariotaku on the other side of the world, minding his own problems stemming from the politics in his own country and having his own cultural education about what is polite and what not. I presume that his feel about your original post was like someone suddenly breaking down the door of his room and screaming \"AGREE WITH ME AND DO AS I SAY OR YOU'RE MY ENEMY FOREVER BECAUSE OF POLITICS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD!\"\nI'm exaggerating here, of course, but please reconsider your view on the backlash to your proposal. I'm not surprised that @mariotaku reacted like he did.\nPlease try to establish in your culture that this is no polite way to present an argument. The way I see it, you run into the risk of hardening the opinion towards the opposite side, because people outside your cultural circle feel pressed into defensiveness when confronted with that line of reasoning. And defensiveness creates and hardens arguments opposite your intentions. (This argument is presented by my knowledge from that one university course on Social Psychology that I visited.)\nOh, yes, I'm derailing here with the second half of my post. It is meant as food for long-term thoughts for @PaulFree14; I don't even want an answer on that. Please consider both parts separately.. I experience the same behaviour (with Hackers Keyboard), but it only comes up when I'm way behind in my timeline and new tweets have been loaded -- so that the currently displayed tweets already must have dropped out of the DB or something like that. Killing Twidere (in Androids app settings screen) helps, though.. Can confirm, even with official keys. To me, it looks like the old DM API has been killed somewhen during the last two days.. This works on my end. Try using the official keys (remove account from Twidere, enter official keys as linked in your post, re-create account in Twidere). There has been a point where Twitter removed some DM support from the API for third-party apps... with one of these keys, Twidere looks like the official app on API level.  . This is due to Twitter changing its API for third-party apps. Until the maintainer comes back from real life and actually has time to check whether the new API allows such things at all, please use one of the official keys, available at https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786.

You could just highlight the different segments in alternating colors. Yellow and pink, for instance. The segments could have draggable endpoints for manual delineation.\n. Didn't mean to close\n. As far as editing earlier parts of a post go, I have an idea.\nSuppose we had a \"split\" toggle button, which would run the split algorithm and break up the message into 140-character parts.  To unsplit it, just toggle it off.  All the strings will be concatenated back into one big message.  Ideally, one wouldn't split the message until they're finished writing it and about to send.\nDraggable endpoints aren't necessary.  @orithena had a good idea earlier, that users could simply know that double-line-breaks are the highest priority.\nI would also add that as a lowest priority, we should also allow splitting the tweet between characters, if none of the other criteria are met.\nI don't think @ mentions will be an issue, since in my experience, the only post whose character limit is affected by @ mentions is the first in the series.  Replies don't seem to be affected.\nHere's where it gets tough.\n\nWhat to do with tweets that have attachments?  Should we just assume that it should be attached to the first or last tweet in the sequence?\nWhat about tweets that are being sent to multiple accounts, one on GNU Social or Mastodon, the other on Twitter?  The character limits are wildly different on all of these platforms.  The tweets may have to be split differently, in which case having interactive split widgets would be unfeasible.  Maybe, the widgets should not be interactive, but instead splitting should be an automatic post-processing thing.. The use case I had in mind was to use the in-app browser to preview links and decide if I'll queue them (as a tab in external browser or Pocket) for reading later.\n. Ahh. Should future PRs be done in the develop branch next time to avoid manual changes?\n. \nOn gs.smuglo.li which has no character limit, I can't send anything.\ncurl -s https://gs.smuglo.li/api/statusnet/config.json | tr ',' '\\n' | grep textlimit\nReturns:\n\"textlimit\":\"0\"\n.

Thanks.\n. The actual website puts favorited and repeated notifications in the notification section, so I suppose one need only figure out how GS itself discerns and mimick that.  Or maybe we can detect something intrinsic to the message.  \"Favorited\" notifications can't themselves be favorited, you get an error.  Whatever difference is there can probably be used to discern.\n\n\n\n\n. RTs would also be nice to have in the notification area.. No.  This is the free version from F-Droid version 3.3.35.  Also F-Droid currently recommends this version as stable.  Will the feature be removed from F-Droid version since they only allow free and not paid software and does not promote paid software?\nThanks.. Thanks.  \nI am not sure about that though.  You would need to check their documentation and/or contact them.. This redundancy is useful because, depending on which card I like/RT/reply determines which account I like/RT/reply with.  If the redundant cards get merged together, then the 'Open with account' function will need to be fleshed out so that we can open a fediverse 'tweet' in a different account.. Like this?\nhttps://twitter.com/DaniDivineModel/status/857268002269650946. If it's any consolation, you can follow diaspora users on GNU Social.  I don't think they receive your replies or likes, however.. @mariotaku This doesn't always work.  For smaller cards, you can long-press the RT button to have it RT to another account/platform.  But for larger cards, like if you enter a thread and want to RT the tweet you're focused on, the long-press doesn't work.  You have to find a way to view that tweet in a smaller card, probably by selecting a different tweet in the thread, but that's not always an option.\nHere's a video to demonstrate what I mean.\nhttp://roaming-initiative.com/mediagoblin/u/anastasius/m/minor-twidere-bug/. @mariotaku This is no longer an issue.  Pleroma devs implemented a mastodon api that works almost totally flawlessly.  Pleroma on the mastodon api works better in Twidere than actual mastodon, it's pretty good.. I just want to add to this.  It's not just drafts that crash it.  If you go into the accounts page and long-press an account, Twidere will crash there also..

What's the hosting website of the said pictures?\nFor the The SPORT Bible, they don't have any picture to show here and I can fav' or open the link on the latest version, 0.3.0-dev (from the Play Store).\nEdit: they do have a Twitter Card, but looks like Twidere doesn't load them, like many other clients.\n. Well, they all works for me except if they are gifs. But I haven't found any 3rd party apps that can see Twitter's gif (because they're converted to MP4 videos).\n. I like I said, @inemesitaffia, Twitter GIF's are not GIFs, but videos (screen shot of the code from the 9GAGGifs' tweet). By the way, Twitter doesn't give us the link to the video from the API, so we can't do anything \"officially\" (for now?).\n@vanita5: Twidere can display GIFs, but not animated :P (only the first frame).\n. Meh. Maybe make an option for that, but I would not have something that always asks me, especially when I only use the back button to quit the app.\n. Looks fast and fine for me, but I'm not sure why it needs to load the pictures a second time.\n. Haven't got the OTA Update yet.\nDoes it just close or do you get a message saying \"Twidere stopped working\"? \nCan you maybe share us some logs? (you can host it at gists, maybe.)\n. Wow, welp. You can change the number of loaded tweets if you want to the maximum, which is 200. You can see the screenshots here: https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/29#issuecomment-60344736\nAlso, to reason for why there's not a \"load all\" is because we have some limits by the Twitter API.\n. Err... It's like if you're making them disappear with the swipe gesture. Not sure if it's \"logical\" here. And we use the swipe gesture already to change columns.\n. I can confirm it doesn't work. It loads the tweet_video_thumb image instead.\n. @mariotaku Hmm... You should still be able to get the \"GIFs\" (I hate their idea to convert this to mp4) from any apps: \nhttps://twittercommunity.com/t/adding-animated-gifs-via-rest-and-streaming-apis/30070\n. Looks fixed, using 4f34fb4780c8af511a9e5e6ca3e4d98d3d9dedcc\n. You can disable the \"interactive scrollbar\" by going to the preferences, Interface  and uncheck \"Fast scroll thumb\".\nBut I like the idea to have the choice to move it to the left, especially for left-handed people.\n. The two comma (;) should be inside the inline-code too.\n. Long-press the enter button to show emojis.\n. Slide from the left edge of your screen to the center. A drawer should appear with \"Settings\" and more in it.\n\n. ",

Just tried the latest tag, and the counter works now\n. @mariotaku changing that settings does solve the problem when refreshing tweets when the twidere activity is in the foreground.\nYet when tweets are refreshed in the background, then I open Twidere UI, I get positioned in the top !\nPlease note: this is what I experienced last month, I didn't test this using today's commits.\n.

I am having similar issues on my Sony Xperia Z3 running the latest version from the Google Play store. I just installed the Google release snapshot and made no difference for me.\nI ran the network diagnostics in Twidere and it gets to:\nTesting API functionality\nTesting verify_credentials...\nAnd gets no further.\n. ~~Perhaps I have a separate bug? Even if I force close the app nothing happens for me.~~\nEdit: Just checked, you have to force close the app from the Settings / App menu, not from the task switcher.\nUpdate: It now entirely works with the 3.0.5 snapshot after force close. The network diagnostics continues past the previously mentioned point.\nAnother update: After a few hours I had to force close Twidere again to get it to refresh.\n. @ghc0000 in Twidere go to Settings > Other Settings > Usage statistics > Network diagnostics\nThen press Start and scroll down to the bottom.\n. @dleigh I agree, although the latest release may contain some patches over the snapshot posted previously. I'm currently trying it out.\n. I'm finding I'm still having to do this. Significantly less often, maybe once every few days, but it still happens.\n. It doesn't happen 100% of the time, in-fact it's improved slightly recently, but still happens. Might depends on the list. Still testing.\n. I have a similar issue as per #371, although the detail has changed due to the way cards are now displayed without the URL in the tweet, but has made the situation worse.\n. So this seems to be resolved to an extent in that in the list view of tweets you can now press on the 'Media' bit at the bottom of the tweet and it goes right in the full screen version.\nIt's dead easy to miss-hit but it's a start/\n. Same issue here. I wasn't sure if it was larger images or all images.\n. At the very least it needs a better error.

",
    "vphantom": "Actually my main problem is that the hiding/revealing of the compose buton and the title bar are exactly backwards of what is naturally expected: when we're scrolling towards the top (finger top-down) while catching up chronologically, both are shown, and when we're scrolling into the past (finger down-top, towards older tweets at bottom), they are hidden to give us more room for some reason.\nThis UI behavior seems to assume that people read the newest tweets first, and catch up with progressively older tweets in reverse order until they see something they remember, like what the Twitter web site itself does (which is crazy - after all these years they still don't save timeline positions and no user seems to care).  That's nuts for someone like me who uses Twitter mostly for news; I make the client remember my timeline position specifically so that I can catch up in chronological order.\nSo anyway, my work-around is to \"over-scroll\" by about 1cm, then scroll back up 1cm to make the compose key and title bar disappear, giving me the most screen real estate.  I'd inverse this behavior if I could, but like I said I'm not well-versed here.  Java I could work with, but I know nothing of the massive Android API.\n.

It isn't specifically exposed in the API, so might be difficult to recreate.\n. https://blog.twitter.com/2015/hearts-for-developers\n. It's half fixed. The top name (in green) is correct. The bottom name (in red) is wrong.\nShould be @example_ not _example@\n\n. Avatars nowbload quickly. But if there is media attached to a tweet neither the media nor the avatar loads.\nWill see if I can proxy the requests to see what's happening.\n. The URL display is fixed, but the tweets are still truncated on latest 3.3.29. See https://twitter.com/MarmiteJunction/status/810011941267709952\n\n\n\n.

Agreed. I'm on the Nexus 6 running Lineage 7.1.\nActions like adding a favourite can sometimes take several seconds to complete - freezing the app. Happens on wifi or cellular. \nClearing the cache seems to work for a short while. .

This is because Twidere looks at accounts separately when actually viewing or interacting with tweets.\n. I can confirm that images in excess of 3 MB will always fail, as per the Twitter media guidelines (Tweet creation requires images to be <= 3 MB). Twidere seems to attempt uploading anyway and reports the \"Tweet not sent\" error only after the server rejects the submission, rather than checking file size before trying to tweet. Native resizing would be nice, though even a warning about the oversized image would be preferable to wasting bandwidth on an upload the server will never accept.\n. ",

I'm getting the same but also for mentions.  A new mention comes in, I'll get notified about already read mentions for even another account.\n. Still an issue in 2015-09-03 release.\n. I created my own because otherwise I couldn't sign in after I reinstalled my phone a couple months ago.\n. Oh. I had to change the access of my token to \"read, write and access direct messages\".  Sad thing: no error message was presented to me about this.\n. Great, now I get network error all the time :(\n. That's what i'm doing, not even the web login loads anymore.\n. Really bad error reporting again:\n I use correct password = network error\n I use bad password = bad password error.\n. Reinstalling Twidere fixed the network error. wtf...\n. Yes, sorry, forgot to.\n. As usual (sadly), installing a snapshot recently rendered my Twidere entirely unusable and I reverted to the released version :(  It was the one last mentioned on Twitter.  It's extra uncomfortable because of having to reconfigure everything as a result.\n. No, I'm on normal Google Play usually\n. I just installed 0131 and unfortunately still no unread counters\n. Yes, I have disabled and then re-enabled in Scrapyard and still doesn't work.  It's not a clean install, but I'm reluctant to do that because then I'd have to enter my API key again...\n. I just reinstalled and it still doesn't work I'm afraid.\n. (as in, refreshing existing accounts or post to them, all of which are Twitter accs)\n. How do I get the log?\n.

There's the \"add to list\" action but not the opposite one. \nUse case: I'm reading a list and one user is annoying in it. I tap his avatar and would expect to manage his presence in the list from there. \n. BTW long press does nothing in 3.2.4 when I follow your steps, @benediktg. \n. I can confirm this. It's one of the more annoying issues because when I'm reading Nth page of tweets in a list and it refuses to load more, I need to go out and back again which takes me to the beginning of the list.\nIdeally, I'd like if Twidere attempted to load more automatically but if that fails, swipe up would be the manual way to load more..

Don't mark this as bug just yet I'm still just asking a question. \nThe behaviour I expected/desired was, when I had an account selected (from the navagation drawer) 'Everything' I did; eg.  retweet from other account home tab, would be done as that user.\n.

It's also where the actual notification is in.\n. Ok I see. Never experienced this in any App before though.

That's what I've described.\nI don't need yet another button, but just an option in the settings to disable the internal player. I just don't want to have to tap twice and load all the tracking stuff (or cookies), which may be loaded in the web view thing you use there.. Great, but is media streaming required for it? Can't we have nice things without that\u2026. ",

I'd also like a way to view an image's alt text (on both Twitter and Mastodon). If an image doesn't have alt text I generally want to add a description of my own, but I can't do that if I can't tell if there's a description or not.. This is also a big issue for me. I have to use the (much clunkier) web version of Mastodon when I want to post images with descriptions.. ",

    "annando": "There are some problems at the moment:\n- Picture upload doesn't work with GS since it is now a combination of two different calls that do media upload and posting. GS has a single call for this.\n- The GS API doesn't know the API call for fetching conversations (AFAIK GS has its own API call)\n- The API path (mostly) contained a \"/1.1/\" in the path.\n- There are some other calls that aren't supported by GS (like /statuses/lookup)\n. @iMojito Twidere is using the API command \"/conversation/show/(number).json\" for conversations (if it is enabled in the setup). AFAIK this isn't supported by GS at the moment. On GS the correct call would be \"/statusnet/conversation/(number).json\".\n@mariotaku What I forgot: The API call to \"/statusnet/config.json\" returns the text limit of the current GNU Social installation. It would be great if the client could fetch that by itself.\n. BTW: Since this issue is closed, I would suggest the creation of new issues and not appending new stuff to this one.\n. This setting activates another API call for the thread completion. We are using that in Friendica.\n. @mariotaku You can fetch the limit by querying the api: /api/statusnet/config.json. \n. There is a setting in Twidere where you can define a different limit. (It can be reached via the \"hidden\" menu if @mariotaku hasn't changed that in newer versions). And I guess that this setting will be easier to find in future versions.\n. Friendica supports the unofficial Twitter API call \"conversation/show\". GNU Social has its own call:\napi/statusnet/conversation/(conversation-id)\nThe conversation id is the id that you get in the message in the field \"statusnet_conversation_id\". I will add support for the GNU Social command in the upcoming Friendica version.\n. I just tried. See for example: https://quitter.se/api/statusnet/conversation/4287800.json - that worked for me.\n. I downloaded version 3.1.0.11 and it seems to work very well. Thank you very much!\n. BTW: I'm closing this issue since it is solved.\n. I guess that the limit is fetched when the account was created. There doesn't seem to be an option to refetch the limit.\n. According to my statistics there are at minimum 190 GNU Social/Statusnet instances. Additionally there are at least 400 Friendica instances out there in the world. Do you want to have keys for all these servers - or only for the public ones? (Open Registration/Invitation)\n. Diaspora has a purpose as well and it would be great if this could be added - but the missing API is the blocker.\nBTW: Diaspora and Mastodon aren't really comparable, I think. . Diaspora doesn't use OStatus nor ActivityPub. It used its very own protocol.. Identi.ca is using pump.io as micro blogging service.. Twidere can do:\n\nTwitter\nFanfou\nMastodon\nStatusNet (GNU Social)\n\nPump.io is not on that list. You could use AndStatus for pump.io.\nBTW: Concerning \"the information on the web is outdated\": Yes, many information is outdated there ;-) To which page are you referring?.

Thanks to the callstack I found it myself. Friendica hadn't returned the created_at field on the saved searches. The missing field lets Twidere crash.. Use \"StatusNet\" as account type and use the \"basic\" auth type. No version suffix and the API URL format is \"server.tld/api\".. I guess the important part of the error message is \"Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: profileImage must not be null\". So the API doesn't provide this field.\nBut you shouldn't use \"Twitter\", but \"Statusnet\".. I would like to say something to this issue: The point is not, what had been said, but how. I think all open source projects on github should consider moving somewhere else, eventually we at Friendica will move as well. But - from my point of view - it would had been better to simply ask in a polite way - without any activism - if this projects considers moving to some other repository.\nP.S.: This is planned to be my only comment on this..

    "Mr5quid": "Hi,\nI found a workaround for this issue : turning off the \"remember position\" setting.\n. Hi mariotaku, I'm pleased to see an answer :)\nTo answer your question : yes it is still happening. There has seemed to be an update almost every day for some time now but yes this is something I am still living with. Not only that but  my workaround has stopped working (turning off the \"remember position\" setting) since the update that featured the new settings menu.\nHowever since last month I did profile the issue a little  bit better : it only seems to occur when loading a lot of new content. For instance when I get up my device wants to load about 100 tweets and that's when I have to kill the app before seeing this new content. If it's just for ten tweets or so it loads them fine.\n. Just upgraded to 3.1.3, Twidere crashes instantly on start. Here's the error.\nhttp://pastebin.com/c02f5dah\n. Hi,\nSo after testing the latest version (3.1.4.2) for a few days I can tell you that it's still happening. I didn't want to write back unless I had some logs to share but I can't crack the pattern. It seems to happen randomly. What I know is that it never happens if I loaded the new content recently but yet it doesn't really seem to be time dependant neither since It can happen after only three hours since the last refresh whereas it can load it fine after ten hours ...\nIt's complicated to get some logs of it happening because I need to be bridged via ADB every time I refresh the app. With no visible pattern I'll just have to wait until I'm in luck. \nWell, now that I'm thinking of it out loud I guess I could use another method to get the logs.\nAnyway that's all I have for now. It's really not a big deal but it's just odd. I didn't have this issue before.\n. ",

It would be much better to be able to do it from the timeline, e.g. by long pressing the RT icon (as in Flamingo) or using a popup menu (as in Plume).\n. After using Flamingo for Android I would like to suggest the following:\nUpon longpressing RT or favorite or quote, bring up an account selector.\nThis would properly cap off multiaccount support and make Twidere the best multiaccount app.\n. Official Twitter API now respects the notification settings of the official app. If you disabled a certain type of notification in an official Twitter app, then your account won't get those notifications via the API anymore.\nI had a similar thing happen to me with Flamingo for Twitter -- I started receiving only mentions, because I had disabled everything except mentions in the Twitter for Android app before uninstalling it.. Mastodon posting works fine for me on mastodon.social and anticapitalist.party, so I don't think this is a bug in Twidere. Also, mastodon.host failed to load in a web browser while typing this comment, so it's definitely problems with their host. Trying again succeeded, but it took some time.. I think \"40 items per load\" is an API limitation, but you should be able to load more/missing toots by using the since_id and max_id. . I think this is Twitter default behavior now. Everyone tagged in a tweet will have their handles appended to the front, and they won't count against the character limit.. It could also save having to long-press the icon. ",

In 3.3.42, the notification would display when the app was opened by the user or the user manually refreshed the timeline, but in 3.4.2, this no longer occurs. Neither version shows the notification from the background sync, which was the original issue.. I'd think it'd be possible to append the social network onto the name so it doesn't confuse them, wouldn't it? Like \"UserName - Twitter\" or whatever. Besides, I believe AndStatus takes the route of having everything under one sync script that's configurable within the app rather than one sync option per account.\n. This is a duplicate of #543.. I decided to test this using the prerelease you linked me in #722, and it works in there. The export process was apparently hanging when trying to bring up the \"Please wait\" dialog. I also noticed some other dialogs were no longer hanging once I installed the prerelease such as asking to turn on auto sync & the \"Please Wait\" dialog that pops up before adding accounts. Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to these other dialogs (mainly because I didn't see them in 3.4.31) until I installed the prerelease, or I would've connected the dots sooner. XD\nSo, yeah, problem solved.. Well, after immediately opening it, I see the Home tab's notification works. So, yeah, seems this bug has already been addressed. \ud83d\ude06\nI'll keep an eye out for the other two just to be sure and will create a new issue report if they're still missing. Thanks for the prompt reply and keep up the good work. I hope those 4.x issues get worked out soon. My Kit Kat tablet needs this update, too, if you catch my drift. \ud83d\ude09 In fact, if you need the help, I'd be happy to play around with it to try to narrow down the cause.. I'm not sure why this was marked as \"fixed\" & closed. It's not fixed, though the order was changed. Now, using my initial example as a reference, @.SomeUser1 gets pushed to the very end just before my handle, giving a list like \"@.SomeUser2 @.SomeUser3 @.SomeUser1 @.Me\". Proper behavior should mirror the original reply's order, which would be \"@.SomeUser1 @.SomeUser2 @.SomeUser3 @.Me \".\nMy apologies if it wasn't clear in my initial post. Just noticed a typo when I re-read it. I had said \"adding my handle to the beginning\" when I meant \"adding my handle to the end.\" I corrected it.. So, I assume this was in the 3.4.48 update that was released the same day? If so, it's not fixed because as of that version, it's still mixing up the order.. Yes, I've tried with & without usernames in the reply. Same result. And it's probably worth noting that Twitter's mobile site, as well as Twidere 3.4.48 doesn't do this.. \n\n\n. But why is it intended? It completely ruins my threading, and doesn't happen on the mobile site or 3.4.48, as I said. I just tested by downgrading to 3.4.48 on F-Droid to be sure. So why the change? And why no way to disable it?. I think I understand what you mean now, in which case, this also affects replies to others, should the user choose to remove the user they're replying to from the reply message. Is that correct?\nAnd thanks for tolerating me & explaining it. I get cranky when I don't get enough sleep. XD. @mariotaku Thanks again. I suppose this is yet more proof Twitter has no idea what they're doing when it comes to coding. lol. Haha. Fair enough. Keep up the good work. This app is a godsend - especially for cheap devices like mine. 1GB of RAM means Twitter's official app would eat up way too many resources given its bloat, and the mobile site is clunky and slow, at best - even on lightweight browsers like Lightning.. @kathakatze Maybe a little background shading for the affected text? A sort of \"highlight\" effect using a different shade of grey than the window itself?. I've had the same issue with the Twitter for Android keys listed there. I think there might be a typo in there somewhere or maybe they're old keys that are for versions with more limited functionality than newer versions. I did some searching, though, & found the Twitter for Android keys in this pastebin work just fine: https://pastebin.com/Fgqed59f\nEdit: Weird. I compared the two and they're identical as far as I can tell. Maybe there's an errant unicode character somewhere in there?\nOh, and it's worth noting that some devices may add spaces before/after when pasting into the boxes. My 4.4.2 tablet does that. And come to think of it, that may have been the cause of the problem. I haven't used Mariotaku's page in a while since I first noticed that problem. I've always used the pastebin since then because I couldn't find Mariotaku's page. That's also why I never reported it, cuz I thought it was taken down. XD. Correct.\nOn Apr 29, 2017 12:37 PM, \"Mariotaku\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@Yowlen https://github.com/Yowlen do you mean after clicking \"Retweet\"\nbutton, tweet it displayed in retweet dialog isn't what you expected?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/813#issuecomment-298179490,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AQSZpIrjisRBL39Mql9O0ucMe9OLvcsiks5r02cxgaJpZM4NMSif\n.\n. Umm, I stand corrected. It actually shows the correct tweet in the dialog, but applies it to the one above or below, depending on the direction the user last scrolled.. First off, to address @0x1f415, it's not streaming, though it may be refresh-related. I don't use streaming & I get all potential outcomes, which I'll try to walk through here. I can't guarantee this will work 100% of the time, but it should be relatively accurate.\n\nI can verify this happens for all main tabs. Lists or user timelines within other areas may or may not be affected as I haven't tested them yet. I also can't state for sure if it occurs within the conversation popup view, but more on that later.\nAs I stated, I believe the issue occurs when I scroll through my main timeline and/or the timeline gets refreshed and tweets get added to it. More specifically, scrolling really fast seems to offset it more than a more casual scroll, or maybe it's just sheer numbers where it builds up based on how many you scroll past. I sometimes end up retweeting a tweet 2-3 tweets away in the timeline.\nIt also might be directional-based, as I stated in my initial report, but I'm not 100% sure as I mainly tested a single direction (upward). For example, if I scroll towards the top to view newer tweets, the retweet happens further up. The opposite (scrolling down to view older tweets) hasn't been tested by me, but I bring it up as a possibility to test if someone has time.\nI believe the retweet dialog has better compensation for this than the actual retweet function itself, which allows it to show the proper tweet while still retweeting an improper one if the scrolling isn't too rapid or whatever.\nRegarding the conversation popup, it's worth noting that opening a tweet or switching tabs seems to reset this issue, as does interacting with the retweet button. Once I retweet something, it starts functioning normally until I scroll more. I can scroll a little bit without it messing up, which lets me cancel the incorrect retweets if they're too far up to see, but going a dozen or two tweets through the list is all but guaranteed to trigger it again. On the other hand, liking a tweet seems to have no bearing on this issue. Only ones that switch focus to another area.. Admittedly very little testing so far, but first impression is that it's fixed. At the very least, the bug you found definitely contributed. I'll continue testing throughout the day to be sure & get back to you.\nEdit: Well, it's been all day & no more wrong retweets. It seems safe to say it's squashed, pending @0x1f415 's response.. I'm still using the official keys like I mentioned in #820.. Has this not been released? Or is it still bugged? I'm using the latest beta version (3.6.29) & the transparent bar is still visible when viewing media.. Ah, ok. Thank you for the answer.. Would it be possible to implement the request ability to get the final URL and then use that to fetch the media preview?. I see. I was afraid of that. Oh, well. It was worth the try. Thanks for the reply. Maybe if ISPs ever start allowing more than 1/5th of the 4G spec's top speeds, the issue can be revisited.. Umm, ok, I haven't seen any new version on the Play Store yet, but I did manage to \"fix\" the issue (though likely only temporary). I cleared the cache & databases within the settings & it works fine now. But I'm guessing it'll pick back up again once the cache or database fills up again until the update becomes available to me.\nEdit: Well, seems that it updated during my sleep & I didn't notice. lol\nBut the crashes persisted even in the new version until I did that cache/database clear.\nEdit 2: Now that I think about it, this wasn't occurring in certain tabs - only the most populated ones. That makes me think it was a database issue, since cache size is shared between all of them.. Yeah, like I said, it upgraded it for me while I was sleeping & I didn't realize it. The original reply about it still crashing was made after that upgrade to 3.6.21, so the issue still exists in this version. I had it crashing a few times before I did the database clear. I guess I forgot to mention that part.. I didn't send any crash reports for 3.6.21 because I didn't know it was a new version until after I had cleared the databases & posted here. I hope the ones I sent from 3.6.19 that I mentioned in the original report are sufficient, since until the database fills up again (assuming that's the cause), I can't send new ones.. I've noticed this, too. I've cleared the databases in the settings & it seems to speed back up for a while, so I can only assume it has to do with excess database usage.\nEdit: I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but I'm running Android 5.1.1 on a cheap LG Leon (ARM CPU), as well as 4.4.2 on a cheap Acer B1-730 (x86 CPU), and both experience this, so it's not specific to any Android version or architecture.. I've been watching anxiously for an update, too, and there hasn't been an update posted on the Play Store since this commit was made. So no, @nbara, the latest version still has this bug.. Yes, that has happened to me too. I forgot to include it in the main report.\nI've since gotten a new router, so the incoming packet loss shouldn't be an issue for me anymore, but it's still good to have Twidere implement checks to keep the tweet chain intact, as well as make sure the tweet doesn't get double-posted.\nBut yeah, cheap routers suck. \ud83d\ude06. Sorry. I kept forgetting to make a note of this issue whenever it comes up in my timeline. I'll be using this tweet as an example: https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/928294692969574400\nWhen I hit the reply button, I get this:\n\nThe handle from the quoted tweet gets put in between the main tweet & the handle(s) mentioned in the main tweet & causes the ones after it to turn white & count towards the character limit as a result. The middle handle should instead be put on the end like this:\n\n. This has been implemented in Twidere. It requires Media Streaming to be enabled & running to work properly. Look for this option in the 3-dot dropdown menu within the user profile page:\n\n.. I don't know, tbh. I never tested it. But I don't see why it shouldn't work w/ the normal sync.. I've personally had no problems using the consumer/secret keys for Twitter's official Android app, but this isn't the first time someone's complained about such an issue. I've seen some past reports here saying the same thing.\nA few things to make sure of: Twidere has both a \"Twidere\" and \"User settings\" mode when adding Twitter accounts. You'll wanna select \"User settings\" & then use the button in the top-left to change the keys before hitting the sign-in button - unless you've already changed the defaults used for the \"Twidere\" one in the advanced settings area. I can't personally vouch for changing the defaults, since I don't use that method, but I've never had any issues using \"User settings\" & manually changing the keys each time.\nAlso, some Android versions put leading/trailing spaces on copy/paste operations, and depending on what kind of input is used in Twidere's code for these boxes, formatting (font type/size/color/etc.) might show up & cause errors, too. So, ensuring the formatting & spacing is correct might also help.. I'd like to try to narrow down the methods by which you're adding the accounts. As I've said above, I've never had any problems with my method, so if we can see where we do things differently, maybe we can figure out where things are going wrong.\nWhen I add my Twitter account, here's the exact steps I follow:\n1. If I'm re-adding an account, I delete the current one from Twidere's Account page, just in case. Mariotaku's own instructions say it shouldn't be necessary, but better safe than sorry, imo.\n2. When I add a new account, I select User Settings from the Twitter dropdown box. \n\n3. Then I go into the API settings using the icon in the top-right, leaving everything at its defaults except for the consumer/secret keys. (You might wanna use the Load Defaults option at the top just to be sure, or you can line them up with my screenshot below.)\n\n4. As for the consumer/secret keys themselves, I use the Twitter for Android ones from this pastebin. I remember having issues with the ones on Mariotaku's instruction page in the past even though they look identical. I don't know if it was a Unicode issue, or formatting, or if I just imagined it, but I know the pastebin keys work, so I haven't gone back to verify.\nImportant note: Make sure there's no spaces before or after the keys! Certain keyboards/Android versions will put spaces before or after the pasted text.\n5. After saving the API settings, sign into the account. It should say you're authorizing the official Twitter client on the login screen.\nIf any of these steps differ from yours, explaining how may help to get to the bottom of the problem.. The simple OAuth method uses the default Twidere keys. That's why it doesn't work for you. You need to either make some custom keys at dev.twitter.com or use the official client's keys as per the links above. The custom keys are Twitter's \"official\" way of doing things. Using the keys from Twitter's official clients in 3rd party apps technically goes against their ToS, but they don't really enforce it, I think.\nAnyway, you'll wanna switch to the method I explained above & enter the keys of your choice. You should be good to go then.. @kkarhan What's the problem? As I said above, listing the steps you took to enter the consumer/secret keys can help narrow down where things are going wrong.. I get likes too, yes. I'm not sure what could be the cause if you're only\ngetting some of it.\nWhich key are you using? As I stated above, I'm using the one for Twitter's\nAndroid app. If you're using a different one, maybe that client has a\ndifferent way of doing things, which makes it incompatible with the Android\nway.\n\nBeyond that, all I can figure is to make sure all the settings are correct.\nThat includes the settings in Twidere's Notifications section, which I know\ncan disable some of them. \"Mentions only\" should be off. \"Your following\nonly\" may be causing issues too if the likes are coming from non-followers\n& the retweets were from followers.\n\nAs a last resort, you can load up Twitter's desktop page in a browser &\ncheck the notifications settings there to make sure everything's set right\nthere too.\n. Sorry. Not possible atm. The likes on the home tab are done with a separate\nAPI that Twidere doesn't use.\n\n. @yogubert Please check to ensure all the API settings line up properly. You can use my tutorial above for a list of all the proper settings, as well as step-by-step instructions on how to enter them.\n\nIf you're still having issues after verifying that, then idk what to say. I've used Twidere on every Android version from Kit Kat to the latest Oreo. My Nougat one used Samsung TouchWiz while all the rest were AOSP-based. Every time, the official Twitter for Android keys worked flawlessly.\nIn essence, the Android version can't cause this kind of problem because it's an issue with Twitter's API authorizations, not an issue with Android's functionality.. Did you try removing the account in Twidere and then re-adding it with the Android keys? If it still doesn't work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Twidere.\nIf that still doesn't work, I'm afraid I can't really help you.. 1. That's a decent point. Would it be possible to implement a placeholder or reset them to the initial account upon restore if the account isn't found in the list of activated accounts?\n2. I have that turned on so as to keep the current position, yes.\nI've noticed another inconsistency, btw. I'm not sure if any are related to any of this, but since you mention the \"read from bottom\" option, I figure it's worth bringing up. When I view a Mastodon conversation, I'd have to scroll up to see replies, while w/ Twitter, I scroll downward (my preferred way).. I'm using mastodon.social if it helps. Since it's server-side, it could be specific to the instance.\nIt's unusual that it occurred within just that time period, though. Also, it didn't seem like a timeout error since the error happened immediately. It's more like it was rejected entirely.\nIs it possible Twidere didn't send a valid closer with the dualpost but did when it was done by itself?. Ok. I guess it was just a weird issue with an intermediary server. It works fine now. Sorry for the trouble.. Duplicate issue thanks to browser crash. Sorry.. ",

When that's done, make sure you have the interactions tab open. From the interactions tab, open the left pane, click on \"Settings\", go to the \"Tabs\" section, and click on \"Interactions\". A window with 2 checkbox options should appear. One is \"Your following only\" and the other is \"Mentions only\".\nFirst, I tried clicking on the \"Mentions only\" option, saving, and having Twidere restart itself. This took me back to the interactions tab, but I didn't notice any changes. In fact, when I went back to the window with the 2 options, the \"Mentions only\" option unchecked itself. I found that kinda weird, but I kept going.\nI tried the same thing and chose the \"Your following only\" option. My memory gets kinda fuzzy from here. I saved and Twidere restarted, just like last time, except this time it didn't show notifications from people I don't follow. I think after that I tried swiping downwards to refresh the interactions tab, which resulted in some of my recent likes finally showing up, but only the likes from those I follow.

All accounts are activated in the Accounts tab. I hadn't noticed that there now is an extra tab for streaming under preferences. This hadn't been activated for the relevant accounts before. Now that it is, it doesn't change the described behaviour, however.. Thanks. How come the Messages tab is empty? Before group messages were supported I could see the messages. Still I recently had opened another issue about missing notifications for DMs. As those are now implemented this seems a step in the wanted direction. Seeing nothing there however is suboptimal. :-). The chosen account there is the one that is supposed to get DMs I want to read.. Strange: I've added a Messages tab for another account. This works, even group messages for this account work as expected. So I deleted the messages tab for my main account, restarted and readded the tab. It is no longer empty, but the only displayed content is an empty chat called Messages. On reception this one produced a notification with the comment \"null (0)\" IIRC.. E-mail is sent. Funny detail: My second account was recently added to the same group DM list. Now every time I get a message there Twidere shows a second notification with \"null\". Thus, Twidere keeps receiving DMs for my main account, but doesn't display them.. Deleting my main account and re-adding it after restart did the job. Now all DMs are displayed properly. Thanks.. Hadn't noticed this before. However, Twidere crashes when selecting an account this way reproducably. Also this selection is not available when opening the tweet.

I upgraded to twidere 3.5.32, and I'm experiencing an awful regression on\nthat one after a period of broken-but-bearable (not sure what release it\nwas, around end of February).\nThe behavior is now, when I have a long unread history (order: bottom ==\nolder), after some threshold the oldest entries are lost (and the cursor is\n\"correctly\" at the oldest) . If I download again older entries (and again\nand again), then any refresh started by twidere (for ex. by switching to\nanother app and coming back) loose all newly downloaded entries.\nPerhaps it's due to some cache filled up, but in that case, I don't want\nnew entries until I read older one. I woukd like to have a bar with \"cache\nfull, \u00f4 new entries dl until older are read.

I\u2019m on 3.4.48 (twidere-google-release.apk from github); Android 7.1.1 (LineageOS); Galaxy S3 (I9300).\nI only have one twitter account but subscribe to (9) private lists in separate tabs.  Whenever I switch to look at one of the list-tabs in recent releases, it always appears blank, automatically refreshes, and shows the most recent tweet instead of last viewed, so I\u2019m always losing track.  With previous versions I was happy to manually refresh each tab, and it would stay in position with newer tweets above (ready to scroll up/look at).\nI\u2019ve been through all my settings, and everything looks normal to me (read from bottom; remember position; no auto-refresh; no streaming; no refresh on start; no refresh after tweet sent; db size limit 500).  I don\u2019t look at my timeline often, so it can get very large (many 100s of unread tweets) so I guessed it was due to the tweet database getting too big and auto-deleting entries.  Maybe it\u2019s my own fault for wanting to store >500 tweets over all my tabs?\nI\u2019m currently going through the github release pages (fdroid & google versions) trying to find when exactly this started\u2026  Will update when I find anything.  So far, I've tested 3.4.2-fdroid and it looks ok - the list-tabs don't lose their positions or refresh automatically.\nDo you need any more info? Is this a different problem to the original one?\nTwidere is a really great twitter client.  Thanks very much for making it!. ",
    "matclab": "Whow\u2026 Thanks a lot !. I tried with twidere 3.6, and did not find how to open the retweeted tweet in the original author feed.\nCan you please give me a hint on how to process ?. ",
    "Hylak": "Sorry, I missed some fields.\nThe point was to know if this was a general issue or a device related issue. Reading your comment I guess it's the latter.\nThere isn't much to say, there's the message to \"swipe down to refresh\" where the tweets should be when you look at your profile. I try to swipe down, but anything happens. On my timeline and tabs it works, it appears the loading animation circle and loads the new tweets/notifications, but it does happen nothing in the profile.. ",
    "franciscojunior": "After playing more with the app, I notice that I can add a list of my own, or of others in the Tabs -> List Timeline configuration option.

Hello, guys! Thank you for implementing this functionality so fast! I joined the beta program as you suggested in a tweet reply and could create a link to a list directly. \n\nI tried and I liked it very much! \nI noticed that when you try to add a list, after you select an account, you have to choose a user. Would it be possible to show the account's list below the search for the user? This way I could add a link to my own lists directly instead of having to search for my own user to get them.\nIf you want, I can open a new issue about that.\nAgain, thank you very much for such fast response to implement this feature and keep up the good work! \nYou rock!\n. > @franciscojunior Feel free to create a new issue about this, it's a good idea.\nDone.

    "kathakatze": "I totally agree, quoting the tweet instead of simply replying is unexpected and nearly always undesired. This breaks the usual self-reply threading and makes it even more confusing than twitter's new reply style. In most cases I've seen nobody else is involved, so the problem doesn't exist for these tweet/reply chains.\nI noticed this earlier when I wanted to add another tweet to the one I had just posted and got exactly what I wanted (a reply to the first tweet, without any mentions), plus an undesired quote.. @mariotaku I see. Just tested again with the current beta, I'll have to keep \"@\u200buser\" and it works as I originally intended. I didn't know you put in that magic, just did the same as always and got confused.\nI've been thinking about how to make it a bit more obvious what gets sent and what is just \"virtual\" text, but didn't come up with an idea.. So it's either streaming or usable poll tweets? Not even an indication that a tweet has an attached poll? Oh silly twitter, more or less enforcing streaming while breaking it facepalm. I shouldn't be surprised, but I still am every time stuff like this shows up.\nIs there a way to manually reload a tweet to get the poll without having to search it in the user's tweets on their profile or opening a reply and then the original tweet? That's especially annoying for retweeted poll tweets, because the retweet doesn't ever have the poll (let me guess: that's another twitter API weirdness).. ",
    "LukasThyWalls": "~~Tested 3.5.0 without any luck.~~\n~~I'm going to downgrade to identify exactly the last working build, and the first non-working.~~\n~~Tell me about to share other useful information. Thanks in advance.~~\nI don't know how i really do, but now it works.\nFirst time using 3.5.0 doesn't do the automatic updates. But in this test i used an imported Twidere Settings, and now i test Twidere cleaning the user data (without uninstalling Twidere) and not using the imported settings. And now seems to work.\nIf i see something strange again i will open this issue but at this point seems to work. Something with old exported Twidere Settings or maybe with app data, but i don't know why with the others tries installing/uninstalling Twidere doesn't work. It isn't the first time with problems with the app data, i normally clean first to test if that fix the problem.\nThank you anyway.. I tried to see if with an old imported settings file (from March 24) something happens, but now it works too with that old settings too. The imported settings doesn't matter for me.\nTwidere has been going update without problem since yesterday, except 40 minutes this afternoon, i don't know why, but now is doing it again. Maybe for using other apps and touching other things, i suppose, but i will be stay tuned.\nThe only trick i can say it has do anything is cleaning the Twidere app data. Quick steps i do yesterday:\n1) Uninstall all Twidere versions. \n2) Install 3.5.0 or lastest (the one i installed yesterday was 3.5.0, i see now there is 3.5.1). \n3) Configure for your account and update tabs to see your timelines. \n4) Clean Twidere app data.\n5) Enter Twidere, the account is still there but any other thing is in default configuration. Configured Twidere like you want, and see if it autoupdates (for me, it did).\nI don't know if this make sense or not... i didn't do anything else different in the others tests.. > What to you mean by Clean Twidere app data.?\nSettings -> Applications -> Twidere -> Clean Data\n(Some modified UIs have other additional steps, but more or less should be the same)\nOnly for pointing out, i always clear all the apps from recent almost every time, and Twidere is still working. I think the no-autoupdate gap from yesterday was the low battery feature, so no problem at the moment.. Since yesterday in the morning, Twidere is not autoupdate itself again. I don't change anything from it. Only yesterday at noon i change 3.5.0 with 3.5.11 to view if it works again, but without any results today.\nI manually update all the tweets today at 12:00am without problems, and since that, i didn't do anything. There isn't any updates since then. It's like the same problem with the original bug.\nI tried to use ADB to dump logcat here. I have the phone connected to computer to ADB and i put logcat since 18:23, when i opened Twidere. At 18:24 I put Keep Screen On App to keep the screen on.

This may cause graphical corruption!\nNow i will disconect the phone, clean data and use again my stored settings to set up Twidere again and see if something changes.\nI hope this helps.\nEdit: I installed the last Twidere, clean twice the data and it did anything. Still i don't have autoupdates.. I will update the subject by all the test i do in the last days, because i can't say the problem is there \"since a concrete version\" because i tested some older versions (Mostly 3.3.35 and 3.4.29) and with them i don't have automatic updates, but i have manual updates. When these versions are the newest i'm sure Twidere was working with autoupdates in my phone, so, there is something else related with Twitter, Options or the phone itself doing Twidere no autoupdate well since mid-late March.\nI will test all the changes of configuration i can with the lastest version to see if i find something clear about this.. Yesterday i think i got the trick.\nI was testing every option in Twidere, if anyone do something different, and now i have autoupdates, and yesterday i made Twidere to go to don't have autoupdates to have autoupdates, twice.\nThis is how i reproduce the problem:\n- I made a clear install of Twidere (or Clean app data of actual installation)\n- I configured it, but i haven't autoupdates (like always, i have manual updates without problem)\n- In configuration -> Automatic Updates, switch off and switch on autoupdates for your account. (I normally tap in my account and use the main switch above all the others)\n- Now, i have autoupdates in Twidere.\nI can do a logcat (like the one above https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/753#issuecomment-293646040) if it's needed.\nPD.: I do this with Twidere 3.5.18\nPD. 2: When this is done, maybe we can talk about how erratic is Twidere with a 5 minutes autoupdate option. Maybe have some relation with the problem, or the limitations with the API, but sometimes updates every 5 minutes, or 7, or 10, or 12, o what it wants. I'm seeing the tweets in official twitter app at the same time to test it and i see this behaviour. Anyway, i never use 5 minutes, i always use 15 minutes, and then seems ok.. I do another test with 3.5.29: exporting settings, cleaning the app data and importing the settings again. It seems to be working now, i don't need to switch off/on the main autoupdates button (only need to switch on the Home tab updates like said in this issue https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/issues/788) but the interactions was updating alone without doing anything and when i switched on the home updates it updated alone without any manual interaction, and are still doing it.. I know this is closed, but until i check a little bit more and create a new one, you should check if could be a similar or related problem to this when it comes from save mode (the Twidere option, it seems the mobile doesn't have anything build-in, but who knows) or when the mobile comes from a period without internet connection (and maybe forgetting to switch off wifi connection in that period without any wifi around, i don't know if that matters). I'm not really sure, but in the last two weeks i have two similar issues to this bug, and maybe are related to those events.. Holy s**t... when i read that question i realized what is the problem...\nYes, I have Firefox, Chrome, Chromium (With this https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=Chromium&fdid=com.dosse.chromiumautoupdater) and Privacy Browser (https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=Privacy+Browser&fdid=com.stoutner.privacybrowser.standard).\nBut when i switch off the \"Chrome Integrated Tab\" option it works again. Anyway, it should open with Chrome (or Chromium? Maybe this is the problem?).. Now with the option enabled or disabled, the open dialog always appears.\nWith the option enabled, if i open the link with Chrome or Chromium, they open only one tab for the content like should be.\nWith the option disabled, If i open the link with Chrome it opens the link like the normal chrome browser with the ability to create new tabs, etc. like should be. Chromium stills uses the one tab configuration.. Ok, sorry.\nI only pointed out that if i pick to use Chromium, it uses the \"integrated tab\", whatever the option is On or Off. It works like should be with Chrome.\nAnd like i have 4 options to open links, it shows me always an open dialog to choose browser, at the beginning i thought this option should open directly the page in chrome, without any dialog.. If \"Chrome custom tabs\" should work with other browsers with this feature and not only Chrome, in that case, Chromium should be respecting the configuration, and now it's opening a \"custom tab\" always, whatever is the configuration in Twidere.\nAnyway, it can be a problem of the build of Chromium (create with this https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=Chromium&fdid=com.dosse.chromiumautoupdater) and not directly Twidere..

Sure, you can check that you get the authorization screen going to yourinstance/oauth and login in. If you get the authorization screen on your browser, then it's not the same issue I had.\nIn my case, a javascript file present in the application template was requiring to be authenticated to be downloaded, and so the login flow for oauth was broken due to that ( authenticate to get the js, then get redirected to the main page instead of the authorization page )..

This issue persists in app ver 3.5.27. Now, the \"public timeline\" (should be \"local timeline\") and \"federated timeline\" both show the local timeline. Both options are prone to failing to load with an undefined \"Network error\" though..

In 3.5.27 there appears to now only be a public timeline, which points to Local. No way to view Federated timeline. So not a total fix but it's progress! . Woops, sorry. I'm not too used to Java.

I love using all my accounts at once but I also get lotsa duplicate posts and sometimes just wanna look at one account. Correct. On Mastodon \"locking\" is simply making it so you have to approve new followers, but post scope/visibility/privacy is still exclusively on a per-post basis (one of the main selling points of Mastodon). Users who lock their accounts usually also change their default scope to \"followers-only\" but they can still, for a specific post, set that one to public in which case that post should be boostable.. Its marked done? Which release is the fix coming out in? I still have this bug. I've been getting this same issue for a long while now. . Even with streaming enabled I only get my mastodon notifications + twitter mentions. No twitter RTs, follows etc..

So I enabled TLS v1.0 in my instance and it works perfectly.\nBut Firefox and other applications work just fine over v1.2, can this be enabled application-wise? I'm not sure if the other instance admin will want to enable v1.0 as that lowers the score of the instance, and the default settings of Mastodon instances enforce v1.2 so I can see this being a common problem for people with old versions of Android.. @mariotaku Sorry I didn't explain myself well. Many Mastodon instances enforce only TLS v1.2.

Vocabulary: \"user\" is too misleading.\nKeep up the good work and I'll most probably support you in the near future! You deserve it.. ",

I think it's related to a common dependency that these three projects have, I'm guessing that the newest build tools could cause a problem.\nIt seems that the part of the android framework that causes a segfault is specific to cyanogenmod and has never been part of AOSP. LineageOS 14 has the same AssetManager code as in AOSP. If it is a problem with newer android Sdk, unfortunately it sounds to me like the definitive end of cyanogenmod and the update to a newer ROM will be mandatory.... @rogers1106 Actually that can be explained, I think that Total Commander tries to read the app's manifest with the android built-in functions which, as explained earlier, raises an error.\n@mariotaku Unfortunately, it's isn't working on my side too.  .

    "pihug12": "Just find out the related bug report: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/64434571\nWorkaround:\n\nIf you need to build with 3.0 but are running into this bug you can disable aapt2 using -Pandroid.enableAapt2=false on the command line when doing your build.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCyanogenMod has this function getPkgName (https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_base/blob/cm-13.0/libs/androidfw/AssetManager.cpp).  It creates a ResXMLTree on the stack and points it at a buffer from an asset without making a copy.  Then it closes the asset before the ResXMLTree is destroyed.\nFor apps built by aapt, this is benign.  However, aapt2 produces UTF-8 string pools, which cause the ResXMLTree's ResStringPool(mStrings)'s mCache to become non-null in ResStringPool::stringAt (https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_base/blob/cm-13.0/libs/androidfw/ResourceTypes.cpp).  Then ResStringPool::uninit dereferences mHeader (which is now dangling), and a crash ensues.\nThis crash shows up in different ways.  On one Cyanogen OS device, the launcher crashes when an app built with aapt2 has been installed, but only if the manifest is large (probably due to how deallocation happens for small vs large blobs).  On another device, system_server crashes at boot if an aapt2-built app is installed.. \n",

I'm not from the US, not being a migrant, and can have access to legal documents. \nIf the way I wrote it is an issue...I'm just speaking english since very few years. \nWhy the heck should it be about me. It's the topic that is relevant, not my words, not even me. \n\nWish you have a wonderful day fighting with \"facism\" and \"censorship\"\nfacism always starts somewhere. Imprisoning kids and pumping them up with drugs...if the resistance isn't getting strong enough that's where their society is heading towards. \nAdding the facism here in ' ' seems like you being ironic about what's happening through ICE.\n\nAnd if the issue is here about me, or my framing, I do NOT matter here, but that microsoft bought github, that microsoft is serving ICE with software, that ICE is...(I said it already), that opensource projects use github giving credibility to microsofts 7.5 billion $ investment...etc.\nBut yes, since you're managing the project it's you who decides what should be seen as relevant to it and what not. \n. \nSome more statements by godwin that I find to be relavant for this discourse related to the 'godwin law', since mariotaku mentioned it:\nhttps://todon.nl/@paulfree14/100244278402109587\n. >And you think I'm privileged?\nI made assumptions with that I shouldn't. I should have asked instead. But I guess what I actully ment (behind the rage I had) was more to reflect on your privilidges, since I believe we all have some.\nI honestly apologize for 'reflect on your privilidged life'. That was manipulative, wrong, offensive....etc. \n. >and just say those doesn't agree with you complicit in taking part of enabling fascism/racism/mass arrest/murder\nThat I found to be very missleading statment since I made a clear (I hoped so) statement about how I believe it's taking part in enabeling. And yes, there will be propably points I'm wrong about, but I'm not calling someone being part in enabeling fascism when they call me wrong on it. \nAbout Microsoft's statment:\nThey are by that taking part in forming a narrative that is about, 'it's only bad because of the seperation'...as in, it's ok to look them up unified. \nmore about microsoft:\n''Microsoft Removes Mention of ICE Cloud Work After Protests\n''On Jan. 24, Tom Keane, a Microsoft executive, wrote a blog post about new contracts with the U.S. Air Force and ICE for the company\u2019s Azure cloud-computing service. Keane touted Azure\u2019s ability to help the agency handle \"sensitive unclassified data\" and use tools such as facial recognition and identification. \"The agency is currently implementing transformative technologies for homeland security and public safety, and we\u2019re proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud,\" Keane wrote in the post.\nAs of Monday morning, the portion of the post mentioning ICE was missing...''\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-18/microsoft-removes-mention-of-cloud-work-for-ice-after-protests\nmore:\nhttps://searx.me/?q=24%20January%20Tom%20Kaene&categories=general&time_range=month&language=en-US\n. >But most of us definitely would stand up to defend humanity, not just by moving data from a platform to another.\nI'm not wanting to define for others what strategy to choose to stand up against fascism. But my proposal was definalty not about moving data from one plattform to another. \nI proposed to use this significant current event to take action through several forms. \nIt could be even a strike during which the project leaves a statement for what reasons they are doing so. \n. '...but that's all just symbolic and doesn't change anything.'\nNo. It has a clear potential of damaging microsofts investment in github and their brand as a whole. It can send a clear message to those wanting to make a profit from this violence. It is also supporting workers within microsoft who have positions against microsoft support of ICE, since it is stregning their position. \nMaking microsoft to step out of ICE contract sends a clear message to those taking direct part in ICE. Right now, microsoft helps them with moral support and support in being legitimate institution. \n. >I suppose you don't use Microsoft own products and services\nI suppose of moving towards this. I'm not not aware of me using beside github any microsoft product. I miss nothing. \nBut of course I know that it's not possible for everyone or even usefull in any situation. \n\nIf not, I honestly think that moving away from Github is useless.\n\nThat's the inviting the logic of, be entire radical or it's anyway worthless. And while we can't be entire radical let's just move on. \nAnd I heaviliy disagree with that. \nIs can you make an argument that is countering what I've wrote here, since you haven't ablied any logic that is proofing mine being wrong. Thought the logical fallacy you ablied here is called whataboutism (I might be wrong on this)\nthis one I ment:\n'It has a clear potential of damaging microsofts investment in github and their brand as a whole. It can send a clear message to those wanting to make a profit from this violence. It is also supporting workers within microsoft who have positions against microsoft support of ICE, since it is stregning their position.\nMaking microsoft to step out of ICE contract sends a clear message to those taking direct part in ICE. Right now, microsoft helps them with moral support and support in being legitimate institution.'\n...there's even more to say, but thought that's enough of an argument. \n\nit would be better to ask and talk in a polite and open posture\n\nyes that might be true. The culture I'm comming from understands the initial issue I wrote as polite and open posture. \nThe answer I resieved as very unpolite, dominant, closed posture...\nSo I adopted my tone to it. \nBut thought the tone shouldn't be much of a matter here, but rather the argument behind. Using it as an argument is known as tone policing:\n'Tone policing (also tone trolling, tone argument and tone fallacy) is an ad hominem and antidebate appeal based on genetic fallacy. It attempts to detract from the validity of a statement by attacking the tone in which it was presented rather than the message itself' -wiki\n\n...rather than saying that anyone who doesn't move away from Github is ok with fascism.\n\n(that's part of the tone policing)\nI didn't. I said and still hold this up, complicit. In case I'm using this word wrong, or different then ppl are used to:\nOne can be against fascism while still having thirten behaviours that is supporting it, and by that being complicit in some aspects. So as you said, it's not just black and white. \nIt was also used in relation of the disource here:\n\nme pointing out opressive behaviour ppl have an issue with, that is done by a company behind the plattform that is also used for twidere to collaborate on code\nmariotaku direct respond to it, stating it's unrelevant spam, calling to report me if I do it again and closed it\n\n. >If you want a company to change something to that level, people need to take action in almost all use cases they have rather than in a few.\nI don't believe that. But also if true, it anyway makes sense to turn against any of their products and it isn't any counter argument to what I've stated. If I need to plant 10 seeds to have enough plants to eat, it still starts with planting one. \nThey reseave already public pressure, also internal by their workers. Doing an action on github is just one part of it. \nIf that doesn't make microsoft to change their desicion, their can be still many that are changing their decision of using microsoft and by that having impact on the longterm. \n\nFor example, Google cancelled a military contract because of a lot of protests and resignations of their own employees, not because the end users.\n\nIt's usefull to help the employees strenghening their positions. If they couldn't win it through the moral arguments alone, economic reasoning can help, and so can the enduser. \nAlso protests and endusers do have an impact on the employees themself. They can be motivational for the employees to take action within their company. \n\nBut I think that if you move away from Github,...\n\nalso remember that I'm not calling for simply moving away. I'm calling to use github for antifascist action.\n...and this is even not just about microsoft. \nImagine many projects on github start to strike for some days and using it during that time to discuss, share research, publish statements about microsoft, their involvment in ICE, but also about the freedom of movment, open society etc. \nThat can have a significant impact. But it's all a question if some projects will start and inspire other by it. \n. >it would had been better to simply ask in a polite way - without any activism - if this projects considers moving to some other repository.\nI don't understand why I should ask something else then that what I want to know. \nJust to make this very clear:\nI'm asking if people are willingly to resist the violence that is conducted by ICE with support from micosoft, the company behind github. \nThis polite thing is in general confusing me. Can someone point me where my initial issue is conflicting with it? \n. thx @orithena for this reply. I read and ment my initial post definatly very different. \nEven reading it again (initial post), I simply can't understand where ppl see it as unpolite or understanding it as 'be with me or against me'. \nBut some ppl gave now similiar feedback, so I gonna reflect on what went wrong between me writing the message and the resievers. \n\nbut please reconsider your view on the backlash to your proposal.\n\nthx for that hint. On the same wanting to point this the other way, cause of the 'irrelevant spam' reply on a topic that highly emotional charged. \n\ndefensiveness creates and hardens arguments opposite your intentions.\n\nNot nessasary. I think the phenomen you're mentioning here is called 'backfire effect'. \n''The Misconception: When your beliefs are challenged with facts, you alter your opinions and incorporate the new information into your thinking.\nThe Truth: When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronge''\nhttps://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/\n\nFollowing the original premise consequentially would mean to denounce every entity that did trade with a \"bad guy\"\n\nI understand where you're argument of 'where to draw the line' is comming from. Everyone has to draw it for themself. I draw it somewhere else then others. Others draw them somewhere else then me. And that's even good. \nAnd that's not contradicting with my initial statement. Following my initial statements does not mean to do all at one. It's more about keeping current events in mind and aplying to them usefull strategies. \nNot simply mine, but multible with everyone making their own choices. \nSo it's not contradicting with people having different lines, which is what your statement is based on. (if I understood it correct)\nWith what it is contradicting and where it makes a hard line is, that \n'giving value to institutions that are complicit in supporting forced mass detention etc. is bad'\nThat is the core argument after passing it through Occam's razor. \nI don't see any argument being made why it should be from here about weather whataboutsim or slipperslope since there is obviously also the option of: yes, this statement is true until a contradicting logical argument can be made. \nFrom this point it could be then rather about disagrement about the aplied strategy..etc.\nIn short meaning, you've limited the available options and formed your reasoning based on those, that are obviously both shitty options, that then formed an argument looking as it contradicts mine. \n(if one can remember the name of this fallacy I'd be interested in)\n\n@mariotaku chose his line. Let him.\n\nJust in case it looks as I'm continue to argue here for the sake of making mariotaku changes their position, I'm not. \nIt's for the reason of other devs. that might read this thread, and to find out what's wrong/should be better about my initial message since I still believe it is something that can be done with little efford and still be a meaningfull resistance against ICE and microsoft, mostly caused by the circumstances such as:\n- there is already great outrage\n- microsoft employees take positions against the ICE deal\n- microsoft just bought github for 7.5 billion $ \n- microsoft being behind github is unpopular by many opensource devs. \n- there are free software alternatives to github that funtion great\n- microsoft tried to hide their ICE involvment\n.

    "cmmata": "@PaulFree14 so I suppose you don't (ever) use Microsoft own products and services like Windows, Office, Outlook.com, Wunderlist, LinkedIn, Azure cloud, VS Code, Skype, Xbox and Microsoft games, and many others...\nAnd also don't use any opensource project where Microsoft contributes like Linux kernel, or any service hosted in Azure platform.\nIf not, I honestly think that moving away from Github is useless.\nAnyway I'm with @annando, it would be better to ask and talk in a polite and open posture, rather than saying that anyone who doesn't move away from Github is ok with fascism. It's not always black or white, there are a lot of greys.. > If not, I honestly think that moving away from Github is useless.\nWell, I don't mean to be necessary 100% radical. But I think that if you move away from Github, but continue using other Microsoft services or other services using Microsoft's cloud, your impact wouldn't be bigger enough to be a significant change to Microsoft. If Microsoft sees that everybody is moving away from Github, the next step would be selling it or directly shutting it down. I don't see Microsoft changing that kind of decisions just because one service is not making money or doesn't have enough users. If you want a company to change something to that level, people need to take action in almost all use cases they have rather than in a few. For example, Google cancelled a military contract because of a lot of protests and resignations of their own employees, not because the end users.. @mariotaku If your new job has a \"normal\" work schedule, you made a great change only for that. We work to live, not live to work. So congrats! I'm a daily user of Twidere, so I'm glad to see you want to dedicate more time on the project. And if you still haven't much time to it, you could always have some contributors lending a hand or two.\nIf you want, I could help triaging issues or with easy development, as at the moment I'm a beginner in Android development..
