Unfortunately it is not possible to disable or destroy the Places Autocomplete after it was created:\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#places_autocomplete\n. When you use the location option, the plugin will try to find an address for that location. If it is a string \"lat,lng\" then the geocoder will do a reverse lookup which might result in slightly different location.\nTry to use mapOptions.center if you just want to set the original position:\njs\nmapOptions: {\n    center: setloc\n}\n. Okay, my fault: In the docs it says, that you can pass a LatLng value to the location.\nI'll have to update the plugin to not reverse geocode the location:\nhttps://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete/blob/master/jquery.geocomplete.js#L219\n. Share it via Twitter, G+ or your blog. And feel free to fork and improve it! \nThat would be the best way to keep this alive.\n. Can you provide some more details (eg. a link or sample code)?\n. Feel free to submit a pull request. I'll have a look if I can merge it into the main project.\n. @ficho: Is this example working for you?\nhttp://ubilabs.github.com/geocomplete/examples/form.html\n. This is currently not possible. Will add it to the enhancement list.\n. The geocoder always uses the clients locale. To override this, add the language parameter to the Google Maps API script.\nFor more informations rad this: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/basics#Localization\nExample:\nhtml\n<script src=\"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&language=ja\" type=\"text/javascript\" ></script>\n. Hey Heera,\nyou can access all properties by passing the name as an argument:\njs\nvar marker = $(\"#my_input\").geocomplete(\"marker\");\nconsole.log(marker.getPosition()); // logs the current position.\n. Can you provide some more details like sample code or a detailled error message?\n. Hey MrFoto:\nYou can already do this by adding position to the markerOptions:\njs\nthis.geocomplete({\n  map: '#map', \n  location: defLocation, \n  markerOptions: {\n    draggable: true,\n    position: defLocation\n  }\n});\n. Hey Jose,\nyou have to manually call the find method to update the details:\njs\n$input.geocomplete(\"find\", lat + \",\" + lng);\n. See https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete/issues/27\n. You can add any options to the plugin map constructor via mapOptions. \nTo add new controls, simply pass the options like this.\njs\n$(\".yourtextbox\").geocomplete({\n    mapOptions: { \n      panControl: false,\n      zoomControl: false,\n      scaleControl: true \n    },\n    //...other args\n});\nMore infos here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/controls#Adding_Controls_to_the_Map\n. Nice!\n. That should be no problem! \nEG:\njs\n$(\"#geocomplete\").geocomplete(\"find\", \"Juliusstra\u00dfe 25, Hamburg\");\n. If Google has information about that place, it will return street number.\nTry http://ubilabs.github.com/geocomplete/examples/form.html with \"Fernsehturm Berlin\".\n. This is not possible for now.\nFeel free to tweak the code around Line 196:\nhttps://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete/blob/master/jquery.geocomplete.js#L196\n. Thanks for the additions! And feel free to tweak the docs ;)\n. Just add the key to the script tag.\nSee: \n- Obtaining an API Key\n- Hello, World\n. To get the map, call:\njs\nmap = $(\"#geocomplete\").geocomplete(\"map\")\nmap.setZoom(3);\n. Did you try to set the language parameter in the Google Maps API script?\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/basics#Language\n. This should be fixed with the latest commit.\n. Unfortunately we can't change this behaviour. The Google geocoder and the places search sometimes return different results.\n. Can you please provide an example? I'll close this until we have more information.\n. Firefox Android was not on the list of supported browsers. \nSee: https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#browsersupport\n. Thanks for the addition! \nI use UglifyJS to create the minified version. And can you please set autoselect: false as the default?\n. Okay, I've merged your fork and updated the build.sh script. We now have version version 1.5 thanks to you!\n. Thanks for the hint!\n. You can get and resize the map by calling\njs\nvar map = $(\"#geocomplete\").geocomplete(\"map\");\ngoogle.maps.event.trigger(map, \"resize\");\n. Thank you!\n. You can do this by setting the options on the map or maker.\njs\nvar map = $(\"#geocomplete\").geocomplete(\"map\");\n...\nmap.setOptions({ draggable: false });\nRead more here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapOptions\n. Google Maps changed the behaviour of maps without a center.\nMake sure to pass center as an option or call setCenter on the map.\n. Should be fixed with the latest update. See: http://ubilabs.github.io/geocomplete/examples/form.html\n. But that is the expected behaviour! If you just search for a location, the ZIP code is not returned, as it might contain multiple codes. When you pass a street, the ZIP is provided.\nI'm going to close this issue as we have no control over the results from the Google APIs.\n. Just pass a styles property to the mapOptions and icon to markerOptions.\nSee: https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete#list-of-options\n. See this example: http://ubilabs.github.io/geocomplete/examples/form.html\n. Perfect!\n. Closing this until we have more info.\n. This is currently not supported by the Google Places API.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks, but unfortunately this isn't that easy, as the format of street addresses is not always street_number route. It is correct for US, but in Germany it would be the other way around.\n. This should only happen, when running the files from the local file system.\n. I can't see your CSS. Have you set an height for the map container?\n. This is currently not supported. The Google Places Autocomplete always displays the country at the end. \n. Please provide some more info:\n- Do you use post processors?\n- Can you check, if the HTML is correct?\n- Can you provide a link to the application? \n. I'll close this until we have more information.\n. Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment.\n. Thanks for the hints! I've updated all version numbers and created a new release 1.6.4.\n. @christopher-hopper Not sure what exactly you are missing here. Check this URLs for the releases:\nhttps://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete/releases\n. Here you go: https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete/releases/latest \u2013 Hope that helps!\n. Looks like this is an issue with the Places Library: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete\n. @diazruy Ok! I was wondering why I didn't saw it here. Ping me, when you are done with that.\nThanks!\n. Thanks or this!\n. Not sure about google.maps.event.clearInstanceListeners because it might cause some side effects. But I'll merge it and hope it will work for you!\n. D'oh (x.x).\n. @smcclstocks Done\n. Looks great! Only one comment \u2026\n. Looks great and I really appreciate your help!\n. That is the right question!\n. Thanks for the Meteor package! But tell me: What do you need here? Please provide some more info (eg. text to put into the Readme).\n. Sorry, but you can't use the Google Maps API without an internet connection.\n. This is because a ZIP  code must be unique to show up in the field. \nAs \"New York City\" has a wide range of zip codes, we can't show it.\n. Very hard, if not impossible.\n. Thanks: Simple, but nice!\n. I like it! Thanks for that...\n. If you also show a Google Map, it is OK to hide the logo:\nhttps://developers.google.com/places/webservice/policies#logo_requirements\nYou can hide it using CSS:\ncss\n.pac-container:after {  /* Disclaimer: not needed to show 'powered by Google' if also a Google Map is shown */\n    background-image: none !important;\n    height: 0px;\n}\n. This is a great suggestion! Thanks for the work!\n. Thanks for the hint! It is now available here:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/geocomplete\n. Many thanks for the fix!\n. Thanks and sorry for the long wait!\n. Thanks! I've merged that manually into the docs.\n. Thank you for the quick fix!\n. It is not. But I've updated both versions to 1.7. \n. As of June 22, 2016 Google made the following changes to the Google Maps APIs Standard Plan:\n\nGoogle Maps no longer support keyless access (any request that doesn't include an API key). Future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key. API keys allow Google to contact developers when required and help us identify misbehaving implementations.\n\nhttp://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.de/2016/06/building-for-scale-updates-to-google.html\n. Please register your key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key\n. Please open the Crome Dev Tools console and check, what they are saying. Usually it should give you some advice how to fix it.\n. Done. Thanks for the hint!\n. Closing this, because of missing description.. This is not possible, because the Google Maps API limits this to 5 results.. This is true for \"text search requests\" but looks like, AutoComplete is not affected: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#AutocompleteOptions. You have to make sure, that the Google Maps API was loaded before the Geocomplete script. So, first wait until the Google Maps API is loaded and then include your this file. This is a pure JS plugin. We won't add server or DB support.. We can't do anything about that. This is how Google returns the data.. No, Google does not return a geoid.. This is a known bug on Google's site and should be fixed, soon: \nhttps://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=11253&q=setComponentRestrictions&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Introduced%20Fixed%20Summary%20Stars%20ApiType%20Internal.

Triggering the geocoder via javascript as in examples such as:\n$(\"#examples a\").click(function(){\n    $(\"input[name=geo_autocomplete]\").val($(this).text()).trigger(\"geocode\");\n    return false;\n  });\nreturns a limited result set compared to selecting the same location manually. For example, the \"name\" attribute is occasionally populated, when when triggered via js.\n. I did some experiments on this. When a location is selected from the autocomplete list, request sent to the geocoding service is a PlaceService.GetPlaceDetails request with the location's ID. This returns the full result set. When geocoding is triggered via javascript giving a place name, even if the name is an exact match to the full name, the generated request is a GeocodeService.Search request, which returns a subset of the GetPlaceDetails request.\nApparently, the autocomplete drop-down has the ID of the location and builds the request based on that. But, as far as I can see, that ID is not provided in the results of a GeocodeService.Search request. So, making a search query, getting the id, and making another getDetails query won't seem to work neither. \nAny suggestions?\n. to get all the details, GetPlaceDetails should be called with the place id. there may be a way to query the geocoding service with name and retrieve the ID and then make the GetPlaceDetails request, i am not sure. otherwise, with the place name, you would do a GeocodeService.Search request and get a limited result about a place. at the time i was working on that, the id was not provided. it is probably still the same. good luck, and i'd appreciate if you share any updates on that. \n.

If you want to populate your page (form fields and map) with the data belonging to a place already stored from a previous geocomplete, you could do use the Google Places reference and do something like this (sorry, it's coffeescript):\n```\nSet the location from a Google Places reference\nupdateLocationFromReference: (map, reference) ->\n  service = new google.maps.places.PlacesService(map) \n  service.getDetails({reference: reference}, (place, status) =>\n    if (status == google.maps.places.PlacesServiceStatus.OK)\n      # Set your fields here \u2026\n      @geocomplete_field.geocomplete('update', place)\n  )\n```\nThis code basically fetches the places details for your reference from google and updates geocomplete with it.\n.

I agree that different regions need different street address formats. Addresses are one of the largest headaches I've come across. I think it would be a good option for a user of this plugin to be able to fill the desired form field with the street address of their choice. I would propose to either offer multiple format types, such as street_number_route, route_street_number, etc., or give the option for multiple types in the data attribute on the input. For example, data-geo=\"street_number route\" which would fill with \"123 Main St\" or data-geo=\"route street_number\" which would fill with \"Main St 123\". It at least still gives the option for the user of the plugin to use the street address in the format they choose. I think the second option is cleaner. If either option is something you'd like to merge into the plugin, I'll see what I can do to get it done. \n. ",

That way it could be downloaded from a Latest Geocomplete Release URL and show up as a Latest Release link on the Geocomplete Releases page of Github. \nThere is an API so you can create Github releases from the command-line or a build script. Another benefit is that you can add some notes to the release, to let people know if there are any issues or changes they should be particularly aware of. You already do a changelog.txt, but the release notes can be a summary or just the most important note from the changelog. \nWhat we want to do, is create an easy way to grab the latest release of your library for use with Drupal. \nFurther reading on my suggested solution can be found at:\n- Creating releases \n- Linking to the latest release\n. @aemkei to demonstrate what I'm talking about, I've taken a fork of the library and created a published release. Compare the links below to see the difference. \nForked Version: \n- christopher-hopper Geocomplete Releases\n- Note this releases/latest path now takes me to the latest release for download. \nOriginal Version:\n- ubilabs Geocomplete Releases\n- Note this releases/latest path takes me to a list of every possible tag. \nWhy publish your releases? Let me try to explain.\nWhen you publish a release, it allows users of your library to use the URL path releases/latest to access the latest published release without knowing the exact version number. \nYour current releases list is just a list of tags. It doesn't indicate which is the current or latest release. I have to parse the list to work that out. Essentially the releases page offers no value. \nI wanted to code up a download and install of your library. I would like to know that if I request releases/latest I will get the latest release without having to parse a list of every tag, then pick the one that was either most recently pushed, or that has the highest version number, or whatever. \nThis is the primary reason behind the Github release page and is why Github provides both a releases page and a tags page. \nTake a look at:\n- Creating releases\n- Linking to the latest release\n.

I suppose you could do something like a section at the end called \"3rd Party Install Options\" with a subheading for Meteor (like a lot of projects do for NPM, Bower, and Gems).  The install for Meteor is just meteor add jeremy:geocomplete and the Meteor specific usage docs are in my README.  \nAs an example, the guys that made the Materialize framework did something like that for Ruby/Meteor/Ember at the bottom of their getting started page.\nSo maybe...\nThird Party Install Options\nMeteor\nbash\nmeteor add jeremy:geocomplete\nMeteor-specific usage docs here.\n. I'm not sure this is an issue.  There are only so many results a given search can display at a time.  I also suspect your missing results could possibly have something to do with the IP based biasing that the Google Places API uses by default.\n\nNote: If you do not supply the location and radius, the API will attempt to detect the user's location from their IP address, and will bias the results to that location.

In order to achieve this, you would have to implement the dropdown yourself and use google.maps.places.PlacesService (which I presume is what Autocomplete uses under the hood), which will give access to the PlacesServiceStatus, which will indicate when there are no results.\nSorry for the incorrect \"fix\" I intially provided.

Nothing special there.

    "johnrees": "@ivanhalen you need to specify a country's ALPHA-2 code.\nAssuming you're in the US, based on @shashank-saxena's answer your snipped would now become $('.geocomplete').geocomplete({country: \"US\", type: ['(regions)']})\nThere's an open issue dating back to 2012 asking Google to support multiple countries, https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=4233\nI hope I'm wrong but it looks like country is the largest 'area' that you can filter with https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#GeocoderComponentRestrictions. Ah nice find @fwerner13 Yes that's working for me. Thanks. ",
    "fwerner13": "But what if you do not want to limit the country?\nI think this solution would be better: https://github.com/Mukhilan/geocomplete/commit/e0483797f002e07502b9333451e766bf2d72a634. ",

Just [] will not work from v=3.27 and newer.\n\nSeems like this component should be updated to support the new format.. ",
