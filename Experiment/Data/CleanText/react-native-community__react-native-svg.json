    "magicismight": "@antoxi4 \nThis library is based on React Native`s ART, and this feature is not supported by ART right now.\nSee #5510\nWe can just wait for the official fix landed on ART.\nBTW: Sorry for not replying this in time,I was on vocation.\n. Oh.\nThat PR mentioned before is the one you sended.\nThanks for this. hope it would landed on ART soon.\n:+1:\n. @gordonpro  ReactART\n. Get it fixed bases on your PR.\nBut react-native-art-svg on the npm has changed to react-native-svg.\nAnd it is no longer using ReactNativeArt as its dependency, you have to link the native code inside react-native-svg\n. Thanks for informing this.\nIt has been fixed in there\n. Cant do that in react-native.\nSVG like other components in react-native.\nIt cant set dimensions style in percent.\n. Thanks for this PR. :+1: \n. Thanks for reporting this issue.\ngradients only supports iOS for now.It wont work on Android util [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/5729) be merged into react-native\nAlso see [#5510](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5510)\n. Sorry, Im not familiar with native code on Android.\nI can not help you with that.\nWe can just wait the official fix for this.\nBut it seems like they are not so interested in ART,there are lots of TODOs in ART code.\nAnd they are never changed since ART is being open sourced\n. It has been fixed now.\nBut react-native-art-svg on the npm has changed to react-native-svg\nAnd it is no longer using ReactNativeArt as its dependency, you have to link the native code inside react-native-svg\n. style, opacity,viewbox and preserveAspectRatio\nSvg element is based on ARTs Surface element\n. You can setwithandheight` of Svg by using variables.\n```\nlet height = 100;\nlet width = 100;\n\n\n\n``\n. After 2.0.0 you can use flex layout on Svg element.\nAnd other props owned by View elements.\n.both of them can work.\n. Yep..\nART do not support this feature on Android right now.\n. Finished this feature inreact-native-svg@1.1.0You can change the package name fromreact-native-art-svgtoreact-native-svg, and link the native code inside,this will work.\n. This feature has completed.\nAnd this package name has changed toreact-native-svgand furthermore it is not based on ReactNativeART anymore.\nYou can update toreact-native-svgand link the native library inside.\n. Thanks. :+1: \n. We usestrokeLinecapinstead ofstrokeCap.\nBecausestroke-linecapis a valid svg attribute not stroke-cap.\nAnd it is supported onreact-native-svg@1.1.0both android and iOS.\n. BTW\nThis package has changed name toreact-native-svgnow.\nAnd it is no longer based on ReactNativeART\n. Whichreact-native-svg` version did you installed?\n And did you install by npm2? or npm3?\n. \nstrokeLinecap works fine on android.\nYou can try the example code.\n```\nimport Svg, {\n    Path,\n    Rect,\n    G,\n    Defs,\n    Stop,\n    RadialGradient,\n    Polyline,\n    ClipPath,\n    Circle,\n    Text\n} from 'react-native-svg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nMaybe you imported the elements from the old react-native-art-svg instead of react-native-svg?\n. Which component did you used?\nAnd the art module issue is fixed by now,\nThx for reporting this to me.\nI will release those fixes to npm by next Monday. \n. I will fix this soon.\n. Good find!\n:+1: \nGet it be fixed in last commit\n. This feature need ART support.\nSorry, cant help you with this right now.unless official support is landed on ART.\n. Im working on it now.\nThe react-native-art-svg has changed name to react-native-svg.\nAnd it is no longer rely on ReactNativeART any more.\n. It has been fixed on react-native-svg@1.1.0.\n. No.\nI don`t think svg sprites will be a good idea in React Native.\nIt will cause much more unnecessary paint in the native code.\nBTW:\nThis package name has changed into react-native-svg.\nAnd it is no longer based on ReactNativeART any more.\nYou can install react-native-svg and link the native code inside.\nreact-native-svg supports more features while ART dont have.\n. Sorry about that.\nI have just movedreact-native-art-svgtoreact-native-svg.\nIll fix this later.\n. @MoOx Good idea :+1: \nJust did that.\n. react-native-svg no longer use ART as dependency now.\nYou should link the native code inside. \nOr use rnpm to link the library: rnpm link react-native-svg\n. No.\nJust support rnpm for now\n. Yep.\nIts a good idea.\nBut Im not so familiar with cocoapods.Ill try this later.\n. Fixed\n. Thx for this PR\n:+1: \n. :+1: \nThanks for this PR\n. Thx for reporting this.\ngot this fixed in 1.1.2\n. Thx for reporting this issue.\nFix released in @1.1.2\n. Fair enough\nThanks for this PR.\n. I see.\nThis have been fixed.\nThanks for reporting this.\n. Fix will be released to npm tomorrow.\nIm closing this issue now.\n. Thx for reporting this.\nThis has been fixed in 1.2.3\n. Its a bug while serializing path.\nIt will go wrong while process something like this:1-2.078.991But got it been fixed in1.2.4Thx for reporting this.\n. Thx for this PR\n:+1: \n. Sorry\nI didnt notice that you have used the wrong prop stop-color.\nWe use camel case as a prop name like: stopColor.\nAnd there is something wrong with warning in Gradient elements, Ill fix that later.\n. If the issue still persists.\nFeel free to reopen this.\n. Thx for reporting this.\n:+1: \n. Done.\n. I think this have been fixed in 2.0.0\nEverthing works fine on 0.25.1 and 0.26.0.\nSo Im closing this.\n. Everything works fine on react-native-svg@1.2.6 + react-native@0.24.0\n<Svg height=\"80\" width=\"225\">\n            <Path\n                d='M0 0 L0 100'\n                fill='none'\n                stroke='red'\n                strokeDasharray='3,3'\n                strokeLinecap='butt'\n                opacity='0.5'\n            />\n </Svg>;\n. Im closing this.\nFeel free to reopen this.\n. Its very difficult to attach touch events on current code.The Svg element is more like a canvas not a truly container for some shape elements.\nThe shape elements inside Svg, like(Circle, Path etc..) are some kind of virtual nodes, they`re abstractions of the paint on the canvas.\nFor example\n<Svg>\n    <Rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" />\n</Svg>\nThe Rect element is just a virtual node. It wont layout itself, It just draw a rectangle on the Svg canvas context.So its very difficult to attach events on a node which is not existed on layout system.\nBut Ill try my best to refactor whole library to support the touch events, thanks for the awesome suggestion anyway.\n. I think I did it on iOS.\nThis will be released within the next major version.\nIll feature out how to implement this on Android.\n. The gesture responder system added in a new branch named touch-events, which is not finished yet on Android.\nThose handlers are supported\nonMoveShouldSetResponder\nonMoveShouldSetResponderCapture\nonResponderGrant\nonResponderMove\nonResponderReject\nonResponderRelease\nonResponderTerminate\nonResponderTerminationRequest\nonStartShouldSetResponder\nonStartShouldSetResponderCapture\nIm planning to implement touchable handlers on some new elements like:\nTouchableCircle\nTouchableRect \n...etc\nIm not sure if this is a good idea to add those new elements\n. Cant find a way to dispatch touch events to ReactShadowNode on Android.\nBeen working on this for days.\nAny ideas?\n. Im closing this issue now, for the gesture responder system is shiped within react-native-svg@2.0.0.\nFeel free to reopen this issue.\n. The doc is out of date for ages.\nBut Ill update the doc later.\nAnd will add some examples for this.\n. I have no idea about what happened here.\nAnd we are no longer depend on ReactNativeART anymore\n. I'm not sure if [this ART commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/9486) is related with this problem.\nBut I'll get this merged into react-native-svg see what would happen.\n. @dacarley  Sorry about that,I'll get that commit merged today.\n. I'm working on it, found it's not that easy to get that commit merged into svg.\nIt have to change the SvgView into a subclass from TextureView.\nThat introduces many new problems.\n. We have changed the SvgView into a subclass from ViewGroup insteadof View for some reasons.\nSo that changed many things.\n. @mlabrum \nThere are something went wrong with the Image, TouchEvents and onDataURL().\nMaybe will be finished in 2 days.\nBut I cannot guarantee this.\n. @dacarley DONE.\nReleased in react-native-svg@4.3.2\nBut I'm not sure if [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6760) has been fixed, can't find a way to test it.\n. This is  still a known issue in ReactNativeART and react-native-svg.\nI have no idea what's going wrong.\nmaybe it's the parsed path data send to JSBridge caused the problem.\nI'll try to parse thedprop in native side and see what happened.. Good news!\nI have fixed this finally.\nIt's the JSBridge caused the crash.\nThedprop in Path element is too large after serialized.\nAnd I had moved the serialize part to java side, and it never throwA/libc: Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2, fault addr 0x9fa40028 in tid 4388 (mqt_js)again.\nI'll ship this fix in next version\n. I have pushed the commits to a [new branch](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/path-native-parser).\nNow just have finished the Android code and will finish the iOS code in maybe this weekend.. 4.6.0 has been released.\nAnd I think it's time to close this issue now.\nThe crash caused byA/libc: Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2, fault addr 0xxxxxxxx in tid xxxx (mqt_js)has been fixed.\nThe crash caused by other errors should be posted in other issues.\n. Thx for this PR\n:+1: \n. Fixed in #41 .\nThanks for reporting this.\nIm closing this issue now\n. Thx for this PR\n:+1: \n. @chunghe \nThx for this useful suggestion.\nIll find a way to work this out for both 0.25.0 above an 0.24.0\n. Its totally a mess after the dependencies changed after 0.25.0 !\nIll fix this later.\nHave to change lots of code to work this out.\n. Im closing this now.\nBecause the related code are no longer existed on the latest version\n. I have fixed this in the next release.\nNo longer use createReactNativeComponentClass any more.\nimport createReactNativeComponentClass from react/lib/createReactNativeComponentClass\nwont work in 0.25.1 and 0.24.0.\nGot anthor workaround to do this instead.\n. Im closing this because the react-native-svg@2.0.0 is released just now.\nI have found another way to work this out, no longer use createReactNativeComponentClass anymore.\nThe workaround in the latest code is not a pretty one, but will work both on react-native@0.26.0 and below.\n. Thanks for this PR anyway.\n:+1: \n. Yep.\nFix will be released within 2.0.0 tomorrow.\nMy hands are full for now\n. 2.0.0 releasd.\nIm closing this issue now.\nFeel free to reopen this if the bug still exist.\n.

Thanks for reporting this.\nWe have to run hitTest for every element in SVG util find a correct target element,\nbecause for some case like this:\n\nIf you just bind an onPress callback on the circle but do not run the hitTest method for the Rect element.\nThe onPress callback will be called when press on the Rect area inside circle.\nI'll try to improve this later, I'm working on the Text elements refactoring those days.\n. 1. calculate and cache the boundingBox for every elements inside SVG.\n2. test if the touch point is inside boundingBox before run the test on bitmap.\n. You can find the example here\n. Awesome!\nI'll try to get this included into react-native-svg after I finish the Text elements refactoring.\n. Can you provide some code to reproduce it?\n. This has been fixed in 5.1.1.. I'm sorry I cannot help with this right now, I'm quite busy those days. I'll try to get this reviewed next week.\n.

I don't think a fade-in transition in SVG is a right choice.\nBut the events would be great.. Oh, I see.\nBut I have some trouble to add those features on iOS.\nI don't know how to add listeners to those events.\nI just used _image = CGImageRetain([RCTConvert CGImage:src]); to get the image.

You can use Text component now on both Android an iOS.\nexample\nAnd the TSpan TextPath will be supported in next version, maybe in next week.. You can cache the BASE64 data for the Svg, and use it in Image component.\nsvgRef. toDataURL((base64) => {\n    // console.log(\"The base64 data for the svg:\", base64);\n});. The package name in android has been changed in 4.6.0, sorry about that . You can convert the base64 to PNG format by using other libraries.\nIt's not what this library do, I'm sorry I can't help you with that.\nAnd for SVG, you can traverse through all children inside Svg component, and serialize them into a string, this is not a bad idea. I'll add this to my TODO list.. Just released 4.5.0 which is supported for react-native@0.40.0. Fix is release in 5.1.1. Thanks for this PR. \ud83d\udc4d .

    "ipmcc": "I hit this problem too. And FWIW, I've had no problem specifying height and width using percents in other React Native components. The problem with the Svg element here is that it deliberately sanitizes the height and width parameters, with this code in render():\n```\n        const {opacity, width, height, viewBox, preserveAspectRatio, style, ...props} = this.props;\n        let dimensions;\n    if (width && height) {\n        dimensions = {\n            width: +width,\n            height: +height,\n            flex: 0\n        };\n    }\n\n```\nI'm guessing that the + coerces the value to a number, making percent values into NaN.

I think rewriting to use VectorDrawable would be more work than just re-inventing their wheel and adding a bitmap cache per shadow node, or perhaps only on the G nodes. But, i'm not sure if it's worth the memory / computational cost tradeoff. Would need better performance tests and measurements to base that kind of decisions on. Would you have any available?. As @evollu is suggesting we should merge the changes from here: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/9486\nAnd, we could add a cached attribute to the G element, to allow opt-in bitmap caching of subtrees, so use-case dependent memory/computation tradeoffs can be tailored for.. Actually, I now realize that the Svg element is probably the correct place for a texture/bitmap cache. This allows deciding the size and clipping of it together with a viewbox properly.. I've ported the changes from the PR to ReactNativeART, to use a TextureView in Android https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/commits/f3ea54cd26676013254ce133dd355f2ff1a3d57d\nAny help in testing would be much appreciated \ud83d\udc83 . The TextureView was causing issues, I reset the branch to point before the commit for the PR. I think the other optimisations seem stable/functional.. There is support for animation with useNativeDriver now and the code has been optimized for unitless numbers instead of strings, try using that, and if you have static parts in the animation, split it up into three different svgs, a static background, animated layer and a static foreground, such that the animated parts are as computationally small and few as possible. And utilize shouldComponentUpdate / PureComponent where possible. These principles should enable relatively smooth animations for most usecases. Also, you probably want to upgrade javascriptcore in android, I've seen massive speedups from that. . If you're still having performance issues, you should probably profile your code and find your bottlenecks and attempt to optimize those. There's not much to be done here without specific problematic cases. Closing.... I have a PR open fixing this: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596. Press handling with transforms should be working correctly now.. Keeping this in a separate library probably makes sense, as it's not critical to svg rendering, and not always needed.. I've made a library for zoom-and-pan https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg\nSimilar logic could be used to add https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/interact.html#ZoomAndPanAttribute. @lai32290 Do you have the latest version of react-native-cli? Try npm i -g react-native-cli\nWorked just fine yesterday at least: https://github.com/msand/AwesomeProject/commits/master. If someone is interested in working on this, they can probably get some inspiration from how the mask element was implemented recently: \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/46307ecd2d2eb6849c0cb2465106201cb9901dda\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/b88cba85a41ee5af58e248674dfba3343430a014\nIn order to compute the mask for blending the images, it implements and uses the luminanceToAlpha type of feColorMatrix filter:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/#element-attrdef-fecolormatrix-type\nsvg\n<filter id=\"luminanceToAlpha\" filterUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\">\n<feColorMatrix id=\"luminance-value\" type=\"luminanceToAlpha\" in=\"SourceGraphic\"/>\n</filter>\nios:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/b88cba85a41ee5af58e248674dfba3343430a014/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m#L215-L228\nandroid:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/46307ecd2d2eb6849c0cb2465106201cb9901dda/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableShadowNode.java#L269-L286\nIt would probably make sense to look into doing the filters on the gpu, but a plain cpu implementation just to get some support for it might already prove useful to some use cases.. Essentially it entails adding some logic where it now renders to the current context; to instead check if the current element has the filter attribute set, if so: create a map initialised to have the SourceGraphic bitmap, then compute the output of each filter primitive in the referenced filter element in order and store the outputs in the map with the ids as the keys. Then rendering the final output instead. Blending is also demonstrated by the mask logic.. @glthomas Great to hear :) The react part of it is relatively small, most of the work will probably be around implementing the bitmap filters on android and ios. Could possibly use GPUImage or GPUImage2 or plain core image on ios, and one of the gpuimage ports or renderscript on android. Alternatively, plain cpu based implementations in java and obj-c might be good enough for most static use cases, and at least simpler to get the build environment set up. Or how experienced are you in c++? . Actually, if you only need blur, then at least on android it's possible to implement it using https://developer.android.com/reference/android/renderscript/ScriptIntrinsicBlur\nand on iOS https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIGaussianBlur\nIn this case, quite a bit of the work is actually just with setting up the new elements, the filter attribute, and then possibly a comparable amount of work for setting the source graphic, processing the blur, and merging the bitmaps, but all of it should be doable without adding any dependencies and all quite similar to the work with implementing the mask element and attribute.\nQuite a few other filters (e.g. the luminanceToAlpha filter) can be implemented using https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ColorMatrixColorFilter and https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/LightingColorFilter\nand https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIColorMatrix etc.. It seems renderscript will almost certainly be the fastest implementation available on android:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/23119957/1925631\nhttps://github.com/patrickfav/Dali/blob/master/dali/src/main/java/at/favre/lib/dali/blur/algorithms/RenderScriptGaussianBlur.java\nhttps://android-developers.googleblog.com/2013/08/renderscript-intrinsics.html\nAnd the implementation seems quite straightforward, along the lines of:\njava\nRenderScript rs = RenderScript.create(theActivity);\nScriptIntrinsicBlur theIntrinsic = ScriptIntrinsicBlur.create(mRS, Element.U8_4(rs));;\nAllocation tmpIn = Allocation.createFromBitmap(rs, inputBitmap);\nAllocation tmpOut = Allocation.createFromBitmap(rs, outputBitmap);\ntheIntrinsic.setRadius(25.f);\ntheIntrinsic.setInput(tmpIn);\ntheIntrinsic.forEach(tmpOut);\ntmpOut.copyTo(outputBitmap);\nCan probably get some inspiration for optimisations from here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-blur/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/cmcewen/blurview/BlurringView.java . And for iOS something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28614430/1925631\n```obj-c\n//  Needs CoreImage.framework\n\n\n(UIImage )blurredImageWithImage:(UIImage )sourceImage{\n//  Create our blurred image\nCIContext context = [CIContext contextWithOptions:nil];\nCIImage inputImage = [CIImage imageWithCGImage:sourceImage.CGImage];\n//  Setting up Gaussian Blur\nCIFilter filter = [CIFilter filterWithName:@\"CIGaussianBlur\"];\n[filter setValue:inputImage forKey:kCIInputImageKey];\n[filter setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:15.0f] forKey:@\"inputRadius\"];\nCIImage result = [filter valueForKey:kCIOutputImageKey];\n/  CIGaussianBlur has a tendency to shrink the image a little, this ensures it matches \n *  up exactly to the bounds of our original image /\nCGImageRef cgImage = [context createCGImage:result fromRect:[inputImage extent]];\nUIImage *retVal = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:cgImage];\nif (cgImage) {\n    CGImageRelease(cgImage);\n}\nreturn retVal;\n}\n```. So, now the boilerplate for the elements and filter attribute would be needed, and of course, the main work of making the filter element create a rendering pipeline according to the svg compositing model: render > filter > clip > mask > blend > composite, so filters need to happen before the current clipping logic.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/compositing/#compositingandblendingorder\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/render.html#Introduction\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html\n\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/render.html#FilteringPaintRegions\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/\nIf the value of the filter property is none then there is no filter effect applied. Otherwise, the list of functions are applied in the order provided.\n<filter-function-list> = [ <filter-function> | <url> ]+\n<filter-function> = <blur()> | <brightness()> | <contrast()> | <drop-shadow()>\n| <grayscale()> | <hue-rotate()> | <invert()> | <opacity()> | <sepia()> | <saturate()>\nThe first filter function or filter reference in the list takes the element (SourceGraphic) as the input image. Subsequent operations take the output from the previous filter function or filter reference as the input image. filter element reference functions can specify an alternate input, but still uses the previous output as its SourceGraphic.\nFilter functions must operate in the sRGB color space.\nA computed value of other than none results in the creation of a stacking context [CSS21] the same way that CSS opacity does. All the elements descendants are rendered together as a group with the filter effect applied to the group as a whole.\nThe filter property has no effect on the geometry of the target element\u2019s CSS boxes, even though filter can cause painting outside of an element\u2019s border box.\nConceptually, any parts of the drawing are effected by filter operations. This includes any content, background, borders, text decoration, outline and visible scrolling mechanism of the element to which the filter is applied, and those of its descendants. The filter operations are applied in the element\u2019s user coordinate system.\nThe compositing model follows the SVG compositing model [SVG11]: first any filter effect is applied, then any clipping, masking and opacity. As per SVG, the application of filter has no effect on hit-testing.. @glthomas Does this help? How much experience do you have with java and objective-c? What parts would you be interested in working on? Perhaps I can give some more specific advice how to get some first steps going.\nE.g. at first, just to get a bit familiar with the code, I would suggest just applying the filter on all the rendered content, either in android or ios, whichever you're more familiar/comfortable with. Or, if you prefer to stick to the javascript part, then perhaps creating the various elements would be a good first step. What do you think?.

Its in my fork here: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/filters?files=1\nYou can just modify the code while it's in node_modules and rebuild the native side.\nAlternatively you can use npm link.. @glthomas Great! It might make sense to rebase onto master of the main repo as well. Actually, fork this repo and make a PR here instead. I only use that one for private testing and preparing my own PRs. . @glthomas Sounds good. I rebased onto master here and pushed to the filters-branch, lets use this one going forwards. Please feel free to ask anything if there's something I might be able to help explain. I've learned obj-c by maintaining this project, didn't have any previous experience with anything apple/mac/ios/obj-c related before that (summer last year). So I have a relatively fresh learning experience of that as well and can probably save you some time.. @glthomas Excellent, seem you're on the right track.\nIt would probably make sense to refactor the masking logic a bit.\nFirst extract a method to render a node to a CIImage: (The first part inside if (self.mask) {}, currently it uses bitmaps, but we need to use CIImage instead to get efficient filters on iOS, as in the blur example earlier: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/150#issuecomment-427582490))\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/1f748205014a52029577dab4de4ce9e320ae2f54/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m#L178-L208\nI think we should extract the luminanceToAlpha from the masking logic into a primitive and rewrite it to use CIImage instead of plain bitmaps: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/1f748205014a52029577dab4de4ce9e320ae2f54/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m#L210-L229\nThen we would just apply the single luminanceToAlpha primitive in the masking logic.\nhttps://gitlab.apertis.org/hmi/webkit-gtk-clutter/blob/06354006dce4769312ab6f863835a48d0433969e/WebCore/kcanvas/device/quartz/KCanvasMaskerQuartz.mm#L41-54\n```obj-c\nstatic CIImage applyLuminanceToAlphaFilter(CIImage inputImage)\n{\n    CIFilter *luminanceToAlpha = [CIFilter filterWithName:@\"CIColorMatrix\"];\n    [luminanceToAlpha setDefaults];\n    CGFloat alpha[4] = {0.2125, 0.7154, 0.0721, 0};\n    CGFloat zero[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n    [luminanceToAlpha setValue:inputImage forKey:@\"inputImage\"];\n    [luminanceToAlpha setValue:[CIVector vectorWithValues:zero count:4] forKey:@\"inputRVector\"];\n    [luminanceToAlpha setValue:[CIVector vectorWithValues:zero count:4] forKey:@\"inputGVector\"];\n    [luminanceToAlpha setValue:[CIVector vectorWithValues:zero count:4] forKey:@\"inputBVector\"];\n    [luminanceToAlpha setValue:[CIVector vectorWithValues:alpha count:4] forKey:@\"inputAVector\"];\n    [luminanceToAlpha setValue:[CIVector vectorWithValues:zero count:4] forKey:@\"inputBiasVector\"];\n    return [luminanceToAlpha valueForKey:@\"outputImage\"];\n}\n```\nSo, another method to apply a filter primitive to a CIImage, (and/or to bitmap as now, if you don't want to rewrite the luminanceToFilter primitive used in the masking logic). This could probably be defined in a common class which all filter primitives would inherit from, something like RNSVGFilterPrimitive.\nThen we should add a method on the RNSVGSvgView, similar to [self.svgView getDefinedMask:self.mask] but getDefinedFilter:self.filter instead \nAnd then a method on RNSVGFilter, to process a CIImage in a pipeline of filter primitives. (any pre-proccesing for this can be done in parseReference, and to define the filter in the svg root view)\nOnce we have at least a single filter primitive, and the rendering into a CIImage, we can change the logic in renderTo such that only if neither self.filter nor self.mask is set, does it use the last branch of the current code, otherwise, it should use the general pipeline, where it makes a CIImage of the render tree (using self instead of RNSVGMask *_maskNode in the [_maskNode renderLayerTo:bcontext rect:rect];, runs the filters on it if needed, does the masking if needed, and renders the result to the current CGContext.. For the feMergeNodes, we should have the parseReference method of the RNSVGFilter to set up a filter graph (map from index/name to filter instance, and the outputs of instances are set as inputs to any others which reference them), such that after setting the source graphic on the first filter primitive and we call createCGImage on the CIImage of the output node, the CIFIlter pipeline handles computing all the needed filters, where the merge nodes do something like this:\nobj-c\nCIFilter *filter = [CIFilter filterWithName:@\"CISourceOverCompositing\"];\n[filter setValue:background forKey:kCIInputBackgroundImageKey];\n[filter setValue:foreground forKey:kCIInputImageKey];\nCIImage *outputImage = [filter outputImage];\nOr, simply:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/ciimage/1437837-imagebycompositingoverimage?l_2\nobj-c\n[foreground imageByCompositingOverImage:background]\nIf I've understood/remember correctly then if we keep it as CIFIlter and CIImage until the actual rendering (createCGImage), it shouldn't process redundant filters in the graph. (i.e., ones which aren't connected to the output node) And it should create less intermediate processing/memory management pressure.. @glthomas Core Image can work on either the cpu or the gpu, in both cases it should be possible to get more efficient than the basic for loop + arithmetic, as it can utilize vector instructions, and do matrix operations very efficiently on the gpu. And in the case of filter chains, it sometimes has the potential to chain several filters together, such that it only needs to process each pixel once. \nI've done an initial refactoring, and built out more of the boilerplate for the filters: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/b33f5575d86cc3d24257dbba4cc31597ac518212\nHopefully this can help you grok more of the logic and how to use CIImage/Filter. At least, applying a single filter on all of the content can be done in the same way as the masking is in the new logic. If you want I could probably build out the filter graph construction, and applying a filter chain if the filter attribute is set i.e., setting the source graphic / rendering the output; and implement e.g. the ColorMatrix filter as an example filter primitive. Then you could perhaps attempt to implement the blur, merge and mergeNode filter primitives?. @glthomas I think I have a rendering pipeline for filters which I'm sufficiently happy with for now at least, the applyFilter method is just the identity function for now, but once I have the filter graph constructed in parseReference, we can just set the inputImage and return the outputImage there.\n```obj-c\nstatic CGImageRef renderToImage(RNSVGRenderable object,\n                                CGSize bounds,\n                                CGRect rect,\n                                CGRect clip)\n{\n    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(bounds, NO, 1.0);\n    CGContextRef cgContext = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n    CGContextTranslateCTM(cgContext, 0.0, bounds.height);\n    CGContextScaleCTM(cgContext, 1.0, -1.0);\n    if (clip) {\n        CGContextClipToRect(cgContext, *clip);\n    }\n    [object renderLayerTo:cgContext rect:rect];\n    CGImageRef contentImage = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(cgContext);\n    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();\n    return contentImage;\n}\n\n\n(CIContext )sharedCIContext {\n    static CIContext sharedCIContext = nil;\n    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;\n    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{\n        sharedCIContext = [[CIContext alloc] init];\n    });\nreturn sharedCIContext;\n}\n\n\n(void)renderTo:(CGContextRef)context rect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    // This needs to be painted on a layer before being composited.\n    CGContextSaveGState(context);\n    CGContextConcatCTM(context, self.matrix);\n    CGContextConcatCTM(context, self.transform);\n    CGContextSetAlpha(context, self.opacity);\n[self beginTransparencyLayer:context];\nif (self.mask || self.filter) {\n    CGRect bounds = CGContextGetClipBoundingBox(context);\n    CGSize boundsSize = bounds.size;\n    CGFloat width = boundsSize.width;\n    CGFloat height = boundsSize.height;\n    CGRect drawBounds = CGRectMake(0, 0, width, height);\n// Render content of current SVG Renderable to image\nCGImageRef currentContent = renderToImage(self, boundsSize, rect, nil);\nCIImage* contentSrcImage = [CIImage imageWithCGImage:currentContent];\n\nif (self.filter) {\n    // https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html\n    RNSVGFilter *_filterNode = (RNSVGFilter*)[self.svgView getDefinedFilter:self.filter];\n    contentSrcImage = [_filterNode applyFilter:contentSrcImage];\n}\n\nif (self.mask) {\n    // https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/masking.html#MaskElement\n    RNSVGMask *_maskNode = (RNSVGMask*)[self.svgView getDefinedMask:self.mask];\n    CGFloat x = [self relativeOn:[_maskNode x] relative:width];\n    CGFloat y = [self relativeOn:[_maskNode y] relative:height];\n    CGFloat w = [self relativeOn:[_maskNode width] relative:width];\n    CGFloat h = [self relativeOn:[_maskNode height] relative:height];\n\n    // Clip to mask bounds and render the mask\n    CGRect maskBounds = CGRectMake(x, y, w, h);\n    CGImageRef maskContent = renderToImage(_maskNode, boundsSize, rect, &maskBounds);\n    CIImage* maskSrcImage = [CIImage imageWithCGImage:maskContent];\n\n    // Apply luminanceToAlpha filter primitive\n    // https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html#feColorMatrixElement\n    CIImage *alphaMask = transformImageIntoAlphaMask(maskSrcImage);\n    CIImage* composite = applyBlendWithAlphaMask(contentSrcImage, alphaMask);\n\n    // Create masked image and release memory\n    CGImageRef compositeImage = [[RNSVGRenderable sharedCIContext] createCGImage:composite fromRect:drawBounds];\n\n    // Render composited result into current render context\n    CGContextDrawImage(context, drawBounds, compositeImage);\n    CGImageRelease(compositeImage);\n    CGImageRelease(maskContent);\n} else {\n    // Render filtered result into current render context\n    CGImageRef filteredImage = [[RNSVGRenderable sharedCIContext] createCGImage:contentSrcImage fromRect:drawBounds];\n    CGContextDrawImage(context, drawBounds, filteredImage);\n    CGImageRelease(filteredImage);\n}\n\nCGImageRelease(currentContent);\n\n} else {\n    [self renderLayerTo:context rect:rect];\n}\n[self endTransparencyLayer:context];\nCGContextRestoreGState(context);\n}\n```. @glthomas  Hmm, well it seems to work fine as is for me. I haven't tested the filters yet, but the masking works just fine. XCode doesn't complain when I build it, and it doesn't crash when I run, so I guess what we have  already covers whatever is needed.\nI'm getting close to having a functional pipeline for filters:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/c30fd3d7a02119e193c80edc6cfa37fe6d85133c/ios/Filters/RNSVGFilter.m#L24-L44\n\n\nAnd ColorMatrix:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/c30fd3d7a02119e193c80edc6cfa37fe6d85133c/ios/Filters/RNSVGFEColorMatrix.m#L13-L40\nIt doesn't have any optimizations or caching yet. But easier to get the core infrastructure working first before doing that.. @glthomas Sure, can do that. I have the ColorMatrix example from the spec mostly working now:\njsx\nconst ExampleFEColorMatrix = props => (\n    <Svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 500\" {...props}>\n        <Defs>\n

I get the feeling that he's been very busy the past year or so, can't remember if he has replied in any react-native-svg issues this year, or replied to any questions I've posed since I got rights to maintain the project. So I think he probably has too much other stuff going on to give much attention to these things.\nAnyways, he did a great job getting most of svg working in react-native and I'm thankful for that. But we should probably move the example inside the repo and exclude it from npm, or, make a new one under react-native-community ( @dustinsavery do you have the rights for this? ). Or otherwise, I can make something under my own name and try to keep it up to date. And then it can be forked again once maintenance passes on to the ones who volunteer / are compensated to do the work. Could perhaps have a showcase part of the readme with links to nice examples / articles / tutorials etc to give more ideas and boilerplate for people to get started faster.. Thanks! Well, should probably implement it for android as well before merging, otherwise there will be redundant questions. You can already use it for iOS by depending on a specific commit or this branch. Publishing to npm doesn't really change anything, as there's no compile step involved with publishing, it just copies a subset of the files to npm and tags it with a version number. Commits are at least referenced by a hash of the content and are in that sense actually safer. . @folofse Great work!\nThat can probably be used for relatively many cases as a workaround for now, by splitting svg content into background, blurred/shaded parts, and foreground.. I think this should be fixed in the latest versions, @julienfouilhe can you double check?. It now supports the transform attributes and is much more spec conformant. But there are lots of features in the spec, with varying support in the ever-green browsers, but missing from react-native-svg still. PRs very welcome \ud83d\ude04 . @chengyin I think I've fixed the underlying issue now, try with the latest commit in the master branch and this code:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  View,\n  TouchableWithoutFeedback,\n} from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Rect, Text as SvgText } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class touchesMove extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\nthis.state = { event: 'Last press event will be shown here.' };\nthis.handlers = {\n  onPress: () => {\n    this.setEvent('onPress');\n  },\n  onPressIn: () => {\n    this.setEvent('onPressIn');\n  },\n  onPressOut: () => {\n    this.setEvent('onPressOut');\n  },\n};\n\n}\nsetEvent(event) {\n    this.setState({ event });\n  }\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n            {'react-native-svg '}\n          \n\n\n\n{'react-native '}\n\n\n{this.state.event}\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: 'white',\n  },\n  demo: {\n    width: 200,\n    height: 200,\n    backgroundColor: 'orange',\n  },\n  text: { color: 'white' },\n});\n```. @jnicholls Oh, I wonder if I've introduced a regression after having fixed this, could you try with this commit (the latest one when I wrote the previous comment) https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/ad99f97c84126ad1a66b5718d98f2adfaf3beb16\nOr if that still fails, then the parent commit to that one: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/35597ed7720ef01abe1c111e22308468e605cf01. @jnicholls I have a fix for android: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/e2e415c467be71bc1555f81228fac0bb9a66842c \nIt also adds support for the react-native inspector, so you can check the fill bounds of svg elements.. Can you try this fix? (for iOS) https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a\n. I think I have (gesture) interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. I think this should be fixed now, closing until further notice.. Yeah, seems to work fine. Will close for now.. This is probably an outdated issue, for reference check e.g. https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest. Could you try again with the latest commit in the master branch? I've fixed several related issues and might have fixed this at the same time.. I think I have (gesture) interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. I think this should be fixed now, closing until further notice.. @vadermemo Are you able to reproduce this issue with the latest version? E.g. inside this project: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-e2e\nI don't have access to any iPhone, so it's a bit hard for me to test this in any way, and therefore quite hard to fix in case there are issues remaining. But, at least if you can make a reproducible demo e.g. fork the e2e test repo, then we should certainly reopen this.. This has probably been caused by incompatible versions. Closing for now.. Example has been updated, closing for now.. Work on filters tracked here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/150. Its fully possible, just have to integrate with the driver and the declarative animation passing ;) You wanna take a shot at it?. @joshuapinter For the native props you can check the view managers https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/master/ios/ViewManagers. @zachgibson I don't really know. But, I think somehow on the native side we need to allow animated values as props, and then register onchange listeners to actually set the values on the shadow nodes and invalidate up the tree to queue a re-rendering of the bitmap. It might be a really minor change, just have to figure out  how to glue the listener and the animated/shadow nodes. @vjeux Could you mentor here a bit, would be much appreciated!. Alright, no probs. I managed to animate opacity of a Svg Rect with the native driver in iOS, by removing this one method \ud83d\ude03 https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/152e839126e66a708a9492d203ef7fb4302e1030/ios/ViewManagers/RNSVGNodeManager.m#L27-L30. Yeah I was having some issues with animating the props represented as NSString, haven't figured out how to deal with that yet. But  CGFloat based ones seem to work with just removing that one method to get the shadow nodes registered, trying to figure out how to get it to skip the YGValue conversion now.. I think any property name collisions with RCTShadowView need to be pre-fixed with rnsvg or something similar. Or now that I think about it, the removed method probably needs to exist, and give a shadow node corresponding to the element.. Most of the properties are strings, because they support units and they depend on e.g. the font-size and clip bounds so need to be passed as such to the native side for the css resolution logic. E.g. Rect has a name collision for width and height with RCTShadowView causing it to use the YGValue converter.. I've managed to hack together a proof of concept for android as well, but I'm really hoping it's the wrong approach and that there is some better way of getting it to work, using this approach it would have to create a View/ViewGroup for each node, at least it doesn't have to be attached to the layout tree, but its silly to have it, when all I use it for is to get the id / shadow node corresponding to it. Also the queueing of the rendering might not be as efficient as it should be. Any feedback would be much appreciated! https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/fbd65912512aa74c00d13d32a26c1f7b3e538b46 (Edit force-pushed some missing files). @joshyhargreaves I have a PR to react-native for string interpolation on iOS now \ud83d\ude04https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/18187 Waiting for some feedback, and if good will port it to Android as well. Allowing us to animate all of the string props with unit support. Added the missing ReactProps to Android as well https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/a3c9aa287257eb6ef8a6853dded0a490b0b1830c\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nfunction getInitialState() {\n  const anim = new Animated.Value(0);\n  const fillOpacity = anim.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [0, 1],\n  });\n  const offset = fillOpacity.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [0, 10],\n  });\n  const strokeOpacity = offset.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 5],\n    outputRange: [0, 1],\n    extrapolateRight: 'clamp',\n  });\n  const strokeWidth = strokeOpacity.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: ['0', '5'],\n  });\n  return { anim, fillOpacity, offset, strokeOpacity, strokeWidth };\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = getInitialState();\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    const { anim } = this.state;\n    Animated.timing(anim, {\n      toValue: 1,\n      duration: 3000,\n      useNativeDriver: true,\n    }).start();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const { fillOpacity, offset, strokeOpacity, strokeWidth } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. Now with android support for native string interpolation as well: https://github.com/msand/react-native/commit/d3d6e669fcf5e53c7b8c8cb33dbe8e81f587cef3. v7.0.0 has been released with support for useNativeDriver. @designingSparks You probably need to use setNativeProps with a matrix for the transform for now, you might want to ask @msageryd. @oriharel For animation of the Path d attribute check here: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/18187#issuecomment-414157937\nAlthough, be aware that the path parsing on android is quite inefficient at the moment, and one of the biggest consumers of cpu when animating the path data. At least from what I could see when profiling that example in android studio. . I've mostly tested using 0.56 and 0.57, but as long as it builds and runs without exceptions you should be fine. If you have any issues with any recent version then please report it.. I've implemented support for animation of transform styles using the same syntax as for react-native views now (with and without useNativeDriver): fb4e877\nand the same for x and y on Text and TSpan https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/803#issuecomment-428785429jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Dimensions, Animated } from \"react-native\";\nimport Svg, { Text, TSpan, G } from \"react-native-svg\";\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nconst AnimatedG = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(G);\nclass NativeAnimGTransform extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    anim: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.animate(this.props.value);\n  }\ncomponentDidUpdate({ value }) {\n    this.animate(value);\n  }\nanimate = value =>\n    Animated.timing(this.state.anim, {\n      useNativeDriver: true,\n      duration: 4000,\n      toValue: value,\n    }).start();\nrender() {\n    const { anim } = this.state;\nreturn (\n  <Svg width={width} height={height}>\n    <AnimatedG\n      style={{\n        transform: [\n          {\n            translateY: anim.interpolate({\n              inputRange: [0, 1],\n              outputRange: [0, 100],\n            }),\n          },\n        ],\n      }}\n    >\n      <Text>\n        <TSpan>Test</TSpan>\n      </Text>\n    </AnimatedG>\n  </Svg>\n);\n\n}\n}\nexport default function App() {\n  return ;\n}\n. Now with useNativeDriver animation support for all number accepting properties (without need for my fork of react-native, works at least in 0.57 straight away): https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/864d7610d3aaea2b4e4f722f04ea52ddf292aae7. @oriharel I just tried running `react-native init oldVersion --version v0.50.4` upgraded sdk, gradle / build tools versions, and then `yarn add react-native-svg` resulting in:\n        \"react\": \"16.0.0\",\n        \"react-native\": \"0.50.4\",\n        \"react-native-svg\": \"^7.1.2\",\n```\nAnd it seemed to work fine even with useNativeDriver: true\nSo it still seems be compatible with the versions given in the readme at least. I've implemented the SVGLength interface now, and optimised the code for the case when the arguments are numbers rather than strings. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/SVGLength\nIn properties where the spec allows for SVGLengthList it now accepts single values as either number or string, and arrays of values which can even be mixed, as long as each value can be interpreted as a SVGLength. So, if want to optimise your code, you should pass all unit-less lengths/dimensions as Number instead of String, and preferably author your svg content without using units, instead rely on the viewbox attribute together with the width and height. This eliminates representing numbers as strings, which is inefficient. And, thanks to these changes, the animations do not cause a redundant double > string > double round-trip.. @oriharel I would expect that one to work, it's probably a bug in the implementation of checkPattern, it should just make sure that there is exactly the same number of substrings which can be interpreted as independent numbers in all strings, such that it can actually produce a string with a number in each place where it is needed.\nIt is also possible to animate between arbitrary paths in general, but there are more ways than one to do it, so it requires deciding more boundary conditions / dynamics to enable linear interpolation. And that's something which tends to need experimentation and tailor made curves/algorithms to actually looks nice, so it doesn't belong in a simple linear interpolator. \nBut, at least the batman example should certainly be possible to animate using the js logic in plain react-native, and using the native driver in my fork. Or, now that I think about it, I remember vaguely that the plain react-native limits string interpolation to color strings, and the code you removed just removes that redundant restriction. I'll have to check and test a bit once I have a bit more time for this.. Closing this now as everything should be working correctly afaik.. Closing this until someone comes up with an idea how to implement.. You can try my fork, it has support for custom fonts on Android, and various other fixes.\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/TextOnAPathLayoutRulesConformance\nYou can see how to set a font in here: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/commit/3b47667fbca150857297880cb7ae27728de5fc0f\nJust remember to use the exact PostScript name of the font you want to use, the syntax might be different from ios. If Kingsmen doesn't work, then try \"Kingsmen Regular\" and \"Kingsmen-Regular\", if this still doesn't help, then try renaming the file to Kingsmen-Regular.otf . @StribMaxMarti This pull request now contains almost all the fixes from android ported to ios as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430\nnpm i -s react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#13d5157. @macrozone  Once it's merged into master, published on npm, and Expo makes a new version of their fork of RN + other deps, then all my fixes will be available from there as well. I don't know if they support custom fonts at the moment, but at least in theory it's fully possible.. @darkrift Its available since v6.0.0 and up, should work fine. Expo hasn't updated yet though.. @darkrift  I would expect a sizeable fraction, if not the majority, of issues are close-able. Or not even actual issues with the library at all, but rather lack of knowledge of the svg spec, react-native and the react life-cycle. I just haven't put any time into closing old issues. I've mostly fixed things I need for work, some of my own itches and any issues others have which would bite myself sooner or later anyway, and the rest just for fun and learning :) At least I have custom fonts working in production with the latest versions, so I'll go ahead and close this for now. . @finnfiddle I haven't looked into it at least, and haven't had any need for it. Honestly I didn't even know it existed or seen it in use anywhere yet. Would you be interested in working on it?. I would recommend reading the spec for paint servers at the very least https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/pservers.html and then look at how e.g. gradients and symbols have been implemented, there will be quite a lot of similarities. Essentially a new element will need to be defined, so a react component and the attribute handling in js, and a shadow node / view implementation in objective-c and java, and a bit of view manager logic to glue them together. \nThe Pattern specific part just needs the repetition of the pre defined pattern according to the language in the spec. That seems very straight forward at least, a double loop on the visible part of the canvas, and clipping using either the fill or stroke of the graphics element which references the pattern should suffice: \n\n14.4. Patterns\nA pattern is used to fill or stroke an object using a pre-defined graphic object which can be replicated (\"tiled\") at fixed intervals in x and y to cover the areas to be painted. Patterns are defined using a \u2018pattern\u2019 element and then referenced by properties fill and stroke on a given graphics element to indicate that the given element shall be filled or stroked with the pattern.\nAttributes \u2018x\u2019, \u2018y\u2019, \u2018width\u2019, \u2018height\u2019 and \u2018patternUnits\u2019 define a reference rectangle somewhere on the infinite canvas. The reference rectangle has its top/left at (x, y) and its bottom/right at (x + width, y + height). The tiling theoretically extends a series of such rectangles to infinity in X and Y (positive and negative), with rectangles starting at (x + mwidth, y + n height) for each possible integer value for m and n.\n\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/pservers.html#Patterns. But yeah, the pattern element seems really useful, and I can probably help out more, just ask and I'll give clues or help with the boilerplate. I'll probably be shifting projects from working full time + building a company, to just building a company in the end of the month, and won't have any RN project as main focus for some time. So I'm not sure how it'll affect my contributions, the startup will be my main focus, but shifting from two jobs to one might give me more time for open source as well. Lets see how things go \ud83d\ude03 . @questionablequestion @finnfiddle I've implemented basic support for patterns here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/fc63635f3cb6c03de22fb8c7eb973b08e0147b1b\nAny help in testing is much appreciated!. Closing this as Pattern is implemented now.. Seems line a jest configuration issue rather than svg rendering issue. Closing.. LinearGradient works to some extent now, gradientTransform is still missing. Is anyone working on this? Or does anyone know what it would entail?. I've made an implementation that works in Android now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/357. @iKettles not sure if you got any update from the previous comment, as you only liked my first comment, and you don't show up as an participant... Thought you might want to try my solution out ;). I've added support for Image transform as well now. In our case we now have support for everything we need, i.e., Illustrator svg output cross-platform rendering support (web compatiblity using https://github.com/godaddy/svgs ). (Still only tested in web and android). I've made a gist with some instructions and code for converting Illustrator output into svgs / react-native-svg compatible form: https://gist.github.com/msand/4b37d3ce04246f83cb28fdbfe4716ecc. Could you try again with the new correct transform parser and the spec conformant syntax? I think this should be working correctly already.. @almirfilho @masonk @betko I've implemented it in Android, and possibly in iOS as well, needs more testing, can you try my fork? \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#5a01d67\nyarn add react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#5a01d67. @nico1510 I'm not sure what version they have in Expo right now, it might not have those commits yet. I'll try to get a new release done this week. You can see an example here: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-example/blob/SpecTests/src/components/baseline.js. http://bl.ocks.org/eweitnauer/7325338. I'll be closing this as it works in react-native-svg. Expo needs an update still.. @getnashty @garbo-a @AlbertBrand This should be working correctly in the latest version :). None as of yet. Feel free to work on it if interested.. I think I've fixed the issues with onPress/in/Out now, can you try with the latest commit from the master branch?. I think I have (gesture) interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. Closing as the original issues seems fixed.. @xutm Seems you've upgraded react without running pod install or pod update. \nThe other problems in this issue are probably version incompatibilities between react-native and react-native-svg, check the compatibility table in the readme. Otherwise reopen.. Can you post a full reproduction as a git repo?. You seem to be running quite an old version. Performancebezier and quartzbookpack haven't been included for quite some time. But thanks for the info anyway! . @Aurelyn10 Yes I was replying to you, as I looked at your screenshot and noticed the old dependencies. The latest version of react-native-svg is v7.1.2\nIf you want to stay on version 6 I would still recommend running at least v6.5.2\nLots of bugs have been fixed since v6.3.1 and the Performancebezier and quartzbookpack dependencies (which you currently have in use) have been removed.. I would recommend upgrading to the latest version of both react-native and react-native-svg. @josephbuchma Try cleaning the native builds and your packager cache. Delete node_modules. Then yarn or npm install. Rebuild your native projects and run again.. And, the classic, try turning your computer off and on again ;). Or, what error messages can you see?. @magicismight Hey! Great work on react-native-svg! Do you know what might be the issue here? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/362\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1131362/27012951-efe3a9ae-4ee2-11e7-8ab2-a70521f47183.png. I've made a minimal repro in: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug. @magicismight I've made significantly improved support for various attributes of text, tspan and textpath in https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/TextOnAPathLayoutRulesConformance\nAs mentioned there are some test cases in https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug\nIt is now possible to get pixel perfect results when comparing chrome and react-native-svg on android, but it requires scaling some of the values for the native rendering, and I'm not sure what this depends on yet. Would you have any suggestions or insights into this? You can see examples of the different values for web / native in the src/components folder, especially the toap and request .js files.. I've also implemented a debug / diagnostics mode, using canvas.drawTextOnPath\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/4fea95398e392e644b077adaacc07254f731dd9b/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L124-L126\nWhich you can set here:\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/4fea95398e392e644b077adaacc07254f731dd9b/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L37. This looks like the linking process has failed. Try linking manually.. This library isn't meant for reading .svg files, but for creating react components which render svg. There are other libraries which read svg files and render them using this library.. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/12. Docs have been updated: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#use-with-svg-files\nWith react-native-svg-transformer you can now do this:\njsx\nimport Logo from \"./logo.svg\";\nconst MyApp = () => <Logo width={120} height={40} />\nexport default MyApp. This is probably because of a change in the api between javascript and native. If the api of the bridge communication changes, you need to make a new native build instead of only code-push the new javascript.. @marzolfb @ElieMyIdea Have you tried this? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430. @ElieMyIdea  Are you unable to upgrade RN? If you're able to get up to at least \n    \"peerDependencies\": {\n        \"prop-types\": \"^15.5.10\",\n        \"react\": \">=15.4.0\",\n        \"react-native\": \">=0.40.0\"\n    },\nthen you can use my \"version\": \"5.1.7.3\" from\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/5.1.7.1\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/5.1.7.1/package.json\nby running one of:\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#2181798\nyarn add react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#2181798  \nIf you can get up to \n    \"peerDependencies\": {\n        \"react-native\": \">=0.46.0\",\n        \"react\": \"16.0.0-alpha.12\",\n        \"prop-types\": \"^15.5.8\"\n    },\nThen use my 5.4.1 or 6.0.0 by running one of:\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#5a01d67\nyarn add react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#5a01d67. otherwise, if you get it to a version below 0.46 but not compatible with 5.1.7.3, then use 5.2.0 or 5.3.0 from my fork. @dwilt have you tried react-native-svg@6.0.0-rc1 ? The changes are merged into the 6.0.0 branch https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/6.0.0. Interesting, could you try to find some value which is set / calculated to the string '1' and change it to the number {1} instead?. Can you try cleaning your project in xcode, \nshut down any react bundler\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm i\nreact-native run-ios. The latest commit in the 6.0.0 branch doesn't work with yarn, only with npm, because of a git submodule dependency which yarn doesn't install, try removing node_modules and install using npm instead of yarn. Otherwise, try to react-native init newproject and install react-native-svg@6.0.0-rc1 there. Or try cloning and testing using this https://github.com/msand/newproject/. @dwilt what version of react-native is that? is it a 0.50-rc? can you try this:\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#ec35a1e. Did you try running \ngit clone https://github.com/msand/newproject/\ncd newproject\nnpm i\nnpm run start\nnpm run next\n?\n(next runs the web version of the universal setup). I'm wondering, did you run react-native link after installing react-native-svg?. Otherwise, verify that libRNSVG.a is in the list of linked libraries in the xcode project. And, as you already got the newproject building and starting, you can test your use case there at least..  Can you try with this instead (should also work with yarn):\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#5a01d67. Try with the latest commit from the 6.0.0 branch:\nnpm i -S react-native-svg@https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg.git#6.0.0\nor\nnpm i -S react-native-svg@https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg.git#be8797b\nAs I have in my fork of the git submodule example repo:\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-example/blob/6.0.0/package.json. At some point I had a similar issue, but can't remember specific reason, either changing commit or clearing packager cache, or cleaning the native build. I think some old code was used by xcode or the ios js side at least, can remember which one. Do you have the same issue in android?. Might have to restart xcode after installing using npm as well, the project might not be correctly loaded otherwise.. @boygirl It seems you might be mixing up the rotate attribute on text elements (per glyph list of rotation angles) https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#TSpanElementRotateAttribute\nand the transform attribute (a list of transform definitions) https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute\ntry changing to something like:\n<Text {...props} transform={transform}>\n  <TSpan {...moreProps}>\n    {content}\n  </TSpan>\n</Text>. @boygirl You probably want a text/tspan element per label, rotate them while in the correct position relative to the origin, and then translate them into the correct positions / set their final origin.. @boygirl https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform. @boygirl At least in my tests it seems to be spec conformant, can you try making the same in a jsfiddle, git repo, Expo or something? https://jsfiddle.net/m126Lrqu/\nIn my RNSvgTests I have three examples of rotation:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTests/blob/master/src/components/Nested.js\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTests/blob/master/src/components/baseline.js\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTests/blob/master/src/components/RotateScale.js\nThey're implemented as cross-platform svg, using the svgs library, (server-side) rendering using next.js for the web and react-native for ios and android. So it's easy to ensure that the same svg structure and attribute values create the expected output in the evergreens.. Ah, I think the optional parameters for rotate aren't supported yet, so you will have to use this manual pattern replacement rotate(a x y) = translate(x, y) rotate(a) translate(-x, -y). And I think support for several instances of one type of transform definition in one transform attribute value string might be sketchy as well, so best to put that in three different nested elements / transform attribute. Or simply implement support for it in the javascript transform parser: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/lib/extract/extractTransform.js\nAlternatively, set x and y for the labels to 0, rotate them while at the origin using a transform rotate, and use a wrapping G element with a transform translate to put it into place.. The TransformParser needs to be rewritten https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/lib/extract/extractTransform.js#L18-L63\nIt should split the string per definition, reduce over them with an initial value of the identity matrix, and for each transform definition, multiply the accumulated matrix with a matrix corresponding to the transform, and warn if any definitions cannot be parsed.. At least the images correspond to rotate without the optional parameters, so, rotating about the (centered) origin 0, 45 and 90 degrees.. Is this the effect you're looking for?\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/onm20qp2/1/. Same with one transform definition per element: https://jsfiddle.net/onm20qp2/2/. Great! Happy I could help. nested & combined transforms can be a bit tricky at first, but, once you think of them as affine transforms in 3d using matrices and what order they're multiplied, it suddenly becomes almost trivial. Just have to get the order right ;). @boygirl I've made a pull request with a new transform parser, could you try it out, I haven't tested it properly yet. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/507. Seems unrelated/old.. \u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\u3002 \u6682\u65f6\u5173\u95ed\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002. No support for shape-rendering as of yet.. Try increasing the size of your viewBox perhaps? Do you want sharper/crisper edges or faster rendering? Can you post a reproduction showing issues?. React-Native doesn't have css, or selectors, so you can't query for subsets of the dom that way. Use d3.js for transformation of data and calculating shapes, path data etc. And then render using the declarative React approach.. Please provide a full replication if you want progress on this.. @pehlert Hmm, I can't really figure anything out from that stacktrace, as it doesn't even mention any code from this library. Could try to make a reproducible scenario?. This might be of interest to you: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/848#issuecomment-445501856. @ankha0109 Seems it's mostly fixed by wrapping any parts where you have both static children and some dynamic number of children in the same component. Try wrapping the dynamic part in a G element. I'm not sure if this is a bug in react, react-native or this library yet. If you can provide a small reproduction that would be great!. I suspect this might be a bug in react-native. What versions are you using @wmonecke can you paste the output from running react-native info here?. Or possibly, colliding / the same key on several children within a single parent, might be the cause as well.. @vishalTechnoFreek can you also provide the output from react-native info?. @pehlert  @rogueturnip (or anyone else) Do you have a set of versions and an example where this reliably doesn't happen but does happen reliably with some other set of versions? Would be great to have a bit more to go on to isolate this.. I've isolated this to between v6.5.2 and v7.0.0 with the code in https://snack.expo.io/@msand/groaning-chocolate\nhttps://github.com/msand/ReproRCTUIManagerBug. I've isolated it to the removal of this method returning null for the shadowView: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/257a98cecba4f5594f9d29b996c14902a3a02d37\nMerged just before releasing v7\nThis change allows using native animation of the opacity, but I'm not sure if it's actually needed for animating other things, and opacity might be possible to animate with the same logic as for the other properties now.. The merged PR can be found here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/755. I've opened an issue over at the react-native repo, perhaps someone there has deeper insight into this. https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23350. Published v9.2.4 with a fix. Can you please test it?. React-Native doesn't support css or selectors. This can be done by parsing the xml and css, applying all the selectors and rules, and inlining the resulting attribute values, e.g. in the browser or node.js at compile time.. The gist includes css style and js script tags. I wouldn't expect it to work in RN. You can inline the css and limit yourself to the supported components. Then it should work.. I think I've fixed the issue. Can you try with the latest commit from the master branch?. Closing because of inactivity.. You can also use https://github.com/godaddy/svgs instead, svgs is a compatiblity layer between svg and react-native-svg. @timscott Great, thanks :) You can check out https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug if you wanna see an example of how to combine https://github.com/zeit/next.js for the web part and react-native for mobile using a single codebase ;). @temphiza @ajonno @timperkins @raduflp @catharp @smothers @ma-pe @berpcor  @pruthvip @3rd-Eden @maxkomarychev @magicismight  I've implemented basic support for the Mask element here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/46307ecd2d2eb6849c0cb2465106201cb9901dda\nAny help in testing is much appreciated! There might be some color space / gamma correction issue or something with iOS making the luminance to alpha calculation behave strange, haven't tested on any real devices yet.\nyarn add react-native-svg@msand/react-native-svg#46307ec. Found the issue in iOS, now it should work quite alright.\nyarn add react-native-svg@msand/react-native-svg#b88cba8. @smothers You're actually relying on buggy behaviour in your clip path workaround. You should have it as a single path element to use the fill-rule as you're now. I've made it spec conformant in my current work branch so that will be breaking when it gets released.. @smothers When building something with react-native-svg, I would recommend making sure your implementation works in the ever-green browsers as well (using e.g. the svgs library or plain svg files). If not, then it is likely to break once react-native-svg catches up with the standard.. v7.0.0 released. @Titozzz I think it might be because of no x,y,width,height attributes on the mask element, can you try adding something like this: \njsx\n      <Mask\n        id=\"Mask\"\n        maskUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"\n        x=\"0\"\n        y=\"0\"\n        width=\"800\"\n        height=\"300\"\n      >\nAnd perhaps move the Mask element inside the Defs element.. Yes, it doesn't have enough information to know what causes it. You error message gives more relevant info: \n                         E  java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"undefined\"\n                         E      at java.lang.FloatingDecimal.readJavaFormatString(FloatingDecimal.java:1306)\n                         E      at java.lang.Double.valueOf(Double.java:511). Does it work correctly when you set x, y, w, h? I'm not sure what the defaults should be. Will need to read the spec more and test in some browsers. Might have time for it in the weekend in the best case. . @jackmew Can you try adding the x, y, width and height attributes to the Mask element? It needs to be specified explicitly for now it seems.. @jackmew Open a new issue including a complete reproduction if you want progress on that issue. Will close this now as basic mask element support exists.. Closing this.. Wonderful, thanks a lot for this, haven't had time to investigate this. Looking forward to your PR \ud83d\udc4d . Released a new version, please help with testing to see if there are any remaining leaks!. Closing this as the issue seems to be fixed.. @dwilt Have you tried to run e.g. https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg-example or https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest if you want cocoapods?. True, was thinking it might be good to eliminate some variables, by trying to build and run and known to work repo. Cocoapods is only needed if you want that to handle configuring your native dependencies for your xcode project, e.g. if you want fbsdk installed in a CI compatible way etc.. Either that, or you can checkout a few commits earlier: https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/commit/4e36ccd24de0f23d8cffd8fce0b0c640048d47cc\nBefore the cocoapods integration.. Or, just do the steps I did:\nreact-native init SVGTest \ncd SVGTest\nyarn add react-native-svg\nreact-native link react-native-svg\nRemove libRNSVG-tvOS.a manually using xcode.\nBuild and run.. This should work if following the linking instructions. Closing for now.. I've fixed the transform handling for ClipPath on Android, and the spec conformance on both iOS and Android. Any help in testing would be much appreciated! https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/a1097b85942c559ebcef6b93fa2ce601434d9c50. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. There are other libraries available for this. Closing.. I tried to keep tags in git in sync with npm versions now. Should be slightly clearer. Also making some release notes in here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/releases. @n1ru4l Yeah.  Well, I'm just doing this for fun on my freetime and am building a company more than full time. While choosing between building functionality, fixing issues and writing release notes I've put lower priority on notes, as the commit log is there to read. Please feel free to summarize it and I'll post release notes. Or would you prefer an empty but up to date release log? . @n1ru4l v7.0.0 and release notes available for the past versions.. @neiker The commit messages have summaries of the changes, haven't had time to write release notes yet. What kind of issues do you have? Any description/replication?. Insufficient info, closing.... Could you try this with the latest version? I think it might be fixed. Can this be closed?. Closing because of no response.. @sonaye I'm considering a rewrite in c++ or rust because of the fabric rewrite of react native, check here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/878\nThis would simplify cross-platform efforts significantly. Support has been published.. Can you try with the latest version or my PR https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596\nViewbox is definitely working at least.. Seems like an old issue, closing.... In the latest versions this should be working in a spec conformant way in both android and ios. Please re-open if not.. @lschmierer Is this still in issue with the latest version?. @LRNZ09 Can you try with the latest v7? Or even better, this branch: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/SVGLength. v8 has been released, this issue has likely been fixed in https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/763 which is available since v7 up.. Please try with the latest version, or provide a full replication. Closing until then.. Not sure what you mean here. You can use e.g. d3.js to transform some data about a set of individuals and their ancestry to some geometric data, then visualize that using svg. Very much depends on the data and the visualization wanted. I'll go ahead and close this as it probably fits better in e.g. the stackoverflow format.. Are you still having this issue? If you are, then it's probably the path parser in the native code part.. Fixed in #704 . You either need to use a font with built in glyphs for unicode emojis, or then you can simply use normal svg, look at e.g. react-native-vector-icons . @sertony Can you try this? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/746. @sertony Can you try\nyarn add react-native-svg@msand/react-native-svg#e613efa\nor\nnpm i react-native-svg@msand/react-native-svg#e613efa. Closing because of inactivity.. Sounds strange. Closing until replication / demonstration of expected behavior using other svg renderers available.. At least I'm able to use v25 just fine in both dev and prod builds. Have you tried opening the android project in android studio and install v25? . How is it an issue? Or a requirement? More like an outdated suggestion from their part. E.g. react-native-fbsdk use SDK 26 and appcompat-v7:27.0.2\nAt least I consider google more relevant than facebook regarding what versions of native code to use when building for android.. That's true. But at least I've been running (all?) the newer version without issues, as long as the appcompat matches.. I've made a PR to react-native and the docs. So now you have a source telling you to upgrade, to address a Path Traversal Vulnerability.\nhttps://deploy-preview-156--react-native.netlify.com/docs/next/getting-started.html#android-development-environment\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/581#issuecomment-360675798\n\nlepouya commented 8 hours ago\n@msand\u00a0It's the same versions as why facebook-android-sdk uses\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/17752\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/17747\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/156. @hrm123 @nol13 @Maxwell2022 I've released a new version, which aligns with react-native init, to make it as easy as possible for newcomers. Anyone with needs to upgrade any versions to anything different from that, will hopefully learn how to change them in their dependencies in the process as well. Lets see if they upgrade any versions, now that a PR exists. Can release a new version to align with that when they do.. It seems facebook themselves are running appcompat 27.0.2 internally, which i guesss means they compile against SDK 27. I think manually updating these versions to the latest ones, is the way to go, for anyone who wants to use the latest patches for security, performance etc. Using outdated versions because some more than one year old documentation suggests so, probably shouldn't be best practice. Especially when up to date sources explicitly say to use the latest available. Keeping it maximally convenient for beginners makes sense as well, thus having react-native init use the latest ones is what should actually change.. @Billy-  Interesting, they should be aligned with react-native in the latest version. Can you provide your android/app/build.gradle file? The appcompat dependency has been removed as well, so it should build with almost any combination now.. I have an open PR fixing this now https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596. This seems to work fine now.. Proptypes have been removed as the RN codebase is doing the same.. Closing this for now. PRs welcome.. @foyarash @marcioadr88 @ljunb @dustinsavery I have a PR with support for this now, can you test it and see if it behaves as you expect?\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596. @sibelius Check here https://snack.expo.io/@msand/image-from-uri-inside-svg. @ricklancee Oh, I didn't try in plain RN or iOS, just a Snack and Android. Having a filecache certainly seems like a great idea! Thanks for the example!. RN 0.54 now has Blob support and Expo will probably get in the next version later this month https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/123\nIf you're trying this on expo, it won't work because it's a native dependency and requires linking. . You can use stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to achieve this.. Render the image, draw on top, call toDataURL.. I've added support for Image transform as well now.. Just placing images and using normal transforms should suffice for this.. \n. \n. @ssssssssssss Actually, my fork is based on your fork for gradientTransforms, I've made them work in java already, still some work in obj-c. It also had some of the code from your text fork, but that seems to have caused the moving in y direction of the text in the toap01.svg example, and did nothing to the textpath around the circle, it is still inside the path when it should be outside.\nAt least, taking the extractText logic from the master branch / 5.1.8 version; moves the text on native closer to where it should be in the toap example. But it is still a bit off, compared to the reference from rendering the web version on chrome.\n\n. Also, it seems the the dx and dy values translate relative to the viewport instead of relative to the textpath.. \n. I've added the rest of the examples from https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html now as well, such that there is more to test with.. I wonder, why aren't the android.graphics.Canvas.drawText(char[] text, int index, int count, float x, float y, Paint paint) and android.graphics.Canvas.drawTextOnPath(char[] text, int index, int count, Path path, float hOffset, float vOffset, Paint paint) methods utilized?\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#drawText(char%5B%5D,%20int,%20int,%20float,%20float,%20android.graphics.Paint)\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#drawTextOnPath(char%5B%5D,%20int,%20int,%20android.graphics.Path,%20float,%20float,%20android.graphics.Paint). And how come the svg acid test compliant https://github.com/BigBadaboom/androidsvg/ isn't used?. I've just pushed a new branch, fixing most of my issues and most of the conformance with the examples from the spec page.\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/TextOnAPathLayoutRulesConformance. @chrisbolin I think I've fixed the issue, could you try with this and the latest commit in the master branch?\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { PanResponder, View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Rect, Text as SvgText } from 'react-native-svg';\nclass PanResponderWrapper extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.panResponder = this.getResponder();\n  }\n  getResponder() {\n    const yes = () => true;\n    const no = () => false;\n    const noop = () => null;\n    return PanResponder.create({\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: yes,\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: no,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: yes,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: yes,\n      onShouldBlockNativeResponder: yes,\n      onPanResponderTerminationRequest: yes,\n      onPanResponderGrant: noop,\n      onPanResponderMove: noop,\n      onPanResponderRelease: noop,\n      onPanResponderTerminate: noop,\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      {this.props.children}\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst Box = ({ onPress, onPressIn, onPressOut, label }) => (\n  <Svg\n    width={400}\n    height={100}\n    viewBox=\"0 0 400 100\"\n    style={{ width: '100%', height: 100, paddingTop: 10 }}\n\n<Rect\n  onPress={onPress}\n  onPressIn={onPressIn}\n  onPressOut={onPressOut}\n  fill=\"lightblue\"\n  x=\"10\"\n  y=\"10\"\n  width=\"350\"\n  height=\"90\"\n  rejectResponderTermination\n/>\n<SvgText x=\"30\" y=\"50\">\n  {label}\n</SvgText>\n\n\n);\n\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { count: 0 };\n  }\n  countUp(source) {\n    //console.log(source);\n    this.setState(({ count }) => ({ count: count + 1 }));\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n this.countUp('press')}\n          onPressIn={() => this.countUp('pressin')}\n          onPressOut={() => this.countUp('pressout')}\n        />\n    <PanResponderWrapper>\n      <Button\n        onPress={() => this.countUp('button')}\n        title=\"panResponder > Button\"\n      />\n    </PanResponderWrapper>\n\n    <PanResponderWrapper>\n      <Box\n        label=\"panResponder > Rect\"\n        onPress={() => this.countUp('press')}\n        onPressIn={() => this.countUp('pressin')}\n        onPressOut={() => this.countUp('pressout')}\n      />\n    </PanResponderWrapper>\n\n    <Text style={{ fontSize: 20, textAlign: 'center', padding: 30 }}>\n      {this.state.count}\n    </Text>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\n```\nN.B. The Rect element has the rejectResponderTermination attribute set. As per the source code  comments of Touchable:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/Libraries/Components/Touchable/Touchable.js#L368\njs\n  // ==== Hooks to Gesture Responder system ====\n  /**\n   * Must return true if embedded in a native platform scroll view.\n   */\n  touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest: function() {\n    return !this.props.rejectResponderTermination;\n  },\nOtherwise, on Android, the onPress/onPressOut handlers don't get called. As the PanResponder becomes the responder. But, now onPressIn gets called anyway at least. On iOS it seems to work for all three events even without the rejectResponderTermination attribute. I think it will probably disable scrolling if the Rect element becomes the Responder and the rejectResponderTermination attribute is set, but haven't tested it extensively yet.. This seems to work correctly on both iOS and Android with the latest version. Closing.. Seems like a version incompatibility. Closing.... You've mixed up 5.1.8 and 1.5.8, closing.. This is caused by a bug in react-native link, fix will be merged soon: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13783. Seems like an old version compatibility issue. Closing.... This isn't supported for now. PRs welcome.. Try this:\nnpm install react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#fee0d7d. @tastycode @iLeonelPerea my 5.1.7.1 version contains my latest fixes:\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/5.1.7.1\nOtherwise, try installing v5.1.7 of the original, as 5.1.8 is the first version which requires react 16+\nBut victory-native probably requires a bit more fixes still. Some of the issues are tracked here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/377. Try with the latest released version. Should be working as long as you only have a single react-native-svg in your dependency tree. Closing for now, reopen if you still have issues.. Published https://github.com/peterlazar1993/react-native-svg-example\nhere: https://expo.io/@msand/svgexample\nand updated readme.. @Nexuist To zoom a viewbox, you start with an initial affine transform of the identity matrix. When you handle a pinch/zoom event, you translate the center of the touches/interaction to the origin, scale according to the change in distance between the touches, and translate back to the center, (all operations are on the transform matrix). Then just multiply this matrix with the current one, and set the new resulting matrix as the transform on the root (zoomed) element.\nhttps://github.com/d3/d3-zoom might give some inspiration/clues.. @feluxz @dk0r @AlbertBrand @Nexuist @yangyi I've made an example here: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/svg-pinch-to-pan-and-zoom. @feluxz I've updated the example. Seems the Svg element had to be wrapped in a View, and set the PanResponder on that instead. Now it works in the iOS simulator as well, at least for me ;) I don't have any iPhone available to test on. Please try again! https://snack.expo.io/@msand/svg-pinch-to-pan-and-zoom. Another with start/mid/end alignment: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/svg-pinch-to-pan-and-zoom-with-alignment. I made a render-prop version of it and published it as a npm package called zoomable-svg \nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/zoomable-svg\nExample: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-render-prop\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nimport ZoomableSvg from 'zoomable-svg'; // 1.0.0\nconst { G, Circle, Path, Rect } = Svg;\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n (\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          )}\n        />\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. Hmm, haven't tried that no. Think this might interfere with that. Should probably detect the time between pressIn and Out, to decide if it should propagate the event to the child or not.. @feluxz Now it should support press handler in the child subtree. \nExpo: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-render-prop-press-handler\nVanilla: https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/commit/e032be15c4b5c57dae9fd51ce079de2d8dffa917\nChangeset: https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg/commit/9e6f73fee9b12cd11809712edb72d5ab6c156f48jsx\n/*\n * Sample React Native App\n * https://github.com/facebook/react-native\n * @flow\n /\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, G, Circle, Path, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nimport ZoomableSvg from 'zoomable-svg';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    toggle: false,\n  };\n  render() {\n    const { toggle } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n (\n            \n\n\n this.setState({ toggle: !toggle })}\n                />\n                \n\n\n          )}\n        />\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```.

It would be possible to set limits on either or both dimensions yes. It would just take min/max of the translations and scaling with the set limits. For draw and move, you either need different states for each, or you need a condition which only allows movement using e.g. pinch, and a large enough threshold on the amount of movement with a single touch before it responds as a draw command. You can perhaps take some inspiration from one of my older projects: http://infinitewhiteboard.com/ https://github.com/Infinify/InfiniteWhiteboard \nIts more of a laptop/touch screen or mouse adapted thing rather than fit for mobile in any way ;)\nI released v2 of zoomable-svg, to fully support viewbox transforms: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-v2.0.2. @feluxz Can you try using the plain react-native version (not expo) and the latest version of rnsvg, make a release build and test it on real phone hardware rather than emulation. For me it's smooth as butter on a OnePlus 3. Here's an example project https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest (uses cocoapods for ios dependency management) \nI'm not sure why the Expo version keeps crashing on android when releasing after pinch, @brentvatne @dustinsavery could you help here? Is there some special version of rnsvg built into Expo?. @feluxz I'm not sure, could you post a Snack or something? Might be that the coordinates aren't calculated correctly if the root is offset from the top left corner.. @Nexuist You can just invert the transform coming from zoomable-svg, for example like this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-v2.0.2-drawing-with-inverse-transform-example\njsx\n                <Circle\n                  cx=\"32\"\n                  cy=\"32\"\n                  r=\"4.167\"\n                  fill={toggle ?

'blue' : 'red'}\n                  />\n                ))}. @feluxz Released v2.0.3 and example which seems to work correctly: https://snack.expo.io/ryO6_PsSz. @Nexuist You should remove the viewbox from the svg root, and let zoomable-svg handle it for you, it does the viewbox calculation for you already and has accounted for it in the transform. So just set \n          vbWidth={720}\n          vbHeight={1000}\non the ZoomableSvg element instead of the viewbox attribute on the svgRoot.. Remove your initial zoom, instead set the left (min-x) and top (min-y) values for the viewbox something  like this: \n          vbRect={{left: -horizontalMargin, top: -verticalMargin, width: 720 + 2*horizontalMargin, height: 1000 + 2 * verticalMargin}}\nOr, make your content centered on the origin of the coordinate system and have a viewbox vbRect of {left: -halfWidth, top: -halfWidth, width, height}\nthen a zoom of 0.6 would scale everything about the origin, making everything come closer to the middle.. Another way would be to nest another G element with a transform, to translate and/or scale the content, but then you have to account for it in the inverse coordinate transform calculation as well.. @feluxz @Nexuist New version of zoomable-svg published: v2.1.0 now with constraining the extent of zoom and pan. And ability to control zoom and pan by setting zoom, left and/or top prop on the ZoomableSvg element. Here is an example of how to constrain the extent:\n jsx\n       <ZoomableSvg\n          align=\"mid\"\n          vbWidth={100}\n          vbHeight={100}\n          width={width}\n          height={height}\n          meetOrSlice=\"slice\"\n          svgRoot={SvgRoot}\n          constrain={{\n            scaleExtent: [0.5, 5],\n            translateExtent: [[-10, -10], [110, 110]],\n          }}\n        />. It has a similar api to d3.zoom\njs\n    const {\n      constrain: {\n        scaleExtent: [minZoom, maxZoom] = [0, Infinity],\n        translateExtent: [min, max] = [\n          [-Infinity, -Infinity],\n          [Infinity, Infinity],\n        ],\n      },\n    } = this.props;. New example, now with passing of child props: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-with-childprops,-constrain-and-animation. There were quite a few more ways to handle the combinations of edge cases. I've added a few more strategies for handling the constraints: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-v3\njs\nconst constraintCombinations = [\n  'none', // Demonstrates no constraints\n  'dynamic', // Adjusts translate extent according to zoom level and extent (Default and backwards compatible option)\n  'static', // Statically translate if scale extent allows zooming beyond a translate extent (same behaviour as d3.zoom)\n  'union', // Take the union of the zoom and translate extent\n  'intersect', // Take the intersection of zoom and translate extent\n];. Seems zoomable-svg covers this now. Closing unless any further issues arise.. @adrianboimvaser Do you have any performance test you could contribute? I'm planning to make some optimization changes soon, if time and priorities allow for it. The paths aren't properly reused if only the transforms change now. Should be possible to get quite decent performance improvements with relatively small changes.. @AakashKB Is this on android or ios? I suspect the touch events might be handled by a different target sometimes, not sure why, there seems to be something tricky with gesture responder system.. @sanealytics Lets say that top and left are 0 at first., and a touch event occurs, then initialTop/Left are 0, and initialX/Y are the coordinates where the touch started e.g. x = 10 and y = 20. Then for each new event, we take the difference (dx and dy) between the new coordinates and the first touch event, and add this to the initialTop/Left. Lets say you move ten pixels to the right, then x = 20 and y= 20, and initialX = 10 and initialY = 20, thus dx = 10 and dy = 0. The next state is then left = 10 and top = 0.\njs\n  processTouch(x, y) {\n    if (!this.state.isMoving || this.state.isZooming) {\n      const { top, left } = this.state;\n      this.setState({\n        isMoving: true,\n        isZooming: false,\n        initialLeft: left,\n        initialTop: top,\n        initialX: x,\n        initialY: y,\n      });\n    } else {\n      const { initialX, initialY, initialLeft, initialTop } = this.state;\n      const dx = x - initialX;\n      const dy = y - initialY;\n      this.setState({\n        left: initialLeft + dx,\n        top: initialTop + dy,\n      });\n    }\n  }\nThe logic from that example doesn't implement support for viewBox correctly and doesn't use page relative coordinates for the event handling, which caused some issues on android. For these fixes you can look at https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg/blob/master/index.js\nHere, the scaleX/Y, translateX/Y, input arguments represent the viewBox transform (mapping from the coordinates used in path data and svg components to screen coordinates with optional preserveAspectRatio and meet/slice), and the left, top and zoom are the additional transforms applied because of pan & zoom, and are given in screen relative pixel dimensions. \njs\nfunction getZoomTransform({\n  left,\n  top,\n  zoom,\n  scaleX,\n  scaleY,\n  translateX,\n  translateY,\n}) {\n  return {\n    translateX: left + zoom * translateX,\n    translateY: top + zoom * translateY,\n    scaleX: zoom * scaleX,\n    scaleY: zoom * scaleY,\n  };\n}. @sanealytics  I've made an example drawing app which might help you grok the transforms and how to add content: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/drawing-with-zoomable-svg\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  View,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Dimensions,\n  PanResponder,\n  TouchableOpacity,\n  Text,\n} from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nimport ZoomableSvg from 'zoomable-svg';\nconst { G, Path, Rect } = Svg;\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nclass SvgRoot extends Component {\n  state = {\n    paths: [],\n    currentPath: null,\n  };\nprocessTouch = (sx, sy) => {\n    const { transform } = this.props;\n    const { currentPath } = this.state;\n    const { translateX, translateY, scaleX, scaleY } = transform;\n    const x = (sx - translateX) / scaleX;\n    const y = (sy - translateY) / scaleY;\n    if (!currentPath) {\n      this.setState({ currentPath: M${x},${y} });\n    } else {\n      this.setState({ currentPath: ${currentPath}L${x},${y} });\n    }\n  };\ncomponentWillMount() {\n    const noop = () => {};\n    const yes = () => true;\n    const shouldRespond = () => {\n      return this.props.drawing;\n    };\n    this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n      onPanResponderGrant: noop,\n      onPanResponderTerminate: noop,\n      onShouldBlockNativeResponder: yes,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: shouldRespond,\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: shouldRespond,\n      onPanResponderTerminationRequest: shouldRespond,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: shouldRespond,\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: shouldRespond,\n      onPanResponderMove: ({ nativeEvent: { touches } }) => {\n        const { length } = touches;\n        if (length === 1) {\n          const [{ pageX, pageY }] = touches;\n          this.processTouch(pageX, pageY);\n        }\n      },\n      onPanResponderRelease: () => {\n        this.setState(({ paths, currentPath }) => ({\n          paths: [...paths, currentPath],\n          currentPath: null,\n        }));\n      },\n    });\n  }\nrender() {\n    const { paths, currentPath } = this.state;\n    const { transform } = this.props;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n            {paths.map(path => (\n              \n            ))}\n          \n\n\n\n            {currentPath\n              ? \n              : null}\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst constraints = {\n  combine: 'dynamic',\n  scaleExtent: [width / height, 5],\n  translateExtent: [[0, 0], [100, 100]],\n};\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    drawing: false,\n  };\ntoggleDrawing = () => {\n    this.setState(({ drawing }) => ({\n      drawing: !drawing,\n    }));\n  };\nrender() {\n    const { drawing } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n{drawing ?

I've made a more extended example app if anyone is interested: https://github.com/msand/InfiniDraw/ Universal svg drawing with pan and zoom. Builds on Next.js and react-native-web for the web version, and react-native for native apps.\nHas a stroke-width slider, a nice color picker modal with fading animation, graphql api and persistence to graph-cool, real-time collaborative updates, almost 100% code sharing across web, ios and android, etc. Can test the current web version here: https://infinidraw-zjiwdgcsln.now.sh/. This is caused by a bug in react-native link, fix will be merged soon: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13783. I think I might have fixed the issue now, can you try with the latest commit from the master branch?. Closing because of inactivity.. You could try my new branch I just pushed: \nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/TextOnAPathLayoutRulesConformance\nIt fixes quite a few bugs in android, I haven't worked on the ios part at all yet.. I have to go get some sleep right now, but I can do it in the morning :). It still had some problems, but your example helped me fix them. There is still one bug left, the text uses different amounts of width, in comparison to e.g. chrome.\n\n. It seems I managed to make it possible to render almost pixel perfect results now. Beware, it has a magic constant of 1.2 baked into two places, I suspect it might be dpi related, but haven't found the reason yet. Will test different screens/dpis tomorrow. Also the labels on the circle have their x value divided by 1.1 in the react-native version vs the web version, still trying to figure out what's causing this as well.\n\n. If you want to try out the minimal react-native, next.js, svgs, react-native-svg test repo you can clone from here https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug. I just noticed the glyphs in \"Choose shame or get war\" have their tranforms slightly off. Seems to be letterSpacing related, I can notice a similar effect on your example. Might be that kerning isn't working correctly, as setting letterSpacing to a valid numeric value seems to make the output identical.. Actually, letter-spacing is completely broken in native.. @chrisbolin I have letter-spacing and kerning implemented now as well (even chrome doesn't support the kerning attribute in svg yet). I've removed all magical constant and other strange things.\nIt is now possible to make it render similar output in both chrome and react-native in android, but native sometimes needs different font-size, letter-spacing, and start-offset values, seemingly depending on the length of the path referenced in the href attribute of the textpath element.\nExcept for that, it now seems at least possible to get essentially pixel perfect results for text, tspan and textpath, merely requiring scaling of some values for the native rendering.. I can make a pull request soon, meanwhile you can just install my fork... . I've merged the changes from master and made sure it works in my test project with the latest stable release of react-native 0.46.3 and the required alpha version 12 of react 16. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/402. I've also made a compatibility branch for RN 0.45, which only reverts the two merge commit for 0.46 compatibility. https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/5.2.0-conformance. I've also added more examples from the specs, demonstrating some issues mostly with the coordinate systems and more complex real-life svg: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/commit/ac20be4041d8e0b49c8dd4716d4c0b9912e2038f. \nThe remaining problematic examples. I've managed to fix all major remaining bugs with text rendering. There is one bug left which I suspect lies in the result returned by android.graphics.PathMeasure.getLength in https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/5.3.0-conformance/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L124-L125 or paint.getTextWidths in https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/5.3.0-conformance/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L148 which causes the midpoint of the glyph of the last character to sometimes be outside the text path, causing it not to be rendered. I have a special case for this in: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/5.3.0-conformance/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L178-L183 which uses the tangent from the start position instead, as a temporary workaround.. Updated full content scroll view screenshots in https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug\nStarting to look quite good, I must say.. Fixed the last bug as well, was related to the layout of ligaturized text sequences (e.g. \"fi\") and the methods I suspected.. Now the text rendering on android has my stamp of approval, should be good enough for most purposes, and if any bugs are found I can probably fix them with relative ease at this point. Images seem to have some strange effects related to translate/scale transforms and viewport/box sizes, which I might investigate at some point, but it seems others are looking into that as well right now.. @gpeal @chrisbolin can you test it out and verify that it works with your use cases?. @OzoTek It still hasn't been merged, so you have to use my fork from here: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/5.3.0-conformance\nso something like:\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#5.3.0-conformance\nOr a specific commit: \nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#36595c9. I've realized that the remaining letter-spacing issues are not actual issues with rnsvg, but with chrome and firefox etc. Edge implements it correctly according to spec, as we do. Same goes for rendering text on a path, chrome and firefox have never conformed to the spec, not even close. I've add a midLine prop/attr to TextPath, such that we can at least have the glyph midlines either according to spec, or compatible with the broken behavior of chrome/firefox... The letter-spacing compatibility with chrome and firefox just doesn't make sense, its far too complicated and removed from the language of the spec, much better to use Edge as reference, such that rendering is predictable from the svg spec.. Actually it's not even just the letter-spacing, its about calculating any glyph width or advance value, even for a single character its completely off. (In chrome and friefox that is, Edge does it perfectly). @OzoTek This is because I've changed the proptype of strokeWidth to be string instead of number. \nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/8892166ea3951e90531bb0533a723df8195f5494/lib/props.js#L42\nTo make it correspond/conform with the svg spec more:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-width\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#StrokeWidthProperty\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/painting.html#StrokeWidth\nUsage context\nCategories: Presentation attribute\nValue:  < length > | < percentage > | inherit\nAnimatable: Yes\nNormative document: SVG 1.1 (2nd Edition)\nThe value can be a generic length string with one of the units, or a percentage string. Of course we could allow numbers as well, because in practice, that is now converted to a string and a warning is shown instead. But perhaps it should be changed to a string instead of a number in victory-native instead?. @OzoTek I've changed the PropType to numberProp now:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/406/commits/553c17794e2887a4e686b7ce9541c91da9dd9b50#diff-5f58330644c215957cabd8bafa906d32R42\nnumberProp is defined as \nconst numberProp = PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]);\nSo, the latest commit in my fork shouldn't produce that warning anymore.. @OzoTek Or is your issue on the ios side? I haven't ported my changes to ios yet, and I expect to have done some breaking changes to the api contract from js to native. So, if you only experience this problem in ios, then this probably explains it. Have you tried android?. @OzoTek try this instead: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/6.0.0. Npm/yarn tend not to get the latest commit for the branch, once it's cached, using the latest commit hash instead of the branch helps against this or just flushing/clearing the cache. . Are you sure that you both rebuilt the native bundle and restarted the packager? Otherwise a small reproduction would be very much appreciated :) . And try this specific commit f3cd34f. Btw, warnings shouldn't show up in the production build. But there seems to be some other errors there which need to be dealt with as well. Any kind of repro would be nice, optimally a fresh react-native init:ed project with only minimal dependencies and smallest amount of code to show the problem. But just source code for an illustrative react component would be sufficient.. I've made a fresh new test project for easier testing on ios here: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTests\nSo, forking that, and adding another component would be perfect.. @OzoTek I've pushed new commit(s) https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/68eeb5e6daa832dda5d6c9b2b3f15883419bee48 for all the conformance branches / versions: 6.0.0, 5.4.0, 5.3.0, 5.2.0, 5.1.7.1\nThey work with your chart example, which I've added to the tests: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTests/commit/675ed32b9e9b831ba07e31a4f56c05ac4213a787\nThanks for your help!. @chrisbolin @gpeal @OzoTek There is now a new version and pull request, with some of the fixes from android ported to ios: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430. @chrisbolin @gpeal @OzoTek I've now ported almost all the fixes from android to ios here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430\nnpm i -s react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#13d5157. Everything regarding this should be fixed by now, closing. Reopen or create a new issue if there are remaining issues.. Can also try this: https://github.com/target/react-native-svg-parser. Place the values in an object which is accessible from the onPress event handler closure.. Seems like a linking error. Instructions available in readme now.. You can check out https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/master/src/index.android.js#L18-L28 to see how to get full width of the viewport, and adjust the relative height of elements. Essentially you need to measure the number of pixels available, set the width and height of the root svg element in px, and use the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio attributes to scale the content coordinate-system accordingly.. https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/images/coords/PreserveAspectRatio.svg. @awreese Sure. (btw, the last commit in the repository before the comment you refer to is this: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/tree/3b47667fbca150857297880cb7ae27728de5fc0f which you could've used to find the referenced code, or just look inside the native.js file of the current commit and read the code)\nCurrent commit:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/native.js#L23\nHere I get the width of the viewport window.\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nHere I pass the the width on:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/native.js#L34-L40\n<All\n          View={View}\n          width={width}\n          height={height}\n          native={true}\n          shadow={shadow}\n        />\nWhich I then pass on here to all the example components:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/components/all.js\nAnd then some examples of how to use it:\nFull width square viewbox\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/components/anchor.js\nFull width scaled height:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/components/request.js\nFull width, scaled height, translated viewBox:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/components/request2.js\nFull size, without preserving aspect ratio (stretches if you change width or height):\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/src/components/ViewBox.js\nFor the spec of preserveAspectRatio and viewBox check here:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#PreserveAspectRatioAttribute\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#ViewBoxAttribute\nExamples\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/images/coords/ViewBox.svg\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/images/coords/PreserveAspectRatio.svg\nBtw, I use the same \"All\" component in the web/next.js version:\nhttps://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug/blob/5a9f555db69b3bd22ead882479bce08653bb6415/pages/index.js\n<All\n    View={props => <div {...props} />}\n    width={980}\n    native={false}\n    shadow=\"/static/shadow-min.png\"\n  />;.

Alright, great. Btw, the pull request/fork contains lots of svg spec conformance improvements, for images, transforms, viewbox, gradients, text, text on a path etc. which will be released in the next major version: 6.0.0. Use the gesture responder system and the grant/responder termination request logic https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html. Looks great, I've made similar fixes to android inspired by your pull request. And some more fixes to viewbox and image translation / scaling / transformation. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/406/commits/8ffa2f3373e2fd9c9227459733a28b2b4ea1ae59. Great. I have a test suite in https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTextBug for comparing chrome and android, haven't started work on porting anything to ios yet. Just read my first objective-c syntax summary today and will start looking at that part soon. Meanwhile, if you're interested, you could adapt it to ios; to have more reference material.. @ScrimpyCat I've now ported almost all the changes from android to ios and we're tracking it here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/6.0.0\nWould you like to review it? So we get it good enough for merging into master and published to npm asap.. @michaelgobbers Can you try with the latest version? Or did you resolve the issue?. I'm currently working on improving/optimizing the glyphcontext memory use and computation. And, I got to borrow a mac yesterday, so I'm now learning objective-c to be able to port the fixes to ios.. Propagation, of multiple x or y values expressed as a comma or white-space separated string, over multiple nested tspans, is not supported yet. \nThe dx, dy, and, rotate attributes only support values relative to the current font's font-size, and user units, atm. \nOther units than viewport user units and x and y values expressed as a percentage of the nearest containing viewport are not supported. \nRight-to-left and vertical text is not supported either. \nOtherwise I think everything from the text related examples in https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ work correctly.. Optimally, the SVG 2.0 text layout algorithm should be implemented. It is quite explicit and clear worded, supports bi-directional, horizontal/vertical text, text on a path, even text layout content wrapping areas and shape-subtract: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#TextLayoutContentArea\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#TextLayoutAlgorithm. I think I've fixed all the remaining issues I listed today, except bidi and vertical text.\nI realized, svg inside svg (as in the PreserveAspectRatio example) doesn't work on android, would anyone have any clues why?. ViewBox, Text, Image, Gradient and Path rendering, and generic matrix transforms, in react-native-svg android; now conforms with chrome, firefox, opera, and, edge; on desktop windows 10. And, on mobile chrome and firefox on android.\nThe main remaining issue on android is the inclusion of svg inside svg. Any clues about this would be very helpful. It is possible to include jsx from other components, but the ViewBox transforms and PreserveAspectRatio would be quite useful to have as well.. I've made an alternative GlyphContext implementation, which should have better memory characteristics and computational performance. The hot-spots (methods which are called for every character / glyph) \n should be quite optimized in that version now. \nI haven't made any proper tests to compare performance yet, but at least in theory it should be significantly better on any text heavy svg view. Depending on various kinds of nesting and what attributes are set by how many ancestors, and how many values are set for one attribute in one node.. I merged the optimized version into this pull branch, as it seems clearly superior and closer to the svg 2.0 text layout algorithm as well.. I noticed units in the x, y, dx, dy and font-size attributes didn't work correctly, so I've fixed that too. Now font-size in % or em relative to parent font size should work. This probably requires an api change in the ios / objective-c code as well, to send all of these attributes as SVGLengthList (except font-size, which should be a String), i.e., a ReadableArray containing only String elements, in the js -> java case.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#InterfaceSVGLengthList. The implementation is good to go for porting to obj-c/ios now I think. There are some new units in css 3 / svg 2, and the named absolute and relative sizes aren't implemented either, but I think both of them are relatively rare in the wild still. So they can be implemented later on and ported across, probably without too much effort.. I just realized there might be potential for a large optimization still, by caching the character glyphs, such that if the same character is rendered more than once then it can just clone the Path corresponding to that glyph, instead of calling Paint.getTextPath every time.. I intend to implement this still before starting/meanwhile porting to obj-c:\nhttps://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#font-rend-desc . Alright, now Low-level font feature settings control: the font-feature-settings property is done, http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/#propdef-font-feature-settings\nReady for porting to ios, it is essentially feature complete at this point.. @magicismight Have you had any time to look at this?. @GeeWee Check out https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430 \nIt has almost all the fixes from android ported to ios now.\nnpm i -s react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#13d5157. Check compatibility in readme. .

This syntax works now. Closing.. Probably inefficient use of react and (missing) shouldComponentUpdate. Nothing to fix given this amount of information..

This should be working correctly now. Closing.. Press handling has been improved, and there no code/replication here to test. Closing.. Currently, when the extractStroke function is given a string in the strokeDasharray prop, it will split the string by (possibly white-space surrounded) commas, and maps the resulting sub-strings to numbers:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/ba4c649ebce6333c34c1857b30b7abc27a85a235/lib/extract/extractStroke.js#L33\nThus any string with a percentage sign would become NaN, as you can test in the browser console by typing +'1%';\nThe code currently expects numbers, and percentages are not supported the way they are defined in the svg spec. The map to numbers should be a map to strings and support for units and percentages relative to the diagonal of the viewport should be implemented.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#StrokeDasharrayProperty\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray\nAnd the split regex should be changed to allow for white-space separated lists:\nLists within SVG's XML attributes can be either comma-separated, with optional white space before or after the comma, or white space-separated.\ncomma-wsp  ::= (wsp+ \",\"? wsp) | (\",\" wsp)\nwsp        ::= (#x20 | #x9 | #xD | #xA)\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#WSP. I've implemented the fixes into my fork, same comment as here applies: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/417#issuecomment-319987960\n(android only). Can you try this? I'll close for now.. Wonderful, I thought it seemed a bit strange, couldn't come up with an explanation...\nGreat to hear! Thanks!. @awreese Thanks :) Now that ios is not crashing anymore because of my breaking changes, you can essentially use it. The ios text rendering isn't spec conformant yet and ios image/viewbox transforms are still somewhat broken, but I've started working on it. Not sure exactly how long it will take, as I have some obligations to deal with as well. But, essentially you can already start testing it just by: npm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg.git#6.0.0. Oh of course, my ios fix is still only in my pull request / fork, so you need to use:\nnpm install --save react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#6.0.0. @awreese @exKAZUu Check out https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/430 \nIt has almost all the fixes from android ported to ios now. Most importantly ligatures and kerning need a bit more work, except for that, most everything seems to be working correctly. If you find any weakness/error, then please report it :). Published https://github.com/peterlazar1993/react-native-svg-example\nhere: https://expo.io/@msand/svgexample\nand updated readme.. @magicismight @ssssssssssss I've now ported the new glyph context, font data, and, text rendering logic. Some minor issues with kerning and ligatures exist on iOS. And, some potential for optimisations exists. Would you like to have a look, and if you find anything you consider in need of / worth fixing, just make a comment/review. And then lets try to get it merged into master and published as the new major version. Quite a few people are anticipating its release.. I've mainly used the android version as reference, as I've already improved the conformance of that beyond chrome, firefox and safari, to similar levels as edge. It is very much a straight port, I've used https://developers.google.com/j2objc/ to make an initial conversion of the glyphcontext, fontdata and enums to obj-c, but had to remove almost all of it and rewrite/tailor make the rest anyway to fit closer to maintainable obj-c patterns and be readable at all. It contains two libraries for the moment as well, which can be removed, by rewriting to a tailor-made distance along a path algorithm / bezier curve length integration / numerical approximation (with adjustable tolerance) and position/tangent calculator. I just feel a bit of urgency to get something working out the door asap.\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#TextpathLayoutRules. I don't have any iPhone at hand to test iOS Chrome at the moment, but will try Safari in the iPhone simulator soon.. @magicismight Could you have a look asap? And merge or comment on anything that needs improvement before wider adoption/testing.\nnpm i -s react-native-svg@https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg.git#13d5157. \n. \n. @magicismight The code is now defect free as far as I know. Ligatures, kerning, fontFeatureSettings, and, baseline alignment/shift; are missing from iOS, for it to be feature complete. But none of those are really mission critical, and can be filled in later on.. Ligatures and kerning are now working in iOS.\nDon't know how to implement fontFeatureSettings, so will skip that.\nAlignmentBaseline and BaselineShift behave strange in iOS, they are always nil, works correctly in android. I'm unsure how to proceed, I must be missing something simple/fundamental.\nOtherwise, it is now essentially feature-complete and defect free in all the test-cases I have at the moment.\nAny suggestions anyone? @magicismight ?. @magicismight Hey, have you had any time to look at this?\nWould love to get this to master and npm \ud83d\udc93. @magicismight I've done some work on improving cocoapods integration, but not sure if the changes make complete sense, could you check it out? https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/tree/cocoapods. @magicismight I tried installing the latest commit using yarn, and it doesn't build in xcode, is there any way of getting npm/yarn to install git submodules?. The commit from my cocoapods branch should work without cocoapods as well, it just allows installing/including the lib in a xcode project using cocoapods as well, which makes it easier to set up continuous integration using e.g. fastlane and circleci. But when I changed how PerformanceBezier was included (directly instead of as a framwork, as I didn't get the original approach to work with cocoapods), it started complaining on some lines of code being incompatible with the ARC (automatic reference counting), and so I googled around and applied the suggested fixes (essentially just remove the lines of code), and thus I'm not certain if the memory is handled correctly anymore, or if all of it was even handled correctly according to obj-c best practices to begin with, and if it actually frees all the relevant memory. Have you looked at the memory behaviour of the current code?. @rh389 Yeah, they could be stored in the FontData structure by passing them to the glyphcontext, currently on android there are two helpers (missing from ios I notice now) handling the getting instead: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/04887af278c49a0fa3b7956d2992fb2e71efd279/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TextShadowNode.java#L139-L176 \nThe spec claims the property is not inherited: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-alignment-baseline\nThe baseline-shift can have a value of length and percentage as well, and thus need to take the correct coordinate system transformations into consideration, thus cannot have simple enum parsing.\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/04887af278c49a0fa3b7956d2992fb2e71efd279/lib/props.js#L224-L262\nalignment-baseline is parsed as an enum on android at least https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/04887af278c49a0fa3b7956d2992fb2e71efd279/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TextShadowNode.java#L52\nThe glyphcontext has a set of stacks, one for each property (stored as an array of input values, as they are glyph specific) which are set for the current element and any ancestors. \nIt also has a set of indices which keeps track of which input array is used in what glyph context (dom element), and another array which keeps track of what indices into these arrays are used (the spec says it should increment these for all ancestors, not only the current element, for each glyph/character)\nYou wont need to touch those, just pass along the alignment values to the fontdata and store them there, then in tspan getLinePath you get it from the fontdata instead of self.. @rh389 btw, the java version of glyphcontext actually has comments: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/04887af278c49a0fa3b7956d2992fb2e71efd279/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/GlyphContext.java. @rh389 I made a pull request with some fixes, including baseline alignment in ios and a commented and cleaned up glyphcontext (to align with android), can you try it out? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/527. @rh389 BaselineShift wasn't working correctly, so I amended the pull request with another commit. Now everything seems to be working fine.\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/527/commits/c8a2922ce7b81d257f7d0a76bd074ba1bf6c11a1. I think I might have fixed the issue now, can you try with the latest commit from the master branch?. Closing because of inactivity.. You're probably looking for react-native-svg-uri. @ntnamag Check e.g. https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot. Alternatively, call toDataURL. Try changing\n<AnimatedRect\n            x=\"0\"\n            y=\"0\"\n            width={0}\n            ref={ref => (this.rectangle = ref)}\n            height={dimension.healthManaBarHeight}\n            fill={`url(#HeathManaBar-gradient-${type})`}\n          />\nto\n<AnimatedRect\n            x=\"0\"\n            y=\"0\"\n            width={this.state.width}\n            height={dimension.healthManaBarHeight}\n            fill={`url(#HeathManaBar-gradient-${type})`}\n          />\nAlso, set an initial state value, and update this value on your animation event.. Alternatively you can interpolate the values, as in e.g. https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/blob/a74a600818e496efaa78298291b63107295064bf/App.js#L14-L57. Proper text chunk handling and the Unicode BiDi algorithm is missing. \nhttp://unicode.org/reports/tr9/\nThe relevant attributes:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/writing-mode\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/direction\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#DirectionProperty\nThe node icu-bidi package binds to the ICU (55.1) library in order to provide an implementation of the Unicode BiDi algorithm.\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/icu-bidi\nThis possibly makes sense to implement in javascript, just reorder the characters such that it becomes only left-to-right text, and rearrange any char dependent attribute value lists to take this into consideration (x, y, dx, dy, rotate attributes). Otherwise:\nServo has an implementation in Rust:\nhttps://github.com/servo/unicode-bidi\nJava also has one:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/Bidi.html\nAnd Apple, Windows etc. have ther own.. @hotmanhh Would you be interested in attempting to implement it?. @hotmanhh I've done some initial work here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/724\nBut have barely any insight into any right-to-left or top-to-bottom script and language systems. So I'm very much in need of assistance from native speakers/writers to get this further. What languages are you in need of? Persian/Farsi as well? Could you test and see if its good enough? And try to find the correct font feature settings to get the ligatures/cursive joins working as they should.. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/script-development/arabic\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typographic_features\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#DirectionProperty. Use at most screen size for the width and height, and use svg transform instead of rn transform to get fully sharp vector rendering. Or buy a phone with more memory.. @prabhu \nI have some manual / visual acceptance tests here: https://github.com/msand/RNSvgTests\nWhich I've used to compare the ios and android output to all the evergreen browsers, and fixed all the text and text on a path, matrix transforms, viewbox, ligatures, kerning, etc. related issues I've found.\nThere are several collections of unit tests for the various SVG spec versions. What is needed, is to implement and expose the proper getters, setters, and methods, of the DOM, which are required for the unit tests to compare the actual values to the expected values in the assertions.\nIn practice, the tests I've collected into that repo, require almost all parts relating to text rendering to be implemented correctly, as almost everything is both tested in isolation, and in ways such that all the properties depend on each other, and affect the output together. This even allowed me to discover that only Edge renders text on a path according to spec, all other ever-green browsers implement something which is nowhere to be found in the spec.\nhttps://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues/337\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/13518804/\nThe Edge team wants it to be handled by the w3c, I haven't contacted the other browser vendors yet.\nAlso, Adobe Illustrator has invented their own interpretation of startOffset, where the percentage value p gives p = ( m / n ) , where m is the m:th control point in the bezier curve, and n is the number of control points, while everybody else calculates a percentage of the total pathLength of the entire curve.\nIf you're interested in fixing and helping with the unit tests, you can look at the SVG DOM api spec, and just implement the getters required by the tests you consider most important. This would allow many thousands of the existing unit tests to be run already. Then, implementing the other missing methods and we should be golden. What do you think?. Use fetch to download resources over http(s).. @HighSoftWare96  It gives the most recently reported size, communication over the bridge is async, so if you're animating it might already have changed. Otherwise it should stay up to date for each re-render.. I've published a new version without native dependencies, and updated the readme. I have it working fine with cocoapods at least.. You can use a WebView instead, almost the same functionality/end-result. SVG 2 supports multi line and shape-inside line-breaking. So when the layout algorithm for that is properly implemented, it should be much better. I've already started it, and just a few things to do left and then it can be integrated: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/6.0.0/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TextLayoutAlgorithm.java. Otherwise, just position view and svg elements absolutely.. I would recommend splitting your svg into a foreground and background layer, and place a native view with what ever you need in between. This will be more performant (reuses the resulting bitmaps of the svgs) than using the svg rendering logic to make bitmaps of other native components (rerendering all of it on any change in the foreignobjects) + handling hit testing and gestures etc.\nOr what would be your use case? . Alternatively, if we would rewrite to do the native measure, layout, invalidation passes and draw/render using the native canvas and display lists (instead of merely re-rendering to a bitmap if invalidated, and rendering the bitmap by adding it to the native canvas display list) and use the native hit testing instead of custom logic, then we could probably allow nesting arbitrary react-native and plain native views inside. Not sure how it would affect performance though, quite possibly a nice speedup if implemented correctly.. I realized that clipping and masking of native content might be useful, and once we have filter support, that could also be used for all kinds of purposes. Reopening this.. 12.5.

Any svg or math element, and their descendents, will be parsed as being in the SVG or MathML namespace, respectively; all other tags will be parsed as being in the HTML namespace.\nSVG-namespaced elements within a \u2018foreignObject\u2019 will not be rendered, except in the situation where a properly defined SVG fragment, including a root \u2018svg\u2019 element is defined as a descendent of the \u2018foreignObject\u2019..

Please try google and stackoverflow etc.. I've remove all dependencies and aligned the versions with react-native init. This shouldn't be an issue anymore.. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#notice. I would recommend you upgrade react-native to the latest version, and react to the same version as depended on by that, and then use the latest version of react-native-svg. It seems your viewbox value is incorrect at least. Its probably using the wrong transformation.. @ziyafenn have you run react-native link ? Otherwise, try linking manually. @ziyafenn Hmm, I can't see libRNSVG.a in your linked libraries, are you using cocoapods?. @oliviachang29 Do you have $(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-svg/ios in \"Header Search Paths\" in recursive mode? And have you rebuilt your native bundle after linking the library?. I've tried this multiple times but can't replicate. Please provide a full replication. Closing for now.. If it doesn't crash and renders correctly it's probably fine ;). Do you have any fill/stroke for the touch interaction to intersect with? Otherwise it won't make the hitTest succeed.. Or can you post a complete reproduction?. Alternatively you can wrap it in a View and set the panResponder on that, e.g. like this: https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg/blob/master/index.js#L281. @psivanov I think I might have fixed the issue now, can you try with the latest commit from the master branch and this code:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { PanResponder, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\nimport { Rect, Svg } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class DesignSpaceContainer extends Component {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    console.log('WILL MOUNT: design space');\n    this.panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: this.handleStartShouldSetPanResponder,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: this.handleMoveShouldSetPanResponder,\n      onPanResponderGrant: this.handlePanResponderGrant,\n      onPanResponderMove: this.handlePanResponderMove,\n      onPanResponderRelease: this.handlePanResponderEnd,\n      onPanResponderTerminate: this.handlePanResponderEnd,\n    });\n  }\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\nhandleStartShouldSetPanResponder = e => {\n    console.log('start set pan responder: design space');\n    return true;\n  };\n  handleMoveShouldSetPanResponder = e => {\n    console.log('move set pan responder: design space');\n    return false;\n  };\n  handlePanResponderGrant = e => {\n    console.log('grant: design space');\n  };\nhandlePanResponderMove = e => {\n    console.log('move: design space');\n  };\nhandlePanResponderEnd = e => {\n    console.log('end: design space');\n  };\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  root: {\n    flex: 1,\n  }\n});\n``. Is this still an issue? Can you provide a full reproduction?. This seems to work correctly in the latest version, please comment if that's not the case.. Sorry for this, my fault. I changed it because the rotate attribute in text elements like e.g. tspan was applied both to the glyph and the entire element. Other svg elements shouldn't interpret the rotate attribute (although react-native-svg allows transform definitions as attributes, which is not part of the svg spec). At the same time I had removed support for rotate transform definitions in the transform attribute by mistake. If you change:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6.0.0/lib/extract/extractTransform.js#L139\nfrom:rotation: +props.rotation || 0,to:rotation: +props.rotation || +props.rotate || 0,`\nthen it should work again. \nTo conform with the spec, we should remove support for transform definitions as straight attributes, and remove support for the \"rotation\" definition, only keeping the transform definition form of rotate.. Also the optional parameters of rotate aren't supported, and there is support for some attributes/definitions which aren't in line with spec: skew, translateX, translateY, origin, originx, originy, scalex, scaley. And value separation using whitespace (comma-wsp) is not supported causing incorrect handling of e.g. two parameter scale definitions without commas to separate them, etc.. Full rotate is supported as a transform definition in the transform attribute now. Closing.. Have you tried building in android studio? seems you're missing this from your gradle configuration https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/build.gradle#L38\nAnd what SDK version are you using, have you tried 25? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/511#issuecomment-344567146. I've removed appcompat from the dependencies, shouldn't be an issue anymore.. @suhabaobaid Can you try upgrading? The latest version shouldn't even have the dependency.. Feel free to provide a PR, closing for now.. This is failed linking issues, follow the manual linking instructions.. I think this might be because of how the width and height props are handled. They're not sent as props over the bridge to the native side of the svg root component, they're given as dimensions to the react-native view/stylesheet yoga handling layer. I guess they're not causing any invalidation on the android side and thus no re-rendering. I'm currently looking into adding support for nested svgs and will probably have a fix for this issue at the same time because of related changes.. @DaKaZ Can you try my new PR, it should update when changing width/height and it also allows nesting svg. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596. @axelnormand That is correct. Alternatively, you can put e.g. a text element with opacity 0, and put a counter inside which you increment, or some other arbitrary property which causes an invalidation of the tree.. @ferpalma21 I think the issue is that you're drawing black on a black background, so it's all black. Try this with the latest version:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst Building = ({ width = '100%', height = '100%' }) => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n. Closing this as viewbox works correctly.. Is this resolved, can it be closed?. @maxkomarychev I think I've fixed the issue now, can you try with the latest commit from the master branch and this code:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Alert, Platform, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport SVG, { G, Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst showEvent = message => {\n  console.log(message);\n  // Alert.alert(\"Touch handled!\", message, [{ text: \"OK\" }], {\n  //   cancelable: false\n  // });\n};\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \nCircle\n\n\n {\n                showEvent('circle onPressIn');\n              }}\n              onPress={() => {\n                showEvent('circle onPress');\n              }}\n              onPressOut={() => {\n                showEvent('circle onPressOut');\n              }}\n              cx=\"50\"\n              cy=\"50\"\n              r=\"40\"\n              stroke=\"green\"\n              strokeWidth=\"4\"\n              fill=\"yellow\"\n            />\n          \n\n    <Text>Group</Text>\n    <SVG width=\"100\" height=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n      <G\n        onPressIn={() => {\n          showEvent('group onPressIn');\n        }}\n        onPress={() => {\n          showEvent('group onPress');\n        }}\n        onPressOut={() => {\n          showEvent('group onPressOut');\n        }}\n      >\n        <Circle\n          cx=\"50\"\n          cy=\"50\"\n          r=\"40\"\n          stroke=\"green\"\n          strokeWidth=\"4\"\n          fill=\"yellow\"\n        />\n      </G>\n    </SVG>\n\n    <Text>Circle onPress</Text>\n    <SVG width=\"100\" height=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n      <G>\n        <Circle\n          onPress={() => {\n            showEvent('circle onPress');\n          }}\n          cx=\"50\"\n          cy=\"50\"\n          r=\"40\"\n          stroke=\"green\"\n          strokeWidth=\"4\"\n          fill=\"yellow\"\n        />\n      </G>\n    </SVG>\n    <Text>Circle onPressIn + onPress</Text>\n    <SVG width=\"100\" height=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n      <G>\n        <Circle\n          onPressIn={() => {\n            showEvent('circle onPressIn');\n          }}\n          onPress={() => {\n            showEvent('circle onPress');\n          }}\n          cx=\"50\"\n          cy=\"50\"\n          r=\"40\"\n          stroke=\"green\"\n          strokeWidth=\"4\"\n          fill=\"yellow\"\n        />\n      </G>\n    </SVG>\n    <Text>Circle onPressOut</Text>\n    <SVG width=\"100\" height=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n      <G>\n        <Circle\n          onPressOut={() => {\n            showEvent('circle onPressOut');\n          }}\n          cx=\"50\"\n          cy=\"50\"\n          r=\"40\"\n          stroke=\"green\"\n          strokeWidth=\"4\"\n          fill=\"yellow\"\n        />\n      </G>\n    </SVG>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\n```. Closing because of inactivity.. @amorenew I've done a bit of work on implementing the text layout algorithm from svg 2.0, which supports bidi text, but not currently working on it: \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6.0.0/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TextLayoutAlgorithm.java\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#TextLayoutAlgorithm\nThere is actually not that much left to it, only a few parts where the spec needs to be translated/expressed as code, and then taken into use in\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6.0.0/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java. If you want to mirror something, you can use transform translate and scale(-1,1) as in:\n```\n Learn about this code on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Transformations \n\n\u00a0   \n\nabc\n\n\n```\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/yeuj98au/. Not sure about this really, will close this for now. Reopen if its still an issue.. @brentvatne @magicismight I can perhaps help share the maintenance load to some degree, at least while working on project(s) using it as a dependency. My iOS/Apple is a bit limited, but my stronger knowledge of the js and svg specs / implementations can probably cover for that.. Rather, use the standard svg transform attribute and the rotate transform definition. Such as here e.g. https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg-example/pull/7/commits/e5616d29fc707da68ea895d02a633bf78a4dd495#diff-b241035fb407e61e7ec1900126acf94cR23. You can install it using:\nnpm i -S react-native-svg@6.0.0-rc1\nor\nnpm i -S react-native-svg@https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg.git#6.0.0\nor\nnpm i -S react-native-svg@https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg.git#be8797b\nInstallation using yarn does not work, as there is a git submodule required now and only npm installs those.. @HilSny I'm referring to the 6.0.0 branch and the PerformanceBezier library, which you can see here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6.0.0/.gitmodules#L5-L7\nThe SDK works fine with 25 and can even be upgraded to 26. \nIf you have many dependencies you might even need to do it for all of them, and upgrade the gradle android build tools, and appcompat at the same time. \nThis has given the best compatibility and stability for us so far, and significantly faster native build times (especially combined with the latest android studio preview version and beta/rc of gradle and build tools etc). Which is great for e.g. native debugging & bugfixing.\nAs long as you keep minSdkVersion at 16 its fine and you can make that higher as well if your user-base is on newer versions. The sdk mostly opens up new things, upgrade some others, and makes some changes to the permissions model, nothing to fear.. @adrianboimvaser There might be bugs with it still, can you try using svgs (universal wrapper around react-native-svg and web svg), and make sure it renders correctly in an evergreen web browser at least, with the same dom structure and attribute values as you're using now. \nEspecially, I suspect multiple transform definitions in one transform attribute might be broken at least and possibly related. The tests I have in https://github.com/msand/newproject/ and https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-example/tree/6.0.0 seem to be working correctly.. What versions or react, react-native and react-native-svg are you using?. Haven't used it in Expo, only without it. Can you make a minimal replication repo using the latest versions of react-native init and react-native-svg?. @jabajaj Are you still having this issue? Can you try with v6.1.0?. Make sure you've rebuild the native bundle after upgrading react-native-svg, this is probably caused by not doing that.. Fixed in master.. Can you try with the latest version and see if its fixed?. Haven't seen this issue myself, and there's no response nor replication. Closing.. Can you post a replication of this? Or did you resolve the issue? Can this be closed?. @winghouchan Sounds good, looking forward to your PR \ud83d\ude04 . Here is an ugly workaround: https://snack.expo.io/rJm7SuQyf\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, Dimensions, Platform } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nconst android = Platform.OS === 'android';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst { Rect, Path } = Svg\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isDown: false,\n    path: ''\n  }\ngetCoords(e) {\n    const { locationX, locationY } = e.nativeEvent\n    const X = parseInt(locationX)\n    const Y = parseInt(locationY)\n    return [X, Y]\n  }\ndown(componentType, e) {\n    let [ X, Y ] = this.getCoords(e);\n    if (componentType === 'svg' && android) {\n      Y -= height / 2;\n    }\n    this.setState({\n      path: ${this.state.path}M${X},${Y},\n      isDown: true\n    })\n  }\nmove(e) {\n    if (this.state.isDown) {\n      const [ X, Y ] = this.getCoords(e);\n      if (Y > (height/2)) return\n      this.setState({\n        path: ${this.state.path}L${X},${Y},\n      })\n    }\n  }\nup() {\n    this.setState({\n      isDown: false\n    })\n  }\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n true}\n          onMoveShouldSetResponder={() => true}\n          onResponderGrant={this.down.bind(this, 'native')}\n          onResponderMove={this.move.bind(this)}\n          onResponderRelease={this.up.bind(this)}\n          style={{ width: '100%', height: '50%', backgroundColor: '#eee' }}\n        />\n        \n\n 'none'}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\n. I suspect the event handler is called twice on android in svg elements, once with correct coordinates and once with coordinates relative to the root view. I subtracted the distance from the root in the down event handler and skipped any event larger than the intended svg viewport size in the move event handler.. Yes, you would then have to adapt the subtraction of the distance to the root in the down handler, i.e. removing this:\n    if (componentType === 'svg' && android) {\n      Y -= height / 2;\n    }\n```\nAs I said, it's an ugly hack, and merely a proof of concept which shows the underlying error.. Can you try again with the latest commit from the master branch? I've fixed some issues with the gesture responder logic and think this might be fixed as well.. Closing because of inactivity..

Is this on the latest version?. @szakhlypa Great catch, my fault, I had no earlier experience in Obj-c either and put that together in a hurry. Would you like to set up a pull request?. Rotate support has been published. Thanks for the work and PR anyway! I'll go ahead and close this.. @ljunb seems it might be a kerning related issue. A workaround might be to wrap the problematic character in\u4efb. @ljunb I found an issue in the handling of ligatures on ios, and suspect this issue might have been related. We're you having issues on both platforms or only one? Could you try my pull request and see if you can remove the workaround now? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/558. I figure, on iOS at least, the kerning table lookup still uses the non-ligature glyphs, might be related to that. But quite strange that it is version dependent, seems it could be a native iOS CoreText issue.\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/blob/17a66f3c2c36bd7aff359d9a71b57510a2dae055/ios/Text/RNSVGTSpan.m#L267. Please provide a full replication. Closing until that's made available.. New versions have been published, and I haven't seen these issues, nor more reports. Will go ahead and close this for now.. @kuongknight Did you resolve this or is this still an issue?. Closing this because of inactivity.. I've just released 6.0.1-rc.2 which removes PerformanceBezier and QuartzBookPack. Can you please test it? \n@stefan-messmer\n@dantman\n@turtec\n@hatlestad\n@ulisinn\n@tybro0103\n@thibault12\n@sampsasaarela\n@glacjay\n@nishantxeno. @jwrubel Are you sure you've rebuilt the native bundle? The stroke width should be a string, as it can have various units (em, %, px, pt etc.) https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/e4269aed9f257e1829746dd53b923444a1c220c9/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m#L75-L82. @Softrabbit-de Versions of RN/Expo? Could you make a repo with a reproducible error?. These errors almost certainly result from upgrading react-native-svg, but not rebuilding the native ios code, while still running the updated js code.. I think you have to eject from expo if you want to change the react-native-svg version, as otherwise you cannot change the native build. Expo has a prebuilt version, which seems to be pre v6. @brentvatne @dustinsavery would it be possible to get a new version into expo? any special requirements or tests that should pass?. @rori4 You probably forgot to rebuild your native bundle. Or are you using expo?. @spierr Expo has a pre-built native version of react-native-svg, which is incompatible with the js code of the latest version. Either eject from Expo, or make a version upgrade request to the expo team, or downgrade to a compatible version. ping @brentvatne @dustinsavery . Seems we should add a Expo version compatibility table to the readme.... @spierr You can see it here: https://github.com/expo/expo-sdk/blob/c893c9c50a27f57370c2e4a18e98834c1012315c/package.json#L61. I've made a PR: https://github.com/expo/expo-sdk/pull/102. @ide I'll close this for now. But would be great to notify people here, if Expo updates the version. Not sure who has the rights/responsibilities to handle that, but thought you might be the right person.. There definitely seems to be some bugs with the image positions and viewbox handling. I made a small expo test https://snack.expo.io/@msand/image-test @ulisinn could you try making one like that?\nAt least the offset handling is off, the x-axis behaves strange, and if the viewbox on the root element is set to non-zero min-x or min-y, then it incorrectly affects the image ancestor as well.. @ulisinn @stefvw93  @dustinsavery  I have a new pull request with some fixes for image positioning and other improvements, could you test it? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/558. @ulisinn Are you still having any issues relating to this? I'll go ahead and close now. Reopen if you have any bugs to report.. Closing until a replication showing how the behavior differs from other svg renderers is made available.. Please provide a full repo as a reproduction. Closing until then.. @evaldsurtans @dustinsavery @stefanoeb @elailai94  I have a pull request removing both QuartzBookPack and PerformanceBezier, resolving this and some other issues. Could you try it and help verify it works correctly? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/558. I've just released 6.0.1-rc.2 which removes PerformanceBezier and QuartzBookPack. Can you please test it?. Everything should be working fine now. Closing this.. @adamski @joshbroton I tried making some small changes and it seems to work on both expo and latest react-native-svg:\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@msand/-lineargradient-rendering-black-#540-fixed. Strange, for some reason it reverts to the inital state when saving to my profile, try this: https://snack.expo.io/Bk6eSpGdG. Closing as this seems to be fixed/non-issue.. This is caused by a bug in react-native link, fix will be merged soon: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13783. @codesinghanoop Check here e.g. https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/blob/a74a600818e496efaa78298291b63107295064bf/App.js#L14-L57. Very cool, looks great!. I've removed the appcompat dependency completely now, so this won't be needed anymore. Closing for now.. @adamski @dustinsavery @anonrig I have a pull request removing both dependencies. It should fix your issues. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/558. Try adding this to your Podfile: https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/blob/fe45f88a936181e6ecaddeb68268d33268b56121/ios/Podfile#L66-L70. These issues should be resolved, closing for now.. ClipPath isn't specified to work that way. Please make sure that svg supports your expected behavior in browsers first.. Version? Have you tried latest?. Seems to work fine: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/eager-bubblegum. You need to have a viewbox which makes a unit in user space correspond to a pixel on the device. And then use percentages in your coordinates instead. Or, calculate the number of units per pixel and use that in your strokeWidth.. I've removed appcompat from the dependencies, this shouldn't be an issue anymore. . @msageryd You probably need to use something like:setNativeProps({ matrix: [scaleX, skewY, skewX, scaleY, translateX, translateY] })`. Great, posted a slightly more thorough answer there: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47995367/1925631. Cross-posting here for reference: \nThe VirtualNode (android) and RNSVGNode (ios) implementations have setMatrix methods. Give new property values by sending a column-major array representation of a transform matrix definition over the bridge. As in:\nsetNativeProps({ matrix: [scaleX, skewY, skewX, scaleY, translateX, translateY] }). The thing to note is that the composition of skews, rotations and translations is non-commutative, i.e., the result depends on the order of the transforms. And the six values do not correspond to parsing any kind of composition of these or angle interpretations, merely as scalar values using straight matrix interpretation. Thus the labels are slightly misleading, but gives at least some clues for how to interpret/adjust them if you want to bypass the transform parser.. Check this e.g. https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg-example/blob/cfb788461efae0de367c97aadcc829cdeb959a8d/examples/TouchEvents.js#L46-L85. The transform parser had a particularly nasty bug, where it would ignore the exponents of any numbers.. I've just released 6.0.1-rc.2 which removes PerformanceBezier and QuartzBookPack. Can you please test it?\n@kesha-antonov \n@anonrig \n@louuysison \n@ssssssssssss \n@adamski\n@lukemiles. @simonbuchan Well, at this point it implements support for transform syntax fully and correctly, as far as I know. Or are you seeing any issues related to transforms at this point? And, how is this related to the language, rather than a specific library? Its not like obj-c or java or any lower level languages would have built in support for svg either. Conformant renderers seem quite hard to find even Qt, OpenFL and all the browsers: chrome, firefox, safari, ie, etc. still have issues after quite a few (thousand?) person-years of development.. Ah alright, I misunderstood \ud83d\ude04. @alexcittadini You can use https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/panresponder.html for that. Can get a bit of inspiration from this perhaps: https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg/blob/9e6f73fee9b12cd11809712edb72d5ab6c156f48/index.js#L106-L148. https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/RNTester/js/PanResponderExample.js. Can't really understand this. Please elaborate on what you want to achieve. Closing until then.. Actually, https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/graphics/PaintCompat.html is used in https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L700\nIf requires either an appcompat version including an implementation of that, or at least api level 23. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html#hasGlyph(java.lang.String). @hwangjr I've aligned the versions with react-native init, and copied the latest PaintCompat source into the repo, such that the appcompat dependency could be removed. Hopefully we'll have less people having version conflicts and issues now.. Closing until questions in https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient/pull/255 are answered.. I've just released 6.0.1-rc.2 which removes PerformanceBezier and QuartzBookPack. Can you please test it?. @felipebraga You can try running this if you want: https://github.com/peterlazar1993/react-native-svg-example. https://expo.io/@msand/svgexample. @nating @msageryd The standard syntax is supported in the latest versions, since https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/507 was merged. The non-standard attribute and transform object requires using the rotation property name rather than rotate, not to collide with the standards conformant rotate attribute on text elements.\nAn example of the standard transform attribute can be seen here: https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/commit/49c97ab48b7ada3e634d73175f792ac331a39579#diff-958f6f56cd42c904603d226cd36a57b6R39\njsx\n<Rect\n  x=\"0\"\n  y=\"0\"\n  width=\"65\"\n  height=\"65\"\n  fill=\"white\"\n  transform=\"rotate(45, 32.5, 32.5)\"\n/>\nAnd some examples from the spec can be seen here: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-example/blob/SpecTests/src/components/Nested.js#L23\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-example/blob/SpecTests/src/components/RotateScale.js#L16. It came with https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/507 so its relatively new. The transform parser isn't available in Expo for example... A bug in react-native currently links the tvOS library into the iOS project as well.\nUntil the fix is released: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13783 https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a63fd378a47173cc9f750e9980f18dc12dd7ea51\nFollow the instructions here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/544. I guess this is just linking issues then. I'll go ahead and close for now.. You can use the transform attribute with the rotate(<a> [<x> <y>]) transform definition, e.g. \njsx\nconst rotate90DegTransform = contentToRotate => (\n  <G transform=\"rotate(90)\">\n    {contentToRotate}\n  </G>\n). Only 2D rotation transform is supported for now, rotateZ that is. The 3D transforms rotateX/Y only work on react-native view elements. Generic 3D transforms require a 3x4 matrix, while we're sending a 2x3 matrix for now.. I'll go ahead and close this for now.. This is probably just using the Text component from react-native instead of react-native-svg, and isn't supported for now. I'll go ahead and close this.. Are you using expo? It comes with a pre bundled version of react-native-svg and can't be combined with others. . Can you post a replication? I don't know how to make this issue appear. Fixing this would probably allow nesting Svg elements inside each other as well, which I'm not sure why it doesn't work, haven't investigated it properly yet. @magicismight @brentvatne @dustinsavery you have any ideas?. @emilsjolander @gaearon @sebmarkbage you have any ideas here? What is required to make nest-able native components? And pass the bounds/render targets correctly for the layout?. Actually, I'm starting to suspect these lines of code:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/VirtualNode.java#L325\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/ios/RNSVGNode.m#L316. I have a pull request with support for nested Svg in both iOS and Android. And support for nested React-Native Views in iOS, but haven't found a way to make the nested native views render in Android.\nIn iOS the UIViews have a drawRect method which can be used, not sure what is the equivalent in the Android side. @grabbou Would you know anything about this? Or know who might know?. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/commits/b5eeb1ee72913a902d9fd3af53a09ac297c7bbba#diff-fa14c1736ff5bb76d7293042d3c2c436R140\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/commits/b5eeb1ee72913a902d9fd3af53a09ac297c7bbba#diff-ad00a658e353800d7617ab962a7438b7R59. @gut4 I now have a proof of concept working in Android as well, can you try it out?\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/commits/f7b195a5a08387d2619c3e26854c473af49d846e\nWhat kind of behaviour do you expect around positioning and layout? How do you expect flexbox and svg to interact? I now have the origin of any native content in to origin of the svg canvas, independent of any viewbox and preserve aspect ratio, transforms etc.. Link to PR https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596. Have you tried both ios and android? Could you make a repro in a git repo?. @jnicholls What is behaving differently?

Closing this, as nesting svg inside svg works, and another issue is already open for foreignObject support: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/447. Oh, interesting, haven't considered that properly. It is because of how the text measure is calculated:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L298\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/ios/Text/RNSVGTSpan.m#L295\nShould add the correct amount corresponding to letter-spacing there.. This will actually depend on ligature substitution as well, and might require a bit of thought.. This can probably be worked around for now by using two render passes, first with plain Text and TSpan elements (no TextPath) and a onLayout handler on the root Text element, to measure the text length, and then, adjusting the placement along the textpath accordingly, slightly like in this approach/workaround but a bit more advanced: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/907. Not sure. Do you have time to work on it? . The text rendering should be split into several passes per Text element root / anchored subtree. First to do bidi transformations and other text-shaping to find the glyphs, advances and positions + rotations. Allowing to get the sums of advances per text chunk, to shift the first character of the anchored chunks by half the extent of all the anchored text in the subtree. And another to actually render the glyphs in their positions, or along textPath defined curves.. I think i've fixed this now. Can you try with the text-anchor-subtree-calculation branch? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/text-anchor-subtree-calculation. You can use the git uri for now. In practice nothing changes except a single line in your package.json, this library has no build process, as you probably noticed from it already working for you when you verified the fix. A new version will come in due time. Putting it to npm just changes from where you fetch the bytes. And who tracks what how. . @oleksandr-dziuban Can you provide a reproduction?. @oleksandr-dziuban Could you provide a reproduction?. Yeah a minimal reproduction would be great. The smaller the better.. Looks like you're giving incorrect data to react-native-svg-uri.. I've just released 6.0.1-rc.2 which removes PerformanceBezier and QuartzBookPack. Can you please test it?. Great! Is the code available anywhere?. The latest version doesn't have the duplicate symbol issue anymore, I recommend upgrading :). Have you tried doing the transformation on a containing react-native view instead? Keep the svg unchanged, and, ensure it either doesn't re-render or at least uses the cached output of the text rendering.. @msageryd Put a breakpoint here:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/ios/Text/RNSVGTSpan.m#L71-L73\nand here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L74-L76\nand make sure it uses the cached path, or that the sub-tree containing it isn't invalidated.. Are you setting native props on the text element? Have you tried only setting it on the G element? Does it still invalidate the text cache?. I haven't actually looked at the invalidation nor verified that it is only done when needed. You could set breakpoints in all the places where invalidate is called, or the cached path release, and try to find out why it keeps re-rendering.. There are probably some optimization opportunities here. Could split the calculation of the path for the elements, and the composition of the matrix with the path, to render it to the canvas. Such that if only the matrix transformation changes, it doesn't need to recalculate what to render, only to re-render the same content with a possibly different transform. This would also complicate the logic a bit, but essentially, having two different invalidation handlers, one for transforms (doesn't clear the cached path), and one for changes which can affect the content (clears the cached path), should speed up simple transform animations significantly.\nAnd, looking at the code now, I'm starting to think the cached text paths are always released no matter what right now. I would have to step through the relevant logic to verify. I'm sure there's lots of low hanging fruit here.. Well, using PureComponent would probably simplify reasoning about your code at least, but limiting updates and diffing, e.g. if you know that only exactly one property has changed on a single node, such as the matrix in this case, it is probably still faster to make the bridge set that single property directly on the node using the setNativeProps, and skip the lifecycle with all its property extraction, transformation, diffing, etc. \nBut, making sure that all nodes cache their paths, and reuse that if only the matrix changes, should certainly make rendering more fluid in both cases. And, correctly used data structures and property passing, such that all the PureComponents only ever need to do a single reference equality check each, for a use case dependent splitting of responsibilities into composed components and according to their relative update frequencies, should make the ux good enough for some unknown larger amount of rendering work.\nAnyway, intelligently applied mutability can certainly speed up the hottest parts of your render loop, usually with a trade-off in reasoning complexity, in any single threaded von neumann architecture at least ;) In a more parallel (eg. opengl) or distributed processing unit/environment you probably want to avoid mutating shared state and synchronization as much as possible instead. And, if you need to render large amounts of work, you should probably look at moving over to the accelerated gl hardware asap.. One thing which would be very helpful is if you could make some representative performance tests that we can use to compare the effects of various changes. Alternatively, ensure the all nodes cache the path, invalidate if any content affecting property changes, cleanup correctly when detached, and make sure that changing the matrix property only causes invalidation of the hitareas and a rerender, no invalidation of the cached paths.. Ok, sounds good. I haven't actually spent almost any time on optimizing nor profiling React-Native yet, I would have to google around a bit first for the state-of-the-art. The next sprint at work will finally have some time allocated for this kind of work, so at that point at the latest I'll check the available tools. If rnsvg shows up as the top priority bottle-neck, or if we manage to fix any other potentially more fruitful optimizations first, then I'll be able to put something else than my free-time on this.. @msageryd I've now made some changes to the caching of paths, but I don't have any good performance tests yet so it hasn't been tested much at all. You can check it out here https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596\nThe changes were relatively minor in the end:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/commits/149f4601084a4ba3cec56844e4c91ff4f2c4ef62\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/commits/db8f1da46b3439435f6b057897936955d229f4bb\nThe branch also supports nesting View inside Svg, and Svg inside Svg, the changes from this might have some performance penalty as well (at least on android).. While testing it in a project, I noticed some regressions with the transforms, something stays stale in the cache, so the current work in progress isn't ready for production at least. Any help with testing much appreciated.. Alright, looking forward to it \ud83d\ude03 The issues were caused by using texture view on android, so i reset the branch to before that and merged it in. The optimizations are available in the latest version.\n. Hmm, interesting, perhaps you could do a git bisect to find what commit causes the issue? I'm not currently working on any react-native project, so I'm not sure how much time I'll be spending on maintaining this right now.. At least one of the issue lies with the path caching. Would need to add a recursive releaseCachedChildPaths method to RNSVGContainer, traversing the tree while there's any cached paths, such that any nodes which depend on updated parent properties can rerender, or revert the caching logic altogether.  . Btw, thanks for bisecting and narrowing down the issue. We can probably keep the discussion here for now, as the earlier messages are somewhat related to it anyway. But feel free to open separate issues if you feel like it, or come up with even better ways to describe them, it might help others investigate as well. Especially if you can make minimal reproductions, that would be great \ud83d\udc4d\nRegarding the text elements and x/y props, are you changing them using setNativeProps or using normal prop diffing?\nCan you try reverting the change made to RNSVGNode.m in https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/db8f1da46b3439435f6b057897936955d229f4bb#diff-fd13a4ce6718d799f74859c5145670a3L133, specifically the method: \nobj-c\n - (void)setMatrix:(CGAffineTransform)matrix\nsuch that you call \nobj-c\n    [self invalidate];\ninstead of \nobj-c\n    id<RNSVGContainer> container = (id<RNSVGContainer>)self.superview;\n    [container invalidate];\nIt's a bit hard to figure out your current setup without access to the code, and as I don't have any way to replicate the issue at the moment I'm not sure how to proceed either. Have you tried with the latest version btw?. @msageryd Published v7.0.0 now \ud83d\ude04 . @msageryd Thought you might be interested in a very successful optimisation strategy I applied the other day. It works great to speed up animations/gestures where you're only transforming some parts of the content, or where some parts of the svg content changes rarely but various layers need relative transforms and clipping. \nIt roughly goes like this: Cover the area you want to respond to gestures with an Animated.View/ScrollView, split the svg content you want to animate independently into separate svg roots and wrap them in an Animated.View, then connect the gestures to transform the entire results of rendering the svg content into bitmaps using RN transform arrays and useNativeDriver: true. \nThis way the svg doesn't need to rerender the bitmaps at all, and it uses native Views to clip and transform the content instead.\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@msand/soundcloud-player-fast-animation-cross-platform\nThere's a bit more info on medium: https://medium.com/@dnasleakim/the-fast-cross-platform-end-result-of-my-investigation-can-be-found-here-ed2f0ac79ac7\nExpo required a bit of extra logic for Android. But the iOS version seems to work fine in the latest rn and rnsvg.\nhttps://medium.com/@dnasleakim/and-for-the-grand-finale-the-fastest-possible-i-think-8eccf71f6e2c\nMight be easier to follow the chain of optimisations in chronological order on my profile, as the responses became a bit of a tree over time.\nhttps://medium.com/@dnasleakim/responses\nE.g. the first change I made was based on looking at the time profile and noticing the endTransparencyLayer was the main time consumer, so I moved the opacity from being on thousands of rects onto a single G element instead, making it already quite usable. \nThen, trying to make the bitmap smaller seemed to improve a bit, but the best was just not to rerender any bitmaps at all (especially screen sized), merely clipping and transforming the view of the bitmaps, invalidating the dirty areas and as little extra as possible. \nIn practice, this runs the whole interaction of the app using only native code, the js is only used to set up the native view hierarchy which then does the initial single render of the svgs, sets up the native gesture responders and animations, and gives full 60fps interaction.. I'll close this now as it's not really an issue anymore I guess. Reopen if performance issues remain.. This actually refers to https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm which has been merged into react-native core. The whole statement could be removed.. I'll go ahead and close this. Thanks for the PR anyway!. @glacjay Looks good. Thanks for this!. What version are you using? The master branch and my latest pull request https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/558 has a transform parser where your content works correctly. It can even be reduced a bit (could be reduced more e.g. merge the two nested G elements into one, or could even be just a single path element):\n```js\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { G, Rect } from \"react-native-svg\";\nexport const IconClose = () => {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  );\n};\n. @dustinsavery Could you review this? I don't have ts in use in any current project of mine. Or, @simonbuchan do you have a test repo where I could test the publicly exposed interface surface? It seems this doesn't require a semver major version change?  . @simonbuchan Could your matching problem have been related to this? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/586/files. @Nexuist You should use a transform to zoom your canvas instead. The width and height of the root svg element decides the resolution of the resulting rasterized bitmap, the viewbox decides how the bounding box maps to coordinates in user space, and the transform attribute allows scaling and translation of the content in this coordinate system. So, instead of zooming the rasterized pixels and getting pixelated output, it zooms the vector paths to render and clip them accordingly.. @Nexuist I've made an example here: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/svg-pinch-to-pan-and-zoom. Anyone in need of zoom and pan functionality can check here: https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg\nWill close this for now.. Btw, splitting the already rendered paths and the currentPath being drawn into separate components and svg roots should probably speed up your user experience. Keep the dom of the actively changing part as small as possible and move any more static parts into a separate component with some simple shouldComponentUpdate logic.. We had to use the same trick in https://infinitewhiteboard.com thought it might be useful for you as well \ud83d\ude04 .

NinjaXY try putting your onPress handler on the circle or rect instead as in: https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg-example/pull/7/commits/e5616d29fc707da68ea895d02a633bf78a4dd495#diff-72145b9bb2d9b248b3cc6379238dd173R173jsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nOr something more like this: https://snack.expo.io/HJuqTiJHM\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { G, Circle, Path, Rect } = Svg;\nclass SvgToggle extends Component {\n  static title = 'Tap the shapes to change state';\n  state = {\n    toggle: false,\n  };\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n                this.setState({\n                  toggle: !this.state.toggle,\n                })}>\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n{this.state.toggle ?

Create e.g. a Rect or Circle with the color o the background for the entire area you want to be touch sensitive.. This might be a limitation of the current touch event & hit target intersection logic.\nI'm not sure, as I haven't debugged nor looked at that part of the code almost at all.\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableShadowNode.java#L292\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/GroupShadowNode.java#L116\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m#L286\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/ios/Elements/RNSVGGroup.m#L100\nI suspect it will require changes in the native code to fix properly, but might be possible to create your own https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/panresponder.html or perhaps drop down a layer to just https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html\nSomething a bit like this: https://github.com/msand/zoomable-svg/blob/88fe49b82d64419930ac4f83352b454101280bf1/index.js#L225-L282\nBut, with your own should respond and should capture logic, which calculates the correct bounding boxes for your shapes, takes the intersection with the touch event, and makes the topmost shape handle it.. How about this? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/582. Published 6.0.1-rc.3 now. Please try it out.. Hmm, what version of Android studio are you using? Can you try building using the latest?. Do you have Android Studio installed? Try installing the latest of that: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html. @jskidd3 Have you tried these changes? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/581#issuecomment-359201096. @jskidd3 I think you're looking at appName/node_modules/react-native-svg/android/build.gradle rather than appName/android/build.gradle. @dlimx  @lepouya How come FBSDK uses SDK 26 and appcompat 27.0.2\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk/blame/master/android/build.gradle\nWhile react-native uses these? @jpshelley @grabbou \n    compileSdkVersion 23\n    minSdkVersion 16\n    targetSdkVersion 22\n    appcompat 23.0.1\nand old gradle versions?\nPerhaps I should make a PR upgrading them all (except min sdk) to the latest stable versions?\nGoogle has this to say about targetSdkVersion:\nTo maintain your application along with each Android release, you should increase the value of this attribute to match the latest API level, then thoroughly test your application on the corresponding platform version.\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html\nhttps://medium.com/google-developers/picking-your-compilesdkversion-minsdkversion-targetsdkversion-a098a0341ebd\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/platforms.html#sdk-versions\n. Made a PR https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/17747. I think I just found a more than good enough reason for upgrade: Path Traversal Vulnerability. @pacamara @sibelius I guess meanwhile the PR is open, we could revert these changes. But, should we change them to align with the latest stable react-native init, or revert to the previous versions, what do you think?. Although, now that I think about it. The latest changes have semver pre-release identifiers, and the other changes have been there for some time already. Perhaps best to wait and see for a bit more response on the PR.\nhttps://semver.org/#spec-item-9\n\nA pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes.. @pacamara @sibelius I've released a new version, which aligns with react-native init, to make it as easy as possible for newcomers. Anyone with needs to upgrade any versions to anything different from that, will hopefully learn how to change them in their dependencies in the process as well. Lets see if they upgrade any versions, now that a PR exists. Can release a new version to align with that when they do.. Your native bundle is old, and doesn't use the latest version, which supports units in the strokewidth. The units require a string to be passed, as a number cannot represent it.. Can you check that you have google() in both of these?\nhttps://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/blob/master/android/build.gradle#L6\nhttps://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/blob/master/android/build.gradle#L24. No worries. You can find it in appName/android/app/build.gradle where appName is the root of your project.. Oh sorry, appName/android/build.gradle is the one with the top-level repository configuration for all sub-projects/modules in the project. The one in the app folder is app specific.. Try changing to this:\n```\n// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.\n\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        google()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.1'\n    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong\n    // in the individual module build.gradle files\n}\n\n}\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        mavenLocal()\n        jcenter()\n        maven {\n            // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm\n            url \"$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android\"\n        }\n        google()\n    }\n}\n```. Make sure you have v4.1 of the gradle wrapper as well:\nhttps://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/blob/master/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties\n```\nThu Jan 18 18:05:34 EET 2018\ndistributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\ndistributionPath=wrapper/dists\nzipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\nzipStorePath=wrapper/dists\ndistributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.1-all.zip\n. When you open/build the project in the latest Android studio, it asks if you want it to make these upgrades for you.. Can you try cleaning and rebuilding the project? Preferably in android studio, as it gives better error messages and helpful automation for these things.. Now its probably the app specific build.gradle file:\n[android/app/build.gradle](https://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/commit/ef571ce0f65297663b7360b0b363605f93c8735e#diff-dc46f9f5dfe204e394fb41395ccd03cfL97)\n@@ -94,12 +94,12 @@ def enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture = false\n def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = false\nandroid {\n-    compileSdkVersion 25\n+    compileSdkVersion 27\n defaultConfig {\n     applicationId \"com.svgpodtest\"\n     minSdkVersion 16\n\n\ntargetSdkVersion 25\ntargetSdkVersion 27\n         versionCode 1\n         versionName \"1.0\"\n         ndk {\n@@ -138,7 +138,7 @@ android {\n dependencies {\n     compile project(':react-native-svg')\n     compile fileTree(dir: \"libs\", include: [\"*.jar\"])\ncompile \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.4.0\"\ncompile \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.0.2\"\n     compile \"com.facebook.react:react-native:+\"  // From node_modules\n }\n```.

I guess the later one (higher z-index) will intersect with the touch event and override the earlier one. To get correct handling of 3d, we would have to send 3x3 matrices to the native implementation, currently we send a 2x3 matrix, as svg currently only supports 2d transforms, except on the root element. You can find some inspiration here https://medium.com/@youngchanje/implementing-cube-in-react-native-cb61b9a7e8c3\nYou could calculate path data yourself, and do the 3d transforms of the coordinates yourself before sending them to the native side, but then you have to handle z/buffering & occlusion culling yourself. Or use something like: http://seenjs.io/demo-multi-views.html or\nhttp://kovacsv.github.io/JSModeler/documentation/examples/svgto3d.html\nPerhaps a better alternative would be for you to implement support for the upcoming svg 3d transforms: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-Transforms/. Actually, for 3d content and transforms, opengl will be a much better match.\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gl-model-view\nhttps://github.com/gre/gl-react-native-v2\nOr, if you only need to rotate rectangles, then you can just use plain react-native views with a background color and the normal 3d transforms.. @NinjaXY Here is an example of animating 2.5d(getting quite different results on android and ios, but something to start working/investigating from at least) and correct press handlers:\n```jsx\n/*\n * Sample React Native App\n * https://github.com/facebook/react-native\n * @flow\n /\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, G, Circle, Path, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nimport ZoomableSvg from 'zoomable-svg';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst AnimatedSvg = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Svg);\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nclass SvgRoot extends Component {\n  state = {\n    toggle: false,\n    zAnim: new Animated.Value(0),\n    initAnim: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(\n      // Animate over time\n      this.state.initAnim,\n      {\n        toValue: 1,\n        duration: 3000,\n        useNativeDriver: false,\n      },\n    ).start();\n  }\n  moveV = () => {\n    Animated.timing(this.state.zAnim, {\n      toValue: this.state.zAnim._value > 0.5 ? 0 : 1,\n      duration: 1000,\n      useNativeDriver: false,\n    }).start();\n  };\n  toggle = () => {\n    this.setState(({ toggle }) => ({ toggle: !toggle }));\n  };\n  alert = () => alert(1);\n  noop = () => {};\nrender() {\n    const { toggle, zAnim, initAnim } = this.state;\n    let rotZ = zAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['0deg', '-45deg'],\n    });\n    let translateRootX = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: [0, 50],\n    });\n    let translateRectY = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['0', '50'],\n    });\n    const { transform } = this.props;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```. Seems the perspective values are interpreted differently on android and ios.. Well, if you add another dimension to your information and make your rendering dependent on it, then you have to do the required math to have the correct results ;) It doesn't have to be matrices, but the mathematically equivalent computation has to be done somehow.\nThe native rendering stack allows for 3x3 matrices. if the z-order (what objects are in front of what other objects, and thus occluding them, as they will be rendered in DOM order rather than furthest away first) doesn't change over time/interaction, then it would be enough to add support for sending 3x3 matrices using e.g. setNativeProps, allowing you to just calculate a single transform matrix per element/group you want to transform independently in 3d.. Thanks for this. Looks great!. Didn't know about this one. I think it should be possible. At least the parts from the css color spec should be relatively easy, just check the color prop on the current element, take that, or if it says 'inherit' then traverse upwards until you find an actual color value, either on a svg element or some other react-native element, with fallback to default black perhaps? As the spec says that Initial: depends on user agent\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#color0\nNot sure how to get the current color of the containing (non-svg) element though, you have any idea?\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#currentColor-def\n4.4. \u2018currentColor\u2019 color keyword\nCSS1 and CSS2 defined the initial value of the \u2018border-color\u2019 property to be \"the value of the \u2018color\u2019 property\" but did not define a corresponding keyword. This omission was recognized by SVG, and thus SVG 1.0 introduced the \u2018currentColor\u2019 value for the \u2018fill\u2019, \u2018stroke\u2019, \u2018stop-color\u2019, \u2018flood-color\u2019, and \u2018lighting-color\u2019 properties. CSS3 extends the color value to include the \u2018currentColor\u2019 keyword to allow its use with all properties that accept a  value. This simplifies the definition of those properties in CSS3. \ncurrentColor\n    The value of the \u2018color\u2019 property. The used value of the \u2018currentColor\u2019 keyword is the computed value of the \u2018color\u2019 property. If the \u2018currentColor\u2019 keyword is set on the \u2018color\u2019 property itself, it is treated as \u2018color: inherit\u2019. \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#SpecifyingPaint\ncurrentColor\n    Indicates that painting is done using the current animated value of the color specified by the \u2018color\u2019 property. This mechanism is provided to facilitate sharing of color attributes between parent grammars such as other (non-SVG) XML. This mechanism allows you to define a style in your HTML which sets the \u2018color\u2019 property and then pass that style to the SVG user agent so that your SVG text will draw in the same color.\nhttps://css-tricks.com/currentcolor/. Only the Text element has partial inheritance support\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text.html#limited-style-inheritance\nAnd, we can't put svg elements inside of them. Only text elements have the color style prop, Views do not. So I think this can only be supported inside the svg content.\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text.html#style. Well, svg content as produced by spec conformant user agents do contain and depend on inheritance to render other parts of the content correctly. In this case, unless the components are used with the svgs and react-native-web packages, it shouldn't matter that much if the color doesn't cross from the react-native view backed components to the react-native-svg backed ones, while it would in web version where it would be html and normal svg content following the css spec. I'm not sure how much this property is used though? Do you have much content depending on it?. @ctgardner You can have a single G element in the root of your svg content, wrapping all of it, allowing the child elements in the subtree to inherit the colors from that already.\nI made an example with that + a onLayout pattern to make an Svg component (which takes a width and height property) and fills the available space in its parent: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/demonstrate-onlayout-to-fill-parent-and-inheritance-of-fill-color-props.\nSimilarly you could use context to provide system/app wide defaults. https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html. Are you running the latest version of Expo?\nYou can have a build step, which generates the react-native components from the .svg files using something like: https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-to-react-native-cli\nor alternatively something like this: https://github.com/vault-development/react-native-svg-uri/issues/12#issuecomment-283671157. You might want to pre-process your svg content with something like this: https://gist.github.com/msand/4b37d3ce04246f83cb28fdbfe4716ecc\nIf your content is not rendering the same in native as the web e.g. because of css related things.. I have basic currentColor support here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/1827b918833efdaa25cfc1a76df2164cb2bcdd2b. This is a limitation in React Native as far as I know. Just keep your Svg elements outside any Text elements.. Probably similar issue to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46613149/tried-to-register-two-views-with-the-same-name-progressbarandroid\nand\nhttps://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/commit/54c92d0640e8765e4ab3d624dc1577bcc4ed7bfa. Alright, I'll go ahead and close this.. If you're using yarn, then you can use resolutions: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json#toc-resolutions\nE.g. if you're using react-native-svg v8.0.8 and want to override it in all your dependencies, add this to your package.json file and run yarn again:\njson\n  \"resolutions\": {\n    \"react-native-svg\": \"8.0.8\"\n  }\nOr, if you're using npm, then you can run: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-force-resolutions#how-to-use\nsh\nrm -r node_modules\nnpx npm-force-resolutions\nnpm install. @vjsingh Expo already includes react-native-svg, you shouldn't add it as a dependency.. @abduraufsherkulov if you use expo, then this library comes built in and you shouldn't add it as a dependency, also make sure none of your other dependencies depend on it. Or, eject the project. . That sounds correct, Expo should probably change their setup, such that they also expose the react-native-svg module.. You can find examples of ejecting from expo: https://github.com/msand/InfiniDrawExpo\nto ExpoKit: https://github.com/msand/InfiniDrawExpo/tree/expokiteject\nor to plain react-native: https://github.com/msand/InfiniDrawExpo/tree/nativeeject\nAnd the original project which has both web (using react-native-web) and plain react-native here: https://github.com/msand/InfiniDraw/. I don't have any iPhones available, so unfortunately I can't help with testing. But, I might be able to give some amount of guidance, if you have any specific questions :). These are probably related:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/433\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/376\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/363\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/157\nWe should probably use/copy the gesture handling logic from the React-Native touchables.\n.

I don't have access to any iPhone at the moment, so I can't really troubleshoot or verify any solutions to this issue at all. Any help in getting this closed would be much appreciated!. @ewalti I think I've fixed most of the issues now. Could you try this code with the latest commit in the master branch:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Rect, Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class touchesMove extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n console.log('circle')}\n          />\n           console.log('rect')}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nAdding the onPress on the Svg element seems to have inconsistent behaviour still, on Android it logs for the root element, on iOS for the innermost hit target.. Seems Android requires rejectResponderTermination on the inner elements, if you want the inner element to respond instead of the outer one.. Can you try this fix? (for iOS) https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a\n. I think I have (gesture) interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. Closing this until further notice.. @DanBeard Thank for the PR! Have you seen https://github.com/godaddy/svgs it does essentially the same thing, but handles some of the quirks with react-native-svg perhaps a bit better. Do you still think merging this pr is needed?. A pull request for doing that would be awesome and very much appreciated! \ud83d\udc4d . I'm wondering if we should re-open this? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/608. I've published a fork of svgs using createElement from react-native-web now, under the name swgs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/swgs. Hmm, haven't seen this before, Could you post a complete replication/snack/repo?. I think you're probably adding a React-Native Text element instead of a react-native-svg Text element inside of the Svg subtree in your render function. Impossible to say without a complete reproduction, this only gives a fraction of the required information.. You can use `as ImportedBinding` in your ImportSpecifier, that is, rename or give an alias to the exports with colliding names from react-native and react-native-svg.\nIn expo, as it is exposed as the Svg export, you can assign to new variable names in a destructuring assignment like this instead: https://snack.expo.io/HyfwCmHLfjsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text as NativeText, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Text: SvgText } = Svg;\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n          Text outside svg\n        \n\nText inside svg\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```. @Matan Thanks for reporting this! I've pushed a 6.1.3 tag to the release commit, can you verify it works? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/releases/tag/6.1.3. @AntonNixonNixon  @sibelius I have an attempt for supporting nested native text views on android now, can you test it and see if it behaves according to your expectations? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/658. I believe  @sibelius is thinking of nesting native text inside images, which isn't supported on android. Native text and views inside svg are possible, we just need to define how it should work. The current implementation probably doesn't even make sense, the CTM should probably propagate from svg to rn views.. Could it be related to this? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/293 Can you try reverting this change and see if it helps?. Is this still an issue?. Please provide a full reproduction if this is still an issue. Closing until then.. Currently any optimization from clipping would be done by the native os rendering layer, RNSVG doesn't limit what children it makes svg renderTo:context calls to, as changes in transformations can make any parts appear and reappear, affecting what other parts of the dom have visible parts in the clip bounds. The clipbounds are just to ensure you won't affect pixels outside/inside some shape for the moment.. Without an isolated reproduction its a bit tricky to help much more than this.. There might be some issues in how transformations and clip bounds are composed, or just a missing invalidate call or something like this.. This seems really strange, seems like either a bug in react, or something like a shouldComponentUpdate returning false somewhere, short-cutting the diff of the tree. Otherwise I can't think of anything which could allow for this behavior. Force update shouldn't be needed either. A complete reproduction would certainly make it easier to analyze.. Have you tried doing the forceUpdate on the parent of the element you're doing it on now instead?. I would recommend using the normal lifecycle for the rendering, filter the data before the rendering, to reduce the number of actual elements in the tree to only the ones which are visible. Then use forceUpdate only when your changes affect properties of a single (or a small number of) element(s) not add/remove elements from the tree, on e.g. touch interactions on single elements and such. But when you add/remove elements from the tree, use the normal lifecycle.\nOtherwise you will probably need to keep your workaround, or something else which will hide the selection-highlight by changing properties on the preserved pre-existing element. This is probably working as intended, if its stays visible on forceUpdate and disappears on proper re-render. When you give new props directly, the new props are sent to the native side and native render is called, but the tree re-conciliation is only done on proper render, as I understand it, for now at least.\nIt might be possible to get the rendering fast enough, merely by using dependency tracking and immutable data structures together with the normal react lifecycle and PureComponent/shouldComponentUpdate. Such that updating the position of one element, causes an efficient recomputation with structural sharing, such that only one element needs to do more than a shallow comparison on an object/array to re-render correctly.. Have you tried forceUpdate on the root of the svg tree?. Its seems my first message had not been sent, but was still in an open tab on another computer \ud83d\ude04 Here it is:\n You can e.g. put breakpoints in the setters on the native side, for the props you're changing, and make sure the invalidate/markUpdated calls are made to cause a re-render.\nAlternatively, if you're changing the width and height of the root svg, then I already have a fix for android (ios was already working).\nThe width and height props were needed for nested svg elements as well, so I added the props and attributes on the element:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/files#diff-e60ff2a48c5c8ade5b35db8858761655R86\nand setters (with invalidate calls) for ios:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/files#diff-fa14c1736ff5bb76d7293042d3c2c436R85\nand for android (markUpdated calls):\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/596/files#diff-14006468fef576216e161290553af6e8R82. Hmm, well actually I weren't thinking of Immutable.js the library, just plain js used immutably. But if you have a calcVersion to track the need to re-render, then you can keep your list of shown objects mutable as well, just keep the elements of that list immutable, such that when you map over the list to render them, your components only need to do a reference equality comparison to decide if they need to update, and in the parent/container just use either the calVersion, or make a copy of the list using something like:\njs\nconst arr = this.state.slice();\n// Not strictly immutable, but the immutability invariant is only broken on construction.\n// Reference checking is still enough to know that changes have occurred.\narr[elementToUpdate] = Object.assign({}, arr[elementToUpdate], updates);\nthis.setState(arr);\nBut, copying the arr is definitely more expensive than incrementing a calcVersion integer, so, might as well keep that, if profiling your code says that this is the hottest part of your rendering logic anyway.. So yeah, if you use a calcVersion you can use splice on the array instead, so something like:\njs\nconst arr = this.state.arr;\narr.splice(elementToUpdate, 1, Object.assign({}, arr[elementToUpdate], updates));\nthis.state.calcVersion++;\nAllowing to use PureComponent for mapping the elements in the render method. Or components with a single reference equality check in shouldComponentUpdate to decide if updates are needed.. But I guess just assigning is the fastest, so \njs\nconst arr = this.state.arr;\narr[elementToUpdate] = Object.assign({}, arr[elementToUpdate], updates);\nthis.state.calcVersion++;\nAnd the same will probably apply to the actual elements as well, as creating new objects all the time will cause pressure on the garbage collector. So, if you want to trade off the memory, just add calcVersion integers to the elements in the array as well and use that for deciding the need for rerender instead of acting immutably, if maximal performance is wanted. Alternatively, if your elements have very few properties, just set those as plain (non-object data type) attributes on PureComponent extending classes. Profiling the different tradeoffs in release build on real hardware is the way to investigate this properly anyway, and focus on the real hotspots.\nThen again, if you are doing really performance critical stuff, you should probably use c/c++ instead with SDL, or one of the game frameworks or something else for running as much as possible of the rendering in the opengl pipeline instead.. I'll go ahead and close this, as it seems to be working as designed. Re-open if otherwise.. @mchen37  Can you provide a full replication?. I think this is fixed in the latest version. Please reopen if you still have issues.. Chrome renders closer to spec here definitely. The easiest way to get this working correctly is probably to finish the SVG 2.0 text layout algorithm. I've started implementing it here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TextLayoutAlgorithm.java\nAnd then porting it to obj-c as well of-course. The text-anchor middle should essentially shift the first character of an anchored chunk in a line by half the extent of all the (anchored) text in the chunk or the sub-tree of the Text element. PRs very welcome!. @henricazottes I haven't had any time to look at this. Feel free to work on it. A simpler workaround might be to implement another method on the Text elements, which gets the sum of advances of all the anchored text inside the sub-tree, and using that value to shift the text. Should be much more straightforward than implementing the entire svg 2.0 text layout algorithm.. This can probably be worked around for now by using a onLayout handler on the root Text element, and translating the group as a whole, a bit like in this: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/907. I think I might have fixed this for iOS now\n\n. Shouldn't be too hard to port the changes to android either.. I think i've fixed this now. Can you try with the text-anchor-subtree-calculation branch? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/text-anchor-subtree-calculation. Wonderful! Many thanks for this. Will test it today and merge it in.. Hmm, can you be more specific?. Could you make a PR fixing this?. Looks great. Will test it and release new minor version.. Published new version 6.2.0 Thanks for this!. There was a minor issue with the paths https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/13487029c07e3d0602e1bd61b554118919875875\nReleased a patched version 6.2.1. Hmm, are you using cocoapods? Have you run pod install? Was working when I did some quick tests this morning, I'll have to double check.. Alright, seems there was a problem with the paths, was working with cocoapods, and of course I didn't test in a fresh project, thought the one I tried should be enough of validation. Now it (v6.2.1) works in a fresh react-native init + link + manually remove libRNSVG-tvOS.a + run-ios. I'm unable to replicate, works when I test it. Could you post a full replication? \nWhat I can remember now, only the font handling in android has changed, to support custom fonts. Can't remember changing the logic in iOS for that.. Is this still an issue? Please comment or reopen if so.. Custom fonts have been fixed, try with the latest version.. Its seems the path data parser interprets the relative move from the closed path incorrectly. Try changing to an absolute move command instead as a workaround until the parser is fixed:\njsx\n    <Svg viewBox=\"0 0 127 55.2\" width=\"127\" height=\"55.2\">\n      <Path fill=\"#231F20\" d=\"M110.5 26.1c.6-1.2 2.2-1.4 2.7 0 .7 2 .2 4.5.5 6.9.2.6.5 0 .6-.2.9-2.6 1.5-5.6 3.3-7.1.8-.6 2.7-.2 2 1.6-1.6 4-3.8 7.9-4.1 12.7-.2 2.9-2.3 11.2-3.8 13.8-1.1 1.8-3.8 2-4.6 0-.5-1.2-.9-3 .2-3.8.8-.6 1.8.4 2 1.6 2.1-2.2 2.4-6.6 2.9-10.1.3-2.2-1.1-4-1.2-6-.2-2.2-.5-4.3-.6-6.5-.1-1.1-.3-2.3.1-2.9M127 25.8c0 .4-.1.9-.3 1.2-.2.4-.5.7-.9.9-.4.2-.8.3-1.2.3-.4 0-.9-.1-1.2-.3-.4-.2-.7-.5-.9-.9-.2-.4-.3-.8-.3-1.2 0-.4.1-.9.3-1.2.2-.4.5-.7.9-.9.4-.2.8-.3 1.2-.3.4 0 .9.1 1.2.3.4.2.7.5.9.9.2.3.3.7.3 1.2m-.5 0c0-.5-.2-1-.6-1.4-.4-.4-.9-.6-1.4-.6-.5 0-1 .2-1.4.6-.4.4-.6.9-.6 1.4s.2 1 .6 1.4c.4.4.9.6 1.4.6.5 0 1-.2 1.4-.6.4-.4.6-.9.6-1.4zM123.7 24.3h1.2c.3 0 .6.1.7.2.2.1.2.3.2.5s-.1.3-.2.5c-.1.1-.3.2-.5.3.1 0 .2.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.2.3 0 0 .1.3.4.8h-.8c-.3-.5-.4-.8-.5-.9-.1-.1-.2-.2-.3-.2h-.1v1.1h-.7v-2.7zm.7 1.2h.3c.2 0 .3 0 .4-.1.1-.1.1-.1.1-.2s0-.2-.1-.2c-.1-.1-.2-.1-.4-.1h-.3v.6z\" />\n    </Svg>. I think this is probably fixed now, The parser had an issue which has been fixed some time ago.. Hmm, is https://github.com/godaddy/svgs insufficient?. Sure, sounds like a good idea actually. Would you have any time for this?\nThe main difference would probably be that quite a few things from the spec are still lacking support, compared to the ever-green browsers.\nAlso, the APIs could probably be generated from the WebIDLs, to get the getters, setters and methods exposed as well. Enabling use of the existing unit test suites.. @3rd-Eden What do you think? How much work would it be to integrate svgs into react-native-svg? And make it work seamlessly with react-native-web?. The readme has a small (incomplete) summary at the end https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#todo \nAlso, filters aren't supported (blend, convolutions, offset copies, composites, lighting, blur, shadows etc), the animated element, and animated attributes, color-profiles, css and style elements, 3d transforms, text layout has some bugs, vertical and rtl text isn't properly supported, defining svg fonts, foreign-object (web-view). But most of all, all the DOM interfaces and events are missing. And surely I'm forgetting some things still which people take for granted in the web.. @indexzero Sure, make sense, had some similar thoughts last summer when I started maintaining this and using svgs.\n@necolas What parts of the style props would you need which aren't already supported by some similar part of the svg spec? At least css can be preprocessed and inlined as element attributes as long as the svg only has static styles. Paths, colors and transforms can be changed already, and are inherited by ancestors of G elements, what more do you need for icons?. js\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  root: {\n    display: 'inline-block', // This is default in RN no?\n    fill: 'currentcolor', // If you wrap your content in a G element, you can set fill for all ancestors to inherit it\n    height: '1.25em', // RN doesn't support em in sizing their elements, can use pixels instead (and soon percentages in the root svg element of rnsvg as well)\n    maxWidth: '100%', // RN already support this on the root svg element no?\n    position: 'relative', // This is default for RN right?\n    userSelect: 'none', // Nothing is selectable by default in RN anyway, or?\n    textAlignVertical: 'text-bottom' // (rn)svg supports the alignmentbaseline and vertical align attributes\n  }\n});\nI think your use case can be covered with an already existing subset of the web and react-native(-svg), am I missing something?. I've forked svgs to support react-native-web and published it under the name swgs to see how much interest there is for this\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/swgs\nEssentially the only difference so far is to use \nimport { createElement } from 'react-native-web';\n instead of \nimport React from 'react';\nhttps://github.com/msand/swgs/commit/d5ac0a4e93e6bad3b8ed190c6833adf58361fcfc#diff-168726dbe96b3ce427e7fedce31bb0bcR1\n@necolas Are there any more changes needed on the native side or in swgs at this point?. I have basic currentColor support here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/1827b918833efdaa25cfc1a76df2164cb2bcdd2b. @3rd-Eden Hmm, I'm not sure how to feature detect that. You have any suggestion? I'm happy to make a PR and refer people to svgs if its possible.. Now I have this kind of Icons working cross-platform:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Svg, Path } from 'swgs';\nexport default props => (\n  <Svg\n    title=\"pencil\"\n    x=\"0\"\n    y=\"0\"\n    width=\"20\"\n    height=\"20\"\n    color=\"green\"\n    style={{ margin: 5 }}\n    viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\n    {...props}\n\n<Path\n  fill=\"currentColor\"\n  d=\"M318.37,85.45L422.53,190.11,158.89,455,54.79,350.38ZM501.56,60.2L455.11,13.53a45.93,45.93,0,0,0-65.11,0L345.51,58.24,449.66,162.9l51.9-52.15A35.8,35.8,0,0,0,501.56,60.2ZM0.29,497.49a11.88,11.88,0,0,0,14.34,14.17l116.06-28.28L26.59,378.72Z\"\n/>\n\n\n);\n\n. The width and height attributes also work with percentages, I think the svg logic should also work with em but it would fall back to 12px as the user-agent default so can just as well multiply by 12, and I think RN/Yoga would choke on it anyway. And the fact that View elements don't have font size and that it can't be nested inside of Text elements at the moment, make font-size relative svg bitmap sizes a bit redundant.. I'm not sure if the RN team is interested in adding support for the color attribute to the View element, it should probably stay layout focused. If someone would look at supporting Svg inside Text, then we could look at inheriting the font color as well as font-size relative size. But, as a tradeoff for now, I think having a color attribute on the Svg element gives a nice way to set one color across all the content in a tree, and which is easy to override with a property, and G elements + stroke & fill inheritance can be used for more selective color re-use. . Added support for the fill and stroke attributes on the Svg root element now. Allowing to set a default stroke, and fill, plus a third color attribute, which can be used as currentColor in any color accepting attribute, without having to create a nesting G element.. i've added basic support for the style attribute now. @necolas Do you have any example which isn't working the same in native as in web? Would be great to have some examples of (preferably troublesome but spec conformant) content using RNW styles.. Now with support for setting dimensions using Stylesheet / style attribute.\n![screen shot 2018-10-05 at 3 55 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1131362/46510590-9d7eb380-c852-11e8-9a13-426bfa07caf5.png)jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Path, Rect } from 'swgs';\nconst Pencil = props => (\n  <Svg\n    title=\"pencil\"\n    style={{\n      width: '100%',\n      height: '100%',\n      color: 'green',\n      fill: 'currentColor',\n    }}\n    viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\n    preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"\n    {...props}\n\n<Rect\n  x=\"0\"\n  y=\"0\"\n  width=\"512\"\n  height=\"512\"\n  stroke=\"blue\"\n  fill=\"#E5ECEF\"\n  strokeWidth=\"4\"\n/>\n<Path d=\"M318.37,85.45L422.53,190.11,158.89,455,54.79,350.38Z\n         M501.56,60.2L455.11,13.53a45.93,45.93,0,0,0-65.11,0\n         L345.51,58.24,449.66,162.9l51.9-52.15A35.8,35.8,0,0,0,501.56,60.2Z\n         M0.29,497.49a11.88,11.88,0,0,0,14.34,14.17l116.06-28.28L26.59,378.72Z\"\n/>\n\n\n);\n\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n  },\n  img: {\n    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',\n    borderColor: 'black',\n    borderWidth: 2,\n    height: '50%',\n    width: '50%',\n  },\n});\n```. @necolas Yes, if you happen to know of any content which doesn't work satisfactorily yet.

Well, it's thrown by react-native, so would have to ask them. I'm not sure what would be a more accurate message though.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/5898817fc1a66bd317d65ce96520159df2f96045/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/views/text/ReactBaseTextShadowNode.java#L106.

Please find one for me \ud83d\ude04 . You'll also need to link react-native manually, by adding the projects to libraries in your main project, and to your \"Linked Frameworks and Libraries\" in the Build Phases. Such that you have it linked both manually and using cocoapods, and then add the hack to remove the cocoapods one, such that you're able to archive your project.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/15838#issuecomment-333455341. Great, happy I could help. I managed to get a slightly less hacky version working today. Removed the manually linked version, but then building/running/archiving from XCode breaks. But I found that compiling manually from the cli still works, so I added two npm scripts to package.json\nhttps://github.com/msand/SVGPodTest/commit/5343af586edd31a3547d215f99f893f4e3f88e8d#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R8\n+    \"release\": \"cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace SVGPodTest.xcworkspace -configuration Release -scheme SVGPodTest -destination id=711F49EC-5747-4393-94DB-77B97D466541 -derivedDataPath build\",\n+    \"archive\": \"cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace SVGPodTest.xcworkspace -configuration Release -scheme SVGPodTest -derivedDataPath build  -archivePath ./YourApp.xcarchive archive\"\nIt would be nice to be able to build from XCode as well. Not sure how its possible that it works from the cli but is broken there.. Another approach I found is to remove all the manually linked libraries and let cocoapods link React as well. This doesn't allow starting debug mode from xcode though, but works with run-ios in the cli. If you need to debug the obj-c code, I recommend duplicating the target which you're installing the pods in to, and manually link react there. If you can, I would recommend avoiding cocoapods, as it's just another thing which can break in your system. If npm, react-native link and normal xcode works for you, then just use that. If you need something from outside npm, like with react-native-fbsdk (or want swift code, I think) etc., then you need cocoapods at least.. Has anyone tried removing this line?\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/d5a5e97b38e7f3e5b463fe63d3f7b2a2de1f3f14/RNSVG.podspec#L16\nI'm thinking perhaps it would still build correctly without it, and perhaps resolve the conflicts. I don't have any cocoapods setup to test with easily right now. Could someone here test it?. This is probably related to ligatures, the font probably has a ligature for 'fl' in addition to the normal 'fi' ligature, and it either has the incorrect advance width, or it's not accounted for correctly. On what version is this? And can you post a reproduction rather than a screenshot? . Ah, can you try with the latest version? Pre v6.0.0 doesn't support ligatures. Tried to replicate it but I don't have the specific font available, after setting a proper viewBox and x,y coordinates it seems to work with the system fonts at least: https://snack.expo.io/SyfGuRx3G\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Defs, LinearGradient, Stop, Text, Rect } = Svg;\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    let color1 = this.props.color1 || '#ff00a8';\n    let color2 = this.props.color2 || '#ff000c';\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Hello fla fle fli flo flu\n          \n\n            Hello fla fle fli flo flu\n          \n\n            Hello fla fle fli flo flu\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```\n. Is this still an issue? Can you provide a full replication?. @yangyi @liuqiang1357  Could you provide a small code snippet to demonstrate the issue you had?. Sure, could be done. Would you be willing to make a PR @koswarabilly or are you up for it @matc4 ?. If you only have an image and want onPress, then you can simply use TouchableHighlight and Image from React Native, e.g.  like this: https://snack.expo.io/Bk6Cq9SKG\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, TouchableHighlight, Image } from 'react-native';\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n alert('Do something!')}>\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n  logo: {\n    backgroundColor: '#056ecf',\n    height: 128,\n    width: 128,\n  },\n});\n. That's of course just a temporary workaround, and this issue probably needs more investigation.. Press handling has been improved a lot. Please try with the latest commit from the master branch. Closing until further notice.. Thanks for this! Merged and released new version 6.3.0. Not an issue with this library.. Thanks for this! Merged and released new version 6.3.0. Thanks for this! Merged and released new version 6.3.0. Merged and released patch version.. Works in the master branch at least.. Currently filters aren't supported, thus drop shadows don't work either. I've just used raster shadows as a workaround for now.. It would require implementing the filter attribute, filter element and the filter primitives, or at least feGaussianBlur, feOffset, feMerge and feMergeNode. \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/filters.html#AnExample. Work on filters tracked here: #150 . Can you try with the latest commit in the master branch? It should work with any shapes now.. Can you test with this one? https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/5e1bb859fc281d89feac37dcc3459fcd078e0f91. I think the issue here is that the aspect ratio of your viewbox doesn't match the aspect ratio of the svg element, thus it has to scale it to fit, using xMidYMid meet for the preserveAspectRatio attribute, try setting your width to 106 and height to 56 or a multiple of those values and it'll line up..jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Rect } = Svg;\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```. At least the example from here seems to work correctly: https://github.com/msand/newproject/blob/master/src/components/PreserveAspectRatio.js\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#ExamplePreserveAspectRatio\n\n. Hmm, the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio attributes belong on the Symbol element\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SymbolElement\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#UseElement\n. You can set it on the Symbol no? Inside SvgSymbolFromXml I guess? If you pass it thru. Then the viewBox attribute decides how the coordinates inside the symbol map to the scaled viewport with the width and height dimensions. But I'm not sure why you have the symbol and use element in the first place, and even more strange that you have children for the SvgSymbolFromXml element. I think the best would be to just have a Svg element with width and height set to the size you want in the viewport, and then set viewBox and preserveAspectRatio to suitable values for your content to be scaled. Symbol and Use is only useful if you have more than one Use element referencing the Symbol.. Have you linked it? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/README.md#installation\n\nLink native code\n\nreact-native link react-native-svg. Has anyone found a solution? Or could someone make a minimal replication? . So, this is probably just linking issues, not a problem with the library, closing.... Not related to this library.. Seems to work fine: https://snack.expo.io/By94nj_3z\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, TouchableHighlight, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { toggle: false };\n  toggle = () => this.setState(({ toggle }) => ({ toggle: !toggle }));\n  render() {\n    const { toggle } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0ff',\n  },\n  button: {\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#DDDDDD',\n    padding: 10,\n  },\n});\n```. @slorber @Naeoth  I have an experiment for using TouchableOpacity inside svg content here: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/touchableopacityg no changes needed inside the library..

Mainly the viewBox attribute I guess. It defines the coordinate system used in the svg together with the preserveAspectRatio attribute and meet/slice. The width and height attributes decide how many pixels the actual canvas/bitmap it gets rendered into has, you're setting both, while the viewBox attribute should only depend on the vector data, not the render target.. Hmm, how come it wants to allocate almost 70 megs? What size are you rendering at? I suspect that its bigger than the actual screen, which is redundant, as it shouldn't improve quality noticeably but will require a lot of extra work and resources. . Perhaps try setting it around the list instead of the elements, or render it somehow that you only have one instance (at most screen size) of it instead of several / a big one. . @jfr3000 Good to hear upgrading helped. If you can make a small replication that would be very much appreciated! I've also made quite a significant refactor of the android implementation in the plain-views branch, I wonder if those would affect the situation. Would you mind testing?. Yeah, 7.2.0 is the latest: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg?activeTab=versions. v8 has been released now as well. Closing this as the cause is most likely svg elements which are much bigger than the screen.. Published new version now with all the merged PRs.. @maxkomarychev Thanks for your great work! Would you be interested in joining as a maintainer?. Excellent! @magicismight @dustinsavery @brentvatne @sibelius could one of you add him as a collaborator? Or give me team maintainer rights / add me to the react-native-community org? . Sure, I can take a look perhaps on monday evening and merge the open PRs. I've changed jobs to a startup I cofounded, and I'm not currently working on any react native code base, except some hobby project experiments.  So, we should probably try to find more maintainers for now as well, as I won't have much time for much testing nor further development right now. @dustinsavery @brentvatne Do you have anyone/time available? . Looks good, but is the inverse initial transform really needed on android? We're creating the canvas ourselves, and it should have the identity as the initial transform, no?. Looks good, haven't tested yet though. Also been thinking it would be good to expose https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#InterfaceSVGLocatable\ninterface SVGLocatable {\nreadonly attribute SVGElement nearestViewportElement;\n  readonly attribute SVGElement farthestViewportElement;\nSVGRect getBBox();\n  SVGMatrix getCTM();\n  SVGMatrix getScreenCTM();\n  SVGMatrix getTransformToElement(in SVGElement element) raises(SVGException);\n};\nBut, as this is react-native, perhaps onLayout is sufficient, as e.g. getBBox must return the actual bounding box at the time the method was called, even in case the element has not yet been rendered.\nWill merge and test before releasing.. Hmm, I'm not having this problem, are you sure this is an issue?. Try rebuilding your native bundle.\ncd android\ngradlew clean\ncd ..\nreact-native run-android\n```. Ahaa, then, upgrade expo, and remove the dependency on react-native-svg or sync the version with the expo bundled one, it comes pre-built inside expo and the javascript of it needs to have the same api for the data it sends over the bridge as the native part on the other side of it. Going from v5 to v6 has a breaking change, thus the major semver change.. Upgrade to the latest Expo version, and remove react-native-svg from your dependencies (its comes with batteries included in Expo), instead import it from expo like this:\njs\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nconst {\n  Circle,\n  Ellipse,\n  G,\n  Text,\n  TSpan,\n  TextPath,\n  Path,\n  Polygon,\n  Polyline,\n  Line,\n  Rect,\n  Use,\n  Image,\n  Symbol,\n  Defs,\n  LinearGradient,\n  RadialGradient,\n  Stop,\n  ClipPath,\n  Pattern,\n  Mask,\n} = Svg; . Seems like an issue with an old version in an old expo. Closing.... Are you looking for fill=\"none\" perhaps?. React-Native doesn't implement the DOM api, querySelector(All), createElement, appendChild, removeChild, setAttribute, add/removeEventListener etc. Would require implementing a compatibility layer for that first. You can use a webview, and svg + d3 selections there, but not in the native context as of yet at least.. Take a look at: https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts/. Any interest in this? Otherwise I guess this could be closed.. Linking issue, not a problem with the library.. Docs have been updated: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#use-with-svg-files\nWith react-native-svg-transformer you can now do this:\njsx\nimport Logo from \"./logo.svg\";\nconst myApp = () => <Logo width={120} height={40} />\nexport default myApp. Oh this question was for urls, well, docs have been updated for that as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#use-with-content-loaded-from-uri\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport SvgUri from 'react-native-svg-uri';\nexport default () => (\n  \n);\n. Can you try changing it to transform=\"translate(-313, -602)\"\n?. I think its redundant and just extra overhead since the transform parser was implemented, should work fine without it. . Also, the rotate transform supports optional origin now as in: rotate(angle, x, y) so you can simplify those and remove the two translations per rotation if you feel like ;) . You can use onLayout to get the dimensions, or UIManager.measure. Please feel free to provide a PR to change this. Not sure why this would've changed.. This is certainly a bug, I'm not currently working on any react-native project and won't have any time to investigate now, please feel free to look into it. Perhaps a git bisect on the commit history to identify the commit that causes it, and I (or someone else) might be able to fix it relatively quickly.. The ReadableArray was reporting size 0 for non-empty arrays, I re-wrote it using ArrayList instead, can you try the latest version and see if it's fixed?. Please provide a complete replication, it's not possible to debug the code you posted. . It seems the issue was related to using v6 of rnsvg in Expo, issue non-existent in v7. But could be worked around by simplifying the svg content to a single Path element (and setting a fill on that), removing all G, Rect, and ClipPath elements. Making it perform better (memory, cpu and gpu) and work universally.. Closing this as the issue is fixed.. Can you try with the latest version? I suspect it's something with your android / gradle setup, check here eg: https://github.com/evollu/react-native-fcm/issues/800\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19239\nhttps://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info/issues/365#issuecomment-425662649\nOtherwise, please try to replicate it in a clean project which can be cloned and tested easily.. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. This change has already been made, closing.. Linking issue, not issue with the library.. You can use ColorMatrix to achieve this: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/150#issuecomment-433770734. Please provide a full replication.. You can position the svg absolutely on top of the content, until we have foreignObject support: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/447. This is fixed in at least v8 and v7, probably the latest v6 as well. How about something like this? https://snack.expo.io/@msand/test-dimension-changejsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst smallState = { width: 100, height: 100, small: true };\nconst bigState = { width: 200, height: 200, small: false };\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { width: 100, height: 100, small: true };\nchangeSize = () =>\n    this.setState(({ small }) => (small ? bigState : smallState));\nrender() {\n    const { width, height, small } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. This should be fixed now and works without using key.. @mike-marcacci good catch, the clipping needed to happen before adjusting image coordinates to screen coordinates (apple likes having the y axis inverted), can you try this fix: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/f1f0e2f18612236686f1f2deec13553b09cd9958. React-Native supports zIndex https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/layout-props#zindex try using it either on the root Svg element or wrap that in a View and set it on that. Its something you should probably avoid, and just use the document order if possible.. Is this still an issue with the latest version? In that case, please provide a full replication.. I've added support for animation of transforms using the same syntax as react-native views now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/803#issuecomment-428815111\nAnd also for any number accepting properties. Any help in testing the latest commit in the master branch would be much appreciated!. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. @ericjames Hmm, are you sure you're using the latest version? At least in my current work in progress branch https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757 percentage width and height works in both iOS and Android.. @edoantonioco Try v7.0.0. I think this is fixed in the latest version, otherwise, try the plain-views branch . @BeHotSiii Try with the latest react-native and react-native-svg versions.\nClosing this until a reproduction is made available.. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. Hmm, strings are valid inputs in this case https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/lib/extract/extractOpacity.js#L2\nBut, if it's causing errors I guess it makes sense to change it. Is there any way to remove/override the inherited conflicting type from ViewProps in typescript? But I guess that doesn't make sense, as in that case it can't guarantee that other api:s expecting that type can handle it.. Render both elements (icon and placeholder), add onLayout to the svg element, (add to state and) set hidePlaceholder to true, and only render the icon when this is the case.. Returning false should probably be fine, but would be more interesting to find out why there's no shadow node?. Has anyone tried if the hit testing works correctly with the pr? Even after coming to a screen that is.. . Hit testing is process of walking the tree of nodes, to find the first (topmost) one which intersects the pointer when pressing the screen, i.e. the thing which is broken here. So, if you put a clickhandler on a svg element, does it still respond to touches correctly if you exit and reenter the view? @mtettmar can you test with the newly published 6.5.2?. You could use headless chrome (if you're using svgs) to render a big enough png and transform it to look the same as the vector version will output, alternatively use an emulator and one of the screenshot libs like e.g. https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot this could even be made into a server side raster pre rendering thing with proper caching if needed. . Alternatively the toDataURL base64 output could be used, move the svg offscreen and use something like this in the background before the output is needed and then use a react native image \nhttps://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg-example/blob/master/examples/Svg.js#L163. Could you try doing it in onLayout? I haven't tested toDataUrl for a long time. Merged #729 and published v6.5.0. Can you post a full replication? I've made some changes to the touch handling in the most recent commit, so it might have been fixed with that as well.. I think I've fixed the issue now, please try again with the latest commit from the master branch and e.g. this code:jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Button, Dimensions, StyleSheet, View } from \"react-native\";\nimport Svg, { Polyline } from \"react-native-svg\";\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n {\n              console.log(\"Polyline press on contour or fill?\");\n            }}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\n    backgroundColor: \"beige\",\n  },\n});\n. I've improved touch handling further now, can you test this branch: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/SVGLength. If you want hitSlop, then you can wrap the svg root in a TouchableOpacity or something similar, the onPress handlers inside the svg root require exact match with either the stroke or the fill of something visible.. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. How about something like this? https://snack.expo.io/@msand/test-dimension-changejsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst smallState = { width: 100, height: 100, small: true };\nconst bigState = { width: 200, height: 200, small: false };\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { width: 100, height: 100, small: true };\nchangeSize = () =>\n    this.setState(({ small }) => (small ? bigState : smallState));\nrender() {\n    const { width, height, small } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. Or, actually, for animation, something more like this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/zoomablesvg-v3-animated-width-example. Changing width and height works correctly now. Closing.. Well, there no official support from any company or person, what would you consider official in this case? This is just a community of devs scratching their own itches. Please feel free to attempt fixing the issue you're experiencing. I haven't seen any pr to fix this as of yet, nor do i have any solution readily available. I'm not sure if the proposed fix actually solves the underlying issue, have you tried it? . I have a hypothesis for the underlying reason here, which is caching of the width/height values. If correct, then a clearing of the cache and invalidation of the tree would fix the issue, without requiring a complete reconstruction of the nodes using the change of key. Alternatively just removing the caching as the performance impact hasn't even been properly validated using measurements, might not even be a measurable difference.\nCould someone try commenting out these lines:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/VirtualNode.java#L309-L311\nand these lines: \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/VirtualNode.java#L323-L325\nto see if this is sufficient to eliminate the symptoms?. I've found that wrapping the text in a TSpan and setting the x and y values on that instead of on the Text element seems to workaround this issue properly. Not sure why it doesn't work on Text correctly yet. But just for reference, this works:jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Button } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Circle, Text, TSpan } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { s: 400 };\n  render() {\n    const { s } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n                HOGWARTS\n              \n\n\n\n {\n            this.setState({ s: s === 400 ? 200 : 400 });\n          }}\n        />\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',\n  },\n});\n```. Or, even better, use SVG as it's meant to, and set a viewBox attribute to define your coordinate space, and define resolution independent vector data, as in e.g.\njsx\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { s: 400 };\n  render() {\n    const { s } = this.state;\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <View style={{ borderWidth: 2 }}>\n          <Svg width={s} height={s} viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n            <Circle\n              cx=\"50\"\n              cy=\"50\"\n              r=\"40\"\n              stroke=\"red\"\n              fillOpacity=\"0\"\n            />\n            <Text\n              textAnchor=\"middle\"\n              fontWeight=\"bold\"\n              fontSize=\"4\"\n              fill=\"black\"\n            >\n              <TSpan x=\"50\" y=\"50\">\n                HOGWARTS\n              </TSpan>\n            </Text>\n          </Svg>\n        </View>\n        <Button\n          title=\"test\"\n          onPress={() => {\n            this.setState({ s: s === 400 ? 200 : 400 });\n          }}\n        />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\nThis way the content wouldn't event need any diffing, except for the width and height attribute.. @msageryd Can you try using msand/react-native-svg#ce602c1 ? At least the tspan version seems to work in iOS with that one.. Another option might be to make the key for the text include the values of (specifically) the problematic dynamic parameters, so it only reconstructs the node if any of the relevant props change and doesn't have any non-determinism causing re-renders without actual changes.. You need to rebuild the native code as well, restarting the packager isn't enough. Can you rebuild and try again?. Either that, or react-native run-ios. Can you try running this code in it? At least this should be working:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Button } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Circle, Text, TSpan } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { s: 400 };\n  render() {\n    const { s } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n                HOGWARTS\n              \n\n\n\n {\n            this.setState({ s: s === 400 ? 200 : 400 });\n          }}\n        />\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',\n  },\n});\nI guess this just means you're experiencing some other issue than this specific thing.. @msageryd Great, that would be very helpful in analysing this further \ud83d\udc4d  . I think I might have a fix available for iOS here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/d0a9cbaceb71d29d55d8e0f675d7d1608cb99ad2 could you test it and see that it doesn't break any other expectations for you?. Same fix for android https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/8e0420fc2d2f5ab58f967a28c03b1dd75bdc5f6e. @jgranstrom @msageryd I have a fix available here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/926bb71a34ffd251d611e38fbe0029f4e4ff8075\nCan you please test it and see if it fixes your issues?\n`yarn add react-native-svg@msand/react-native-svg#926bb71`\n`npm i react-native-svg@msand/react-native-svg#926bb71`. Went through all properties on all element types and fixed the same issue here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/c0f51d81a896d4aee95fac9db6cf3d7180746499\nI assume this has been the root to all kinds of staleness issues.. @msageryd  Oj gl\u00f6mde svara h\u00e4r. Vars\u00e5god, kul att underliggande orsakerna hittades o kunde \u00e5tg\u00e4rdas \ud83d\ude03 \n@jgranstrom The fixes have been published under the 7th major version.\nIf anyone of you have experienced issues with the gesture responder system, then I would recommend testing the latest commit from the master branch, as I've fixed several issues there recently and help in testing would be very useful! Now onPress/In/out should work and be called the correct number of times with the correct hit target.. Gesture and press handling has been further improved in the master branch, and the updating of text seems to work correctly. So I'll close this now.. I'm not actually sure if this is the actual culprit for the error, if not, then there are probably other remaining problems hiding somewhere, would be good to bisect the version history and find what commit and specific change introduced the issues and make a proper fix, anyone willing to work on verifying the fix? Or just prefer having this merged asap?. Well, the spec https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/painting.html#FillProperties says that the default fill is black and the opacity is 1 so this seems like it'll probably break expectations. Do you have some minimal test available which behaves differently from how e.g. browsers would render it?. Can you try the latest version? I think I've fixed the real issue. WritableArray was reporting zero for non-empty arrays, when merging properties from ancestors more than one descendant deep in the tree. Rewrote it using ArrayList<String> instead.. As no new information has arrived I'll assume this has been fixed. Closing.. You can also use react-native style transforms to do animated rotations. Closing now.. Can you try this fix? (for iOS) https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a\n. I think I have (gesture) interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. @flogy Please open another issue for android with a full reproduction. This is probably resolved now. Comment or reopen otherwise.. @akepecs can you provide a repro? Either expo or something that can be cloned and run as is. The rotation attribute isn't standard, the transform attribute has the rotation transform, which ends up affecting the transform matrix which is sent over the native bridge, but the matrices aren't currently animatable, except by normal state transitions, or using setNativeProp with matrices. Animating these would require refactoring to use the react-native matrices and style property handling, or some changes to react-native. As a workaround, you can wrap the parts you want to animate in separate View wrapped Svg components, (and if need be, a foreground and background Svg component), layer and position them appropriately, and, animate these using the plain react-native Animated api with View styles and transforms.. I've added support for animation of transforms using the same syntax as react-native views now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/803#issuecomment-428815111\nAnd also for any number accepting properties, please try again.. Seems unrelated to this library.. I would recommend using the standard transform attribute with the translate transform definition https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Transformations#Translation \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute\ninstead of the non-standard x and y attributes. As in:jsx\nconst translate = [160, 80];\n\ntranslate(${translate[0]},${translate[1]}}>\n    { dots }\n  \n\n```. Could you make a minimal reproduction of it? Otherwise it's a bit hard to investigate. I would recommend debugging and checking here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanShadowNode.java#L265. Can you try in a plain react-native project, with this PR https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/723\n. Merged and published v6.4.1. Can't understand/interpret this. Please elaborate if you want help.. I would prefer not importing from internals, only from the main exports, but guess we can merge this for now.. Well, it's not really done, and I'm unable to know what is correct behavior as I cant read them. If you know any of these languages then please help fixing this. . @SaeedZhiany Yeah, the file has changed, it's now a view instead of a shadow node: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanView.java\nHave you tried running using the commit in this branch?\nyarn add react-native-svg@react-native-community/react-native-svg#bf230c4. If someone is willing to work on this, it probably makes sense to look at how react-native handles this, and just doing the same.. I think it was mostly from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/script-development/arabic. Afaik, it's not working correctly and probably requires quite a bit of work still and I don't have any time to dedicate to it at the moment. Could you work on it? @amerllica . Closing because of inactivity.. You can use fetch to download resources, and use setState to change what is rendered when.. v6.5.0 published @ExoMemphiz . Looking into this today. v6.5.0 published @LinusU @RodolfoSilva @GertjanReynaert @rghorbani . v6.5.0 and up resolved this. Will close this now.. I think it should apply within one Svg root, should be straightforward to test ;). Would prefer not to introduce any global state and ids. Otherwise would need to set up subscriptions for updates or invalidations there as well. You could use the context api to provide a component which contains your Defs, and include this in your Svg components. Or, if the defs are static, just export them from a separate file and then import and compose into any component where you need it.. Merged #729 and published v6.5.0. Have you tried using onLayout and something like this? http://bl.ocks.org/nitaku/8745933/8660a5f46547c04afc2362788910773c56c16642. You can use UIManager.measure or onLayout, closing.. Please provide a full replication.. v6.5.0 published @baconz . v6.5.0 published @yeomann . I have a fix available, could you test it? https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/11a57526fc9f226733dc374e16e22012ed0791aa. Merged #729 and published v6.5.0. Published v6.5.0 @NastuzziSamy . Looking into this today. v6.5.0 published @kenwheeler @boygirl . It requires upgrading gradle, there's an open pr to revert that change, I'll probably merge and release a patch version today. Can you try again with 6.5.1?. This makes no sense. yarn is completely unrelated. There's no such thing as SVG color, and there are no css selectors in react-native.. The latest version should be working fine with the latest react-native version. Or at least, running react-native init, npm i react-native-svg, and, react-native link, should work with minimal fuzz; to be as newcomer friendly as possible. \nThe version incompatibilities are only related to breaking changes in react-native, if you get it to build, then it is probably working to its full extent. Please feel free to try linking and building any pair of versions you need, and otherwise attempt to use the latest of both.\nThere hasn't been many major breaking changes since 0.50 with regards to the apis used by react-native-svg, so no new entries have been added to the version (in)compatibility table.. Also, in general, with react-native, it's recommended to use the version of react defined as a peer dependency by react-native. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html#1-upgrade-the-react-native-dependency\nSometimes a newer patch version can be used, or even changes in minor version. But, you will have to consider that none of the tests have been run for those version pairs, and unexpected behaviour is to be expected.. Seems like a linking issue. Hard to give any suggestions with the current amount of information, as I haven't seen/resolved the issue myself, and am not even using cocoapods for anything atm. Could you make a minimal reproduction? Start with initialising a new react-native project and git repository, configure cocoapods, make sure everything works, commit. Add react-native-svg and firebase as dependencies, check if it still fails. Then commit, push to some public git repo and report back with a link to the git repo.. This is probably an issue with react-native & cocoapods, not this library. Closing.... These are issues with react-native link, please post them in the RN repo.. @ThakurKarthik At least it's working fine both locally, and in TravisCI with the latest versions: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-e2e/blob/master/.travis.yml\nhttps://travis-ci.org/msand/react-native-svg-e2e/builds/504814136\nhttps://app.bitrise.io/build/1cf98115859f41bf. @paulbx81  Feel free to work on this.. Well alright, but it seems unlikely to get worked on before a complete rewrite to a cross-platform rendering backend. . Thanks for the easy replication! Apparently, the handling of multiple child ancestors in the ClipPath was not spec conformant. I've fixed the issues in my latest PR https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/a1097b85942c559ebcef6b93fa2ce601434d9c50 and made the following code behave the same in android and ios as in the latest version of chrome on desktop.\nThe issue was that the paths were merged into a single one, and then the painters algorithm used the non-zero winding rule to decide the geometry of clip path. While the correct way is to take the union of the elements instead.\njsx\n        <Svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n          <Defs>\n            <ClipPath id=\"windowClip\">\n              <G>\n                <Rect x={30} y={50} height={100} width={100} />\n                <Text x={30} y={70} fontSize={40}>\n                  Hello world\n                </Text>\n                <Rect x={30} y={200} height={100} width={100} />\n                <Rect\n                  x={100}\n                  y={250}\n                  height={100}\n                  width={100}\n                />\n                <Rect x={30} y={370} height={100} width={100} />\n                <Polygon\n                  transform=\"translate(70,400)\"\n                  points=\"0,0 0,100 100,120 120,0\"\n                />\n              </G>\n            </ClipPath>\n          </Defs>\n          <Rect\n            height=\"100%\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n            fill=\"#0af\"\n            clipPath=\"url(#windowClip)\"\n            clipRule=\"evenodd\"\n          />\n        </Svg>\nI would refer to the spec for understand how it should work: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/masking.html#EstablishingANewClippingPath\nThe raw geometry of each child element exclusive of rendering properties such as \u2018fill\u2019, \u2018stroke\u2019, \u2018stroke-width\u2019 within a \u2018clipPath\u2019 conceptually defines a 1-bit mask (with the possible exception of anti-aliasing along the edge of the geometry) which represents the silhouette of the graphics associated with that element. Anything outside the outline of the object is masked out. If a child element is made invisible by \u2018display\u2019 or \u2018visibility\u2019 it does not contribute to the clipping path. When the \u2018clipPath\u2019 element contains multiple child elements, the silhouettes of the child elements are logically OR'd together to create a single silhouette which is then used to restrict the region onto which paint can be applied. Thus, a point is inside the clipping path if it is inside any of the children of the \u2018clipPath\u2019.\nFor a given graphics element, the actual clipping path used will be the intersection of the clipping path specified by its \u2018clip-path\u2019 property (if any) with any clipping paths on its ancestors, as specified by the \u2018clip-path\u2019 property on the ancestor elements, or by the \u2018overflow\u2019 property on ancestor elements which establish a new viewport. Also, see the discussion of the initial clipping path.). I haven't properly evaluated https://github.com/target/react-native-svg-parser and https://github.com/vault-development/react-native-svg-uri\nOne of these could possibly be integrated.\nIdeally it would be a babel plugin, allowing to import svg files, converting them to use react and react-native-svg, and allowing it be chained with e.g. https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-inline-elements.html and https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-constant-elements/\nSuch that the parsing and conversion can be done only once at buildtime, or alternatively, some runtime cache could be used for it. But, at least, the static nature of svg files should be optimised for.\nAt the moment, a script to convert .svg to .js/.jsx and importing that is probably the best performing way achieve this. Like this approach: https://github.com/SM-Wistful/react-native-svg\nSo, if someone could write a babel-plugin, then I would fully endorse that approach at least. These existing ones would probably make sense to document as workarounds for now as well.. But then again, keeping this functionality separate from the main rendering logic probably still makes sense. Some people won't need the svg dom parsing, hence its (imho) better to keep the core rendering logic module as small as possible.. Well, for loading svg from url you'll need the parser available at runtime, so then your requirements demand to bundle it, but otherwise it would be unused code included into every project which depends on the renderer.. Found another option: https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr\nHas node api: https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr/tree/master/packages/core\nalso cli, webpack loader, rollup plugin, and a web gui: https://svgr.now.sh/\nbut no babel plugin what I can find. https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg/blob/master/src/index.js has most of the necessary logic, porting the logic (from svgr) for the differences between web svg and react-native-svg to the babel-plugin-inline-react-svg  or making a babel version of svgr would give a complete solution.\n@neoziro @ljharb Has either one of you planned anything like this?. @neoziro Actually, svgo has the _optimizeOnce method, it takes a callback but in reality is synchronous and gets called before optimizeonce returns. . I'm thinking that just taking the fastest possible xml parser, and doing the smallest possible transformation on it, would be ideal. At least for the loading of svg from uri and rendering on demand, if that is to be included in the main react-native-svg package.\nA babel plugin for making react components from .svg files using the import syntax can have any amount of transforms on top configured with babelrc etc, and any optimisers implemented there could be used as middleware on top of normal fetch requests for svg files, if people have some special tradeoffs to take into account. \nBut at least to be spec conformant, referencing svg files using uris in the normal svg syntax shouldn't apply any special transforms. And probably should optimise for parsing performance and code bundle size. Or what do you think?\nBtw, you can always fork svgo and just make that method public, or lock down the peer dependency version. And as you can see, the optimize method mostly just handles the multipass logic by calling _optimizeOnce repeatedly: https://github.com/svg/svgo/blob/62f67dee297430869e41f5649996699c44c68e5f/lib/svgo.js#L24-L72\nRefactoring that to be completely synchronous and return the value straight wouldn't be much work.\nOr are there some other benefits to using unified I'm unaware of?\nAlternatively could request that svgo make the method \"public\" and supported. Essentially just removing the underscore from the beginning of the name. But I consider it a public method already, in javascript, private methods are hidden by closures, using weakmaps, or using the new private method syntax (# character).\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-methods\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields\nHaving an underscore as the first character of the name affects nothing but the name. . @neoziro How is progress / your current thinking on this?. @neoziro I've added docs for using svg files now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#use-with-svg-files\n.babelrc\njson\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"babel-plugin-inline-import\", {\n      \"extensions\": [\n        \".svg\"\n      ]\n    }]\n  ]\n}\nApp.js\njsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport SvgUri from 'react-native-svg-uri';\nimport testSvg from './test.svg';\nexport default () => (\n  <SvgUri\n    width=\"200\"\n    height=\"200\"\n    svgXmlData={testSvg}\n  />\n);\nCan svgr be given the .svg content, and output a function, rather than source code?\nEither way, a babel plugin to do it only in development / at compile-time when the source changes, rather than every render or each startup at runtime, would be needed for proper performance. Or, at the very least caching it by filename/uri.. @neoziro Seems like @kristerkari has done the work for us \u2764\ufe0f https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer \nhttps://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-example/blob/master/rn-cli.config.js. https://medium.com/@prathik_63905/using-svg-in-latest-react-native-version-0-57-e04aa8ea7dd8. Updated docs: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/README.md#use-with-svg-files. @brentvatne @ide Would it be possible to get react-native-svg-transform into Snack? Such that one could import an .svg file and use it as a component? \nhttps://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer#step-3-configure-the-react-native-packager\njsx\nimport Logo from \"./logo.svg\"\nconst MyApp = () => <Logo width={120} height={40} />\nexport default MyApp. I guess this issue could probably be closed at this point, as both remote and local svg files can be handled in multiple ways now.. Optimally, someone would implement support for animating string props in react-native using the native animated driver, I started work on it but not currently putting any time/effort into it, that should allow speeding up lots of animations with the flip of a switch.\nBut in this case, it seems from the gif that the same effect could be achieved using a static chart and a react-native animated view with white background, which starts out covering the entire chart and slides out to the right.\nThis way, it only needs to render the svg once, and then animate the x position of a white rectangle view using native animation and the simplest possible logic; which should be able to achieve 60fps easily, if it is at all possible to get 60fps using react-native with the specific hardware and operating environment in question.. I've done some more work on native animation: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757\nAny help in testing would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude04 . I'm not exactly sure what the tradeoffs here are. This code has been there since v1.1.2 https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/d700ca549304c59e164fe459a9b071b365339ed8\nHave you noticed any performance impact? Perhaps this should be given a boolean prop, set to false/off by default, to give control to the developer. In case it would slow down rendering where shadows aren't needed. What do you think?. I'm thinking I would merge this, and then perhaps https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757 as well. Would you be willing to help test/review that one as well? It extends the share of animatable properties quite a bit, as it supports string interpolation but requires the pr to react-native, or building it yourself if you're on android, testing the fork in iOS should work with relative ease.. I've added support for animation of transforms using the same syntax as react-native views now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/803#issuecomment-428815111\nAnd also for any number accepting properties. Any help in testing the latest commit in the master branch would be much appreciated!. Typo. Unrelated to this repo, please ask on stackoverflow or something.. @stowball has mentioned using some native module for android https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/753#issuecomment-413825722 Is that available somewhere? Perhaps that could be combined with Macaw or something similar.\nI was looking into doing the same about a year ago but decided to improve the spec conformance of this library instead. But, it might still be worth it to have more than one approach available as an option. \nYou might want to look at these:\nhttps://github.com/frostney/react-native-create-library\nhttps://github.com/peggyrayzis/react-native-create-bridge\nhttps://blog.botreetechnologies.com/how-to-build-a-react-native-android-bridge-4166e114a990\nhttps://blog.pixielabs.io/react-native-bridge-modules-for-ios-be0f4cec0435\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/communication-ios\nhttps://hackernoon.com/first-experiences-with-react-native-bridging-an-ios-native-module-for-app-authentication-7a20b7180fc9\nhttps://shellmonger.com/2018/01/19/creating-a-react-native-bridge-library/. Thanks for the helpful reproduction. I think I might have found a solution. Can you try this patch? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/d0a9cbaceb71d29d55d8e0f675d7d1608cb99ad2\n@msageryd I think this might interest you as well.. Same fix for android https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757/commits/8e0420fc2d2f5ab58f967a28c03b1dd75bdc5f6e. It's part of this PR https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/757\nIt's in my fork in the NativeAnimationExperiment branch. As I haven't merged the PR it's not visible in any branch of this repo yet. Good to know it works! \ud83d\udc4d . I've release the fixes, latest version now is v7.0.1 \nThis can probably closed now.. You need to upgrade to RN 0.56 https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/22bdfa930e31ce51f0ed76c1fa1c85a344becbe6 The Play store won't accept older sdk versions anymore. Although, actually, the main thing with this error message is that you need to upgrade gradle. It should be enough to open the project in android studio, and then it should ask you to upgrade with a single click of a button.. Using plain js and react context you can implement this without any changes to react-native-svg. And I would prefer not to introduce context unless the situation really calls for it. It would be nice to have support for currentColor as per spec though. View doesn't support color, and I think Android didn't support rendering images/bitmaps/svg inside text elements (at least using react-native). At least color emoji is possible to render inside text in native Android, so it should be possible to get it working. But it might require a pull request to react-native as well, and I remember reading some discussions about dropping support for Images inside Text on iOS as well. But, getting native support for this would be nice indeed.. I think we could support the color attribute on the svg root element in circumstances like this:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Svg, Path } from 'swgs';\nexport default props => (\n  <Svg\n    title=\"pencil\"\n    x=\"0\"\n    y=\"0\"\n    width=\"20\"\n    height=\"20\"\n    color=\"white\"\n    style={{ margin: 5 }}\n    viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\n    {...props}\n\n<Path\n  fill=\"currentColor\"\n  d=\"M318.37,85.45L422.53,190.11,158.89,455,54.79,350.38ZM501.56,60.2L455.11,13.53a45.93,45.93,0,0,0-65.11,0L345.51,58.24,449.66,162.9l51.9-52.15A35.8,35.8,0,0,0,501.56,60.2ZM0.29,497.49a11.88,11.88,0,0,0,14.34,14.17l116.06-28.28L26.59,378.72Z\"\n/>\n\n\n);\nThis would allow overriding the color if needed. I have partial support here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/1827b918833efdaa25cfc1a76df2164cb2bcdd2b. Closing this for now, as inheritance seems to be working and color is supported. I guess this is resolved then? If you find a nice place / set of conditions to put that logic then it would be great if you could open a pull request. Closing this for now.. @adam-s this is probably a bug in fresco actually, the default settings for a ImageRequest allow even fetching, and only if we have it in bitmap cache do we have a fast path. Thejava\nImageRequestBuilder.newBuilderWithSource(imageSource.getUri()).build();\ncausesjava\n  private RequestLevel mLowestPermittedRequestLevel = RequestLevel.FULL_FETCH;\n```\nto be used.\n\nhttps://frescolib.org/docs/image-requests.html\nLowest Permitted Request Level\nThe image pipeline follows a definite sequence in where it looks for the image.\n\nCheck the bitmap cache. This is nearly instant. If found, return.\nCheck the encoded memory cache. If found, decode the image and return.\nCheck the \u201cdisk\u201d (local storage) cache. If found, load from disk, decode, and return.\nGo to the original file on network or local file. Download, resize and/or rotate if requested, decode, and return. For network images in particular, this will be the slowest by a long shot.\n\nThe setLowestPermittedRequestLevel field lets you control how far down this list the pipeline will go. Possible values are:\n\nBITMAP_MEMORY_CACHE\nENCODED_MEMORY_CACHE\nDISK_CACHE\nFULL_FETCH\n\nThis is useful in situations where you need an instant, or at least relatively fast, image or none at all.. If you need a quick fix then you can just remove the second argument: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg/commit/a1097b85942c559ebcef6b93fa2ce601434d9c50#diff-633cc935907e7685222b28cf9a0d7696L268\nThat's more spec conformant anyway.. It seems your svg only contains a base64 encoded png. I would recommend just using a binary encoded .png file with the normal Image component form React-Native. Additionally, it seems your base64 encoded string has some problems, it contains 113 occurrences of the string \"undefined\" and seems corrupted.. Seems to work fine on ios for me. Can you please provide a full reproduction? Or verify that it works with the latest versions of react-native and react-native-svg? Closing for now.. Well, as no one receives monetary compensation for working on this repo, I'm not sure if it's possible to make any conclusions from inactivity on one specific issue. Except perhaps that others probably aren't experiencing the same issue. I suspect the library has a significant amount of use, at least from looking at how many repos on github depend on it, and the number of monthly downloads.\nIn general, the way to be a good open source citizen is to attempt to solve ones own issues and share the solution with others, or at least describe what troubleshooting has already been done.\nIn this case, it seems Android only supports referring to a Path element in the TextPath href attribute. If you replace the Line with a Path with d=\"M100,100 L300,300\" it should work also in Expo\njsx\n  <Svg width={500} height={500}>\n    <Defs>\n      <Path id=\"line\" d=\"M100,100 L300,300\" stroke=\"red\" strokeWidth=\"2\" />\n    </Defs>\n    <Use href=\"#line\" fill=\"blue\" />\n    <Text fill=\"blue\" fontSize=\"20\" x=\"0\">\n      <TextPath href=\"#line\">Some random text</TextPath>\n    </Text>\n  </Svg>\nOr, you can use plain react-native / eject from expo, and use the latest commit here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/35597ed7720ef01abe1c111e22308468e605cf01. @vjsingh Try removing the stroke and setting the fill instead:\njsx\n            <Svg.Text\n              fill=\"blue\"\n              fontSize={56}\n              fontWeight=\"100\"\n              textAnchor=\"middle\"\n              x=\"50%\"\n              y=\"50\">\n              lazy dog\n            </Svg.Text>. Cat on your keyboard? \ud83d\ude04 . Have you tried wrapping the Svg root with the consumer instead? I think that should work fine at least.. I think this should be possible since https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/679 was merged.. Is it causing any issues?\nIf you really want to get rid of it, then you can refactor the code to use the inversion of control pattern as I've described for a similar issue two years ago: https://esdiscuss.org/topic/how-to-solve-this-basic-es6-module-circular-dependency-problem#content-39\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/44226565\nAnd open a pr with the changes. . I've merged https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/813 to master now, you can either use the latest commit from the master branch, or wait until the next release and use that.. Published fix in v8. I think this breaks handling of text no? Should use inversion of control instead to inject the tspan reference. The cycle shouldn't even be an issue as it is. Or? . Closing in favor of https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/813. Try:\nreact-native unlink react-native-svg \nand then:\nreact-native link react-native-svg. @phosphene I would love to have any kind of testing available, your contributions would be more than welcome! \u2764\ufe0fIdeally we would run tests with most of the files from https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/svg on each commit. A bit more info:\nhttps://github.com/w3c/svgwg/wiki/Testing . @phosphene Any progress on this?. Alright, no worries. Anyway, would be great to get some regression tests, and perhaps even compare against the reference images used by firefox and chrome etc. If anyone is interested, already investigating other react-native modules how they do testing of their iOS and Android native code and documenting it here would be great. Then there would be a clear path forwards as soon as someone has time to look at this.\nI guess the expo and react-native codebases might be the main ones to look at. But, at least hopefully, someone knows about some well tested native module and can suggest/link to it here. Ideally something showing a ci setup running unit, integration and acceptance tests for native code in both android and ios. And if someone knows about a provider who gives this for free to open-source projects, that would certainly simplify things, alternatively perhaps someone could sponsor it? I would assume this library has provided its fair share of value to various native app stakeholders. I wonder what it would take to get them to provide even a bit monetary compensation for more stability and reliability in a relatively critical component. Especially when it would go straight to running costs of providing automated testing.. I tried setting up some end-to-end tests here in case you're interested: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-e2e. Having a bit of trouble getting e2e test to work on android in travis-ci and bitrise. Works fine locally on both android and ios. And, now I think I found a workaround for travis at least: https://travis-ci.org/msand/react-native-svg-e2e/builds/501950972\nBut haven't got android tests to work on bitrise a single time yet. Also opened an issue in the detox repo: https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/1194. Managed to get x86 and x86_64 android images running on travis using the latest android emulator canary, which now works in headless mode without hardware acceleration / kvm support: https://travis-ci.org/msand/test_emulators/builds/502382369. Got android working on bitrise now as well: https://app.bitrise.io/build/c31c1a40907cd137. This should already be fixed in v7.0.1 no?. @ebrugulec \ud83d\ude32 My mistake. Thanks for the issue report! I've fixed the issue and published v7.0.1 please install that version and try again \u2764\ufe0f . Thanks for the issue report! Fixed in v7.0.2. In the case of https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/273#issuecomment-421862836 I think its some missing attributes causing exceptions making the view hierarchy fail. Should probably add some default values to be sent from js to native.\nCould you post a full reproduction? or at least the component causing the exception?. Hmm. Seems to work fine here, are you giving it a width and height prop? As in e.g. \njsx\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Background width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" />\n      </View>\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  LinearGradient,\n  ClipPath,\n  Defs,\n  Path,\n  Stop,\n  Svg,\n  G,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nconst Background = props => (\n  <Svg\n    xmlnsXlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"\n    viewBox=\"0 5 375 162\"\n    {...props}\n\n<Defs>\n  <ClipPath id=\"c\">\n    <Path data-name=\"Rectangle 39\" fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h375v162H0z\" />\n  </ClipPath>\n  <LinearGradient\n    id=\"d\"\n    x1={0.5}\n    x2={0.5}\n    y2={1}\n    gradientUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\"\n\n    <Stop offset=\"0\" stopColor=\"#fff\" />\n    <Stop offset=\"1\" stopColor=\"#fff\" stopOpacity={0.898} />\n  </LinearGradient>\n  <LinearGradient\n    id=\"a\"\n    x1={0.5}\n    x2={0.5}\n    y2={1}\n    gradientUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\"\n\n    <Stop offset=\"0\" stopColor=\"#007aff\" />\n    <Stop offset=\"1\" stopColor=\"#007aff\" />\n  </LinearGradient>\n  <LinearGradient\n    id=\"e\"\n    x1={1}\n    y1={0.423}\n    x2={0.176}\n    y2={0.423}\n    xlinkHref=\"#a\"\n\n    <Stop offset=\"0\" stopColor=\"#007aff\" />\n    <Stop offset=\"1\" stopColor=\"#007aff\" />\n  </LinearGradient>\n  <LinearGradient id=\"f\" x1={1} y1={0.381} x2={0} y2={0.381} xlinkHref=\"#a\">\n    <Stop offset=\"0\" stopColor=\"#007aff\" />\n    <Stop offset=\"1\" stopColor=\"#007aff\" />\n  </LinearGradient>\n  <ClipPath id=\"b\">\n    <Path d=\"M0 0h375v162H0z\" fill=\"none\" />\n  </ClipPath>\n</Defs>\n<G clipPath=\"url(#b)\">\n  <G data-name=\"Group 193\" clipPath=\"url(#c)\">\n    <Path\n      data-name=\"Path 133\"\n      d=\"M0 0h375v124.5l-223.742-.157-11.446-.632s-6.2-.47-12.425-1.1-12.29-1.434-12.29-1.434l-10.74-1.594-8.452 2.25-11.572 2.656-15.35 2.879-20.089 2.564-17.714 1.121-17.329-.282-13.857-1.631z\"\n      transform=\"translate(-1)\"\n      opacity={0.996}\n      fill=\"url(#d)\"\n    />\n    <Path\n      data-name=\"Path 134\"\n      d=\"M610.553 387.468s-62-12.831-159.372 29.249-218.117-21.969-218.117-21.969V757.24h375.492z\"\n      transform=\"rotate(180 304.776 258.389)\"\n      fill=\"url(#a)\"\n      opacity={0.4}\n    />\n    <Path\n      data-name=\"Path 135\"\n      d=\"M608.556 447.414s-103.73-50.322-217.3-30.706-158.188-41.954-158.188-41.954v402.462h375.488z\"\n      transform=\"rotate(180 304.276 268.377)\"\n      opacity={0.15}\n      fill=\"url(#a)\"\n    />\n    <Path\n      data-name=\"Path 136\"\n      d=\"M158.465 404.4s65.859-46.648 198.272-8.8 253.7 24.38 253.7 24.38l-1 335.8H233.911z\"\n      transform=\"rotate(180 305.233 257.388)\"\n      fill=\"url(#e)\"\n      opacity={0.7}\n    />\n    <Path\n      data-name=\"Path 137\"\n      d=\"M214 428.833s58.188-43.083 190.26-5.175S590.553 460 590.553 460l-1 326.378H213z\"\n      transform=\"rotate(180 294.776 272.691)\"\n      fill=\"url(#f)\"\n      opacity={0.7}\n    />\n  </G>\n</G>\n\n\n);\n\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. @gbrlcustodio  I only tested in the emulator so far, can you get it to work there at least?\n@kristerkari @alimek  Please post a reproduction of the error or make your project available on github.. Can you try with the latest commit from the master branch? At least it seems to work fine there.. A bit of the property update process has changed, and the error should probably be a warning instead, as in most cases it's because a new element has been created, and the new properties have been set on it, but it hasn't been attached to the svg render tree yet. At this point, the onAfterUpdateTransaction of the RenderableViewManager attempts to invalidate the svg root, but cannot find it, as the element isn't a descendant yet. I haven't been able to make it crash in combination with this error message yet, any help in how to trigger it would be useful.. Ok, should perhaps just remove the error message, as in a lot (most) cases its expected behavior. Or make it discern this case and not even make the call. . @kristerkari I changed the null handling logic, so the common initial case doesn't cause any warnings: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/a2550c35df7cdf972ba707687480c7b4573c9b32. Closing this as it's fixed in the latest versions.. True, could you try implementing it? . @Rowandjj Any progress on this?. Can you try with the latest commit from the master branch and this code instead:\nI've removed the onResponderGrant/Release/Reject/Terminate handler, not to override the ones from the SvgTouchableMixin, it seems to give all the events, both on first and second view now.jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\nimport {createBottomTabNavigator} from 'react-navigation'\nconst { width } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst FirstTab = () => (\n  First Tab\n)\nconst SecondTab = () => (\n${width}}\n    height={${width}}\n    viewBox=\"-200 -200 400 400\"\n    style={{ backgroundColor: '#fff' }}\n    onTouchStart={() => console.log('touchStart')}\n    onTouchEnd={() => console.log('touchEnd')}\n    onTouchMove={() => console.log('onTouchMove')}>\n     console.log('onPressIn')}\n      onPress={() => console.log('onPress')}\n      onPressOut={() => console.log('onPressOut')}\n      onResponderEnd={() => console.log('onResponderEnd')}\n      onResponderStart={() => console.log('onResponderStart')}\n      stroke=\"black\"\n      strokeWidth=\"5\"\n      r=\"40\"\n      fill={'#fff'}\n    />\n  \n)\nconst tabNavigator = createBottomTabNavigator({\n  FirstTab,\n  SecondTab\n})\nexport default tabNavigator;\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. @tovesson can you provide a full replication? I get the feeling that shouldn't be possible in 8.0.1 are you sure you rebuilt the native code successfully? . Try v8.0.3. @tufik2 Seems you have some caching issues. Try\nwatchman watch-del-all\nrm -fr $TMPDIR/react-*\nnpm start -- --reset-cache\nOr,\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm i\nnpm start -- --reset-cache\n```. @NirpE Can you try replacing this line https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/SvgView.java#L100\nWith something like:\njava\n            SvgViewShadowNode node = getShadowNode();\n            if (node == null) {\n                return;\n            }\n            mBitmap = node.drawOutput();. Fix has been published, upgrade to latest version.. Can you try with v8.0.8?. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. The Mask element was introduced in v7 and Expo still uses 6.2.2 or something like that I think. You'll need to eject or use plain react-native.. I think overriding the remove child/view method, and adding the same if statement (as in addView) for checking if the instance is a RenderableView or not, should fix it. The whole svg document is rendered using a single SvgView element, which only renders a single bitmap by calling the shadow node render logic.. Can you try with the latest commit from the master branch, I think I have a good enough workaround for now.. Is this still an issue?. @GetSource1234  Can you try this patch? https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts/pull/280. I'm installing XCode 10.1 now to get access to iOS 12.1, only tested up to 11.3 until now.. I've published a proper fix for iOS in v9.2.4\nIf anyone has any issues in either iOS or Android with the latest version, please comment and / or provide a reproduction.. Could you post a reproduction which triggers this exception? I'm not sure if this is the best way to solve this.. I'll close this because of inactivity. Not sure how  \"this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key active\" could possibly happen.. @g33ktony Hmm, do you have react-native Text elements inside the Svg element?. Can you post a full replication? Btw, why do you have RNView/Text elements inside the Svg?. jsx\n            <Animated.View\n              style={[\n                styles.sunshine,\n                {\n                  backgroundColor: color,\n                  opacity: this.sunshineAnimation(index),\n                },\n              ]}\n            />\nThis code creates a native View, try using a Rect element from react-native-svg instead, set the fill instead of backgroundColor, give it a width and height of 240 or whatever you need, and set the opacity. Should work correctly then.. Alternatively, lift the Animated.View outside the Svg element, set position: absolute and place it where you need it.. (With a few corrections) Seems to work fine: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/frowning-bananas\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Defs, Circle, Mask, Use, G } = Svg;\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```. But you can get the same output more efficiently with this:\njsx\n        <Svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 240 240\">\n          <Circle\n            r=\"96\"\n            cx=\"120\"\n            cy=\"120\"\n            fill=\"none\"\n            stroke=\"green\"\n            strokeWidth=\"80\"\n            strokeDasharray=\"301\"\n            strokeDashoffset={0.5 * 96 * Math.PI}\n          />\n        </Svg>. Can you try re-linking react-native-svg? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/795. If any problems remain, or if you have problems because of XCode 10, you can uncheck \"Parallelize builds\" for RNSVG: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/817#issuecomment-432323509. Unrelated to this library, this is unrelated to lock screens.. Animated is probably the way to go. If you want more complex path transitions then can probably get some inspiration here: https://github.com/emonidi/react-native-svg-transforms\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9R2b9TpYMA\nOtherwise you can just do something like this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/simple-chart-animation\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport ZoomableSvg from 'zoomable-svg'; // Version can be specified in package.json\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { G, Circle, Path, Rect } = Svg;\nconst AnimatedCircle = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Circle);\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nclass SvgRoot extends Component {\n  state = {\n    initAnim: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(\n      // Animate over time\n      this.state.initAnim,\n      {\n        toValue: 1,\n        duration: 3000,\n        useNativeDriver: false,\n      }\n    ).start();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const { initAnim } = this.state;\n    let translateRectY = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['50', '0'],\n    });\n    let heightAnim = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['0', '50'],\n    });\n    let rAnim = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['1', '4'],\n    });\n    let strokeAnim = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['0.1', '2'],\n    });\nreturn (\n  <Svg width={width} height={height}>\n    <G transform={this.props.transform}>\n      <AnimatedRect\n        height={heightAnim}\n        y={translateRectY}\n        fill={'green'}\n        width=\"2\"\n        x=\"20\"\n      />\n      <AnimatedCircle\n        stroke=\"rgba(85, 198, 103, 0.8)\"\n        strokeWidth={strokeAnim}\n        cy={translateRectY}\n        fill=\"white\"\n        r={rAnim}\n        cx=\"21\"\n      />\n    </G>\n  </Svg>\n);\n\n}\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    constraints: {\n      translateExtent: [[0, 0], [100, 100]],\n      scaleExtent: [width / height, 5],\n      combine: 'dynamic',\n    },\n  };\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. A full reproduction would be helpful in analysing this, could someone provide one please?. This seems to work fine:jsx\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { Rect } from \"react-native-svg\";\nimport { View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from \"react-native\";\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  touch: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n});\nfunction TouchTest({ i, size = 64 }) {\n  return (\n    \n {\n          console.log(i);\n        }}\n      >\n        \n\n\n  );\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => )}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nAnd this:jsx\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { Rect } from \"react-native-svg\";\nimport { View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from \"react-native\";\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  touch: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n});\nfunction TouchTest({ i, size = 64 }) {\n  return (\n     {\n        console.log(i);\n      }}\n    >\n      \n\n\n\n  );\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => )}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nHow about a reproduction which is actually broken? And which can just be copy-pasted, without further assumptions/modifications required to trigger the issue.. And as a sanity check, what versions are you using?. Oh, that is quite an old release candidate, please upgrade to the latest v6 or v7 of the library. I've fixed some edge-cases in the plain-views branch, could you please test it, seems to work correctly with both fillRule options and stroke now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/d93de53cedccdb7454096e8b0a14161882ede62c\nHere's what I used now:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { Path, G } from \"react-native-svg\";\nimport { View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, Dimensions } from \"react-native\";\nconst { width } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  touch: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n});\nfunction TouchTest({ i, size = 128 }) {\n  return (\n    \n\n {\n            console.log(i);\n          }}\n        />\n         {\n            console.log(i);\n          }}\n        />\n         {\n            console.log(i);\n          }}\n        />\n        \n {\n              console.log(i);\n            }}\n          />\n           {\n              console.log(i);\n            }}\n          />\n        \n\n\n  );\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n          {Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => )}\n        \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n. This also seems to work fine:jsx\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { Path, G } from \"react-native-svg\";\nimport { View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, Dimensions } from \"react-native\";\nconst { width } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  touch: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n});\nfunction TouchTest({ i, size = 128 }) {\n  return (\n     {\n        console.log(i);\n      }}\n    >\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  );\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n          {Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => )}\n        \n {\n            console.log(4);\n          }}\n        >\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nSo, please try with the plain-views branch, and if it works for you I'll release a new version.. @folofse Very interesting, I wonder if that has been the root cause to several other issues people have reported. Could you provide a replication which demonstrates that effect? Would be very useful in eliminating the issue.. @Prefinem What width and height values are you giving your Svg root element? I suspect they might be bigger than supposed to be, causing unnecessary memory use, slower rendering and these touch issues. Could you provide a replication?. Can you try? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a\nIt seems to have the touchable highlights in the inspector showing correctly.. I think I have (gesture) interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. Published a new version (v8.0.10) with fixes for press and gesture / pan handling for both iOS and Android.. If you have a repro showing unexpected behavior with the latest version then that is much appreciated. Can't really upgrade native dependencies in expo without ejecting, by design of expo. . @alexlau811 Great work! So, it seems it would be enough to calculate the bounding box in the setHitArea method, and use that as an early condition to return false in the hitTest. As the bounding box calculation seems to work where CGPathContainsPoint has bugs. This should also speed up the cases where the touch events aren't even intersecting the bounds. I suspect your current workaround probably breaks touch handlers on G elements.. @alexlau811 Can you try this fix? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/fa07f6ef8a340f855a5db720c70ce0bd5d10839d. Published v9.2.4 with the fixes. Thanks for your help!. Try to unlink and link the project again. Very strange, can you try\nrm -rf node_modules\nAnd run yarn / npm. If any problems remain, or if you want an alternative solution to the legacy build system, you can uncheck \"Parallelize builds\" for RNSVG: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/817#issuecomment-432323509. Please provide a full replication. This works fine in a clean project and the issue is probably unrelated to this library.. Expo uses an older version than v7, can ask them to upgrade or just eject. Are you using Image from react native? That doesn't work inside svg components. You need to import from react-native-svg like here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/README.md#image. Seems to work fine:\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@msand/test-image\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Image, Rect } = Svg;\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n alert('press')}\n          />\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\nAs always with any open-source, please provide full replications, not just small snippets of code which demand ludicrous amounts of work from volunteers who help out for free. Remember, you're the ones paid to fix these issues, not me.. Does it work with v6.5.2 ? I wonder if it could be related to this: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/763\nIs the problem on both iOS and Android? Or just one?. This seems to work in both iOS and Android with the latest commit from the master branch at least:jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Svg, Image, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n alert('press')}\n          />\n           alert('press')}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. Perhaps you we're using clipping? The implementation has changed to be more spec conformant (and there was a regression as well until 8.0.6, you might need to move your clipRule attribute to the ClipPath elements from the elements where you have the clipPath attribute.. Seems to work fine, I guess it's just the typescript definitions. A pr to fix that would be very welcome.. This seems to work fine at least:\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@msand/animate-rect-widthjsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Rect } = Svg;\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nconst AnimatedSvg = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Svg);\nclass SvgRoot extends Component {\n  state = {\n    initAnim: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(\n      // Animate over time\n      this.state.initAnim,\n      {\n        toValue: 1,\n        duration: 3000,\n        useNativeDriver: false,\n      }\n    ).start();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const { initAnim } = this.state;\n    let animateWidth = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['0', '80'],\n    });\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. Do you have useNativeDriver: false?. Please try with the latest commit from the master branch, it should work both with and without native driver now, at least this code seems to work fine:jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Dimensions, Animated } from \"react-native\";\nimport Svg, { Defs, LinearGradient, Rect, Stop } from \"react-native-svg\";\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nconst barWidth = width * 0.3454;\nconst barHeight = barWidth * 0.093;\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\n/*\n * Component\n /\nclass HealthManaBar extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    width: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\nrectangleRef = React.createRef();\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    const { currentValue, totalValue } = this.props;\n    this.animate(currentValue, totalValue);\n  }\ncomponentDidUpdate({ currentValue, totalValue }) {\n    this.animate(currentValue, totalValue);\n  }\nanimate = (current, total) =>\n    Animated.timing(this.state.width, {\n      toValue: current / total,\n      duration: 4000,\n      useNativeDriver: true,\n    }).start();\nrender() {\n    const { variant } = this.props;\n    const { width } = this.state;\nreturn (\n  <Svg width={barWidth} height={barHeight}>\n    <Defs>\n      <LinearGradient\n        id={`HeathManaBar-gradient-${variant}`}\n        x1=\"0\"\n        y1=\"0\"\n        x2=\"0\"\n        y2={barHeight}\n      >\n        <Stop\n          offset=\"0\"\n          stopColor={variant === \"HEALTH\" ? \"#EC561B\" : \"#00ACE1\"}\n          stopOpacity=\"1\"\n        />\n        <Stop\n          offset=\"0.5\"\n          stopColor={variant === \"HEALTH\" ? \"#8D1B00\" : \"#003FAA\"}\n          stopOpacity=\"1\"\n        />\n        <Stop\n          offset=\"1\"\n          stopColor={variant === \"HEALTH\" ? \"#9F3606\" : \"#007C97\"}\n          stopOpacity=\"1\"\n        />\n      </LinearGradient>\n    </Defs>\n    <AnimatedRect\n      x=\"0\"\n      y=\"0\"\n      rx=\"3\"\n      ry=\"3\"\n      rectwidth={width.interpolate({\n        inputRange: [0, 1],\n        outputRange: [0, barWidth],\n      })}\n      width={width.interpolate({\n        inputRange: [0, 1],\n        outputRange: [0, barWidth],\n      })}\n      height={barHeight}\n      fill={`url(#HeathManaBar-gradient-${variant})`}\n    />\n  </Svg>\n);\n\n}\n}\nexport default function App() {\n  return ;\n}\n```.

The rectwith is needed if you want the native animation to work, the width and height properties have a naming collision with the same property name, so they have the element name prepended on the native side, and Animated needs the native name to be able to animate it with useNativeDriver set to true. Hopefully the naming collision could be avoided somehow, and the correct name would be sufficient.. I would actually expect that we can get rid of the {use,mask,image,bb,pattern,rect}{width,height} attributes and just use width and height instead, as I've been able to override the transform\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/fb4e877c2b23b4c52971c16d42c305d9f28a9eb5#diff-50f7e7f8735df31a6ac08ae41511a2a6R262\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/fb4e877c2b23b4c52971c16d42c305d9f28a9eb5#diff-ba367d8c1ef85007a13efc389f1b0608R156\nview property handlers in the view managers, it should be possible to do the same with them as well.. @IljaDaderko I've simplified the handling in the way I thought should be possible: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/445780c121dbc5d8a683a7d33437ce84520f7583\nNow you can skip rectwidth and simply use width instead, both with and without useNativeDriver:jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Dimensions, Animated } from \"react-native\";\nimport Svg, {\n  LinearGradient,\n  Defs,\n  Rect,\n  Stop,\n  Text,\n} from \"react-native-svg\";\nconst { width } = Dimensions.get(\"window\");\nconst barWidth = width * 0.5;\nconst barHeight = barWidth * 0.5;\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nconst AnimatedText = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Text);\nclass HealthManaBar extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    width: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    const { currentValue, totalValue } = this.props;\n    this.animate(currentValue, totalValue);\n  }\ncomponentDidUpdate({ currentValue, totalValue }) {\n    this.animate(currentValue, totalValue);\n  }\nanimate = (current, total) =>\n    Animated.timing(this.state.width, {\n      toValue: current / total,\n      duration: 4000,\n      useNativeDriver: true,\n    }).start();\nrender() {\n    const { variant } = this.props;\n    const { width } = this.state;\nreturn (\n  <Svg width={barWidth} height={barHeight}>\n    <Defs>\n      <LinearGradient\n        id={`HeathManaBar-gradient-${variant}`}\n        x1=\"0\"\n        y1=\"0\"\n        x2=\"0\"\n        y2={barHeight}\n      >\n        <Stop\n          offset=\"0\"\n          stopColor={variant === \"HEALTH\" ? \"#EC561B\" : \"#00ACE1\"}\n          stopOpacity=\"1\"\n        />\n        <Stop\n          offset=\"0.5\"\n          stopColor={variant === \"HEALTH\" ? \"#8D1B00\" : \"#003FAA\"}\n          stopOpacity=\"1\"\n        />\n        <Stop\n          offset=\"1\"\n          stopColor={variant === \"HEALTH\" ? \"#9F3606\" : \"#007C97\"}\n          stopOpacity=\"1\"\n        />\n      </LinearGradient>\n    </Defs>\n    <AnimatedRect\n      x=\"0\"\n      y=\"0\"\n      rx=\"3\"\n      ry=\"3\"\n      width={width.interpolate({\n        inputRange: [0, 1],\n        outputRange: [0, barWidth],\n      })}\n      height={barHeight}\n      fill={`url(#HeathManaBar-gradient-${variant})`}\n    />\n    <AnimatedText\n      x={width.interpolate({\n        inputRange: [0, 2],\n        outputRange: [0, barWidth],\n      })}\n      y={width.interpolate({\n        inputRange: [0, 2],\n        outputRange: [0, barHeight],\n      })}\n    >\n      Test\n    </AnimatedText>\n  </Svg>\n);\n\n}\n}\nexport default function App() {\n  return ;\n}\n```\n. The difference between useNativeDriver: false and true, is that when false: the animation is driven by javascript calling setNativeProps on the animated element; when true: the animation is serialised and sent over the bridge to be driven by the native animation driver events, without any further processing from js, which is much faster in essentially every case and doesn't get blocked by long running js computations. The main reason one would disable the native driver is if the properties one needs to animate aren't supported.\nBut, my commits from the past two days should be relatively good inspiration for how to get support for all the remaining properties. To get js driven (useNativeDriver: falsy) animation, the js property extraction logic needs to be run in the setNativeProps handler of the svg elements, and to get useNativeDriver: true support, the property setters in the native view managers need to change their input parameter type to Dynamic (java) / id (obj-c) and the appropriate transformation done from the values provided by the native driver to the types expected by the shadow nodes / native views.\nThese would be excellent first issues / PRs for anyone interested in contributing to wider animation support. \u2764\ufe0f . Now with useNativeDriver animation support for all number accepting properties: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/864d7610d3aaea2b4e4f722f04ea52ddf292aae7. Yeah, this is expected, the stroke and fill extraction logic isn't run in setNativeProps (yet, perhaps a pr would be in order \ud83d\ude04), you can replicate the logic in the way you've done, or reuse parts of extractStroke (which is run in extractProps):\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/4e6ba9a786787672398dc32981ab81f2c3e8c187/elements/Circle.js#L24-L42\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/e7d0eb6df676d4f63f9eba7c0cf5ddd6c4c85fbe/lib/extract/extractProps.js#L42-L43\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/d0c0b048bfb9035cede8254436875ab5e57ea3f7/lib/extract/extractStroke.js#L30-L41\nThe native side expects an array of strings in this case:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/864d7610d3aaea2b4e4f722f04ea52ddf292aae7/ios/ViewManagers/RNSVGRenderableManager.m#L39\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/fb4e877c2b23b4c52971c16d42c305d9f28a9eb5/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m#L114-L134\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/864d7610d3aaea2b4e4f722f04ea52ddf292aae7/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableViewManager.java#L1020-L1023\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/864d7610d3aaea2b4e4f722f04ea52ddf292aae7/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableShadowNode.java#L155-L167\nI don't know if useNativeDriver allows animating an array of numbers this way, but at least it should work without it. Otherwise, you can use my fork of react-native which has support for string interpolation, it should work there at least.. Reading the code now, I noticed that percentage values in strokeDashArray can't possibly be working correctly in iOS as it just takes the floatValue of the string.. Great. Yeah, just thought I would mention the % issue as I noticed it's not spec conformant, more a note to self for later.\nWell, I would love to have a bit more testing of it before releasing. But as things usually go, the only way to get significant amounts of testing is to make a new release, most people don't live on the bleeding edge of the master branch. I could probably merge some PRs and cut a new release today, to speed up the process. People can always downgrade to whatever version worked the best previously and open issues to report any problems.. Published v7.1.0 now. You're welcome, happy we got it fixed \ud83c\udf89 \nI've simplified the property handling in the javascript side now, as the view managers can handle both string and number types with the recent changes: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/1e25870f5d04b91112e7167240dd1a7d4958815f. Thanks for this, should this be under a minor or major version bump? I guess some might have been relying on these being available. Perhaps better with a major bump?. Ideally we would have the types and interfaces generated from the IDL spec of svg and the related standards using https://github.com/motiz88/webidl-to-flow and \nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator/blob/master/baselines/dom.generated.d.ts\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator/master/inputfiles/browser.webidl.preprocessed.json\nor using:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/idl.html \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/types.html\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/#idl-index\nand any other needed idl files.\nIt could even be used to generate the react components, java & obj-c (and c++ for fiber) interface and view managers.. @n-sviridenko If you're in a hurry, then you can use his fork for now: https://github.com/janicduplessis/react-native-svg/tree/no-proptypes. Merged and released v8.0.0, thanks for the PR again!. I wonder if it could be related to this: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/c39b3267f1b970112fd96a5608ad2cec931ac277\nBecause this probably changed on what thread the rendering is done.\nBut, it seems more like the ViewManagerPropertyUpdater uses an incorrect FallbackShadowNodeSetter to set the fill property, somehow it seems to confuse the fill property with a MutableYogaValue and calls LayoutShadowNode.setPositionValues on it, which leads to this line: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/uimanager/LayoutShadowNode.java#L65\nIt seems to be missing a check for the number type before calling dynamic.asDouble() \n java\n      else if (dynamic.getType() == ReadableType.Number) {\n        unit = YogaUnit.POINT;\n        value = PixelUtil.toPixelFromDIP(dynamic.asDouble());\n      }\nI wonder why it doesn't use the setter from the view manager:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/v7.0.3/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableViewManager.java#L707\nand the shadow node:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/v7.0.3/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableShadowNode.java#L80\nTricky to analyse without a reproduction.. Currently, the Views on Android are only used to get access to the shadow nodes for native animation: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableView.java#L8\nEssentially all the data and logic is in the shadow nodes for now. Only the svg root has a View which gets attached to the render tree, and it only renders lazily (by calling into the shadow node) and caches the bitmap until the next invalidation. I suspect this might cause some race conditions, if the shadow nodes / trees are  modified, while the svg root is rendering the bitmap.. Thanks for this, could you try with the latest commit from the master branch?. Could you post the code or a small reproduction that can produce it? I'm not sure how the dynamic value could be recycled, perhaps it isn't even a string? At least react-native-svg doesn't make any recycle calls on any dynamic values.. I've been testing this code for some time now and haven't been able to observe any exceptions. Not sure how to trigger it:\n```jsx\n// @flow\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { Button, StyleSheet, View, Animated } from \"react-native\";\nimport Svg, { Line, Circle } from \"react-native-svg\";\nconst AnimatedLine = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Line);\nconst AnimatedCircle = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Circle);\ntype Props = {\n  style?: any,\n  backgroundIsTurquoise?: boolean,\n};\ntype State = {\n  anim: Animated.Value,\n};\nclass Loading extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    anim: new Animated.Value(0),\n    hide: false,\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    Animated.loop(\n      Animated.timing(this.state.anim, {\n        duration: 2000,\n        toValue: 1,\n        isInteraction: false,\n        useNativeDriver: true,\n      }),\n    ).start();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const opacity = this.state.anim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 0.93, 1],\n      outputRange: [1, 1, 0],\n    });\n    const yellowBarOffset = this.state.anim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 0.2, 1],\n      outputRange: [22, 0, 0],\n    });\n    const greenBarOffset = this.state.anim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 0.19, 0.4, 1],\n      outputRange: [30.01, 30.01, 0, 0],\n    });\n    const pinkBarOffset = this.state.anim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 0.4, 0.78, 1],\n      outputRange: [107, 107, 50, 50],\n    });\nconst secondLineColor = this.props.backgroundIsTurquoise\n  ? \"white\"\n  : \"turquoise\";\nconst { hide } = this.state;\n\nreturn (\n  <View>\n    <Button\n      title=\"Toggle\"\n      onPress={() => this.setState(({ hide }) => ({ hide: !hide }))}\n    />\n    <Animated.View style={[{ opacity }, this.props.style]}>\n      {hide ? null : (\n        <Svg width={70} height={70}>\n          <AnimatedLine\n            stroke={secondLineColor}\n            strokeWidth=\"8\"\n            strokeLinecap=\"round\"\n            strokeDasharray={[30]}\n            strokeDashoffset={greenBarOffset}\n            x1=\"48\"\n            y1=\"15\"\n            x2=\"29\"\n            y2=\"34.2\"\n          />\n          <AnimatedCircle\n            fill=\"transparent\"\n            stroke=\"pink\"\n            strokeWidth=\"8\"\n            strokeLinecap=\"round\"\n            strokeDasharray={[107]}\n            strokeDashoffset={pinkBarOffset}\n            rotation=\"-127\"\n            origin=\"36, 44\"\n            cx=\"36\"\n            cy=\"44\"\n            r=\"12\"\n          />\n          <AnimatedLine\n            stroke=\"yellow\"\n            strokeWidth=\"8.5\"\n            strokeLinecap=\"round\"\n            strokeDasharray={[22]}\n            strokeDashoffset={yellowBarOffset}\n            x1=\"26\"\n            y1=\"14.5\"\n            x2=\"48\"\n            y2=\"14.5\"\n          />\n        </Svg>\n      )}\n    </Animated.View>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\n    backgroundColor: \"beige\",\n  },\n});\n```. I guess it's related to the native animation driver when it's setting the animated properties, I think it runs on the main ui thread. It's quite likely that the PR would fix it, would be great if you can test it :+1 . @Almouro Great! Thanks for the info.\nI guess the other components don't use dynamic as the type of any parameters which are animated. I haven't been able to observe the error myself, so haven't been able to dig deeper.\nI think the other error is probably something else, opening a new issue is probably appropriate yes.. @janicduplessis Could you champion getting that PR merged for 0.58? or 0.57.4?. @Almouro Can you try v7.1.0 I suspect https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/1e25870f5d04b91112e7167240dd1a7d4958815f to be the culprit.. @janicduplessis Are there any drawbacks to using Dynamic? There is at least some performance penalty, because of the branching on type in the view property setters, and wrapping the JavaOnlyMap in a DynamicFromMap. But other than that, I can't see any significant differences between Dynamic and otherwise. At least from a quick reading of: \nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/bridge/Dynamic.java\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/bridge/DynamicFromMap.java\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/bridge/JavaOnlyMap.java\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/uimanager/ReactStylesDiffMap.java\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.57-stable/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/uimanager/ViewManagersPropertyCache.java. @Almouro Can you try with the latest commit from the master branch? I've simplified the dynamic property setters in android and improved the null handling logic.. There's a potentially significant optimisation opportunity in the property handling, for any props which currently take a string to allow for units. There's a redundant round-trip from a double to a string back to a double, when animating the properties (or whenever the given value is a double / Number). The common case is probably a unit-less number anyway, so it would make sense to optimise for that. To maintain spec-conformance, it would require adding an enum for the units, another field signifying the unit for each property, and, that the property setters would handle the case when the value is a string, such that it sets the unit correctly. And finally, the relativeOnWidth/Height/Other (css units to pixels resolvers) would need to accept a number and a enum unit instead of a string.. Another optimisation opportunity would be to rename the fields such that the propertyNameToFieldName could be removed.. Also, as @janicduplessis wrote. The shadow nodes could be removed, by creating separate View classes and moving the logic from the shadow nodes there instead. Because the SvgViewManager returns true for needsCustomLayoutForChildren anyway, and we're already creating a View for each element (to allow for animation). So it should actually conserve memory, and possibly improve  performance as well. Or are there any benefits to having the shadow nodes I'm unaware of? As we're not using yoga for layout (except for the root svg element position and dimension) they should just be redundant, right?. At least currently, having the shadow nodes causes an extra de-referencing for each time a property is set using the ViewManagers, and we keep a\njava\n    private final SparseArray<T> mTagToShadowNode = new SparseArray<>();\nto get a reference to it (costing memory and accounting on View creation/destruction), which wouldn't be needed if the logic was simply inside the Views instead.. I now have a branch where I've moved the logic into the Views and almost completely removed the ShadowNodes. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/0bdca66e2de07bd964f917fb04d4c60b9d3c0b0e\nIt certainly seems to perform better.. @msageryd Could you try your app with the latest commit from master and the one from the plain-views branch to see if there's any significant changes? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/plain-views.  The current latest commit in the plain-views branch seems to work in all tests I have quickly testable. Don't see any reasons not to cut another release at this point. Unless you know of any regressions?\nCould perhaps still do the refactoring to optimise for doubles / unitless numbers, but I'm not sure when exactly I would have time to finish that.. @janicduplessis Would it be possible to get that PR cherrypicked for v0.57.4? Seems it should probably be the recommended minimum for any version of react-native-svg using Dynamic. And the plain views branch should probably become the recommended v7 version, to eliminate the null exceptions.. I've implemented the optimizations in the SVGLength branch now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/SVGLength\nCommit msg: Optimize setting properties and animation: Implement SVGLength\nRemoves redundant round-trip (double > string > double) when animating.\nOptimizes for the case when dynamic arguments are numbers.\nImproves memory consumption and cpu load.. The css value resolvers could still be made to get the canvas width/height and font-size only when needed, instead of every time.. Implemented fast path for css resolvers, android: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/2a449c3bd4b2095427c35a17d81b025e5a1dd713 ios: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/00f0b66c131c88d43a4790c482bbb5e51c23f662. I've fixed all known remaining regressions from the rewrite now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/SVGLength\nNow it should be more spec conformant, stable, faster, memory efficient and easier to read.. @janicduplessis Excellent! Now it is, v7.2.0 just published \ud83c\udf89 https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg/v/7.2.0. @msageryd Hmm, both those examples (Lines) work fine for me in v7.2.0\nI merged the PR from @janicduplessis to remove prop-types and released v8.0.0, so that warning won't be bothering you again ;). I've made the Svg element return a G element and set some of the styles and props from the root element on it, to allow inheritance of values without another significant refactor, should perhaps omit a bit more of the properties, but don't know of any actual issues that could result from it as of now. So, all Svg content currently have an implicit G element in the root.. @msageryd Regarding numbers and strings, I recommend using numbers, but both should work, it's just that numbers are cheaper with regards to memory, cpu and energy. Much of the recent work has been to optimize for the case when the arguments are plain numbers rather than string encoded.. @msageryd From the error message, it seems like these two lines would be missing from the code you've built: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/75204047c9424c591ed42d9763d6547709cf2b8b/ios/ViewManagers/RNSVGNodeManager.m#L176-L177\nCan you try a clean rebuild with v8?\nOtherwise, can you try adding those two lines somewhere together with these (e.g. before or after, but replace RNSVGNode with RNSVGUse) : https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/75204047c9424c591ed42d9763d6547709cf2b8b/ios/ViewManagers/RNSVGUseManager.m#L21-L32. @msageryd perhaps you were using the plain-views branch? I tested in the master branch (essentially the SVGLength branch + some minor fixes, which builds on the plain-views one).. Thanks for reporting, will look at it later tonight once I get back to a computer . @janicduplessis I think I've fixed the issue, really wouldn't expect this to be necessary changes to the code. But oh well, yet another day to learn about obj-c/ios intricacies. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/e5768133295cbd4e70f4ab339d0aba1d1ad759b5. This should be fixed in the latest versions, closing the issue now.. I guess it's related to this: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/763\n@mike-marcacci Could you check this out?. So, upgrade to the latest version (or any after that pr got merged) to fix it. Please make sure to test in the latest version before opening an issue. . This came in v7.1.1 while doing some cleanup and fixing an unused param warning: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/6f256f1da142b6ab4eb0bd1422883aae5db5e3f3#diff-c9ec180f3cc5aa90652568270487b6caL34\nThanks for the PR!\nWhat other issues are you experiencing?. Oops. Thanks for this! Apparently I didn't read the rest of the line correctly when fixing the unused parameter warning.. Published v7.1.2 now, thanks a bunch!. @mars-lan Can you try with the latest commit from the master branch?. or, if that doesn't help, then the latest commit from the plain-views branch: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/plain-views\ncurrently https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/585acee2819c27d334ef0a0cefb92114e85bb614. if neither one of those fixes it, then please provide a reproduction, which can be run straight away by a simple copy-paste, or as a clone-able repo.. Closing until a full replication is provided.. Can you try with the latest commit from the plain-views branch? . At least I think the plain-views branch should resolve specifically this kind of problems, as it's not using the shadow nodes to set any properties, they can't be null or cause exceptions. If the plain-views branch renders correctly for you locally, and all press handlers / gesture responders behave correctly, then I would say it's safe use the plain-views branch and publish a new version using that. At this point I don't know of any regressions, so essentially I'm just giving a bit of time in hopes of getting feedback on it, but could just as well cut a new release.. @Almouro  Is this issue still occuring?. I would assume this is fixed since removing the shadow nodes. Otherwise, we can probably introduce a null check or try to isolate the issue better. Please comment or reopen if you still observe exceptions with the latest version.. @pro-nasa Thanks for this! Looks like it should work. Could you move the _extractText helpers outside the component, they're not using this, so no need to attach them to this either no?. Excellent! Small cosmetic thing still, tspanElement could simply be TSpan instead. Would you mind restoring that naming?. Great, thanks!. Seems you have some caching issues. Try\nwatchman watch-del-all\nrm -fr $TMPDIR/react-*\nnpm start -- --reset-cache\nOr, \nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm i\nnpm start -- --reset-cache\nv7.1.2 doesn't have the import your error refers to, it imports from \"../lib/units\" instead of \"../lib/PATTERN_UNITS\":\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/v7.1.2/elements/Pattern.js#L5. Can you try removing the object with the transform property which is wrapping the object with the rotation, i think then it should apply the origin props as well. . Hmm, actually, that probably wouldn't work either, as the origin properties wouldn't be given in setNativeProps, perhaps something more like if you want to use react-native transforms:\njsx\n    this.state.rotation.addListener(({ value }) => {\n      this.circleRef.setNativeProps({\n        transform: [\n          { translateX: 24 },\n          { translateY: 24 },\n          { rotate: value.toString() },\n          { translateX: -24 },\n          { translateY: -24 },\n        ]\n      })\n    })\n  }\nor this if you want the legacy react-native-svg shorthands\njsx\n    this.state.rotation.addListener(({ value }) => {\n      this.circleRef.setNativeProps({\n          rotate: value,\n          originX: 24,\n          originY: 24\n      })\n    })\n  }\nor this if you want standard svg\njsx\n    this.state.rotation.addListener(({ value }) => {\n      this.circleRef.setNativeProps({\n          transform: `rotate(${value}, 24, 24)`\n      })\n    })\n  }\nOr, alternatively, just use the viewBox attribute to move the origin to the center of the canvas and set cx/cy to zero:\njsx\n  public render() {\n    return (\n      <Svg width=\"48\" height=\"48\" viewBox=\"-24 -24 48 48\">\n        <Circle\n          ref={ref => {\n            this.circleRef = ref\n          }}\n          cx=\"0\"\n          cy=\"0\"\n          r={radius.toString()}\n          stroke=\"black\"\n          strokeWidth={2}\n          fill=\"none\"\n          strokeLinecap=\"round\"\n          strokeDasharray={`${circumference.toString()} ${circumference.toString()}`}\n          strokeDashoffset={offset.toString()}\n        />\n      </Svg>\n    )\n  }. Btw, it doesn't really make sense to use the native driver + a javascript event listener to call setNativeProps, if you're using setNativeProps to drive the changes you probably shouldn't use the native driver. Either wrap the Circle with animated and set the style={{transform}} using the array of react-native transforms there (for plain native driven animation), or remove/set useNativeDriver to false.. Or perhaps something like this:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { Circle } from \"react-native-svg\";\nimport extractStroke from \"react-native-svg/lib/extract/extractStroke\";\nimport { Animated, Easing } from \"react-native\";\nconst radius = 22.8;\nconst circumference = radius * 2 * Math.PI;\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    rotation: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    Animated.loop(\n      Animated.timing(this.state.rotation, {\n        toValue: circumference,\n        duration: 10000,\n        easing: Easing.linear\n      }),\n    ).start();\nthis.state.rotation.addListener(({ value }) => {\n  this.circleRef.setNativeProps(\n    extractStroke({\n      stroke: \"black\",\n      strokeWidth: 2,\n      strokeLinecap: \"round\",\n      strokeDasharray: circumference,\n      strokeDashoffset: value,\n    }, []),\n  );\n});\n\n}\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n {\n            this.circleRef = ref;\n          }}\n          cx=\"24\"\n          cy=\"24\"\n          r={radius}\n          fill=\"none\"\n        />\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nSeems there's something a bit unexpected with the transforms, will have to look into it later on.. Hmm, i would expect it work, or don't know of any related changes at least. Can you try unlink and linking again? . Did you try pod update?\nEdit: didn't notice the mention of pod install. Or is there some cache to reset in app center? (i have no experience with it) . Can you please try with the https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/ios_build_simplification branch?. @joaom182 Could you make a git repo which I can git clone and npm install && react-native run-ios to test?. Can you try with a clean project?\nreact-native init CleanProject\ncd CleanProject/\nyarn add react-native-svg\nreact-native link\n```\nReplace app.js with this:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Svg, { Rect } from \"react-native-svg\";\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nreact-native run-android\nreact-native run-ios. @msageryd I haven't upgraded XCode yet because of the significant number of problems people have been reporting around it, and the version I have works perfectly fine for now. I'm no expert in the XCode build system either, so I think it would probably be best to try and find someone properly experienced in that to take a look at it, perhaps they'll find something else to improve at the same time. Otherwise I'll probably upgrade XCode once a react-native version with proper support for it gets released.. \nI wonder if the relative order of the files in the build phases could have any effect. Could you try moving RNSVGLength.m before RNSVGPainter.m and see if the error disappears / changes? @msageryd . How about if you uncheck \"Parallelize Build\"?\n\n. I see, alright. Well, thanks for trying it out. Not sure what to try next. Guess I'll have to upgrade xcode to investigate further. Would you happen to know any ios/xcode expert?. Ah excellent. So, now to figure out how to make react-native link uncheck parallelize perhaps?. So, this is not an actual issue with the library, rather the setup/linking. Closing now.. Please try v8.0.2, a regression was introduced in v8.0.0. Are you sure you have the latest version? V8.0.1 is the current one. That exception shouldn't be possible, the method shouldn't even exist. . Could you post a small replication? . @skymax406 Can you try this one: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/13b91aab39481eb708a580a87d7118c6180d0e23. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. @kay-is Can you try v8.0.3? A regression was introduced in 8.0.0 and fixed in 8.0.2 at least, not sure if there are others as well. Please post a reproduction otherwise.. Is this on Android, iOS or both?. @jans-y Could you provide a replication? Haven't had any time to look at this yet. Any help in solving it much appreciated!. Can you try? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a\nOr, if that doesn't solve it, could you please make a git repo with the needed files to run your test case?. I wonder if this might be related to the center point, I think that might not be set correctly yet: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622580-bounds?language=objc. Can you try using the inspector, and click the touchables mode, so you can see all the touchable areas, before and after rotation?. @sinewave440hz I have another attempt here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/37f07050e4867da33b58ece871881efdb4cd1123\nIt seems to handle transforms correctly, and draws reasonable touchable areas in the tests I've done so far.. Here's a test case:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  Text,\n  View,\n  TouchableWithoutFeedback,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Dimensions,\n  Animated,\n  Platform,\n} from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, {\n  Defs,\n  LinearGradient,\n  Stop,\n  RadialGradient,\n  G,\n  Path,\n  Circle,\n  Rect,\n  ClipPath,\n  Symbol,\n  Use,\n  Image,\n  Text as SvgText,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nconst AnimatedG = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(G);\nconst AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path);\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: 'white',\n  },\n  demo: {\n    width: 200,\n    height: 200,\n    backgroundColor: 'orange',\n  },\n  text: { color: 'white' },\n});\nclass TouchesMove extends Component {\n  handlers = {\n    onPress: () => {\n      this.setEvent('onPress');\n    },\n    onPressIn: () => {\n      this.setEvent('onPressIn');\n    },\n    onPressOut: () => {\n      this.setEvent('onPressOut');\n    },\n  };\nstate = {\n    rotation: new Animated.Value(0),\n    event: 'Last press event will be shown here.',\n  };\nstopAnimation() {\n    this.state.rotation.stopAnimation();\n    this.setState({ rotation: new Animated.Value(0) });\n  }\nstartAnimation() {\n    Animated.loop(\n      Animated.timing(this.state.rotation, {\n        useNativeDriver: true,\n        duration: 3000,\n        toValue: 1,\n      }),\n    ).start();\n  }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.startAnimation();\n  }\nsetEvent(event) {\n    this.setState({ event });\n  }\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n\n          {null || (\n            \n          )}\n          \n\n            {null || (\n              \n                {'react-native-svg '}\n              \n            )}\n          \n\n\n\n{'react-native '}\n\n\n{this.state.event}\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n```. I think I have interactions between native animated transforms and normal svg transforms working correctly now: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/8c05da043dea3f8d04420c2d7c9c11733e22258b. @sinewave440hz seems the workaround found by @folofse works: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/794#issuecomment-436575946\nAlso reported on the react-native repo: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21996\nAnd https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/5007\nIt boils down to adding a overflow: hidden to the wrapping view, made a pr here: https://github.com/sinewave440hz/DialTest/pull/1\nI wonder what causes this, what has changed between iOS 11 and 12 with regards to touch/gesture handling? Not sure if the underlying cause is in react-native, or this library yet. I would love any help in investigating this!. @kay-is I tried moving the panResponder in your example to a wrapping view, seems like a functional workaround for now: \n```tsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  View,\n  StyleSheet,\n  StyleProp,\n  ViewStyle,\n  PanResponder,\n  PanResponderInstance,\n} from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Circle, G, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nclass CircularSlider extends React.Component<\n  { value: number; onRelease?: Function; style?: StyleProp },\n  { active: boolean; value: number; cx: number; cy: number; r: number }\n\n{\n  width = 275;\n  height = 275;\n  private panResponder: PanResponderInstance;\n\nconstructor(\n    props: Readonly<{\n      value: number;\n      onRelease?: Function;\n      style?: StyleProp;\n    }>,\n  ) {\n    super(props);\n    const { width, height } = this;\n    const smallestSide = Math.min(width, height);\nconst value = this.props.value * 3.6;\n\nthis.state = {\n  active: false,\n  value: value || 0,\n  cx: width / 2,\n  cy: height / 2,\n  r: smallestSide / 2 * 0.85,\n};\nthis.panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n  onStartShouldSetPanResponder: () => true,\n  onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: () => true,\n  onPanResponderMove: this.handlePanResponderMove,\n  onPanResponderRelease: this.handlePanResponderRelease,\n  onPanResponderGrant: () => this.setState({ active: true }),\n});\n\n}\ncomponentWillReceiveProps = ({ value }: { value: number }) => {\n    if (value >= 100) value = 99;\n    this.setState({ value: Math.round(value * 3.6) });\n  };\npolarToCartesian = (angle: number) => {\n    const { cx, cy, r } = this.state,\n      a = (angle - 270) * Math.PI / 180.0,\n      x = cx + r * Math.cos(a),\n      y = cy + r * Math.sin(a);\n    return { x, y };\n  };\ncartesianToPolar = (x: number, y: number) => {\n    const { cx, cy } = this.state;\n    return Math.round(\n      Math.atan((y - cy) / (x - cx)) / (Math.PI / 180) + (x > cx ? 270 : 90),\n    );\n  };\nhandlePanResponderMove = ({\n    nativeEvent: { locationX, locationY },\n  }: {\n    nativeEvent: { locationX: number; locationY: number };\n  }) => {\n    console.log({ locationX, locationY });\n    this.setState({\n      value: this.cartesianToPolar(locationX, locationY),\n    });\n  };\nhandlePanResponderRelease = () => {\n    this.setState({ active: false });\n    const value = Math.floor(this.state.value / 3.6);\n    if (this.props.onRelease) this.props.onRelease(value);\n  };\nrender() {\n    const { width, height } = this;\n    const { cx, cy, r, value } = this.state;\nconst startCoord = this.polarToCartesian(0);\nconst endCoord = this.polarToCartesian(value);\nconst path = `\n  M ${startCoord.x} ${startCoord.y}\n  A ${r} ${r} 0 ${value > 180 ? 1 : 0} 1 ${endCoord.x} ${endCoord.y}`;\n\nreturn (\n  <View\n    style={[{ overflow: 'hidden' }, this.props.style]}\n    {...this.panResponder.panHandlers}\n  >\n    <Svg width={width} height={height}>\n      <Circle\n        cx={cx}\n        cy={cy}\n        r={r}\n        stroke=\"#aaa\"\n        strokeDasharray={[1, 6]}\n        strokeWidth={7}\n        fill=\"none\"\n      />\n\n      <Path stroke=\"#eee\" strokeWidth={7} fill=\"none\" d={path} />\n\n      <G x={endCoord.x - 7.5} y={endCoord.y - 7.5}>\n        <Circle\n          cx={7.5}\n          cy={7.5}\n          r={this.state.active ? 20 : 16}\n          fill=\"#fff\"\n        />\n      </G>\n    </Svg>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\ninterface Props {}\ninterface State {}\nexport default class DialTest extends Component {\n  state = {\n    value: 1,\n  };\nonRelease = (value: number) => {\n    this.setState({ value });\n  };\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    paddingTop: 30,\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#0A0A0A',\n  },\n});\n```. @kay-is If you only want it to respond if you click the actual circle, you can check that the distance is within the radius like this:\n```tsx\n    const shouldRespond = (\n      e: GestureResponderEvent,\n      gestureState: PanResponderGestureState,\n    ) => {\n      const { value } = this.state;\n      const { x, y } = this.polarToCartesian(value);\n      const { locationX, locationY } = e.nativeEvent;\n  const dx = x - locationX;\n  const dy = y - locationY;\n  const l2norm = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n\n  return l2norm < 16;\n};\nthis.panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n  onStartShouldSetPanResponder: shouldRespond,\n  onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: shouldRespond,\n  onPanResponderMove: this.handlePanResponderMove,\n  onPanResponderRelease: this.handlePanResponderRelease,\n  onPanResponderGrant: () => this.setState({ active: true }),\n});\n\n```\nI know it's a hack, would be great to find the actual cause for these issues. Do you have any known versions of react-native, react-native-svg and ios simulator where it works correctly?. @kay-is seems like it's enough to move the panHandlers to the svg root element. I wonder if it's just because of the changing position / matrix of the G element which contains the circle, perhaps when the properties are invalidated, but gesture events keep coming, it fails to do the hit testing / inverse transformations and thus gives nonsensical locations in the gesture events.. @shergin Do you know about any changes related to hit testing requiring overflow: hidden for iOS 12 and react-native? Or someone on the react-native team who has seen something related to this?\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/821#issuecomment-445587423. @kay-is I think I've found the underlying reason for incorrect locations when placing the panResponder on elements inside the svg root rather than on the root itself. I have a fix available here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/6df918356b5df6cde98b78560b3e889199bd67a4\nCan you please test it?. @kay-is Android also had a bug with handling transforms: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/4b65c00912567afb050bf0d094ec6cadcbcc74ef. published v8.0.10 with the fixes. I think this can probably be closed now. Please comment/reopen if you can observe unexpected behavior with the latest version. Thanks for the issue reports!. @kay-is Can you try with the latest version and verify that you rebuild the native code and clear the javascript cache? Seems to work fine with the latest release:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, PanResponder } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Circle, G, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class CircularSlider extends React.Component {\n  width = 275;\n  height = 275;\nconstructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    const { width, height } = this;\n    const smallestSide = Math.min(width, height);\nconst value = this.props.value * 3.6;\n\nthis.state = {\n  active: false,\n  value: value || 0,\n  cx: width / 2,\n  cy: height / 2,\n  r: smallestSide / 2 * 0.85,\n};\n\n}\ncomponentWillMount = () => {\n    this.panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: () => true,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: () => true,\n      onPanResponderMove: this.handlePanResponderMove,\n      onPanResponderRelease: this.handlePanResponderRelease,\n      onPanResponderGrant: () => this.setState({ active: true }),\n    });\n  };\ncomponentWillReceiveProps = ({ value }) => {\n    if (value >= 100) value = 99;\n    this.setState({ value: Math.round(value * 3.6) });\n  };\npolarToCartesian = angle => {\n    const { cx, cy, r } = this.state,\n      a = (angle - 270) * Math.PI / 180.0,\n      x = cx + r * Math.cos(a),\n      y = cy + r * Math.sin(a);\n    return { x, y };\n  };\ncartesianToPolar = (x, y) => {\n    const { cx, cy } = this.state;\n    return Math.round(\n      Math.atan((y - cy) / (x - cx)) / (Math.PI / 180) + (x > cx ? 270 : 90),\n    );\n  };\nhandlePanResponderMove = ({ nativeEvent: { locationX, locationY } }) => {\n    this.setState({\n      value: this.cartesianToPolar(locationX, locationY),\n    });\n  };\nhandlePanResponderRelease = () => {\n    this.setState({ active: false });\n    const value = Math.floor(this.state.value / 3.6);\n    if (this.props.onRelease) this.props.onRelease(value);\n  };\nrender() {\n    const { width, height } = this;\n    const { cx, cy, r, value } = this.state;\nconst startCoord = this.polarToCartesian(0);\nconst endCoord = this.polarToCartesian(value);\nconst path = `\n  M ${startCoord.x} ${startCoord.y}\n  A ${r} ${r} 0 ${value > 180 ? 1 : 0} 1 ${endCoord.x} ${endCoord.y}`;\n\nreturn (\n  <View style={styles.container}>\n    <Svg width={width} height={height} style={this.props.style}>\n      <Circle\n        cx={cx}\n        cy={cy}\n        r={r}\n        stroke=\"#aaa\"\n        strokeDasharray={[1, 6]}\n        strokeWidth={7}\n        fill=\"none\"\n      />\n\n      <Path stroke=\"#eee\" strokeWidth={7} fill=\"none\" d={path} />\n\n      <G x={endCoord.x - 7.5} y={endCoord.y - 7.5}>\n        <Circle\n          cx={7.5}\n          cy={7.5}\n          r={this.state.active ? 20 : 16}\n          fill=\"#fff\"\n          {...this.panResponder.panHandlers}\n        />\n      </G>\n    </Svg>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: 'black',\n  },\n  button: {\n    margin: 40,\n    padding: 20,\n    borderWidth: 1,\n    borderColor: 'black',\n  },\n});\n```. Excellent, happy to hear!. @bobderrico80 Published a fix for the spec conformance of the path parser: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/9affd59b008500e6704c20458186899fd4fc5b70\nAvailable as v8.0.4\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataMovetoCommands\n\nThe \"moveto\" commands (M or m) must establish a new initial point and a new current point. . @netmaxt3r Hmm, strange, can you make full replication? This seems to work fine for me:\n\n```jsx\n// @flow\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Text } from \"react-native\";\nimport { Svg, Rect, Circle, Path } from \"react-native-svg\";\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \nWelcome to React Native!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    flex: 1,\n  },\n});\n```. @netmaxt3r Thanks for this! Published v8.0.8. I don't think we've had support for that yet. Would be nice to have though. You can use onPress directly on the svg elements for now, or isolate the part you want touchable to animate in a separate svg root which you wrap with touchable. This will allow it to just change the opacity of the already rendered svg, rather than re-render its content each frame of the animation.. Yeah, I haven't tested or tried to make it work until now at least, so I would expect it not to work. Not sure exactly what it would require either, haven't looked into what touchable requires of its children to animate them, or to understand their size/position on screen.. Yeah, I've actually already added support in the current work-in-progess branch: filters, you can try that if you want it asap.. Can you make a reproduction?. Closing because of inactivity.. Seems you're using an old version of the library, it currently uses the standard react-native way of setting the library versions: \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/349c3b33675e761ece177884da35cebcd8fc82c0/android/build.gradle#L1-L3\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/2a349f87f78a75163bc5cfd5e5233bfe00524676/local-cli/templates/HelloWorld/android/build.gradle#L4-L10.

You might get some inspiration from this as well: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/845#issuecomment-439592694. Try clearing caches, relinking the library and make a clean build.. Why open an issue about the pattern element if you have problems with the image element? . Can you provide a complete reproduction?. You can try something like this: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/18187#issuecomment-414129298\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Rect, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nconst AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path);\nfunction getInitialState() {\n  const anim = new Animated.Value(0);\n  const fillOpacity = anim.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [0, 1],\n  });\n  const offset = fillOpacity.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [0, 10],\n  });\n  const strokeOpacity = offset.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 10],\n    outputRange: [0, 1],\n    extrapolateRight: 'clamp',\n  });\n  const path = anim.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: ['M20,20L20,80L80,80L80,20Z', 'M40,40L33,60L60,60L65,40Z'],\n  });\n  const fill = strokeOpacity.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: ['rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)', 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.99)'],\n  });\n  const oneToFivePx = offset.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 10],\n    outputRange: ['1px', '5px'],\n  });\n  return { anim, fillOpacity, offset, strokeOpacity, path, fill, oneToFivePx };\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = getInitialState();\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    const { anim } = this.state;\n    Animated.timing(anim, {\n      toValue: 1,\n      duration: 10000,\n    }).start();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const { fillOpacity, offset, strokeOpacity, path, fill, oneToFivePx } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n``. Thanks for this!. @mu29  Thanks for this! Haven't had time to test this yet, also I notice you have \"storkeWidth\" instead of \"strokeWidth\" could this be related to the issue as well?. Ah ok, it's fine as is. Hopefully I'll have some time this weekend for looking at this.. @alexsmartens Hey there, the colors are interpolated linearly, inside any part of the gradient it is normal arithmetic where you have an input parameterxgiving an argument inside the interval[0, 1]with two constantsaandb, and the result is(1-x)a + xb `\nBut, the colors have several color components, so you'll probably want to use something from npm like: \n```js\nconst interpolate = require('color-interpolate');\nlet colormap = interpolate(['red', 'green', 'red']);\nlet redleft = colormap(0); // 'rgb(255, 0, 0)'\nlet inbetween = colormap(.25); // 'rgb(128, 128, 0)'\nlet green = colormap(.5); // 'rgb(0, 255, 0)'\nlet redright = colormap(1); // 'rgb(255, 0, 0)'\nlet colorAnywhereElse = normalizedDistanceAlongAxis => colormap(normalizedDistanceAlongAxis);\n``\nThen just calculate how far along your scale you are as a number and call that function. color-interpolate does clamping for you, i.e. ensuring you stay inside the scale instead of doing extrapolation. So, it does everything you need except the part which is specific for your app: deciding the scale and colors, and mapping touch events back to the scale.\nSo, no need to use the native layer for this, you have all the information you need to calculate this already and going over the bridge would just make things slower.. Seems like your node_modules folder is corrupted, try deleting it andnpm i` again. Seems like local caching issues. Closing.... @marcorm I have it working fine in a clean react-native init at least, can you make a repro?. Thanks!\nHmm, what do you mean? Can you provide a specific svg file which doesn't work? viewbox is certainly supported at least, and I can't find any mentions of it in the linked article.. Ah, this is due to missing support for objectBoundingBox in patternUnits and patternContentUnits atm. We have the calculation for the bounding box available now, so it's relatively easy to get support for it nowadays. Would have to figure out the language of the spec, find some collection of examples which render consistently across evergreen browsers, and make it render the same.. Btw, stop-color should be stopColor instead. And, with the latest commit in the master branch, you can use this to get equivalent output to the original:\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  Svg,\n  Defs,\n  LinearGradient,\n  Stop,\n  Pattern,\n  Rect,\n  Circle,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        <Pattern id=\"Pattern\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\">\n          <Rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" fill=\"skyblue\"/>\n          <Rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" fill=\"url(#Gradient2)\"/>\n          <Circle cx=\"25\" cy=\"25\" r=\"20\" fill=\"url(#Gradient1)\" fill-opacity=\"0.5\"/>\n        </Pattern>\n      </Defs>\n\n      <Rect fill=\"url(#Pattern)\" stroke=\"black\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n    </Svg>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n. ```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, {\n  Defs,\n  LinearGradient,\n  Stop,\n  Path,\n  Pattern,\n  Rect,\n  Circle,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nconst STRIPE_WIDTH = 1 / 7;\nconst STRIPE = 100 * STRIPE_WIDTH;\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\nconst SvgComponent1 = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\nconst SvgComponent2 = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\nconst SvgComponent3 = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```. Android still has a bit of issues with the small magnitudes of the path coordinates when using, patternContentUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\"\nIt might be possible to workaround by setting a global scaling factor of units to the minimum of the width and height of the bounding box, and scaling the canvas to account for the remaining aspect ratio change. I tried and it mostly worked, by some gradients and colors behaved strange.. So, I would recommend using userSpaceOnUse for both patternUnits and patternContentUnits, and using the viewBox of the root svg element to adjust the coordinates / dimensions of the primitives you want to fill with the pattern. Or if you really want patternContentUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\", then you can investigate why android has issues with the small values. . @lachtos Ah, thanks for reporting this. Forgot to test that while implementing it.\nIf you have time to look at this, then these are the relevant parts of the code:\nAndroid: 6 lines of code https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/38310677e3daafd57db622d236fea296d5c8f930/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanView.java#L862-L868\niOS: 33 lines of code https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/72a53f373028e4c1d89286c1e6c93c7a229ebc90/ios/Text/RNSVGTSpan.m#L818-L841. @lachtos Could you provide a full replication? The example you used for the screenshot looks quite useful for debugging/development. Btw, is it an issue on only iOS or Android, or on both? I notice the iOS code doesn't take rotation into account, while it seems Android does. But haven't made any test/example for this yet.. @lachtos This seems to be fixed in https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/abb17bc7f0985c0b5eaa85ead7351e5c74a731f8. Published v9.2.4 with the fixes.. You can use fillOpacity and strokeOpacity for now. Or fix the type definition. Could add it to: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/72a53f373028e4c1d89286c1e6c93c7a229ebc90/index.d.ts#L158\nExcept that it shouldn't apply to the mask element.. Oh, I had missed that v0.57.0 bumps it to v3.1.4, can probably change to that.. Seems this exposes quite a few bugs in both implementations.\nThis works a bit at least, though still very buggy: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/Y291cm\nUsed https://svgr.now.sh/ and then did a search & replace from \"xlinkHref\" to \"href\" and removed the url() wrapping the id in the mask attributes. . Actually, it seems android renders correctly, it's the conversion which breaks it, or at least chrome renders the same when used with svgs: https://codesandbox.io/s/0k078q4yl\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport { Svg, Defs, Circle, Path, G, Mask, Use } from \"svgs\";\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nReactDOM.render(, rootElement);\n```. @zek This seems to work on android at least: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/c3B1bm\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\n// You can import from local files\nimport AssetExample from './components/AssetExample';\n// or any pure javascript modules available in npm\nimport { Card } from 'react-native-paper';\nconst { Defs, Circle, Path, G, Mask, Use, Rect } = Svg;\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```. Seems the fill values aren't inherited from the Mask element, once I inlined the fill values into the elements inside the Masks it worked.. Not sure, can you try changing the fill in the masks I changed from white to black? it might fix it, if it does then i think i know where to look.. Yeah, just noticed the same. Great!. So, bugs to fix:\n- [x] handle svg root width/height attribute strings containing px on iOS\n- [x] inherit fill/stroke attributes from Mask elements\n- [x] set default bounding box of mask to fill viewport / allow missing x, y, width, height on mask element. Great. There is already quite significant support for iOS in the filters branch: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/filters\nIt's being tracked here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/150\nBut, haven't started implementing android yet, and that will probably require adding RenderScript, which adds a manual one time step to get it to build on android, which might be a bit much to ask for.\nThen again, it seems like the best way to do things regarding performance/energy use on android.\nAnyway, I'm very busy with work atm, and not sure when I'll have time to work on this.\nIdeally, with the new fabric rewrite of react-native, we would generate a native svg rendering library interface from the WebIDL spec of svg 2.0 to cover the entire api, use a rust implementation for processing (https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg) and rasterizing it (https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder or https://github.com/nical/lyon), and merely make a small c++ wrapper and java + objective-c glue (and c#, kotlin, dart, python, ruby etc. to get more platforms perhaps) for it, such that it can be used from react-native, as well as any other native environment, with a single cross-platform, efficient, memory and thread safe implementation. Having the WebIDL specified api would allow much of the existing js which runs against svg implementations in the browsers to work almost straight away. And, give an escape hatch around the async bridge.. @kristerkari @zek seems the output from svgr works without modification with the latest commit in the master branch. Can you try it out please?. Hmm, I just tried checking out that project, installed react-native-svg 9.0.4, and it seems to work on iOS, is there anything extra I need to change?. @kristerkari Did you rebuild the native code? I have a hunch you're using the new javascript with the old native code..

This issue probably belongs in the react-native repo, but the issue has already been fixed and the patch will be included in react-native v0.58:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4dfdec9b28074b311ffd75084d9d2a3cbd41a800#diff-409fd490b233c234fcd355cf00a9a0dc\nYou can ask them to cherry pick it for the next 0.57 release if they're planning any more of those.. Seems like a workaround is to wrap the second map over the children inside a G element: https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts/blob/3309d13476707477d5c06ec8f0e50b6bfa4dc129/src/chart.js#L126-L133\nAlso, moving the Path element to the end of the Svg element removes the error: https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts/blob/3309d13476707477d5c06ec8f0e50b6bfa4dc129/src/chart.js#L119-L125\nOr, alternatively, removing the Gradient from the AreaChart.jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  Text,\n  View,\n  TouchableWithoutFeedback,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Dimensions,\n  Animated,\n  Platform,\n} from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, {\n  Defs,\n  LinearGradient,\n  Stop,\n  RadialGradient,\n  G,\n  Path,\n  Circle,\n  Rect,\n  ClipPath,\n  Symbol,\n  Use,\n  Image,\n  Text as SvgText,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nimport { AreaChart, XAxis, YAxis } from 'react-native-svg-charts';\nimport * as scale from 'd3-scale';\nimport * as shape from 'd3-shape';\nimport moment from 'moment';\nconst contentInset = { top: 30, bottom: 30 };\nconst SpeciesChart = ({ data }) => {\n  const formatXAxis = index => {\n    const allMonths = moment.monthsShort();\n    if (index === 0 || index % 2 === 0) {\n      return '      ' + allMonths[index];\n    }\n  };\nconst Line = ({ line }) => (\n    \n  );\nconst Gradient = ({ index }) => (\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  );\nreturn (\n    \n item.count}\n        contentInset={contentInset}\n        svg={{ fontSize: 10, fill: 'white' }}\n        min={0}\n        numberOfTicks={8}\n      />\n      \n item.count}\n          xAccessor={({ item }) => item.month}\n          xScale={scale.scaleTime}\n          yScale={scale.scaleLinear}\n          contentInset={contentInset}\n          curve={shape.curveNatural}\n          style={{ flex: 1 }}\n          svg={{ fill: 'url(#gradient)' }}\n        >\n          \n\n\n item.month}\n          formatLabel={value => formatXAxis(value - 1)}\n          svg={{\n            fontSize: 10,\n            fill: 'white',\n          }}\n        />\n      \n\n  );\n};\nconst data = [\n  { month: 1, count: 3 },\n  { month: 2, count: 4 },\n  { month: 3, count: 5 },\n  { month: 4, count: 3 },\n  { month: 5, count: 4 },\n  { month: 6, count: 5 },\n  { month: 7, count: 3 },\n  { month: 8, count: 4 },\n  { month: 9, count: 5 },\n  { month: 10, count: 3 },\n  { month: 11, count: 4 },\n  { month: 12, count: 5 },\n];\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = { scale: 1 };\n  render() {\n    const { scale } = this.state;\n    return (\n       this.setState({ scale: scale === 1 ? 2 : 1 })}\n      >\n        \n ({ ...d, count: d.count * scale }))}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: 'black',\n  },\n});\n```. @wmonecke I would need more reproductions to analyze this further. Other than that it seems there exists workaround. So, seems relatively fine as no one else has provided broken examples yet.. I've traced this down to #755 \nIf you want to use the latest code, and are willing to accept the tradeoff, you can use the fix_manage_children branch where I've reverted the cause of this, until a proper workaround can be found: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23350. Published v9.2.4 with a fix. Can you please test it?. Hmm, what do you mean? Can you show an example using plain svg? . Draw the text twice, once with the stroke, and once without stroke on top of it.. @renato-bvdash This seems to work fine:\njsx\n<Svg width=\"20\" height=\"27\">\n  <Defs>\n    <Polygon id=\"b\" points=\"0 0 16 0 16 23 7.82151442 14.698999 0 23\" />\n  </Defs>\n  <G fill=\"none\">\n    <G transform=\"translate(2 1)\">\n      <Use fill=\"#000\" href=\"#b\" />\n      <Use fill=\"#FFC944\" href=\"#b\" />\n    </G>\n    <Path\n      fill=\"#FFF\"\n      stroke=\"#FFC944\"\n      d=\"M10.117 13.123l-2.61 1.373c-.977.513-1.617.046-1.43-1.04l.498-2.906-2.112-2.058c-.79-.77-.544-1.524.546-1.682l2.919-.424 1.305-2.644c.488-.99 1.28-.989 1.768 0l1.305 2.644 2.918.424c1.092.159 1.336.912.547 1.682l-2.112 2.058.498 2.906c.187 1.088-.455 1.552-1.43 1.04l-2.61-1.373z\"\n    />\n  </G>\n</Svg>\nCan be reduced to this:\njsx\nexport default () => (\n  <Svg width=\"20\" height=\"27\">\n    <Polygon\n      fill=\"#FFC944\"\n      transform=\"translate(2 1)\"\n      points=\"0 0 16 0 16 23 7.82151442 14.698999 0 23\"\n    />\n    <Path\n      fill=\"#FFF\"\n      stroke=\"#FFC944\"\n      d=\"M10.117 13.123l-2.61 1.373c-.977.513-1.617.046-1.43-1.04l.498-2.906-2.112-2.058c-.79-.77-.544-1.524.546-1.682l2.919-.424 1.305-2.644c.488-.99 1.28-.989 1.768 0l1.305 2.644 2.918.424c1.092.159 1.336.912.547 1.682l-2.112 2.058.498 2.906c.187 1.088-.455 1.552-1.43 1.04l-2.61-1.373z\"\n    />\n  </Svg>\n);. Hmm, that seems to work just fine for me. I'll close this for now. Is this still an issue for you with the latest version?. Can you try this change? https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts/pull/280/files. Please provide a full replication if you want progress on this. ?. @msageryd I think the scaling might be related to this:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/e74ff2b3a3c6aee7c501bd3a230de165b0b15ab6/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/SvgView.java#L67\nIt'll probably be different with different devices/emulators depending on the screen density\nCould probably take the density into consideration when creating the bitmap, and add a scaling matrix to the canvas, before rendering:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/e74ff2b3a3c6aee7c501bd3a230de165b0b15ab6/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/SvgView.java#L293-L305. Try perhaps something like this:\n```java\n    String toDataURL() {\n        float invScale = 1f / mScale;\n        Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(\n                Math.round(getWidth() * invScale),\n                Math.round(getHeight() * invScale),\n                Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n    Canvas c = new Canvas(bitmap);\n    c.scale(invScale, invScale);\n    drawChildren(c);\n    ByteArrayOutputStream stream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n    bitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 100, stream);\n    bitmap.recycle();\n    byte[] bitmapBytes = stream.toByteArray();\n    return Base64.encodeToString(bitmapBytes, Base64.DEFAULT);\n}\n\n```. The scaling call might actually causing another extra scaling, accounting for it in the bitmap size might be enough.. These changes are for android not ios, you need to rebuild in android studio instead of xcode. And, i haven't tested these changes. I think for now at least, unless we want to make a major version jump, if we want to make any changes here we need to keep them backwards compatible. We could perhaps introduce a parameter, to say that you want a downscaled version rather than the scaled bitmap size.. I've implemented support for an optional second argument to the toDataURL method, as an options object parameter having a width and height property. Would this cover your needs?\nIt's available in the toDataURL branch \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/toDataURL\ndiff: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/text-anchor-subtree-calculation...toDataURL?expand=1\nExample:\njsx\n        <Svg\n          ref={ele => {\n            ele.toDataURL(\n              res => {\n                console.log(res);\n              },\n              {\n                width: 100,\n                height: 100,\n              },\n            );\n          }}\n          width=\"100%\"\n          height=\"100%\"\n          viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"\n        >. Would be great to validate the implementation before merging and releasing it at least. I haven't opened the output or drawn it on screen yet, only made sure that it gives output on both ios and android so far.. @msageryd Can you try with the develop branch? I think i have it working correctly now:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, Image } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nclass SvgComponent extends Component {\n  state = {};\n  onRef = ref => {\n    if (ref && !this.state.base64) {\n      ref.toDataURL(\n        base64 => {\n          this.setState({ base64 });\n        },\n        { width: 200, height: 200 },\n      );\n    }\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n          {this.state.base64 && (\n            data:image/png;base64,${this.state.base64} }}\n              style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }}\n            />\n          )}\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default SvgComponent;\n. Btw, I've added support for calling toDataUrl already in the ref function, don't have to wait for onLayout in javascript anymore.. This sounds quite strange, relatively little has changed in the code since v9.2.4\nThere's three main changes, the toDataUrl with options, vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke, work on text alignment, and then there has been some minor js optimizations. My first suspect would probably be the text logic changes.\nBut nothing should have changed when the rendering happens. Possibly there is more reuse of memory and objects, causing some setter not to call invalidate in case the values are equal already. But seems that should've been true from before as well.\nWould you be able to create a minimal reproduction of the issues?. I'll probably need to port the logic from android to ios, for handling the case where not all your content is rendered yet. Android needed it even for small amounts of content, the view creation commands would be in the queue when toDataUrl gets called, and even putting it in the end of the queue then wasn't enough. So it needs to be queued to happen only when the rendering is actually done.. Can you try with v9.2.5 ?. Please provide a full replication. Closing until then.. @jsamr How about something like this?\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@msand/native-animation-rotationjsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet, Animated, Platform } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Path, Rect, G } = Svg;\nconst AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path);\nconst AnimatedG = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(G);\nexport class TestLogo extends Component {\n  state = {\n    rotation: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\nstopAnimation() {\n    this.state.rotation.stopAnimation();\n    this.setState({ rotation: new Animated.Value(0) });\n  }\nstartAnimation() {\n    Animated.loop(\n      Animated.timing(this.state.rotation, {\n        useNativeDriver: true,\n        duration: 3000,\n        toValue: 1,\n      })\n    ).start();\n  }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.startAnimation();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const width = 100;\n    const offsetAndroid = Platform.OS === 'android' ? width / 2 : 0;\n    const [pivotX, pivotY] = [25, 25];\n    return (\n      -${pivotX} -${pivotY} 50 50}>\n        \n\ntranslate(-${pivotX} -${pivotY})}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n``. If you can make a PR and show an example of how this simplifies things then we can surely consider it. Are there any other react-native modules using this pattern?. Yes, but react-native has a bunch of c/c++ code which would require installing the ndk, and a 20minute build just to get started otherwise. Building this library tends to take a few seconds. So I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. I haven't seen it done by any other module. But please do make the change so we can measure and compare.. I guess this can be closed. Or are you still looking into this? @wokkaflokka . @wokkaflokka Interesting, thanks for looking into it! I think in our case, it might actually be helpful that people can merely change the source in node_modules in attempts to find fixes to issues, rebuild, verify and open a pr.\nWith regards to the source set, I think that is decided by https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli \nI'm not sure what are all the effects your suggested changes would have, could you explain what are the differences?. @ltegman Interesting, are you saying you have gradle task runningyarn install` as a command-line, to avoid having android developers run an additional command? I guess this applies even in a plain react-native project without any extra modules then? Or how would you have anything in node_modules otherwise?. Hmm, I'd rather have this fixed on the native side, such that setNativeProps can give either a plain number or a string with units. @kristerkari Would you be willing to make changes on the native side instead?. Would need to add support for (numeric) font-weights with values 1-1000\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a/ios/Text/RNSVGFontData.m#L71-L72\nAnd set it here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a/ios/Text/RNSVGTSpan.m#L238-L260\nUsing\nkCTFontVariationAttribute ios(3.2)\nand perhaps\nkCTFontFeatureSettingsAttribute ios(3.2)\nAnd on Android:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/FontData.java#L94\nAnd using setFontVariationSettings on Android O (version 26) and up,\nto set it somewhere around here (before or after): https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/2f513504d21a8138ac851784b3b110ccb8cceb3a/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanView.java#L256-L266\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvaroverview\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide\nhttps://medium.com/over-engineering/variable-fonts-in-android-p-c5c918275646\nhttps://webkit.org/blog/7051/variable-fonts-on-the-web/\nhttps://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/creating-a-variable-font. Alternatively, just adding some logic to round any number between 1-1000 to the closest discrete font-weight, (and/or clamp any numbers outside the range), and mapping that to the corresponding enum would be fine for now as well. What do you think @kristerkari ?. Of course, we could also just merge this first, and make those enhancements in other PRs. Might be that animating the font-weight using the native driver would be quite niche/rare in practise. And, it would probably be quite intensive computationally for any significant number of even medium complexity glyphs . Yep, would work, and apparently fractions as well. But, only with OpenType fonts which are made to support it though. There's a demo of variable font-weights in e.g. this page, the third one there has a slider below it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide#Weight\nSeems that the CSS Fonts Module Level 4 defines it:\nEach number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. Only values greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 1000, are valid, and all other values are invalid.\nhttps://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-weight-numeric-values\nhttps://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-weight-prop\nAnd close to the end:\nFor TrueType / OpenType fonts that use variations, the wght variation is used to implement varying weights. Fractional weights are valid.. @kristerkari Hey, finally got back to looking at this, sorry for taking so much time. \n\nWe can either add another data-structure, or another enum value to signify variable fonts weights together with a member in FontData called fontWeightNumeric of type double. Then in the property parsing, instead of assuming that it's a string, it would check if it's a number, and in that case check that it's in the correct interval, set the enum to variable and store the weight, or fallback to default in case of validation errors.\nSimilarly if it's a string and none of the enums match, it should check if the string can be parsed as a double in (1, 1000) and store the value. Alternatively, something like a FontWeightValue object/class could be defined, to contain the enum, the double, the parsing logic & getters. And then the fontFeatureSetting logic would check if the weight is variable, and in that case set wght to the given value.\n\nI wish we had this written in rust at this point, it could represent this very nicely. Or, union types / algebraic data types in java/obj-c wouldn't hurt either.\n\nLately I've been setting up e2e testing over here: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-e2e\nIt works already, but is not in any way complete or optimized yet. Otherwise there's the example git submodule in this repo, but that hasn't been updated for a long time. And then I have a collection of random examples I've used in development and debugging, but there's no proper testing yet, or any collection of blessed reference screenshots to compare to. The web-platform-tests group has some good material, which we could probably use with your transformer to be able to test significant amounts of logic and spec conformance. But that should probably run locally, it would likely cause timeouts in any free CI system.\nFor this case, I think a single text element with some text, and either a slider or textinput or buttons, to be able to set the font-weight to various values, or even just rendering two-three examples with the same text but different weight and no interactions/state would but perfectly fine as tests. A screenshot showing what some text looks like with default, minimum and maximum font-weight should cover most of the things which could break.. @kristerkari Are you still interested in working on this? Would be much appreciated \u2764\ufe0f . This might be good inspiration: https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/427003210b3e16a82f958e35ff4212f26ffa35ab/components/style/values/specified/font.rs#L71-L193. Also: https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/8de1b8d3f4d0e814980a1f7836a9e865e0d0f53b/components/style/values/computed/font.rs#L112-L138. Great to hear! Btw, I intend to merge the vector-effect branch today, it includes a commit to support native animation of font size: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/9b1ccf0e7f5b5d4e4e7dc22082e8fce63cca9be1 \nIt might be useful to get similar support for the font-weight\nBut, at least I'll need to fix the toDataUrl functionality before I merge and publish it, it's getting support for an optional options parameter, where one can specify the size of the canvas used for making the png.. As a side-note. Kotlin would have when expressions, and swift has a more general case statement, but not worth changing language to get it, they perform worse than java and obj-c in general in both compile and run time. For java there's also http://www.vavr.io/vavr-docs/#_the_basics_of_match_for_java but not worth bringing in a dependency, just to simplify a single if statement with regards to handling computations of a single data structure / enum / sum type. When/if a cross-platform rust rewrite would be done, it would make more sense, as it can be more performant and safe than java, kotlin, swift or obj-c anyway and handles it syntactically clearer than any of them.. Found a nice example of animating font-weight here: https://alligator.io/css/variable-fonts/. I started work on the text layout algoritm from svg 2.0 long ago, but never got around to finishing it. If you want multiline text, you either have to do it manually using text/tspan elements and the x and y attributes, or, wrap the svg in a view, and position react native text elements absolutely positioned where you want them.\nOr, help out implementing the layout: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TextLayoutAlgorithm.java. You can also use onLayout or UIManager.measure to get the width and height of the text.. @stephenkopylov What was the complication you found? Not sure I remember all the related issues to this. Think there's something with press/gesture handling related to it.. Is this even causing any memory leaks? At least when I animate svg content the memory seems to stay flat, similarly if a svg element is rendered and removed based on a flag. Can probably close this, unless an actual memory leak as been found. Please comment if that is the case.. At least all leaks I've found are fixed at this point. If you're able to find any others, please open a new issue. Thanks for reporting!. Seems your node_modules are corrupted. Try removing them and npm install again. . Not sure what would cause that, but unrelated to this library at least. Closing for now.. Can you provide a full replication?. @FibreFoX That seems to work fine for me in both android and ios. Closing this until a reproduction is available.. Published v8.0.9. We should probably add some null checks after the lookup of mask, and only do the masking logic if the referenced element actually exists.. We already have support for alignment-baseline and baseline-shift, I'm not completely sure I understand all of what implementing support for dominant-baseline entails. Do you have any example content?\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#BaselineAlignmentProperties\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#DominantBaselineProperty\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#AlignmentBaselineProperty\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#BaselineShiftProperty\n\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#DominantBaselineProperty\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#AlignmentBaselineProperty\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#BaselineShiftProperty\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#line-height\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-dominant-baseline\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-alignment-baseline\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-baseline-shift\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#line-height\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#vertical-align\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#baseline\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#AlignmentBaselineType\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#BaselineAlignmentOverview\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#dominant-baseline\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#alignment-baseline\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#alignment-adjust\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#baseline-shift\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#vertical-align\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/#BaselineUsage\nhttps://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/859\nThe time I'm currently able to put into working on this library is relatively limited for the time being. I'm focusing more on fixing bugs and implementing features which otherwise aren't possible. Seems the use case for dominant-baseline can be achieved by setting alignment-baseline and baseline-shift per tspan element which needs it, and should mostly be an issue when combining several fonts and font-sizes. Or have I misunderstood the use of the attribute? (fully possible, haven't seen it in use yet)\nIf you're interested in having support for this, the relevant parts of the logic is in (iOS)\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6df918356b5df6cde98b78560b3e889199bd67a4/ios/Text/RNSVGTSpan.m#L479-L671\nand (Android)\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6df918356b5df6cde98b78560b3e889199bd67a4/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/TSpanView.java#L479-L674. Try upgrading to react-native 0.57.4 or newer https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/806#issuecomment-431452253. Well, that's just up to you. Alternatively you can apply the patch to the version of rn you are using and build it yourself (requires ndk) . @devmark88 It's a native exception so probably not. Closing, as it's a bug in react-native, and fixed in the latest versions.. Strange, we don't depend on that library, and can't see it in any of my android projects. I guess this is a fluke and related to something else. Or can you provide a git repo as reproduction? @zim-lee . Seems you're out of space on your device/emulator.. Can you try with plain react-native and the latest version of react-native-svg? Several gesture related bugs have been fixed recently. E.g. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/821. What OS are you on? \nCan you run react-native info inside your project root? \nHave you done all the parts in https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html ?\nIf you're on mac, perhaps try something like:\nhttps://github.com/fwh1990/react-native-init\nit can:\n\n1\u3001Create project based on react-native-cli.\n2\u3001Download android sdk automatically without android studio.\n3\u3001Create android emulator automatically without android studio.\n4\u3001Run npm start can launch android & ios simulator automatically.\n5\u3001Build android & ios app by shell script automatically.\n6\u3001Upload ios app to app-store by shell script automatically.\n7\u3001You don't need to care about how to install any more, just focus to write javascript code.\n\nOtherwise check here if you're on linux: https://shift.infinite.red/painless-react-native-setup-for-mac-windows-linux-39e2e4d58d89\nor windows: https://shift.infinite.red/painless-react-native-setup-for-mac-windows-linux-99d099a1f942. Or actually, with your attitude, it might be wiser to stop trying and change jobs. I'm not sure coding will ever feel satisfying or fit a person who writes like you did. Will probably save both yourself and others a lot of suffering..

Yeah, you'll need to wait for them to update to the latest code. At least it seems fine with the latest master branch, released versions, and release candidates; of react-native and react-native-svg. Reopen if otherwise.. I'm unable to replicate this with v9 at least. Could you make a cloneable git repo (with v9) where i can just install and run to see the issue.. @SaeedZhiany @ReggaePanda Think I managed to replicate and fix this. Can you test with v9.2.3?. Nesting native components inside Svg hasn't really been specified anywhere yet. foreignObject is probably the thing to implement to make the nested components take the current transform matrix into account. I would just place the native components using position: absolute, and place them outside the  svg root such that the normal react-native layout can do it's thing. Alternatively, use native transform to move it around.. This is unrelated to this library, if you have a repro, please post it to the issue in the react native repo instead. . The filters branch has ios support to some degree already, check this issue: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/150. Fixed in master branch:\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Defs, LinearGradient, Stop, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst AnimatedStop = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Stop);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    anim: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\n  componentDidMount = () => {\n    Animated.timing(this.state.anim, {\n      duration: 3000,\n      toValue: 1,\n    }).start();\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```. How about something like this? https://snack.expo.io/@msand/non-scaling-stroke-work-around\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Path } = Svg;\nexport function LeftField({ scale = 1, xScaleFactor = scale, yScaleFactor = scale }) {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n  );\n}\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n``. @scottmas Then how aboutpreserveAspectRatio=\"none\"`?. Oh, now I got you, was a bit confused when you weren't even using stroke in your example.. All the logic is in house, we only use what is exposed by the operating systems. I think this would require applying the current transform matrix (CTM) to the path, and applying the inverse to the CTM (to make it the identity transform), before filling and stroking it, and restore the rendering context to the previous state as usual. Not completely sure if this covers all of it, but at least from thinking about it for a few minutes I haven't come up with anything it wouldn't cover.. @scottmas Would you be willing to work on this? Are you more familiar with java or objective-c?. @scottmas I've implemented it for Android here, could you try it out? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/ffb04c84143c506a6f5cde8bb97ff9fab09d1595\nSo, the iOS implementation is missing, and mainly consists of porting the changes from RenderableView.java android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableView.java\n to RNSVGRenderable.m react-native-svg/ios/RNSVGRenderable.m\nAnd then, exposing the setter for vectorEffects in RNSVGRenderableManager.m react-native-svg/ios/ViewManagers/RNSVGRenderableManager.m the same way as in RenderableViewManager.java android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/RenderableViewManager.java. Working on the iOS version requires no changes on your part, if you're already able to open your react-native project in xcode and start it from there. Just make modifications to the obj-c files in the ios folder of react-native-svg, and rebuild to test the changes.. @scottmas Implemented ios here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/1b050834d5c4a8410054bbdbe18470c561325349\nCan you try the vector-effect branch?. Tested using this:\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Rect, G, Line } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n      <G transform=\"scale(9,1)\">\n        <Line\n          stroke=\"black\"\n          strokeWidth=\"5\"\n          x1=\"10\"\n          y1=\"50\"\n          x2=\"10\"\n          y2=\"350\"\n        />\n        <Line\n          vectorEffect=\"non-scaling-stroke\"\n          stroke=\"black\"\n          strokeWidth=\"5\"\n          x1=\"32\"\n          y1=\"50\"\n          x2=\"32\"\n          y2=\"350\"\n        />\n        <Line\n          vectorEffect=\"none\"\n          stroke=\"black\"\n          strokeWidth=\"5\"\n          x1=\"55\"\n          y1=\"50\"\n          x2=\"55\"\n          y2=\"350\"\n        />\n      </G>\n    </Svg>\n  </View>\n);\n\n}\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```\nios: \n\nandroid: \n\n. Oh, forgot to add the header file for ios: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/014e2375fa4b73feb98cea3a4d69700c4df32514. @scottmas You can even make the changes and a pr here in github if you're interested: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/edit/vector-effect/index.d.ts\nOtherwise, click the fork button, clone the repo, make the changes, commit, push to your own repo, and open a pr, would be the normal workflow for larger commits.. @scottmas Could you check that hitTesting/onPress behaves as you would expect? especially edge cases (a little bit inside or outside the filled paint or stroke).. I suspect the points will need to be transformed a similar amount as the paths, but not sure how all this will interact, would have to do some testing and read/step thru some of the code again.. Could probably just store the coordinates when the hitTest logic enters the Svg root, and use those when deciding if paths with nonScalingStroke have the points inside their paint regions or not.. This might be because of the rendering model used in iOS vs Android. iOS has premultiplied alpha values in the color, while on android the opacity is multiplied on traversal of the child graph. It may be that this is a bit too expensive to fix, if it requires rendering the layers separately and compositing them. But, it might also be something relatively trivial. Feel free to investigate. Not prioritizing this atm at least.. Check e.g. https://twitter.com/kzzzf/status/1075450658050977792. The parser in ios merely keeps parsing the matches of the regular expression, interpreting the second S as a number (resulting in 0), thus giving the first S four values anyway. Then fallback logic interprets another S command incorrectly, ignoring the last line command (L interpreted as number again). It just happens that the values you've used gives the same output, in general this won't be true. Ideally the parser would be stricter and just choke on incorrect inputs, giving an error rather than give the impression that what was given would be a valid path data string.. The error message explains exactly what is wrong, you're trying to add an svg group (G element) to a react native view, you need to wrap it in a Svg root element instead. Same as using svg in the web. . What you're attempting to do isn't part of the spec yet, they're called conical gradients, and you need a polyfill http://leaverou.github.io/conic-gradient/ on the web\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/#conic-gradients\nAnd in react-native-svg you'll need to create create some other structure yourself to emulate it, check how others have done it with svg or canvas for the web. . Seems to me that the bottom middle is opposite to the jump in colors, if you split that image in half (along the middle so you get a left and a right half) you can use two gradients and paths, one with yellow to orange (from top to bottom) for the right half, and one with orange to red (from bottom to top) for the left half. . Make a quick experiment to create conical gradients with react-native-svg: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/conical-gradient-experiment\nbased on https://css-houdini.rocks/posts/conic-gradient/paint.js. Fixed in v9. This seems to work fine at least: https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg-example/blob/5a972149f22e0464152d487e6aab015a368ba02a/examples/Svg.js#L153-L185.

You need to rebuild the native code, which cannot be done with expo without ejecting first. You'll need to use plain react-native, or wait for expo to upgrade.. And yes, testing both platforms:\n\n. Have you tried upgrading jsc? https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts. Only thing that comes to mind that would be easy to optimize with regards to startup time, would be to generate the transform parser at build time to a separate file, and import that instead of generating it at runtime: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6f256f1da142b6ab4eb0bd1422883aae5db5e3f3/lib/extract/extractTransform.js#L18. Do the android devices you're testing have comparable hardware to the ios devices you're testing? If you compare cheap / low end android to expensive / high end ios devices you can expect performance differences for sure. Also, the rendering pipeline and architecture varies among devices, hardware/os version combinations etc. I would recommend optimizing with e.g. svgo, and profiling the code to find bottlenecks, and attempt to implement equivalent or similar enough output using cheaper rendering primitives and improve reuse/caching. Hard to give more specific suggestions without access to the actual code. . @defualt I tried removing lodash and compiling the parser in development instead of run-time. I haven't tested it yet, but though you might be interested in trying it out: \nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/optimize_startup\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/optimize_startup. @default have you been able to measure any difference? Can't really find anything else to simplify at this point without changing the interface / semantics. Would need to profile the parse and first execution time in more detail to find any potential optimization targets. But having read the code several times, nothing pops out as having big potential gains at this point. The next step would be to move all the logic from js to the native side. But, that might not happen until a rewrite in rust or something or the changes coming with the fabric rewrite. . @brentvatne @ide I think you might be interested in this, if you want to shave off 500+ms from starting expo apps (which are using react-native-svg) on low end devices. Perhaps something to consider for the next version.. v9.0.0 has been released with these changes and various spec conformance fixes included. . @msageryd Could you try this branch to check for any regressions?. Related to https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/894\nSpeeds up startup on e.g. low-end android devices by 500+ ms\nShould improve rendering performance as well (on android at least, much more extensive caching in use now). Ah ok. Well, I'm relatively confident the js code changes shouldn't break anything. But good get a bit more testing of it anyway. . @msageryd I tried porting the caching logic to iOS now as well, available in the latest commit. Needs regression testing, and validation that it actually improves performance.. Also, the memory retention needs to be analyzed.. I think this might be ready for a release candidate to npm now. Unless someone finds a bug/regression.. @msageryd Alright, great. As long as there's no noticeable regression of performance it should be fine. The improvements are probably mostly noticeable if a Svg element has several G elements with lots of content, but only one/a few of the groups get changed. In this case, it should be able to reuse the Path objects representing the unchanged groups. But splitting things into separate Svg roots, if they have different update frequencies, should still be faster. As it can reuse the entire bitmap/raster output in those cases and just do the composition using the normal view rendering.\nCan you try the latest commit? It should fix handling of Use in iOS.\n. @msageryd Do you have any example where it renders different from normal svg use on the web? At least https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/646#issuecomment-381366800 seems to render the same in the browser, ios and android for me now.. \n```jsx\nexport default class App extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n\n\n\n\n            <Rect\n                x=\"0\"\n                y=\"0\"\n                width=\"100\"\n                height=\"100\"\n                stroke=\"blue\"\n                fill=\"none\"\n            />\n            <Use\n                href=\"#symbol\"\n                x=\"0\"\n                y=\"0\"\n                width=\"20\"\n                height=\"20\"\n                transform=\"rotate(45, 10, 10)\"\n            />\n            <Use\n                href=\"#symbol\"\n                x=\"40\"\n                y=\"40\"\n                width=\"20\"\n                height=\"20\"\n                transform=\"rotate(-45, 10, 10)\"\n            />\n            <Use\n                href=\"#symbol\"\n                x=\"0\"\n                y=\"80\"\n                width=\"20\"\n                height=\"20\"\n                transform=\"rotate(-45, 10, 90)\"\n            />\n        </Svg>\n    );\n}\n\n}\n. @msageryd Hmm, I wonder if you might be running the new native code but with the old javascript, this could cause the x and y translation to be applied twice.. @msageryd Perhaps something like this might help:sh\nwatchman watch-del-all && rm -rf $TMPDIR/react- && rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro && rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-*\nreact-native run-ios --reset-cache\n```. These are actually for clearing the javascript cache, seems your native code had updated correctly, but used the old javascript for the react-native-svg module.\nThe origin of the Use element should be that of the containing element.\nThus e.g. in this content:\n```html\n    \n\n\n\n  <g transform=\"translate(20, 20)\">\n    <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"blue\" fill=\"none\" strokeWidth=\"1\" />\n    <use href=\"#symbol\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" transform=\"rotate(45, 10, 10)\" />\n    <use href=\"#symbol\" x=\"40\" y=\"40\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" transform=\"rotate(-45, 10, 10)\" />\n    <use href=\"#symbol\" x=\"0\" y=\"80\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" transform=\"rotate(-45, 10, 90)\" />\n  </g>\n</svg>\n\n```\nyou need to set the origin of the rotation using the optional x and y parameters of the rotate transform.\nSo, the non translated use element (all of which have width and height of 20 units), needs the origin at 10,10 to rotate about the center of it. And the use elements which have non-zero x or y attributes, need a different rotate definition to account for the translation.. Alright, great. Will do.. That syntax is probably more efficient (but non-standard / not part of the svg spec), as it is already in object form, while the string needs to be parsed using the transform parser. Otherwise they should be equivalent with regards to input/output. \nThe only remaining question now is if this should be a major, minor or patch version. There is certainly potential for breaking changes, so I guess it should be a major one, although the affected users might be relatively few. Just hope it doesn't scare people away from updating.. Oh, and btw, the bounds, center and frame calculation should fix the display of bounding boxes when using the inspector / standalone React Native Debugger, and it should improve pan responder and touch handling in several cases.. True. Actually I already released v9.0.0\nAlthough the potential for breaking change is relatively minor, it still changes the semantics/effects of the Use element x, y, and transform attributes. It's mostly in consideration of any user(s) who might have thought it was behaving correctly and found values which work for them using trial and error rather than using the standard / specified behavior of svg. . Although, the specific numbers used in the semver are quite irrelevant. they do have some psychological effect as well. Sometimes positive, sometimes negative. At least there hasn't been any significant frequency of major version changes, so seems like it's worth following the semver spec in this case.. Hmm, haven't seen that with font sizes. Could you make a repro? . Btw, the changes for numeric handling of font-size was related to animating the font-size with useNativeDriver: true. From the article you link to:\n\nAs such the compile dependency has been deprecated and replaced by two new ones:\napi: you leak the interface of this module through your own interface, meaning exactly the same as the old compile dependency\nimplementation: you only use this module internally and does not leak it through your interface\n\nIt seems correct to use implementation rather than api, afaik we do not leak the react-native api from the interface we expose, and I don't know about any native module which would depend on our interface anyway, so I think this couldn't even have any potential effect on anything at all.. Btw, why the CAPS? Are you screaming these words inside your head when you write/read them?. Can you try upgrading react-native to 0.57.4 or newer? .

Docs have been updated: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#use-with-svg-files\nWith react-native-svg-transformer you can now do this:\njsx\nimport Logo from \"./logo.svg\";\nconst myApp = () => <Logo width={120} height={40} />\nexport default myApp. It uses SVGR under the hood, and it produces components looking like this:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Svg, { Path } from 'react-native-svg'\n/ SVGR has dropped some elements not supported by react-native-svg: title /\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n)\nexport default SvgComponent\nSo, if you have elements where you haven't defined fill or stroke, then they'll inherit from their ancestors, and if you give a value to the SvgComponent, it'll give it to the Svg root and thus inherit from there. There is also the color property you can use in addition to stroke and fill, and it can be referenced using the `currentColor` value: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#svg. You need to rebuild the native bundle, have you ejected from expo? . Linking shouldn't be necessary if you already have v8 linked. Breaking changes should be limited to spec conformance fixes of:\nSkew/skewx/skewy as plain attributes or as part of a transform object (transform strings were already conforming)\nUse elements with x or y attributes or as part of a transform object\n. Unable to replicate in v9.0.1 with this at least:jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { G, Text, TSpan, Svg } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n{' '}\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```. Did you rebuild the native bundle? Can't replicate it yet at least. Can you try v9.0.3?. Here's an even simpler example:\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Svg, Text, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default () => (\n  \n\n \n\n);\n```. Nope, its still only in the master branch, haven't cut any new release yet. . Released v9.0.3, can you try with that?\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Text } from 'react-native-svg';\nimport { loadFont } from 'react-native-dynamic-fonts';\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    fontFamily: '',\n  };\n  componentDidMount = () => {\n    loadFont('SpaceMono-Regular', base64FontString, 'ttf').then(fontFamily => {\n      console.log('Loaded font successfully. Font name is: ', fontFamily);\n      this.setState({ fontFamily });\n    });\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\nTesting\n\n            Testing\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles =

Published v9.0.1. Did you upgrade and rebuild the native bundle? . Can you provide a full replication?. A few minor changes needed, stroke was missing and viewport needs to be viewBox instead:jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\nconst { concat, multiply } = Animated;\nconst x = multiply(1, 2);\nconst y = multiply(2, 3);\nconst path = concat('M 0 0 L ', x, ' ', y);\nconst AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path);\nconst DemoComponent = () => (\n  \n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```\nBut otherwise seems to work fine, with no changes needed to the library.. Android required a bit of modification in reanimated, check my pull request here: https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated/pull/176. Also, wrote a small tagged template literal function:\n```js\nfunction animatedString(strings, ...values) {\n  const arr = [];\n  const n = values.length;\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    arr.push(strings[i], values[i]);\n  }\n  const end = strings[n];\n  if (end) {\n    arr.push(end);\n  }\n  return concat(...arr);\n}\nconst path = animatedStringM0,0 L${x},${y};\n```. 1. You're using Expo v26, the oldest available, no error in the latest version v32\n2. You need to render something and set the fill or stroke of that to reference your gradient if you want it to render\n3. You need to set stopColor for the stops in the gradient\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@msand/bGluZW\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Defs, LinearGradient, Stop, Rect, Path, G } = Svg;\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n```. Can you provide a full replication? Perhaps try with a  inside the clipPath?. @bmcn99 how about transform=\"scale(2)\" or scale={2} ?. Perhaps can wrap it inside another Svg element, and set the size on that? I'm not sure I understand the question. Executable code / an example would make it easier. @pgnedoy At least this seems to work fine:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Svg, {\n    Image,\n    Defs,\n    Circle,\n    ClipPath,\n    Polygon,\n    Text,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nclass ImageExample extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n. Or equivalently, but perhaps a bit simpler to see the difference:jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Svg, {\n    Image,\n    Defs,\n    Circle,\n    ClipPath,\n    Polygon,\n    Text,\n    G,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nclass ImageExample extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n```. This question probably belongs in the VictoryCharts repo, perhaps can try using a recently forked version of it where the dependency has been adapted to be Expo compatible, such as this one: https://github.com/InteractionEcologies/victory-native.

Proptypes have been removed since v8 was released on 19 Oct 2018: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/805. Hmm, haven't seen this before. Are you able to replicate this in a new project? I wonder why/when this would have changed. I'll try on a windows machine later on.. react-native-svg doesnt have any control of this aspect, we only have the library specific build.gradle file: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/android/build.gradle\nreact-native-cli does the rest. That doesn't render anything in any browser or other svg viewer either. You need to refer to the gradient in a fill or stroke attribute using e.g. ` fill=\"url(#idOfGradient)\"` in some other element which causes some geometry to render. Check e.g. https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#lineargradientjsx\n<Svg\n    height=\"150\"\n    width=\"300\"\n\n<Defs>\n    <LinearGradient id=\"grad\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"170\" y2=\"0\">\n        <Stop offset=\"0\" stopColor=\"rgb(255,255,0)\" stopOpacity=\"0\" />\n        <Stop offset=\"1\" stopColor=\"red\" stopOpacity=\"1\" />\n    </LinearGradient>\n</Defs>\n<Ellipse cx=\"150\" cy=\"75\" rx=\"85\" ry=\"55\" fill=\"url(#grad)\" />\n\n\n``. Hmm, apparently the spec allow inheritance here: \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementHrefAttribute\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementHrefAttribute. https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#PaintServerTemplates\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/pservers.html#PaintServerTemplates. The resolution probably needs to be done on the native side, and per svg root. Such that id's only get resolved from within a single svg document rather than globally, and such that the gradients can be defined in any order, as I suspect some people/tools might author such content.. @Orbyt Can you try adding areturn null;` statement in between these two lines:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/b3d29c904508aa8141e678a03049efbee544915c/android/src/main/java/com/horcrux/svg/SvgView.java#L213-L214. I think this code was in reponse to crashes when width or height had strange values, and animated splash screens with the absolute fill styles, not sure i remember all the details, will try to search for it when I have more time available. But this might be a more reasonable solution either way, having it render for the first time, a few frames later than otherwise, should be an acceptable tradeoff to get use cases without absolute fill to work without flickering/i correct initial positions. . A pull request sounds good. I wonder if there would be need for a call to super.invalidate(); before returning, i have a hunch it might lead to the svg not getting rendered in some edge case. But, I would kind of assume that if the early predicate is true, then the view hierarchy will have at least some layout to do still and will cause another call to draw it later. This is also something that might be okay to release either way, as is, as anyone experiencing issues can use whatever version they had before, and report an issue so we can find a way to deal with any currently unknown/forgotten edge cases. (and hopefully start getting a test suite built) . Fixed in v9.2.4. @IljaDaderko Can you try removing this line: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6777211d7eddb43a38db0e28176ad149610fd825/elements/Svg.js#L129\nI think this was needed to get native animated transforms working on the root element, but I'm not completely sure right now.\n\nUpdate, also this line:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/6777211d7eddb43a38db0e28176ad149610fd825/elements/Svg.js#L127.

Published v9.2.2 with a few fixes for the new optimizations, here's an example showing off some of it, and native animated transforms on the root element:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Svg, {\n  Rect,\n  Circle,\n  Path,\n  G,\n  Defs,\n  LinearGradient,\n  Stop,\n} from 'react-native-svg';\nimport { colorNames } from 'react-native-svg/lib/extract/extractColor';\nimport { Animated } from 'react-native';\nconst AnimatedSvg = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Svg);\nconst colors = Object.keys(colorNames).map(name => colorNames[name]);\nconst { blue, black, white, red } = colorNames;\nconst numColors = colors.length;\nconst initialColor = red;\nconst initialIndex = colors.indexOf(initialColor);\nconst viewBox = [0, 0, 100, 100];\nconst path =\n  'M55.192 27.87l-5.825-1.092a17.98 17.98 0 0 0-1.392-3.37l3.37-4.928c.312-.456.248-1.142-.143-1.532l-4.155-4.156c-.39-.39-1.076-.454-1.532-.143l-4.928 3.37a18.023 18.023 0 0 0-3.473-1.42l-1.086-5.793c-.103-.543-.632-.983-1.185-.983h-5.877c-.553 0-1.082.44-1.185.983l-1.096 5.85a17.96 17.96 0 0 0-3.334 1.393l-4.866-3.33c-.456-.31-1.142-.247-1.532.144l-4.156 4.156c-.39.39-.454 1.076-.143 1.532l3.35 4.896a18.055 18.055 0 0 0-1.37 3.33L8.807 27.87c-.542.103-.982.632-.982 1.185v5.877c0 .553.44 1.082.982 1.185l5.82 1.09a18.013 18.013 0 0 0 1.4 3.4l-3.31 4.842c-.313.455-.25 1.14.142 1.53l4.155 4.157c.39.39 1.076.454 1.532.143l4.84-3.313c1.04.563 2.146 1.02 3.3 1.375l1.096 5.852c.103.542.632.982 1.185.982h5.877c.553 0 1.082-.44 1.185-.982l1.086-5.796c1.2-.354 2.354-.82 3.438-1.4l4.902 3.353c.456.313 1.142.25 1.532-.142l4.155-4.154c.39-.39.454-1.076.143-1.532l-3.335-4.874a18.016 18.016 0 0 0 1.424-3.44l5.82-1.09c.54-.104.98-.633.98-1.186v-5.877c0-.553-.44-1.082-.982-1.185zM32 42.085c-5.568 0-10.083-4.515-10.083-10.086 0-5.568 4.515-10.084 10.083-10.084 5.57 0 10.086 4.516 10.086 10.083 0 5.57-4.517 10.085-10.086 10.085z';\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    color: initialColor,\n    index: initialIndex,\n    initAnim: new Animated.Value(initialIndex),\n  };\nanimate(index) {\n    Animated.timing(this.state.initAnim, {\n      toValue: index + 1,\n      duration: 3000,\n      useNativeDriver: true,\n    }).start();\n  }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.animate(this.state.index);\n  }\nonPress = () => {\n    this.setState(({ index }) => {\n      const newIndex = (index + 1) % numColors;\n      this.animate(newIndex);\n      return {\n        color: colors[newIndex],\n        index: newIndex,\n      };\n    });\n  };\nrender() {\n    const { initAnim, color } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n``. Is the separate width and height parts needed? If so, you can probably replace the width * height == 0 in the early predicate. Yeah, i just noticed that the code that was changing those values got removed/doesn't exist anymore, and only the product, or comparing both width and height to zero separately, is needed. Doing both is redundant now that they're only set once. . @Orbyt there's another pr https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/925 to check for negative values as well, so I would remove thewidth * height == 0, and make it check forwidth < 1 || height < 1` or <= 0, instead.. What width and height values do you give your Svg element? I suspect it might be too big to fit in memory.. I would recommend striving to have the svg width and height to be at most as big as the native screen resolution on the device, and transform the content in response to pan/touch. Or, you might have use for what I've suggested here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/573#issuecomment-432892772 and the excellent videos made by @wcandillon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrsBXKr6gdg\nhttps://github.com/wcandillon/can-it-be-done-in-react-native\nThe technique boils down to using absolute positioning, to place a scrollview above the svg content that covers it completely, and placing an empty view inside the scrollview with the size set to the amount of overscroll you want available for scrolling in different directions. Finally, connecting the scroll events to transform the svg content below.\nAlternatively, you can use something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/zoomable-svg\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/374\nThis allows you to pinch and zoom to any size and get perfect vector graphics rendering, while keeping the bitmap size the same as the screen, and memory consumption relatively low.\nIf you allow your svg root size to grow, it'll keep eating more memory and make rendering slower as it needs to paint more pixels. So I would avoid having large bitmaps, unless the content is static and only needs to be rendered once and also fits in memory safely. In that case it can be the best performing way, as the scrolling merely needs to transform the bitmap around, rather than render vector graphics for each frame.. @ankardon I think I've fixed the issue. Can you try https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/abb17bc7f0985c0b5eaa85ead7351e5c74a731f8. I tried setting up some end-to-end tests here in case you're interested: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-e2e. I have jest working with detox e2e tests on travis ci here: https://travis-ci.org/msand/react-native-svg-e2e/builds/501950972\nCode: https://github.com/msand/react-native-svg-e2e\nTaking screenshots works, at least locally on my machine, for both ios and android. For iOS I have screenshots working in bitrise as well: https://app.bitrise.io/build/30da440330c913ea \nHaven't got android e2e tests working there yet (builds work fine), and haven't tried making screenshots work in travis.. It seems that for plain javascript testing in node.js we could provide mock implementations in a __mocks__ folder: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/manual-mocks.html\nhttps://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react-native#mock-native-modules-using-jestmock\nSomething in the style of:\njs\njest.mock('Text', () => {\n  const RealComponent = jest.requireActual('Text');\n  const React = require('React');\n  class Text extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      return React.createElement('Text', this.props, this.props.children);\n    }\n  }\n  Text.propTypes = RealComponent.propTypes;\n  return Text;\n});\nWe could probably provide setters in the files in the elements folder, allowing to override the native component with a mock, thus enabling to snapshot even the values sent to the native side to test the js logic of react-native-svg for changes.\nAlthough, that seems more like an implementation detail and not really relevant to users of react-native-svg. As it might even change just because of changing the react-native-svg version, when there are api changes made in sync to both js and native, or when the js code has some bugs fixed/features added. But, makes more sense for internal tests in this repo.\nI guess for external use, something like the Text mock in the example here should allow to snapshot the values which are given to the publicly exposed api of react-native-svg.. These might interest anyone working on this: \nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/7da864284997109a37bbef739289c5e6e8d0514e/jest/setup.js\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/7da864284997109a37bbef739289c5e6e8d0514e/jest/mockComponent.js. In case anyone's interested, I managed to get x86 and x86_64 android images running on travis using the latest android emulator canary, which now works in headless mode without hardware acceleration / kvm support: https://travis-ci.org/msand/test_emulators/builds/502382369. Got android working on bitrise now as well: https://app.bitrise.io/build/c31c1a40907cd137. Btw, have you looked at these?\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/198\nhttps://gist.github.com/JCMais/8302a1646ccc9759237947a66bdda8e0\nhttps://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-svg-mock\n. Thanks for this, much appreciated!. @Joktaii It seems to work fine in the latest version at least, what versions are you using?\nhttps://github.com/msand/RN059/commit/720be5fa4538da8c695a989044ba6a4d142421c0\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component, useState } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nfunction SvgTest() {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n  );\n}\nconst Home = () => {\n  const [display, setDisplay] = useState('flex');\n  return (\n    \n setDisplay(display === 'flex' ? 'none' : 'flex')}\n      >\n         Testing display attribute \n\n\n\n\n\n  );\n};\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    padding: 50,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: '#333333',\n  },\n  svg: {\n    alignItems: 'center',\n  },\n});\n. @Joktaii Can you give a full reproduction? Or at least one which shows the buggy rendering.. I was thinking more in terms of code, could you copy paste the code you used for that video? . Can you try rebuilding your native bundle? The changes to the js and native logic were done in sync. This means you must be using old native or js logic with new native or js logic to be able to get this type of error. (new js with old native obj-c code in this case) . Can you open the project in xcode, clean the build, and build again? Seems your native code didn't update. You use the version of react-native-svg that comes built into expo. And if you need a newer version, you either eject from expo or request them to upgrade the dependency. . Try removing your node_modules, clear caches, install, and run again.. This issue probably belonged in the svgr repo, as it's fixed I'll close this now.. ? . Can you provide a full replication?. You can use either one, but clipping will likely be more efficient, e.g. clipPath with clipRule set to evenodd and geometry something like this will probably be the easiest:jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Defs, ClipPath, Circle, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can use clipRule=\"nonzero\" and draw path segments in opposite directions such that they cancel out in the parts you want to exclude:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/masking.html#ClipRuleProperty\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/painting.html#FillRuleProperty\nSomething a bit like this:\njsx\n        <Svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\">\n          <Defs>\n            <ClipPath id=\"clip\" clipRule=\"nonzero\">\n              <Path d=\"\n              M50 50 h100 v100 H50z\n              m25 25 v50  h50  V75z\" />\n            </ClipPath>\n          </Defs>\n          <Circle cx={100} cy={100} r={55} clipPath=\"url(#clip)\" />\n        </Svg>. How about this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/ranting-mixed-nuts\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Rect, Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  showEvent = (evt, message) => {\n    /*\n    https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system\n      evt is a synthetic touch event with the following form:\n    nativeEvent\n      changedTouches - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event\n      identifier - The ID of the touch\n      locationX - The X position of the touch, relative to the element\n      locationY - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element\n      pageX - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element\n      pageY - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element\n      target - The node id of the element receiving the touch event\n      timestamp - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation\n      touches - Array of all current touches on the screen\n*/\nconst { nativeEvent } = evt;\nconst {\n  changedTouches, // this array will contain nativeEvent when onPress triggers, making the structure circular\n  identifier,\n  locationX,\n  locationY,\n  pageX,\n  pageY,\n  target,\n  timestamp,\n  touches,\n} = nativeEvent;\nconsole.log({\n  message,\n  changedTouches,\n  identifier,\n  locationX,\n  locationY,\n  pageX,\n  pageY,\n  target,\n  timestamp,\n  touches,\n});\n// cannot do this, causes exception: Converting circular structure to JSON\n// console.log(JSON.stringify(evt))\n\n};\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n {\n              this.showEvent(event, 'rect');\n            }}\n          />\n           {\n              this.showEvent(event, 'circle');\n            }}\n          />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\n.

Upgrading Expo to v32 seems to make it work correctly in Android. iOS seems to have the bug you describe. https://snack.expo.io/@msand/playful-tea\nYou can request Expo to upgrade their version of react-native-svg to the latest one for v33..

The rotations happen about the origin, so if you want to rotate in some other coordinate system, you first need to transform that one to the origin, apply the rotation, and transform it back. That is what the spec says that the optional arguments to the rotate transform definition must do:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute\n\nrotate(<rotate-angle> [<cx> <cy>]), which specifies a rotation by <rotate-angle> degrees about a given point.\nIf optional parameters <cx> and <cy> are not supplied, the rotate is about the origin of the current user coordinate system. The operation corresponds to the matrix [cos(a) sin(a) -sin(a) cos(a) 0 0].\nIf optional parameters <cx> and <cy> are supplied, the rotate is about the point (cx, cy). The operation represents the equivalent of the following specification: translate(<cx>, <cy>) rotate(<rotate-angle>) translate(-<cx>, -<cy>).\n\nMore info at:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#svg-transform-functions\nIf you have many of these, I would recommend moving the origin to the center, by using \nviewBox=\"-originX -originY width height\" as I've done in the native animation example (with a width and height of 100 units to make them similar to percentages, shifted half of that i.e., 50 units in both directions). And, rendering the content such that the rotation doesn't need any additional transforms, but can be animated in-place instead.. @gh357550318 updated the example a bit. Can you try with e.g. the latest commit from the vector-effect branch e.g.:\nyarn add react-native-svg@react-native-community/react-native-svg#dc94707. Btw, if you're only rendering png images and text, why not use the react-native Image and Text components? And react-native style transforms on that? It's likely to be more efficient anyway.. Should be enough to have the image render before the text in document order. I'll take a look at your example when I have a bit less urgent schedule.. This workaround seems to work in expo: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/rebellious-strawberries\njsx\n        <Svg height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\">\n          <Text\n            y={20}\n            fontSize={20}\n            fill={'#000'}\n            onPress={() => {\n              console.warn('text pressed');\n            }}>\n            TEST\n          </Text>\n        </Svg>\nAnd I think I've fixed the underlying issue in the fix-text-onpress branch, can you try with this commit please? https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/ccb80264622b436bcaebccf05a12d139233e919f. You mean something like this? https://snack.expo.io/@msand/spunky-coffee\nYou're probably just missing a y attribute on the Text element to place it where you wish, and/or you need different fill color for the Rect and the Text:\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Rect, Text } = Svg;\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n            0\n          \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```. Thanks! Sure, same as on the web ideally. So, additionally you can use currentColor in the fill and stroke attribute of the elements and set it using the color attribute of the root Svg element, so you can have a global stroke and fill, plus a third tint/currentColor for context dependent / themable parts. Additionally you can create react components with normal prop overrides, render props etc.\nReact web: https://codesandbox.io/s/10qm4kozw7\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Linking } from \"react-native\";\nimport { Svg, Path } from \"swgs\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\nconst Icon = props => (\n  <Svg\n    title=\"pencil\"\n    width=\"20\"\n    height=\"20\"\n    fill=\"blue\"\n    stroke=\"red\"\n    color=\"green\"\n    style={{\n      alignSelf: \"center\"\n    }}\n    viewBox=\"-16 -16 544 544\"\n    {...props}\n\n<Path\n  d=\"M318.37,85.45L422.53,190.11,158.89,455,54.79,350.38ZM501.56,60.2L455.11,13.53a45.93,45.93,0,0,0-65.11,0L345.51,58.24,449.66,162.9l51.9-52.15A35.8,35.8,0,0,0,501.56,60.2ZM0.29,497.49a11.88,11.88,0,0,0,14.34,14.17l116.06-28.28L26.59,378.72Z\"\n  strokeWidth=\"32\"\n/>\n<Path d=\"M0,0L512,512\" stroke=\"currentColor\" strokeWidth=\"32\" />\n\n\n);\n\nconst link =\n  \"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/943\";\nfunction App() {\n  const onPress = () => Linking.openURL(link);\n  return (\n    \n\n\n\n\n  );\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n    backgroundColor: \"#ecf0f1\",\n    padding: 8\n  }\n});\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nReactDOM.render(, rootElement);\n```\nSnack: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/forlorn-raisins\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, StyleSheet, Linking } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants } from 'expo';\nimport { Svg, Path } from 'swgs';\nconst Icon = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n            Linking.openURL(\n              'https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/943'\n            )\n          }\n        />\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```\nVanilla web: https://codesandbox.io/s/0y810wkvpn\n```html\n<div\n  style=\"display: flex; height: 100vh; flex-direction: column; background-color: #ecf0f1; padding: 8\"\n\n<a\n    href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/943\"\n<svg\n  role=\"img\"\n  aria-label=\"[title]\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"100%\"\n  fill=\"blue\"\n  stroke=\"red\"\n  color=\"green\"\n  style=\"align-self: center\"\n  viewBox=\"-16 -16 544 544\"\n\n  <title>pencil</title>\n  <path\n    d=\"M318.37,85.45L422.53,190.11,158.89,455,54.79,350.38ZM501.56,60.2L455.11,13.53a45.93,45.93,0,0,0-65.11,0L345.51,58.24,449.66,162.9l51.9-52.15A35.8,35.8,0,0,0,501.56,60.2ZM0.29,497.49a11.88,11.88,0,0,0,14.34,14.17l116.06-28.28L26.59,378.72Z\"\n    stroke-width=\"32\"\n  />\n  <path d=\"M0,0L512,512\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"32\" />\n</svg>\n\n\n\n\n```\nPRs with Improvements to the documentation would be greatly appreciated!. \n. Sounds good. Yeah, it supports the stroke, fill, color and additionally onLayout, opacity, transform, inherited font and style. The style property should allow setting default text properties as well, (but I haven't tested it properly):\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/elements/Svg.js#L58-L90\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/elements/Svg.js#L112-L144\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/elements/G.js#L20-L26\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/lib/extract/extractProps.js#L9-L31\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/lib/extract/extractText.js#L47-L59\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/lib/extract/extractText.js#L107-L109. Oh, and the Touchable / PanResponder props: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/be6a517029de9a26a796139b641349571944bd7c/lib/extract/extractResponder.js#L1-L16\n(Due to extractResponder in the Svg root). The title attribute is only supported by svgs and swgs on the web for now. On native it doesn't do anything at the moment.. Essentially, anything you can do with a G element + anything you can do with a View element + the color, width, height, viewBox, and, preserveAspectRatio attributes.. I just noticed we're not really spec conformant. The svg spec requires support for a few more pointer-events values: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html#PointerEventsProperty\nName: | pointer-events\n-- | --\nValue: | bounding-box \\| visiblePainted \\| visibleFill \\| visibleStroke \\| visible \\| painted \\| fill \\| stroke \\| all \\| none\nInitial: | visiblePainted\nApplies to: | container elements,\u00a0graphics elements\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018use\u2019\nInherited: | yes\nPercentages: | N/A\nMedia: | visual\nComputed value: | as specified\nAnimatable: | yes\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/interact.html#PointerEventsProp\nBut, for now we can just keep it in sync with react-native.. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view#pointerevents\n\npointerEvents\nControls whether the View can be the target of touch events.\n'auto': The View can be the target of touch events.\n'none': The View is never the target of touch events.\n'box-none': The View is never the target of touch events but it's subviews can be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:\ncss\n.box-none {\n     pointer-events: none;\n}\n.box-none * {\n     pointer-events: all;\n}\n'box-only': The view can be the target of touch events but it's subviews cannot be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:\ncss\n.box-only {\n     pointer-events: all;\n}\n.box-only * {\n     pointer-events: none;\n}\n\nHtml only supports auto, inherit and none:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events#Values\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/pointer-events\nhttps://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/pointer-events/. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events#Values\nauto\nThe element behaves as it would if the pointer-events property were not specified. In SVG content, this value and the value visiblePainted have the same effect.\nnone\nThe element is never the target of pointer events; however, pointer events may target its descendant elements if those descendants have pointer-events set to some other value. In these circumstances, pointer events will trigger event listeners on this parent element as appropriate on their way to/from the descendant during the event capture/bubble phases.\nhttps://webkit.org/specs/PointerEventsProperty.html\nThe pointer-events property was originally defined for SVG content and, as such, accepts property values specific to vector graphics (eg. relating to graphical fill and stroke). The following definition only applies to the property when used with HTML content. Note that the property has a new initial value, \"auto\", which behaves as \"visiblePainted\" in SVG content and \"visible\" in non-SVG content.\nauto\nIn SVG content, behave as visiblePainted. Otherwise, behave as visible.\nvisible\nThe given element receives pointer events.\nnone\nThe given element does not receive pointer events.. Sorry for not getting back to this earlier, had other priorities I needed to deal with. Thanks for the PR!. I would recommend limiting the size of the Svg root element to the size of the native screen resolution, and use native animation of transforms using a ScrollView instead, like this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/efficient-transform-of-large-svg-surfaces\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Animated, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, G, Rect } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst AnimatedG = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(G);\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\n// Choose the amount of available viewport you want for scrolling here\nconst scrollHeight = height * 3;\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  scroll: {\n    height: scrollHeight,\n    width,\n  },\n  absolute: {\n    position: 'absolute',\n  },\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n  },\n});\nclass ScrollSvg extends React.PureComponent {\n  render() {\n    const { y } = this.props;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    y: new Animated.Value(0),\n  };\n  render() {\n    const { y } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nIt seems to crash on Expo when using Android. But works fine with the latest react-native and react-native-svg versions at least.\nDo you think this can cover your needs?. Great, thanks for this! Could you change the wording from cascade to inheritance?\nhttps://webplatform.github.io/docs/tutorials/inheritance_and_cascade/\nInheritance is associated with how the elements in the HTML markup inherit properties from their parent (containing) elements and pass them on to their children.\nThe cascade relates to CSS declarations being applied to a document, and how conflicting rules do or do not override each other.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#intro\nOne of the fundamental design principles of CSS is cascading, which allows several style sheets to influence the presentation of a document. When different declarations try to set a value for the same element/property combination, the conflicts must somehow be resolved.\nThe opposite problem arises when no declarations try to set a the value for an element/property combination. In this case, a value is be found by way of inheritance or by looking at the property\u2019s initial value.. Thanks for this!. Very interesting. I wonder if it's being render twice at the same time, once by the normal view hierarchy, and once by the toDataUrl call. Could you try doing the call in the ref callback, like this:\njsx\n        <Svg\n          ref={ele => {\n            ele.toDataURL(\n              base64Image => {\n                console.log(base64Image);\n              }\n            );\n          }}\nAlternatively, try doing the rendering a bit later using a setTimeout. I'll try running the code later. If you find any way to trigger it reliably, please let me know.. I guess making a Lock on the root svg element and acquiring it in the root render and the toDataUrl method should ensure that only one render pass is active at any one time.\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html. Or, just making SvgView.drawChildren synchronized. @Ayiga can you try with https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/fdd8f93dac675263c1aed741f0d137345cdc1498. @Ayiga I suspect there will still be concurrency issues in your patch, the drawChildren method will need to be synchronized at the very least, but the toDataUrl method which has a custom size on the canvas will also need to be synchronized, and, it will need to call \njava\n        clearChildCache();\nAs the first and the last thing it does. Otherwise, any paths which have % units dependant on the width, height or diagonal, will render incorrectly.. Also, if the GlyphContext pop is called a different number of times than push, then it's a bug and it should certainly throw an exception. . Can you try with the develop branch, I've made some fixes to toDataUrl and am hoping it would resolve your issues as well.. Can you try with v9.2.5 ?\nThis seems to work fine at least:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, Image, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nclass SvgComponent extends Component {\n  state = {};\n  onRef = ref => {\n    if (ref) {\n      this.ref = ref;\n    }\n  };\n  onLayout = () => {\n    this.ref.toDataURL(base64 => {\n      this.setState({ base64 });\n    });\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n          {this.state.base64 && (\n            data:image/png;base64,${this.state.base64} }}\n              style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }}\n            />\n          )}\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: 50,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```. Perhaps something like this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/restless-fudge\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View, ViewPropTypes } from 'react-native';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\nimport Svg, { Path, G } from 'react-native-svg';\n// https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/949\nconst maxPercentage = 100;\nconst generateCoordinates = percent => {\n  const a = (percent * 2 * Math.PI) / maxPercentage;\n  const x = Math.cos(a);\n  const y = Math.sin(a);\n  return [x, y];\n};\nconst PieChart = ({ style, data, size }) => {\n  const radius = size / 2;\n  const viewBox = -${radius} -${radius} ${size} ${size};\n  let cumulativePercent = 0;\nreturn (\n    \n\n        {data.map(slice => {\n          const largeArcFlag = slice.percent > maxPercentage / 2 ? 1 : 0;\n          const xAxisRotation = 0;\n          const sweepFlag = 1;\n          const scaleValue = slice.percentScale / maxPercentage;\n          const [startX, startY] = generateCoordinates(cumulativePercent);\n          const [endX, endY] = generateCoordinates(\n            (cumulativePercent += slice.percent)\n          );\n      // Building the SVG\n      const m = `M ${startX * radius} ${startY * radius}`;\n      const a = `A ${radius} ${radius} ${xAxisRotation} ${largeArcFlag} ${sweepFlag} ${endX *\n        radius} ${endY * radius}`;\n      const l = 'L 0 0';\n\n      // Calculate offset here\n      const offset = radius * 0.005;\n      const offsetX = offset * (startX + endX + 1);\n      const offsetY = offset * (startY + endY + 1);\n\n      return (\n        <G key={slice.id} transform={`translate(${offsetX}, ${offsetY})scale(${scaleValue})`}>\n          <Path d={`${m} ${a} ${l}`} fill={slice.color} />\n        </G>\n      );\n    })}\n  </Svg>\n</View>\n\n);\n};\nPieChart.propTypes = {\n  style: ViewPropTypes.style,\n  data: PropTypes.arrayOf(\n    PropTypes.shape({\n      location: PropTypes.string,\n      leads: PropTypes.number,\n      percent: PropTypes.number,\n      percentScale: PropTypes.number,\n      color: PropTypes.string,\n    })\n  ).isRequired,\n  size: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n};\nPieChart.defaultProps = {\n  style: {},\n};\nexport default () => {\n  return (\n    \n  );\n};\n```. Does this handle giving arrays of styles which have been processed by Stylesheet from react-native-web?\nIt optimizes them to be represented as integers, and I think createElement imported from react won't handle them correctly: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/593#issuecomment-394803437\nWill probably need createElement from react-native-web and perhaps Stylesheet.compose:\nhttps://github.com/necolas/icon-builder-example/blob/master/scripts/createReactPackage.js#L31-L36\n@necolas Please advice. @necolas Is it sufficient to use createElement from react-native-web, to handle the integer representation? Or does the style prop need processing before that? It seems the Stylesheet.compose you have in your article might only be needed if you have a fallback stylesheet. But, if you don't have/need that, you can just call createElement with the props straight away, no?. Great, thanks for the information! I guess it might be good to wrap the import/require of react-native-web in a try catch block, and import from react in case react-native-web isn't available. Then it can be used in plain react projects as well.. Well, if it's used in a library, then it should define a peer dependency. And when used inside a single project, the authors should probably be aware of if they're using plain react or if they've configured react-native-web to work and if they're using Stylesheet or not. In either case, it should work as expected no? Or am I forgetting something critical?. Well, e.g. all the downloads of svgs builds essentially on the want to have support for that use case, but with support for the additional attributes / behavior which is specific to react-native-svg rather than the svg spec. I guess people can just keep using svgs for that/those use cases. But seems like it would make sense to support it in this library straight away as well, rather than forcing people who want to develop svg components for both native and web, to use react-native-web in the plain web projects. Or are there any drawbacks to supporting that? I don't think I've seen any argument against it yet, or what lies behind your reasoning? I'm not sure I completely understand it or what would be bizarre about the api.. Shouldn't require calls obey the CommonJS spec ?\n\nContract\nModule Context\n1. In a module, there is a free variable \"require\", that is a function.\n    1. The \"require\" function accepts a module identifier.\n    2. \"require\" returns the exported API of the foreign module.\n    3. If there is a dependency cycle, the foreign module may not have finished executing at the time it is required by one of its transitive dependencies; in this case, the object returned by \"require\" must contain at least the exports that the foreign module has prepared before the call to require that led to the current module's execution.\n    4. If the requested module cannot be returned, \"require\" must throw an error.\n\nIn a module, there is a free variable called \"exports\", that is an object that the module may add its API to as it executes.\nmodules must use the \"exports\" object as the only means of exporting.\n\n\nI haven't seen it fail in practise when used in dependencies. Can you give an example?\nIf this is an actual issue. Then I would suggest keeping this kind of interop layer outside the react-native-svg repo, as there are multiple options, and either choice made would upset the users preferring the other option. If its kept in external modules, such as svgs if you want plain react, and swgs if you want react-native-web, then you get choose which import you prefer.\nThen you get to choose if you want your svg components to work with all react projects, or only with projects which provide react-native compatible Stylesheet (for both native and web project) and the react-native-web optimized createElement (for web projects, not used in native apis at the moment).\nAlternatively, a third module could be made (maybe react-svg-compat or something like this), which requires react-native-web and if that fails, requires react. This would allow using the optimization where possible, and still work in other environments, and find out if it causes problems in practise, (given enough exposure).\nBut, if the support for using react-native-web is unanimous, then we can probably merge it here. But, then the api on the web should probably match the api on native. Thus it should have the logic developed in the svgs package, rather than a stripped down implementation like this. Otherwise the api would actually have quite significant differences.\nAnd, if a stripped down web implementation is wanted (e.g. because you're not using the non-standard react-native-svg specific parts anyway), then this can be made into another external package which merely does what this PR includes, and uses the normal react-native-svg implementation otherwise.\nWhat do you think?. @3rd-Eden Any thoughts on this?. Afaik, tree shaking doesn't work at all with require, nor does it work well with modules which have side-effects in their initialization. In this case, both svgs and react-native-svg have very little js code to tree-shake to begin with.\nAnd, I think you might be thinking of project code which gets transpiled. If you have a dependency which you import (or require for that matter), if it uses require internally, it'll use CommonJS compatible behavior and won't be able to use import/export syntax, but will need to use the module.exports syntax instead. So, if you have a dependency in node_modules which uses require (or has been transpiled to use it), then it'll resolve the modules correctly, and won't include any additional code. At least what I've seen in the wild. But if anyone has an example of actual code demonstrating this issue then I'm very interested to see it and know to avoid it.. Regarding the Stylesheet api, currently .create in the react-native implementation is the identity function (in production, dev mode has validation as well): https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/2f32fea79a50bdae303126f6d5288ea447f5331b/Libraries/StyleSheet/StyleSheet.js#L346-L362\nSo, supporting that in the web version is relatively trivial.\nThe main thing to support is the additional attributes that react-native-svg has. And, when using a react-native-web project, to resolve the integer representations to the actual classnames/styles. This can already be done by using the swgs package, it is essentially exactly the same as the svgs package, except it imports react-native-web instead of react for the web version.\nIf anyone needs to override the web implementation, then they could import e.g. svgs to use plain react. Or, some other implementation like the one in this pr, to leave out the extra attributes (if it would be published as a separate package).\nSo, I would just like know what @3rd-Eden thinks of this, and that he would be fine with merging our efforts into this repository (with react-native-web imported, so essentially deprecating swgs and moving it in here), and keeping svgs going as is for the plain react-web projects.\n@EvanBacon @ide @necolas Would this satisfy all your wishes?. I'm very much in support of merging our efforts \ud83d\udc4d I'm thinking that two working example projects: one plain react and another using react-native-web, importing from a single library, without fetching/bundling unused code, would be the ideal situation. I wonder if we could use different file extensions to handle it nicely, or provide differing implementations under different subfolders and allow to choose which one is wanted using the webpack/babel/metro config. I haven't seen any library with differing implementations for plain react web and react-native-web, but perhaps .rweb.js and .rnweb.js, and a default .web.js could work?\nOr, actually, perhaps the plain react web implementation could be in react-native-svg/web/index.js Such that if you're interested in the use case of not using Stylesheet and want compatibility with both plain react web projects and react-native-svg, then you can import from there, knowing that you won't force your library users to adopt react-native-web and Stylesheet in their web projects. In case they meet too much resistance to it in their organization/project, or just want a wider potential user base for svg based react components. \nAnd then, we would provide the react-native-web compatible implementation as index.web.js in the root as the default. As you're relatively likely to be using react-native components and Stylesheet for something in your project anyway, in case you're importing react-native-svg.. @ide The discussion with @3rd-Eden in this case is about https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgs which is the library that implements the react-native-svg compatible layer for plain react web projects (and doesn't use/require react-native-web). It's useful for anyone wanting to make platform independent svg components without necessarily depending on react-native-web. \nI've forked svgs as swgs, and only changed it to import react-native-web instead of react, to get the api compatibility you're asking for (or am I missing something?). So in this case I guess it just means including the https://github.com/msand/swgs/blob/master/index.js file as index.web.js in this project instead?\nAnd if we want to merge the svgs use case into this repo as well, then we can either provide it from a subfolder, such that no conflicts should arise for the react-native-web use case and module fetching/bundling, or alternatively a monorepo could be used. But the monorepo structure would essentially entail maintaining separate package-names, and in that case, separate repos might be just as good a tradeoff.. At least as a library author, if I can choose to release svg based components which work with either \na) only react-native and react-native-web projects\nb) normal react projects as well\nThen the choice seems obvious, there are much more plain react projects than react-native and react-native-web combined.. And I think the benefits go both ways, more react-native-svg based components work in more web projects, and more svg components for plain web can be made native compatible, essentially just by capitalizing the first letter of the tags in jsx, and importing the svgs library.. I just realized, that the same techniques used to alias react-native to react-native-web, can be used to alias react-native-web to react. So the power to override the default is still in the hands of the end user, even if we only provide a single .web.js implementation, as we're not using anything else than createElement from react-native-web anyway.. Ideally, I would like to get rid of the api differences to the web/spec. But they've been there from before I started maintaining the code, and are relatively grandfathered in. And I guess it exists mainly because there was no proper transform parser before that (v5 and earlier).\nIf we were to remove the differences, e.g. in a major v10 release, then this PR (plus adding the Pattern and Mask elements which exist in the latest version) should cover everything. What do you think of this? It's a relatively large breaking change, and I suspect many react-native-svg based modules would break if it was done, not to mention project code needing non-value producing churn.\nThe change could cause:\n- \ud83d\udc4da minor performance and bundle size improvement from removing the extra logic, but not enough to validate the churn, it's relatively simple js logic and only done on render so sCU can handle optimizations if needed. \n- \ud83d\udc4dimproved alignment with the spec/web (possibly bigger impact, but still not enough to motivate the change). \n- \ud83d\udc4dcleaner implementation, currently the old api pollutes the rest of the code-base with non-spec conformant and relatively accidental api design choices/decisions made\n- \ud83d\udc4esome users might find the current api more user-friendly for their needs (speculative, but when I've accidentally broken it at times, the issues opened can seem relatively emotional at least).\nIt could possibly be done in a two stage process, with deprecation warnings given first, and once the community has had time to make their libraries spec conformant, the logic could be cleaned up.\nAlternatively, we just merge swgs into this library, and keep the api as is. Or any other suggestions/preferences?. Btw, the cleaned up api has been something I've planned for when Fabric has been released. At which point I'd like to make the js code for the react-native implementation look much more like the code for the web implementation in this pr. That would also prepare the logic to be used as a Unimodule in e.g. Flutter, or in plain Android / iOS projects. The next step after that would be a rewrite to a cross-platform rust implementation, similar to the strategy used in azul but with interactions and animations properly handled.\nSo, perhaps the best course of action here is to just merge swgs for now. Or does anyone have any objections or other thoughts relating to any of this?. I've refactored the implementation from swgs a bit and added it under the web branch here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/compare/web\nI think this should cover the main use cases, and allow the end users to override if needed.. I noticed there were bugs in swgs for handling react-native-web StyleSheets, and bugs in both svgs and swgs for handling arrays of styles. Fixed both, and ensured it works in both react-native-web and plain react web projects.. proof of concept examples:\nreact-native-web: https://codesandbox.io/s/q7nqlr1xq6\nplain react-web: https://codesandbox.io/s/mjj41y558j. I think I'm satisfied with the implementation in the web branch for now, if anyone finds differences between the web and the native version, we'll fix it in the native code if it's a spec conformance bug, and in the web code if it's missing compatibility for some added feature from react-native-svg. I'd be ready to merge and release that at this point. I'll probably cut a release tomorrow, unless anyone comes up with any blockers.. v9.3.3 is available with a .web.js implementation now, perhaps we can close this? Or is there anything left to this?. If you're fine with using Animated without useNativeDriver, then it should work as is. If you want the native driven animation, you'll need to use a PR I made but didn't get merged yet/hasn't been rebased to the latest version of react-native: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/18187\nIf you'd be available to work on that PR it would be greatly appreciated!. I just tried rebasing to the latest 0.59 release candidate and it seems to work fine in both iOS and Android.\nYou can try it using: yarn add react-native@msand/react-native#f462f97\nCommit:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f462f97598b38d2071e569a37fc2c24acb7a744f\nBranch:\nhttps://github.com/msand/react-native/tree/native-animated-string-interpolation-RN059\nDiff to react-native 0.59-stable (if you want to rebase/apply it yourself to e.g. 0.58, or adapt it to the master branch):\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/0.59-stable...msand:native-animated-string-interpolation-RN059\nAnd e.g. this:\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions, Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport { Svg, Rect, Path } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\nconst AnimatedRect = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Rect);\nconst AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path);\nfunction getInitialState() {\n  const anim = new Animated.Value(0);\n  const fillOpacity = anim.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [0, 1],\n  });\n  const offset = fillOpacity.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [0, 10],\n  });\n  const strokeOpacity = offset.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 10],\n    outputRange: [0, 1],\n    extrapolateRight: 'clamp',\n  });\n  const path = anim.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: ['M20,20L20,80L80,80L80,20Z', 'M40,40L33,60L60,60L65,40Z'],\n  });\n  const fill = strokeOpacity.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: ['rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)', 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.99)'],\n  });\n  const oneToFivePx = offset.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 10],\n    outputRange: ['1px', '5px'],\n  });\n  return { anim, fillOpacity, offset, strokeOpacity, path, fill, oneToFivePx };\n}\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  state = getInitialState();\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    const { anim } = this.state;\n    Animated.timing(anim, {\n      toValue: 1,\n      duration: 10000,\n      useNativeDriver: true,\n    }).start();\n  }\nrender() {\n    const { fillOpacity, offset, strokeOpacity, path, fill, oneToFivePx } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n  },\n});\n. How aboutjsx\n        \n\n\n\n``\nOr just using two Rect elements?. What version is this? At least the latest code doesn't have a single occurrence of.stop` anywhere in the code. So can't be very recent. Could you try upgrading?. Please try upgrading to the latest version. @scottmas Great, thanks for this! In practise there are a few more inputs which get mapped to enum values on the native side:\njsx\nconst vectorEffects = {\n  none: 0,\n  default: 0,\n  nonScalingStroke: 1,\n  'non-scaling-stroke': 1,\n  inherit: 2,\n  uri: 3\n};\nBut only (the default values, and) 'nonScalingStroke' / 'non-scaling-stroke' have an implementation, and I guess 'non-scaling-stroke' is the value used even in normal React web svg content, so this is probably good as is. Or what do you think, should we add more values to the types? \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/vectoreffects.html#vector-effect-prop\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/painting.html#NonScalingStroke\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/single-page.html#coords-VectorEffects. This is called the winding rule in vector based graphics, specifically the non-zero fill-rule in svg. There's also the even-odd value you might want to explore:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule\nhttps://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/single-page.html#painting-WindingRule\nhttps://oreillymedia.github.io/Using_SVG/extras/ch06-fill-rule.html\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-svg-fill-rule-property/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule. Thanks for this!. Can you make a reproduction?. @j-wang Interesting. Could you possibly have non svg elements inside the svg element?. @j-wang Can you try the fix from here: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/ec9637bcc5b43633eaa3413c99001ac4da946104\n```patch\n--- ios/Elements/RNSVGGroup.m   (revision cdf862ba73b0e17e574bfc25970f6363915128d2)\n+++ ios/Elements/RNSVGGroup.m   (revision ec9637bcc5b43633eaa3413c99001ac4da946104)\n@@ -174,7 +174,7 @@\n     }\n if (!event) {\n\n\nNSPredicate *const anyActive = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"active == TRUE\"];\nNSPredicate const anyActive = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"self isKindOfClass: %@ AND active == TRUE\", [RNSVGNode class]];\n         NSArray const filtered = [self.subviews filteredArrayUsingPredicate:anyActive];\n         if ([filtered count] != 0) {\n             return [filtered.lastObject hitTest:transformed withEvent:event];\n\n```\n. Great! Well, then it certainly seems like you have non svg elements inside some svg element, otherwise this shouldn't be possible. Perhaps I should add some warnings in dev mode, giving some indication of what and where it is.. I think responsible is a reference to GestureResponser / PanResponder, perhaps isActiveGestureResponder would be more descriptive. What do you think?. @liron-navon Can you try with the latest version v9.3.1? It should be fixed there.. I haven't looked at webp support, have you tried any of these? https://github.com/TGPSKI/react-native-webp-support/network. Can you provide a reproduction?. Oh, I have to add something to check that the .ts works to the CI, as I'm not using it myself at this point, mostly just merging pull requests for type improvements. Thanks for this!. Published v9.3.3 with the fix. Can you make a reproduction? v5 is relatively old (from before I started maintaining). Please try clearing your cache more properly.. Not much to go on here. Can you make a replication?. If you want actual dynamic import, check random access modules: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires\nIf you just want to render based on a key, either store them in a object / map, or use import * as MySvgCollection from \"./svg\"\nAnd export each component as a named export in a index.js file in the svg folder. Then in render, get your component and return it,\nconst SvgComponent = MySvgCollection[this.props.svgName];\nreturn <SvgComponent />. Check here: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/playful-candies. How about something like this: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/text-on-a-circle-path\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Circle, Text, TextPath, TSpan, G, Path } = Svg;\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Text along a curved path... Text along a curved path... Text along a\n          curved path...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n          Text along a curved path... Text along a curved path... Text along a\n          curved path...\n        \n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n. Try using a rotate transform:jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Constants, Svg } from 'expo';\nconst { Circle, Text, TextPath, TSpan, G, Path } = Svg;\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Text along a curved path...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n          Text along a curved path...\n        \n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n. You should use the image component from react-native-svg rather than react-native:\nN.B. This code requires v9.2.4 I published some minutes ago, giving support to use images with urls as plain strings.jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport {  Circle, Text, TextPath, TSpan, G, Path, Svg, Image } from 'react-native-svg';\nconst SvgComponent = props => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Text along a curved path...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n          Text along a curved path...\n        \n\n\n\n);\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    paddingTop: 50,\n    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```. \n. I would recommend reading the svg spec, it's relatively well written. And then just google for specific tutorials/working examples if you get stuck.. I think I've fixed this now, can you try with v9.2.4 ?. Can you make a reproduction with v9.2.4 ?. Repro?. It is defined here: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#FontSizeProperty\nAnd the normative document is https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/fonts.html#propdef-font-size\nand has this to say about it:\nInitial value: medium\nAn  keyword refers to an entry in a table of font sizes computed and kept by the user agent. Possible values are:\n[ xx-small | x-small | small | medium | large | x-large | xx-large ]\nOn a computer screen a scaling factor of 1.2 is suggested between adjacent indexes; if the 'medium' font is 12pt, the 'large' font could be 14.4pt. Different media may need different scaling factors. Also, the user agent should take the quality and availability of fonts into account when computing the table. The table may be different from one font family to another.\nSo, it should be read from the font data tables/metrics actually.. This part, props2transform, transformToMatrix & universal2axis should probably be removed. They're not part of the svg spec and a source of confusion and bugs, as the order of transforms being applied isn't documented nor specified anywhere except the source code of the implementation, and is quite arbitrary. What do you think @magicismight is such a big breaking change possible? To align it with the evergreen browsers?. @brentvatne What do you think?. Seems the unions could be done once here, instead of looping twice.. The canvas/context CTM should be possible to use instead of computing the reverse transform many times.. Seems the unions could be done once here, instead of looping twice. (Same as android). The CGContext already has the CTM no need to recompute over and over.. Hmm, seems getMatrix has been deprecated, not sure if it should be used at all: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#getMatrix()\nPerhaps another parameter should be added, with the current transformation matrix, such that its O(n) in the number of nodes rather than O(m^2) in the number of ancestors of the deepest descendent.. I think it should be fine to use getMatrix, as we're creating the canvas, and it's never passed outside library code.. Hmm, I don't see you inverting the transforms in the current code, can it be that?. Or, if the initial CTM is not the identity matrix, then you might want invert(initial) * CTM, as if CTM = initial * viewbox * elementTMs then inverting the initial one and multiplying from the same direction should get it (close to, still floats involved) identity.. Well, matrix multiplication is associative, should it shouldn't matter in what order you do the multiplication (reverse, in order, or, some order which minimises the number of scalar multiplications needed, although with same size matrices that doesn't even vary). So (AxB)xC=Ax(BxC) but it's not commutative, so in general AxB != BxA. Seems you have an extra invert there, how about\nconst CGAffineTransform ctm = CGContextGetCTM(context);\n    const CGAffineTransform invertIntial = CGAffineTransformInvert(self.svgView.initialTransform);\n    self.clientRect = CGRectApplyAffineTransform(pathBouding, CGAffineTransformConcat(invertIntial, ctm));. Or can the initial transform be due to the viewbox & align?. Oh great, thanks for your work as well! Seems great to have onLayout available.. ",

    "steveliles": "I don't have problems rendering components inside the Svg hierarchy provide they don't return null or false (see  #84). \nEven state/props changes resolve correctly and trigger re-renders just fine (I am able to animate deeply nested components using state changes) so as far as I can tell diffing and reconciliation are working correctly.\n. Is it possible to support touchable props on Group elements also? It is probably possible to work around by propagating touch handlers down to nested shape elements, but this is pretty painful!\n. Cool, onPress event's on Group's work (testing with git master), but a G with no onPress event prevents touches from propagating to nested shapes (including other G elements), e.g. \nThis echoes \"i'm touched\" to the console when you tap the circle:\n<G onPress={()=>{console.log(\"i'm touched\")}}>\n  <Circle cx={50} cy={50} r={100} fill='#f00'/>\n</G>\nThis should output on the console but does not:\n<G>\n  <Circle cx={50} cy={50} r={100} fill='#f00' onPress={()=>{console.log(\"i'm touched\")}}/>\n</G>\n. OK - thanks for the quick response.\nIn the mean-time I've narrowed my current use-cases down to finding the bounding box of a <path> made up only of absolute coordinates or a <rect> where neither is subject to any transformation, so I can calculate the bounding box easily enough from the props.\n. Narrowed the crash down to a Defs element that looks like this:\n<Defs>\n    <ClipPath id=\"page\">\n      <Rect x={0} y={0} width={dimensions.width} height={dimensions.height}/>\n    </ClipPath>\n  </Defs>\nRemoving this Defs element triggers a crash on another one nested deeper in the hierarchy that looks like this:\nconst clipBounds = (bounds.type === 'path') ?\n    <Path d={bounds.path} /> : <Rect x={bounds.x} y={bounds.y} width={bounds.width} height={bounds.height}/>\n  ...\n  <Defs>\n    <ClipPath id={clipPathId}>\n      {clipBounds}\n    </ClipPath>\n  </Defs>\nRemoving both Defs prevents the crash and my SVG renders, albeit incorrectly due to the lack of clipping.\nThis code worked fine with v3.1.1.\n. I looked at the code a couple days ago for hitTest and figured the problem was that it didn't apply the viewbox matrix ... I was going to have a go at fixing at least for Android which I'm more familiar with, but it seems this was added in yesterday's commit to add touch events to G elements, so I tried with git master - the problem still exists, but it is slightly different.\nPreviously the touch events were being handled by the element that would have been under your finger if the viewBox were not applied. \nWith master nothing seems to receive the event if there is a viewBox - neither the shape that you touch nor the shape that would have been under your finger without the viewBox being applied.\nThe problem persists even if the viewBox is set to show the exact same portion of the image as with no viewBox (e.g. an SVG with width={100} height={100} and viewBox='0 0 100 100').\n. I spent a few hours debugging this one and I think its actually down to a problem with nested groups - namely that an enclosing G with no onPress steals the event (becomes the event target), though it should not.\nThis can be seen clearly with a simple example that doesn't involve a ViewBox - the following code correctly echoes \"i'm touched\" to the console when you tap the circle:\n<Svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n  <G>\n    <Circle cx={50} cy={50} r={50} fill='#f00' \n      onPress={()=>{console.log(\"i'm touched\")}}/>\n  </G>\n</Svg>\nThe following echoes nothing (but should!):\n<Svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n  <G>\n    <G>\n      <Circle cx={50} cy={50} r={50} fill='#f00' \n        onPress={()=>{console.log(\"i'm touched\")}}/>\n    </G>\n  </G>\n</Svg>\nAnd similarly, adding a viewBox attribute to the SVG (without the double nested G tag) echoes nothing - because the viewBox attribute is actually transformed into the equivalent of a nested G tag, making it equivalent to the previous example:\n<Svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n  <G>\n    <Circle cx={50} cy={50} r={50} fill='#f00' \n        onPress={()=>{console.log(\"i'm touched\")}}/>\n  </G>\n</Svg>\nI was hoping to attempt a fix, but I don't yet understand how everything hangs together.\nI think the problem lies in RNSVGGroupShadowNode at line 96:\n94            viewTag = node.hitTest(point, ((ViewGroup) view).getChildAt(i), combinedMatrix);\n95            if (viewTag != -1) {\n96                return node.isResponsible() ? viewTag : view.getId();\n97            }\nWhen viewTag is != -1 because of a direct child's hitTest, line 96 correctly returns the id of the child. \nHowever, if the viewTag belongs to a more deeply nested descendent then the direct child node (a nested G for example) will return false from isResponsible if it doesn't have e.g. an onPress callback, and the current element will claim the hit.\n. Actually pull-request #102 causes the events to be received on iOS, which is an improvement, but still doesn't map them correctly to the viewBox :-S\n. OK sure - its good to check these things ;) \nIt seems there must be something wrong though - the output from the same SVG code is different between Android and iOS.\nTo replicate, just render this:\n<View style={{flex:1}}>\n          <Svg style={{flex:1}} viewBox='0 0 500 1000'>\n            <Rect x={0} y={0} width={500} height={1000} fill='#f00'/>\n          </Svg>\n        </View>\nOn iOS this will render correctly with the red rectangle centred horizontally. \n\nOn Android it will render the rectangle aligned to the right of the screen (and some of it is off-screen to the right).\n\nWith the matrix operations reversed, Android also renders correctly.\n. This PR does fix a part of the issue: that events were stifled by nested G elements.\nIt doesn't completely fix the viewBox touch mapping though.\nWith this PR applied I do start receiving the touch events again, but the touches are received by the wrong elements if the viewBox has moved them significantly (see the original description of #96).\nI spent a while looking into that problem too.\nFrom what I can see, the CGPoint of the touch event is the pixel position of the touch on the enclosing view. Without a viewBox, or with an identity viewBox, this works and the touch events are received by the correct elements, but once you have a viewBox that transforms the elements  significantly I think maybe the CGPoint needs to be transformed too? \nI tried transforming the CGPoint using the viewBox matrix but it didn't seem to quite work, even though I can see that the transformed point is then within the bounds of the transformed shape. I'm guessing I'm doing something else wrong due to my inexperience with ObjectiveC and iOS in general.\n. OK, cool. I do think it is worth applying this PR though, otherwise events still won't propagate through a G at all ;)\n. So I tracked down and fixed the transform problem before I noticed you'd already committed a fix that was cleaner than mine anyway :) \nWith the addition of this PR to the current master the touch events get passed through G elements and map correctly to the element you are trying to touch.\n. I'm seeing this too (or a very similar problem) - if the Svg element is not positioned in the top-left corner of the screen, the touch coordinates are incorrect (both X and Y).\nThis can be demonstrated easily with the PanExample from this project's documentation - Just place it inside an absolutely positioned View then try moving the star around. As soon as you start moving the shape will jump down and to the right of your actual touch-point. \nIt jitters around a fair bit between the actual touch-point and the incorrect offset position, so it seems like sometimes the correct position is being reported.\nNote that the code for RNSVGSvgView.java has an obvious bug at line 120 but fixing it seems to make no difference to this problem.\n```\nexport default TouchTest = () => {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n\n\n  )\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  root: {\n    flex:1,\n    position:'relative'\n  },\n  absolute:{\n    position:'absolute',\n    left:100,\n    top:100\n  }\n})\n```\n. Thanks - works perfectly!\n. Actually I have a fix for it already (its an easy one) and for another viewBox bug that the fix for this one revealed - I'll create a couple of pull requests later today ;)\n. perfect, thanks!\n. ",

The numbers in the vector path are coordinates in a cartesian plane and it seems like the viewBox is just a definition of a boundry box, that lets the svg know how large your shape is. It could be easily calculated from the path numbers (just simple min-max lookup) but they let it up to you to draw the 'boundries' of the data.. @mnicolls  Technically it's okay to be outside but when you change the width and height to differ from viewBox, everything outside it will get cropped.

A little messy but works none-the-less and is quite performant.\nHere's a simplified version of the solution: \n```js\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\nthis.state = { circleRadius: new Animated.Value(50) };\nthis.state.circleRadius.addListener( (circleRadius) => {\n    this._myCircle.setNativeProps({ r: circleRadius.value.toString() });\n  });\nsetTimeout( () => {\n    Animated.spring( this.state.circleRadius, { toValue: 100, friction: 3 } ).start();\n  }, 2000)\n}\nrender() {\n  return(\n    \n this._myCircle = ref } cx=\"250\" cy=\"250\" r=\"50\" fill=\"black\" />\n    \n  )\n}\n```\nAnd the resulting animation: \n\nAnd this is being rendered on a very complex component where using setState isn't fluid at all.\n.

For simple components, setState may be sufficient but it quickly loses value on more complex components. \nThe advantage of using Animated is that it completes the animation on the UI thread so is more or less unaffected by what else your component is trying to do..

I have implemented a clickable SVG pie chart ;-P\nAFAIK, the tweening functionality could be incorporated into react native svg. It's pure computation with no dependencies on a particular DOM implementation.\n. @edo1493 See my edited comment above.. @edo1493 Yup.

I just re-adapted the whole thing without ART. I am using the onClick events to highlight the slice and make it bigger, it would be nice to have an Animation when the slice gets bigger. .

The key is to format the value correctly and I had to look at the code in https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/tree/master/lib/extract to get it right. All of the transform props had to be converted into a matrix for example. For path data, I used D3 to create paths and interpolate paths.

However, a colour interpolation first needs to be converted to a value or the extractProps chain will not know what to do with it. So the trick in the above example is to use __getValue().

Not sure but first think that get to my mind is that you can use something like onLayout and create ResizableSvg component something like this\n``` jsx\nclass ResizableSvg extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n          super(props);\n          this.state = {\n            width: 0,\n              height: 0,\n            };\n    }\nrender() {\n    const { width, height } = this.state;\n    const isSet = width !== 0 && height !== 0;\n    return (<View \n            style={this.props.style}\n            onLayout={(e) => \n                this.setState({\n                    height: e.nativeEvent.layout.height,\n                    width: e.nativeEvent.layout.width\n                })\n            }\n        >\n          {isSet &&\n        <Svg style={{ width, height }} viewBox={this.props.viewBox}>\n            {this.props.children}\n        </Svg>}\n    </View>);\n}\n\n}\n```\nand then use it something like this\njsx\n<ResizableSvg style={{ flex: 1 }} viewBox={\"0 0 100 100\"}>\n    <Circle r={50} x={50} y={50} fill=\"green\"/>\n</ResizableSvg>\ndemo => https://rnplay.org/apps/MUlcbw\n. Sorry didn't saw your demo, only first time when you open up the issue.\nbtw I don't have access to close issues, you can do it. I am just subscribed because I want to keep track of updates to this lib\n. you have Node.js v7 installed ? os.tmpDir is deprecated \nTry running react-native with Node.js v6\n. duplicated https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/157\n.

The error disappeared after a reboot. I think that the problem could have been that the React Packager Server might have been running when I issued the rnpm link command.\n. @designingSparks I didn't actually cope with the matrix algebra needed, so I'm using a library for the calculations.\nhttps://gitlab.com/epistemex/transformation-matrix-js\nThis library let's you chain your transforms and gives a matrix back to you. Get hold of a ref to your svg component (I'm moving around G-elements). Use the components of the returned matrix as input to setNativeProps like this:\n```js\nconst matrix = new Matrix()\n  .translate(x, y)\n  .rotateDeg(45)\n  .scaleU(0.5);\nthis.svgGroupRef.setNativeProps({\n  matrix: [matrix.a, matrix.b, matrix.c, matrix.d, matrix.e, matrix.f], //[scaleX, 0, 0, scaleY, x, y],\n});\n```\nThe comment \"[scaleX, ..\" is only roughly what the components means. It serves as a reminder of what goes where, but don't use it as the complete truth of the components.\nEdit: I managed to find the original discussion, which helped me with this:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/556#issuecomment-354099452\n. This is a problem to me as well. I'm rendering SVG on top of a large image. When I leave the view I get back all allocated memory from the image (jpg), but the SVG allocation is not released.\nIs this fixed in 6.0.0? I haven't had time to upgrade. If I knew this leak was fixed I'd upgrade asap.\nI'm sorry, I don't have enough knowledge to give this a shot myself. Thank you for your great work.. I went ahead and upgraded to RN 0.50.3 and RN-SVG 6.0.0. No difference. Still leaking :(. Any ideas on what's going on? Should we implement 5+ in any other fashion than 4+ to work around the leak?. @dustinsavery \nI have now isolated the problem in a new minimal app. The problem is the same in 5.5.1 and 6.0.1rc1.\nPlatform: iOS\nRN: 0.51\nLeaks in both simulator and on device\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Created a bare-bone app with create-react-native-app\n2. Eject the app to a regular react-native app\n3. npm i react-native-svg --save\n4. npm i\n5. react-native link\nThis is the code I put directly in App.js:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';\nimport Svg, { Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = { counter: 0 };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <View style={{ height: 50 }} />\n        <Button\n          title={'Re-render ' + this.state.counter}\n          onPress={() => {\n            this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 });\n          }}\n        />\n        {this.state.counter % 2 === 0 && (\n          <Svg height=\"1000\" width=\"1000\">\n            <Circle\n              cx=\"200\"\n              cy=\"150\"\n              r={10 + this.state.counter}\n              strokeWidth=\"2.5\"\n              stroke=\"#101010\"\n              fill=\"red\"\n            />\n          </Svg>\n        )}\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThe key is to hide/reveal the SVG. If the same SVG is just re-rendered, there is no problem. But every time the SVG is rendered from scratch (i.e. it was not rendered previously), the memory footprint increases.\nI made the SVG quite big to emphasise the problem.\nHere is a screenshot from XCode Instruments after five re-renders. As you can see there SVG has five persistent objects totaling 343 MB.\n\n. I have found that using a very large Svg element takes up a lot of memory. It seems that Svg takes almost double the amount of memory it takes to show a jpg image of the same size. On top of that there is a nasty leak in RNSVG #278. \nThe Svg not rendering is probably memory related. The same thing happens when you try to render very large images.\nI'm now using a screen sized Svg element and transform my content to match the scroll position. It works great.. Yes, you can. But I'd advice against it. Your large svg will eat a lot of memory (more than the same sized jpg would eat). As of now there is also a bug so you won't get that memory back when you unmount your view. (#278)\nWhy do you need such large svg? I think that you can accomplish very much with a screen sized svg and working with transforms (scale and translate) to show the portion of your \"virtual\" large svg that you want.\nI've been in many svg rabbit holes. The \"very large svg\"-hole was no success. The only use for a very large svg is when I need to generate a large sized png with good resolution. When I do this I need to care about not having a lot of other stuff in memory, i.e. no images (especially no transparent pngs). Thank you so much! It works great.. BTW. I had this on SO as well. I you'd like to chime in there I'll accept your answer.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47981530/transform-g-with-setnativeprops-possible-with-react-native-svg/47991473#47991473. I just struggled with this and found a comment about this from @msand. In #475.\nEasiest workaround for now is to use \"rotation\" instead of \"rotate. Also, there is no support for the x and y parameters, but I thik you can use originX and originY instead.\ntransform={{ rotation: 45, originX: 5, originY: 5 }}\nedit: I see now that you are rendering \"Rect\". Rotate still works for Rect, I think. But you'll need originX and originY anyway.. Great, thanks.\nIs the support for rotation center new, or did I just miss it before?. I'm can't make that work in my setup. If I knew it would give much better performance I'd put some more work into it.\nThis is what I do (simplified):\n<View  (screen sized)>\n  <Svg (screen sized)>\n    <G ref={ref => (this.svgGroupRef = ref)}>\n      {this.shapes.map(shape => {\n        if (!shape.isVisible) return null;\n        return <MyShape />;\n      })}\n    </G>\n  </Svg>\n</View>;\n\n\nMyShape does never re-render (shouldComponentUpdate => false)\nSince <G> does not have a dimension per se, it can live inside of a screen sized Svg and still scale infinitely with vector resolution.\nAll transforms are done with setNativeProps\n\nThe problem with transforming the outer view is that I'd transform the whole Svg as well. The Svg component seems to allocate memory in accordance to it's size. <G> on the other hand does not (G seems to behave about the same as ART.Surface in that regard)\nIn my example I have about 1000 shapes. They are quite simple, a rect with round corners a line from the rect and a number inside of the rect. Before rendering everything I'm calculating the boundingRect for all shapes so I can quickly decide if a shape is visible or not.\nIf I skip the text rendering I get good performance. But as soon as I render the text I get very poor  performance.\nWhat do you mean by \"cached output of text rendering\"? This seems to be exactly what I have looked for. How do I accomplish this?. Thanks.\nI debugged this in XCode (iOS simulator).\nTo ensure that I hadn't goofed I put a render-counter in the components render function. I can confirm that the component is only rendered one time.\nI've simplified the component so the only thing inside of my <G> is a <Text> with the string \"1\".\nI'm passing the if (_cache) {.. four times as per the below:\n1. _cache === false\n2. _cache === true\n3. _cache === false\n4. _cache === true\nThese four passes happens when I first render the view. On each following setNativeProps (only X- and Y translation) I pass this section twice. First with no cache and then with _cache === true.. No, I only set it on the G component. The whole purpose is to proportionally transform all components within the G.. Thanks.\nI'm trying hard to follow the code (I've never looked at objC before).\nTried to compare TSpan with Rect, but now I understand even less. \n\nRect gets invalidated on every change in x, y, width, etc and has no _cache.\nTSpan gets invalidated on setContent() and has some magic autorelease for _cache.\n\nI assume that setNativeProps will bypass setX, setWidth etc on Rect? Where should I look in the code to try to understand where setNativeProps does it's magic? One idea on the bad performance could be that Text doesn't share the same behaviour regarding setNativeProps, hence re-renders every time.. Wow! That seems really great. Let me know if I can help out with something.. Would your proposed solution make my use of setNativeProps obsolete? If that would be the case I could switch to PureComponent instead of Component. As of now I'm prohibiting component updates via shouldComponentUpdate in the case when I only want to change the matrix (i.e via setNativeProps).. Ok, I'm with you regarding the performance tests. I could try to whip something up. Do you know of if there are any APIs in RN for measuring actual fps? I'm thinking of making a simple app with a bunch of Rect and Text elements which are animated over the screen, but I don't know how to measure performance objectively.\nThe other stuff (ensure paths are cached etc) is out of my league. I've never worked with objectiveC.. @msand Sorry for taking long time to answer. I've been away skiing. \nThis is awesome news. I will try it out first thing next week. I will also try to make time for some kind of objective performance testing.. @msand Just an update.. I've been overloaded with work and I haven't had time to do any tests. This topic is very important to me, so I'll give it a good test for sure. I'm hoping to be out of this work load in a week or two.. @msand I upgraded from 6.2.2. to 6.3.1. There is something really fishy with text rendering. When I move around my shapes (dragging with fingers) the text is rendered at wrong positions (i.e. out of whack) on iOS, but it works as it should in the simulator. I don't know where to start looking for the problem. \nWould you like me to send you a screen recording from the app before /after upgrade?. I recorded a screen capture. When I did this I noticed a pattern. It seems like some text is transformed along the wrong axis. Example: I have a rect with text inside. When I move the rect upwards (negative y), the text moves to the left (negative x) and vice versa. This occurs with text that is transformed (rotated). Straight (non rotated) text stays in one spot, i.e. it does not move with the rect at all.\nPlease tell me if you want to take a look at the recordings.. I managed to make some gifs. The first one is with RNSVG 6.2.2. Notice  the number in the rectangle as well as the measurement along the grey line.\n\nThe exact same codebase but with RNSVG 6.3.1. Notice that the number in the rectangle stays in it's original position, i.e. it's not transformed at all. The measurement is transformed along the wrong axis.\n\nThe transformations that are performed are as follows:\n\n\nThe complete SVG is transformed via setNativeProps with a matrix. This seems to work as it should, otherwise there would be no text visible.\n\n\nThe text position is calculated from the same props as the coordinates for the rect. The rect behaves as it should, so I conclude that this calculation is performed timely and correctly.\n\n\n(A) The text in the rect transformed once again with <SvgText transform={{scale: someScaleFactor}}>\n\n\n(B) The measurement text along the line is transformed like the number in the rect, but also with transform on it's outer group like this <G transform={{rotation, originX, originY}}>\n\n\nSo..\nI think there are two problems here:\nA. The text that is only transformed once gets stale. Some trouble in the cache invalidation perhaps?\nB. When the text is transformed again its cache seems to be invalidated correctly, but the axis for transformX vs transformY seems to be mixed up.\nN.B. The problem seems to be in the iOS codebase since everything works as expected in the simulator. I don't have possibility to try it out on Android.. @msand This thread is getting really long. Should I post the last problem as a separate issue? Please tell me if I can do anything more to help.. I'm back to this issue after working on some other stuff. There are two problems. I think that the second one is kind of the same issue as #709. \n\n\nI'll go on and try to bisect the problem with the seemingly exchanged axis on the rotated text element.\n\n\nI have zoomed in on the problem with the missing re-rendering of the text in the rect. It turns out that the <Text> element does not trigger a re-render when the x- or y-props are changed. This worked better in older versions. An ugly temporary solution is to assign a unique key property to the text.. I have now bisected the commits. This took some work, because not every committed version was runnable. I'm down to two suspects, which is as far as I can get.\n\n\nWorking as expected:\nThe last working commit was 149f460 - Improve path cashing on android. \nCrashing:\nThe next commit is not runnable, db8f1da - Improve path caching ios. As soon as an SVG element should render the app freezes, sometimes with a black screen.\nNot working as expected:\nThe commit after this is cd43fc1 - Optimize hit testing. This commit has the two bugs shown in my gifs above.\nConclusion:\nThe bug was introduced in either db8f1da or cd43fc1.\n@msand do you get any clues from this?\nShould I post this as a separate issue, or keep it in this thread?. Is there anything more I can do? You don't want me in the native code, trust me :)\nShould I post the actual bugs as a separate issue to get attention from others that might be able to help out?. Regarding reverting the caching logic: \nIf this is avoidable it would be good. Text rendering was suffering hard from excessive redrawing before your caching fix. I haven't had time for any performance tests yet, though. So I actually don't know how much the caching brings in terms of FPS.. The problems that came with the new caching solution are now solved by @msand. See comments in #709 \nI'll leave this issue open, as I think it's better to close it when the fix arrives in a published version.. @msand, wow thanks!\nThis is very interesting. For now I have ok performance, but I will need to increase the speed when we take on larger projects (i.e more svg shapes). It would also be good with a bit more speed for users with older devices.\nI'll dig into this, for sure.. Update.\nI can confirm that 6.0.0 is also broken.\nI see quite some changes in clipping calculations in the change log. In my app I render everything in a small scale <G> and transform it to fit my Svg on screen on every render. It's kind of a manual viewBox. Could my render be omitted due to som cliprect calculations that are taking place before the transform of my <G>element?. I'm sorry. I have to take back \"works in 5.5.1\". I had forgotten a workaround in the code. (I'll change the subject line as well). This workaround makes the problem almost go away, and that's what I saw in 5.5.1, i.e. the problem was not gone for real.\nThe workaround:\nI'm rendering a \"selection-box\" around a shape if it is selected. The render function looks like this simplified:\nreturn (\n  <G>\n    {this.props.isSelected && this.renderSelectionBox()}\n    {this.renderShape()}\n  </G>\n);\n\nThe problem is that when isSelected changes to false and the shape is moved at the same time, the selectionbox is left on the screen on it's old position. If I manually re-render after this, the box goes away, so apparently something is able to clean it up.\nThe ugly workaround is to not render \"null\", but instead render an empty Rect like this. \n- The empty rect needs to have the same key as the one that was previously rendered.\n- I tried with an empty <G> but it didn't work.\n```\nrender() {\n  return (\n    \n      {this.renderSelectionBox(this.props.isSelected)}\n      {this.renderShape()}\n    \n  );\n}\nrenderSelectionBox(isSelected) {\n  //if no rect should be renderd, render a non visible rect as a place holder\n  if (!isSelected) return ;\n//otherwise render the real Rect\n  return (\n    ``. I've tried withshouldComponentUpdate = () => true`, but that shouldn't be needed since forceUpdate should bypass shouldComponentUpdate.\nAs I said it's a quite large code base. Therefore I suspected that the bug was mine at first. It still might be, due to my special handling of forceUpdate. Here is some background:\nI have thousands of shapes to render, so I can only afford to render the shapes that are visible at a given time (depending on the current transform). It turned out that it wasn't enough (performance vise) to just return null from the components that are not visible, so I keep all my shape definitions in an array of \"shapeControllers\" with pre-calculated data for the shape (such as bounding box etc). \nAt every render I let every shapeController decide if their shape would be visible on screen. If so I will create a component (typically a G with some Rects and Lines). Once the component is created (i.e. visible) it will only be moved/scaled via setNativeProps.\nBut when the user interacts with a shape I give the shape new coordinates directly (not via props) and force them to re-render via forceUpdate. I've tried to do the update via setState on a ref to the component, but I still get the strange behaviour.\nWell... this seems kind of messy, I know. But everything works like a charm with great performance. The only bad thing is this strange behaviour. I realise that I need to try to isolate the problem.. I'll try my best and get back when I have more information..  I'm actually already doing it on the parent since I need to loop all shapeControllers to see if anyone is altered, as the shapes can interact with each other as well. If a shapeController has recalculated it's shapedata it will have a new calcVersion which is sent as props to the component to trigger a re-render. The calcVersion is bumped whenever the controllers invalidate()is called.. Thanks again. It makes sense. \nI'll do a rewrite to use more of the normal lifecycle. But I'll keep away from Immutable in this case. I'm using Immutable.js, Redux and Redux Saga everywhere else in the app. But after some benchmarking I opted away from Immutable int the 60fps scenarios. Plain JS is much faster in my tests. Here are some examples (timing on my MacBook Pro).\nA = Immutable.List of 1000 objects\nB = plain array of 1000 objects\nThe objects looks like this:\n``\n{\n  plain: plan js version of my shape object\n  im: immutable map version of my shape object\n}\n````\nIterate B once withfor (shape of B)`and read 10 fields from the plain object vs the im object:\nreading plain: 0.38 ms\nreading im: 1.31 ms\nIterate A once with A.map(shape=>...\nread im: 2.87 ms\nThis is why I opted for a surrogate flag for change detection calcVersion. I'm doing work directly in my array and I'm mutating the objects. For each mutation I increase the calcVersion of the object. CalcVersion is sent into my shape component as a prop together with the mutated object.\nMy original collection is an Immutable.list in redux. The first thing I do when the list arrives to my component is to clone the list and make a plain array containing the data I need. When new versions of this list arrives from Redux I have a plain JS Map with my shapeGuids as keys as an index for speedy change detection.\nI know that Immutable.js uses structural sharing for efficiency, but there is still too much overhead involved in keeping stuff immutable when time is critical.\nHave I missed something in my reasoning?\nedit: \nThe im reading is only shallow .get('fieldname'). I didn't try .getIn([...]), but this would of course slow things down even more.\nTime is measured with process.hrtime() in node.js.. @msand Thank you so much for your advice. Everything works perfect after following your advice. I did a major refactor and converted my ShapeCollection class into a regular React Component. Every render is now initiated via setState() and I got rid of all of the forceUpdate(). Lesson learned... No, I keep a healthy distance to pods. They have given me nothing but trouble.\nI went back to 6.1.4 and it works now. I'll give the upgrade a new shot and get back here with the outcome. The reason for my eager upgrade was that I suddenly cant run my app in release mode. It crashes without any information. \n. Thanks 6.2.1 works for me.. Sorry, my bad :/\nI had used my Component on another place (building a menu with four menu items). The menu didn't register the symbols as it should.. It works great!. I have a temporary workaround for my use case. Not great, but it works.\nBy svg library in my database consists of html5 compliant SVG data, since I need to use the shapes on the web as well. When I fetch these svg files into my RN app I parse them and convert them into <Symbol> elements which I can reuse in my <Svg>. \nIn my first attempt I reused the viewBox from the svg-file and applied it to my Symbol element. This got me into trouble as per above when the original viewBox was offset from 0;0.\nMy workaround is to calculate a transform from the viewBox-data. I apply the transform to the childs of my Symbol so I can reset the viewBox to 0;0-based. Essentially I'm recreating the viewBox behaviour with a transform and take the translateX/translateY responsibility away from the viewBox.. Thanks @msand !\nI figured I'd missed something. Unfortunately I cannot wrap my head around this anyway. As you say, it works fine if I keep the aspect ratio by stating width and height accordingly.\nMy use case is an icon library. When I render the icons via <Use> in the <Svg> I don't want to state width and height. I only want to state size and get an icon with correct aspect ratio according to its viewBox.\nI tried to use preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" as a prop to yhe <Use> element, but I didn't get it to work. Does the preserveAspectRatio work differently on Svg compared to Use?\nBTW. All the examples in your links are using viewPorts which starts at 0;0. I only get into trouble when I need to move the viewBox as in my example.. There has to be something more that I'm missing. This does not make sense to me.\n- aspect ratio could be derived from the viewBox data\n- I don't have this viewBox information from outside of the component\n- so I need to store the aspect ratio along with my icon definition so I can input this information to the Use element\n```\n\n  //this component parses an svg file and outputs an \n\n\n    //This is where I need to input width and height according to the aspect ratio of the Symbol\n    \n\n. Ok, so there is no way to use the aspect ratio for a Symbol from the Use element?\nWhen I input the width and height props on a Use element it manages to scale the Symbol correctly. Did they (the svg people) forget that we might want to preserve the aspect ration in this scaling operation? . The example was simplified. I have hundreds of Use of the same symbol. I gained a lot of performance by moving them to Symbol definitions.\nThere are no children to SvgSymbolFromXml. My fault. I corrected the code above.\nThe Symbol element is the one that has a viewBox. I tried to set preserveAspectRatio there as well, but it didn't seem to have any effect.. @msand As usual you have been really helpful. \nI now realise that I'm going to need the aspect ratio for other calculations (other shapes connecting to the icon). I'm going to send it in as a prop to the component that renders the Use elements.. Fixed in 9.0.0. @msand Could it be possible that toDataURL is broken in the latest version? I think I got it right, but I get the following red screen. I haven't tried this with an earlier version yet. Should I try with an earlier RNSVG version, or do you have any clue of what could be wrong?\nI'm calling toDataURL in componentDidUpdate. At this stage in the lifecycle everything should be ready, shouldn't it?\n\n. It works in onLayout. Thanks a bunch!. Having to set a random key to get the text element to re-render seems like an ugly workaround. It goes against the main idea to only re-render what's necessary.\nI have a similar problem when moving text elements, i.e. changing the x- and y props of the text. These props does not seem to trigger a re-render so I have to (temporarily) set a random key as @mcihan proposes.. @msand Do you have anything you'd like me to try out on iOS, similar to the code-lines you wanted remove in Java in your above post? I'm building for iOS only at the moment, so I can't help you out with the Java test.\nBtw, I couldn't get the TSpan trick to work. Didn't put that much time into it, but I couldn't even get the text to render in the correct position. It might have to do with the transformation I'm doing on both the wrapping Text element and the outer wrapping Group element.. I installed your version, restarted the packager as well in case you'd changed something at the native side.\nBoth my problems persists, i.e.:\n- Text elements are not rerendered when x/y props are changed\n- Matrix transformed Text elements seems to have x and y mixed up (when x/y changes)\nI'll give the TSpan another go. I'm not sure what x and y I should put into the TSpan. My wrapping Text element already has x and y as well as a scale transform.. If I wrap the text string in a TSpan without applying x and y props to the TSpan, the text is rendered at the correct place. But the Text does not rerender when x/y changes on the wrapping Text.\nI suppose that your workaround needs the x and y props to be applied to the TSpan and those props are what should be altered. Correct? If I move x, y and transform from the outer Text to the inner TSpan nothing seems to change. No rerendering when x and y changes.\nHere is my code. It's straight cut and pasted so I wouldn't mess upp any vital information to you. I.e. You'll have to wade through some irrelevant constants etc.\n    <SvgText\n      textAnchor={'middle'}\n      fontSize={fontSize * VIRTUAL_TEXT_SCALE}\n      fill={ghostedProps ? ghostedProps.textColor : controlpointLevel.text}\n      strokeDasharray={strokeDashArray}\n    >\n      <TSpan\n        transform={{ scale: 1 / VIRTUAL_TEXT_SCALE }}\n        x={this.props.labelCenter.x * VIRTUAL_TEXT_SCALE}\n        y={(this.props.labelCenter.y + labelVerticalAdjustment) * VIRTUAL_TEXT_SCALE}\n      >\n        {this.props.labelText}\n      </TSpan>\n    </SvgText>\n\nThe above plus some other Svg elements is wrapped into a G element which in turn is scaled and translated with setNativeProps({matrix: ..})\n. Hmm. I'm not sure what happened now. Maybe my first attempt to install ce602c1 went wrong due to some build cache or something. After restarting the packager and the app again, someething went wrong. The app didn't even start.\nI got an error stating that the NSString '12' could not be converted to an YGValue. 12 is a quite common fontSize in my app, but after searching everywhere I cannot find any place where I'm applying the fontsize as a string.. How do I rebuild? Should I do a \"build\" from XCode?. Oh, that's exactly what I did.\n1. Closed packager\n2. Close simulator\n3. react-native run-ios to start packager and the app.\nWhile waiting for your last reply I went ahead and reinstated [self invalidate]; instead of [container invalidate]; as you suggested in the other issue. This didn't change anything regarding the two bugs.. I reinstalled msand/react-native-svg#ce602c1 again and issued a build from XCode. Got rid of the error message and the app works. But everything behaves as before.\nHow can I confirm that I really have installed the intended version? Any specific code I could look at to verify?. I'll try this in a couple of days. With a bit of luck I might be able to implement a minimal version of my use-case and recreate the bugs in a separate project. I'll put the project in a separate repo.. @msand Kiitos! \nYou're the hero of today.\nMy two big problems went away.\n- Text is re-rendered even if only x and y are set via setNativeProps\n- Text that are transformed via setNativeProps and a matrix does no longer get \"mixed up\" axis while moving. @msand I installed your patch (d0a9cba), but unfortunately this didn't solve my two problems. I checked the code in node_modules to ensure that I got your patch. I also deleted ios/build to ensure no cache problems prevented your code to build.\nI hope I can find time this week to set up a new app project and try to recreate my problems as cleanly as possible.. @msand Sorry for being late to the game. Every performance optimisation is great news to me. Unfortunately I ran into a wall here. I don't know where to start searching.\nThis is what I get when I mount the \"drawing view\" in my app using RNSVG 7.2\n\nI have searched through my code in the hope to find any place where I have used strings instead of numbers. I only found one place, but changing this to numbers didn't fix the problem.\nThe reason I have one place where I'm using strings is that width and height of <Use> did not accept numbers previously. Should I use numbers in 7.2?\nHere is my previous workaround in order to get Useto work:\n<Use\n        href={this.getSymbolHref()}\n        transform={transform}\n        x={pos.x}\n        y={pos.y}\n        width={pos.symbolSize + ''}\n        height={pos.symbolSize + ''}\n      />\nDo you have any clues of what to look for?. I have dug into this. I managed to isolate the problem to a very simple line drawing.\nThis works:\nreturn (\n      <G>\n        <Line x1={'10'} y1={'40'} x2={'40'} y2={'40'} stroke={'gray'} strokeWidth={8} />\n      </G>\n    );\nThis does not work:\nreturn (\n      <G>\n        <Line x1={10} y1={40} x2={40} y2={40} stroke={'gray'} strokeWidth={8} />\n      </G>\n    );\nThe coordinates must be strings to work. The strokeWidth can be numerical, though.\nI also got the below warning:\nI have set pointerEvents to \"none\" on my Svg element. I don't set pointerEvents at G elements, though. This seems to be something RNSVG does internaly.\n\nThis is how the properties of my Svg element is set:\n```\n<Svg\n  width={data.viewPortRect.width()}\n  height={data.viewPortRect.height()}\n  pointerEvents={'none'}\n\n``. I have the same issue, but only in XCode. I can run the app in the simulator viareact-native run-ios`.\n\nI have tried:\n- react-native unlink react-native-svg\n- npm remove react-native-svg\n- close metro packager\n- rm -rf ./ios/build\n- npm install react-native-svg\n- react-native unlink react-native-svg\nThe library seems to be removed correctly in xcode, and then added correctly again. No red libraries in \"Link Binary With Libraries\" in XCode.\n\n. Switching to \"Legacy Build System\" in XCode (File/Project Settings) solved the problem\n@msand Is there anything I can do to help you find the build problem? I suspect that there are drawbacks with the legacy system, or that this build system won't be around in the future.\nSidenote: Subjectively I feel that my, quite SVG heavy app, performs better with v8 than it did with v6. I'd really like to get some time to setup some objective tests. It's on my list, but right now \"the list\" is quite long.. Ok, sounds like a plan.\nYou might want to consider inting about \"Legacy Build System\" in the install section in the docs. I suspect this issue will become very hot otherwise.\nI have been using the latest XCode without \"Legacy..\" for a couple of weeks now. No issues whatsoever with RN 0.56 (until the RNSVG issue).. No difference after changing the file order. \nI removed the build folder before re-building.. I can't find that screen for RNSVG. In the scheme settings for my project the Parallelize setting is already unchecked. Are there scheme settings for each library, or does your project just happen to have \"RNSVG\" as it's name?. After just trying to build a couple of times, while looking around tor settings I got this:\n\n. Found the scheme settings for RNSVG. \n- unchecked Parallelize\n- removed ./ios/build\n- Tried to build -> same problem (RNSVGLength.h..). Success..\nI did the same thing again, but this time I used Product/Clean Build Folder from within XCode instead of just rm -rf the folder. The project now builds successfully with \"Parallelize\" unchecked in the RNSVG package.\nI wonder what trickery the \"Clean Build Folder\" does besides cleaning the build folder..\n. I had this problem as well, but it went away when I upgraded from RNSVG 7 to 8.. For what it's worth, I ran your SVG through svgo and got an equal image, half the file size and with simpler SVG code. All the SVGs I import into my app goes through svgo. I've found that I get smaller SVG files with less problems. I actually run them twice through svgo. It seems that some optimization possibilities are not identified at the first run.\nYour SVG after svgo\nxml\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" \n  xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" width=\"20\" height=\"27\">\n  <defs>\n    <polygon id=\"b\" points=\"0 0 16 0 16 23 7.82151442 14.698999 0 23\"/>\n    <filter id=\"a\" width=\"143.8%\" height=\"130.4%\" x=\"-21.9%\" y=\"-10.9%\" filterUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\">\n      <feOffset dy=\"1\" in=\"SourceAlpha\" result=\"shadowOffsetOuter1\"/>\n      <feGaussianBlur in=\"shadowOffsetOuter1\" result=\"shadowBlurOuter1\" stdDeviation=\"1\"/>\n      <feColorMatrix in=\"shadowBlurOuter1\" values=\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.2 0\"/>\n    </filter>\n  </defs>\n  <g fill=\"none\">\n    <g transform=\"translate(2 1)\">\n      <use fill=\"#000\" filter=\"url(#a)\" xlink:href=\"#b\"/>\n      <use fill=\"#FFC944\" xlink:href=\"#b\"/>\n    </g>\n    <path fill=\"#FFF\" stroke=\"#FFC944\" d=\"M10.117 13.123l-2.61 1.373c-.977.513-1.617.046-1.43-1.04l.498-2.906-2.112-2.058c-.79-.77-.544-1.524.546-1.682l2.919-.424 1.305-2.644c.488-.99 1.28-.989 1.768 0l1.305 2.644 2.918.424c1.092.159 1.336.912.547 1.682l-2.112 2.058.498 2.906c.187 1.088-.455 1.552-1.43 1.04l-2.61-1.373z\"/>\n  </g>\n</svg>\nHere are the params I use for svgo:\n```javascript\nconst SVGO = require('svgo');\nlet fs = require('fs');\nconst fileName = process.argv[2];\nsvgo = new SVGO({\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      cleanupAttrs: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeDoctype: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeXMLProcInst: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeComments: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeMetadata: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeTitle: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeDesc: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeUselessDefs: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeEditorsNSData: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeEmptyAttrs: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeHiddenElems: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeEmptyText: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeEmptyContainers: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeViewBox: true,\n    },\n    {\n      cleanUpEnableBackground: true,\n    },\n    {\n      convertStyleToAttrs: false, //do not activate!\n    },\n    {\n      convertColors: true,\n    },\n    {\n      convertPathData: true,\n    },\n    {\n      convertTransform: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeUnknownsAndDefaults: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeNonInheritableGroupAttrs: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeUselessStrokeAndFill: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeUnusedNS: true,\n    },\n    {\n      cleanupIDs: true,\n    },\n    {\n      cleanupNumericValues: true,\n    },\n    {\n      moveElemsAttrsToGroup: true,\n    },\n    {\n      moveGroupAttrsToElems: true,\n    },\n    {\n      collapseGroups: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeRasterImages: true,\n    },\n    {\n      mergePaths: true,\n    },\n    {\n      convertShapeToPath: false,\n    },\n    {\n      sortAttrs: true,\n    },\n    {\n      transformsWithOnePath: true,\n    },\n    {\n      removeDimensions: true,\n    },\n  ],\n});\nfs.readFile(fileName, (err, file) => {\n  if (err) return console.log(err);\nconst svg = file.toString();\n  const opt = svgo.optimize(svg).then((result1) => {\n    const opt2 = svgo.optimize(result1.data).then((result2) => {\n      fs.writeFileSync('./out.svg', result2.data);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\nEdit:\nN.B. I haven't actually tried the optimized SVG with RN. It might still have the problem since the xlink is still there. \nAnd.. sorry, I inserted the wrong SVG at first. Now fixed... I tried to follow the code in the hope to find any clues. But I found nothing. Does anyone know where to look for this odd behaviour?\nSince the enlargement is exactly 3 times in both width and height I thought I'd find anything related to RGB. I don't know anything of the PNG format, but I suppose an RGB file is 3 times larger than a B/W file (not taking compression differences into account). Could this factor have been erroneously used when calculating pixel width and height somewhere? \n@msand can you push me in the right direction?\nEdit:\nActually, I'll take my RGB thought back. There is an Alpha channel in PNGs as well, isn't it? In that case my RGB theory is no good. I guess I had bad luck when I tried to think.. I think a parameter would be great. I think there are two distinct use cases for toDataUrl().\n\n\nCreate a bitmap for local use in the app, i.e. show on the same screen it was captured on\n\n\nCreate a bitmap for external use (outside of the app) where you need a specific resolution. @msand strikes again =)\nTo me, this is a perfect solution. Thank you very much. I won't dig into this part of my app in another week or two. Should I use your branch, or will you merge this into master anytime soon?. Ok, sure.\nI'm in the middle of a release, so I won't have time to try out your branch until the end of the week. I'll ping back here as soon as I've tested.. Sorry for the delay on my side, I'm swamped for the moment..\nTrying this out right now, but It's not working for me.\n\n\nEverything seems to work as usual if I omit the size object in the toDataUrl call.\nWhen I apply a size object the following happens:\n1. The svg image gets cropped, not resized\n2. The size is still 3x the size I enter (in simulator with iPhoneX device)\n. More info..\n\n\nIf I specify a viewBox to cover the size of the svg I get rit of the cropping problem\nN.B.1. If I don't supply your new size parameter to toDataURL there is no need for a viewBox\nN.B.2. There seems to be no need for width='100% and size='100%, is 100% implied?\n\n\nThe output size is still 3x the size I specify in the size parameter\n\n\n. > Btw, I've added support for calling toDataUrl already in the ref function, don't have to wait for onLayout in javascript anymore.\nKind of works..\n\nIf I draw a simple rect in the Svg, this rect will be included in the base64 output.\nMore advanced rendering is not included (In my case a map of special svg-components is missing). Maybe because of the async nature of .map()?\n\nIf I call toDataUrl in onLayout, all components are included in the base64 output.\n. @msand I'm sorry, but this version gets me into more trouble. Somehow my since long trusted rendering loop is now delayed at least one tick. My SVG objects are not rendered until I pan the screen, i.e. forces a re-render. The first render doesn't seem to happen.\nThis part in my app has been stable for a long time, so I suspect something fishy is going on in your develop branch. Do you have any clues, or should I try to isolate the problem (might take a while)?. In that case I suspect that something was lingering in my cache again. The cache seems to bite me quite often when I jump in and out of different versions libraries. I've just found some new magic that might help. I'll give it a go later today and report back here.\nThe new magic:\nrm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-* && rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-map-* \nIt seems that the cache is problematic for more than me. I really hope that this can be addressed in RN going forward. https://gist.github.com/jarretmoses/c2e4786fd342b3444f3bc6beff32098d\n. Update:\nAll leaks except the four smallest has a stack trace which ends with renderLayoutTo:rect:\n\nOne of the stack traces:\n\n. While testing some fixes by @msand (PR #897 ), I'm not able to reproduce the above leaks. I performed the same app interactions as above and got the following:\n\nI think this confirms that the leaks are fixed.. Fixed in 9.0.0. Will do.. But my app is not on Android currently. Would potential regressions affect iOS as well?. That sounds fantastic!\nIf you\u2019re not in a hurry to release I\u2019d be glad to help with some testing. I can do it on monday or maybe tuesday.\n. @msand Is the transform center fix related to #646 ?\n. @msand when you say that memory retention needs to be analyzed, do you mean that this PR could fix  #893 ?. @msand I have gone through the critical svg renderings in my app and found no regressions. Everything seems to work as usual. \nI'll go on with some subjective performance tests and some memory analysis and report back here. Unfortunately, I have not yet had time to come up with an objective performance test. This is still on my todo list.. #893 seems to be fixed by this PR.. I still cannot get <Use>to work with rotation transforms as per #646 . I'm not certain if this PR was aimed to fix this or if I have made some error. @msand are you able to rotate Use elements with correct pivot point?. Subjectively I see no performance boost. It's of course hard to see this by eye, but if the PR would , for example, have doubled the rendering performance I would have seen it. If there is a boost in the range of a couple of 10% I'm not sure I'd pick it up by eye.. The latest commit actually broke the Use rendering. Even without any transformation the object is rendered in another coordinate system, i.e. not relative to the the enclosing group. I'm only seeing part of the symbol on screen but it seems that the x and y of the <Use> element is related to the root SVG instead of the parent <G>element. . I tried the latest commit as well (I saw the small iOS fix in this Android commit), but my positioning of <Use> element is still broke. It did change, though. My elements are now rendered in the lower right instead of the upper left corner (no transform applied to the Use element, but a parent Group (actually a grand-parent) has a scale transform.. Hmm. I'll try to give an example. My usage is quite complicated. In the latest official RNSVG version my Use elements are rendered correctly if I don't try to rotate them.\nHere is roughly my hierarchy of elements:\n<Svg>\n   <Symbol> a bunch of symbol defiinitions\n   <G> scaled and translated via setNativeProps({matrix: ..})\n      <Circle> The two circles in the image below\n      <Use> using the symbols here\nLooking closer at the misplacement of the symbols it seems to be a scaling problem. Both the two circles and the two symbols in the below image are rendered in the same position and in the same parent Group element. (in latest official RNSVG the symbols sits right in the middle of the circles)\nThey are not completely misplaced. Instead they seem to have roughly double the scale. The symbols are positioned about double the distance from top left compared to the circles. They also seem to have roughly double the distance between them compared to the rings. \n\n. I did restart the packager. Should I have deleted the ios/build folder as well?. Good catch Mikael. I did a \"Clean build folder\" and a build from within XCode. It now works as before. But the pivot point still seems to be at the 0,0 of the root Svg and not 0,0 of the parent Group. Which should it be?\nHere is 45 degree rotation:\n\n. BTW. is the watchman and folder removals something that needs to be done everytime a native package is updated?. My bad!\nI thought I had the circle in a group which was positioned further out in the coordinate system. It turned out that X and Y of the parent group is in the upper left corner of the drawing.\nEverything works perfectly when I add originX and originY to the transform.\nI'd say ship it :)\n@msand Thank you soo much for your outstanding work with RNSVG!. Im using this form:\ntransform={{\n          rotation: 45,\n          originX: this.props.labelCenter.x,\n          originY: this.props.labelCenter.y,\n        }}\nWould I gain anything by using the string version transform=\"(rotate(45, 10, 10))\" as in your example?. Apart from the rare possibility of a bug in this PR, the only breaking change would be if someone already has solved the <Use> problem with some kind of workaround. \nSuch a workaround would have been quite complicated and the person doing it would probably have searched the Issues section before tampering with the workaround.\nTo me this is not major. Expo is relying on RNSVG quite a bit, I think. Maybe @ide have any thoughts on major vs minor.. Reading through your changes I noticed a fix for numeric font size handling. I was hoping that this would fix a problem of mine, but it didn't.\nHere is my problem:\nI store all my drawing metadata as if they lived in a 1x1 coordinate system. I.e. everything is really small. When I render this on screen I scale up everyting to the correct size.\nI have a workaround to handle font sizes. In my \"virtual\" 1x1 system a typical fontSize could be 0.003. Apparently, this is too small so I have to apply it as fontSize*1000 and then transform the text by scaling it down by 1/1000. \nDo you have any clues of where in the chain this problem could occur? Does iOS have a specific numeric type for font sizes which has a lower limit? Or is my fontSize rounded to zero somewhere?. I really don't have time right now. I'll get back to you with a repro.\nHere is a simple example of my workaround:\n```\nconst VIRTUAL_TEXT_SCALE = 1000;\nreturn (\n (this.svgGroupRef = ref)}>\n    \n      TEST\n    \n\n);\n```\nThe Group element this.svgGroupRef is scaled via setNativeProps based on pinches and pans..

    "silverspace": "\n. I've created a PR with a fix for this issue:  https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg/pull/86\nThis PR has the following fixes:\n1. Fetching the bitmap from the Fresco image cache instead of a local bitmap, since the current local bitmap is a dangerous reference to a bitmap that should not be accessed outside of onNewResultImpl(). (This dangerous reference may also be causing memory leaks). \n1. Synchronizing calls to drawChildren(), since multiple threads can call it simultaneously and render to the canvas object.\nVerified that this PR fixes my double image rendering and canvas underflow issues with RN-0.30.0 and my patch on top of RNSVG-3.1.1.\n. Thanks for letting me know, I'll take a look tonight. I suspect this is related to bitmap caching behavior in Fresco. \nOne possibility is that there are caching differences between Android 4.x and 5.0:  http://frescolib.org/docs/caching.html\n\"On Android 4.x and lower, the bitmap cache\u2019s data lives in the ashmem heap, not in the Java heap. This means that images don\u2019t force extra runs of the garbage collector, slowing down your app.\"\nAndroid 5.0 has much improved memory management than earlier versions, so it is safer to leave the bitmap cache on the Java heap.\"\nDid you see this blank image behavior on an Android 4.x system? Or after backgrounding the app and re-launching? \n. FYI: this should be fixed under https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg/pull/94\n. Thanks for the feedback! \nI am unfortunately unable to reproduce after killing and restarting the Example app on both 4.4.2 (API 19) and 5.x (API 23) in the simulator. I also verified that the issue exists without my fix, but is fixed with my patch. \n\nIf you have some cycles to debug this, could you please instrument your com.horcrux.svg.RNSVGSvgViewShadowNode#invalidateView method with a few log messages? \nIn particular:\n1.  I suspect the problem is that svgView.getRootView() returns null. I'm just not sure how it got into this situation or how to correct from the situation. (Could this be related to the race condition TODO in RNSVGSvgViewManager?)\n   - One potential workaround would be to call svgView.invalidate() if rootView is null. However, I'm skeptical that this will work since that didn't fix the original issue in my testing. That's why I am calling rootView.invalidate() rather than svgView.invalidate(). \n2.  A smaller possibility is that \"dirtyView\" has the wrong coordinates for the rootView to invalidate. Maybe try changing \"rootView.invalidate(dirtyRect)\" => \"rootView.invalidate()\" to see if it fixes your device? \n. I am not able to reproduce either, so I suspect this was an issue with my environment referencing stale npm packages. I've removed my align=\"none\" attribute, and will re-open if this becomes an issue again. \n. Unfortunately no, I implemented a workaround by rendering my SVG on top of a RN Image.

It is cumbersome to keep track of location both inside svg and outside. hitSlop would make this easier.

To combat this we've had to write a wrapper for svg, that exported exactly the same interface as react-native-svg. Easy stuffs, but still pointless boiler plate code if it just followed the same API's. https://github.com/godaddy/svgs\nIt's a project I wrote to work around this limitation. It uses the same syntax for syntax that react-native-svg uses for web. This allows you to use one module (in this case svgs) for both react and react-native based svgs.. Indeed changing the to an absolute path resolves the issues, but the resulting path here is the outcome of from svgo. The original svg didn't have this issue. I'll toy with svgo and see if I can work around this for now until a fix lands. . @msand Apologies for the delayed response, work & life happened. While it's definitely possible to integrate the work that svgs did in to react-native-svg I don't know if that makes sense here. As @indexzero said that would no longer make this a native library. It's a library that works on all platforms.\nOriginally I started working svgs to create a library that allowed us to components that are completely isomorphic and work on React and React-Native without any requirements on libraries or build chains. E.g react-native-web and webpack aliases. This is so any developer and in our case, any team could leverage this library. This is why I decided to with an index.js and an index.native.js so I could explicitly target various of platforms from a single code base.\nWhile I applaud @necolas for his efforts in react-native-web it was not a design pattern that we wanted to adopt. So we went with svgs instead of calling this react-native-svg-web because it works without react-native-web and the webpack toolchain (it still works fine with react-native-web through webpack aliasing as documented in the svgs README).\nAs for making isomorphic icon libraries, we also did that for GoDaddy using svgs, but instead of using style we supply the color changes directly to the <G> component as fill attribute. So we ended up with:\njs\n<Icon name='magic' color=\"red\" size={10} />. You could have created a PR for it ;-). Because you can probably feature detect react-native-web usage, and fallback to createElement from react if react-native-web is not in the node_modules tree.. @msand Shouldn't support for both would be as easy as adding:\njs\ntry { createElement = require('react-native-web').createElement; }\ncatch (e) {\n  createElement = require('react').createElement;\n}\nSo when people don't have react-native-web installed, it will default to react's createElement. Apologies for the late response, life happened. I've spend some time looking through the PR and related discussions. \nFirst things first, the PR looks solid and I don't see any issues with the way it's currently drafted. It should not provide any incompatibility issues with svgs for those who are currently using it together with WebPack and are already importing .web.js dependencies, as the svgs project only imports the react-native-svg project in the dedicated .native.js file.

I usually use cocoapods-based setup when everything (including react-native) is installed with cocoapods.\nCan you rollback all your changes you made in ios project so far and just run react-native link react-native-svg? It is supposed to be smart enough to chose between static and pod setup and react-native-svg's docs seems a bit outdated\ncc @msand it worth reviewing installation instruction sometime soon. @patrick-samy can you post your Podfile here?

You can find sample here: https://github.com/maxkomarychev/svg-integrate. @patrick-samy yarn run eject after this step react is integrated statically. it doesn't take care of pods. if you need to use it with pods - follow this guide https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps. Facing same problem, @icewind any chance you found a solution for that?. I added support for onLayout in this PR https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/651.

However issue onPress vs onPressIn is still relevant.. Fixed by #650. thanks @sibelius !\nwhere can we expect this to be merged into upstream?. @ShaMan123 afaik it was supported before, you can launch playground project to see how does it work\nupdate\nI didn't test polylines, only polygons \nupdate 2\nI tend to think it is supported, the core problem with G and Use existed due to the fact that those are pseudo nodes which only referring to other ones. Latest available release 6.3.1 of the react-native-svg was released 3 months ago, it does not contain my fixes.\n. @u12206050 what is your expected result? do you want both callbacks to work?\nI loaded your example into my playground (reference in first message) and it works, but you should understand that only one view can handle touches.\nIn your example you have the following structure:\n\nG (1) (onPress)\nG (2)\nRect (3) (onPress)\n\n\nG (4)\nG (5)\nPath (6)\nPath (7)\n\n\n\nNow what happens if you press green area - the Rect will handle the touch and the even till not be propagated further.\nAlso if you press Path (6) or Path (7) the touch will be handled by G (1) since it's closest parent which has a callback.\nupdate G itself does not handle touches since it does not have any shape. It is only handling touches landed into it's children which have shape (e.g. Path, Circle, Rect etc.)\nupdate 2 just to clarify 1st update if a G has a shape inside in it e.g. Circle:\n<G>\n  <Circle />\n</G>\ncallback in G will only work if touch lands into Circle and Circle does not have a callback on it's own. if Circle has it's own callback - the event won't be propagated further up to G.\nalso if touch lands outside Circle but inside a box around Circle - the touch won't be handled.. @u12206050 if you still believe this is an issue - pease feel free to open a separate isuse.\n@ShaMan123 you're right, android had support of touches in G and I did not touch it. Also, please take a look at the playground I referenced - I did experiments with scaling. If you believe there is an issue - please feel free to file an issue with sample of svg that doesn't work, thanks.. @ShaMan123 I did tests with scale={2}. @ShaMan123 you can find the code here https://github.com/maxkomarychev/svgplayground in branch problematic-touches-tests where I loaded code from @u12206050 \nupdated commands\njust get the code\nthen do yarn and then (cd ios; pod install)\nthen run as any other rn project: npm start and react-native run-{ios, android}. updated https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/650#issuecomment-401619514 with a bit better explanation. @u12206050 I'll repeat once again, just to clarify: It's not only triggers on Path, Circle and Rect etc., you can get callback on G but the thing is G on it's own doesn't have touchable area. Basically touchable area of G is a union of all touchalbe areas of it's children. So The callback on G will work, but you must have at least one child with non-zero area inside.\nG will get callback as long as there are elements inside G with non-zero area. If you put Circle inside G the onPress on G will work if you press on Circle.\nAt the same time if both parent (G) and child (Circle) have callbacks - only deepest child will get callback working, and prevent parent one from firing.\n<G onPress={1} >\n  <Circle onPress={2} />\n  <Rect />\n</G>\nconsider the code above, if you press on Circle you will get callback 2 working, if you press on Rect the event will be propagated upward to G and callback 1 will work.\nHope it's clear now.. > Would you be interested in joining as a maintainer?\nI would love to :). thanks!. thanks @sibelius !\nwhere can we expect this to be merged into upstream?. @msand updated PR, ready for review. (also fixed potential crash with Use in fe3e60f, decided to keep it in this pr as well)\n. @msand, I didn't really check value of CTM on android, just translated code from iOS.\nWill only be able to look into it next week.. @msand initial ctm on android is identity matrix indeed, so we don't need to keep neither initial ctm nor invert, just take current ctm and convert rect with it.\nready for review. regarding original issue with prod build: @bayukp what is your react-native?\nI'm building prod app with rn 0.53 just fine.\nAlso there's actually special ImageSourcePropType can be imported from react-native. @ExoMemphiz is it possible to see svg code that you were trying to render?\np.s. thanks for pr!. @ExoMemphiz could you please provide svg snippet with exact values for all parameters you have so we can copy/paste it into playground and test?\nAlso it would be great if you could set up demo project and post a reference here.. onLayout returns screen (against top-left corner of svg component) coordinates of an element.\nalso it only works as a callback because screen coordinates of an element are unknown until it's rendered.\nafaik there's currently no way to get bounding box or measurements of an element within svg space.. hey, are you using most recent version? one was published less than 24 hours ago: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/729#issuecomment-408263530. How would babel plugin help reading svg dynamically from arbitrary http url?. seems to be a duplicate of #592 . it's not very accurate, source can also be a number when image is required\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Image/ImageSourcePropType.js#L82-L88\njs\nconst ImageSourcePropType = PropTypes.oneOfType([\n  ImageURISourcePropType,\n  // Opaque type returned by require('./image.jpg')\n  PropTypes.number,\n  // Multiple sources\n  PropTypes.arrayOf(ImageURISourcePropType),\n]);.

One more thing is to be aware is that initial ctm for the context is not identity matrix.\nI also tried to save that initial CTM and multiply it on the left final ctm.\nsort of: reversetransform = invert(invert(initialTransform) * currentCTM) and variations of that. viewTransform = initialCTM * viewBoxCTM * nodeTransform_1 * ... * nodeTransform_n\nI thought I need invert(viewBoxCTM * nodeTransform_1 * ... * nodeTransform_n)\nI tried reverseTransform = invert(invert(initialCTM) * initialCTM * viewBoxCTM * .... *) == invert(invert(initialCTM) * currentCTM)\nam I missing something in how matrix multiplications work?. That's the point, I couldn't achieve desired behavior with matrix operations. The final code you see was rather a wild guess.. as I said I was trying to distill view coordinates through inversions, however the reverese multiplication of matrices worked, not the inversion. I tried.\nreverse = ^(^initial * ctm) = ^(^initial * initial * vb * elements) = ^(identity * vb * elements) = ^(vb * elements)\nthe code below:\nconst CGAffineTransform ctm = CGContextGetCTM(context);\n    const CGAffineTransform invertIntial = CGAffineTransformInvert(self.svgView.initialTransform);\n    self.clientRect = CGRectApplyAffineTransform(pathBouding, CGAffineTransformInvert(CGAffineTransformConcat(invertIntial, ctm)));\ndoesn't work. ok actually,\nthis:\nconst CGAffineTransform ctm = CGContextGetCTM(context);\n    const CGAffineTransform invertIntial = CGAffineTransformInvert(self.svgView.initialTransform);\n    self.clientRect = CGRectApplyAffineTransform(pathBouding, CGAffineTransformConcat(ctm, invertIntial));\nworks..\nbut its rather\nreverse = ctm * ^initial\nhow can this be right?. oh wow... damn it!\nfrom docs of CGContextConcatCTM:\n\nCTMnew = transform * CTMcontext.\n\nso basically matrices are added on the left!\nctm = element_n * ... * element_1 * vb * initial\nthen reverse = ctm * ^initial = element_n * ... * element_1 * vb * initial * ^initial = element_n * ... * element_1 * vb * identity = element_n * ... * element_1 * vb\nbut there's still no inversion of pure transform\nI'm confused %)\nI'll update PR later, thank you very much for your comments..

Yeah that is definitely a better solution than what I was proposing.\n. @mattvot Did you try wrapping the svg with an Animated.View. I have has some success with that.  example (note it is smooth on device, gif is a bit choppy):\n```\nclass Blarg extends React.Component {\n  constructor (props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scale: new Animated.Value(0)\n    }\n    this.animate = this.animate.bind(this);\n  }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.animate();\n  }\nanimate() {\n    Animated.sequence([\n      Animated.timing(this.state.scale,\n        {\n          toValue:1,\n          duration:2000\n        }),\n      Animated.timing(this.state.scale,\n        {\n          toValue:0,\n          duration:2000\n        })\n    ]).start(this.animate)\n  }\nrender () {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n. That gif is gone I believe but I have better examples that use the same idea. I do not have the source up at the moment but I did make a blog post about it a while back, and could go into more details if you would like.\n\n. I am not entirely sure if you can but I was able to achieve that animation by just using a single path (or rect, circle, etc) per svg. Here is the source for it.\n. Until animations are implemented you can achieve something similar with the react native animated library. example (note it is smoother than it appears):\n```\nclass Blarg extends React.Component {\n  constructor (props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scale: new Animated.Value(0)\n    }\n    this.animate = this.animate.bind(this);\n  }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.animate();\n  }\nanimate() {\n    Animated.sequence([\n      Animated.timing(this.state.scale,\n        {\n          toValue:1,\n          duration:2000\n        }),\n      Animated.timing(this.state.scale,\n        {\n          toValue:0,\n          duration:2000\n        })\n    ]).start(this.animate)\n  }\nrender () {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n.

    "chengyin": "On Android, the Paint environment is different from the UI Controls. The Typeface class supports either system fonts (specified with a string), or font asset file. Therefore custom font won't simply work.\nOn iOS side, the check @lewisbarber pointed out is inefficient because it doesn't include all font name possibilities. \n. Note that my PR only addresses iOS. Android is trickier since you can just specify a custom font name. It has to be a custom font path. I am not sure where to hide that complexity.\n. Further investigation points to Touchable shipped with react-native. Using onPressOut instead of onPress resolved the issue. Although I'm not sure why. I will close this since this is not an issue of this lib.\n. Also getting the same conclusion here.\nThe Bug\nSummary: All move related touch behavior functions incorrectly with react-native-svg.\nI created a demo project to demo this:\nhttps://github.com/chengyin/react-native-svg-press-bug\nHere is a GIF:\n\nYou can see that in this sequence:\n1. Touch down\n2. Move within the Rect\n3. Touch up\nThe expected behavior is onPress event is filed. Unfortunately for react-native-svg, this is not happening. \nTechnical Details\nThis line in RN's Touchable determines whether the touch moved out of the view boundary or not. If the touch moved out of the boundary, onPressOut will be fired immediately. It also leads to that when the touch releases, onPress would not be fired. \nTo perform this calculate, Touchable mixin saves the size and position of the element it is attached to to compare them to the touch event position. The measurement is done through UIManager on the native side using frame (for iOS). But this measurement is wrong for react-native-svg components because they are UIView subclass with zero frames. This wrong measurement makes Touchable treat almost all touch moves as if the they are out of the component touch area.\nThis is particularly bad for 3D Touch enabled devices. When combining a Force Touch device (6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus) with an app that targets 9.0 and below.\nDue to an iOS SDK 9.0 bug, Force change triggers touchesMoved event call back (although the touch actually didn't move), which leads to the touchableHandleResponderMove being called, and cancels out the press itself. Essentially, onPresss on react-native-svg components do not work at all on 6s, 6s Plus, 7, and 7 Plus. When the tap is very fast and light, it would work, but this is an unpractical expectation. This is reproducible in the Simulator with a 3D Touch enabled trackpad.\nSuggestions\nI would like to hear @magicismight's input on this, some options are:\n1. Fix frame on native SVG components. I am afraid that this bug here could lead to other unknown bugs.\n2. Override Touchable's handlers to accommodate this limitation, either by cripple the touch support, or through offsetting the measurements from the native side to make them accurate.\nI'm more than happy to help here with the code.\n. Not that I know of. One workaround, which cripple's touch moved event, but makes onPress work is to disable the move responder:\njs\nonPress: [[your press handler]]\nonResponderMove: function() { return; }\n. If you use the svg in a scroll view, it is very easy to trigger the touch out event if the user starts scrolling from the svg. So be extra careful with it. \n. My first reaction is this is going to be hard. I haven't checked with the\nnewer RN version but AFAIK the detection for touch move out in RN assums\nthe element is rectangular, which doesn't work for you here.\nOn Fri, Dec 2, 2016 at 8:01 AM Daniel Dun\u00e9r notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nAny update on this?\nThe reason I'm using svg is to get non-rectangular buttons, specifically\nin a scroll view.\n[image: left-right-buttons]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/148074/20839812/42e8865e-b8ae-11e6-839d-07b5b91c91af.png\nOnce one svg element has failed to register an onPress event, then no\nother svg element will register presses until the view is reloaded.\nThe workaround of setting onResponderMove to NOPs on the SVG elements\ndoesn't seem to work, maybe because of how the scroll view works?

Hey @macrozone, I don't really know why touchableHandleResponderMove wasn't called in your particular case. I'm quite sure in my experiment it did.

It should contain all code needed. . #166 is addressing the same issue with a safer approach.\n. @rgoldiez this patch only works for iOS. Custom font is harder with Android since it is always file based, and I don't know a way to register a new font that can be referred with font names.. Please stop at people unless for direct reasons.

I think the main difficulty is because of SVG API, for example (this is taken from w3schools lol):\n<svg height=\"120\" width=\"120\">\n  <defs>\n    <filter id=\"f1\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200%\" height=\"200%\">\n      <feOffset result=\"offOut\" in=\"SourceGraphic\" dx=\"20\" dy=\"20\" />\n      <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"offOut\" mode=\"normal\" />\n    </filter>\n  </defs>\n  <rect width=\"90\" height=\"90\" stroke=\"green\" stroke-width=\"3\"\n  fill=\"yellow\" filter=\"url(#f1)\" />\n</svg>\nWill produce the following:\n\nfeOffset creates a copy of an input image in this case, then to create a shadow effect you need to apply different Blending Mode and Gaussian blur.\n<filter id=\"f2\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200%\" height=\"200%\">\n      <feOffset result=\"offOut\" in=\"SourceGraphic\" dx=\"20\" dy=\"20\" />\n      <feGaussianBlur result=\"blurOut\" in=\"offOut\" stdDeviation=\"10\" />\n      <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"blurOut\" mode=\"normal\" />\n </filter>\nAnd it will produce:\n\nNot only the code for feOffset needs to be written, which will copy an image, but also different blending modes and Gaussian Blur. .

    "glthomas": "@msand, hello Mikael.  I was recently looking to port some functionality from my ionic app to a react-native app.  My obstacle is that I have glow effects on SVG elements and I would need react-native-svg support for the following tags: filter, feGaussianBlur, feMerge, and feMergeNode.  \nIs this something we could work together, on.  I'd love to see this support added as I think many people would benefit from it, myself included.  I'm pretty new to react, so what's your impression of the level of difficulty to add svg filter support?. @msand, I\u2019m doing my best to follow along.  I\u2019ve got a lot of catch up to do, but I am going through the things you are writing here.  I also started looking at the \u201chow to\u201d build a react native bridge.  . @msand, how can I pull this 448e795 commit.  Is it on a special branch that I can't see?  \nAlso, I managed to get a react-native starter project working and was able to link it to this library.  I was able to get the demo code up and running on my device.  Just trying to lay the ground work so that I can start poking at this library some more and gradually begin contributing on the filter work.  \nOne thing I'll need to learn is how to make my react-native application link to an in-develop state of the react-native-svg library.  That way as I'm making changes I can test them right away.. @msand I've cloned your filters branch and committed the interface for the RNSVGFilter.h for ios.  However, I am unable to push up to your forked repo.  What's the preferred process for contributing.  Is it better if I fork your fork and then I submit a pull request at some point down the line when I have a few more files to contribute?\n. @msand I created a Pull Request to your filters branch on your forked repo.  Not sure what you meant by rebasing.  I anticipate multiple pull requests onto your filters branch.  I'm hoping we can use the multiple PR's to serve the purpose of code reviews as this will be very much a learning process especially as it pertains to the Objective-C, which is entirely new to me.  \nI think once we are satisfied that we have solid functionality on your filters branch and it's well tested, we can then PR this up to master.\nDoes this sound like a good plan?. @msand, so I\u2019ve been studying the existing elements as well as your previous comments and trying to determine the next steps beyond adding the interfaces.  My focus initially will be on iOS.  Referring back to your comment from 19 days ago you mentioned \u201cmain work of making the filter element create a rendering pipeline according to the svg compositing model\u201d.   As best as I can tell this means modifying the RNSVGRenerable.m file to include the code needed to handle the filtering (Possibly within the renderTo method and very near the if(self.mask) conditional.  Beyond that I\u2019m a bit lost how to proceed with regards to utilizing the the feMergeNode(s).  Not too worried about learning objective-c.  It\u2019s starting to make sense after staring at it for a while.  . @msand, to do the refactoring you've suggested, do we need to import CoreImage in order to start using CIImage.\n#import <CoreImage/CoreImage.h>\nIf so what file should we be importing this too?  RNSVGRenderable.m?\nYou mentioned also the need to refactor the mask code to use CIImage to make things efficient.  How do you mean?  Is the processing diverted to the GPU by using CIImage as opposed to CPU processing?\nAnd for the record, I'm feeling really out of my league with this.  I'm starting to wonder if I can contribute in a more supplemental manner.  Perhaps building some tests, working on the documentation.  Etc.  I'm not trying to back out here, I'm just trying to be pragmatic.  I've got a limited amount of time I can contribute to this and I'm beginning to sense that it's going to take a lot of time and energy to get up to speed on this.  You seem to have a really solid understanding of what is happening with not only SVG but, the CoreGraphics and Image libraries.  It might take me 6 months to get up to where I need to be to have a solid enough understanding of what is happening with the pipeline to contribute in a way that doesn't require as much hand holding.  Please advise.\n. @msand do we need to add the Core Image Framework to the project and import it?. @msand Would it be helpful if I started in on updating the readme to include a section for the filters, while you continue to hammer away at the pipeline and filter graph?  Also I could add some examples for the Mask and Filter.  It seems that the examples for this project are maintained in a tree branch under @magicismight.  Thoughts?. @msand, incredible work here.  Not sure how you find the time.  At any rate I tried adding the mask example you provided here to the Examples submodule maintained by @magicismight \nI have a PR open over on there.  Though we still need to add an icon for the example.\n. I'm going to close this PR, on the grounds that I opened it and the work that @msand has done on the filters branch since this was opened has progressed far beyond the code contained in this branch.. @oleksandr-dziuban please see issue #150 for greater context on the current state of the filter-support work..

    "dustinsavery": "@msand I do not have access. It looks as though @magicismight is the only contributor, meaning he's probably the only one that has access. Another person that might have any insight on how to proceed here is @brentvatne. Any thoughts?. @MaxGraey This has been sitting for quite awhile, are you planning to finish this?. @maxgraey Totally understand. For now, I\u2019ll close this PR. Feel free to open a new one if you have time to update it :) . I haven\u2019t had time to investigate this one. Do you have any additional details like platform? Also, if you happen to have the images and could drop them somewhere public so I could test, that would help. . @msageryd that helps a ton, thanks for providing all those details!. If others are still having issues with this, please post your versions of react-native-svg, react-native, and android to help narrow down the problem. . @logvi thanks for posting, I'll take a look. I haven't had any success locating the source of the problem. I am no android expert though. Hopefully someone with more android experience can help here.. This does not appear to be needed. Closing this PR.. Pretty sure this is a fluke that it works in iOS. Putting a View inside an SVG component is not supported: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#supported-elements. I have not seen this before. I will take a look. Confirmed, using the latest react-native doesn't require this fix. Closing this PR, will re-open if needed.. Closing this issue, fix was in #435 . @soulwu Is this still needed?. Closing this PR for now since it appears to be inactive. Feel free to re-open if you want to work on it more. There's no need to manually drag over the project. All you need to do is run react-native link react-native-svg and the library will be accessible in your project. Once it's there, be sure the library is referenced in the Linked Frameworks and Libraries (only the libRNSVG.a, not the libRNSVG-tvos.a). I've added this to the README here: #547 . This is causing another issue too. Going to try and lower the appcompat setting and see if it fixes this.. Weird, I'm seeing the issue, but at 5461px width (fine) and 5462px (missing). I don't believe this library uses ART.. @wbattel4607 any additional information you can provide with regards to your \"fiddling\" would be helpful. I have seen the reports on this, but it doesn't appear to happen consistently.. hmm. so it sounds like the fix was to downgrade. I've used 6.0.0 on a clean project (which was using 0.50.2 and it seemed to work for me using the example code. Not sure what I did differently though. I'll try again on a new project and see if I have issues.. @akantsevoi Have you added the path to your Header Search Paths in Xcode? This would solve it without the need to change it to a framework import.. You need to make sure that all paths that have header files you're trying to use are listed. When Xcode compiles, it looks in all the paths specified, as well as the default library paths, and attempts to resolve all references made. So be sure that you have all RNSVG and Folly header paths listed in your Header Search Paths and it should compile just fine.. Depends, are you also using Folly like the OP? If so, you'd need that in there as well.. @dantman I've gone ahead and merged all but 4 of the open PRs now. . Was waiting for @magicismight, but I\u2019m just going to launch the beta later today. Stay tuned. . Why not add this to https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped?. @aeirola wasn't aware of their recommendation. Thanks for letting me know \ud83d\udc4f . Makes sense to me. I'm on board. @msand if you can resolve the conflict, let's get this merged in before we create 6.0.1-rc.1. Adding the path to Header Search Paths would solve this without the need to change it to a framework import.. It should be. Have you run into issues?. Sorry, I misunderstood. This library is specifically for creating SVG components, not loading in from external sources. On projects I've worked on with extensive SVG files, I run them through a build script I created to convert them into react components that use the types from this library.. @sejr Possibly, I'll have to see if I can piece together the parts that do it. It's currently in an automated system. @jerzxu #512 has been merged. Not super familiar with android, going to leave it open for comments for 48 hours and then merge.  @brentvatne, would appreciate another set of eyes here. . I use it with cocoa pods and swift with no issues. Can you be more specific about the issues? You are still allowed to call retain and release with ARC, they just aren\u2019t required. But there are times when you don\u2019t want the reference to be destroyed. . As noted in #526, it appears it is not isolated to iOS, Android is having a similar issue. The common item across all of these occurrences so far is react-native-navigation. Can you all post the versions you're using? I want to try and narrow down the search.. So it appears the common point is react-native-navigation@1.1.x so far. This is fixed by #521. Closing this issue. @AlgoTrader I think #507 will solve this issue, yeah? If not, can you explain there how we can improve it?. Ok, are you good if we close this once that\u2019s merged?. Ok, since #507 was merged, I'm going to close this PR. Feel free to open if there's something else.. There are a few of us, yes. If you'd like to help, see this post: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/486#issuecomment-342358990. @algotrader Apologies, we\u2019re trying to get more help. This is a community repo, so we depend on community help.. @AlgoTrader That would be much appreciated! Please see this post . Ok, went through outstanding PRs and got quite a few of them merged. @dantman Going to close this now that we have some traction going forward :). @Tennen Not sure I understand, why would it jump from a length of 3 => 5? If you added the alpha, that'd only be 4, yeah?. #512 has been merged, closing this PR.. Apologies, I'm not understanding your issue.. This looks possibly related to #516. Can you confirm if there are any similarities with your setup?. I see you're on Android. What I think is happening is platform agnostic. I'm going to tag this issue in there and close this one as a dupe. Something tells me react-native-navigation is causing some sort of issue. Thanks for adding your findings!. ok, good to know, that would appear to be unrelated to the other issue. Thanks for updating.. Totally agree, just waiting on a response from @magicismight re: release process before continuing (I've never done a release for this repo yet). Once I have that information, I'll be more on top of rolling out releases.\nI'll probably do a beta release first, just to make sure we're stable, before rolling it out to the masses. Sound good?. @dantman New pre-release is out! https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/releases/tag/6.0.1-rc.0\nI'll keep this open for a week and if there are no reported issues, we'll push it fully live.. @nover no, that is not intended. Can you give a bit more information? I have not seen this issue.. @nover keep us posted, in case others have similar issues. . Have you attempted to render the path without being animated?. I tried rendering a plain SVG line with a strokeDashArray, it works just fine.\n<Line  x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"100\" stroke=\"red\" strokeWidth=\"2\" strokeDasharray=\"0, 10\"/>. I'll try to look into this over the weekend and see if I can find a root cause. If any of you know what's causing this and can submit a PR, we can get an RC1 going quick. react-native-svg@6.0.1-rc.1 has been released and it fixes this issue.. @thibault12 the same issues on a cleaned project? If that\u2019s the case, i\u2019ll re-open. @iremlopsum haven't seen that before. Does this happen with 6.0.0?. I just fired up a test project and tried the stroke width on a path: <Path d=\"M 40 60 A 10 10 0 0 0 60 60\" stroke=\"black\" strokeWidth=\"5\" />. This is using react-native@0.50.4 and react-native-svg@6.0.1-rc.0 Works just fine. Can you post your code or more details?. @hpieters that helps, I was testing on iOS. I\u2019ll try my test project on android and see. . Need a bit more context. Are you trying to render the above as an external SVG file or are you trying to paste that into a react component?. What version of react-native-svg are you using? I believe some of those transform issues were corrected in 6.0.1-rc.0. Also, is there any way that I can see more of the code? Not really enough to get a clear picture of what's going on with the above. . @ulisinn Not much to go on, but here are a few thoughts:\n- Not sure why the last image is 70% for both width and height. Since that's the tinted valve, that might explain why it's pixelated and blown out (I'm assuming that's a raster image?)\n- Not sure why everything is in groups, there's not really a need. Groups are so you can control lots of SVG items, here you have no need to do that. Not really hurting, just one less layer of complexity.\n- I would take your layers and go back to rudimentary background colors/some other way of uniquely identifying their boundaries. That way, you can see exactly where everything exists and what manipulating the different values gives you. That's what I would be doing in your shoes as a first step. Once you've done that, you should have a better idea of exactly where the problem lies. Once you try that, snap a screen shot and post it if you would. The next step would be to get the source files from you so I can play with it.. No news yet. With rc.1 had a fix for transforms, but not sure if that would solve this or not. @ulisinn have you tried upgrading? If it still doesn\u2019t fix it, I\u2019ll have to dig down into the lower levels. I\u2019m not as familiar with that portion of the code yet, so it\u2019ll take some time. . @jukben this is solved with #507. This is currently in react-native-svg@6.0.1-rc.1. . Hmm, not sure why it would do that. Is there any chance you can upgrade to the latest react-native-svg and see if it still happens? there have been a number of fixes added since the version you're on.. It actually allows for both. If a percentage is applied, it uses a relative layout to draw it. If a float is provided, it uses an absolute layout to draw it.. Can you post what you have for that element? I have a feeling I know what the issue is (it's a propType issue).. That\u2019s really bizarre and not at all what I was thinking it was. . So that SVG works on a fresh project with matching dependencies? If that\u2019s the case, it could be pointing at the wrong place. . Well it would need a fill right? If there\u2019s no fill, it returns to black. If you created a filled and I filled style definitions, that would allow you to toggle between them. Does that work for your use?\nI use sketch for svg export, it can occasionally have issues, but the above is perfectly valid. . @xhteng Good to know and glad it worked! Could you post the xfinity output so we can compare? I\u2019m curious what caused it. . Is this on a new project or an existing project?. That would work, but it's surprising that you'd have to resort to that. Using react-native-link should allow you to link in the library without any issue.. @adamski what platform are you seeing this on? Also, what versions of react-native and react-native-svg are you running?. Have you tried updating to react-native-svg 6.0.x? . @kbrandwijk that functionality is not currently implemented. Feel free to submit a PR if you'd like to see it integrated.. I don't believe so, but it's something I've wanted to work on. What sort of problems are you running into locally?. I assume you\u2019re referring to Android. As far as I know, that\u2019s a react-native development \u201cfeature\u201d. Perhaps this might help?. @jd20 did you run react-native link react-native-svg?. Do you have anything more from the stack trace? Is this causing an RSOD? Also, have you tried upgrading to 6.0.x?. I don\u2019t have a huge amount of experience with the react native animation, but have you tried upgrading react-native and react-native-svg?. What version is being installed via cocoa pods? Haven\u2019t seen these errors when installing through npm. That might be the best option for now. I don't know what would be causing that atm.. Looks like that was added recently. Going to lower the appcompat and try it.. @msand you\u2019ve got rights now and I\u2019ve gone ahead and added @maxkomarychev as a contributor. . This is pretty self explanatory for react-native.. The Param is already being cast as a string, this would always be false, yeah?. ",

Is there any other workaround I can attempt?. Just to be clear, I already have this working:\n- drawing the svg polygons\n- correctly registering presses on the individual polygons\n- changing the polygon opacity individually in response to presses\nIt works perfectly fine most of the time. But because of (presumably) this bug, the svg elements completely stop responding sometimes.

This would fix the problem in many cases. . i debugged it a little and i am very confused now:\nIf i touch down and move the finger, onPressOut is called immediatly. But contrary to what @chengyin said, touchableHandleResponderMove is not called then and isTouchWithinActive is not called. That's why you can't even manipulate the hitbox with pressRetentionOffset or hitSlop.\nInstead touchableHandleResponderTerminate is called immediatly. I could not find out yet, why this happens. \nMaybe it happens when the svg is inside a panresponder or so.. @chengyin you are correct. I have overwritten onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture with true, then, touchableHandleResponderTerminate is called imediatly.\nI tried to get around this issue here by playing with different threshold in onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture, but i realized that there are even more bugs in the android version of react-native-svg. If you have a panresponder attached on a view around an svg, you will get odd jumps in movements (dx and dy) and speeds (vx, vy) when you move your finger over the view. If you log the gestureState (second argument) in onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture you will even notice that dx and dy do not start with 0 as they should!\nI am trying to work around this nasty issue for days now, but the more I found out, the more bugs arise \ud83d\udc4e \nEdit: this Issue here might lead to this \"jumping\" behaviour: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/433 . does this also work on expo? I can't get custom fonts to work both on ios and android. I have a similar issue. I have a panresponder on a View which contains an SVG.\nin onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture, dx and dy start with a big value even on the first press. I think this is because mutlipe elements inside the svg report different locations. Also movement speeds (vx, vy) get messed up because of this. I tried to work around it, but without any success.. Maybe its related to https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/433 ? \n. I had this crash as well, altough i have a pan-responder on a parent view of an svg. I have a similar Issue, but i have attached the pan-responder to a View which contains a <SVG>element. onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture and others are called for multiple targets, and the locations  for these targets are different. This leads to jitters when used to move the svg with onPanResponderMove and leads also to a other bugs.\nThis bug makes using panresponder around svg's nearly unusable. same issue here on android with 6.0.0. reverting back to 5.4.x.

I can confirm this.. I've found the issue and creating a PR for it.. The error is somewhat cryptic but it means that components are actually trying to create views in a test. That's not possible (and probably not what you want) when you're using the test-renderer.\n\nYou need to mock all svg elements you want to snapshot-test with something that is a good representation of the element. For instance, just an element with the provided props.\nWhat you probably want to do is create a manual mock for the react-native-svg module.\nYou can do this by creating a __mocks__ directory next to your node_modules directory and create a file called react-native-svg.js. In this file you place the mocked behavior of the svg module, for example:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nfunction createMock(elementName) {\n  return (props) => React.createElement(elementName, props, props.children);\n}\nexport const Svg = createMock('Svg');\nexport default Svg;\nexport const G = createMock('G');\nexport const Text = createMock('Text');\nexport const Line = createMock('Line');\nexport const Rect = createMock('Rect');\nexport const Path = createMock('Path');\nexport const Circle = createMock('Circle');\nexport const Polygon = createMock('Polygon');\nexport const Polyline = createMock('Polyline');\n// ... any other svg components you use\n```\nThis creates renderable elements without any behaviour.\nThen you actually can do:\njsx\nconst tree = renderer.create(\n    <View>\n      <Svg>\n        <Polyline points='0,0 300,200' />\n      </Svg>\n    </View>\n);\nexpect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();\nand get an actual snapshot (which is exactly the test input). But you can then also render components with children that render svg elements, and snapshot how the entire tree looks like (what you probably want).\n. You need to do two things:\n- detect pinch zooms with the gesture responder system (\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html)\n(or find a lib that does this for you)\n- based on pinch movement, calculate new zoom and offset and change the SVG\nscale and origin props\nGood luck!\n-Albert\nOp 5 jul. 2017 20:19 schreef \"Anthony Phillips\" notifications@github.com:\n\nanybody?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/374#issuecomment-313184758,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AA7_v2bzxZM2pHQzZ9WOBbLKAMY0uunWks5sK9OggaJpZM4N9EK7\n.\n.

It looks like it's on the native side (iOS) but I haven't investigated it any further.\n\nHere are the code snippets I used for each:\nusing setState\n```javascript\nexport default class testing extends Component {\nconstructor(props) {\n      super(props)\n      this._origin = { x: 100, y: 100 }\n      this._radius = 50\n      this.state = {\n         arcEndX: Math.sin(0) * this._radius,\n         arcEndY: Math.cos(0) * this._radius - this._radius,\n         largeArcFlag: Math.sin(0) >= 0 ? 0 : 1\n      }\n      this.setArcEndFromRadians = this.setArcEndFromRadians.bind(this)\n   }\nsetArcEndFromRadians(radians) {\n      this.setState({\n         arcEndX: Math.sin(radians) * this._radius,\n         arcEndY: Math.cos(radians) * this._radius - this._radius,\n         largeArcFlag: Math.sin(radians) >= 0 ? 0 : 1\n      })\n   }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n      let radians = 0\n      let timer = setInterval(() => {\n         radians += 0.02\n         this.setArcEndFromRadians(radians)\n      }, 16)\n   }\nrender() {\n      return (\n         \n\nM ${this._origin.x},${this._origin.y} l 0,50 a 50,50 0 ${this.state.largeArcFlag} 0 ${this.state.arcEndX},${this.state.arcEndY} z }/>\n            \n\n      )\n   }\n}\n```\nusing setNativeProps (for better performance, error thrown)\n```javascript\nexport default class testing extends Component {\nconstructor(props) {\n      super(props)\n      this._origin = { x: 100, y: 100 }\n      this._radius = 50\n      this._arc = {\n         arcEndX: Math.sin(0) * this._radius,\n         arcEndY: Math.cos(0) * this._radius - this._radius,\n         largeArcFlag: Math.sin(0) >= 0 ? 0 : 1\n      }\n      this.setArcEndFromRadians = this.setArcEndFromRadians.bind(this)\n   }\nsetArcEndFromRadians(radians) {\n      let arcEndX = Math.sin(radians) * this._radius\n      let arcEndY = Math.cos(radians) * this._radius - this._radius\n      let largeArcFlag = Math.sin(radians) >= 0 ? 0 : 1\n      this._thePath.setNativeProps({\n         d: M ${this._origin.x} ${this._origin.y} l 0 50 a 50,50 0 ${largeArcFlag} 0 ${arcEndX} ${arcEndY} z\n      })\n   }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n      let radians = 0\n      let timer = setInterval(() => {\n         radians += 0.02\n         this.setArcEndFromRadians(radians)\n      }, 16)\n   }\nrender() {\n      return (\n         \n\n this._thePath = ref }\n                  d={ M ${this._origin.x},${this._origin.y} l 0,50 a 50,50 0 ${this._arc.largeArcFlag} 0 ${this._arc.arcEndX},${this._arc.arcEndY} z }/>\n            \n\n      )\n   }\n}\n```\nusing Animated interpolation (simplified to just drawing a line, rather than a circle, error thrown)\n```javascript\nlet AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path)\nexport default class testing extends Component {\nconstructor(props) {\n      super(props)\n      this._origin = { x: 100, y: 100 }\n      this._radians = new Animated.Value(0)\n      this._arcX = this._radians.interpolate({\n         inputRange: [\n            0,\n            100\n         ],\n         outputRange: [\n            M ${this._origin.x},${this._origin.y} l 0,0,\n            M ${this._origin.x},${this._origin.y} l 100,100\n         ]\n      })\n   }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n      Animated.spring(this._radians, {\n         toValue: Math.PI,\n         friction: 5,\n         tension: 135\n      }).start()\n   }\nrender() {\n      return (\n         \n\n\n\n\n      )\n   }\n}\n```. @udfalkso I found that simply using setState as per my first example above was sufficiently performant in the end for my needs. @Lyonsclay solution of animating the wrapping View is good if you can accomplish what you need using that but I couldn't in my case. I found that once I had my solution built in release mode the performance was more acceptable.\nIt would be great to be able to use with Animated though, especially if it could hand over the animation details to the native thread using \"useNative\" https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated.html it seems like this is where animation belongs.. @udfalkso nah, true. Is setState too slow? I managed a pretty smooth radial animation just using that.. @udfalkso good work! I'll take a look at that....

    "udfalkso": "@grubstarstar @leebradley I'm having exactly the same issue.  Did you ever find a workable solution?  Thanks!\nI opened this before finding this thread:\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/326. Thanks @grubstarstar.  I'm already doing the wrapping View trick for opacity changes, but I can't do that for fill color.  . @grubstarstar Yes unfortunately in my case I'm doing this for many paths at the same time (20+) and things grind to a halt.  . @grubstarstar @joshuapinter I managed to get it working with some fairly small changes.  \nCheck out the PR.  I hope it works for you guys too: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/328\nThe only gotcha is that you still have to use this.myAnim.__getAnimatedValue() when sending the value into setNativeProps\nanimate = () => {\n    if (this._path && this.fillColor) {\n      this._path.setNativeProps({\n        fill: this.fillColorInterpolation.__getAnimatedValue(),\n      })\n    }\n    requestAnimationFrame(this.animate.bind(this))\n  }\n. Thanks for your comment.  The for loop is just limiting the values that get changed to the ones returned by extractProps().  \nSo if extractProps() does what you want, then that value will persist.  Anything else is left alone. It looks like extractProps() does support transform matrices.  So I think that any transform you use without setNativeProps should also keep working here, no?   . I see.  \nI'm not sure the goal of setNativeProps is to act as a bypass like this.  I believe it's meant to be used to skip the react rendering flow for efficiency reasons alone.  If that's the case (please correct me if I'm wrong), then you would typically hope to see the same rendering behavior with regular props as well as setNativeProps.  \nThe problem that I was trying to solve for my use case is that initial rendering worked great, but then i could not change the value via setNativeProps (in my case for animating the fill color).  This PR fixes that for me and makes things consistent between the initial render and setNativeProps changes.  \nIt seems that you were working around some logic in this extractProps() function, when maybe the correct fix would be for us to fix that logic or add an explicit bypass for matrices there in addition to my changes?  Can we somehow change extractProps() to accept a matrix in the format you want?  \nI'm not sure how many other people are working with your same expectation however.  It might break many people's code?. ",

I'm stuck on the same \ud83e\udd14. @msand this looks pretty suspect: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/elements/Circle.js#L35, for example.. It might not actually have any affect actually, as createAnimatedComponent does some HOC magic. . Ah so yes, that was part of the problem actually! Just as a proof of concept I had changed the exported view property type of r on RNSVGCircle to NSNumber, and then converted the number value to a string inside the setter of r. But the toString in Circle.js, would've meant a string would've still been passed to the native side for the first render of the circle, thus failing the props validation.\nBut with that, animating the radius works with useNativeDriver!\n\nI had my suspicions before, but I'm pretty sure this is not anything to do with property name collisions before with RCTShadowView, as I had hardcoded the 'viewName' to test this. . It looks like the string property aspect is a bit of a pain point! I'll have a look some of the string properties that support units in the documentation as I'm not too familiar with that myself. Having a separate prop for each unit like so fontSizePx and fontSizeEm would allow us to get around this issue by the looks of it for example, and use numbers for these props. \nHowever it might actually be useful to have a Animated.convertToString native method where you could do something like this animatedValue.convertToString('${value}px'), and you'd pass that to your fontSize prop. I'm not sure if this would be useful for anything else outside of react-native svg? \ud83e\udd14\n. ",

Are the prop types exported? If not I guess a minor would do, could also be safe and do a major.. I guess it'd be nice to add flow typings, I remember seeing a project that can generate flow from typescript bindings which we already have. I agree that ideally we'd have one source of truth for generating these props but that might be a pretty big projet to take on..

Actually I think the first crash is related to changes I made locally to try to fix the 2nd stack trace I linked. I'll update the issue to only include the This dynamic value has been recycled crash. Sorry about that.. @msand Thanks for trying it out, I can't reproduce the issue neither on my end and it seems to happen very rarely. Hopefully we can figure something out from the stacktrace or other people hit this crash too.. @msand Sure, I was about to also ship the PR to test if it fixes the issue but it seems like it does :). Native Animated does not work with layout props so its probably just those ones that use Dynamic.. @msand AFAIK Dynamic was implemented to support props with multiple possible types like for example style.width can be either a number or a string when using percent units. Other than that I don't think it should be used since like you said there is a small perf hit.. @msand I think removing shadow nodes on Android makes sense, iOS already uses views only.. @msand I can post in the release repo to get it included in the next minor release if there is one.\nNice! Is that on npm? I'm planning a release of my app soon so I can test it.. Good news, the fix will make it in the next rn minor https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/48#issuecomment-431416538. @msand I'm seeing a visual issue with the component I sent you earlier (https://gist.github.com/janicduplessis/87a859eda656806bd2dea0db0a8940f1) on iOS 8.0.0, haven't tested android yet.. @msand Thanks!!. @msand Awesome, thanks!

    "boygirl": "@esutton adding an optional containerRef prop for VictoryContainer based on this feedback. Tracking here: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/781. With react-native-svg@6.0.0 rotated text is in the correct position relative to its anchor, but is rotated incorrectly. Rather than the entire string being rotated as expected, rotations seem to be applied to each individual character:\n\nI'm rendering like so:\n<Text {...props} (...transform}>\n  <TSpan {...moreProps}>\n    {content}\n  </TSpan>\n</Text>\nStill impacting https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native/issues/103. @msand Thanks for your help! Unfortunately, that change puts me back in the previous situation, where a translation seems to also be applied. In this case it moves the elements off the screen.\n\nthat is with hardcoded transform=\"rotate(45)\". Is that the correct usage? I've also tried with explicit cx and cy values like transform={rotate(45, ${x}, ${y})}\n. Easier to see what's going on with a 5 degree rotation:\n\n. @msand Yes, I already have a one text/tspan element per label which is positioned using x, y, dx and dy attributes. The props provided to the text and tspan elements are identical to those I am using to position labels in web version of the charting library I'm working on. Unfortunately, in the native version, adding a rotation to the text is also causing an unwanted translation. The situation is as described in the original issue, I was just under the impression that it was fixed in v6.0.0. . @msand I notice that none of your examples have a rotation and an x and y greater than zero. I think that may be the failure case.. @msand here's a reproduction in a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/onm20qp2/. This might help demonstrate what I think it going wrong... For polar charts I'm translating everything to the origin of the chart. You can see how all the label rotations end up being rotations around that center point, even when I explicitly provide cx and cy to my rotations. Here are 0, 45, and 90 degree rotations applied to each individual label, not the group\nzero degrees\n\n45 degrees\n\n90 degrees\n\n. Phew, okay thanks! I thought I was going nuts. I'll use an explicit matrix transform for now. Thanks!. @msand Thanks again for your help. This difference between rnsvg and the web svg spec really should be documented, IMO. . @msand yes, I'll try right now. Thank you so much!. @msand Yes, the new parser works correctly for me with rotations in the form rotate(angle, x, y) \ud83c\udf89 . I would love eyes on this as it is preventing many users of victory-native from being able to update to the latest version of Expo.. @msand thank you so much!. @msand testing this branch in victory-native I see:\nfor \njs\n<Text x={x} y={y} fontSize={30}>\n  {String.fromCodePoint(0x1F63B)}\n</Text>\n\nSame result with:\njs\n<Text x={x} y={y} fontSize={30}>\n  <TSpan>{String.fromCodePoint(0x1F63B)}</TSpan>\n</Text>. @msand It looks like it's working on Android but not iOS.

Per @alanbo - libRNSVG-tvOS.a wasn't even in my project. After the react-native link ran, I didnt' have any changes to my project.pbxproj file. Per @ant-fx - that line was added already for me from react-native link.. @msand No, I haven't tried either of those. Regarding the cocoapods, I don't need that if I do the react-native link way of installing, correct? The readme seems to indicate that the CocoaPods are only used if you install manually.. So, I'm sure that repo works but it's also a RN version behind (it's last commit was 2 months ago). Are you saying I should try to install the CocoaPods and go from there?. This is happening to us as well. Here is a gif of it being reproduced:\n\nAs you can see, I'm trying to tap on a TouchableOpacity far to the left and it's tapping on the TouchableOpacity for the plus button on the far right. If I inspect with the Inspector and click center title, it jumps me to the Path as @prakattuladhar suggested:\n\n\"react-native-svg\": \"^6.0.1-rc.1\",\n\"react-native\": \"0.56.0\",. I've figured out a workaround for the time being. All of our icons inherit a base Icon component and I wrapped the SVG in a View and gave it pointerEvents='none' \njsx\nconst Icon = ({ size = 32, d, fill = 'none', color = '#000', strokeWidth = 2 }) => (\n  <View pointerEvents=\"none\">\n    <Svg height={size} width={size} viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\">\n      <Path d={d} fill={fill} strokeWidth={strokeWidth} stroke={color} strokeLinecap=\"round\" strokeLinejoin=\"round\" />\n    </Svg>\n  </View>\n);. @msand I'll try and put one together next week. I'm in the middle of a feature release. Quickly glancing at your code.. I notice you're using <Rect /> and not <Path />.

I'm running same setup and it builds ok for me. Try what @msand suggested and check if everything is linked correctly. \nMake sure you are using legacy build system in XCode 10 as it is required by rn 0.57.x at the moment, there are plenty of issues about this in rn repo.. I'll jump on this as I get some time \ud83d\udc4d . Closing this as issue comes from @types/react package. @msand I'm not sure, but isn't expo still on v6 of react-native-svg? (double checked this they are using v 6.2.2 as of now)\nAlso\njs\n    let animateWidth = initAnim.interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1],\n      outputRange: ['0', '80'],\n    });\nYou used strings here for output range, which in rn 0.57.x yields error\nNSString can't be converted to Yoga Value\nI think with v7 we can use numbers here? At least I am able to use <Rect width={80} />\n\nI see you also made SVG an animated component, I will try that out, but is there a reason why it needs to be one?. UPDATE: Making Svg animated as well in my example didn't do the trick :/. @msand I didn't, but added it just in case and tested, same result. I added it to code in my question to reflect current state. I think useNativeDriver should be \"undefined\" by default anyway however.\nI also tried animating width of Svg element instead of rect, no luck there either :/ \nI'm not sure if it helps at all, but I added ref to my AnimatedRect its width doesn't seem to be a number or string, rather animated interpolation function, not sure if this is causing issue possibly?\n\n. @msand I tried this with latest master and it is now working, thank you! :)\nFew caveats that I think are worth mentioning, in your example you have useNativeDriver: true, this only works with rectwidth, for width it needs to be disabled or not present.\nI will stick with using rectwidth for animations as they seem to be more performant, is this safe to do?\nWhat I mentioned above, seems like a \"hidden\" knowledge at the moment i.e I would have never figure this out from the docs at the moment and am still not sure of difference between width and rectwidth and why one works with native driver and other doesn't? If you explain it and feel like it might deserve space in the documentation, I can help with PR \ud83d\udc4d \nShall this issue be closed or shall I close it after fix is up on npm?. > I would actually expect that we can get rid of the {use,mask,image,bb,pattern,rect}{width,height} attributes and just use width and height instead, as I've been able to override the transform\n\nfb4e877#diff-50f7e7f8735df31a6ac08ae41511a2a6R262\nfb4e877#diff-ba367d8c1ef85007a13efc389f1b0608R156\nview property handlers in the view managers, it should be possible to do the same with them as well.\n\nIf thats achievable, it definitely sounds less confusing and easier to get going with, I wonder how many people will skip setting useNativeDriver to true however since in general rn doesn't support it for width, only transitions and opacity atm I think? If skipped, will it cause any errors?. NOTE: This is a long response but it walks through issue and solution I found for another animation issue.\n@msand seems to be working well with some cases I tested, I tried to use same approach in example below, essentially trying to replicate https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js yellow progress-bar circle from here, but with gradient colour. Approach we used for width does not work here, is this because strokeDasharray accepts array instead of number ?\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Animated, StyleSheet, ViewProperties

Will submit a PR soon.\nmGestureStartTime = TouchEvent.UNSET; should not be set on MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_UP, but rather on MotionEvent.ACTION_UP. Yes. I forgot to post, but I found what the problem was and found a (non-ideal) workaround.\nBasically the issue is #376.\nSVG events don't have correct locationX and locationY - they are fixed, so because of the way I had it set up, I was getting both events from the root SVG, which were wrong and events from the child object, which were correct. \nI hope #376 will be fixed soon, but meanwhile, I just switched to use pageX and pageY instead. \nIt worked in my case, but it's not ideal and it won't work in all cases.. @sabativi, I simply found a way to do what I needed without using locationX and locationY in my event handler. I used pageX and pageY, instead. In my case, I know exactly where on the page the canvas component is located, so could get the canvas location this way.\nI wish they fix the original issue, though (#376).. What is the status of this issue? \nI tried react-native-svg@6.0.1-rc2 and it's still broken for Android only (works perfectly on iOS).\n. In my case, I have stroke only not fill, but it works totally fine on iOS. It's just Android that it doesn't work on. \nThe pan responder works when set on the <SVG> element. But this is not a good solution in my case, because I want to detect touches on its children (which are rectanglular boxes with handles scattered somewhere on the canvas). If I were to use a global handler for the whole <SVG> then I need to basically implement hit testing myself, so that defeats the purpose. \nUnless you mean to do something like this (which I thought won't work, so I never tried)?\n<SVG>\n   <View>\n      <G {...this.panResponder.panHandlers}>\n         //my rectangle with handles etc.\n      </G>\n  </View>\n  ...\n<SVG>\nI debugged a little and I see the event firing, but the _dispatchListeners property of the target of the event is null in setResponderAndExtractTransfer.\nOn iOS it is not null.\nSo the event handlers are for some reason not attached correctly on Android, but I don't understand well enough where this is supposed to happen.. Here is the complete reproduction:\n```import React from 'react'\nimport { GestureResponderEvent, PanResponder, PanResponderInstance, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native'\nimport { Rect, Svg } from 'react-native-svg';\nexport interface DesignSpacecontainerProps {\n    maxDim: number\n}\nexport class DesignSpaceContainer extends React.Component {\nprivate panResponder: PanResponderInstance;\n\ncomponentWillMount() {\n    console.log('WILL MOUNT: design space');\n    this.panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n        onStartShouldSetPanResponder: this.handleStartShouldSetPanResponder,\n        onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: this.handleMoveShouldSetPanResponder,\n        onPanResponderGrant: this.handlePanResponderGrant,\n        onPanResponderMove: this.handlePanResponderMove,\n        onPanResponderRelease: this.handlePanResponderEnd,\n        onPanResponderTerminate: this.handlePanResponderEnd\n    });\n}\n\nrender() {\n    const { maxDim } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n        <View style={styles.root}>\n            <Svg height={maxDim} width={maxDim} style={styles.canvas}>\n                <Rect\n                    fill=\"#ff0000\"\n                    fillOpacity={1}\n                    height={maxDim * 0.5}\n                    strokeOpacity={1}\n                    width={maxDim * 0.5}\n                    x={maxDim * 0.25}\n                    y={maxDim * 0.25}\n                    {...this.panResponder.panHandlers}\n                />\n            </Svg>\n        </View>\n    )\n}\n\n//<handle pan responder>\nprivate handleStartShouldSetPanResponder = (e: GestureResponderEvent) => {\n    console.log('start set pan responder: design space');\n    return true;\n}\nprivate handleMoveShouldSetPanResponder = (e: GestureResponderEvent) => {\n    console.log('move set pan responder: design space');\n    return false;\n}\nprivate handlePanResponderGrant = (e: GestureResponderEvent) => {\n    console.log('grant: design space');\n}\n\nprivate handlePanResponderMove = (e: GestureResponderEvent) => {\n    console.log('move: design space');\n}\n\nprivate handlePanResponderEnd = (e: GestureResponderEvent) => {\n    console.log('end: design space');\n}\n//</handle pan responder>\n\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    root: {\n        flex: 1\n    } as StyleSheet.Style,\n    canvas: {\n        position: 'absolute',\n        left: 0,\n        top: 0\n    } as StyleSheet.Style\n});\n```\nLoad and then touch and drag within the red square:\niOS:\nDesignSpaceContainer.js:28 WILL MOUNT: design space\nDesignSpaceContainer.js:9 start set pan responder: design space\nDesignSpaceContainer.js:17 grant: design space\n7DesignSpaceContainer.js:20 move: design space\nDesignSpaceContainer.js:23 end: design space\nAndroid:\nDesignSpaceContainer.js:28 WILL MOUNT: design space. @msand,\nI discovered something else, which might help fixing this issue.\nMy <DesignSpaceContainer> component (code above) is actually inside another component, which is inside a <Modal>. So it boils down to something like this:\n```\n<Modal \n    visible={isDesignToolVisible}\n    animationType={'slide'}\n    onRequestClose={productPageStore.onDesignToolCancel}\n\n    ...\n<View style={{ height: deviceWidth, width: deviceWidth }} onLayout={this.handleDesignSpaceLayout} >\n    <DesignSpaceContainer\n        absolutePosition={this.state.designSpaceAbsolutePosition}\n        maxDim={deviceWidth}\n    />\n</View>\n    ...\n\n\n```\n\nSo the target element of the synthetic event, which is fired is the <Modal>, not the SVG <Rect> element.\nRemoving the <Modal> wrapper fixes the touch event handling, but I really do need it to be in a modal...\nSo at the end this is a <Modal> incompatibility issue specific to Android.\nI hope this is easily fixable or maybe someone can suggest a workaround.. Same issue: #264. ",
    "RangerMauve": "The best way would be to go to the elements folder and create web versions of each of those components by using React-DOM.\nFor example the G component could look like:\n```javascript\nexport default class extends Shape{\n    static displayName = 'G';\nstatic propTypes = pathProps;\n\nrender() {\n    let {props} = this;\n\n    return <g\n        {...extractProps(props, this)}\n    >\n        {props.children}\n    </g>;\n}\n\n}\n```\nIn this example, I've replaced the RNSVGGroup component with the HTML tag g which is a tag that's supported out of the box.. @ndbroadbent Worst case, you can have this be a separate project (call it react-native-svg, maybe?), and then people can alias \"react-native-svg\": \"react-native-svg-web\" in their projects.

Right now I'm just using SVG to add an outline to some text, so I'll get that working first. I'll post a link to my branch when I'm finished, if anyone wants to take over and finish everything.\nI'm also not sure if a PR would be merged into react-native-svg, since react-native-web is not really official. It's a shame though, because it works so well.. @timscott Hi, no there would be no dependency on react-native-web, the only thing we need to do is create the *.web.js versions and then it will just work. But I was just saying that the web platform is not really officially supported by React Native, so the maintainers of this library might only want to support Android and iOS. But it would be cool if they would agree to merge in web support.. I've just figured out how to vertically center text, in a way that works on both iOS and Android. Apparently the magic number is: 0.25 * fontSize.\n```\nconst fontSize = 64;\nconst width = 200;\nconst height = 200;\n<Text\n  fill=\"white\"\n  fontFamily=\"Helvetica\"\n  fontWeight=\"bold\"\n  fontSize={fontSize}\n  textAnchor=\"middle\"\n  x={width / 2}\n  y={(height / 2) - (fontSize / 2)}\n  height={fontSize}\n  dy={fontSize * -0.25}\n\nhello\n\n```\n\nHere it is with a red fill + blue rect to show fontSize:\nAndroid:\n\niOS:\n\nI have to use both dy and y. If I just do y={(height / 2) - (fontSize / 1.75)}, then it works fine on Android, but looks like this on iOS:\n\nAnyway, was just wondering if there is a nicer way to do this.. ",

Seems like object is retained when you have structure like this:\nxml\n<G>\n  <G>\n  </G>\n</G>\nor\nxml\n<Defs>\n  <G>\n  </G>\n</Defs>\nBasically, if something has a child - you'll get a retained object on iOS.. I found what causing retained objects for situations like:\nxml\n<G>\n  <G>\n  </G>\n</G>\nIt's getSvgView in RNSVGNode.m. It stores reference to the parent, parent has reference to the child, and as a result you get a retain cycle. At minimum it should be changed to:\n```c\n- (RNSVGSvgView )getSvgView\n{\n    __kindof UIView parent = self.superview;\nif ([parent class] == [RNSVGSvgView class]) {\n    return parent;\n} else if ([parent isKindOfClass:[RNSVGNode class]]) {\n    return [(RNSVGNode *)parent getSvgView];\n} else {\n    RCTLogError(@\"RNSVG: %@ should be descendant of a SvgViewShadow.\", NSStringFromClass(self.class));\n}\n\nreturn nil;\n\n}\n```\nBut there is a similar issue with RNSVGUse.

I've had a look through the ios vs android sides for the arc drawing and they look pretty similar - up to the point where they hand off to the native bezier/path code. However, when I looked at what is happening at runtime - there is quite a difference.\nThe first thing that is noticeable is that this generates 5 calls to arcToBezier on the android side, but only 4 on the ios side. The last 3 calls on each platform seem to be very similar and have the same inputs into the arcToBezier function, so I'll assume they should be the same.\nThe second thing is the n value in arcToBezier seems to be the crux of the difference. On the second call in ios vs the 3rd call in android, ios has the n value as 2 and android has it at 3. In digging into what it should be I have this: \nRelevant line of code from java: \nint n = (int) Math.ceil(Math.abs(arc / (Math.PI / 2)));\nCorrect steps (what I can do on paper):\n\nMath.PI / 2 = 1.57 or PI/2\n-PI / (PI/2) = -2 \nMath.abs(-2) = 2 \nint n = (int) Math.ceil(2) = 2\n\nAndroid case (what happens in the code):\n\nMath.PI / 2 = 1.57 or PI/2\n-PI / (PI/2) = -2.0000000556550703\nMath.abs(-2.0000000556550703) = 2.0000000556550703 \nint n = (int) Math.ceil(2.0000000556550703) = 3\n\nIt looks like this is a classic case of floating point math. One solution would be to round the inner result: \n- int n = (int) Math.ceil(Math.abs(arc / (Math.PI / 2)));\n+ double arcOverHalfPi = arc / (Math.PI / 2);\n+ // no round-to-decimal-places function in java so we have to multiply and divide by 10^n to get n decimal places\n+ double roundedArcOverHalfPi = Math.round(arcOverHalfPi * 1000) / 1000D;\n+ int n = (int) Math.ceil(Math.abs(roundedArcOverHalfPi));\nThat fixes the egg shape. The peaks are still too sharp on android compared to iOS though.\n\n. ",

I even started a new project to make sure it wasn't something else.\nRegards,. ah, that's what it is... thanks.. OK, I am where you are (I think) after ejecting and hooking things up to the Android simulator (on ubuntu). I am also matching your version numbers.\nThe good news is that it works. Unfortunately, it is unstable.\nWhen I start the app, no image show up initially, upon refresh, fallback image shows up. But it never changes to the fetched image.\nI then added am SVG text component to show the base uri. \nNow on start, fallback image flashes and then fetched image shows up. This is the correct behavior.\nHowever, if I refresh again, I either get a blank, base image or the correct image intermittently. \nHere is the modestly modified code. I am using an android simulator now. \n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { View } from 'react-native'\nimport RNFetchBlob from 'react-native-fetch-blob'\nimport { Svg, Image, Text } from 'react-native-svg'\nexport default class SVGImage extends React.Component {\nstate = { uri: undefined }\n\nasync componentWillMount() {\n    const { targetURI } = this.props\n\n    try {\n        const res = await RNFetchBlob\n           .config({\n              // add this option that makes response data to be stored as a file,\n              // this performs better\n              fileCache : true,\n              // by adding this option, the temp files will have a file extension\n               appendExt : 'jpg',\n           })\n          .fetch('GET', targetURI)\n\n        this.setState({\n            uri: `file://${res.path()}`,\n        })\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error)\n    }\n}\n\nrender() {\n        const { uri } = this.state\n        return (\n            \n\n\n                    { uri }\n                \n\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\nYou use the above component like so from the main app \n<SVGImage\n                targetURI=\"https://i.imgur.com/nZXbSbh.jpg\"\n            />\nI guess that having to show the <Text> to make it work is a clue, but don't know enough to see what it means.\nShould there be a delay of some sort?\nRegards. hmm, unfortunately, I have the same behavior as before  :cry: \n. Hi @msand, I'm trying to understand https://snack.expo.io/@msand/svg-pinch-to-pan-and-zoom and getting lost in the coordinate systems.\nWe start with the SVG of given height and width (the window in this case).\nAfter that, there is a box defined with 0 0 65 65.\nFor me, all shapes under this are in 0-100 range (I'm using %s).\nThen when someone moves, we call processTouch(x,y) many times with positionX (from position) and positionY (to position).\nThen we take the difference between the new positionY and the very first positionX, and add it to the original Left. I lost you here. Are left and top not x and y?\nWhich coordinate system are touch events (positionX, positionY) happening in? Are they still the same units as the SVG coordinate system? Would changing the box size these things?\nI'm trying to figure out the coordinates of the current SVG portion under zoom/pinch/move area. So for example, it could be a box in range (20%, 140%, 80%, -60%) and (20.0001%, 140.002%, 80%, -60%). I'm going to use that to create some more SVG shapes in that area.\nThanks. I think the top-left corner of this area in original coordinates is (newSvgLeft, newSvgTop) = (left * viewBoxSize / width, top * viewBoxSize * height), where viewBoxSize would be 65 with this definition. What is the right-bottom corner?. still digesting this, playing with the code... \nthanks for your stewardship . Turns out <Image> under <G> does not work. Removing that tag gets me further.\nHowever the image only gets positioned by the style elements, I cannot put it at the desired location within the SVG using x and y.\nHow can I put the image at any location (like I can for Circle, etc)?\n. I apologize. It works. I was using native <Image> instead of the one from this library inadvertently.\nThanks for the awesome package.. Adding to this, if you really want to use Image from svg (my use case because I want to freely position them), use a group  to draw a rectangle along with the image, pass onPress to that.. I'm sorry, I don't know what polylines are.\nFor example, I want the pinch events to be handled by the panresponder (to allow zoom via translate), but allow folks to click on the individual SVG groups underneath (Images in my case).

The \\ has a width of \"100%\" and aspectRatio of 0.72. I was hoping that things would just work off the bat, but now I ran into the same issue as OP and am trying to figure out how to go from here. I've tried re-adding the  component during renders, using a key prop, etc. \nConfused as to where to go from here. \n. HI @msand - \nJust tried out zoomable-svg, worked like a charm. I wanted to say thanks for your ridiculously fast response time and for going above and beyond anything I expected. Thank you so much!!. Is it possible to add some kind of \"safe margin\" so that the user can't scroll the view away from their reach when it's zoomed out?\nAlso, what do you think would be the best way to implement a touch-n-drag override? I want to have a \"draw mode\" where the view box is locked and any taps/drags the user does are sent to my custom handler (to record coordinate paths) rather than being used to pan/zoom the ZoomableSvg.  . Hi again @msand -\nI\u2019ve now got the ZoomableSvg working quite well in my test app, and now I\u2019m focusing on the drawing aspect of things. My question is, how do I convert locationX and locationY coordinates into coordinates I can use on the actual SVG (with a view box of 720x1000)? With regular web dev I could just use getScreenCTM() but unfortunately this method is not available in React Native. I\u2019m not sure what I should do to get the CTM from here and actually apply that to the coordinates I get to accomplish my goal of being able to draw an arbitrary path and zoom/pan around it.. Hi @msand  - once again, thank you for your quick reply, it is much appreciated. I have been testing your 2.0.3 example and it almost works perfectly except for one issue. In my <Svg> component I am using a viewBox of 0 0 720 1000. This results in all the points being offset from where they should be. Removing the viewBox fixes the problem, but I would like to keep the viewBox because it enables me to center my white rect in the middle of the screen:\n```js\nclass WhiteboardSvg extends ZoomableSvg {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);\n    this.props.resetCallback(this.reset);\n  }\nreset() {\n    this.setState({\n      zoom: 0.6,\n      left: 131,\n      top: 131\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\nThis results in the rect being centered in the middle of the screen, which is what I want:\n\nIs there a better way to do this without viewBox? If there isn't, what further transformations do I need to apply to vbX and vbY to make them play well with the viewBox?\nThank you so much!. @msand So i've done that, but here is what I get:\n\nI'd like the rect to be in the center of the screen when the screen first loads.\nHere's my WhiteboardSvg:\n```js\nclass WhiteboardSvg extends ZoomableSvg {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);\n    this.props.resetCallback(this.reset);\n  }\nreset() {\n    this.setState({\n      zoom: 0.6\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd how I use it in render():\njs\n <WhiteboardSvg\n            align=\"xMidYMid\"\n            meetOrSlice=\"meet\"\n            vbWidth={720}\n            vbHeight={1000}\n            width={this.state.width}\n            height={this.state.height}\n            svgRoot={({ transform }) => {\n              this._CTM = transform;\n              return (\n                <Svg\n                  width={this.state.width}\n                  height={this.state.height}\n                  key={this.iterations}\n                >\n                  <G transform={transform}>\n                    <Rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" fill=\"white\" />\n                    <Circle cx={this.state.x} cy={this.state.y} r=\"20\" />\n                    <Circle\n                      cx=\"360\"\n                      cy=\"500\"\n                      r=\"50\"\n                      fill={toggle ? \"red\" : \"blue\"}\n                      onPress={event => {\n                        const { nativeEvent } = event;\n                        const { locationX, locationY } = nativeEvent;\n                        const {\n                          translateX,\n                          translateY,\n                          scaleX,\n                          scaleY\n                        } = transform;\n                        const vbX = (locationX - translateX) / scaleX;\n                        const vbY = (locationY - translateY) / scaleY;\n                        this.setState({\n                          points: [...this.state.points, { x: vbX, y: vbY }]\n                        });\n                      }}\n                    />\n                    {this.state.points.map(point => (\n                      <Circle r=\"1\" cx={point.x} cy={point.y} fill=\"red\" />\n                    ))}\n                  </G>\n                </Svg>\n              );\n            }}\n          />\nWhat can I do to center the rect in the middle of the screen?. @msand So does this mean I should scrap the ScrollView entirely then? Or do I link zoomScale to transform somehow so the end result looks like it should?\n. Gotcha. I just did that and our framerates went back up to acceptable levels. Thank you very much for all of your continued support and feedback \ud83e\udd47 . ",

Have you tried to use Touchables inside the ZoomableSvg?. @msand I've tried it out on some asymmetric shapes, and i think it's great! It runs perfectly on IOS-device but it stutters on the android-emulator and crashes on device. Any idea why? I also think it would be great with some \"safe margins\" as @Nexuist says, like in Scrollview with the maximum and minimum-ZoomScale. \n Your work is much appreciated. . @msand Sorry, nothing wrong with the ZoomableSvg!

AFAICT the problem is that NS_ENUMs aren't prefixed with typedef: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/ModernizationObjC/AdoptingModernObjective-C/AdoptingModernObjective-C.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014150-CH1-SW6. Wrapping require calls in try-catch is prone to errors for client-side software because the dep graph is built statically. It also doesn't work with the JS standard (ESM). For that reason alone I'd lean towards unconditional requires/imports.. API: if react-native-svg were to gain a web implementation, its interface probably should be close to / the same as the iOS and Android implementations (and same for future platforms as well e.g. macOS). This includes being able to accept StyleSheet.create() objects.\nrequires: The CommonJS spec snippet doesn't talk about how modules are made available -- Node behaves differently than Webpack despite both implementing the spec because the spec leaves some things up to the implementation, namely fetching the modules. In Webpack's case, part of the module fetching happens statically during the build and is at odds with dynamic features like try-catch. ESM imports need to be top-level unconditional statements as well for similar reasons.\nFortunately, we can still build conditional dep graphs statically as long as the conditions are statically known. Probably the simplest way to do this today is with conditional extensions like *.web.js and Webpack/Metro/whatever can choose whether or not to include those files in the dep graph. Rewriting imports with Babel is another option but has more moving parts.\n. It seems much simpler to focus on supporting react-native-{ios,android,web}. There's already an excellent solution for React DOM -- it just works with JSX intrinsic elements -- and the audience here is people who are using SVGs with react-native-{android,ios}. The point & scope of this PR, as I understand it, are to give react-native-svg users a uniform API across platforms in the same way that react-native-web and unimodules already do.. swgs: From a technical level, it sounds like the swgs library lets developers use RN or RNW -- this is the pragmatic goal in my mind. The reasons to move RNW support into RNSVG are that people already import RNSVG in their apps and I imagine most people looking for a library called RNSVG are already using RN and are the target audience for RNW. I think merging swgs's functionality into RNSVG addresses this -- the goal is for someone who already has an app that imports react-native-svg and uses RN APIs like StyleSheet to be able to target web without changing their code.\nAt the same time, components that use the svgs library won't pull in RNSVG's web implementation at all and I'd expect this PR to have no effect on svgs -- web projects will use svgs's web implementation instead.\nAPI: I don't have strong opinions on the actual SVG API. I think it is useful to have a unified RN{Android, iOS, Web} API, whatever the API ends up being.\nFuture: Other libraries like all of the Foundation Unimodules are moving in the direction of targeting RN{Android, iOS, Web}. The spectrum of [RN]<===>[RN or RNW]<===>[React DOM or RN or RNW]<===>[any browser framework or RN or RNW] applies to most libraries and requires tooling and guides to work well over the course of several years. One day, if RN has the same API as React DOM (i.e. if RN reduces itself just to the renderer), then perhaps RNW ends up being the same as React DOM and we get to a place where targeting React means you automatically target all the platforms..

If I break on this line I can see that they're set (on self) but obviously not pushed in to the context.\nDoes that seem right to you? It's the first time I've dived in to this library but if that sounds like the correct solution I'll work on a PR.\nUpdate: I've just had a crack at this but I'd need some help on a few things (@magicismight ?):\n1. Why is textAnchor extracted into font but alignmentBaseline left as a 'root' attribute in extractText.js? Is that right?\n2. Where should we be converting strings into enums? It looks like RCTConvert+RNSVG. and RNSVGTextAnchor.m deal with textAnchor (and similarly for most(?) other enum-style attributes) - I guess we should add converters for baselineShift and alignmentBaseline too?\n3. If these attributes shouldn't be extracted into props, I'm not sure how to deal with them in GlyphContext.m - I can't get my head around the tracking of the various arrays and indices in there.\n. @msand wow, I was just about to start work on this thanks to your advice, but it looks like there's no need! Your PR is working nicely for me, using alignmentBaseline on a bezier. I don't have anything set up to test exhaustively but it looks good to me (good idea porting those comments across to iOS too - GlyphContext.m looked a bit impenetrable before!).. It does seem to vary between devices, although I've seen it happen at least once on everything (iPad Pro, iPhone 6 simulator, iPhone SE) except an iPhone 6 still running iOS 10, hence the iOS 11 association.\nI haven't been able to make any headway on it unfortunately, there are no errors or warnings and no way of programmatically detecting the problem I've been able to find. For now I've resorted to rendering a fallback view behind my SVG, which shows through only when the SVG fails.\nAre you also using wix navigation by any chance?. Interesting.

Thx!. does an older version work? I can't get it to work at all when with cocoa pods.. Got it to work, but I also had to remove tvOS . Hi - \nThe above is coming from a react web component.\nThe idea was: compose a trumpet body and the three valves and then animate the valve y position so it gets pushed down in the clipping path. The three valves all have internally a 0/0 origin for image and clipping path and get moved by translating the group. So changing the position of the valve would be as simple as setting y from 0 to e.g. 16. And those coordinates stay the same independent of device rotation.\nBut several things behaved rather unexpectedly:\n\n.            \n\n\nIt almost feels like the coordinate system is upside down:\n- translate to the right with a negative number\n- y=30 actually pulls the image upwards\n- origin is not the upper left of the image (or even center) as I anticipated.\nAbsolute values don't render at all (the original red image is 16 * 20 px)..         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. {\n  \"name\": \"rn_svg_6\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start\",\n    \"test\": \"jest\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"16.0.0\",\n    \"react-native\": \"0.50.4\",\n    \"react-native-svg\": \"^6.0.1-rc.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"babel-jest\": \"21.2.0\",\n    \"babel-preset-react-native\": \"4.0.0\",\n    \"jest\": \"21.2.1\",\n    \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.0\",\n    \"react-test-renderer\": \"16.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"preset\": \"react-native\"\n  }\n}\n.

I've been able to resize it using transform={{scale:'0.5, 0.5'}}, but that seems like a work around.. Thanks EskelCz, great point.  Ideally though, I would prefer to not know the dimensions of the SVG at all.  In short, I don't care if it is 500x500 or 50x50, I just want it to render at 24x24.  Or better yet, render at 100% to fit within the available space of a button container, etc. \nIf this isn't possible, is there some way to get the dimensions of the path programmatically?  Then I could resize the image using the onLayout event, e.g. scale = this.width / 24. I hear you.  So if the viewBox is a \u201cboundary box\u201d, are child components supposed to observe and adhere the boundaries?

The numbers in the vector path are coordinates in a cartesian plane and it seems like the viewBox is just a definition of a boundry box, that lets the svg know how large your shape is. It could be easily calculated from the path numbers (just simple min-max lookup) but they let it up to you to draw the 'boundries' of the data.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/480#issuecomment-358128610, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADrnh0wKykiF-qK-yhiwjc2qRDVbBiPaks5tLSH4gaJpZM4P5Ag-.\n. It makes sense to default to cropping, that\u2019s probably more logical than assuming it should automatically scale (which comes with other baggage... scale to which dimension? stretch to fit?), my preference would be to have the path implement a dimension (other than a percentage-based scale), yet maintain aspect ratio if only one dimension were specified \u2014 like the trusty  html element.  But, if that is not supported at this time I will hard-code scale based on a percentage of the known size of the SVG.\nThanks for the discussion!\nOn Jan 16, 2018, at 17:31, David Spohr notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com> wrote:\n@mnicollshttps://github.com/mnicolls Technically it's okay to be outside but when you change the width and height to differ from viewBox, everything outside it will get cropped.

Looks like a lot of the NumberProp must actually be string issues are because https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/blob/master/lib/percentToFloat.js expects RegExp.match() to [[ToString]] it's arg, which it doesn't (anymore?) - it errors. Probably better to just fix that (in a different PR, I assume) than update the typings to reflect that.\nExtracted a bunch of text/font details from props.js, those are pretty heavily prop-typed and it's nicer to get the errors early. Need to cover those too, so I'll look at beefing up the test app tomorrow, hopefully.. I'd have to double-check, but I recall it being a TypeError. Could be\neither a remote debugger difference or core-js though.\nOn Sat, 27 Jan 2018, 10:00 Mikael Sand, notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@simonbuchan https://github.com/simonbuchan Could you matching problem\nhave been related to this?\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/586/files\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/577#issuecomment-360902808,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABwVo8qJLp07IVH5_J4y1SiBuCNzC8Qzks5tOjzVgaJpZM4RiSEs\n.\n.

Thank you. @msand Hello, do you know when this bug fix can be added to master + new package version published? It's a bit urgent for my project :) Thank you. @msand Hello,I used a link as npm dependency from github to use your latest fix for text alignment/kerning with letter spacing. Just noticed that we have incorrect behaviout for text with textAnchor=\"middle\" after these fixes. Not aligned text is rendered like textAnchor=\"start\", it is shifted to initial position even if we have textAnchor=\"middle\" for it. Thanks. @msand Hello, if I set for any text (single or multiline) just a textAnchor=\"middle\" - I see that text is shifted right. Also TSpans for multiline text are aligned to left side, instead of middle alignment.\n\nv. 9.2.4 is OK for this case, latest versions have this issues. I think the calculation of text tree is a bit incorrect\n. @msand Screenshot with  v.9.2.4\nTop text is single line with textAnchor=\"middle\"\nMain text is multiline with textAnchor=\"middle\" with TSpans\n\nIn all versions after v.9.2.4 top text is shifted a bit, and main text is shifted + TSpans are aligned like textAnchor=\"start\". \n. @msand This code is under NDA, but I will prepare a clean app maybe. It should be just a <Text> with textAnchor=\"middle\" and x, y coords. @msand Hello, sorry for the delay, I prepared minimal reproduction. The problem exists on Android platform, iOS looks fine. So when we use textAnchor='middle' and/or  letterSpacing='<<more than 1>>' on Android whole multiline text is shifted to left side. Issue is visible especially for multiline text with TSpans.\nOn version 9.2.4 everything is OK (before your text position recalculation updates), on latest 9.3.5 issue is present on Android platform.\nI have:\nreact-native: 0.57.7\nreact-native-svg: 9.3.5\nMacOS: 10.14.3\nXcode: 10.1\nTo reproduce it use:\n```js-jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Svg, { Image, G, Text, TSpan }  from 'react-native-svg';\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\nTest multiline\ntext. Test text\n\n\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n``. Hi, when this filter support PR will be merged? It's very urgent :). @msand Thank you for your help, let me check on 9.0.1 too. @msand Checked, but still have crash on my iOS 12 iPhoneX emulator + real iPhone 6 Plus (iOS 12.1.3) device. @msand Maybe the reason in combination of another things.... @msand I didn't check your simple example yet, just tried to run my large application with complex SVG structure and spaces symbols as svg text and still have the crash.\nSo maybe the reason in combination of space symbols and another SVG things in my code.\nI will let you know when I try basic simple app example. Thank you for your time. @msand For me problem replicates in` element only with space symbols.  works fine\nI will check your basic examples in fresh basic app soon. Thank you. @msand Confirmed issue cannot be reproduced now. I'm closing this issues. Thanks a lot. @msand Is this issue already fixed in 9.0.2?. @msand Thank you a lot, just tried to add same Java code for this fix, but I still can't see custom dynamic fonts in the app... weird. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?. @msand Double checked in my app, it works perfectly now with 9.0.3!\nIt was a cache issue maybe. Thank you a lot!. @BabakSamimi You just changed state initialization from class property to constructor based. It is the same. Android app work correctly with my code, just iOS SVG tree doesn't re-render. @BabakSamimi Yeah, this issue is present in a few latest versions. If I try 9.2.4 it's OK.\nI have a production application with very complex SVG tree and a lot of components, so for me it will not work just to wrap parent component. I think something was broken in latest versions and can be fixed quickly. We just need Mr @msand to help us :). ",

    "ctgardner": "\nNot sure how to get the current color of the containing (non-svg) element though, you have any idea?\n\nNot really. Do any of the built-in react-native elements demonstrate this color-inheritance behavior? If so, perhaps we could do the same? eg, style={{ color: \"inherit\" }}. > (Developer) React components are designed with strong isolation in mind: You should be able to drop a component anywhere in your application, trusting that as long as the props are the same, it will look and behave the same way. Text properties that could inherit from outside of the props would break this isolation.\nIt seems supporting currentcolor might violate one of the tenets of react-native. What do you think, @msand?. It's more of a convenience. I could refactor to explicitly pass the fill color via props.\nIn a web browser, a svg which does not have a defined width and height will scale proportionally to fill the smallest dimension of the parent. This behavior in conjunction with currentcolor means the rendering of the SVG can be defined entirely in terms of its parent; there's no need to pass any props into the SVG itself. Without the need for props, the SVG doesn't need to be a React component at all. This was my goal.. > You can have a single G element in the root of your svg content, wrapping all of it, allowing the child elements in the subtree to inherit the colors from that already.\nAn interesting suggestion, I might try this.\n\nI made an example with that + a onLayout pattern to make an Svg component (which takes a width and height property) and fills the available space in its parent: https://snack.expo.io/@msand/demonstrate-onlayout-to-fill-parent-and-inheritance-of-fill-color-props.\n\nSorry, this doesn't seem to work. (Experience Not Found)\nAs an aside, I have a react project and a react-native project which share the same SVGs. Currently, I am duplicating the SVGs as they need to be wrapped as react/react-native components. It would be better if the SVGs were not duplicated and existed as .svg files only. Is this possible? (Using something such as Svg.fromFile(\"./foobar.svg\")). Thanks for the help, @msand. Much appreciated!. ",
    "ewalti": "I'm back on 5.5.1 on my project but wanted to try 6.x to see if it would fix some other issues I was having.

    "DanBeard": ":flushed: no I wish I saw that earlier. That would have really helped. Especially looking at how it's handling the transforms. \nI'm using react-native-web in my projects because I love that it treats 'web' as just another native platform like 'ios', 'android' , or 'windows'.  It lets it sharing between platforms work out-of-the-box for the most part. This is probably a better conversation  to have elsewhere, but it would be nice to move the svgs web functionality into react-native-svg using the *.web.js system that react-native-web uses, and then svgs could reference those files? That way it would work out-of-the-box with react-native-web. . ",

    "necolas": "FWIW, neither this PR nor svgs will work as they don't support the React Native style API on the elements rendered. The exported components would need to use react-native-web's createElement helper, as described in this post http://nicolasgallagher.com/making-svg-icon-libraries-for-react-apps/. Previous issue was closed without resolution https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/155. Why not do that work here? And even align the native API with the web?. What kind of things are missing relative to browsers? . For my needs/interests (multi-platform icon components from SVG) the only thing missing was support for React Native's style prop on Svg. If that's possible and is introduced for native, you'd need react-native-web for the web version (const Svg = () => ReactNativeWeb.createElement('svg', props)). I think full parity with the DOM is less interesting that carving out an effective subset that works across platforms (following React Native's philosophy.)\n. Basically what's used here: http://nicolasgallagher.com/making-svg-icon-libraries-for-react-apps/. Maybe? I didn't see anything in the docs about support for the style prop. There's also a bad Touchable import https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/issues/833#issuecomment-367576040. > Do you have any example which isn't working the same in native as in web?\nFor react-native-svg?. I'm not sure it's a good idea to have onPress on SVGs, unless the touchable functionality is mixed in only when an onPress function is provided (as Text does). There are existing components that can wrap SVGs to provide this functionality (and all the other press-related functionality) without folding it into an SVG component. The main problem with svgs is the API is not compatible with React Native more generally, e.g., style. Yeah @msand is right and linked to my previous explanations / examples. Only createElement is needed. Stylesheet.compose is identical to RN and is useful to avoid array allocations when one of two style values may be falsy. Except that would result in bizarrely inconsistent APIs and might result in errors. I think React DOM projects can just use the built-in React DOM SVG elements, and cross-platform projects can use this cross-platform API. ",

I tried both of them and from what I can tell the android fix is good, but the iOS fix does not correct the behavior in my case.\nI'm using this simple example to test it\n```\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  state = { v: 0 }\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    setInterval(() => { this.setState(state => ({ v: state.v + 1 }))}, 100);\n  }\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n\n{'test'}\n\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\nI applied both of your fixes, for android the text moves as expected but for iOS it's not. From what I can tell it seems like the RNSVGText and/or RNSVGTSpan elements are not invalidated when the xPosition property is changed, and thus never reaches the cache invalidation and is not re-rendered. If I also change the text content to something like {'test' + this.state.v} so that the content is changed the position is updated correctly. It seems to be due to it hitting (void)setContent which triggers invalidate. Is this somehow related to the xPosition property change not propagating to the tspan child? I'm happy to test any variation of the fix if that might help.\nEdit\nThe issue appeared on version 6.3.0 for both iOS and Android. On 6.2.2 it works as expected. For android the issue appeared with commit 149f460 but for iOS it seems to be an artifact of multiple commits, I wasn't able to track it down to the exact one. . @msand great stuff, I felt something like that was missing there but wasn't sure if missed something else that was going on elsewhere.

    "jamesreggio": "@msand, that's not a bad idea (to put it behind a boolean prop). I'll look into it.. @msand, I investigated and it doesn't look like it's possible to affect this with a prop because the shadow view is instantiated before any specific props are available for the given instance. It's also not clearly feasible to control this at the root <Svg> node because the necessary view hierarchy context is not available at the time the shadow node is instantiated.\nI spent some time profiling our app and can't say that Yoga layout ever really registers as a performance cost relative to all of the other native concerns. Yoga is only ever going to layout the SVG shadow nodes once, anyhow, since their layout will never be invalidated after initial mount. We have an SVG illustration with several thousand nodes and haven't had a problem, even on iPhone 6.\nI'm sympathetic to the fear of introducing a regression, but I also think it would be unhealthy to retain code that nobody understands in perpetuity based upon that fear. (It's a shame that there's not more robust testing norms in the RN space, but that's just how things are.) #684 also appears to be asking for this functionality.\nIf you merge this, I'd be happy to watch inbound issues for potential regressions.

I think that should work fine at least.\n@msand Thank you for the answer, Mikael! Yes, I realized the possibility to wrap the whole SVG with the consumer and pass downside data into the Stop element, but in my case, I had to keep render the Stop element in the separate component and to use consumer there.\nI have raised this question before found the solution. I kept the plain structure of the children for LinearGradient, wrapping with custom implementation using context API. https://github.com/kutran-dmitry/react-universal-svg/tree/master/src/SvgComponent/Gradient. In my case I'm using expo that hasn't the current version of your project within it, but comparing that version and current I found the main concepts are equal.\nI think we could close this issue if you are thinking that it is unnecessary to solve.

Same results still, crashes on Android emulator for me with the same messages printed in logcat.. I also need to mention that downgrading to v6.5.2 fixes the crash for me.. Yeah I can try it out to verify the fix later tonight, but if someone wants to test out the fix before that you can use my repo for testing the fix from master (it has a clean install of React Native, react-native-svg and the code to reproduce the issue):\nhttps://github.com/kristerkari/rn-svg-crash. Yeah sorry I forgot to mention the emulator details.\nIt's this one:\nNexus 5X\n1080x1920\nAndroid 8.0 (Google Play)\nAPI level 26\nx86. You should be also able to see the previously mentioned errors with adb logcat when running the app.. Oh and one thing that seems to happen to me: it does not crash right away when I build the app, but does if I restart the app after that.. So I just did more testing for the issue. Ignore my previous comment. That was not the app crashing, but rather the \"Pixer Launcher\", so I got confused that the React Native app would have crashed.\nNow that I tried to run the code again, I could not make the app crash with my https://github.com/kristerkari/rn-svg-crash repo, but the errors/warnings were still printed to adb logcat even with the latest master.. I just tested and the warnings are gone now, thanks!. I reported some React Native svg rendering bugs to svgr's repo, and now I realize that the same bugs (width and height with px, xlink:href) are mentioned in this issue. :)\nFor more info:\nhttps://github.com/smooth-code/svgr/issues/234. Thanks @msand!\nI tested the latest commit from master with my svg example app (https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-example).\nOn Android everything seems to work and the SVG images render also without providing width and height props. \nOn iOS this error gets thrown (if I checkout the commit for 9.03 the error does not get thrown):\n\n. the error on iOS does not get thrown if I omit all the width/height props for the svg images.. > Hmm, I just tried checking out that project, installed react-native-svg 9.0.4, and it seems to work on iOS, is there anything extra I need to change?\nThat's weird. I updated to 9.0.4 and I can see the same error being thrown. No error if I downgrade to 9.0.3.\n\n. I am rebuilding the project, but maybe there is something cached. I'll try building through Xcode to see if it helps.. @msand You we right, for some reason when building from the command line it did not refresh the native code. I did the build with Xcode and the error went away, and now also the command line build is working.. I tried the image with the React Native SVG transformer that I have created, and the image renders correctly for me. I don't think that the bug is is in this library, so probably react-native-svg-uri has a bug.. > Would you be willing to make changes on the native side instead?\nI can if you can help by pointing out which files need the changes on Objective-C/Java side. . I was working on other things on the weekend, so I did not have time to look at the changes yet.\n\nOf course, we could also just merge this first, and make those enhancements in other PRs. Might be that animating the font-weight using the native driver would be quite niche/rare in practise. And, it would probably be quite intensive computationally for any significant number of even medium complexity glyphs\n\nIf that's ok, we could merge and create a new issue with details for doing the changes on the native side.\n\nAlternatively, just adding some logic to round any number between 1-999 to the closest discrete font-weight, (and/or clamp any numbers outside the range), and mapping that to the corresponding enum would be fine for now as well.\n\nSo would that mean that you could pass in fontWeight={420}? I think that if the changes are done on the native side, then it's worth doing them properly by only supporting the correct font weight values.\n. You are absolutely correct. When I wrote my comment I was only thinking about the values that React Native supports, but I completely forgot that the Web has a better support for font-weight.. I started looking at making the changes based on your suggestions. I does not seem that difficult, but there are a couple of things that are a bit unclear to me still:\n1) Did you have some idea also of how to organize the code when adding support for font-weight values 1-1000? For example on Android everything is handled inside the FontWeight enum inside TextProperties.java. Should that only handle normal, bolder, etc. after the changes, and where should the code for validating the value between 1-1000 live? \n2) How do you usually handle testing of the new features? Are there some fixtures where the new SVG features can be tested? Also, what would be a good test file to use to test variable font weights?. Thanks for the explanation and examples. I'll have another look at implementing the font changes, and I'll let you know if it is still unclear how to implement it.. 3cff87f  fixes the problem for both remote images and base64 encoded images..

I do have an Animated.View within it, but even if I remove it, there's still a RCTView being rendered inside it, I don't know why.\nThis is my SVG component, let me know if you can reproduce it:\n```jsx\n    const animations = {\n      // Hides each chart while not currently active\n      opacity: this.getOpacityAnimation(index),\n      transform: [\n        {\n          rotate: this.getRotationAnimation(value, index),\n        },\n      ],\n    };\nreturn (\n  <Animated.View\n    style={[styles.chart, animations]}\n    key={`${value}_${color}`}\n    removeClippedSubviews\n  >\n    <SVG width={TankChartSize} height={TankChartSize} viewBox='0 0 240 240'>\n      <Defs>\n        <Circle id='a' cx='120' cy='120' r='96' />\n        <Mask id='b' x='0' y='0' width='240' height='240' fill='#fff'>\n          <Use href='#a' />\n        </Mask>\n      </Defs>\n      <G fill='none' fillRule='evenodd'>\n        <Use\n          stroke={color}\n          mask='url(#b)'\n          strokeWidth='80'\n          strokeDasharray='301'\n          transform='rotate(-90 120 120)'\n          href='#a'\n        />\n        <Animated.View\n          style={[\n            styles.sunshine,\n            {\n              backgroundColor: color,\n              opacity: this.sunshineAnimation(index),\n            },\n          ]}\n        />\n      </G>\n    </SVG>\n  </Animated.View>\n);\n\n```. That's not the issue. As I said before, even if I remove that Animated.View the crash still happens. I've just tested it again to be sure and I encountered the same behavior.. ",

    "alexlau811": "I have been watching this issue since the very first day. The overflow: hidden solution cannot fix my app because I have a rather complex SVG consists of different callbacks for each inner <G> elements. I have no choice but to find the solution myself tonight.\nIn the past few hours, I constantly compare the hitTest:withEvent: result between iOS 10 and 12. I found that in iOS 12, one of the RNSVGGroup incorrectly returns itself during the hitTest:withEvent: so that the callback in onPressIn is invoked even when the click is out of bound.\nEventually, I found the bug actually is from Apple which is also discovered by the community here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/54026261/cgpathcontainspoint-broken-in-ios-12-is-a-workaround-possible\nThe problem is that after all the checking in the subviews of the RNSVGGroup, it further checks itself with all the path of its subviews combined using CGPathContainsPoint() in RNSVGRenderabl*. At that point, even though all the subviews return nil in hit testing (i.e., the point is out of the bounding box of all path combined inside the group), the combined CGPath will then hit the bug of CGPathContainsPoint() that it would return TRUE and hence some RNSVGGroup incorrectly passed the hit testing.\nI tried to follow the solution in SO (duplicating the move point) but seems no luck.\nThe temporary solution is to comment out the self-checking part in RNSVGGroup.m near line 201 inside hitTest:withEvent::\nobjc\n//    UIView *hitSelf = [super hitTest:transformed withEvent:event];\n//    if (hitSelf) {\n//        return hitSelf;\n//    }\nThis may introduce a performance impact but this temporary solution may fix the touch behaviour of listening to multiple elements inside your SVG. Ultimately, it is better to find the workaround to the bug of CGPathContainsPoint().\nHere is the SVG Example that works perfectly in iOS 11 or before since very early version and I cannot fix it by simply applying overflow: hidden in iOS 12: (p3 and p2 are different callbacks)\njsx\n      <Svg viewBox=\"0 0 840 450\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid\" height=\"315\" width=\"580\">\n        <G

    "Almouro": "Hi @janicduplessis, I'm also seeing a fair amount of crash reports with a similar error since updating to 7.0.2. \nWhich react-native-svg version are you using?\n. Hi guys,\nYesterday got ~1k crashes quite similar for about ~20k users on the app yesterday.\nCrashes we are getting are usually:\n- This dynamic value has been recycled\n- java.lang.ClassCastException: com.facebook.react.bridge.ReadableNativeArray cannot be cast to java.lang.Double\n    at com.facebook.react.bridge.ReadableNativeMap.getDouble(ReadableNativeMap.java:147)\n- and java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=10; index=-1\n    at android.support.v4.util.Pools$SimplePool.release(Pools.java:116)\n    at com.facebook.react.bridge.DynamicFromMap.recycle(DynamicFromMap.java:40)\nThese are new bugs in our last release that included an upgrade (among other things of course) of react-native-svg from 6.5.1 to 7.3.0.\nAll of those bugs seem to touch the SimplePoll recycling and upon investigation I found this PR https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/17842 which makes the SimplePool in DynamicFromMap thread safe.\nInvestigating with Android Studio debugger by setting breakpoints in DynamicFromMap.create in here, I found that this method was called by 2 threads:\n- mqt_native_modules for basic RN components\n- main only for react-native-svg\nI also saw that react-native-svg is using Dynamic since version 7 of the lib  (https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/3879c90bd8273ba8b38713b2f39d2bdfd5265665)\nSo it seems like the issue could be:\n- react-native-svg started using Dynamic\n- but SimplePool in DynamicFromMap is not thread safe\n- and react-native-svg uses a different thread than default RN one\nI can try downgrading react-native-svg or applying the PR above and build the app with the forked React Native version to validate that.\nWhat do you guys think? Where is react-native-svg using a different thread?. @msand https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/commit/3879c90bd8273ba8b38713b2f39d2bdfd5265665 is rolling out for 10% of our users now.\nI'll let you know how it goes :). @msand I confirm that this issue has disappeared \ud83c\udf89 for those 10% including the PR on React Native (facebook/react-native#17842)\nI'll push this PR on React Native side, but might I ask: why is it that other components being animated with the native driver don't trigger this exception while react-native-svg components do?\nOur biggest crash on that newest release is now:\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: \n  at com.horcrux.svg.RenderableViewManager$6.setR (RenderableViewManager.java:237)\nI can open a new issue for it, I don't think it's related\n. @msand I opened a new issue for the new bug. I don't think it has to do with this issue anymore :). @msand unfortunately since I cannot reproduce locally, I'm not very keen on deploying a non stable version of this lib to them to validate the fix.\nI'm downgrading to 6.5.2 for now.\nHopefully we'll find a way to reproduce with the version 7.

    "david-cako": "I was having issues where it wasn't converting NSString to NSFloat and NSNumber. Many hours spent, many combinations of RNSVG and victory-native (what I was using it with), clean builds all along the way, and I even bumped from react-native 0.55.4 to 0.57.3. Nothing worked.\nI started screwing with the order of libraries in my xcode project and that seemed to fix it. One thing I remember doing specifically was putting libPods (as I have RNSVG installed through cocoapods) first in Linked Libraries and Frameworks.\nI'd recommend if anyone is having issues with value conversion that they toy with the order RNSVG is linked, or try using/not using cocoapods for installation. I think there's something going on where another library I'm using is stomping on RNSVG's expected RCTConvert imports/implementation.. ",

dial grid rows - they look like this:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Dimensions, View } from 'react-native';\nimport CircularSlider from './CircularSlider';\nimport Dial, { DialProps } from './Dial';\ninterface Props {\n  dialPropsList: DialProps[];\n}\nconst DialGridRow: React.SFC = (props) => {\n  const listItems = props.dialPropsList.map(\n    (listProps: DialProps, index: number)

To create the dial effect I wanted, I rotated the whole group. A quick test removing that rotation seems to remove the touch-handling issue. Similarly, if I have only one row (the code is written to work fine with anywhere between 1 and 4 rows as there are 4 lots of row props - defined as you might expect using the dial grid's numRows prop), touches work fine, but with 2 or more I see the problem as shown in the .gif.\nHope all this helps. It's a blocker for me at the moment :(\nUPDATE: I tried all 8.x.x releases, my particular problem turned up in 8.0.6. And in fact, I downgraded to 6.5.2 and the problem went away. Unfortunately another problem that originally forced me to upgrade means I can't use that either....so...@msand Any chance of taking a look at this? . Well..yes, it certainly solves the issue of not being able to drag the bar, so thank you. However, touches are still behaving weirdly on account of the rotation I applied to the group above. In the full project that this example comes from, I have a nav button top right that has an icon in the middle. When rotations are applied to my group, that button stops receiving touches on the icon part, but otherwise behaves correctly. If I remove rotations the whole button can be pressed. Similarly, if I add panResponder handling to the whole view of my circular slider and keep the rotation on the group, moving the dial on the left will cause the dial furthest right to move! So adding rotations seems to cause problems with the whole gesture responder system... Will try and put together a full project for you. An alternative for me is to build the graphics without applying rotations. That would probably solve all problems, with your latest commit.. Seeing changes...but there are still issues. I changed the gesture handling to just read up/down motion on each circular slider. Again, it works fine in iOS 11.4 but is pretty messed up on 12.1 still. At the moment, the motion is read correctly, but affects another circular slider than the one being dragged, creating a bit of a whack-a-mole effect overall :) Here is the project that I've culled from my real project, it shows the problem clearly. I really it hope it helps, let me know what else you need. \nhttps://github.com/sinewave440hz/DialTest\nI did as you suggested and tried to debug the Touchables, but to be honest I can't get anything sensible from that at all, it seems to hang on the first selected touchable, which isn't even the one I first selected....

I haven't really looked into this until briefly this morning. While I agree with some of your points about why the react-native uses this approach when others do not, additional motives that could inform why Facebook uses this approach include:\n\nDistributing as a pre-compiled AAR treats the Android code more like an artifact dependency rather than a source dependency.\nUnder the current integration point of react-native-svg, it is possible to change the source code (though certainly not advised) under the node_modules path. When the android source is distributed as an AAR, this is much more difficult to do, for better or worse. I think for the case of react-native this would encourage issues to be raised against the project rather than worked around locally.\n\nDigging into the react-native codebase, they achieve this behavior by configuring their build to compile the Android source, outputting the resultant aar in a folder local to the packaged npm artifact.\n\nAfter starting down this route, I elected to stop. I think for this project, the cost of this change might outweigh the benefit under the existing circumstances.\nI will note, the projects we have using react-native-svg still integrate the source in a manner different than that prescribed by this project's README. Specifically, we add the source as I documented in my first comment:\nandroid {\n    ...\n    sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs += [\"${project.rootDir}/node_modules/react-native-svg/android/src/main/java\"]\n    ...\n}\nThanks for your diligence and for maintaining this project..

By following this alternative method we can have a subproject run a yarn install from within gradle and keep the build entirely gradle based.\nAnyways, thanks for this module and thanks @wokkaflokka for the solution to the gradle issue we were having!.

    "scottmas": "@ksesong Could you elaborate on how that would be accomplished by flattening the transformation? I don't need to animate the transform and am interested in finding a workaround. . That makes sense. Would you mind doing a pseudo code example though to make sure I'm understanding correctly? Googling \"flatten svg transform\" doesn't turn up a whole lot that an SVG novice like me can make sense of. . Also, for what it's worth here's a gist to enable the x and y dimensions to scale independently, leaving the stroke width unaffected: https://gist.github.com/scottmas/1f662871ed60043bb14a9af4a3fcd3b0\nBasically, it's a node script to convert an svg file like so:\n<svg width=\"297\" height=\"239\" viewBox=\"0 0 297 239\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M14.5 119.5C14.5 84.9822 23.9822 57 58.5 57C93.0178 57 121 84.9822 121 119.5C121 154.018 93.0178 182 58.5 182C23.9822 182 14.5 154.018 14.5 119.5Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n</svg>\nInto a parameterized React Component like so:\n```javascript\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Svg,{ Circle, Ellipse, G, Text, TSpan, TextPath, Path, Polygon, Polyline, Line, Rect, Use, Image, Symbol, Defs, LinearGradient, RadialGradient, Stop, ClipPath, Pattern, Mask } from \"react-native-svg\";\nexport function LeftField({xScaleFactor, yScaleFactor}){\n  return (\n    ${xScaleFactor * 297}} height={${yScaleFactor * 239}} viewBox={${0 * xScaleFactor} ${0 * yScaleFactor} ${297 * xScaleFactor} ${239 * yScaleFactor}} fill={none} xmlns={http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}>\n      M${xScaleFactor * 14.5} ${yScaleFactor * 119.5}C${xScaleFactor * 14.5} ${yScaleFactor * 84.9822} ${xScaleFactor * 23.9822} ${yScaleFactor * 57} ${xScaleFactor * 58.5} ${yScaleFactor * 57}C${xScaleFactor * 93.0178} ${yScaleFactor * 57} ${xScaleFactor * 121} ${yScaleFactor * 84.9822} ${xScaleFactor * 121} ${yScaleFactor * 119.5}C${xScaleFactor * 121} ${yScaleFactor * 154.018} ${xScaleFactor * 93.0178} ${yScaleFactor * 182} ${xScaleFactor * 58.5} ${yScaleFactor * 182}C${xScaleFactor * 23.9822} ${yScaleFactor * 182} ${xScaleFactor * 14.5} ${yScaleFactor * 154.018} ${xScaleFactor * 14.5} ${yScaleFactor * 119.5}Z} fill={white}/>\n    \n  )\n}\n```\nIt does this by understanding what numeric values are defined along the x axis and which are defined long the y axis and lets you scale them independently. It may be able to get you those animations you want ksesong.. I don't follow you msand. The point is that we don't want to preserve the aspect ratio. We want to stretch the vector in any direction and still preserve the stroke width. . Yeah, sorry about that. I was just trying to not clutter up the issue with an excessively long code snippet. The original SVG looks like so:\n\nAnd when stretched looks like so:\n\nYou can see in the stretched example how the stroke widths get distorted as it gets stretched along the x axis. vector-effects=\"non-scaling-stroke\" makes it so that we can stretch the svg in one direction without also affecting the stroke widths.\n. What would be involved in supporting vector-effects? Mostly just configuring and exposing functionality in the underlying mobile platform svg libraries?. I'm probably the last person you'd want working on this. But @miles-canfield, you think you could take a stab at this?. I've never hacked on a RN library with native integration. Any tips and tricks msand, in terms of building the project, workflow, etc?. Wowz, you are one quick wizard of code msand. Me and Miles didn't even have the chance to look at it. I got your example working perfectly on ios and Android by just pointing my package.json to the vector-effect git branch and rebuilding. I also tested it on my specific use case and it works great. If you feel good about this branch not causing any regressions or other effects, I'd say it looks good to merge.\nI even checked that that when scaling the svg by setting the top level SVG to  preserveAspectRatio=\"none\" and then changing its height (or width) also respects the vector-effect property. So nice job. . Oh also, we should probably update the typings. I'm not quite sure how I would go about contributing to your existing branch so here's the relevant code...\nexport interface VectorEffectProps {\n  vectorEffect?: 'none' | 'non-scaling-stroke',\n}\nexport interface CommonPathProps extends FillProps, StrokeProps, ClipProps, TransformProps, VectorEffectProps, ResponderProps, TouchableProps, DefinitionProps, CommonMaskProps {}\n. Hmmm, I actually can't detect any real difference in the hit target if non-scaling-stroke is present. No matter what, I can only trigger touches if I go a few pixels inside the SVG -- we're talking like 4 pixels maybe. If that's the current behavior for adding onPress to an SVG element, it seems minor to me. \nIf you're pretty sure there is a difference in behavior with non-scaling-stroke you'd have to describe it better for me to be able to replicate it. . Ahh, okay. I put the onPress handler on the top level SVG originally. But when I put the onPress handler on the actual Line, I get the behavior you're describing. The hit area on the non-scaling-stroke element is as large as it would be if the vector-effect were none. . Closing in favor of https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/pull/944, which is more generalized. . Updated to your implementation. If having a camelCase option is the convention used elsewhere in the project for string enums, makes sense to add these additional ones as well. . ",
    "ksesong": "The path data is updated once you flatten the transformation, so the stroke width does not get impacted by the transformation; instead of having stroke > transform which transforms the stroke, you get transform > stroke (as the transform is integrated into the path data), so the stroke won't get scaled..

I am trying to do so but the x, y, width, and height attributes are being completely ignored. Opacity does work however. \nI had some trouble earlier with resizing my large image but had to tweak the styles on it's containers to get it to work.

    "flsilva": "Thank you for your quick response.\nThat's great, also thanks for the examples, that answers my question. I'll make some time to send a PR to update the docs (README.md). I think I can use your pencil draw (code and screenshot), it's a great example to showcase how color, fill and stroke can be used. Sounds good?\nI'm using TypeScript, so I want to send another PR to update types since I get type errors when I try to run your examples. I can see some things missing, and I could add them locally to test and get your pencil example working without TypeScript errors, but I'm not sure what other props the Svg component accepts, could you help me figure that out, so that we can have a more complete type?\nThis is the current SvgProps in this repo:\nexport interface SvgProps extends ReactNative.ViewProperties {\n  width?: NumberProp,\n  height?: NumberProp,\n  viewBox?: string,\n  preserveAspectRatio?: string,\n}\nAs you can see, aside the props it extends from ReactNative's ViewProps, it just defines those four props. Based on your examples, I can see other non defined props that are also supported, so we could have something like this:\nexport interface SvgProps extends ReactNative.ViewProperties {\n  width?: NumberProp,\n  height?: NumberProp,\n  viewBox?: string,\n  preserveAspectRatio?: string,\n  color?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  fill?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  stroke?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  title?: string,\n}\nBut now I'm curious, does the Svg component support all FillProps? This is what it looks like:\nexport interface FillProps {\n  fill?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  fillOpacity?: NumberProp,\n  fillRule?: FillRule,\n}\nIf so, we could have something like:\nexport interface SvgProps extends FillProps, ReactNative.ViewProperties {\n  width?: NumberProp,\n  height?: NumberProp,\n  viewBox?: string,\n  preserveAspectRatio?: string,\n  color?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  stroke?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  title?: string,\n}\nAnd the same question for stroke: does the Svg element support all StrokeProps? This is what it looks like:\nexport interface StrokeProps {\n  stroke?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  strokeWidth?: NumberProp,\n  strokeOpacity?: NumberProp,\n  strokeDasharray?: ReadonlyArray<NumberProp> | NumberProp,\n  strokeDashoffset?: NumberProp,\n  strokeLinecap?: Linecap,\n  strokeLinejoin?: Linejoin,\n  strokeMiterlimit?: NumberProp,\n}\nIf so, we could have something like:\nexport interface SvgProps extends FillProps, StrokeProps, ReactNative.ViewProperties {\n  width?: NumberProp,\n  height?: NumberProp,\n  viewBox?: string,\n  preserveAspectRatio?: string,\n  color?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  title?: string,\n}\nI'm not very proficient in SVG, so it's possible that the types might be further improved, but I believe those changes would improve the TypeScript experience a lot when working with react-native-svg. I can create a PR after we clarify those points.\nThanks.. Awesome! That clarifies a lot, and should result in the best solution I guess, which is changing SvgProps to extend GProps like this:\nexport interface SvgProps extends GProps, ReactNative.ViewProperties {\n  width?: NumberProp,\n  height?: NumberProp,\n  viewBox?: string,\n  preserveAspectRatio?: string,\n  color?: int32ARGBColor | rgbaArray | string,\n  title?: string,\n}\nI'm gonna send a PR.. Just noticed I forgot to add color and title to SvgProps, gonna push another commit.. Hmm they seem different, you think they can be represented by a same interface? What would the mapping between React Native's \"box-none\" | \"none\" | \"box-only\" | \"auto\" to those SVG spec values look like?. Thanks for the info, I learned something. So it seems they are compatible, but even so, I don't think it's possible to extend ResponderProps's pointerEvents to add extra SVG-only values like:\nexport interface ResponderProps extends ReactNative.GestureResponderHandlers {\n  pointerEvents?: \"box-none\" | \"none\" | \"box-only\" | \"auto\" | \"stroke\" | \"visibleStroke\"\n,\n}\nTypeScript will complain with the same error, i.e. pointerEvents attributes are not identical. At a first thought I can see only three solutions:\n\nChange React Native ViewProps's pointerEvents to consider SVG (probably tricky since RN itself doesn't support SVG).\nChange the name of ResponderProps.pointerEvents to something else. Probably not very nice.\nChange SvgProps so it doesn't extend ReactNative.ViewProps, removing the conflict altogether and letting ResponderProps.pointerEvents free to have all SVG-related options, which prompts me to the following question: does <Svg> supports all ReactNative.ViewProps, or just some of it? If that's just some of it, removing this inheritance could be the solution, adding to SvgProps only what it implements.\n\nAnyway, that seems a deeper problem that could be discussed in another issue I guess, unless you think we can find a quick solution to include in this PR. I think the changes in this PR represent an improvement for TypeScript support, fixing the compile errors I was getting when trying to use those props (color, fill, etc).. Let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do to move this PR forward. I\u2019ve been using it locally on a project I'm working on and everything seems to be working as expected.\nThanks.. Ah sure, makes sense, changing now.. ",
    "Ayiga": "@msand I just woke up this morning, and I came to the conclusion that it must be executing the same code at the same time, as you suggested.  Once to draw the element in the hidden view, and another time to try and render the element as a string.\nIt would also explain the other errors that some people are getting on Android, as I have also been encountering them.\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/489 is caused by the resetProperties call in VirtualView.  But that's just when the issue becomes apparent.  The real reason is due to the iteration in VirtualView.mergeProperties.  Because two things could be running the mergeProperties code at roughly the same time, it causes the mOriginProperties to be populated by more things than are expected by  mLastMergedList.  This can be solved by writing to a temporary ArrayList inside the for loop and assigning to the private member mOriginProperties afterwards.\nUltimately, however, the crux of the issue is storing parts of the render state within the Objects that are representing the Elements themselves.  If the parts of the code that hold the render state could be moved out of those objects, the issue would go away entirely.  However, that would require re-writing much of the render / draw code to accept a passed GlyphContext around, and may be a bit of work.\n. @msand So with fdd8f93 I end up getting an error from react-native upon invoking toDataURL.  It looks like react-native doesn't much appreciate method overloading as the Error states: RNSVGSvgViewManager.toDataURL got 2 arguments, expected 3.\nIf I rename the toDataURL method that allows for the options to something like, toDataURLWithOptions, and then modify the Svg.js file accordingly, I no longer receive that crash.\nIt looks like I can get a single SVG to compute, but if I queue them up back-to-back I end up with a width and height must be > 0 error.\nI should also note, that I did attempt the toDataURL call with the specified width and height, and the resulting image is the correct size, but the contents are still rendered at the scaled resolution, meaning the contents gets cut off on my Pixel 3 XL. (I know this is referencing another issue, but I figured I'd let you know, either way).. @msand there may be concurrency issues.  To be honest I wrote the patch just to get things working and I committed it after the fact, so it doesn't have the changes from the patches you were working on.\nAlso, to be fair my patch still gets the width and height issue occasionally as well, so in an attempt to counteract that issue, I added a small delay before retrieving the data URL.  However, since I'm waiting a static amount of time, there's still no real guarantee that it will resolve the width and `height issues.\nthe GlyphContext.push and GlyphContext.pop appear to be balanced in all places that call them, which is why the issue was confusing to me in the first place.  The ultimate cause of the issue comes down to two different rendering processes being called at once, and the GlyphContext being replaced in the Group element itself.  The patch I wrote avoids this by not storing the GlyphContext on the Group, so it must be passed almost everywhere.  In doing this, there's no way for the GlyphContext on a Group to be replaced, so the push and pop calls seem to remain balanced.  But I do agree, that poping more times than pushing is an error, and perhaps that should be handled appropriately.\nI would imagine that perhaps your original path with the synchronized keyword addition may also solve the problem, but I haven't tested it thoroughly to be absolutely certain.  Since I was already moving forward with the patch I had written and I had a deadline, I didn't have the time to give it it's proper due-diligence yet.  Although it still needs to be modified to fix the method Overloading issue.  Based on your patch, while renaming the overloaded methods to avoid the error, it does appear that the crash due to a different number of push and pops being called is no longer occurring, so that is definitely one way to solve that problem.\nWhen it comes to width and height of the rendered output and the devicePixelRatio of the device, I find this somewhat problematic.  The toDataURL call does.  As an example, consider the SVG output from my example.  (In my debug versions I add a dashed line around certain elements to help me with layout).\nWhen submitting through the non-height and width overrides, I get the following results:\n\n\nAnd then, when using the width and height overrides, I see the following:\n\n\nNow this is due in large part, I suspect, to using the default density supplied by Virtual View and having no way to override it.  It seems, to me, that the width and height should always be multiplied by this density scale, and in order to make the width and height aspects work like this, they would need to be multiplied by the desired density.  Ultimately it means that the target density may need to be another field that is passed in, and it would default to the device's.  On iOS this is much easier as the ImageContext that is created can automatically be given a scale.  Using this information, it may be better, or even necessary, to have the width, height, and density live on the GlyphContext itself (It already stores the width and height).\nPlease let me know if you have any questions,\nThanks,\n~ Ayiga.

Hmm... I have non-SVG elements alongside or above, but not within. I have some fairly minimal components where all I had in them were SVGs, Gs, and a Path.\nI originally thought it was an issue with Animated or TouchableOpacity, but removing them didn't do anything to prevent the crashing from happening, and touching just a curvy line still crashed the app. This is only on iOS, btw.

Correct me if I'm wrong. extractProps does not expect matrices. It expects transform objects. As a result, if I pass a matrix directly, it will modify it to the identity matrix. And ofc, the for loop will let the matrix pass. \nNamely, I think the original design is to pass transform objects and the extractProps will translate it into matrix. With your changes, it cannot do this anymore. . "
