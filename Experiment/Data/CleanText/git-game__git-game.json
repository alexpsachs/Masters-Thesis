Yeah I actually had to redo the whole thing because I didn't notice the file in one of the earlier branches. Diffing the file with the other branch's file worked fine though.\n. Well I'm not writing the solution here but it's one you have to check out at some point (it's the one with the data structure related to maps IIRC)\n. ",

This file does exist in another branch? :D\nWhich one??\n. Haha, found it right before reading your comment.

Thanks, this will prevent finding the solution.\n. Yes, windows doesn't use bash. \nCurrently, I don't think you would be able to run the bash files in the game unless you install Cygwin as suggested here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6413405/3926051\nIf the above suggestion works or doesn't work, please let me know. I'll think about a more universal solution.\n. @samfishman I believe I just fixed that issue.\n@InPermutation i'll add the additional information to the README for windows users.\n. done\n. added OS detection suggested by @issue-reporter  in #12 \nLet me know if you have any other issues, thanks\n. as @riqpe  stated your above code breaks GNU/Linux. However, if the code @riqpe works on OSX i'd be happy to add it.\n. leaving awk '{print $1}' on Linux causes the answer to always be given, unless it is set to \nawk '{print $2}'\n. @issue-reporter \nI think your idea is valid. I just don't which commands would be needed for each version.\n@conroywhitney\ngrep is grabbing more than just the string needed to validate the string. \n. @conroywhitney  Well, you're code given for OSX doesn't work for linux. I assume a solution as stated by @issue-reporter  might be the direction to go\n. I have added some links to help people that are not familiar with git\n. this has been implemented, please visit the end of the game \n. @rhoit Yes, you can skip some things. The game is completed. However, I may have not removed some of the older branches that are not useful anymore.\n. see #18 \n. see #18 \n. thanks!\n. I'll check this out tomorrow\n. thanks\n.

It is completely up to you. You could put the link showing you completed it, maybe a picture of the site that you completed it. It's completely your choice.\n. Yes, you are correct, but for most cases without solving the hints you wouldn't know which branch to go to. Although, there is the possibility of jumping ahead.\n.

If you sent an email it will be sent out later today. \n. unfortunately, I never got around to automating this. So, I do it whenever i remember. If you followed the instructions at the end of the game, you should have received the badge right now. \n. I'll take a look at this\n. ah yes, i'll fix that\n. That's an interesting idea, but I feel that git is fairly simple. Something easier than what it is now would kinda be more like a tutorial, and there is a lot of tutorials online.. I understand, but I think part of the fun of the game is figuring out what you need to do on your own. Often times people are going to present you with a problem, and you have to figure out the solution. \nI agree that a list of training resources would be nice, but it also gives away solutions without effort. For instance a few quick searches lead to:\ngit history\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History\ngit merging\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge\nexamine and roll back commits and other historical events\nhttps://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git\nWhich provide some useful information that help  with levels. \n. I completely understand, but I'm busy right now. I'll definitely consider it in the future though. ",
