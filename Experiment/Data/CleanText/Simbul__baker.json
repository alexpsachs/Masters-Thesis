    "Simbul": "Thanks for pointing this out, we will look into the issue and into your solution :)\n. Eventually, I think that a TOC is something that should go into the HPub format definition.\nAs a quick working solution, I think the div+JS is great: it should be working already, without even requiring changes in the framework.\n. Yup, you can add further commits to a pull request.\nSee this document:\nhttp://help.github.com/pull-requests/#pull_request_discussion\n. I'll have to look into this, but it seems unlikely that the problem is with the extension: InterceptorWindow is a subclass of UIWindow, so it should inherit all its methods (orientation management included).\nWhat exactly is missing for your code to work?\n. Yeah, I was thinking it had to be some initialization problem, but I haven't had time to sort it out yet.\nIf you've got it working, all the better ;)\n. Implemented in commit c2136c50c07ccd44ff70dee05c73819554edec62.\nA minor feature is missing: make the status bar automatically disappear when the page is scrolled vertically with a swipe motion.\nI will close the issue when the feature is added.\n. Completed in commit 013a8d219a295f4fb108a7e705460eb1b1b29a92.\n. Ok, we need to back down on this, as it's not possible to associate the single tap to the statusbar toggle and at the same time keep all the other single-tap actions.\nFrom now on, the statusbar toggle will be associated to a single-finger double-tap in the center area of the screen and will be implemented accordingly.\n. The gesture to open and close the statusbar is now a single-finger double-tap in the center area of the screen.\nMinor code refactoring in InterceptorWindow.\nClosed by b074338637fdffdc4920597ec200020cce66274d.\n. The feature you're mentioning has not been implemented yet, though we are working on it and it shouldn't be long before you can use it ;)\n. Using an HTML document as the manifest sounds a bit confusing to me. I think it would be best to have a clear separation between the content (book) and the meta-content (manifest). It's too easy to think of index.html as just another html page, while it is not.\n. @folletto I'd say everything. Changing the extension is good, but then why shouldn't it be called .html if it's an HTML file?\n@totanus You mean you'd make them part of the book itself? My doubt is on having items with two different behaviors (book vs. manifest) but with the same appearance.\n. @totanus: Indeed, some of the metadata can and will be displayed to the end user. However, being it just some of them, I still think it may be best to separate data and metadata.\nThe metadata I'm thinking about are things like the version, the TOC, the flag specifying whether to allow for iPad rotation and so on.\nI think some testing with an actual (fake) book could help put some of these issues in focus.\n. I'm in favor of not showing pages which are not included in the TOC.\nI think the behavior would appear unpredictable otherwise.\n. As the spec is now almost ready for the first release and this conversation has seen no new posts in a while, I'm closing it.\n. Implementation of the navigation (a.k.a. Index bar) has been completed in commit c8b93d19f5e84be90ad289ba7931f2f3ddc964d0 (with some additional fixes and improvements in later commits).\nSince the suggested feature has been implemented, I'm closing this issue.\n. > 5 . Add: Book \"cover\" viewed as thumbnail on the shelf\nImplemented in a8ae6472bbfa7a2b50467edcdf3eccde4db31b9b\n. > 1 . Add: The book should derive the folders from the path it was initialized from\nStarted implementing in c113173cdec81f00fae1d511b598a248f032b133, with an ID for BakerBook. The ID can then be used as a base path for all the Baker \"internal\" folders.\n. Got to a first working implementation in a8e2d0658d4e836cf44bf24529d2d058e0db4c4b, at least for the screenshots path.\nIt's worth noting that the screenshots folder is not based on the path the book was initialised from, but on a folder based on the book ID.\n. > 1 . Add: The book should derive the folders from the path it was initialized from\nBasic implementation completed in 053c592, for screenshots and book status.\n. > 2 . Add: Write the book status when the book is closed\nCompleted in 53c3a132066d5288aee63e52a98f7216724d7ebf.\n\n3 . Fix: Animation glitch when opening a book from the shelf: show the bar on top open, then close it\n4 . Fix: Check the screenshot glitch\n6 . Add: switch on SHELF if there's only one book, open directly (take out ShelfManager)\n7 . Chore: Cleanup (downloader, sha, \u2026)\n\nDone in various commits, the last of which is 16df9640a26c6b3949f02799e830cc25cb2a0f0b.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Fix: clicking on a link and then changing page via tap caused swipe to stop working. Closed by 738754ab8d571c6d31c0743e442901b9fdb42bba\n. Thanks for pointing this out. Let us know if this solves the issue for you and in case you bump into more of them :)\n. This sounds like a sensible request - especially after trying out your book ;)\n. Added configuration constant PAGE_VERTICAL_BOUNCE: turns off bouncing on vertical scrolls, which is good for books that don't need any vertical scroll anyway.\nClosed by b0c2396fd0b501220ca66afdcb003e1ed1cd00a6.\n. The task is going along nicely. Commit 1da50360e86d3b68118c7db55354b43a2ffaacbc is the first step in the refactoring process: we have moved, renamed and reorganised methods to make initialisation more streamlined.\nThe refactoring process is still underway, so be aware that the code in the refactor-to-reader branch will break some features.\n. Fix: statusbar does not displace scrollview on orientation changes anymore, (though the position adjustment is quite abrupt at the moment). Closed by eb59bca33bfc544b2f5eb19c3e418f1d4686e744.\n. Searching inside the book is one of the features we'd like to include, but for the time being we want to concentrate on other more pressing issues. You could fork the repository and implement it yourself, anyway, if you feel so inclined.\nThe index is something that at the moment is better managed by the authors themselves, with an HTML page inside a book.\nAs for the API, I'm not sure I get what you're referring to. Care to explain? :)\n. I'm closing this, as the discussion was not developed further ;)\n. Hey transmitter,\nany luck with your submission? Did you at least manage to get a more sensible explanation?\nAlso, in case someone else needs the information, the list of books published with Baker can be found here: http://bakerframework.com/books\n. Terrific work Florian! This is really the stuff Baker was built for :)\nWhen you talk of uploading to Github I assume you're referring to bringing some of your modifications to the core of the Baker project. The best way of doing that would be to fork the project and later submit a pull request (both operations are explained in detail in the Github help pages). Failing that, I presume it'd nonetheless possible to include changes from a totally separated repo, it would just be more complicated.\n. We are actively working on this very same feature (though we haven't yet pushed the changes as they are a work in progress). I'll check to see if we can bring in your changes without throwing away the work we've done so far ;)\n. I've just finished reviewing and testing the commits in the pull request: everything works very well.\nThe only problem is, when we decided to include the navigation bar in the Baker codebase, we defined some specifications that are conflicting with this implementation. Mainly, the statusbar should still be present and the navigation bar should appear/disappear along with it and have the same behavior (e.g. disappear when the user interacts with the application in any way).\nIn addition, we specified the index.html file as illustrated above by Folletto and we are implementing the navigation bar as a separate class, to avoid adding any more clutter to RootViewController.\nAll in all, these considerations would make merging this pull request impractical.\nI'm sorry we did not communicate early enough what we had decided about the navigation bar: that would have prevented wasting some very good work.\nWe'll try to release the navigation bar code as soon as possible. If you then decided you wanted to improve on that, you'd be more than welcome :)\n. No one is working on those issues yet, feel free to code away ;)\nMore specifically:\n1. It's not been implemented or discussed yet, but it makes sense. Downloaded books should definitely be able to initialize a new index view.\n2. It would be nice if you could post the steps to reproduce the issue.\nLooking forward to your pull request :)\n. I merged the changes, thanks for the contribution!\n. I've merged the patch from therabidbanana and thus closed the issue.\nPlease let us know if you still get the problem. In that case, it would be good to have a list of detailed steps to reproduce the bug (a book that triggers it consistently, as suggested above, would be great).\n. In addition, we made the background for the UIWebView containing the index bar transparent. So if you don't specify any background color for index.html, you'll be able to see the pages below the elements in the index bar ;)\nSee c2426e4e20724e1f1a451a609bec73a11a5d2999.\n. I enabled the wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki\nCurrently, editing is open to everyone on Github. Let's see where this goes ;)\n. Implemented in 352093f0056090f3be8d6cfe69ebfa4b13e2ed24.\n. Thanks for that insight.\nDo you reckon that \"free subscription\" concepts has got anything to do with In-App Purchase, or is it separate based on your experience?\n. According to the Newsstand FAQs, the longest edge of the Newsstand icon should be\n- at least 90px for iPhone\n- at least 126px for iPad\n  and all high resolution images should double the size.\nThe iOS Human Interface Guidelines, somewhat confusingly, specify that Newsstand cover icons should be at least 512px on the longest edge (double for hi res). This image will then be scaled to the size specified above.\nAll in all, I think we'll fix this when we properly implement cover management.\n. To answer your other question, note that, when Newsstand is enabled, Baker will not display any of the bundled books. In fact, you can delete the books folder from the Xcode project entirely.\n(I have added this to the wiki page as well)\n. Newsstand support with free subscription (and no push notifications) has been completed in c951ecae84e225d685ed3b893eba5a989c1e3203, thus I'm closing this issue :)\n. Manifest should now be properly implemented in master, since commit 8fc8d53f956bec2977c13652606ad1620c039a62.\nPlease test it and let us know if it's working! :)\n. We'll implement this as soon as we implement the Manifest as well.\nIt will of course be possible to specify the image to use as background in the manifest.\n. This will be implemented incrementally:\n1. Get index bar height from index.html\n2. Get height and width from index.html\n. The idea behind the index bar is that we'll usually show a UIWebView as large as the viewport. The UIWebView can contain an HTML page larger than the viewport (in fact, this is what happens in the example book). When the HTML page is larger than the UIWebView, the view will take care of the scrolling.\nThis is the same concept of a browser window: the window itself is never taller than the screen, but it can display taller pages by allowing you to scroll them.\nAs for the other issue, I'm not sure I understand it completely. The implementation we have on the master branch at the moment is working fine, so what difference is there in your application that could make it behave differently?\n. I believe this has been implemented with pull request #325, so I'm closing the issue.\n. Hi there psmedia. Have you managed to solve the issue?\n. Since the discussion is no longer active, I'm closing it. Please reopen if necessary.\n. Brilliant!\nI'll keep the issue open so you can come back and let us know how it went. Good luck with the submission!\n. We still need to check this in detail. However, as a tentative answer I'd say that the index view is indeed loaded when starting up the app. The only problem is, the MEDIA_PLAYBACK_REQUIRES_USER_ACTION flag is not applied to that view (only to the main view) and the default behavior is not to autoplay media.\nIf you are in a hurry and willing to meddle with ObjC code, you could try adding\nwebView.mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction = NO;\nat line 85 in IndexViewController.m in the current master branch.\nAs soon as I have some time on my hands, however, I'll make sure the flag (which is now a configuration in the manifest) is applied to the index view as well.\n. Weird. I'll have to look into the code when I got some spare time.\nDo all the pages have the same title tag?\n. Let us know if you manage to get a working implementation of this. Looks like a good candidate for a tutorial page on the wiki ;)\n. To turn off the 4 tappable edges it should be enough to change line 198 in RootViewController.m to:\nint tappableAreaSize = 0;\n. Nope, this only disables the tappable areas (top, right, bottom, left).\nWith this simple change it will still be possible to swipe to turn the pages. Double-tap to open the index will still work as well.\nAnd of course it will still be possible to implement a link-based navigation.\n. Nice to know things are working for both of you. Closing the issue.\n. Btw, it'd be lovely if you could write a followup post and let everyone know where your inquiries have led you, when you're through ;)\n. Changing the edge the index bar is attached to is something we considered, but which didn't make the cut for release 3.0. It is definitely in the list though.\nChanging the gesture is something we need to consider more carefully, both from a user-experience perspective and from a technical standpoint.\n. Hi @nin9creative,\nthat's an issue we noticed as well, but we haven't had time to address it yet.\nThe UIImage that contains the cover is 135x180px. If you use the same exact size for the png, the result is not that bad. This does not make full use of the retina display though, which is why we want to fix it (doubling the size of the png actually makes it worse).\nIf you manage to code a solution before we come round to it, a pull request would be much appreciated ;)\n. This was discussed and solved in issue #182. Closing for now, please feel free to repoen if the fix doesn't work for you.\n. Sorry @rocketjoe this issue has slipped past us.\nBefore we go back and look into the files, have you managed to solve it in the meantime? :)\n. This is extremely weird: when the -baker-rendering property is not specified, it is set by default to screenshot.\nAre you sure the improvement in performance cannot be attributed to some other change? Have you tried going back to a manifest without an explicit -baker-rendering to see whether the performance issues come back?\nSorry about all the questions, but as you can imagine this kind of issue is very weird and difficult for us to reproduce ;)\n. Hi @psmedia, have you had any luck in your attempts with this issue?\n. Sorry for getting back so late. I assume you've managed to solve the issue on your own by now.\nIn case you haven't: I believe the issue is that you should have a .hpub file, not a folder, on your server.\nSee the Downloadable Books section in the readme.\n. I'm going to close the issue next week unless some new information/discussion pops up ;)\n. Hey @JackWS, did you manage to complete that PHP script? It's totally fine if you decided it was not a priority, just want to make sure it's properly linked in case you managed to complete it ;)\n. I just did some testing. They seem to confirm what one of the answers to the question you linked in your first post said: you shouldn't need any extra code to persist cookies.\nFor my test I included some very simple code in one of the html pages (after including jQuery, because I'm lazy :D):\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n    alert(\"|\" + document.cookie + \"|\");\n    document.cookie = \"ck1=session; expires=; path=/\";\n    document.cookie = \"ck2=persistent; expires=Fri, 3 Aug 2101 20:47:11 UTC; path=/\";\n  });\n</script>\nAs you would expect, the first time you open the page the alert is empty. If you then close the application (even going as far as removing it from the multitasking area) and reopen it, you will see that the cookie with the expire date has been persisted.\nThe other StackOverflow link you posted seems to be concerned with setting cookies using ObjC code, which looks like a different problem to me.\nOther than that, the only issue I could find is this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5837702/nshttpcookiestorage-state-not-saved-on-app-exit-any-definitive-knowledge-docume\nIt would be interesting to know the results of your tests on cookies, if you're willing to share them.\n. Hi @JackWS, any news on this?\n. What do you mean by zipping?\n. It sounds slightly unlikely that screenshots-mode will affect cookies, but let us know what you find out.\n(Just to be clear: screenshot-mode makes the experience of turning pages smoother, but ultimately the HTML page is always loaded and rendered).\n. Any news @JackWS?\n. I'm closing this issue. Feel free to reopen if you have any more info :)\n. Hi @digijake, is the issue still bugging you?\n. Hi @teamstar, have you managed to sort this out in the end?\n. We have got 2 issues here:\n- using the referrer query parameter for Baker makes it impossible to use it for anything else\n- passing a mandatory query parameter to every request messes with some CMS\nThe first issue can be solved with a namespace, i.e. making the query parameter less common. Something like hpub-link-target=browser (or a less verbose equivalent) would fit the bill.\nThe second issue can be solved by not propagating the query parameter. It shouldn't be hard to strip it away from the request URL after we have detected it.\nStripping away the parameter has the nasty side effect of going against the principle of least surprise (\"where the hell has my parameter gone?!\") but I think it's an acceptable trade-off in this case, assuming we document it properly.\n. Here's the updated documentation: Managing links and urls\n. Hi @joshbaltzell, looks like the discussion is quite old now. Have you managed to find out whether anyone on 4.3/5.0 has had problems with your app?\n. Closing this, as we decided not to go through with it in the end.\n. This is most likely going to depend on the webserver configuration.\nI did some testing. What I found out is:\n- subdomain names do not seem to influence download\n- a trailing slash, however, results in a 404 both in the browser and (obviously) in Baker\nA trailing slash in a URL is usually meant to indicate a folder, so it does not make much sense after the path to an HPub file. \nThe behaviour associated with the trailing slash is dependent on the webserver, but I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of them would fail to find the content for an HPub url with a trailing slash.\nAnyway @bobnl, unless you have any other questions or comments, I think we can consider the issue closed, right? :)\n. Hi @nruffilo, I hope the solution in your lates post is the one that finally did it. Would you say that we can consider this issue closed then?\n. I think it would be interesting for everybody to hear more about this solution. Keep us posted! :)\n. I'm sad to hear that, @nin9creative. I've edited the first post in the discussion to warn off people reading this thread for the first time.\nGood luck with Paypal!\n. Sorry for not getting to your issue sooner. Have you managed to find a solution?\nAlternatively, you could send us the code so we can try and replicate the issue.\n. Hi @xiripi, did @zenz's suggestion solve your issue in the end?\n. Hi @nerena88, any progress with that? :)\n. Hey @lithos77, any news on that yet? :)\n. This could be really due many different reasons.\nAs a first step, I can suggest thoroughly cleaning the build: remove the Baker app from the simulator (use the home button to go back to the home screen and remove the app as you would remove any app on the iPad) and clean the Product in Xcode (cmd+shift+K).\n. Hi @wijeweera, did you manage to solve your issue?\n. Yeah, we'll know soon enough anyway ;)\n. To chime in on @zenz's suggestion, if you don't care about left and right tap you can remove the else clause starting on line 1301 entirely.\nYou can go from:\n...\n  [self goDownInPage:@\"1004\" animating:YES];\n} else if (CGRectContainsPoint(leftTapArea, tapPoint) || CGRectContainsPoint(rightTapArea, tapPoint)) {\n  int page = 0;\n  if (CGRectContainsPoint(leftTapArea, tapPoint)) {\n    NSLog(@\"    Tap LEFT >>>\");\n    page = currentPageNumber - 1;\n  } else if (CGRectContainsPoint(rightTapArea, tapPoint)) {\n    NSLog(@\"    Tap RIGHT <<<\");\n    page = currentPageNumber + 1;\n  }\n  [self changePage:page];\n} else if ((touch.tapCount%2) == 0) {\n  ...\nto\n...\n  [self goDownInPage:@\"1004\" animating:YES];\n} else if ((touch.tapCount%2) == 0) {\n  ...\nPlease let us know if this worked, so we can close the issue :)\n. You can try commenting out lines 73 to 77 in InterceptorWindow.m. This should get rid of the code handling the double tap (which explicitly prevents the gesture event from being propagated to the views and ultimately to the html page).\n```\nif (touch.tapCount > 1) {\n  // Touch is not the first of multiple subsequent touches\n  // if (touch.phase == UITouchPhaseEnded && !isScrolling) {\n  //    NSLog(@\"Multi Tap\");\n  //    [self performSelector:@selector(forwardTap:) withObject:touch];\n  // }\n  // shouldCallParent = NO;\n} else ...\n```\nI haven't tested this since I had no time to implement a double tap handler in the html page. Give it a spin and let us know if it works! :)\n. I'm closing the issue, given that there have been no further comments. @michaeland feel free to reopen if you drop by.\n. Thanks for pointing this out.\nI reproduced this bug and it is indeed the case that, whenever the book is started in landscape mode, the index is assigned a zero size. If you set \"orientation\": \"landscape\" the book always starts in landscape mode, thus stumbling into the bug each time.\nWe'll look into it to try and fix the issue.\nIn the meantime, I'm sorry to say I couldn't find a quick fix. As you say, explicitly setting width and height makes the index bar visible but it removes scrolling somehow.\n. I just pushed a fix for the issue. If you try it out, let us know whether it has worked for you!\n. What's the order of the pages in book.json?\n. Hello. Have a look at issue #100 (on Newsstand integration) and #269 (on In App Purchase), they may provide the answer to your question.\n. The subject has already been discussed somewhat extensively in issue #269. Have a look and see if you can find something useful in there ;)\n. I'd have to test this, but I'm pretty sure the video can be viewed in portrait mode even though the Baker app is only landscape, when the user selects fullscreen.\n. Hi @morands any news on this issue?\n. Cool, we'll be waiting :)\n. Glad to hear it's solved. Unfortunately JSON parsing errors are not very clear at the moment, so it's totally understandable to be tripped by them ;)\n. For what it's worth, I think it's a positive tradeoff. A proper DRM implementation would take a considerable effort, be arguably more cumbersome for the user and the result would be breakable anyway - as it has always been the case in the music/movie/game industry.\nTo me, it looks like the really successful initiatives to limit piracy have been the ones concentrating on making the purchase/consumption as easy or easier than the alternative: iTunes, Netflix, Steam and so on.\nOr, if you haven't got the same degree of control they have on the process, you can always concentrate on creating a great product.\nAll in all I think you raised a good point, but I don't believe some sort of DRM would help more than what I've written above ;)\n. Have you had a look at the wiki page explaining how to manage links and urls?\n. Hey @Bobramyl, I've spent some time digging into the book you sent us.\nIt's really hard to tell why the index bar is not able to detect size correctly with all the javascript and CSS involved. I've tried removing various bits and pieces from it without being able to get to a single root cause.\nThat said, there's a very easy fix you can put in place: replace the two meta viewport lines inside index.html with:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=2000; height=200; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no;\" />\nThis will make your bar visible and scrollable (you don't need to specify either -baker-index-width or -baker-index-height in book.json).\nOf course the values for width and height in the meta declaration will have to correspond to the size of your bar.\nLet me know if this fixes the issue for you :)\n. No problem George. I'm glad it's working now.\nI'm closing this issue. If you decide to dig into it and find out something that's worth sharing, you can open another issue so other people can benefit from it :)\n. You can start by having a look at the Wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Managing-links-and-urls (although that's not specifically about the index bar).\nIf you still can't fix it, could you post the code for one of the links that are not working?\n. Generally speaking, I agree with you.\nIn fact, that's where we want to head with that button. It's only a matter of putting out the minimal possible implementation first and enhancing it later.\n. I've had a look at the code and the AdInterstitialAd class.\nTheoretically, it should just be a matter of adding some UIViews among pages, to display the advertisements. This is not so easy in practice, though, as that would screw with the page counter and possibly with screenshot mode.\nAll in all, after a cursory glance at the code, I think it can be done. It's just a matter of catching and managing all the exceptions.\n. I'm not sure I'm understanding your requirements correctly, but it looks like your use case may be better covered by placing some code inside the shouldStartLoadWithRequest method in RootViewController.m.\nThe method is called when a new page is loaded and when links are clicked. In fact, that's where all our link-handling code is.\n. And Laker as well! So we have 2 spots out of 10, not bad ;)\n. Hi @bahmet, I have downloaded the archive right now but I can't seem to unzip it, as it is asking for a password. Any hint? ;)\nUpdate: my bad, you sent that already.\n. Right, I've had a look at the code. Take this with a grain of salt, but I've been able to get the links working by commenting out the event.preventDefault(); line in the touchHandler function in html5-canvas-drawing-app.js (it's line 99 in my copy of the file).\nSo after the edit you should have something like:\n```\n...\nsimulatedEvent.initMouseEvent(type, true, true, window, 1, \n                          first.screenX, first.screenY, \n                          first.clientX, first.clientY, false, \n                          false, false, false, 0/left/, null);\n                      first.target.dispatchEvent(simulatedEvent);\n\n// event.preventDefault();\n}\n...\n```\n(I'm showing a bunch of lines for context).\nCaveats: I have not been able to test this on the device, only on the simulator. Also, it's possible that removing that line will cause issues somewhere else. I couldn't find any, but I did not test it thoroughly.\n. Yup, I confirmed the behaviour you talk about on the actual device (weirdly enough, it was fine on the simulator).\nI think I may have another fix for you: go back to the previous code (e.g. uncomment event.preventDefault();) and then change the code starting at line 104 in html5-canvas-drawing-app.js to:\n```\nfunction prepareCanvas()\n{\n  // Create the canvas (Neccessary for IE because it doesn't know what a canvas element is)\n  var canvasDiv = document.getElementById('canvasDiv');\ncanvasDiv.addEventListener(\"touchstart\", touchHandler, true);\n  canvasDiv.addEventListener(\"touchmove\", touchHandler, true);\n  canvasDiv.addEventListener(\"touchend\", touchHandler, true);\n  canvasDiv.addEventListener(\"touchcancel\", touchHandler, true);\n```\nWhat the edit does is to add the touch event listeners to the div where the drawing happens instead of the whole page. This means links won't be affected but drawing will work as expected.\nI've tested it on my iPad and it seems to be working. Let me know if it solves the issue for you as well :)\n. Brilliant!\n. I've done a bit of testing and managed to reproduce the issue.\nWhen you tap simultaneously on a link in the index bar and on a link in the main view, the index bar loads the page the link is pointing to, instead of delegating that to the main view. The main view works as expected.\nUsually the index bar disappears after this kind of interaction. In this situation, when reopening the index bar, the content will be blank. However, if we disable hiding, the index bar remains visible and shows the page that should have been loaded in the main view.\nI'm still working on a fix, this is the current situation of this ticket ;)\n. It should be fixed now. If you can give a spin to the latest version on master and let us know whether that fixes it for you, that would be great!\n. Thanks for reporting this. I managed to reproduce it: it is indeed the case that, at the moment, index.html is a reserved filename regardless of where it sits in the folder hierarchy.\nWe will be fixing this eventually, but given the easy workaround you provided it's not top priority at the moment :)\n. And by the way, looking at this bug gave me an idea to solve issue #335. So thanks for the serendipitous moment ;)\n. Just to be clear, is this the rule you are referring to?\n\ninit methods must be instance methods and must return an Objective-C pointer type. Additionally, a program is ill-formed if it declares or contains a call to an init method whose return type is neither id nor a pointer to a super-class or sub-class of the declaring class (if the method was declared on a class) or the static receiver type of the call (if it was declared on a protocol).\n\n(from the ARC Specification)\nWere you getting any explicit errors with the old code?\n. Merged into master, thanks for your contribution! :)\n. That might be the first case of a self-reporting bug that I see ;)\nSeriously though, thanks for sharing this. I think you've stumbled into an encoding issue: those quotes are probably not supported in the page character set.\nThe ones you used successfully in the past were probably standard ASCII quotes, such as \" \" (as opposed to \u201c \u201d, which you usually get when pasting from another application such as Word).\n. I've been trying to reproduce this in the simulator, but haven't got anywhere.\nThe quotes are not displayed correctly in the page, but the app is not crashing.\n. I guess you are referring to issue #335.\nCan you add some more details? (I know you added some to the other issue, but it would help to have more and to have them in this issue).\nSome useful details to start with:\nDo you have the latest released version (3.2) or the latest development version (master branch)?\nIs it happening an all the links or just some of them? Is it happening when you click two links at the same time? That was the trigger with issue #335.\n. Hello @mbayona, I'm closing the issue as there are no new developments for it.\nPlease feel free to reopen if you have more details.\n. Let's see if I understand what you are trying to do: you want to use sections of code from Baker in your own application to manage navigation through a series of pages loaded from HTML files. Is that correct?\nIf it is, I'm afraid it's not going to be that easy: Baker's code is not modular enough, at this point, that you can just grab a function from it and reuse it.\nI guess, in the case you're reporting, the function is expecting to be called inside a RootViewController, so it won't work if you call it from another class without making some changes.\nPS: I edited your post to get the code to display properly ;)\n. What are the media queries you are using? How do you determine whether they were or were not detected?\n. Pretty cool, kudos!\nBefore we can merge this, I think we should trim down the code that needs to be included in each page. It would be ideal if we could add just a single line (the inclusion of a single JS file that takes care of the listener initialisation).\nBy the same token, it should be possible to have the initialisation JS add the bookmark div to the DOM (as it is position: fixed anyway, it shouldn't matter where it sits in the DOM tree).\nThe other issue I have is, I want to make sure the image used to represent the bookmark is compatible with our license and can be included in Baker with no restrictions. The PNG included in the pull request looks suspiciously similar to the one in iBooks, which I don't think would fit the bill ;)\nAs a last comment: this wouldn't prevent us from merging your code, but it would be nice if it used Local Storage instead of Web SQL Database, which is officially deprecated by the W3C :)\n. Just tested: I can confirm the bug. We will look into it, thanks!\n. A first quick investigation shows that the problem is the toolbar width, which is far more than 1024px. The action button is thus displayed out of the viewport.\nA related issue is the size of the view and the webView in ModalViewController, which are 768 (instead of 1024, as should be in landscape).\nThis may prove to be related, so I'm pasting it here as a reminder: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2664980/uiscreen-applicationframe-returning-incorrect-rectangle-on-landscape-application\n. It is indeed possible to have the index view on the left side. In that case, it will slide from the left, not from below.\nAt the moment it is not possible to have the index view on top or on the right side: that would require rewriting a fair amount of code.\n. It should be as easy as creating an index.html page that is only as wide as you want the index bar to be and it scrolls vertically.\nIf you're only supporting one orientation, you can also force the size of the index bar by setting -baker-index-width inside book.json (see https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters)\n. Glad to hear you managed to solve your issue!\nAs for including in a future release, I think this solution covers a very specific case, and it has some drawbacks that we would have to iron out (it makes it less clear from a UX perspective when opening internal vs. external pages, it needs some special handling for Safari).\nAll in all, I don't think this would be a good trade-off for the official release.\nWe'll keep the issue marked as Contribution, however, so other users in need of the same functionality can find it and apply your patch.\n. Hi @FranG I just managed to reproduce (and hotfix) the issue.\nLooks like it's a miscalculation in the goDownInPage function: it adds the current offset of the page to the target offset - which is why it ends up scrolling much more than it should.\nThe first time you click on a link, the goDownInPage function is called, while every other time the UIWebView just takes care of it - which is why all subsequent taps are ok.\nI'll have to do some more testing to make sure this fix does not break something else, but here is what you can do in the meantime to fix it in your code: change line 1578 of RootViewController.m from\nint targetOffset = currentPageOffset+[offset intValue];\nto\nint targetOffset = [offset intValue];\nLet me know if this solves the issue for you.\n. We have fixed various scrolling issues in commit c33a120c751c8e87652a3a144d58e29c2ffd31eb, try it out and let us know if it solves your issue.\n. Hi @bahmet, do you still have this issue? If not, I'll do some cleaning and close the thread.\n. We will test again. In the meantime, the Dropbox link to the page you posted in your first comment seems to be broken now. Can you upload again the page that's giving you problems?\nBtw I assume you already did a cleanup. Just in case, here's how: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Proper-cleanup\n. Congrats on publishing your app!\nUnfortunately the Apple Store approval process has always been pretty random. There's not much we can do on that front.\n. No worries. Glad to know it's ok now ;)\n. A note for completeness sake.\nI just reproduced the issue with Baker 3.2 and Laker 1.4. I had no issue with pushing the index bar content up and down, but there is definitely a problem with horizontal scrolling, as the index bar cannot be completely scrolled.\nHowever, this has been fixed in the master branch, so the fix will be included in the upcoming 3.2.1 release.\n. It is not possible with the current code.\nWe have a feature, slated for release 4.1, that concerns communicating the current page to the index bar (see issue #350). That solution could be conceivably adapted to your needs.\nYou could of corse implement it yourself, if you wanted to. Unfortunately it's not planned for the near future.\n. I am assuming this is solved :)\n. Merging this thread with issue #422 by @rodrigors3012.\nThe gist of that issue is: you open a link in the modal view, close it before the content has loaded, and this causes the Baker application to crash.\n. I'm assuming this is solved. Feel free to reopen if it isn't ;)\n. Brilliant!\n. Why have you had to modify so many files?\nTo get the test to be as simple as possible, I'd try:\n1. Compiling the example project with no modifications, just to make sure it is working fine\n2. Replacing the code for one of the existing pages (maybe not the first one) with the Leaflet code\nIf this fails to give you any meaningful insights, try removing or adding the Leaflet CSS and Javascript includes one by one, until you find exactly where the issue is ;)\n. Yup. What I mean is: don't add any new page, just put the code in an existing one.\nWhat's the sample you used btw?\n. Cool!\n. Just to clarify: you open a link in the modal view, close it before the content has loaded, and this causes the Baker application to crash?\n. And is it the same issue you're talking about in #406? If that's the case, I'd rather move the whole discussion to that thread.\n. Brilliant, I'll close this one then :)\n. Thanks for fixing this!\nUnfortunately the commits are not very clean and merging them like this would pollute the repo history a bit.\nDo you think you could submit another pull request with the same fix? An ideal pull request would only contain changes to the lines that you had to edit. If you look at the current diff, there are a lot of changes that - I assume - are due to your editor changing the indentation for some blocks of code.\nIn addition, this would get rid of the commit with the merge conflict ;)\nIf you can do that, we'll be happy to test it and include it in our master branch.\n. Urban Airship has already been mentioned in issue #292 - but I'm assuming you know that, given that the last comment in that thread is yours ;)\nWe have never used UA ourselves, let's see if someone else can help.\n. For releases (of which the latest is 3.2) we have a changelog in the README: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/#changelog\nFor more fine-grained information, you can look at the commit messages in the master branch: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/commits/master\n. Hi @zenz I have merged your contribution in commit 7ed867a9951c36670a2172bf406bb2dc6bcbd31c.\nUnfortunately the pull request cannot be closed automatically: I had to amend the commit to clean it up a little more and Github does not recognise it. That's why I'm referencing it from this comment.\nThanks for your contribution! :)\n. Yup, that's what I did. Thanks to Git, commits can be modified while retaining the original committer (that is, you).\nIt's only fair to give credit where it is due, so thanks again for contributing ;)\n. Unfortunately there's no API to do that yet.\nIf you want to implement the behaviour with Javascript and a button in the page, have a look at the shouldStartLoadWithRequest function.\nTo show/hide the index view you can use the setIndexViewHidden method. E.g., to hide the view:\n[indexViewController setIndexViewHidden:YES withAnimation:YES];\n. That would require writing some HTML, javascript and ObjC code. It's not exceedingly difficult, but I'm afraid we cannot commit to developing a custom solution at this point.\nMaybe someone who's had the same issue in the past will be able to send you some code :)\n. Hi @fernandomedrano, sorry for the delay.\nThe toggleStatusBar function is a toggle, which means it will close the bar when it is open and open it when it is closed. This of course requires knowing what the current status of the bar is (open or close).\nI don't think isViewLoaded is going to help you: the index bar is always loaded, it's just hidden outside the viewport.\n. Hi @vascoc, have you managed to solve your issue in the end? :)\n. Hello @bahmet, I'm sorry we lost sight of this issue for a while.\nI've had a look at the app you sent us via email: the problem was that the book folder had been added as a group , not as a folder reference.\nFrom issue #59:\n\nSelect \"Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)\", \"Create folder references for any added folders\" and \"Add to targets\" to your desired target.\n. Closing as it is now resolved.\n. Hi @trashoid, any news?\n. I'm closing this as it has gone stale. Feel free to reopen if you need it.\n. We have updated our libraries (and removed an additional warning in our code), in commits c97bbea96f86ea96fd3e9b1ac765b96071f97c9e (SSZipArchive), 5a4187388e475c7209d27aa611e14e7da67ce61f (JSONKit) and 3f056d474932c64f5f094fe445da1573316e4012 (Constants.h).\n\nThis means the only warnings left are the AQGridView ones. Unfortunately we are already using the latest version of the library.\n. Hello @ahmetomer, I'm sorry but I could not reproduce the issue on my iPad.\nWhich version of Baker are you running? Is it the master branch on https://github.com/Simbul/baker ?\n. I can't give you solutions, but a couple of pointers you may find interesting.\nNewsstand support is an ongoing discussion you can find in issue #100.\nPush notifications have been discussed in issue #292 (Urban Airship in #426, but I think you have ruled that out). That's a very long thread, so I'll point out EasyAPNS, which was proposed in that discussion and seemed to work for someone.\n. Good to hear it's working! I'm closing the issue as it is now solved.\n. Just a quick note: if you download a book using book:// as explained in the wiki link above, the new book will replace the old one - even if you close and reopen the app. Baker will take care of writing the files on the device.\n. We just finished investigating the issue. The short version is: make sure Introduction.html in lakerbook is saved as UTF8.\nLonger version: we could reproduce the bug, but we also noticed that the crash was happening even when embedding lakerbook as the default book in Baker.\nThis ruled out both downloading and multi-book management as possible causes.\nWe tracked down the crash to a line in PageTitleLabel.m that was parsing the HTML file to extract its <title>. Unfortunately this function is not as resilient as the one loading the HTML into a UIWebView, so the wrong encoding can make it fail.\nWe have added a guard (in commit e6dca88) that should hopefully make situations like this one easier to debug in the future. It will also silently fail for that specific page, without crashing the whole application.\n@RichHelms please let us know if saving Introduction.html as UTF8 fixes your original issue.\n. Also, @danupoyner, while investigating this issue we ran into a bug that prevented the default book from being loaded when closing a downloaded book.\nHave you discovered (and fixed) the same bug, by any chance? I'm a bit puzzled, as I can't imagine how you could have even loaded the second book, given that.\nWe have fixed it in c113173, have a look in case that rings a bell - I'm very curious to know ;)\nAnd, just to be clear, this has nothing to do with resolving this issue - just an aside.\n. My guess would be that a double tap causes the index bar to open and this causes focus to be transferred to the index bar itself. \nI'd have to do some testing to be sure, but it seems to make sense to me. \nOn 8 Sep 2012, at 08:24, timeinline notifications@github.com wrote:\n\ni use custom events fired on window blur and focus,but when i tap twice,the events also fired,could you tell me why?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I downloaded the book (4.zip) and tried it with the latest version on master: seems to be working well for me.\n\nWhat do you mean exactly when you say that Xcode is stuck when loading the book?\n. Ok, are you using the master branch of Baker or are you using the fork by nin9creative?\nIn case you're using the latter, you should really be asking for help in their issue tracker, as they're definitely going to be able to help you better.\n. You're welcome :)\n. Hello @timeinline, I've just put together a proof of concept and I can't reproduce the issue.\nI've added this code to the bottom of Part1-01.html (just before the closing </body> tag), in our sample book:\njavascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.onfocus = function () { document.getElementById(\"page\").innerHTML = \"focus event has fired! \" + Math.random(); };\n</script>\nEvery time I load that page, I see the focus event has fired message replacing the page. I've also added a random number to the message, so you can see that the JavaScript function is called every time the page is loaded.\nCan you try the code above and let me know whether it is working for you as well?\nOn a side note, please consider that we are working on Baker in our spare time, so don't panic if we are not able to work on issues straight away ;)\n. @sevirinov if you have no more questions I'll close the issue, is that alright?\n. We have tested the fix for the orientation bug and confirmed it works, so I'll be closing this issue.\n. Hey @anjimi, have you had any luck in solving this?\n. Closing, as the issue's gone stale.\n. Pull request merged. Thanks for the contribution!\nCan we consider this issue closed, then?\n. Actually, I've just run a test by adding a Vimeo iframe to a page and it does indeed not play.\nA solution may be the one detailed in this comment on StackOverflow. Haven't tested it, but it may be something worth trying.\n. So not even the StackOverflow comment I posted above solved the iframe issue for you?\n. Fixed in d92f5d440c018e5a256ebe34d569de38b3281906.\n. Still needs some work, but it's definitely a step in the right direction, thanks!\nThis partially fixes #519.\nWe will revert the changes to the AQGridView library, as it's better not to change the code for external libraries. You may consider submitting a pull request to the AQGridView project, though :)\n. I guess that this is a fix for this iOS6 bug, is that right?\n. See #510 for more info on the bug.\n. Hi @CatherineEng,\nI can see the button just fine with the latest version from master. Can you elaborate a bit on that bug?\n\n. Hi @CatherineEng.\nIt looks like the issue is that you're not actually using the screenshots mode at all. Your log should say:\n2012-11-02 03:24:50.038 MyApp[8509:15203] rendering type: screenshots\ninstead of\n2012-11-02 03:24:50.038 MyApp[8509:15203] rendering type: three-cards\nSorry for the obvious question, but have you made sure the -baker-rendering is correctly set to screenshots in your book.json? :)\n. Yes, that's how it's supposed to work: if you provide a screenshots path, screenshots won't be automatically generated (since Baker can't be sure the provided path is writable).\nIt's in a footnote in the wiki page, but I'll reword it to make it a bit more clear.\nI'll also close this issue if that's ok with you :)\n. First of all, kudos for the work! I haven't looked at the code yet but that's definitely a major feature you're introducing there :)\nMy suggestion would be to keep the pull request changes at a minimum (i.e. keeping the hybrid mode out of it).\nThis would make it easier for you to get to the point where you can submit a proper pull request and it would make it easier for us to review the pull request and bring it in.\n. Have you tried getting in touch with the authors of some of the published Baker magazine that already have a shelf?\nThere's at least a couple of them in our showcase, and I believe one was based on your fork.\n. The most interesting log line is:\nSet size for IndexView to 1x1 (constrained from 1x1)\nThis means your index bar is not being displayed because Baker thinks its content has no size. This can usually be solved by fiddling with meta viewport declarations a bit.\nGiven how random the issue seems to be, it may be due to some unpredictable javascript in the index page. Do you have anything of the sort?\nA solution - although not the most elegant - would be to constrain the size of the index bar by setting the related properties in book.json, e.g.:\njson\n...\n\"-baker-index-width\": 361,\n\"-baker-index-height\": 1024,\n...\n. With App Store review policies it's always hard to say something for certain.\nHowever, the way I read that is that you should use the NK download facilities for Newsstand issues - which Baker is already doing.\nAs far as I can see, NK downloads are separate from push notifications: push notifications are essentially a way of triggering a download.\n. Great job fixing this!\nI think we should suggest developers always provide the hi-resolution version and Baker scales it down when needed.\nThis seems to be the approach that Apple is taking on their guidelines and it's much more linear.\n. Pull request #540 has been merged in. Thanks for the contribution @nin9creative!\n. Hello.\nAt the moment, Baker only supports free subscriptions. You're correct in thinking that, eventually, the \"name\" and \"reference name\" fields will have to match, but right now Baker does not contain any logic to display prices or talk to the App Store to complete the purchase.\nAlso, at the moment Baker only supports two modes:\n1. Newsstand-based shelf with downloads and a free subscription (and eventually individual prices and paid subscriptions)\n2. Local shelf (no Newsstand) with books bundled in the application, no downloads or purchases\nThe first feature will definitely be implemented eventually, the second might be, but it may take some time.\nAs for the compilation issue, which version of Xcode are you using? UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAll was introduced in iOS 6, so you may need to update to a newer version.\n. At the moment that't the expected behaviour: refresh is essentially a facility for checking whether new issues are available.\nI agree that refreshing all metadata would be a nice-to-have, so I've marked this as a feature request. It probably won't be in 4.0, unless we find some time to sneak it in ;)\n. What happens if you point it to our test JSON?\nhttp://bakerframework.com/newsstand-books/list.json\nWe've used that multiple times, so it could help rule out one possible issue.\n. I've removed the comma from the example, as I agree it's a bit misleading.\nThe gfx folder is nothing new: it has always been there, as far as I can remember. In any case, that's not part of the book.json specification: it's simply something we decided to have in our sample book, but nothing prevents you from calling it foo or even storing all the files in the root folder.\nWhat has changed with 4.0 is we went from a single book folder to a books folder containing multiple books, but the structure of the single book is still the same.\n. Highlight them all and zip them together. The important bit is not to zip the folder that contains them, but the files themselves.\n. There is a way to customise that, you just need to change the string corresponding to SHELF_NAVIGATION_TITLE.\nAll customisable strings have been recently moved to Baker/Supporting Files/en.lproj/Localizable.strings, which is probably why you couldn't find it.\nIn passing, this should also make it possible to localise the Baker interface in any language ;)\n. Glad to see it's solved :)\nThe \"Updating Price...\" problem is just because there's no corresponding product ID in iTunes Connect.\nOf course if you want your issue to be free there's no reason to create one, so in your case I'd say it's ok not to have one in shelf.json.\n. It should always go in the Newsstand folder. Make sure it's not a Standalone version that you compiled in the past: apps in the simulator tend to hang around ;)\n. @callaght thanks for reporting this. Coincidentally, the fix we ended up implementing is conceptually the same as the one you suggested: kudos!\n. First of all, have you tried a Proper-cleanup?\nSecond, is your server returning the right response for PURCHASES_URL?\n. Single purchase works in a slightly different way, so that's not a guarantee things are fine.\nWhat happens if you click \"BUY\" on an issue that should be covered by the subscription? Are you able to download it straight away or do you get prompted to buy it?\n. To me, that is suggesting that Magrocket is not actually \"unlocking\" the issue.\nThe fact that you buy a subscription is not enough, you also have to have a way of associating the issues you want unlocked with that subscription (Magrocket will do that for you, but I'm not sure what rules it's using).\n. I tend to change the value of Product Name (productReference). That still causes a larger diff than I'd like, but at least all the changes are confined to project.pbxproj.\n. This is the field I usually change (I'm on Xcode 5 beta now):\n\nI don't think you can gitignore project.pbxproj as it contains a lot of other stuff as well, but if you have a branch of the baker repo where you've committed your product name you should be able to pull in 99% of changes from master without getting into conflicts.\n. Make sure you delete the app from the simulator before you switch from iPad to iPhone. That usually solves it for me.\n. > This email address would be stored on a server so that if that user got another iPad they could simply enter their email address on this new iPad and their subscription would be available on that new iPad and all of the content they have paid for would be downloaded.\nThis is exactly what restoring purchases does. The explanation you got from the Apple rep does not make any sense to me.\nIf you want to try and get in touch with them again with a bit more information, here's how purchases work in Baker+MagRocket:\n1. Baker generates a unique identifier to track the specific instance of the app (i.e. this does not map 1:1 to a user). This uuid is used by MagRocket to know what the app is allowed to download.\n2. When a user buys anything (a single issue or a subscription), the App Store saves the purchase against the user Apple ID and sends a receipt to Baker.\n3. Baker sends the receipt for the purchase and the uuid to MagRocket, where the receipt is checked against the Apple verification server and the issue (or group of issues) is unlocked.\nNow, here's how restoring purchases works:\n1. When a user opens the app on a new device, Baker will generate a new uuid. There is yet no way to get to previously purchased content at this point\n2. However, when the user Restores purchases, the App Store will send to Baker the receipts for all of the user's purchases (issues and subscriptions).\n3. Baker sends the receipts for the purchases and the uuid to MagRocket, where the receipts are checked against the Apple verification server and the issues are unlocked.\nYou can see that the steps are essentially the same in both scenarios, with the only difference that step 2. is applied to multiple receipts when restoring and to a single one when buying.\nIn short, Baker generates a uuid for each installation of the app. When restoring purchases, MagRocket will associate all purchases with the new uuid, effectively \"cloning\" the purchase history of the user, so that they will be able to access all the content they purchased on a newly installed app.\n. Here's what section 11.6 of the App Store Review Guidelines says:\n\n11.6 Content subscriptions using IAP must last a minimum of 7 days and be available to the user from all of their iOS devices\n\nIn the review, they quoted the iTunes Connect Developer Guide (even though I couldn't find that specific quote in there):\n\n...subscriptions must be provided on all devices associated with a user. In App Purchase expects subscriptions to be delivered through an external server that you will provide. You must provide infrastructure to deliver subscriptions to multiple devices.\n\nAs far as I can see, Baker completely meets these requirements by the Restore Purchases button. The only thing I can think of now is that Apple wants all devices belonging to a user to be in sync.\nIt's not simply a matter of making the content available: supposing a user had an iPad and an iPhone and they bought a subscription on their iPad, all issues covered by that subscription should be pushed to both devices simultaneously.\nIf that is the case, entering just the email won't work: you would be able to access all purchases for a user just by knowing their email (which is fairly trivial).\n@MaverickWar have you asked them about the \"short code\" approach?\n. The first step should be to understand how serious Apple is with this policy. We all know how capricious the approval process can be sometimes, and 1 case is sadly not enough to extrapolate that this is a new policy they'll enforce from now on.\nIf they're serious, we need some clear requirements on what they want. This is a pretty big feature and it's definitely not something I'd like to implement in the dark.\n. @folletto I just watched the WWDC video from 2012 (Session 308 - Managing Subscriptions with In-App Purchase). As the comment on Stackoverflow pointed out (and I had totally missed until I watched the video), the solution using iCloud applies to non-renewable subscriptions, which is something Baker doesn't even support.\nWith non-renewable subscriptions an app can rely much less on iTunes Connect (e.g. there's no facility to Restore all purchases), which is why a custom solution for managing subscriptions is needed.\n. I've also watched the latest session from WWDC 2013 (Session 305 - Using Store Kit for In-App Purchases).\nThe presenter is mentioning an optional user registration, but again it is only for non-renewable subscriptions. For auto-renewable subscription there's no mention of any user registration. Indeed, the presenter is stressing the importance of offering a button to Restore purchases.\nSo, stupid question for @callaght, @DrByrnes and @MaverickWar: are you sure you only created auto-renewable subscriptions?\n. @MaverickWar just for clarity: you tried submitting 3 times, with:\n- 1 paid auto-renewable subscription and some free issues\n- 1 free subscription and 1 paid non-renewable subscription (what about issues?)\n- 1 paid auto-renewable subscription and some paid issues (I guess that's what you meant as opposed to \"paid subscriptions\" again)\nand they where all rejected by Apple with the same exact reason above?\n. I'm afraid we're stuck until Apple comes out with something clearer. In all the videos, posts and documents I've read there's nothing at all about user registration for renewable subscriptions. We need clearer requirements before we implement something of this magnitude.\n. @Barney2324 could you post the message Apple sent you? It'd be useful to know the details of the rejection.\n. @callaght @jeffreypharrington, as it has nothing to do with App rejection, could you please take the discussion to a separate thread? :)\n. It sounds like you're looking for free subscription + paid issues.\nThe framework supports it, though I guess you'll have to make it clear to your users what do they get (or don't get) with the subscription.\n. Thanks for the pul request!\n. What are you trying to do exactly?\nThe two methods in PurchasesManager are only a fallback and should not be relied upon.\nPurchases are listed in the _purchases array in PurchasesManager.\n. That's totally appropriate, don't worry ;)\n. Yes that's a good point. Can you open a separate issue about that please? :)\n. Purchases on the App Store follow a transactional model:\n1. You purchase something within Baker and get a receipt - this creates a transaction object\n2. Baker sends the receipt to the server (request)\n3. The server checks the receipt\n4. The server unlocks content\n5. The server tells Baker that content was unlocked (response)\n6. Baker finishes the transaction by calling the App Store and confirming everything is ok\nSteps between 2 and 5 are contained in the request/response cycle for the call to PURCHASE_CONFIRMATION_URL.\nIf at any time during the 6 steps something goes wrong, Baker does not finish the transaction. This means that, the next time the app is started, steps 1 to 6 will be attempted again. This should make absolutely sure the user never pays for something they cannot receive (though it might not be the best user experience).\nI've just tested by having my PURCHASE_CONFIRMATION_URL endpoint return a status 400 (instead of 200) and this alert is displayed:\n\n. Yes, we did notice it, but it's against master as opposed to being against the ios7 branch we're working on at the moment, which makes reading the diff pretty difficult.\nWe decided to have a look at it after merging ios7 into master, but we still had to fix the font sizes in the meantime :wink: \n. @drewmantoo please use the new Baker issue tracker for questions: https://github.com/BakerFramework/baker/issues\nThis one is not in use anymore: it's only open as a reference :wink: \n. It sounds like you're talking about #1133 now. Do you think we can close this issue and continue the discussion on the other one?\n. It sounds like an issue with the server. Have a look at #752.\n. You're right, the behaviour of BakerIssueOpen and BakerIssueClose is not very consistent.\nThe cleanest solution would probably be to pass in the IssueViewController instance in both cases (instead of passing in the BakerViewController instance for the latter event).\nThat would require some nontrivial refactoring of the analytics component, however. In addition, you already found a workaround, so we'll close the issue - but thanks for pointing this out!\n. That's not a sort of cache, it's simply how Baker works ;)\nThe assumption is that unique issue names in the shelf will point to the same file. Of course if the shelf JSON breaks the assumption, Baker will get confused.\nHave you tried assigning different names to the different localisations of the same file?\n. ",
    "folletto": "I've just tested and pushed the fix into the codebase.\nThank you! You're Baker's first contributor! :D\n. Great Sander, this topic is your house then for the discussions on that feature. ;)\n. It should be easy to implement now a \"manga mode\" since we don't have anymore the page numbers (we use the page titles) and we could define a flag -baker-start-at-page = -1 to define the starting page, where negative numbers are counted from the end (1 = first page, -1 = last page).\n. It should be easy to implement now a \"manga mode\" since we don't have anymore the page numbers (we use the page titles) and we could define a flag -baker-start-at-page = -1 to define the starting page, where negative numbers are counted from the end (1 = first page, -1 = last page).\n. . The progress bar exists, but appears only when you're scrolling. ;)\n. For the ToC, I think it should be handled and styled by the book author, with hyperlinks and everything the author feels it's ok.\nWhat do you think about this approach?\n. - Yes, for now it's that. We are trying to add as less \"administration debris\" as possible, in order to allow book authors to be in total control of the look. It's not probably feasible completely, but we are trying. \n- Yes, the ToC is the starting point. Consider that Baker's ebooks don't have real \"pages\", but \"chapters\", so if you link the chapter to the ToC and the ToC to the chapter, you're set. That said however, I got your point, it could be annoying. Do you have any suggestion with low \"admin debris\"?\n(after the discussion I'll split this issue in two since we are talking of two different things)\n. yes, I think it's possible in JS since we have all the events to do that and the animation will make it discoverable, so not entirely bad. :)\nBut I agree, and the solution you just proposed could be a good point in the right direction. Are you able to make a test to see if it's possible to load an HTML avoiding the \"brief flash of menu\" effect? If it works, that could be a good answer. :)\n. I'll close this one for the time being, however mainly because we are talking about two different things here instead of one. :)\nI'd say that:\n. Progress: it's already there and for now it seems working well (\u00bb duplicate).\n. ToC: it breaks the principle \"the design is all inside designer's hands\", so it's probably a topic we need to raise when the HPub standard is a little more formed (\u00bb delayed).\nHowever, about the ToC there might be different opinions so in that case feel free to open another, more focused, issue. ;)\n. Thanks for the suggestion, but at this time we don't think that Baker should support any pre-processing of the ebook because we think it's outside the objectives of a book engine.\nIn more detail, I can add:\n- A pre-processor will add computing weight without a real added value for the user (it's a task that should be done before the publishing of the book).\n- You can use or build an HTML pre-processor to create the required HTML files (up to the extreme probably of building a barebones Rails app to generate those HTMLs :D).\n- HTML5 supports the  tag, and that's the proper HTML way of doing partials, even if I agree that's not the same thing, that's probably close enough if you badly need partials but you can't for some reason pre-process them.\nThat said I hope it's clear enough the reasoning behind this choice. ;)\n. I think you can keep open the pull request and incrementally improve it until it's ready for merging. It's quite a nice feature of GitHub. ;)\n. Could you explain it a bit more? We could always put them back. ;)\n. Just a quick note: amazing work. :)\nTomorrow I'll test out everything. :)\n. Argh. Well.. yes.\n. I've just tested and I got a few issues remaining:\n1. The white background is now the textured background seen when you go out of scroll in some situations, is it for debug reasons?\n2. Quite every time I do this: portrait, then switching landscape, then moving on the next page, then switching portrait again the webview stays sized as landscape\nForcing the orientaton via plist works like a charm, I think that's ok. :)\n. Oh ok, I'll wait then. :)\n. I think that the good answer is going to be: \"when it works\". :)\nI hope we are able to do that before christmas, but it's really something that involves the developer of this branch and the subsequent merge, so we'll see.\nIf you want to help him fixing the last bugs it could be also a good way to move that date early. ;)\n. Great!\nI'm a bit busy too, so for now I'll wait. ;)\n. We know it's priority, we'll merge once the branch is completed. :)\n. Horizontal for just one page? Well, it's tricky, because I think we are going to achieve \"whole book\" orientation not single page one. However, did you try placing the whole table inside? When you exceed the page size the book is still browseable, just you have to scroll right first.\n. Tonight we did a joint session and moved this feature ahead. Now we are working on a different tree from master, autorotate, because it's not functional yet, many bugs to fix ahead of us but the core functionality is there, taken from svdgraaf's branch.\n. Uhm I don't quite understand what's the problem about. Could you open a new issue and describe it a little more? :)\nThanks! :)\n. Ok, but could you open a specific issue? ;)\n. Note: this is going to change slightly the handling of page numbers.\nNow we are using 1.html, 2.html, but with the alphabetical ordering now 1.html is followed by 10.html, so we need to state the change clearly when we are going to release this update in the downloadable package.\n. Yes, but it's not feasible: too many kinds of book, too many needs. Even making one book with the current numbering is a pain, so alphabetically the author retains full control. :)\n. Consider that every setting we add to the standard, the less it's probable it could became a real standard.\nAlphabetical ordering works already well without any kind of setting, and that's the assumed default for many systems, from how the filesystem shows you the files, to how we manage chapter numbers, allowing also numbering if you want to. No setting needed, works outside of the box intuitively. :)\n. Confirmed and tested, it works. :)\n. Yup, that's something that is going to happen already if they are ordered alphabetically. Just, if you have more than 10 page, it's going to be: 01.name.html, 02.name.html and so on. :)\n. I'll re-open this. :)\n. Just to keep track of everything, we tried to ask on StackOverflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4597118/intercept-unused-tap-events-in-a-uiwebview\n. I'd go for the \"never shows\", most of the things we see are going to take it off (and forcing it on changes the page size). However, that's a critical function to evolve this app, so either we are able to solve it, or to find another way to show \"additional features\". :(\n. To remove that feature it means that basically we can't evolve the platform more than it is now. The trigger at the touch is critical to allow the evolution of the platform, to perform more actions. If you don't like it, just disable it if your books, but this is critical for us. :)\n. Exactly. For now it's something still useful, but simple and non-intrusive. Until we are able to perfect it it's pointless to try moving forward. :)\n. Upvote then! ;)\n. The feature is almost there, we are putting the finishing touches to make it work correctly. :)\n. We developed this thing a little differently. So:\n1. It handles downloaded zip books.\n2. It can handle book:// links from inside a book (see protocol issue #14) and download a book.\n3. The special book://local URL brings back to the internal book.\n4. The downloaded book stays in memory until a links goes back to book://local.\n. Released.\n. No, it stays there until a new book is loaded. :)\n. Ok book updated, with some minor fixes to make.\n1. Landscape view\n2. Background image\n. Done. :)\n. Yes, it's one of the biggest part I'm working on, I didn't open the issue because I wasn't expecting to discuss this part so soon and I need some time to synthesize what I already have, but surely we can start collecting feedback.\nI'll mark this issue as discussion. :)\nI can already say:\n- the least number of mandatory parts\n- no new syntaxes as much as possible\nFrom those assumptions, hpub as you see today is already quite there: with alphabetical ordering and zipping it's complete imho, content wise.\nWe still need somewhere to specify a sort fo \"meta\" or \"manifest\" container. For the discussion I had up until now this is the current dratf:\n- HTML syntax\n- must contain title\n- must contain author\n- must contain URI identifier with specific \"ebook\" protocol\n- should contain width (in whole pixels?)\n. Yes, but please always keep in mind that we need to strive for simplicity at least for version 1.0 of the HPub standard. If we start to add parameters, settings, thumbnails, etc. we'll make the life more difficult to book creators. Since HPub is not yet a \"standard\", we have first to aim for a good baseline, simple and clean, and on that build extensions (i.e. navigation, thumbnails).\nFor example: I was thinking if it was possible to dynamically generate the thumbnails from the HTML pages: that would allow the author to have ZERO effort and allows the user to get real 1:1 matching thumbnails.\nHowever, I like the idea of having page thumbs that have the same name of the HTML with a PNG extension. That could be a good, minimal-effort, extension :)\n. Exactly.\nLet's see that solution how could work out:\n1. How would a user open the nav?\n2. How could we make it so it's usable consistently (adapted, but consistent) no different page sizes (vertical, horizontal for example)?\n. Yes, I completely agree that it would be better to join our effort, also because Zhook already has some degree of adoption. I tried to think about solutions to solve the differences, but so far I wasn't able to meet our needs using the Zhook format.\nBasically the point, as of today, is: Zhook is almost a subset of HPub focused on a normal book experience.\nBecause HPub and Zhook are both HTML5 zipped, but HPub supports multiple files, while Zhook only one.\nReasons for HPub:\n1. It's not book-only. HPub targets everything from book to magazines.\n2. It's based on a different interaction model made possible by digital readers: multiple chapters of unlimited length one on the side of the other.\n3. We are focused on the simplest possible approach for the whole production chain of complete multimedia experiences.\n4. It doesn't prescribe anything to the reader different from what's already obvious.\n5. It's going to address the cross-referencing of books problem.\nWhy Zhook doesn't work for each one of those points:\n1. It's book only. It's \"the best of breed EPUB\". HPub isn't, but allows a great book experience too.\n2. Zhook is based on the old epub idea of a \"whole page\". HPub allows that, plus the new natural interaction emerged with the touch devices (Zhook is a subset of HPub).\n3. With one big file, you are just allowing for one person working on it, or you require the editors/programmers/designers to use a versioning system to merge changes. If you split a book in chapters, then you can easily work on one file while another person works on another file. Faster to manage, easy to send, discuss. And since it's not pre-defined, you can organize the files in the best way you want to work with them. We don't even constrain the name of the \"first\" file: it's just alphabetical, exactly what you get from the filesystem. I can go on a lot on this, but as you might understand, it's really intuitive the way we are designing HPub.\n4. Zhook leaves a lot in the hand of Reading Systems: \"the RS must give the  element an id that is unique\", \"the RS may modify the DOM\", \"the RS may split the DOM\". When I'm building a book or a magazine, I want that my reader gets a consistent and determined experience. What if I build a wonderful JS/CSS interaction within my book and the reader \"splits\" it? How do I know? Have I to test every different implementation PLUS the HTML5 evolutions and quirks? Painful.\n5. We are going to create the separated URI reference scheme and add to the HPub standard as a MUST. This is going to allow easy referencing, something that epub didn't get: they have an ID, but what could you do with that? Who would you query? Where's the file? And Zhook just misses it: \"The unique book identifier is an EPUB concept that has no analogy in Zhook. I'm not really a fan of the idea \u2014 it seems like half a solution to a not particularly significant problem\".\nIn the end, think about it: would you build a whole, complex, feature rich website inside a single HTML file? I'm sure not. :)\nThat's why we need to have multiple files. :)\nThat's why HPub and not Zhook.\nBut still: we could make Zhook and HPub ideas converge, if the author wants to (since Zhook to me looks like a single company invention, isn't it?). I also don't really care about the name, I don't really like HPub - and neither Zhook if I have to be clear - so I'm open to suggestions.\n. From your comment, I'm thinking that you are referring a specific usage, both for authors and readers. As I've said before, HPub is born to be wide in scope and address a lot of different usage patterns.\nPoint-by-point, your first comment:\n- Previewability: Since a reader is something external from a book, you can just make a simple JS engine that loads inside any div a book taken from a specific URL, doing exactly the same thing we do inside Baker Framework. I don't think it should be declared inside the book itself, like swf files or m4v files don't have the player embedded inside. No difference.\n- Whole-book operations: you look like having a developer point of view, but even from that point of view the difference between a batch operation on a single file or multiple file is usually the difference between cmd-f and shift-cmd-f. But again, that's a developer's point of view. I'm talking about different chains, where authors deliver content in single articles or chapters. Where editors work on them. Where designers take it in Photoshop, InDesign or Illustrator. Where developers convert them to the right format. It's way more complex, and it's even more complex when you move from books to magazine or interactive books: multiple authors, multiple designers, maybe video experts for multimedia content. As I've said before: you would never do a website in a single HTML file. Plus for HPub.\n- Structure for free: Zhook and HPub share the same structure: HTML5, so I can't see why we are taking about structure, we are on the same ground. We aren't talking of the manifest for structure, but for other things. About structure we're good with the current multifile, HTML5 base, exactly like Zhook. The manifest here is discussed for other reasons. No difference, with a plus for HPub if you need filenames to manage your structure. ;)\n- Reflowability: it isn't a difference, because again, while Zhook inherits from epub and so it focuses on books, HPub don't. So if an author wants reflowability, he gets it. If not? Then it doesn't. HPub gives this choice to the author. Zhook doesn't.\n  HPub is as simple as a website, as flexible as a website.\n  Try doing our published book, \"5x15 in Tokyo\" in epub - you can't. Zhook? Probably, but it's going to be way more complex... unless it's extended to cover the same parts that HPub already does.\nYour second comment:\n1. Different interaction mode: from your comment it seems that you haven't tried the book. Please do. :)\n   HPub is new because it allows an interaction mode that's what it's being used in many digital magazines: scrolling and pagination. With complete design control in the hands of the designers, pixel perfect. With again a choice for the author: if he wants to, he can paginate, otherwise, scroll, or any in between.\n2. Book-only: I'm saying subset just because in some ways the standard is a \"one file version\" of the current, evolving, HPub definition. I'm sorry if it looked harsh, it was just a technical consideration.\n3. Simple: Exactly, I'm trying to avoid the manifesta as much as possible. If HPub is going to use a manifest, will be to add MORE functionality than the one provided today by either epub or Zhook. That's what's boiling.\n4. No prescription: Almost. We already have CSS for that and readers can simply load the CSS they require to work: it's the same. Instead of prescribing \"inject an ID\" the reader can just say \"load this CSS\". It's the same, without injection, and completely in the hands of the reader's hands.\n5. Cross-referencing: I know that epubs position is wrong, and that's what we are planning to solve. I also think that Keith solution misses a big point (too focused on the book side again), but this is another discussion. ;)\n6. Co-working: you're too developer oriented, and book oriented, as I was saying above. HPub solution includes book, but it's not limited at it. :)\nWe can discuss to merge the two standards in one, that would be wonderful, but HPub objectives need multiple files for all the reasons stated here and above. Otherwise you are just making another epub, and that's not something this project is for, that's not something we are receiving loads of enthusiast email, feedback (and more...) for.\nFrom your second comment, I think that you built Zhook explicitly for books, while HPub has a wider approach. That's philosophically different, and leads to all the points we have commented before. But those points are a consequence of that choice\nHowever, if you think about it, as of today the main differences are:\n1. Must have one file -vs- multiple files (No difference).\n2. Must have a specific name -vs- choose you name as long as it's alphabetically ordered (HPub is simpler).\n3. Must include a cover -vs- no cover required (HPub is simpler).\nAfter that, we are discussing a few other things that might require a manifest... or not. I'd like to avoid that, but well... let's settle one discussion before moving to another.\nSo: do you want to join forces? I'll be fine with a shake of hands and a good luck, but I'd really love to join forces, efforts and minds on that.\n. - Scroll: yes, that's why we support also vertical single-page scrolling (tap once at the bottom, nose test passed!). I don't think it's \"perfect\", but seems working well so far. :)\n- Structure: I agree. It's just slightly different with multiple files: you have to aggregate that structural parsing: since HTML5 have not anymore a \"universal\" h1, you can easily think that a group of files is in fact another top level article block, with the titles as h1. Zhook has surely a slight advantage here from my point of view, but not heavy if you want to build a single-html HPub. ;)\n~\nAs I thought, you're surely way ahead of me on the book field. :) I'd love to join the discussion, but I also need to push out of the gate a first draft because we keep receiving a huge amount of emails of people building something with Baker and so I'd like to have something as simple as possible but with one more piece in place than we currently have: the URI (and you might easily guess why).\nI think that if we are going to have a non-merger point, it's due to your focus on book and our focus on page-perfect magazine-like pages. But maybe... it could be just a difference in the same standard.\nEven if...\nI strive for simplicity. :)\n. 1. I agree again on the structure part, but I again say: would you build an entire website using just one HTML5 page? No, and that's for a multitude of reasons. The same reasons apply here: we're moving from \"old\" text-only books to \"new\" interactive, animated, web connected books. A paradigm shift.\n   I can take one from the multitude of reasons: the web idea is already at it's core a hyperlinked book, and I think you can hardly say it doesn't have structure. ;) Since books need to move there, keeping the \"one file\" structure is incredibly limiting to the full potential.\n   And as you said: if you prefer to build a whole website in a single file... good for you!  But that should be a choice, not an obligation, and the same applies for books. :)\n   I want that choice in the hands of authors.\n2. I thought about this, and I think that it boils down to what's your idea of book. You make the jump from \"book\" to \"app\". For me there's a huge middle ground in between, like there's a middle ground between a single HTML page and a multi-continent multi-language flash-enhanced interactive 3-tiers dynamical website. HPub isn't magazine oriented, it's design oriented. It allows books to be designed with pixel precision, being sure on the result. Incidentally, that's something magazine would love too. And that's it. But again, I want to give choice, not impose solutions: you want a book to be fluid, single page, adaptable on multiple screens and devices? Do it. But if you want to simply do a stunning portrait photographic book on the iPad, you should be able too. I want to break free of that constraint about \"ebooks\" being \"just text\". I want to give back power to designers to create the books I loved and I love so much, but in digital form. And ready for the web.\n3. That's another topic. ;) Check first the issue: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues#issue/14\n4. I just want something good, I'm not attached to HPub at all. ;)\n. Oh I'd never say impossible (and I'd never say never... whatever :P). With a good effort and sweat you could always do everything with computers, you know. But I'm trying to be simple, and that's the point. :)\nBut I think it's a good point to move forward the discussion. As a reference: try re-doing \"5x15 in Tokyo\", the book we already published on the store, in Zhook, pixel perfect, with each page starting and ending where the author decided and not where the reader software wanted. And that's a quite simple book. :)\nURI: please, could you move that part on the the other issue so I can comment? This one is already a complex discussion by itself. ;)\n. Are you telling me and every author that is now working on Baker that instead of using a simple, clear and no-explanation solution, identical to the way we are already working, with a technical effort of zero, we should impose an arbitrary set of rules that requires paragraphs of text to be explained to split an HTML5 file? :)\nI suppose I don't have to argue on that, right? :)\n. Er I don't know what to say, because I don't have to change anything in the HPub specification to fit your proposal (HPub's spec today is incredibly simple). So for me it's fine. :D\nJust a note: I'm trying to build a simple spec (see the top of this topic), so I won't probably go too much in detail as you did about metadata, reading systems and previewability. But I think that's a marginal point.\n. May I ask the reason behind those ideas? My guess would be:\n1. Having a clear place for putting metadata, easier for creators\n2. The ability of specifying a subset of files and not all the files\nSo, if I'm right:\n1. Metadata: I completely agree on the principle of having everything in one place. This one was exactly my doubt about frank's suggestion above. Having a single place where I'm sure to find all my metadata is the best solution (both for simpleness and automation). But I'm not sure that modifying the simplicity and cleanliness of the alphabetical sorting part of the spec is worth forcing an index file.\n2. Subset: The current HPub spec already handles this: subfolders. But you're right, I should have made it more clear. I'll edit the spec above. Handling the list with subfolders keeps the amazing simplicity of the list of files, but keeps allowing complex HTML inclusions like the one you were referring to (iframe).\n~\nAs a sidenote for future discussion, note that the alphabetical ordering is a design choice that solves a huge amount of problems at once:\n- Simple for authors, visually: every filesystem will show you the files always in alphabetical order by default. So to know that a file comes before another you just have to look at the filesystem. Dead simple, you don't even have to think about it.\n- Simple for authors, freedom: they can have any kind of internal organization or structure and just use the first part of the filename to reflect it. 001-cover, 002-index, 003-chapter1, 003-chapter2? Do it. Prefer 01, 02, 03? Do it. And so on. Do you want to build a Zhook book with a single file? index, done!\n- Simple for parsers: they just have to get all the files in the zip or in the folder and sort them. This is a basic operation that doesn't require any specialization or any parsing. And can be performed also remotely on webservers: just allow directory listing or add an index.html. ;)\n- Simple as a spec: saying \"the order is alphabetical\" is crystal clear to everybody (well, maybe we have to catch some cases like japanese, chinese and korean, but in that case again is just a matter of building on the shoulder of giants when they built sorting algorithms).\n. @Joseph:\nIndex.html, streamability, linked files... you're building a website Joseph, not a book format! :D\n@elmimmo:\nYes, you're right. However please note that the behaviour is consistent everywhere, with the only exception of OSX UI that treat numbers in a different way, handling sequences more cleanly (1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, 12) instead of overlapping due to proper alphabetical order (1, 10, 11, ..., 19, 2, 20, 21, ...). But that's a OSX variation (aid?) from the norm.\nThe problem you raised about inserting pages is however a good point, I was thinking about it yesterday and I think it's the only big drawback when using alphabetical ordering: \"I need to add a file... oh I have to rename all the following until the last chapter\". \nI still don't feel that the solution lies in hard-linking files internally, because the structure gets hidden away making the work of authors and parser a real pain: \"is this file before or after?\", \"wait, if I add one file here I need to edit the file before and the file after...every time\".\nThe third approach that came into my mind was using an alphabetical default and then if the toc exists in the manifest file, it gets read and takes priority. Handling the sequence in a single, central file makes the content much easily organized and understood, at the price of requiring again another file.\nThere's not obviously clear solution to me here.\n. Joseph's solution isn't just beautiful. Is elegant, simple and clean. But it's designed to solve a different need than the one we're solving here. Otherwise we would have just taken Zhook. Right? :)\nI hope that everybody here also understands that avoiding at all a manifest file is utopian, so we are surely trying to avoid it as much as possible, but not just for a principle: because avoiding it would make it simpler and cleaner.\nBut at one point it's going to appear, and the file ordering might be a reason for that to appear: writing a filename in the right position in a file is without any doubt faster, cleaner and understandable than chaining files together. Just to make an example: to understand a book I'd just have to check it and I can understand, I can even read comments maybe on its structure, and so on, without the need to open each and every file to follow the chaining.\nBut I need a little more feedback to clear up my mind on this because:\n- Alphabetical: while incredibly cleaner, it needs probably a more specific definition of \"alphabetic\" (ISO 12199:2000? Unicode Collation Algorithm?) and is a bit slower when inserting files in some cases.\n- Linking: is always slow, it hides the structure and it's hard to maintain.\n- Manifest: adds a manifest file, while cleaner (even if a little less clean than alphabetical) and understandable (not to forget: commentable).\n. Hi Teo, I agree on most of what you said. I have just a couple of questions:\n1. Do you thing that 3 levels are really needed? Wouldn't be better, for simplicity's sake, to just have alphabetic (simple alphabetical sorting) + declarative (toc)?\n2. What is the need of including subfolders in the alphabetical ordering?\n3. Alphabetical with subfolders or TOC based, the hierarchy wouldn't be visible to anyone, so: how do you expect a complex toc or folder hierarchy to be expressed in the UI?\n. What's the need for that that can't be solved by simply handling multiple HPubs? :)\n. Uhm I'm still missing something in your scenario, I'll try to provide one, slightly different, with a proposed solution.\nLet's start from the magazine workflow.\nThe contributor working independently would do everything that you said, with an html for each article and folders for its assets. Something like:\n- article-ozone-layer.html\n- article-ozone-layer/image1.png\n- article-ozone-layer/image2.png\n- article-ozone-layer/style.css\n- article-ozone-layer/facebook.js\nThe editor takes all the html + assets and merges those together in the HPub, renaming just the html files if required\n- article-01.html\n- article-ozone-layer/image1.png\n- article-ozone-layer/image2.png\n- article-ozone-layer/style.css\n- article-ozone-layer/facebook.js\n- article-02.html\n- article-sequoia/image1.png\n- article-sequoia/image2.png\n- article-sequoia/image3.png\n- article-sequoia/style.css\n- article-sequoia/facebook.js\n- ...\nThis works even without any explicit ToC file description, because the editor just needs to put the HTML files one along the other, with an alphabetical renaming. Nothing else needs to be changed.\nConsider that Baker's interaction model is an extension from the book model, so pages are sequential (linear, not hierarchical), even if unlike physical books each page can scroll vertically. So we are going always to have a flat line somewhere.\nWhere does this example fail from your point of view?\n~\nAbout the ToC UI, we are planning to leave this up again to book authors. There was a suggestion about creating an HTML overlay. The aim here is giving complete control on the book visuals, without any UI element (well, at some point we are probably required to add our own UI, but ToC I think that would be fine if it's managed by the author, both in structure and visual styling).\nDo you think that an automated ToC generation is mandatory?\n. 1. The \"index.html\" idea is a good one. I'd just add a small variation (that maybe was already in your concept): it's not included as a page, it's \"just\" the manifest. Just one question: at first I was thinking about HTML, then after one suggestion above I thought that maybe JSON would be better. What's your opinion for the manifest? HTML or JSON? And why?\n2. Yes, I'm quite convinced about it, but I'm ready to step back if an equally simpler solution exists. However, the dual approach alphabetical + manifest imho works pretty well.\n3. ToC: wouldn't the modified Zhook approach work? Using the HTML5 page structure plus the HTML title tag for the top level sequence (and optionally, reading the ToC in the manifest file)?\n. 1. The alternative for me is between a book.manifest in JSON and HTML, where in one case the JSON is... just JSON, while the HTML version uses \"semantically enriched\" tags to provide the same feature. I'd use HTML to be more \"uniform\", but JSON will look surely more like a data manifest (with a drawback: no comments allowed). No JS-in-HTML.\n. Is it just a problem of the extension (say, still HTML but called index.manifest) or of everything from your point of view?\n. @totanus: that was my first idea too, but I backed a bit when I thought about all the troubles in 1/ perception (\"is it data, or is it a page to be shown?\") and 2/ technical parsing of an HTML file instead of, say, a JSON file.\n@bru: yes, those details are probably fine (even tho I think that a few are going to be optional). Also, due to the discussion above, there's probably going to be a ToC too to override the alphabetical sorting.\n. @Bru: I'm not sure, except that the alphabetical sorting is needed for simplicity imho. Maybe a separated TOC file? If it exists, then it rules the override? :)\n@elmimmo: I agree, great point. Dublin Core should be referenced as a starting baseline. :)\n. @Bru: yes, basics. Extensible, but basics. :D\n@elmimmo: so you'd rule out completely the alphabetical ordering?\n~\nExample content of hpub (json hypothesis):\nAlphabetical:\n- manifest.json\n- A-cover.html\n- A-index.html\n- B-chapter-01.html\n- B-chapter-02.html\n- D-colophon.html\nToC override:\n- manifest.json\n- toc.json\n- article-dams.html\n- article-fairies.html\n- colophon.html\n- cover.html\n- index.html\nWhat do you think?\n. Exactly: with an explicit ToC file it's VERY simple to see if you're working in Alphabetical or Structured mode. Since alphabetical just \"sees\" the files, if you see a ToC, then you know it's not alphabetical.\n@Totanus: I didn't thought of that, but... Yes, that's true. JSON can be parsed easily even by the book itself!\n. For me, toc.json does an override, so if it isn't in the ToC, it doesn't appear anywhere. That for examples will allow out-of-the-flow HTML pages to be included dynamically somewhere else. It's like having a page on your website that's not linked.\nTo me, it's not an \"error to be raised\". :)\n. Is it cleaner:\nCase A:\n1. By default, the HTML files alphabetical ordering defines the page order.\n2. If toc.json is present, then it defines the pages that are going to be shown and their order.\nCase B:\n1. By default, the HTML files alphabetical ordering defines the page order.\n2. If toc.json is present, then it defines the page order.\n3. If toc.json is present and some HTML files aren't included, they are going to be added alphabetically at the end of the pages included in the toc.json file.\nI'd say A: clean, simple and understandable, instead of a mixup of things. :)\nOr, in other words: if you override, you override, not overlap. :)\n. You are just saying the same of 2, in negative. :)\n. @Bru: I don't get why those two aren't functionally equivalent. They allow to include or exclude files, in different ways. \n. Yep. :)\n. It already works and without even a spec authors are already doing that. We already have the proof for that. :)\n. I just finished preparing the 1.0 spec consolidating all the feedback so far.\nWe are going to have a manifest, as requested by many.\nWe are going to have a specified list of items, as requested by many.\nThe 1.0 spec, open for review before finalization in Baker 3.0 release, is here.\n. Thanks to Joseph Pearson for the link to this proposal by Keith Fahlgren:\nhttp://blog.threepress.org/2010/10/21/developing-an-epub-linking-spec/\nVery similar concept, a discussion will be interesting, because I was more focused on using the internet protocols to identify and locate books, using the URL as both an unique identifiers and download path location.\n(Note also that if the path location goes down, the URI will still be a unique identifier for that book, exactly like the EPub link specification).\nI still have to read in depth the proposal and the comments, but I think that we could start from that proposal and add the downloadable bit.\n. Question: any idea on how we could check if a book has been updated, without downloading it and checking the content?\n. That would require that the author is able to evaluate the md5 or that the server auto-evaluates it, a trouble in both cases. But it might be the only way, so... the main question is: where is it stored? ;)\n. Uhm yes, but I'd like a way to avoid downloading the book for checking. You know, downloading a 35Mb photo book just to see that the version hasn't changed isn't really good. :D\n. Let me see if I got it correctly. For this book book://example.com/bookname.hpub the server has:\n- http://example.com/bookname.hpub\n- http://example.com/bookname.json\nThe json file is then downloaded and the version is then matched with the version the mobile application has. If it has been updated, then it downloads the hpub file.\nI'd add: the json file is just the same manifest file inside the hpub, so the server could automatically serve that (extracting it from the hpub) or without a specific server you just have to replace the json file (so, we don't have to make another configuration file).\nSounds good. :)\n. At this moment of the discussion, toc.json and manifest.json are two different files, so there's no problem. :)\nConsider also that since it's an identifier the book version shouldn't change, unless minor fixes, so I'm against having \"http://example.com/bookname_versionXXX.hpub\", because it means that updating the book will change the URI completely. :)\nAnd of course, if the author publishes a new edition, it's going to have a whole different URL due to the - possible - structural changes (like \"Second Edition\" books).\nA way to handle versions easily without breaking the URL is for me this one, where the first one always gets the latest version (similar to the Ruby Gems model):\n1. book://example.com/bookname.hpub\n2. http://example.com/bookname.hpub?version=4\n3. http://example.com/bookname.json?version=4\n. I don't think that the usage for previous versions is so high to require creating an overly complex solution. However, we could also do that:\n- book://example.org/bookname.hpub # book identifier\n- http://example.org/bookname.json # retrieves the manifest of the latest version (and the version itself)\n- http://example.org/bookname.hpub # retrieves the latest version (as in the URI)\n- http://example.org/bookname.5.hpub # allows to retrieve a specific version\nThis solution is completely equivalent to the version based one, with the improvement that would work also on \"non dedicated\" servers (Apache) at the cost of a slightly semantic incorrectness (the version number inside the file name).\nIt probably also fits with segundoseis proposal above. :)\nCould work. :)\n. Btw, the \"book identifier\" could be also file-type agnostic:\n- book://example.org/bookname\nSo it's the reader then that checks the file it wants to use:\n- book://example.org/bookname.hpub\n- book://example.org/bookname.epub\n- book://example.org/bookname.zhook\n- book://example.org/bookname.txt\n. The first implementation of the protocol landed on GitHub master. \nNow Baker supports internal book:// URLs, downloading books.\nSo for example, if you create a link in your book like:\n- <a href=\"book://example.org/path/newbook\">Open book</a>\nIt will download this file:\n- http://example.org/path/newbook.hpub\n. Ok, it works. :)\nI'd say that this kind of support is a great first version of the protocol, so I close this issue. :)\n. Ok, I wrote some informations in a specific wiki page for easier consultation here.\n. That's true! :)\nAfter your branch is complete and merged, we should look into it. :)\n. Icons added. Some more safety testing would be advised. ;)\n. The internal linking isn't supported yet in the released version of the Framework, but we have it already ready inside the GitHub repository, so you can either download that or wait for us to release the next zip package. ;)\n. Interesting concept. I'd personally avoid next and previous, but nonetheless it could be a good approach. I'll think about it. :)\n. Wow! Do you think you are able to distribute a demo page for developers when you're done with the testing, for us to see? ;)\n. I think that's the case since that's how the book structure is built, but I think you can as well manipulate it to fit your needs. It's something I think that we'll have a lot of surprises the more people will start experimenting with it. :)\n. Wait, this isn't a code change, this is just a different book, or I got something wrong? :)\nIf that's a book as I think, you just have to put it somewhere to allow us to download it. No github or forking required. :)\n. In fact, yes. Baker would be wonderful for that.\nI'll try your book tomorrow! ;) \n. About the bug: Xcode doesn't update \"static\" files, so if you change the content of the book/ folder you have to:\n1. Clean All Targets\n2. Delete the app from inside the iPad or the Simulator (you don't have to delete manually the files in the Application folder, just delete it as a normal iOS app keeping pushed the finger/mouse on the icon).\n. But is it just the book? Could you make the book downloadable without the Framework so I can test it quickly? :)\n. I think that's already in the code, no? ;)\n. Uhm I seem to be unable to test this branch... a few orientation quirks (probably early bugs on the master you branched) and I can't open the layer...\nLet's move back to this after we merge back orientation from you and zip from Marco. ;)\n. Unfortunately not, because it's blocked by issue #8 since we don't want to force everyone to have a fixed navigation that defines in a specific way how you interact and see the book.\nOnce the issue is solved, we can start working on a overlaying UI with the navigation.\n. We are working on the issue #8, follow that one. This comes later. :)\n. I don't have an answer yet to those questions, we are now in design phase! :)\nAt this point, we'll take feedbacks, suggestions, wireframes and mockups by anyone that wants to do that, and we'll build an integrated solution. :)\nIf someone wants to sugest something, I'd just remind that the objective is to be as chrome-less as possible without impairing usability (or, in other terms, to avoid as much as possible any predefined UI).\n. I think that already does that! We filter out just file:// :D\n. Could you specify the reason? The zooming is something we removed on purpose in order to give precise control to the book creators on how it looks like. :)\n. You can, and I think you can also set a cookie to handle the size on multiple pages. But we need to try it out. :)\n. I think that the ability to save data is important for this kind of app. Maybe is it possible to use the HTML5 database?\nOtherwise I suppose we need to implement some kind of storage...\n. I think that's doable in HTML, exactly what happens in websites today, no? :)\n. Excellent. :D\nDo you mean localStorage, right? :)\n. We landed a constant in master branch to turn zoom on.\nIt's still NOT recommended, but it's there. Also it require a change in the HTML head element of each page.\nAs an author, you can. Please, use it only if you are absolutely sure. ;)\n. That's a great thing, but I'm wondering if it's within the objectives of this tool, or we should just build the \"framework\" to be included in any other kind of app.\nStill, I'd like to give some sort of basic functionality, so I'd like to hear some feedback about this topic. :)\n. I think that two different situations exist:\n- allowing to read \"any\" book (iBook)\n- allowing to create multiple numbers\nBecause those two I think that are similar technically, but very different from the point of view of UI and author. :)\n. Good point aldriq, that's truly something that we are thinking of, the point for that is the effort to reach that point, and what does it mean for the project, because then it would be a Reader with inside the Framework. Completely doable, but still decisions to take and development (a lot) to do. We'll see how the community is going to respond, step by step I think. ;)\n. Wonderful, let's see. :)\nYou're absolutely correct about the features needed in order to allow proper \"download-and-storage\" feature, since if we store something we also need to give a way to manage it (select, delete, update).\nFor that, I was thinking about a solution that involved the creation of a top navigation bar when you double tap. The bar is going to have a button \"All books\" and will allow you to tap on it and get a dropdown with all the downloaded book in the issue. From there, you can select one. If it was a downloaded book, on there it will also provide an update feature and a delete feature, even if it's not yet clear to me what's the best way to build it. As before, we probably have to create it, see how it works, and iterate a couple of times to get it right.\nBut... this doesn't mean that a HTML integration is excluded. We should still give ways from the book itself to work with book urls, but I don't expect the ability to delete/manage them, just to choose them. And for that a JS injected would be fine, let's just coordinate on the correct namespace for it. Probably creating a object called \"book\" is ideal, and we can append everything to it, so: book.shelf that returns an array of hashes: [{title, url}, {...}, ...].\nYou also got right the direction we are taking for the manifest. Again, it's more in the experimentation phase right now, so it might be that we scrap it, but we are testing something what uses a \"book.json\" file inside the hpub book, containing things like title, author, reference URL, pages and sheet options (orientation, size). I hope to be able to share something soon inside the example book that I'm re-building. :)\n. Yes, I'm imagining something similar to that UI. :)\nAbout providing view of books not downloaded yet I wasn't really thinking anything, we might leave it for a future release. I won't put too much work ahead, or we wouldn't get a good feedback from all the users. ;)\nThe one page approach you propose however should work well, and straight out of the box: if a book references another book, it should be easy to download it and add it to the Baker reader, so you could have a \"starting\" page, and then any other book will be able to trigger the download of other books. :)\nBtw, with these features it's probably possible to release a Baker Reader, so... that's something we were thinking of, but with your help it might get here sooner than expected. ;)\n. Excellent! I don't have time right now to try it out, but I'll do asap with the last master from that tree. :)\n. Tested :)\nOk, my proposal would be (sorry if I'm going to say even polish things and things you might already have planned):\n- Move the button on the right, like Mail and Dropbox\n- Use the book name instead of baker in the top bar\n- Use the book name instead of the filename in the list (this probably needs the book.json manifest)\n- Polish: fix a bit the animation in order to be coherent with the status bar\nI omitted things like delete and update, since we already talked about it. ;)\n. 1. Yep. Uh, what were you thinking then happens when you close a book? I would take a simpler approach: in the dropdown there's also the \"master\" book (the first one) so you can simply swtich back to it. (this will open the system to more flexibility in the future as well I think).\n2. Great!\n3. Yes, good point. Regarding that question, I think you detailed well the possibilities. I'd try to keep the zipped book as well, exactly for the same reasons you just explained. Then, I'd just store somewhere the manifest (or in a db) in order to use it. The only drawback is the load time for opening a book, but it's something that we could check.\n4. Maybe we can just wait the opening of the bar when the status bar is completely folded out, and then start animating in our bar. But it's just a thought, if you find a better and faster solution go for it. ;)\n. I agree with the approach, great. \nFor the filename we might think of using a hash of the URI (since that is going to be the unique identifier, like IBAN) or use a physical path that matches the URI itself (for example: book://example.org/publisher/author/book -> /books/example.org/publisher/author/book.hpub).\n. Well it depends, I think that it should be possible to keep the two things together for quite a bit, so, what feature do you think it's going to break it?\nI was trying to test your latest branch but it's giving me a few issues (NavBarController.h not found). I'd like to test it and to see what you want to add so we can coordinate.\nThat's because the Book Reader in many ways is going to be exactly Baker for a single magazine with multiple issues, with the OS-level book:// support disabled, at least thats's how we were planning it. :)\n. Ok, but I don't see at this time a breaking feature. :)\nI mean: the only difference seems that you don't want a bundled book. It's quite simple to add a flag \"if a book is present in the shelf, start with that\". That will work for either single books, multiple magazine issues, series and Reader as well. :)\nIf you just want one book, you are just going to have a button that takes you to a shelf with only one book. No big deal (and even that could be a flag).\nI agree that at some point the fork might happen, but I don't think it's now. Or am I missing something? :)\n(for the book:// protocol, it should be just off by default on OS level, to avoid overlapping features, there should be only one reader). :)\nAlso: the navigation bar is already in the master branch, are you thinking something different? :)\n. Could we get there in steps? Because maybe multiple shelves isn't going to be part of Baker Core, but everything else will. It's a hugely requested feature, it is going to be part of Baker Core. :)\nAfter that, I think that a proper forking will be a good choice. :)\n. Great. :)\nDo you already have something in mind? Or are you starting with a plain shelf? I'm asking because I've already started working on the design of that part, and I'd like to avoid duplicated efforts. ;)\n. Great. :)\nDo you already have something in mind? Or are you starting with a plain shelf? I'm asking because I've already started working on the design of that part, and I'd like to avoid duplicated efforts. ;)\n. I'd just suggest in any case to disable the book:// url catching until we have a bigger discussion about it, I'd avoid to release frameworks then are going to compete on which one is going to download books - and maybe you don't want to download any kind of book in your branded app, you know ;)\nBut that's critical instead to create a reader, so worth working with that, it just needs to be off by default. :)\n. Yep, we did the same, I just wanted to avoid situation of apps published on the store from the evolved framework that then are going to catch all the books from everywhere. :)\n. Hi! :D\nEven if it isn't a \"good\" news, thanks for the update! :)\nWe are going to tackle it in the 4.0 release, so we are going to have a look at your work by then, and see if we can borrow idea. 4.0 will be probably also a refactored version, so... we'll rewrite a lot of it as well. :)\nThank you very much, and I hope you'll still find a few minutes every now and then to chime in. :)\n. Thanks! That's a very nice link. Did you try to contact him to see if he wants to try an integration with Baker? ;)\n. Hi Carlo! :)\nAt the beginning more than a year ago (wow, thinking about it) we didn't have in mind to expand the framework to such a level, so the code isn't much modular.\nIt would be great to have a structure like the one you defined, but it's probably related to the refactoring tracked in Issue #59 that still hasn't been done.\nIf you want to contribute to Baker, the best idea would be probably for you to have a look at the code base and suggest here an approach that could be doable in your perspective. We're open to discuss any option. :)\nA cool approach could be for you to work on a branch from the upcoming 3.1 release and incorporate in your shelf, discussing and feeding then back the result. But, I think, this could be quite a big undertaking, so I can't really ask you to do it. :)\nCheck the code and let's see what you think you could do. :)\nThanks! :)\n. Thanks to you! Please keep us informed on your thoughts and progress. :)\n. No worries, and thank you in advance for any contribution you'd like to make. :D\n. @nin9creative the last time we checked, it wasn't integrating with Baker, but it might have changed. Worth testing. :)\n. @nin9creative Thanks for the question, I'll take it as an occasion to clarify a few points. :)\nWhere are we now\nFirst of all: this very issue where you are discussing is the very place where we are collecting feedback and where we'll post updated about the development. So far, we did a lot of discovery, but since we are still fixing bugs and adding features for the 3.1, no code has been written yet.\nBaker will support a shelf, and as you can see at the top of this page it's scheduled to be Baker 4.0. We are still not sure on the specific implementation however, and that's why we are both looking into different solutions and following this topic as well to see the different opinions of the people working on it.\nWe are looking for a solution both flexible and without administrative debris as much as possible.\n(see Tufte for a definition of administrative debris: http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00036T).\nNow, there are of course two different things here that are possible:\n1. We abstract Baker as a class \u2014 currently, for historic reasons, it's an app not easily pluggable (it's tracked by Issue #59)\n2. We include in Baker a shelf as flexible as possible (it's tracked by this issue).\nBoth the solutions are valid, and in the end we'd love to do both. Right now however, we see more feasible doing the second one, because the first one will require a complete code refactoring. However, no decision is final, as of today, and we'll keep following this thread. :)\nPlus, it's an opensource project, so someone might fork Baker and implement one of the two points above and feed it back to us... ;)\n. As for the placement of the button, the ideal position that we tested as working well is to add a black bar on top when you double tap: in that way the full magazine/book experience will still be there, while at the same time you have access to the full shelf. :)\nSee this mockup I prepared for the shelf work:\nhttp://cl.ly/2l0k3M0c04320x1e2e3l\nIn the design:\n- The bar is full black\n- The title of the book is Helvetica Light. :)\n- The button is basically a flat, dark gray version of the standard button\nI hope this helps. ;)\n. Just one question that just popped into my mind: what's the license of the library developed by siteless? Does someone know? I checked the website but I wasn't able to find anything specific.\nThe best thing would be to be BSD, aligned with Baker itself, to allow commercial reuse and implementations. :)\n. Then we have to ask to be sure. :)\n. The extent of customizability is something we can have after everything is in place and working, so let's reach that stage first. :)\nAs the Baker team, we were thinking of creating a Shell in full HTML with specific hooks and server-side downloads, but of course now that you are developing an alternative we'll check that out first. :)\nThe problem with native interfaces is exactly the extent of the customizability that's possible with a reasonable effort, so we can't look into that without first having it working fully and reliably.\nSo, please open a new Issue related to this one about that, we'll tacked it after this one. :)\n. One point that probably we should discuss instead here is: what will open at the first execution?\n1. First execution opens the latest magazine\n2. First execution opens the shelf\nBoth options have pros and cons, and at this point we are leaning toward opening the magazine first, because that's what the user expect, but I'd like to hear your opinion too. :)\n. @nin9creative Thanks. :)\n@mutador As far as I know, you can choose where to host your files. :)\n. Inkling is a great application, both as a product and for the user experience and interface solutions it adopts. :)\n. What do you mean? :)\n. Well, the Shelf - this issue - is just a way to visualize multiple issue, nothing else. Or, in your words: storing.\nFor updating you can already use the book:// protocol, and it's quite a flexible standard. :)\nFor purchasing, I don't think right now that Baker will support any specific solution. \nSo, I think that we are perfectly aligned. :)\n. Yes, of course. Just mind that:\n1. The shelf is not ready yet, so any \"update\" will remove the previous book\n2. You shouldn't use \"book\" as the protocol, that should be reserved for a generic reader application. Use a solution like Facebook (\"fb87930283904://\"), creating a long alphanumeric protocol identifier that's unique to your service and plug that in your iOS app.\n. Ok, I'll comment there. :)\n. Did you try profile it? Because we constantly run the app with Instruments and so far wa aren't seeing any clear leak. Could you check what's causing the leak for you?\n. Uhm ok, but that's a restructuring you did. Baker - up until now - was never meant to be used in that way, so it's surely missing code to work as a standalone UIView class. You'll have to add it yourself.\n. Hi @nin9creative! \nHow is the shelf fork going?\n. Wow. Thanks for the update. :)\nI'm asking because if we don't find any issue tomorrow we should be able to release version 3.2 and as such we'll move to version 4.0... shelf by next week. :)\n. That's really impressive. :)\nWe can't wait to see your contribution. :D\n. As far as I know it's not complete - but I would be very happy to be proven wrong. \nYou should probably try to contact him directly. :)\n. @medaura You can't bypass Apple. The discussion above was about how to trigger downloads from the web to be handled by a Baker application (and that's done by creating a \"dedicated\" HTTP protocol). For either subscription or in-app purchases you can do just two things:\n1. Use the Apple-provided mechanisms (in-app or subscription).\n2. Create a free app that is still useful, and without any link in the app, provide a way to buy from your website.\nThe second choice is very risky, consider that's part of a long-going fight between Apple and some publishers and it will damage your sales.\n~\n@nurtext @Bobramyl The point about open source is surely clear and it's surely not dependent of where you live, however we aren't using the GPL license, but the BSD one. BSD doesn't force any release of the code in the open, it's up to the goodwill and choice of the developers that take Baker's open code and build upon it.\nWe always advise to release in the open, because \u2014 big or small companies \u2014 there's no harm related to it. :)\n. I'm saying it's technically possible with Baker, but I think Apple will block you out. They did that with big companies, I don't think they will allow you. :)\n. Unfortunately that's not an example (and as far as I know it's not from Laker's author). They built everything in HTML5, they don't publish on the store. So, they don't use anything like Baker (and the speed is very affected).\n. If it's fully HTML5, you can do whatever you want, yes. :)\n. We are almost done with the code refactoring and modularization, leading us next with the Shelf. :)\nAs you can see from Issue #59 we have merged back to MASTER the first iteration of the modular version of Baker (now BakerViewController and not anymore RootViewController), allowing a greater extent of reusability and implementation in new projects.\nPlease see Issue #59 and help us to check for bugs so we can safely then work on the Shelf/Multi-issue itself for our next milestone, version 4.0. :)\n. We tried, but it seems there's not way to remove it while keeping the same interactions due to the fact that UIWebView \"eats\" the events.\nIt's still there, we managed to make it lighter and self-contained tho. :)\nThe idea is that now you can just initialize it as a class, and it works. :)\n. Given the results from the refactoring, we now started working on the shelf. We studied all the different approaches that have been done or tried up until now and while each of them is too far away from the core of functionalities of Baker to be merged easily on our side, we learned quite a lot from each approach, the various problems (appearing in the threads, commits and emails) and that allowed us to have a speed start on it. :)\nSo, thank you all for your efforts!\nWhere are we? Well, this is the very beginning and you can follow the branch shelf to be updated on that. It's still NOT WORKING, so be aware that until it gets merged in MASTER it can explode, turn off the lights, burn your bacon and steal your cookies:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/tree/shelf\nUse this only to track the progress and - if you want - coordinate with us to provide patches and updates. Please avoid also to filing bugs until we can actively look for them. ;)\nWe'll update this thread. :)\n. We studied the code quite a bit, actually it has been very useful and helped us a lot.\nWe were very sad but we had to decide against starting from that one because:\n1. The last merge of the features was done on the 10th of December given the git log, so there are loads of commits, features and fixes missing.\n2. You added a lots of features and we aren't quite able to determine which one is where and which can be merged back and which is instead customized for your personal needs.\n3. We never got the message that it was complete, nor a push request of features or patches... but it might be that we missed that. We can't merge back features that aren't \"complete\" because then we will have to figure out why ourselves from code that for us is unknown.\nSo... we'll be happy to accept contributions if you are able to split them out in specific features updated on the current codebase... otherwise we'll keep checking the code to see your decision and choices and see what we can learn from your progress. :)\n. So... for the weekly progress update: there are still a few details to sort out, but the current shelf branch now supports multiple books present already in-app (if a folder is present in the books folder, it will be read as multiple issues).\nIt's still completely local (no support for download and probably some related bug), but the read-open-close part should work.\n. Thanks! :)\nA little update: now the current shelf branch supports multi-book locally and the shelf + toolbar is skinnable (three images are there for this reason to be customized). This part is already in place and working: just drop multiple books in the books/ folder and Baker picks them up.\nIt's still missing the download feature (and as such, the book:// protocol is currently broken) and a list of other smaller issues here and there to be fixed (no special support when just one issue is present, some visual issues when transitioning, titles to be added, ...).\n. @mpena2099 for us it would be great to incorporate your shelf even if now we started developing our own. The most important thing however is that you should first integrate the current master changes in your branch to avoid repeating bugs that were already fixed (your latest update from us was on the 10th of December last year), make sure that everything works on Baker as before (a few weeks ago we tested it and we noticed some differences in the touch events on the books) and then we can see what is the best way to merge.\nWe can't accept it as a whole if it's not on feature parity with the core Baker, you can understand. :)\nOn the other side, we might also bring in just some specific parts: for example, right now we have the shelf up but not the remote download and we will have to implement two different classes probably for users that want to use Newsstand and users that want to have the app as a standard app. It would be AMAZING if you could extract the code that handles Newsstand downloads so we can plug it in. :)\n. ...just that the code is already a fork on GitHub, see the link above. ;)\nIf you see the network (link in the menu at the top), you'll notice - other than Baker and a few others - the excellent collaboration on @nin9creative's tree and @mpena2099 pushing to it. :)\n. Tonight we broke down the remaining steps for us to proceed with the shelf.\nWe split in two: first getting the shelf working with local issues, then getting it working with remote issues (NewsstandKit).\nCHECKLIST CONSOLIDATE:\n~~1. Add: The book should derive the folders from the path it was initialized from~~\n~~2. Add: Write the book status when the book is closed~~\n~~3. Fix: Animation glitch when opening a book from the shelf: show the bar on top open, then close it~~\n~~4. Fix: Check the screenshot glitch~~\n~~5. Add: Book \"cover\" viewed as thumbnail on the shelf~~\n~~6. Add: switch on SHELF if there's only one book, open directly (take out ShelfManager)~~\n~~7. Chore: Cleanup (downloader, sha, \u2026)~~\nCHECKLIST SHELF:\nA. Add: preprocessor code to switch NK on\nB. Add [NK]: download list of issues from server, visualize list on shelf, save locally\nC. Add [NK]: download button, download issue from shelf\nD. Add [NK]: delete issue\n. Uhm no nothing changed on the Hpub standard, so it's likely a bug of some kind.\nThank you very much for the detailed report, it helps a lot. :)\n. Btw, we are almost there with the shelf branch. Have a look and test it if you can, so we can find problems like the one above (thanks again). :)\n. To use Newsstand features you need to be in Newsstand, but in-app purchase is a different thing and will not be included in 4.0 (unless there's a blocker we aren't aware of). If you know differently please link us a resource so we can review it. :)\nTo explain our thinking better:\n1. We are trying to have a 4.0 that will support either standalone apps without download (containing multiple books from the start) or Newsstand apps with download (with background download, remote server and remote updates).\n2. This works for free publications. If you need to sell them you have to implement in-app purchase yourself, it will not be part of Baker 4.0.\n. That's correct. :)\n. Ok, we can close this issue now:\n1. Baker in the branch shelf manages multiple books.\n2. Baker in the branch shelf has a shelf to visualize them.\nWe are closing this issue also because it's getting too big and the discussion is a bit too wide. This issue was quite narrow in scope originally (referring just multiple books and shelf, bundled inside the app) while the rest was split in other issues.\nSo, to follow the progress from here, the other two issues are:\n1. Issue #100, where we track the implementation of Newsstand.\n2. Issue #519, where we track the implementation of the iPhone shelf (right now it's iPad only).\nPlus of course the whole Milestone 4.0: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues?milestone=8&state=open\nThis means that the branch shelf is still in development, so if you can help testing it, it would be great! :+1: \n\u2014\nSo, how Baker handles a shelf without a full Newsstand implementation right now? It's easy: as it used to work before, it bundles the book inside the app. It's not a great solution for everyone, we understand, but it's a request we received a few times and so there it is.\nWe explain the two modes in this wiki page: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-vs-Bundled-publications-support-in-Baker-4.0\n\u2014\nThanks everyone for the support, it has been a great discussion. :)\n. Before proceeding, a question: are we sure that embedding a Google Map inside a book is something we want to do? :)\nBecause that means that the \"book\" works only online, and I think it would create a quite bad experience for a user.\nThat said, I think it's still interesting to see why it happens - I think it's something related to the managing of the URL schemes.\n. Did you use the ZIP from the website or the current development HEAD from github?\n. Ok, I think that the problem with maps appears only on the head version due to some changes in the way we intercept events to allow linking and other interesting stuffs. :)\n. The problems should be solved in the current master and in the 1.1. ;)\n. Yes, using the next page colour is probably the best solution, but as you've guessed it's also quite hard to get. :)\nConsider also that I'd like to have the next and previous page pre-loaded, today it isn't possible due to memory limits of the iPad, but maybe in the future it's going to be possible (next year?).\nIf we can think of a simple - and efficient - way to do that it would be great. :)\n. Indeed.\nBut I think that:\n1. The standard should be universal, not device or implementation dependent (like a \"background color for the next page on the iPad\"\n2. We should aim for a incredibly simple 1.0 version for the HPub standard.\nSo I'd try to avoid overloading the meta file with configuration bits. :)\nWhat do you think?\n. Yes, I agree on that. We'll probably go on with this discussion then when we choose a way to handle metadata in HPub. ;)\n. That's a great idea. :) Thanks for the tip.\n. It seems we forgot to answer properly to this issue. :)\nSo, the code to do this is in the 2.0 release of Baker, you can edit it in the header of RootViewController.m:\n// LOADER STYLE\n// Configure this to change the color of the loader\ndefine SCROLLVIEW_BGCOLOR whiteColor\ndefine PAGE_NUMBERS_COLOR blackColor\ndefine PAGE_NUMBERS_ALPHA 0.2\n. Yup, same issue here. Confirmed. :)\n. svdgraaf's branch needs surely to be included in the master, but I still have the problems I've cited in the other issue. We can't stop working on all the other features until it gets merged unfortunately.\n. There's not set up way to do that as of today. You have to code that part yourself. However, if your page takes a long time, I'd advise to not remove the loader, or to replace it with something similar to tell the user that the page is still loading.\n. This isn't a bug or feature req, closing.\n. Unfortunately that's a technical limitation that we're trying to solve since day one. We're working hard on that, but so far no solution.\nThanks for the pointer however, because it's important to know that nags people. :/\n. We spent days on this, unfortunately we don't have a solution yet. :|\n~\nTo answer your question, the previous version of Baker used a three-panes approach, but we left it behind because it wasn't feasible with the current iPad hardware (not enough memory) if you started building pages more complex than a few scrolls of text).\nWe are still trying to solve this, thanks for the feedback and... well if it happens, help us asking around on how to fix this. ;)\n. Yep, javascript works fine. :)\nIf you find a way to buffer them, we'll add the change as soon as we can. :)\n. @fourthversion\nWould you like to make a patch or merge request so we can credit you in the code? :)\n. If you think a better solution exists, then definitely go for it. We are quite stuck now because it seems something related with the internals of UIWebView, and so it's probably some kind of hack over it. :)\nMy \"ownership\" on the framework is just about trying to create something that's satisfying as the \"ideal\" book solution, but to go there me and the other developers surely need a lot of help. :)\nI think we'll still test and try to include the quick solution in the 1.1 as an interim solution. ;)\n. We added the solution to the current master, it's going to be in the 1.1. I won't close this bug since I'd gladly avoid the 0.1 delay it generates, but I think it's better this way for now. :)\n. As I've said above, the original Baker used three panes with pre-loaded content. It was already ready, already built. It was our first approach, if you check the codebase before the release date. But... it hit a few walls:\n1. The bug we are discussing here was still present\n2. While pre-loading, the interface was basically locked\n3. With bigger pages there wasn't enough memory, so it still flashed white and loaded\nWe have changed a bit the code in these months and we are surely a bit more expert, so we might try again re-implementing it and see if we are able to workaround those issues, but these are the reasons why we reverted back to a single page view: the experience was awful.\n. It's already included in Baker 1.1, released a few days ago. ;)\nThe bug is not closed because I'd try to find a better solution.\n. The workaround is the one already released, sorry. :|\n. That's basically the reason why we removed it past november. It usually works when the pages aren't huge, but as you can see the problem appears quite quickly.\nWhat do you mean by preloading the black page? :)\n. That could be an interesting idea to test, I'm not sure however if it's slower to do the reflow, or reload the pages.\n. Ok, I got it. Yes, I guess that's a good way then. :)\n. Which one you are referring to? It seems that only \"Advanced Book App\" does that, and it's still very basic content with basic animations and features. I might have missed the one you were referring to, tho. :)\n. Yup, it's absolutely possible in pure HTML/JS. The idea is that if you prefer a pure JavaScript solution you can still use Baker for it, and adapt it your way.\nWe have an ongoing discussion about it, however for now we think that the current Baker + Laker approach is still the good one, we don't wont to force any specific HTML to book creators, like nobody would try to force any CSS or JavaScript framework for the web.\nWhat I could suggest is to create your \"packaged\" solution, we'll list it in the public Baker website like we are doing with Laker, in order to have a more rich ecosystem.\nAnd in the future, we'll see... maybe we'll start incorporating some JavaScript as well. :)\n. I prefer that too. ;)\nWhat do you mean by shifted? :)\n. I can't think of a clean enough way to do that, would you like to try to implement it in a way that doesn't change the page building process for authors? :)\n. Quickly:\n1. We don't want to impose templates. If someone wants to build a template to make everything faster, we will be glad to support it in addition to Baker, but Baker should allow complete freedom in managin the HTML. That's why I was suggesting to developer it and see any possible integration with Laker. Consider also that iPads are going to be faster year after year. ;)\n2. You have removed it on trunk or on the three-cards branch? And did you try every action possible? Because it was introduced to avoid bad issues in some loads, but in the three-cards branch it might not be needed anymore.\n3. That will depend on a template, however... and the template will already know when the HTML has completed loading. ;)\n4. Well we are already doing all the caching possible - that's basically what the three-cards is. :)\n. Ok!\n1. We are checking the delay\n2. We are checking the random bug you found\n3. The flash of content: it existed since 1.0, unfortunately it seems related to a UIWebView bug under certain circumstances. We hope it's going to be fixed under iOS 5.\n4. We are already switching to black. It seemed a huge request. :)\n5. The navigator wasn't there because it was a different branch, now everything has been merged to master, both three cards and navigator. :)\n6. What did it disable? Did you try the last master? :)\n. Well, that's something tha @Xm4s proposed too.\nWe never tried, so I might be wrong, but there are a few things to consider:\n1. When? We can't ask the users to build an image for every page, and it might be a huge performance it on caching.\n2. The interaction: if the user will se the image he will expect to interact with it too: so he swipes, starts scrolling and... nothing happens.\n. From an experience point of view I'm dubious on the reception of a normal user of such a loading, I'm worried that it might have a low cost/benefit ratio, considering that iOS will get more and more optimized and hardware is going to be better and better.\nBut as said, it might be worth a try.\nI'm also thinking of trying a JS/HTML approach as suggested my Mimetic and others, in order to keep the HPub format as-is, while maybe getting better result on swipes.\n. Yes, they do. It's a kind of a mixture of high-res images and XML to describe the interaction that you can have there. Think of it as images with overlaid a map of touchable parts. They can optimize a lot out of it due to the small number of possible things you can do there.\n. It was the Feature #17 closed at the end of last month, borrowed and enhanced from Laker. ;)\n. That's great! :)\nLet's see, maybe we can optimize it to work better than the native solution. ;)\n. The \"scrollView.pagingEnabled = YES\" command however will disable paging at all, so you won't have any more the automatically centered pagination. :)\nAbout mantaining the pages... well it depends a lot on what you are doing. ;)\nHowever, we'll test again, and please post here any new version that you are going to have, or even better maybe create a new Issue called JavaScript Pagination or something like that, so we can test out that road in a more precise way. :)\n. Ha sorry, it's the exact opposite. Nevermind. ;)\nThere are published around some very fast javascript scrolling solutions for iPad, overriding the native scrolling, you might want to have a look at these. ;)\nWell yes, if you are building a photobook, well, a horizontal photobook then it's probably not the perfect choice. However, did you try simpli having a wide page? :)\n. Ok, Xmas completed this monumental task.\nWe have:\n1. Three-cards support\n2. Screenshot cache support (thanks to the PugPig team for the idea)\nBy default, we are using \"Screenshot\" modality, because it's cleaner, doesn't cause problems with preloaded pages that execute code on-load and uses less memory.\nBut of course, if you need it you can enable three-cards as well that we saw works well in some situations (including a published book), using this flag:\ndefine ENABLE_THREE_CARD NO\nWe also tested it, and feels stable. But of course please test as much as possible before the 3.0 release! :D\n. The simplest way is to click on \"Source\" above, then \"Download\" and pick the last master. Otherwise you can use git following the instructions on how to use it on this website. :)\n. Does this help maybe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/215252/uuid-mismatch-detected-with-the-loaded-library ?\n. You're welcome! :)\n. Could you please open a separate issue so we can track it accordingly? ;)\n. It might be related to the way we intercept the events...\nDo you have an example page to provide with an embedded map that have those problems?\n. I think it's something we are trying to figure out, since there are a lot of overlapping events. Any help is welcome. ;)\n. Wow nice workaround! :)\nEven if I think it's not something that would work on Google Maps, right?\n. Hehheheh yes, I think that it's unavoidable. :)\nThanks for the feedback. :)\n. Yup, as you've seen there's already the issue #17 open about that. ;)\n. What exactly do you mean for \"magazine-like\" view? :)\nHowever those events are handler by the native components we are using, UIWebView a UIScrollBar, so you need to intercept them before they gets \"absorbed\" by them. :P\n. Unfortunately that's one of the problem we are already trying to solve with the InterceptorWindow, even if for other needs. :)\n~\nNote: Baker before release was already 3-cards-view, but we had to drop it because it was too slow on the current hardware. Maybe it behaves better if your pages are smaller, but be aware of it! :)\nOr maybe... did you find a way to optimize it? :)\n. I think I could close this as solved, ping me if I'm wrong. ;)\n. Could you try to detail a little more how it could work?\nBecause I can't think right now of an easy way of doing that.\nDo you also have an example? Because from your explanation I'm imagining a \"spread\" with two pages really cramped trying to fit 768px inside two 512px columns and I don't understand the need for \"spread\" that couldn't just be solved developing your book horizontally. :)\nThanks!\n. Don't you know any currently released iPad app that does that? Because from the video it looks like just a change of the CSS keeping the same content, I'd like to see how it works to get it correctly. :)\n. From all the videos you linked, and from the tutorials and docs of the Adobe platform, it seems that they don't merge pages to create spreads. :)\nI've scouted around a bit, because it felt a bit strange from a cognitive point of view, and I found:\nhttp://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/digitalpublishing/digitalpublishing_userguide.pdf\nOn page 21 it says:\n\n\"You cannot mix single-orientation and dual-orientation stacks in an issue.\"\n\nThat means also that you must have also exactly the same number of pages. In fact, Adobe works in stacks (articles), and if you see, Vanity Fair's magazine when you move in spread view doesn't change the number of page - no merged spreads - but adds an advertisement on the side.\nI've tested also a few other apps developed on the Adobe platform and the page count is always the same regardless of orientation.\nIf I may suggest the reason, that's quite understandable: I could infer that if while browsing a digital magazine it changes the page numbers \"live\" when I turn the iPad, then I would be confused, because the working unit is a single article (stack in Adobe's dictionary) and so I wouldn't know anymore where the article is.\nSo, I'd say that the best solution using Baker is just keeping all the content in the same HTML, and using CSS to show/hide/rearrange elements on the page when the user change the orientation. :)\n. There's another location to ask for support: email. :)\nSee at the bottom of the website: info AT bakerframework DOT com\n~\nThe solution you are looking for is already in our master GitHub branch, it's just not released yet on the website's zip file. :)\nDownload the current master from here: https://github.com/Simbul/baker (top-right corner, \"Downloads\") until we release the next official framework. :)\n. I agree, but for now the load is high but not so high and the questions are mostly bugs or feature request. :)\nWe'll surely think of a better way of communicating if this project gets more success. ;)\n. Our plan is to use the current WebKit engine, so for now I don't think we are going to re-implement it. However, are you sure you can't do that even today with a little of javascript attached to the ready event of the page?\n. If you need a background audio I think you can just add that in Objective-C and control it maybe through javascript calls. Unfortunately there's nothing \"native\" in HTML that persists through different pages.\n. I think we can mark this as closed, tho. :)\n. Before diving into it, there's some reason why you can't use the standard CSS3 font-face directive?\nhttp://www.css3.info/preview/web-fonts-with-font-face/\n. No worries! Have fun! ;)\n. ...and what happens on the device? :)\nHowever without the code you're using it's hard to guess what your problem could be. :)\n. Could you point out where? We don't add any delay, just the time needed for the page to scroll: the page loading is delayed exactly by the time it takes to scroll.\nIf we fire the two events at the same time the scroll will stutter, creating an even more unpleasant effect (in the worst scenario, it doesn't even show the scroll animation, it just replaces the page after a blank screen).\n. I'll mark this as duplicate of issue #27\n. Thanks! :)\n. Excellent. Would you care to write a tutorial? Maybe link it here as well? :)\n. Ok, I'll close the issue. :)\n. In fact, it's not supported. :)\nWhy do you need that? :)\n. It's not a ban. It's both a choice and a technical limitation.\nFor the complete reason, check the hPub topic #13, where the future implementation of the format has the answer to your problem. ;)\nThe brief answer is: it's going to be possible whent the manifest file is going to be implemented, it's not going to be possible with the automatic ordering because to do that we would be less flexible, disallowing basically the possibility of not including files, an actual requirement to be more flexible and allow some kind of in-page dynamics with javascript. :)\n. You can't make the vertical scrollbar always visible (but you can build your own scrollbar class if you want to) and you can turn on the zoom, but it's not recommended because it makes the page creation process more complex (the easiest way needs you to add specific tags in every HTML page) and it creates a less immersive reading (use JavaScript on specific items if you need to zoom).\nHowever, this is mostly a iOS SDK question, not a Baker question. ;)\n. With the 1.0 you could just go on the next/previous page when tapping on the side, now it detects multiple taps and jumps multiple pages accordingly. :)\n. Instead of separating the screen in areas for swipe, touch, etc, now we recognise swipes independently from where you do them. :)\n. Baker 1.0 didn't support orientation switch, I don't know how it could have worked for you. :)\nWe are working on the rotation right now, it should be in the next release. See issue #6. :)\n. No, the next release is the one coming after the 1.1. :)\n. Uncommenting commented code couldn't make things work. If it's commented there's a reason: there's no page cache. ;)\nSee issue #27 and all the comments there.\n. Hello and thanks! ;)\n1. Baker 1.0 or 1.1?\n2. In the title you say \"crash\", does the app crash?\n3. When it happens, it's just once, or from that moment on is broken even on taps?\n4. Could you provide a simple, barebones, html page that breaks it and the steps to reproduce it?\n5. If not, could you film yourself doing that, explaining the problem at the same time?\nThis might help. ;)\n. Zooming and pinching is possible, see on RootViewController.m:\n#define PAGE_ZOOM_GESTURE NO\nHowever, please try to avoid it and use javascript instead to make zoomable only the parts you really need to, because zooming and pinching interfere with the \"book\" interaction model. It also makes the creation of a book way more complex.\n. These are more iOS SDK questions: you'll probably find better answers on a iPhone development forum or Stackoverflow. ;)\n. That's exactly what I was referring before with \"It also makes the creation of a book way more complex.\" :D\nTry adding the HTML/iPhone headers with a set zoom in the header, it might help. :)\n. You are having problem because it's a leftover from the first Baker implementation before 1.0 release. It's not supported but to the inability to the current iPad hardware to handle it correctly. :)\nYou might try to reimplement it if you have small pages with not much content, but start from scratch, any leftover in the code isn't working anymore.\n. You have to dig inside the code and remove it by hand, however I advise you to not do that, since you're removing an important feedback for your readers.\n. The loading is there exactly because we can't avoid it. See #27\n. Are you referring to this issue? -> #6\nHowever turning the page changes it size, so if you want that you are going to need a new CSS for horizontal viewing. :)\n. A brief explanation: it isn't supported due to hardware and libraries limitations.\nPlease read issue #27 for more details. ;)\n. We were waiting to land three-cards, manifest and navigation before refactoring, but yes, the approach you described is going in the right direction. ;)\n. Just a quick update. This task has started, you can see the progress on the refactor-to-reader branch. Please be aware that things might break in that branch until it gets merged into the main branch. :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/tree/refactor-to-reader\n. This evening we:\n- Renamed RootViewController to BakerViewController... finally!\n- \"Packaged\" all the Baker files inside a nice Baker subfolder\n- Prepared a quick tutorial to include the Baker module, following.\n. HOWTO\n1. In Xcode, Create a new iOS project, for example Application --> Empty Application.\n2. In the next window make sure that \"Use Automatic Reference Counting\" is unchecked.\n3. Select the root of the project in the project navigator, select the target in the main window, scroll down to \"Linked Frameworks and Libraries\" and add MessageUI.framework.\n4. In the same frameworks panel add libz.dylib.\n5. From the menu select File --> \"Add files to \".\n6. Locate and select the Baker subfolder inside the Baker project.\n7. Select \"Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)\", \"Create groups for any added folders\" and \"Add to targets\" to your desired target.\n8. Open the AppDelegate.h file.\n9. In AppDelegate.h at the top of the file in the #import part add:\n@class BakerViewController\n10. In AppDelegate.h after the @interface block add:\n```\n@property (strong, nonatomic) BakerViewController *rootViewController;\n```\n\n\nOpen the AppDelegate.m file.\n\nIn AppDelegate.m at the top of the file in the #import part add:\n```\nimport \"BakerViewController.h\"\nimport \"InterceptorWindow.h\"\n``\n13. Just below@implementationadd the@synthesize` command:\n@synthesize rootViewController;\n14. Inside the function dealloc before the line [super dealloc]; add:\n[rootViewController release];\n15. Inside the function application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions comment or delete the line starting with self.window.\n16. Just below that line add: \nself.window = [[[InterceptorWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] autorelease];\nself.rootViewController = [[[BakerViewController alloc] initWithBookPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"book\" ofType:nil]] autorelease];\n[self.window addSubview:rootViewController.view];\n17. Put your unzipped Hpub book files inside a folder named book\n18. From the menu select File --> \"Add files to \".\n19. Locate your newly created book folder.\n20. Select \"Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)\", \"Create folder references for any added folders\" and \"Add to targets\" to your desired target.\n21. (this tutorial misses the storage of the last page and scroll position)\n. Still open:\n- We still have to check the book:// protocol behaviour (in AppDelegate) \n- Book download is still not working\n- Create new and clean Baker app from a new Xcode project template\n. Still with some issue pending we did the merge in MASTER. We are almost there. :)\n. Hpub IS HTML5. What do you think the difference is? What are you missing? :)\n. Exactly. It's HTML5 zipped. As simple as that. :)\n. That's even more Adobe's price, around 7000\u00a3 (even if it's per year and not the whole source). It also looks like that is more for text ebooks, and not for fully designed books like Baker. :)\n\n\nDid you try it? :)\n. Ok, but the two examples books I've seen don't seem to be able to achieve the same HTML/CSS level Baker does. It seems breaking the content in multiple pages and so on. With content manipulation it's possible to make, for example, the transition smoother. But it's not possible when you build something like Baker exactly like Baker does. :)\nTo summarize:\n- Point 1, is possible at the cost of having something different as far as I know. I may be wrong, but I have to see the code, from the apps it seems that is happening what I'm saying above.\n- Points 2 + 4 are in our plan as you can see from the issue tracker and from the contribution of other developers.\n- Point 3 is already possible, it's just not out of the box, we don't want to endorse at this point any specific platform.\n- Points 5 + 6 are already possible. :)\nIs there anywhere I can download the encrypted version to test it?\n. Ok, I just contacted him. :)\n. No answer so far for me.\n. It might be worth testing. :)\nThe only thing that I think it could be a blocker is that it seems well tied in into the OS X Help structure, so it might require to conform to the help books format, since there are things in the doc like \"For a help book to be searchable, it must have an index file. You can create index files using the Help Indexer utility, described in \u201cIndexing Your Help Book.\u201d\", something that we can't do, and looks like only for Mac OS X, not iOS. :)\n. Thanks, that's an excellent tutorial. :)\nUnfortunately the hard part isn't searching inside a UIWebView document, but looking inside all the documents within a specific book... because these aren't loaded in a UIWebView... :|\n. To be precise, our work on this issue didn't start yet, there were just some contributions from the community but we didn't receive anything workable up until now; #369 was closed because it was a duplicate of this one and well... #61 is this issue. :)\nIf someone wants to pick up this feature request and implement it, we'd be glad to coordinate. :)\n. Interesting, yesterday they just approved our 5x15 app updated to 1.1... however the rotation is something we are adding in the current master, check it out. ;)\n. It was the issue #6, now completed and closed. It's already in the master branch and will be the next version of Baker. :)\n. It was the issue #6, now completed and closed. It's already in the master branch and will be the next version of Baker. :)\n. This is indeed a bug, we'll check! ;)\n. We did some additional tests:\n1. Links from a page of the book to a page of the book with anchor, goes there correctly.\n2. Links from a page inside an iframe to a page of the book with anchor, goes there correctly.\n3. Links from a page of the book to a page outside the book with an anchor, goes there correctly.\n4. Links from a page outside of the book (opened like point 3 above for example) to the page previously there, goes there correctly.\n5. Links from a page outside of the book (opened like point 3 above for example) to a different page inside the book, goes there correctly.\nWe have enabled the items 3, 4, 5 above with the recent commit to try address the issues you noted. :)\nI think that should cover all the basic anchor situations. :)\n. We already have that: the roadmap is this very issue tracker, the order of the items defines the implementation priority (and order) and we use votes, comments and feedbacks to prioritize them. :)\nThe framework is built to allow you to build a book entirely in HTML/JS/CSS, so that's the overall objective of the project. Anything more than a \"book\" is Obj-C. :)\nWe should probably work also on a wiki, or many tutorials, but at this point I think it would be way better if people that work with Baker write about these contents on their blogs and we'll eventually link back. :)\nIf you want to take that role, you can start writing tutorials and help people that need it. :)\n. Uhm it's strange because there's no conversion done by Baker, and at the same time it shouldn't zoom. Could you give us a link of an example book that has that problem?\n. Yep, that's the expected behaviour: the sorting is alphabetical, and alphabetically 11 follows 1, and 2 follows 13. If you want to have the correct ordering, check the suggestions in the readme file (or the example included in the provided book): 01.html, 02.html, 03.html, or proper names: Chapter01.html, Chapter02.html, etc. :)\n. Hello! Could you detail a little more your problem? :)\n. I mark this as closed then. ;)\n. I'll say that this is closed, the issue #83 updates this one. ;)\n. You can use Baker as the reader part of an app that does exactly that, but at this time it's not available \"out of the box\". :)\n. Well, the download works from one book to another, but it doesn't store the book itself. :)\n. I think it's going to be quite a trouble: that's all manager by native iOS controls, UIScrollView and UIWebView and it doesn't seem if you can override these behaviours.\nThat said, we even never tried... so there might be a way. We'll look into it... and if you can please try checking it out yourself. ;)\nThanks!\n. I'll close this since it seems unsolvable right now, we'll see in the future if Apple will update the components what happens. :)\n. Hi Fenix, did the suggestion work out in the end? :)\n. We are closing this, if the problem is still there please comment with more details. :)\n. Uhm could you explain it better? Baker Framework is designed to build App Store applications, not \"books\" for the iBook Store.\n. Probably you created a book that is text only, the kind of thing that Apple created the iBook Store for.\nIf that's a correct hypothesis, you should use Baker for design books, or rich photographic books, or HTML5 books with videos, animations and sounds. In other terms: anything that's not possible in epub (or: iBook, Kindle).\n. Uhm yes, from the example it looks clearly a case for Baker: iBook (epub) doesn't support these things. You should probably ping back Apple.\n. Well, it's hard to tell because not all the authors tell us, but so far we have counted at least 7 of them, from quite simple ones to more evolved ones. Also, as I've told you, you can't reproduce what you are making with epub (\"it should be reformatted for epub\"), so it's really an arbitrary decision from their side.\n. That's a really good point. :)\n. Thanks for this feedback. It's something already in planning, that is going to collect a serie of feedbacks we received both from there, Twitter and mail.\nThat's why we worked so much at the double-tap function: it's going to be there. ;)\n. As it happens with the other apps, it's more probably due to different people that check them. :)\n. It is active. :)\n\"Q: Is iBooks available in every country with an App Store?\nA: Yes, iBooks and the iBookstore are available in all App Store countries. iBookstore content varies by country.\"\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4059\nSince 28th of May 2010: http://www.apple.com/it/pr/library/2010/05/07ipad.html\n. I really don't know about the Apple guideline. We keep receiving notification of people that were able to publish successfully (I'm a little late in updating the Baker Published books page, there's a really excellent one), so even I can understand the rejection somehow, surely the line is incredibly blurred.\nDo you have any example of such iBook with a \"fixed layout\"? I wasn't able to find a reliable source, and I abandoned the search inside the Apple documentation after an unsuccessful research.\nI'm following ePub 3 since a few months before the release of Baker - well, before we even started coding - and it seems another book-centric approach, without any requirements for a specific rendering mode - exactly like ePub 2. While ePub 3 looks like an excellent step forward, I still don't understand the need of such a complicated standard, when we do have HTML5. It could have been just an extension of it, instead of a limitation of it plus lots of other details (and there are features afaik still missing that again Baker does, like the book:// url scheme). :)\n. Ok, I suppose I can close this issue since there's not much we can do at this time. We'll reopen if something new happens. :)\n. You surely could, it's just not something that comes right out of the box with Baker Framework, for now. But I think it's an interesting feature worth considering. :)\n. We scheduled it, but it's quite low priority for now, if someone wants to pick this feature up just talk with us. :)\n. Hello! \nIt's really hard to understand what's happening, is it possible for you to send us a ZIP with the book you are making, changing the images with dummy ones so we can see it? :)\n. Thanks! Send it to: info AT bakerframework DOT com :)\n. This was resolved through email. It was a problem solved by removing the \"build/\" folder (or a Clean all targets equivalent).\n. Hi k8fisher,\nTo use Baker Framework you don't have to learn anything more than HTML and CSS, so, you just need to put your HTML files in the book/ folder as explained in the readme.\nReally, there isn't anything else to do. :)\nTo create a menu like you asked you can borrow ideas from other Baker books that has been published, from in-page sliders (you tap on a corner and you get the menu) to a simple link to one of the first pages. All HTML.\nYou can develop everything inside your browser (check the test book from the website) and then put the files in the book/ folder an compile. :)\n. I think that Florian's work just posted here with more details on his website should be able to answer a lot of your questions. ;)\nIt's the issue #83.\nFor the sample books we are updating the website soon with some of them. :)\n. We added a page on the website with all the published books we are aware of: http://bakerframework.com/books\nAlso, there is a more detailed tutorial: http://bakerframework.com/tutorials/basic\nIf you need more help, just ping back. :)\n. Wow Florian, that's amazing! :D\nYou did an impressive job! :D\nWhich version of Baker did you use?\nDid you make any change, or did you build just over the current Baker framework? (i.e. is it going to be easy to upgrade to the upcoming 2.0?). :)\nPlease ping us back when the app is approved, too. :)\n. Ok, I think it's too late for the 2.0 but it's something we can look into for the next version. :)\nI'll test it out asap and we'll get back in contact. For now... well, it's an amazing work.\nDo you mind if we add a link back from our site when we update it? :)\n. Florian, just a quick update: we added your project in our brand new tutorial page for the 2.0: http://bakerframework.com/tutorials\nAnd when your app is released by Apple I think it's a great entry for our showcase page. ;)\n. Well, on our side we are looking forward to integrate give the same features on the Cocoa side, and I think it's fine to have Laker as a framework on top of it. But of course Florian, if you have other ideas let's discuss them. ;)\n. No worries! Florence really did an amazing work! \nThanks for the support! :)\n. Very nice. I just tweeted about it! ;)\n. Thank you! These comments helps a lot in keeping the morale up! :)\n. I'll close this one to follow Issue #196, and waiting for the update to Laker there. :)\n. Ok, to summarize:\n- It's outside the scope of Baker as it's intended.\n- It seems doable in javascript.\n- Still, it's going to be managed well with the multi-hpub support, once ready.\nI think that's all, I close this issue. If there's something else, please comment. ;)\n. Awesome work! I hope we can merge it easily with the master branch! :)\nWell there is a change that we discussed, that is able to improve the overall effectiveness of the Hpub format: instead of \"navigation.htm\" we were implementing \"index.html\". This for a few reasons:\n- It's already well understood and used on the web\n- It specify it's an index, but not necessarily a navigation\n- It makes automatically compatible for web reading any Hpub unzipped book\n- If the file is there, navigation exists. If the file isn't there, navigation is turned off automatically. ;)\nThe summary is: a simple change that triggers huge benefits. :)\nI'm writing this just to be more transparent - it's my fault, I should have written this discussion we had in our last weekly call - Simbul is already aware of this and he's probably checking this part too when merging. :)\n. That's awesome, please keep us updated also on that front! :)\n. Do you still have the page that crashed Baker so we can check it out? :)\n. We don't want to promote any specific ad platform, so we didn't include any library in Baker, but it's quite simple to modify the code to allow that following one of the many tutorials around. :)\n. Well there's plenty of content around, it depends a lot on your skills and needs:\nhttp://www.raywenderlich.com/1371/how-to-integrate-iad-into-your-iphone-app\nFrom this simple query:\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+add+iad+to+my+app\n. Oh, sorry I misunderstood. :)\nWhile Baker uses HTML5 for the book itself, iAd is a component in Cocoa that interacts with the app itself, not with the book. :)\n. Did you try reading the Apple doc?\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/iAd_Guide/BannerAdvertisements/BannerAdvertisements.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009881-CH3-SW2\nOr googling around:\nhttp://bees4honey.com/blog/tutorial/how-to-add-iad-banner-in-iphoneipad-app/\nIf you aren't able to solve the problem with these, I might suggest to try using StackOverflow or directly on Apple's dev forums. :)\n. The library part - or shelf, how sometimes we call it - is something we are working on but it's still missing from the engine itselft. MagGames built its own on top of the download book feature we created, the same it's working for the book:// links. :)\nAt this time you have three choices:\n1. Build the shelf in HTML5 as the \"initial\" book, with the rest downloaded (remember to put a back link to the downloaded issues)\n2. Find a Objective-C developer to add that feature for you\n3. Wait for us to implement it\n:)\n. It should be this CSS command:\n-webkit-user-select: none;\nSource:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/923782/disable-the-text-highlighting-magnifier-on-touch-hold-on-mobile-safari-webkit\nTell us if it works. :)\n. Great! \nThank you. :)\n. 1. In the same way you'd do in HTML5. Google for the various techniques, for example: http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/\n2. Yes: each HTML will be one page, and the turning is between each HTML page.\n3. The transition is default, but you could change it modifying the Objective-C source code.\n4. To make it available to one of two people it depends on who they are: you could show the HTML page itself on the web before including it in Baker, you could build with Baker and give them the developer versions or you could roll them out using the Ad-Hoc profile (the latter are all managed by Apple, check their documentation for that).\nYou're welcome. :)\n. Well, I think that you could try doing it, experimenting is a great way to learn it. :)\nMost of you questions are on the Apple side: Xcode, distribution and such, so there's a lot of documentation and tutorials out there to help you with it. :)\nHowever:\n1. The developer beta could be something like this: https://testflightapp.com/ or this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40154/how-do-you-beta-test-an-iphone-app\n2. Once the HTML5 files are complete it's a matter of minutes: drop the book inside the book/ folder, compile and the only thing that remains to do is to distribute it (with one of the options above: dev, ad-hoc or store).\n. Uhm I think I can mark this discussion as closed. :)\n. It's one of the modifications made in Laker, that we are considering adding... Thanks for opening the ticket so we can track it. :)\n. On Baker, yes, open the file RootViewController (https://github.com/Simbul/baker/blob/master/Classes/RootViewController.m) and you'll see a few configuration constants at the top of the file, two of them control the background: SCROLLVIEW_BGCOLOR and PAGE_NUMBERS_COLOR. :)\n. It's the same thing on the two, since Laker is still Baker at the core.\nYou can try downloading the master branch from GitHub, we are working trying to optimize page loading. It's hard, but we have something. ;)\nSee Issue #27 for more infos.\n. It isn't easy, but that's exactly what we are working on. :)\n. ...well, er... you have to code it yourself. ;)\n. Ok I'll check asap. ;)\n. Worth considering: on the actual beta of iOS5 the spinner doesn't show up on back background, they changed the grey sprite. We'll check again before the final iOS5 release.\n. What version are you using? The latest master?\nHowever yes, if you could provide more informations at home it would be valuable. :)\n. Were you able to test it? Is it the same thing you were discussing in the topic three-cards? :)\n. Ok, I'll close. I'll reopen if you can confirm it. ;)\n. We are following that part, and we'll integrate in Baker as much as possible as soon as we get details about Newsstand - and iOS5 will be released (due to the legal restrictions of the prerelease of iOS5). :)\n. Reference links:\n- http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/StoreKit/Reference/NewsstandKit_Framework/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010838\n- https://support.urbanairship.com/customer/portal/articles/140033-adding-newsstand-support-to-your-app\n. Ok, Newsstand is implemented in the current master (future 3.1), to show up the magazine in the Newsstand folder, it was quite simple, some documentation is on the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-support\nFor the full Newsstand support (background downloads) we need first to implement the multi-book issue / shelf support, Issue #20.\nSo, even if now Baker apps will appear in Newsstand, we keep this Issue open until we have the full support.\n. First we need to close Issue #20, scheduled for 4.0 release, and that's pretty big. Only after that we will be able to see if we can do the full Newsstand integration. :)\nWe have no date, unfortunately, since we can work on this only in our spare time.\n. For our knowledge and prioritization...\nWhat do you need about Newsstand exactly? :)\nAbout Paying... we can only accept donations because they help us to keep running, but we can't provide a specific schedule since it's not our daily work (unless we get enough donations, of course).\nIf you'd like to pay to have some kind of delivery date however, you might hire a developer and put him in direct contact with us so we can work together. ;)\n. Uhm then I don't know, I didn't dig yet into too much detail, but from what I saw it's just an add-on to an existing shelf system, see the urban aircraft link above.\nIf someone has more details it would be nice. :)\n. Ok, then it's exactly as I was saying:\n1. Identify the App as Newsstand: DONE, it will be released as 3.1 (see above, on this thread).\n2. Download multiple issues: PLANNED. It's this very issue, and it's dependant of Issue #20, \n3. Purchasing: NOT planned, and so far nobody asked yet, but I think if it's the case, it's going to be after Issue #20 and after this issue as well.\n4. Push : NOT planned, nobody asked for it so far. Again it's an add-on, and not Newsstand dependent.\n:)\n. Thanks guys. getting this kind of support, suggestions and attention is AWESOME. :)\nBtw, if someone thinks that the other two things above (Purchases and Push) should be done, feel free to open an issue. Push in particular should be possible to be added independently of everything else. :)\nWe have also the code re-factoring to allow easier embedding, but that's a really big chunk, we are trying to balance out optimizations and features right now. :)\n. May I just ask you to proceed on Issue #20? Because here is a bit off topic, the Shelf is there. ;)\n. Awesome, thanks! :D\nIt's ok, nice idea of summarizing. ;)\n. As you can read from the comment above, Newsstand is a set of different features:\n1. The UI in the Springboard to visualize the app as a magazine\n2. The Background Download feature\nCurrently Baker implements (1), not (2), both of them are \"Newsstand\". :)\n. Not that I'm aware of. But 3.1 has been released only today, so that would have been hard. :)\n. Do you have any evidence of a iPad Newsstand magazine rejected because it's missing a multi-issue download? We'd like to see exactly the reasoning behind that to have a clearer view. :)\n@mutador please don't be misled by the default book. We use that just as a simple test, to show how simple it is to publish with the platform, it's not by any mean expression of our understanding of the full possibilities of Baker, as you can clearly see. We are well aware of the needs of professional publishing for magazine. :)\n. @tstegart Uhm, yes. If someone could try to submit a magazine with Baker 3.1 without the auto-update we can see if that will get you rejected... or not. :)\n. Yes, it's a good point. :)\n. Uhm there's no documentation or links. Do you know what it does and if there's a source?\n. TODO:\n1. Implement Newsstand Subscriptions to be a fully Newsstand app (a \"Subscribe\" button in the toolbar and the underlying code to manage it).\n2. Implement icon switch support with the icon of the latest publication.\n. If someone has more informations on the MINIMAL set of features we are missing to be accepted as a Newsstand app it would be great. Right now it seems we have to create \"Free subscriptions\" with the app that can barely acknowledge them.\nThis answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11895035/do-newsstand-apps-require-push-notifications\n\nNo, Apple's guidelines do not mandate the use of push notifications, and your app should not be rejected for not using them.\n\nSeems implying that we might not even implement a portion of that to allow Newsstand apps to exist, even if of course it would be ideal.\n. Thanks. For me the most important part is:\n\nHowever I do know for a fact that you don't have to implement push notifications.\n\nBecause the guidelines doesn't help really much. Like: does a \"Free Subscription\" require any coding at all (11.12)? The answer seems yes in theory, but in practice seems no...\n. It's not complete yet, but this is a good starting point, check if it works for you: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-vs-Bundled-publications-support-in-Baker-4.0\n. I quickly added a page, check this: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-shelf-JSON\n. Hi @tstegart thank you very much for the detailed feedback! That's great! :+1: \nLet's see...\n1. Yes, the title will be editable or generic. It's an excellent point. :)\n2. The about button isn't part of version 4.0, you're the first asking for such a thing (and there are apps in the store without it) but let's see what other people think and keep track of it: open a new issue so we have it. That will also allow anybody that wants to contribute to develop that and send us a Push Request. :)\n3. Preview is something that almost no other platform provides, and it would be overkill to add right now both for us and authors, but that said it's surely an interesting feature, and it's worth its own issue. ;)\nAbout your questions:\n1. The full background is an image, so it's COMPLETELY CUSTOM. :)\n2. The shelf scrolls, vertical. Try it. ;)\n. Ok. :)\n1. The background is fixed everything scrolls above it but the top part is always free (try it), we found it's the best solution to achieve flexibility and customizability with the lowest possible effort. :)\n2. For the todo list just check the milestone 4.0 here on GitHub, click \"Milestones\" at the top of this page. :)\n. We evaluated that options and while we agree it would be great... it's overkill trying to push it out right now, since it's the least required one and will require a lot more code to be written.\nShelf functionality... it's already there: the problem isn't \"shelf\" but \"How do you manage the updates?\". That's the big problem. :)\n. What do you mean by deleting the transition? :)\n. We'd love to show the pages too. ;)\nUnfortunately, that's very hard. See Issue #27. :)\n. Maybe it's that I just don't understand what you want to do. Could you explain yourself a little better?\nIs it any of these?\n1. Remove just the number and the loader indicator (A: just change the color of the label in RootViewController.m, line 38)\n2. Remove the swipe transition, making pages just appear one after the other (A: needs coding)\n3. Remove the fade-in transition, making the pages just appear (A: needs coding)\n4. Show the next page immediately, without any delay (A: read the whole Issue #27)\n. Yeah, then it's #27, that's a very hard problem. :)\n. Hi Fortes :)\nFirst of all, thanks for the suggestions! These are very constructive contribution. :)\nNow, point by point:\n1. Objects in pages: it adds a bit of complexity but allows also the simpler form, and I think it's a good compromise. I'd just add that we should formalize a bit which fields are required in the hash form. Given what you wrote, I think that \"url\", \"title\" and \"author\" are the fields that we could add in the HPub standard and leave the rest to extensions. OK.\n2. Custom metadata: here I'm not sure, because it means that from opening a HPub you wouldn't know what's in the standard - and so, must be supported - and what's not. I was thinking along the lines of the CSS specification, that so far I think it's working pretty well, adding prefixes for extensions, like \"x-\". My doubt is that if we say in the standard \"and then you can use whatever field you want with any name... well... it's not a standard anymore, no? :) Do you have a strong position in favor of allowing custom metadata in that way and not inside a x-name block, specified by each reader technology?\n3. Rename pages array: I see your point, and between the various choices I think that \"content\" is the best solution, because it's precise enough, but doesn't suggest a specific form of the output. OK.\n4. Properties vs x-baker: This part was a big discussion we had during a few of our calls. The idea is this: \"properties\" defines things that are related to the book, in a generic way. So orientation and pinchToZoom are in this perspective properties of the book and the rendering engine should read these and adapt accordingly. Instead, the extensions are add-ons, out of the standard, so a book might not use them at all. While not specifying the orientation is a problem, because all the tablets out there can manage that, ignoring \"background\" is just something that affect the specific \"Baker\" rendering engine, and another reader, for example Treesaver, can safely ignore them. In a similar fashion if Treesaver wants to support certain extended parameters, it can safely read the x-treesaver hash and get them, while Baker will read the book still very well by ignoring them. As for Baker, we are trying to get rid of those, that are mostly related to technical limitations, so they will just disappear as soon as possible. The CSS suggestion you are making is basically the same, we just group extensions in specific hashes (think also that some x-baker or x-treesaver features might not be \"properties\" or \"settings\" at all, maybe they are metadata or content or protections or else). Now that I explained the difference, do you still think we should merge everything in a single \"settings\" hash? If yes, could you list he pros of that choice? :)\n. Thanks for the follow up. :)\n1. Ok for \"contents\". :)\n2. Ok for page hashes in contents. Ok for url being the only required one.\n3. Metadata: I think we have to split this in two. Pages metadata and Book metadata.\n4. Page metadata: I can agree that anything could be added here. I can't see any harm in adding more stuff than the specified one, even if they become vendor specific, it's quite impossible to add anything else but metadata here and being already nested two times inside both contents and page, makes it quite restrictive already.\n5. Book metadata: This for me is trickier, and again it's splitted in different topics. I'll take an example to show you why. \n   1. On explicit extension naming (x- or similar): Let's say someone adds a \"license\" attribute, that looks like as native, and it's a string. Then, someone else adds another \"license\" attribute, but he makes it an hash with a string for the readable name, a url for the full license and a MD5 hash to identify it in their system. What happens then? A book shared between the two will show random data or behave strangely. And, after that, we can't anymore standardize it because the \"license\" parameter has already been taken and we will break any past book if we norm that after the problem happened. \n   2. On grouping: I think this allows more flexiblity: as Baker I have to take care only of the x-baker block, and you as Treesaver can ignore it safely, instead of iterating through all the elements. Also, using a block like that optimizes typing: instead of typing -baker-background, -baker-verticalBounce, -baker-indexHeigh, -baker-mediaAutoPlay we'll type x-baker once and it's done. And \"background\" in Baker is a very specific thing, that is going probably to exist in Baker only, until we remove it because it's just a workaround. So, it would be an even bigger problem if ALL the authors everywhere needs to take care of the background property. Plus in this way at root level we have just metadata and structure, no strange things, it's very clean.\n   3. On proper metadata: If you really think that Hpub is missing a metadata, you can start adding it in your client x- section, but then you can come here, discuss, and we'll add it if there's enough consensus in the community.\n   4. My stance: of this list, I think that 1 is really important, 2 is just my preference, but I see your point here, and 3 is a very important part to progress the standard and to aggregate the community. So, if we want to meet in the middle ground, I think that your option (2) above is the one I'd choose: \"Prefixed, top level\".\n6. Author/Creator: Ok, I agree also here on your suggestion of making them arrays, and I agree in making it not overly complex: just names.\n7. What is a property: Given your opinion, I agree on how \"pinchToZoom\" looks device-dependent. It should be probably named \"zoomable\" or something like that. A publication supporting \"zoomable\" and \"orientation\" to me needs to behave that way in any device. A browser is zoomable, for example even if it doesn't support pinch, and disallowing or allowing so is a choice in the hands of the author. Orientation is kinda the same: a device needs to know if it can turn the page sideways when needed (through a gyroscope, but why not, even through a specific UI element). So, these are strictly related to the book. Instead, things like \"x-baker/indexHeight\" will be used only in Baker and control a specific way Baker handles the index overlay... until we are able to automate that. :) But I think that this point is solved for you if we choose (2) \"Prefixed, top level\" right? :)\n8. Nested contents: It's not for Baker, but I can see why you raise that point. We can reserve right now the word \"contents\" inside a page, it doesn't do harm, but we might avoid to spec that out until some more discussion at a later time. Or do you think it's urgent? :)\n. Yes. I agree @bramstein.\n@Fortes, could you check my update to the top example (first message of this page)? Does it work for you? Is there some mismatch? :)\n. Yes, we'll double check with the others when they are back, but I think that's the version that makes everyone happy. :)\nI also agree with you for the future evolution, that's exactly what I'm hoping for. :)\n(btw, nice spotting of that kind of behaviour possibility) :D\n. @bramstein Uhm given what I understand from your explanation it seems a behaviour that derives from some development choices you are giving your developers, so I think it could be something that Treesaver is free to manage inside its own custom parameters. :)\nAnd then, as @fortes was saying, if something very solid and of common interests emerges between all your users, we can just discuss in the following standard, mostly like CSS. :)\n. Wow that would have been a big oversight. ^^\nWhat do you think?\njs\n  \"hpub\": 1.0\nWould be ok? :)\n. Thanks. We'll check. :)\n(btw, the video is marked as \"private\"...) \n. Wonderful :)\n. Duplicated. (dunno why...)\n. This issue is a duplicate. Check Issue #104, it's not yet started unfortunately.\n. Uhm... yes? :)\n. It does, there are already a few working on that and at least a released app. However it's not yet in our codebase, we have a lower priority on that, and they coded / are coding their own solutions. :)\nThat said however, as a workaround you could use downloadable books. It's a bit annoying, mind you, but that wouldn't require any additional coding.\nSee issue #20 for this. :)\n. Hi!\nGiven there's no follow up we'll consider this as closed, if you have other questions just write here. ;)\n. Hello! Thanks for the tip! :)\nMay I ask why did you choose Adobe Digital edition instead of doing everything with Baker? :)\n. Thanks for the feedback and the confirmation of the fields where we need to improve. :)\nThat said, I may suggest you to try our current master version: while not fully ready, many speed improvement are already there and will be soon released in the 3.0. :)\n. Well, 1 and 2 are in the timeline, and 3 should probably arrive with Baker 3.0. It's not really a way to get rid of the loading (because that's CPU and RAM dependent) but it's a nice workaround. :)\nAlso, a few developer started developing 2, but until now there is still no completed code that we could merge to the main branch of Baker. :)\n. Well, we wanted to release it a couple of weeks ago but we hit a few bugs, so now we are working on them. We are targeting now an early september release, due to additional holiday delays.\nWhat I could suggest is however to give a try to the trunk version, and check back before submitting the store for news. :)\n. No trouble. :)\nClick on \"Source\" on the top menu of this page, then use git (there are lots of manuals) or just download the latest version (big Download button on the right of the Source page). :)\n. It's not very clear, yeah, but since 3.0 isn't still released there's no 3.0 package. You should \"Download Source\", either zip or tar.gz. :)\n. Nope, sorry. We are still working optimization, unfortunately we're still not there.\nYou can check the milestone 3.0 to see how it's going. :)\n. Given that we noticed many authors disable it and basically no other app does that... it's probably a feature that might be removed... even if it was nice to have, getting that tiny speedup in basically all the page might be worth it. :)\n. Uhm it doesn't seem related to me but... who knows. Let's test. Two things:\n1. Can you give us a sample page to test?\n2. Does it work in Safari mobile? :)\n. Thanks to you all! :D\nOk, given the received feedback we are going to remove it. :)\n. Yes, exactly. It's already on Master. :)\n. We'll always work to ensure that's as much as possible solid and bug free, of course. But being an opensource project you can download it right now, test it, and tell if you can find bugs. That's the best way to ensure a great product. :)\nWe slowed down a bit now, since a few of us are on holiday, but in september we should be out with Baker 3.0, that incorporates all the code-level changes made in Laker (plus more) so you don't have to compile a different codebase anymore: it's just Baker (Objective-C) and Laker (HTML/CSS/JS).\nIf you have any doubt, please tell us! :)\n. @Dieter\nThe roadmap is open and discussed right here. :)\nCheck all the open issues, the discussions there and, probably most of all, click on \"Milestones\" at the top of the page. :)\nThe 3.0 is the current head, will be 3.0 once released before we move to 3.1. :)\nAlso, please, read the related issues for Newsstand and Library and help us directly. It makes sense, it's just a matter of developing it and integrating. Right now we are in the middle of a big optimization push, but for everything else please let's collaborate and improve this one. \nTo give you a couple of pointers, the discussion about Newsstand is Issue #100, and the one about the multi-book is Issue #20.\n. @dixiepnum\n1. Baker 3.0 specs are on the Milestones page above. :)\n2. For Laker you should refer to Florian, I'll ping him since we are talking a lot so he can give you his answer. :)\n3. Yes. We are an opensource project with limited resources, and Florian too. So we aren't able to set dates, but we are trying to stick to some indicative timelines. It's hard, but usually we are able to do it. This time we are aiming for a september release for Baker 3.0, we can't assure it, but it's feasible given we don't hit any other nasty bug. :)\n4. Yep, I was checking it and looked simple. I'm still not sure if we have to build the multi-book support before integrating with Newsstand however. But let's move that discussion on Issue #100. :)\n5. That issue is what we have, so exactly like you we don't have any other news. We checked the forked tree he was working on, and while improved, it's still not complete to be integrated back into Baker, so we are waiting until either someone does that, or we are going to do it ourselves (Baker 4.0, I suppose).\n6. Yes. With baker you should be able to work easily with an arbitrary number of pages (given hw limitation hehe). That's not an issue. :)\nIf you feel we aren't working as fast as you'd like, I can suggest that you'll work with us instead of forking it, so we can build a better tool for anybody. In that case just keep us updated and start forking from master. If we are able to collaborate we'll be stronger together. :)\n. Yes unfortunately that's a fork, and it's not Baker judging from the code. If you check the fork tree here on github you'll see the other fork with the multi-issues work. :)\n. LOL! :D\nWell, I can't answer for Florian, but we built Baker 3.0 including all the features that he added in Baker 2.0 to make its Laker release (plus more, of course). In my opinion, with Baker 3.0 onward we should have:\n1. Baker as the Objective-C part (Xcode)\n2. Laker as the HTML/CSS/JS part (Hpub book/ folder)\nIn this way we are going to build each other on our respective strengths keeping a clean separation and upgrade path for all our users. :)\n. On Laker website, yes, because he builds over Baker Framework code. :)\n. Laker has been updated to version 1.2 with full Baker 3.0 support by the awesome @ffranke. :)\nMore info here: http://www.lakercompendium.com/2011/12/27/laker-1-2-and-a-few-notes/\n. That's totally a requirement. We need to check it out. If you have anything that could help, please link it to us here. ;)\n. It might break something else, but we'll check, thanks! :D\n(also tell Romain to come here if he has some more tips to share :D)\n. So, the idea could be that to open a link in Mobile Safari you have to add a parameter to the URL, like:\nhttp://example.org/page.html?referrer=baker\nAny other link instead will be opened inside Baker itself. So if you type:\nhttp://example.org/page.html\nThe page will be opened INSIDE Baker, as a page.\n. Well, we are using the same engine as Safari Mobile, so everything you can do there should be possible in Baker too. :)\n. Excellent, thanks for the feedback! :D\nWe'll go ahead with that then. :)\n. It might be a bug, because I think Xm4s already worked on a similar problem while addressing this issue.\nAdding the ?referrer=Baker will take you outside the book to Safari, so I suppose it's not what are you looking for. :)\n. I think you should ask Florian about this, Laker (and so, JavaScript) is his part. It's strange however that you can't swipe, since it's Baker doing that. Does it work if you tap on the side? :)\n. Uh that's a wonderful analysis, thanks! :)\nI might guess that DND.js intercepts ALL the touch events on the page, factually removing them from the app and making Baker unable to move. That's a very drastic choice by Wink, I wonder what they do in the codebase. :)\n. After checking it out for a bit I guess it's something we don't have any control on, it's completely eaten by the page and we can't intercept it. You might contact the author of Wink or check another way to do dnd... :|\n. There's no layer above it, but it might be related to the current acceleration between pages. :)\nWe'll check. :)\n. Not yet sorry, I'm the only one here these days, the other in the team are on hols. :)\n. Cool! :)\n. I'd say that we have to wait for the final version of iOS 5 to see if this issue is still there, since it's a WebKit issue. :)\n. Hi ffranke, were you able to check if this bug is still there? :)\n. Excellent! I'll close this issue then. :)\nNope, you didn't! Looks awesome, I'll check it out better asap. :D\n. Does it happen only with CSS animations or also with JavaScript animations? :o\n. Hahaha I know, I was just trying to nail down the problem. Do you have a sample page that you can link for testing? :)\nWell, if JS is delayed and CSS not, we might have a simple workaround by triggering a class when the page is displayed, and the class triggers then the CSS animations. But still, that would be a workaround.\nFor now, I'll mark this as bug. :)\n. Ok, thanks. :)\n. Right now we are thinking about adding a couple of JS callbacks, so you'll know when the page is \"shown\".\nProblem: that will break compatibility with anything that's not Baker, so we'll see. I'd prefer to avoid it. :)\n. Btw, I found this code, did someone tried it yet?\nhttp://code.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/pagevisibility.html\n. Xmas just did a commit this morning, try the current master. ;)\n. Well: \n1. icon and loading image \u2014 yes, since they need to be builtin.\n2. google analytics \u2014 I don't know what you are using\n3. portrait/landscape setting \u2014 no, when we are going to release the new spec (book.json), except for the loading screen, yes\n. Couldn't you just specify the height of the page in CSS? :)\n. May I mark this as closed? :)\n. Sure. :)\nIt's a UIColor: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIColor_Class/Reference/Reference.html\nHowever once book.json will be in place it's going to be very simple and more flexible. :)\n. Ok! :)\nOn our side, this will be solved once the book.json is in place, so I'll close this issue. :)\nThanks! :)\n|D\n. Uhm that's strange indeed, we need to sort it out.\nIn the meantime, does the javascript alternative work?\njavascript:location.reload(true)?\n. Argh. Ok, thanks. :)\n. Ok, I hope however to avoid that workaround soon hehehe :)\nI can also guess why that happens, since we have some caching in place, that might be it. :)\n. Nope, sorry. Xmas is working on this and is taking care of the caching issue first. :)\n. Yes, Issue #3. :)\nBut it's still low priority due to the low demand.\n. It's very strange, a crash isn't usually related to a memory issue. How are you adding these? Are you using Baker 2.0?\n. Uhm but are you using any JS? To debug it we need the simplest page possible that triggers the bug. Seeing the app would be nice, but won't give much informations.\nDid you try running Instruments or GDB to try track down the error? Or, what does the stack trace give in the logs?\n. From what you sent us, it seems you are using Pano2VR, that uses HTML5, Canvas and WebGL.\nWebGL is a very young technology and I think it might create quite a few issues in our current Baker implementation, but I don't know why exactly why it crashes. It gives me absolutely no error, it just crashes. And yes, it might be some problem in the canvas or WebGL implementation, because it happens without giving me any memory warning (only occasionally).\nBtw on my iOS5 beta crashes immediately, even the first page.\n. Thank you very much. :)\n. Unfortunately it all depends on how Apple implements the UIWebView and the bugs solved there, we have no control over it. That article is almost one year old and so it should be done a more recent benchmark, maybe on the final iOS5 release that will be out in a couple of days.\nWe can't do much there, unless someone is going to develop a JavaScript library targeted to Mobile Safari / UIWebView specifically.\n. Uhm. It might be a byproduct when we add the manifest book.json support.\nWe'll check :)\n. Uhm not really, because it's just a guess, and if we had the code we probably would have that already in place ;)\nHowever that could be possible because right now the lock is at package level, instead for manifest we might move the lock to code level and being in the code it should be possible to dynamically enable or disable it.\n. I'll close this but... of course, if you find someone that has the solution or if you find that solution yourself, ping us that we will implement it. ;)\n. Yeah, that's a problem with page caching, it's the mirror problem of Issue #122\n. In Issue #27 we have now removed the three cards feature in favor of the dynamic image caching. We'll de-scope Issue #122 and this one since it's not critical anymore for 3.0 release \u2014 Mostly because it could be almost impossible to fix this in any other way.\nWhen we'll implement Issue #122, if three-cards flag is turned on then you could remove the video as well, so it shouldn't be a problem in either way.\n. Hi leo! :)\nMultiple HPub support is coming. Progress, feedbacks and comments are tracked on the Issue #20, right here, and it's currently scheduled to be released in Baker 4.0. :)\n. Hi! :)\nThat's new, but I think it's going to be fixed during our current work on master - I hope, since we are working on pagination and caching. Wait for the next commit and check it again ;)\n. OK, there's a new commit, try it out. :)\n. Well, we can't say for sure about stability until we finalize it. ;)\nHowever, what version are you testing? The last master committed today? This master caches the pages, so after the first time, any subsequent load should be incredibly fast. :)\n. Uhm I'll ping Xmas on that, he was working on the feature... \n. Awesome! :D\n. Uhm, it's a good point. \nI wonder if we could maybe use the wiki for that? What do you think?\n. Ok, check the Wiki section on top. You should be already able to edit and add pages... ;)\n. It should be easy just using the multilingual feature of iOS apps, but even if we know it was done in one of the previous versions of Baker, I didn't test with the latest one.\nCheck however a resource like this one:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5748600/making-multi-language-ios-app\n. Well, multi-language support isn't much different from what you describe, but right now I didn't dig into it so I can't tell you if it's easily possible and how.\n. It might be as easy as adding the two localization folders and put inside each one the \"book/\" folder:\nhttp://www.raywenderlich.com/2876/how-to-localize-an-iphone-app-tutorial\nBut I can't confirm right now, I need some time to test it. :)\n. Yeah, sorry, but I can't help more than this right now. We'll track this as a feature and we'll add it in a future version. :|\n. However we asked for support on Twitter, if we have news we'll write here. Also, we'll write here when we are able to get on that part of the project, so you'll be updated either way. :)\n. @morands It's still in development, and it will be merged into Baker when it's ready. :)\n. Uhm I think I need to understand better what you need: why isn't index.html valid for your menu? :)\nWhat are you trying to do? :)\n. Sure. You just have to attach to the matching event and send a specific javascript command to the UIWebView. However, you should be able to catch it in JavaScript before the double-tap reaches ObjC. :)\nIt's not clear to me why index.html wouldn't work, however. :)\n. But what version of Baker are you using? Index.html is just in the latest working branch. :)\n. Ok: index.html exists only on the current development master that is going to be released in september. You can  get it from the download button clicking on the toolbar above on Source and then \"Download\". :)\n. You're welcome. If you find any bug, just write them here in the appropriate Issue or by opening a new one. :)\n. We didn't test, but it might work if you add it in the index.html. Please however: add a pause button. :D\n. Excellent! :)\nAutoplay is a little buggy on WebKit side. Does turning OFF the MEDIA_PLAYBACK_REQUIRES_USER_ACTION flag helps maybe?\n. ...may I ask also if you can paste on a https://gist.github.com/ the code and link it here, so others can find and use it? :)\n. Uhm let me check. ;)\n. Ok, it seems that it's loaded at the beginning, but we'll check in detail. ;)\n. Could you paste here the full line of the title tag, or maybe the full head tag? It should be related with something in the title. :)\n. To paste code you can use the sister website of Github, Gist: https://gist.github.com/ :)\nOk, that looks fine... mumble. Could you paste (here or on Gist) the full stacktrace? :)\n. A-ha! That's an excellent discovery! :D\n. I think I can close this, right? :)\n. That's a really good question, I never thought about that. :)\nIn theory, Baker just uses the WebKit engine provided by the OS, so, probably, it will use the more recent version on iOS5 and the older one on iOS4.x, but I can't tell it for sure.\nUsually, I would advise to use the same web fallback techniques if you need to use more advanced features, in order to have a magazine on all the devices, and a better looking / working one on the latest version.\nI'm asking a few friends, let's see if I can get a better answer. ;)\n. Ok, the answer I received is that the engine gets updated with the iOS, so if you really need to use advanced features add some kind of graceful fallback. :)\nWhat kind of feature are you thinking of? :)\n. Ok, that's clear. :D\n. I didn't test it, but it might be possible changing line 308 of the current master (or... are you working on Baker 2.0?) where it says:\ncurrentPageNumber = 1;\nChanging 1 to the default page number you want to start with. ;)\nIt should be something similar in Baker 2.0. ;)\n. Awesome. :)\nWe should make a constant out of it. ;)\n. Right now, they live in the Obj-C side of the code, but you are right, they are going to be moved inside the book.json manifest that will be soon added, so nobody has to edit Obj-C code anymore. :)\nCheers!\n. Nope: as you can see in this issue tracker the feature is still open: we're still implementing it. :)\nOn Baker 2.0 you have to edit the constants at the top of the Obj-C file. ;)\n. There are plenty of books on the store that are using videos. As far as I know, a HTML5 video tag does the job. What problem are you having?\n. Does it work on Safari Mobile? :)\n. Excellent. :)\nAs a general rule of thumb, I'd suggest to test on Safari / Safari Mobile in order to see if it's a problem with the engine itself. Since we embed directly the engine, it's usually a nice way to isolate specific problems (and maybe even use their debugger :D). :)\n. Well, I suppose it should if it works in Mobile Safari, but it's quite probably an issue with UIWebView, so you might be able to open a bug on Apple's website or on the developer forum. :)\n. Except the book download, that you can get by linking from a book another book using the book:// protocol, everything else is planned for us (you can see around this issue tracker). Babylon did an independent work to support these features before we implemented it. ;)\n. Ok, cheers! :)\n. iPad, you mean iOS 4.x or 5? :)\n. Awesome! :D\n. Did you find anything? :)\n. Was anyone able to do this in the end? :)\n. Great! :D\n. Nope. We are still implementing book.json. :)\nWhen Issue #102 is complete, then you'll be able to use it. :)\n. Yes, we are working on it right now, so something already landed. :)\n. It's a good request, I don't have a simple answer, but maybe some of the others has :)\n. What do you mean by \"isn't stable\"? :)\n. From your description it seems something you have to manage on the HTML side, regardless of Baker. Check this answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/826782/css-rule-to-disable-text-selection-highlighting :)\n. Awesome. :)\n. We are trying to address that problem in the upcoming 3.0 release, however it's a problem related to the limited resources on the iPad (CPU, RAM) and the weight of the HTML browser (UIWebView).\nI don't understand instead the question about the scroller: it should be already hidden and appear only when you scroll. What do you mean exactly? :)\n. In the upcoming release, or in the current GIT Master, the navigator feature is automatic and appears when you add a file called \"index.html\" to your book. :)\nThe zoom instead is disabled by default, since it would be better for you to implement the zoom you need through javascript, but you can re-enable it if you really want this functionality. In Baker 2.0 (the released version) you can do this by editing this line: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/blob/2.0/Classes/RootViewController.m#L47 :)\n. I have no idea of what could be the cause. Usually after cleaning everything and removing the app on the device it solves any issue, but here seems something related to the launch status.\nMaybe: did you try to launch the app keeping it connected but not from Xcode? Something like:\n1. Clean everything, remove app from device\n2. Run on device\n3. Stop the app on Xcode\n4. Remove the app from the multitasking bar\n5. Launch the app from iPad (without disconnecting it).\nThis not because I know what it could be, but just to rule out a few possibilities (i.e. that could be related to the connection status).\nDid you also try to reboot the device? :)\n. Are you using Baker 2.0 or the latest in-progress master from GitHub? :)\n. I'll take then the answer from issue #147: The zoom is disabled by default, since it would be better for you to implement the zoom you need through javascript, but you can re-enable it if you really want this functionality. In Baker 2.0 (the released version) you can do this by editing this line: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/blob/2.0/Classes/RootViewController.m#L47 :)\n. You're welcome :)\n. We are developing in parallel on different iOS and Xcode versions, and we are still waiting a bit to finalize the iOS 5 part. However these problems shouldn't be \"errors\" but \"warnings\", no? It should still compile and run, or am I wrong? :)\n. Yeah, these shouldn't be blocking problems, they are going to be solved, but it still works. :)\n. Thanks to you, it's awesome to have people that take time to come here and collaborate with the community. :)\n. Yes, 3.0 is not out yet with iOS5 support. :)\nHowever I'm able to compile and run it, ignoring the warning, without problems. Are you using Baker 2.0?\n. Did you try if Baker 3.0 just released has the same problem? :)\n. No problem. :)\nFor us it was as simple as updating the project to the latest version of Xcode. :)\n. So far, we didn't implement anything like that, because the pages at this point are isolated and work independently. \nWhat kind of data would you like to store? :)\n. Awesome! :D\nThanks for sharing! :)\n. I think you should do that in JavaScript, there's no built-in support for pagination, just scrolling.\n. I think it might be worth adding a flag to out book.json then ;)\n. It's possible only if you do everything with HTML5, it's not Baker. Baker is made to allow you to publish on the App Store. :)\nThis link, found with a quick search, should help you: http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-native-iphone-ipad-apps-in-javascript/ :)\n. Thank you! :D\n3.0 is near, now :D\n. Thank you all again! :)\nBtw, if you want to have a look, now we are almost there for the release. It's a matter of days... maybe hours. ;)\n. You find them in the Apple documentation on the Developer page. It's quite detailed. :)\nAlso googling you can find interesting resources, like this video from Apple:\nhttps://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/BrowsePrivately/adc.apple.com.1579102445.01579102451.1580085281?i=2050284209\n. Did you try following that video? :)\n. Then I can't help much more, try finding a developer to support you. :)\n. Please, don't open other issues, you have already an open discussion. :)\nAs I said on the other topic, you should ask on Apple Development Forums, not here. It's their stuff. :)\n. Look Roliverooooos, I'm one of the founders, I'm not going away. ;)\nThe right place to ask for that, as I told you, is on the Apple Developer Forum: https://devforums.apple.com/community/ios\nSee ya. :)\n. Could you detail a step-by-step sequence on how to reproduce the problem? :)\n. Just to exclude some possibilities: does it do the same with our demo book?\nIf not, could you give us your index, maybe anonymized? :)\n. The release process is going to stay as simple as it is now: the screenshots are just one of the two new rendering modes to make the reading experience more pleasurable for the users, reducing lag and the impression of slowness, working around iPad limitations. The app will take screenshot in the background in order to make the page switch smoother. ;)\nHere some more details: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Baker-rendering-modes\n. It's in the code (commited yesterday, just create a folder called \"baker-snapshots\" inside the book/ folder), but it's going to be unsupported in the upcoming 3.0 release to not delay it further. Probably it's going to be in the 3.1 release after we implement it better (so yes, it's subject to change). :)\nPlease, open a new issue for that, so we can add to the 3.1 milestone. :)\n. Uhm could you explain a little better the kind of behaviour you're looking for? :)\n. Ahhh I was confused by \"preferred without JavaScript\"... because well, without JavaScript I think we have a problem. :P\nHowever I think that you might try all the alternative Lightbox and Thickbox and such you can find around, they should do the job... I think it's mostly a matter to try finding the one that is good enough for use on Mobile Safari. :)\n. I think it's because Baker still keeps the sequence of pages, so if you try to change by hand the page you're still in that sequence. :)\nDid you try also native jQuery tools like:\n- http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/\n- http://www.designyourway.net/blog/resources/30-efficient-jquery-lightbox-plugins/\n?\n. Nope: having zoom off is a default behavior to create easier to use experiences for the reader (Adobe doesn't do that by default either, like many of good books and magazines. Zinio does that but it's because its magazines aren't made for iPad, they are just scans).\nIf you really need it and you understand the consequences, just turn on the zoomable flag in book.json. :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/hpub-specification\n. What are you using? Baker 2.0 or the current master? :)\n. Then just open RootViewController.m and change line 83 to the orientation you need:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/blob/2.0/Classes/RootViewController.m#L83\n:)\n. You're welcome! :)\n. You can have a look at Laker Compendium for Baker, that does exactly that: http://www.lakercompendium.com/ :)\n. Well, if they want to share what they did they can already, and for everything else we have the Showcase section on the website:\nhttp://bakerframework.com/books\nUnfortunately it's hard to find someone that wants to contribute back with tutorials, examples and support. :)\n. The current work in progress that will be released as 3.0, you can test it clicking on Source above and then clicking on Download. :)\n. Unfortunately it's a bug in WebKit and we are still not able to remove it completely. We saw that sometimes building the page differently, or making them shorter, helps reducing that bug.\nWe are constantly trying to fix that. \n. Thank you! :)\nYes, if the problem is diminished with the update it's another sign that it should be a UIWebView issue, ach. :|\nUnfortunately we tried to identify the moment when the page is really ready, but it seems there's no easy way... :|\n. That's a good suggestion, we'll try it. :)\n. I don't understand. How is that related to the white flash issue described here? Could you detail a little more?\n. Yes please. Open a new issue. I'd advise if you have problems to use the version from the website and not the work in progress from here. :)\n. You are the first one reporting a problem with the stable version. Please open a new issue if you'd like with all the details of the problem you had so we can rule out it was just a problem in your config, since from the message above it seems you are touching the project config, and that might have broken something.\nPlease be also aware that the master version is a development one, an might contain bugs.\n. Nope, sorry.\n. Yup having something else to test would be nice, send it to us at our info mail so we can check it. :)\n. Oh no worries then, because we'd need the book itself to test in a development environment, so we can't do it on a published version and we can't ask you to provide even a split of your published book. :)\n. That's for sure, we are just a little behind with that because I moved and I was without internet for a month now, and my iPad was stolen as well... yeah, not exactly a good period, but now we are planning a meeting for christmas to give the project a little further push. ;)\n. Thank you. :)\n. Uhm then we definitely need more tests, because this fix was proposed in november (see above) and some testers reported it didn't work.\nFor information, what is the background color of the book (-baker-background)?\n. A-ha! That's a great point @nruffilo! We'll look into it this evening. :)\n. Thanks! That's why we started this project, and receiving these comments gives us a great morale boost. :)\n. @Xm4s worked on it, but from what I got it's due to some edge behaviour when the page is scrolled in a combination with existing backgrounds. He has already a solution in mind, but unfortunately we didn't have time yet to test it tonight.\n. You just have to download the branch and test it with a book that had the problem. \nStep by step:\n1. Click on \"white-flash-fix\" branch\n2. Click on ZIP and download it\n3. Open it and test with Xcode with a book that generated before the white flash\n. That's it! :)\nTry to play around a bit and stress it, but overall, that's it. :)\n. I'm sorry to do this, but please open a new issue to ask that ;)\n. If I got it correctly, that's a different issue. Check this closed support ticket: Issue #312\n. Excellent. We need to write that somewhere on the wiki :P\n. What do you mean by \"black fade\"? You mean fading from the black background?\n. If you are using three-cards, you're using more memory: that's why it's easier to see the slowness of UIWEbView.\n. Well, that's a possibility: the fade can be two things. One, is us doing actually the fade, the other is UIWebView that \"flashes\" content. I can't rule out one or the other, but with three cards that's surely a an increased probability. :)\n. You should always have a default book, so Baker shows something to the user.\nTo use the download feature,  you have to use the book:// protocol, check it here:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book-protocol\n:)\n. You're welcome. :)\nBtw, keep an eye on Issue #20, when that one is closed it means we added native support for multiple books. :)\n. It looks like the advertisments/sponsored toolbar that Google adds automatically.\nYou might be able to turn it off with some of the options specified here:\nhttp://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapOptions\nOr, try asking that question here:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/google-maps-js-api-v3?lnk=srg&hl=en\n. Baker should use the Newsstand features, but we have yet to implement any kind of integration. I'm afraid that you have to find a developer to add that feature yourself. :|\n. If you want to track our progress, you can keep an eye on Issue #100 ;)\n. Unfortunately we don't have time to work on an Android port as well, but we welcome anyone that is willing to collaborate with  us to provide that framework as well.\nThat port was made at the time of Baker 1.0, and has never been updated afaik.\nIf anybody is aware of an Android port, of of anyone willing to collaborate with us to do that, we'll be more than welcome! :)\n. Yep, precisely. ;)\n. Hi Anton, it's a feature that is going to be out of the box in the upcoming Baker 3.0, and currently you can test it from the master repository here on GitHub.\nBaker 3.0 implement the Hpub format 1.0 fully, so you'll be able to use the book.json syntax to specify these things. Check the two wiki pages here:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/hpub-specification\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters\n. I asked another user to create it to give proper credit, but I guess I have to create it... created: Issue #175.\nSo, yes, it's planned in 3.1. :)\n. ;)\n. Going live... :)\n. ...and done. :)\nWe are just missing a wiki page about how to package for downloads, but it's something we can prepare in the following days. :)\n. Baker uses just plain and standard HTML files. :)\n. If you test the hands-on tutorial you should understand better how it works, try it: http://bakerframework.com/tutorials/20/basic :)\n. As before, it's just a file, exactly the ones you read in the Tutorial. :)\nThe only difference is that the downloaded ones are inside a single zip (renamed .hpub) in order to be downloaded. I suppose we need to clarify that part a bit more. :)\n. If it's a PDF, Baker isn't your answer. You have to build a HTML5 publication to use Baker. :)\n. Hi!\nWhat version of Baker are you using? :)\n. This answer should be what you're looking for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1453711/reliably-opening-app-store-links-from-a-uiwebview :)\n. Nice. :)\n. I might add over Simbul's answer that from an interaction perspective the double-tap is already a standard, and we're not going to implement it unless there's a big change in the current interaction model: from Kindle to iBooks to every magazine the overlay is shown at double tap, and we are going to be consistent with that. :)\n. Sure: you can develop an alternative if you need it, there's absolutely no problem in doing that and if other people will find it useful it could be a good addition. :)\n. Yes. :)\nAs Simbul was saying above that feature is already planned, it's tracked in Issue #106. :)\n. Hi!\nThe Newsstand integration is a feature already requested, we are going to look into it for the next 3.1 release. Follow the Issue #100 for updates and feedback. :)\nIf you're able to developer that feature yourself and help us to do that, that would be awesome too. ;)\n. Nope, we just released the 3.0, and it's hard to tell when that is going to be released. :)\nHowever, if you start working, just keep us updated using the issue above. :)\n. We'll check. :)\n. I think you're talking about Issue #20. :)\nThis Issue refers to a demo page to show how downloaded books work. :)\n. The new assets for shelf are in, but we have to update them on iPhone since for now it's iPad only. This is now closely related to issue #519.\n. Hi @nin9creative I don't want to look too annoying but... could you open a separate issue for that? This was to track the in-app assets (background, icons, etc). :)\n\u2013\nOn the other side, I think the problem is somewhere in the code that takes the image at \"base resolution\" and scales it regardless if it's retina or not. It looks like the image is first read and resized at a \"standard\" resolution and then scaled up for retina, where the first scaling obliterates any advantage of using a higher-resolution image. That's however my guess... it might be something in the grid component  we are using, or some code that's missing, I don't know.\n. I don't know matchMedia so I can't really tell, however... if you are going to the extent of creating two pages, why don't you put BOTH the image maps on the page and use CSS to show / hide them? This will result in only one page with both and probably will spare you also time to manage only one page. :)\n. Check the latest demo book: the CSS there should be correctly working for portrait and landscape.\nHowever, it's strange, because items with display: none; shouldn't count for the page size. Did you try that or were you using some other CSS? :)\n. Wonderful :)\nThe difference is that visibility keeps the item on the page, just hides it, while display removes it from the page entirely. :)\n. That happens because Xcode doesn't clear the remote app when you do a new build.\nYou did correctly in cleaning the build folder and everything, the only missing step is removing as well the app on the iPad and compiling it again. \nThanks for pointing out, we are going to make this clearer in the tutorials. :)\n. Could you please give us more details on the crashes in Issue #199? Thanks! :)\n. Well, Baker 3.0 is built for iOS5, so that might be a problem. ;)\nThat said however, it's difficult to tell without any information from you about the error you're getting, the log file or at least something to try to pinpoint the problem. :)\nCould you add more details? :)\n. Ach, that sounds like a very tricky problem. :(\nDid you try another iPod Touch device? Maybe a friend's one?\nI'm afraid I can't help much on that...\n. It happens when you build on iOS 4.x, since Baker 3.0 is for iOS 5.\nCheck the answer to Issue #182. ;)\n. Follow issue #175 for an implementation of what you are asking. We are working on it right now. :)\nHowever, we won't take the screenshot when leaving the page, because right now we have evidence that it's better to reset always the position of the page at the start, and that's why we are taking the screenshot before.\nThe fact that the page in three-cards stays where it was is a sort of side-effect, not a feature we were looking for, and it doesn't last: once you move two pages forward, you will lose the position.\nWe're open to more evidence if the users prefer to keep the pages at a specific height, however, it's just that at this time it doesn't seem a requirement from the data we have. :) \n. Ok, from a quick test local:// is really file://, and however it's the same of just specifying a relative path, since file:// will require an absolute path and that will be quite hard on the sandboxed iOS environment.\n. Uhm I don't get the need of this: if the book supports only one alignment it will show up in that way: the user will simply turn the device. :)\nNo? Am I missing something? :)\n. Sure, just use the CSS media queries to re-compose your pages. :)\n. Yes, look up for any tutorial on CSS media queries. :)\n. I'm sorry, but I was thinking that you were referring to the same thing as the above where you wanted to just display a message. That's something done by media-queries.\nFor the orientation in JavaScript you can, as everything, check the HTML5 documentation, specifically window.orientation and window.onorientationchange. You'll find plenty of information on the web. :)\n. You should do the reverse: copy your Laker book/ folder inside Baker 3.0 book/ folder, and update what's necessary. You shouldn't touch anything from Baker 3.0 :)\nNotice that some things are different, for example Baker 3.0 now uses \"index.html\" to render the menu. :)\n. I did some tests. :)\nConverting Laker 1.1 to Baker 3.0 is quite straightforward:\n1. Download Laker 1.1 and Baker 3.0, unzip them\n2. Take the book/ folder from Laker 1.1 and put it in Baker 3.0\n3. Rename \"navigation.htm\" to \"index.html\"\n4. Copy the whole content of \"toc.html\" inside \"index.html\" replacing line 57 (div id includeTOC...)\n5. Add book.json following the Hpub specifications\n6. For the index to work correctly, add to book.json -baker-index-height = 200\nThat's it. It could probably be cleaned up a bit more, but in this way it should work. :)\n. Uhm the latest Xcode release is 4.2. We support that one. :)\n. Points 5 and 6 are how publications in Baker 3 are handled: Hpub. Read the specification from the wiki or the tutorial:\nTutorial: http://bakerframework.com/tutorials/30/manifest\nWiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/hpub-specification\nFor the single click, it's not possible, because:\n1. Every publication out there uses double-tap\n2. Single tap is used to trigger buttons and links\nSo we're not going to implement it, but feel free to implement it yourself. :)\n. Baker 3.0 incorporates all the changes from Laker and more.\nNow, from Laker the only parts you need are the ones inside book/, that needs to be adapted (as you can read above) to work with Baker 3.0. :)\nCheers! :)\n. Laker has been updated to version 1.2 with full Baker 3.0 support by the awesome @ffranke. :)\nMore info here: http://www.lakercompendium.com/2011/12/27/laker-1-2-and-a-few-notes/\n. Uhm I never encountered the idle time in my tests (and there's no such a thing in our code, afaik), what does it happen?\n. Yup, as I said we downloaded even bigger Hpubs but we never encountered that problem. Now it's clear, we'll check it out, thanks. :)\n. It's not possible right now from pure JavaScript, you'd have to implement some ObjectiveC bridge. But that's a good idea. :)\nI've added this as a feature. :)\n. Nope, it's a feature not present in Baker. Any update will be posted on this issue. ;)\n. I think that until we - or someone else with us - implements the communication bridge it's going to stay a bit hacky unfortunately. :)\n. I didn't test thoroughly that solution, so I can't really answer.\nThe bridge will be a solution involving Objective-C code, not just javascript. :)\n. The menu in Forgotten Colours is a custom development. :)\n. Well it's custom Objective-C code, you should ask them. The link is on our showcase. :)\n. Uhm we developed it bot on iPad 1 and 2, that's weird. We'll check. :)\nWith \"real pages\" you mean that it doesn't crash with the demo book, right? :)\n. Could you give us more details, like what's in the debug log when it crashes, or how to reproduce it?\nI tried laker with three-cards on and it doesn't seem to crash here on my iPad 1, is there anything different than the demo Laker package?\n. Thanks @mutador, but we need the source, not a released book to be able to debug it. WebKit is a hell to debug, unfortunately, and that's basically why we are in this situation. :)\n. Thanks. :)\n. I'm aware this is an old discussion, but I'm revisiting all the issues and I see that this one was still open. \nSo, was anyone able to track down the issue?\n. We don't test with the book in GitHub, we aren't so naive, come on! I'm a bit offended that you think so! ;) :D\nWe have a set of different books, magazines and test pages, mostly sent by users. So, please, if you can send us a demo magazine that doesn't work and triggers this bug, that would be great. Unfortunately our time is limited, and as such we really need the support of our users to try solve bugs. :)\n. I'm sorry I won't crack existing books to do tests, you understand. If you can send us a demo book fine, otherwise we'll need to spend some time ourselves to build one that triggers the problem. :)\n. LOL yes I know. Do I need a whole book? Couldn't you just send me one page that crashes? Or all the pages crash? :)\n. Thank you very much. :)\n. Send it at the official Baker email address: info@bakerframework.com. :)\n. Got it. Thanks. :)\nWe'll check during our next dev meeting on monday. :)\n. What does it happen if you change the mode to screenshot and you don't turn the app? Does it crashes? :)\n. Yeah: iPad 1 doesn't have enough memory unfortunately.\n. I'm not kidding you. Baker just loads a UIWebView and that's it, but it's not exactly the same as what you use in Mobile Safari for a series of different reasons.\nHowever of course it can be a bug in Baker. This thread specifically is about when you switch orientation, that's why I was asking to you if you can provide more information about when it crashes, with the maximum number of details you can provide, because otherwise it's impossible for us to guess where the problem can be.\nAbout that: if the action you are performing is an orientation change, then it's this bug. But since you told me that even without turning it crashes... please open a new one so we can track your one separately. :)\n. So let's see if I understood this well: the page with many images or a video loads and work correctly, but when you rotate it, it crashes.\nIs it correct?\n. Could you please provide an example Hpub book to test? :)\n. I just did the test above: I took the sample book, added \u4f60\u597d and it works, even if it doesn't display the characters correctly.\nTo display the characters correctly I had to add <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">, and with that works as well.\nWhat are you using to edit? Are you using Xcode? Or another editor? It might be a problem of encoding when saving the file itself.\n. @Mika are you using Laker? Laker uses an old version of Baker (2.0) that's why you couldn't find book.json. :)\n. Wow! I didn't know that using @ references created also notifications! Sorry! :)\n. That's strange. In none of our tests resulted in three-cards being lighter than screenshots. Could you give us an example?\n. As explained in the Laker topic, I did a quick conversion to adapt Laker and it worked for me, but indeed, it was built for Baker 2.0, not 3.0.\n@zenz: just to be completely sure: did you clean up everything, deleted the app and all before doing the test? Because in theory screenshots should work the other way: you should see the screenshot for about 1 second before the HTML is loaded... Could you check? :)\n. ...on the other side, I can't reproduce it, so we're stuck. :P\n. Thanks! That's good to know. :)\nI think everything specially designed for iPad and iPhone should work marvels with Baker, however there might be slight differences and it's great to get this feedback. :D\n. I'm cleaning up the issue tracker. So I'll close this old discussion. :)\n. All the page on the Wiki refer to the MASTER from GitHub, not the released version (3.0 currently).\nThat parameter was implemented in Issue #175, and will be released with Baker 3.1. :)\n. Yes, it's available in the current master, in development, source. No release date yet for 3.1, we are trying to clean up a bit more the source before release. :)\n. At this time there isn't a call for that, the only thing I might suggest you is to use the screenshot mode right now. \n. That's not odd: three-pages works that way: pre-loads page +1 and page -1 from the page you're looking, so when the page with the video is two steps behind... is shut down. :)\nCouldn't you use the screenshots mode? :)\n. Uhm ok, no then there's something I don't get either. I should see a demo book, if you're able to produce one without your content inside but that has the same behaviour. However, first, try screenshots. :)\n. Did you solve this? :)\n. So... did you solve it with screenshots mode? :)\nIn other terms, we implemented custom events in Issue #225, have a look, it's another way that allows you to solve this issue since you should be able to control players off-screen. :)\n. Yes, it's possible.\nYou should refer to Apple documentation regardin Ad-Hoc distribution. :)\nIt should be on Apple SDK documentation, but you should be able to google around for it too. For example: \nhttp://diaryofacodemonkey.ruprect.com/2011/03/18/ad-hoc-app-distribution-with-xcode-4/\n. You're welcome :)\n. Oh, nice! That's a self-solving issue, wonderful :D\nKeep us informed on your release. :)\n. That tells me you are using the latest unreleased master and not the 3.0 release :D\nThat's going to be the default, but you can turn off that behaviour, more informations here: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-support\n. I'm really sorry, but it's probably better if you ask this question on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/iphone or another generic iOS SDK development forum, we can't really help in implementing specific requests, otherwise we won't be able to develop Baker.\nI'm sorry.\n. That's really hard to debug... do you have a demo book to reproduce the issue? The full log? Something? :)\n. You mean http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/ ?\nIt seems nice. We'll consider it. :)\n. @zenz as you can see we can't yet look into it. Did you already implement this somewhere or are you able to contribute this code? Or, in other terms, what are the advantages that we could get out of it? :)\n. It's not there and unfortunately it's a bit difficult to implement with the current architecture. But we'll keep this issue open to track it and see if it's possible - or of someone implements it.\nThanks :)\n. Reviewing this, we feel it's a bit outside the scope of the framework, so we are closing the issue. If someone wants to implement this however we could give it a try and see if we can merge it into master.\n. Hello @Jacky1212,\nThe reason it's difficult is because the gesture is fully managed right now by a UIScrollView and implementing curl requires a complete rewrite of that part.\nThat said, there's already someone else that is trying to do it, check issue #529 and maybe contact the author. :)\n. This is a duplicate of the request on Issue #100, I'll close this one. :)\n. Is this complete? Any solution you found working that might be useful to someone else? :)\n. I think that this page on the wiki should be able to answer your questions:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book-protocol\nHowever, it's something that works inside a Baker book: you have to add the links there :)\nFor the full multi-issue support, check for Issue #20 to be completed. :)\n. Well, as I said that's related to Issue #20 for us, but if you want you should be able to create a JavaScript library to check the server and report any update. :)\n. There's no file: read the discussion ;)\n. What do you want to do exactly, that's not possible by adding a index.html and double-tapping? :)\n. Were you able to find a solution for this?\n. Duplicate of Issue #221. I'm closing this one. :)\n. We just added this book to our Showcase. Excellent work! :)\n. We mean exactly that, but I agree, the naming of the original example is ambiguous. :)\n. We are implementing the following two, so we should be as standards compliant as possible:\nwindow.focus\nwindow.blur\n. As an example of implementation:\nwindow.addEventListener(\"focus\", function() { ... }, true);\nwindow.addEventListener(\"blur\", function() { ... }, true);\nWhere inside the two functions you can handle the focus and blur of the page. :)\n. Try this as a test: replace the current book with the default book, and see if it does work again.\nUnfortunately that error is too generic, do you have any debug console log that you can give us?\n. Did you change the title? It seems it's failing in loading the title tag of the page.\nCheck:\n1. The title tag\n2. If you are saving the file in UTF-8, just to be sure.\nIf it still doesn't work, please link here the book it's not working. :)\n. I'll try to answer quickly:\n- UTF8: it should be possible to use any format, but UTF8 is a way to ensure everything's correct.\n- Extra files: if it's not in the ToC, it shouldn't trigger any problem.\n- Rename: what do you mean? If you rename it you'll just update the book.json and that's all. :)\n. Did you solve this?\n. Thanks to you for taking time to add a solution! :)\n. Does someone know the author of Friar? We just discovered it and we'd like to contact him to ask if he wants to support the Baker Android port, officially. :)\n~\n@ayarmanqu that looks awesome. :) We'll check. :)\nCould you provide us a voucher so we can see if we can add it to the showcase? :) Cheers!\n. @barrytallis thanks. :)\n. Jorge, let me tell this: you are a genius. :)\nThat's an incredible workaround. Kudos. :)\n. We'll check. Thanks :)\n. I don't understand the solution your code above is providing. Why http://local?\nCould you explain the steps you are following in detail, where it fails, and what should it do instead?\n. Uhm ok, I see the problem. :)\nIt's this:\n2. set target's URL scheme to book(baker's source didn't set this).\nBecause this will break any other Baker book out there: you'll app will try to open every book linked anywhere.\nIt's ok if you want to build a general reader for Hpub books, but it's not if it's your own book, you'll just create a bad experience for book users... and you'll book will be removed with no way to come back. :)\n. Yes, please avoid using book if you're not creating a generic reading app. ;)\nThat said: book://local is meant to work only from inside a book, since there's no \"local\" in an external book. If you want to revert to the default book from an external link, I think you should build a specific protocol and call yourself, different from \"local\". :)\n. The protocol book://should be a standard, generic protocol. \nbook://local, instead, is a way to tell Baker to workaround a specific limitation that we hope to remove in a future version. So yes, it's only an internal thing. :)\n. As far as I know, and for a few publications that had problem in the past and published here, to past through that is usually as simple as adding a few animation all over the book. In the book I saw rejected and then accepted they just added things like eyes blinking or tiny movement in some illustrations, and that was enough to pass the approval.\n. Ok, that's new. :|\n@psmedia Just a question: in your app were you downloading a book? Or it was just a single issue? I'm asking this just to narrow down the problem.\n@zenz I don't think it's so easy. We had to relocate it already a couple of times, plus, the book is inside the app, not in any other folder. There are however a few things that might have triggered that issue: downloaded book and screenshots, for example.\nWe'll look into it asap. :)\n. @psmedia thanks. So it's probably an issue with the screenshot mode. :)\n@zenz Yes. It's probably due to the change in iOS 5.0.1. One of the problem we found in 5.0 was that our data shouldn't expire and shouldn't be either backed up, that's why we had that problem. \nThanks for the source! If you have time for testing, why don't you make the patch and push it to Baker's repo? :)\n. Awesome! :D\n. Do you mean having each page exactly of the right vertical size, so there's no scroll down?\n. Uhm I don't get however why do you have to change anything, just put each page after the other and make the navigation point only to the first pages of each chapter, like Forgotten Colours do, no? :)\nMaybe, adding the -baker-vertical-bounce: false flag: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters :)\n. ;)\n. May I ask what's the concrete advantage? Smaller executable or cleaner code? :)\nIf you think it's an improvement we should make, just prepare a branch on GitHub and push it to the main branch ;)\n. Are you willing to try? In that way your work will be clearly attributed to you and it will be incredibly easier for us to test it: http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/ :)\n. I don't know if it fits your needs, but you can enable the \"zoomable\" property of Hpub, out of the box: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/hpub-specification ;)\n. That's nice! :)\nThanks :D\n(still no luck at figuring out push? no worries than, we'll add your name in the commit) :D\n. What do you mean by the handling for pre-made screenshot? :)\n. Good point. But if you upload screenshots at retina resolution, doesn't that solve the problem? What's the solution then?\n. That's clear now. I suppose we could use the @2 standard naming that Apple is using for retina as well. :)\n. Yes, certainly. :)\nThat feature is actually a temporary add-on, we really hope to be a stop-gap while the WebView gets less buggy, but of course, it might be worth the effort to support these variations. :)\n. Done! Thanks :D\n. Maybe it's a matter of sizing: did you try specifying the size of the index in book.json? :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters\n-baker-index-height. :)\n. You're welcome! :)\n. A-W-E-S-O-M-E-!\nWe'll check! :D\n. Note: this refers to Issue #239 and #237.\n. That's VERY good to know. :)\nI suppose that Edge performance still needs some finetuning, and it might even be something about the performance of UIWebView vs Mobile Safari.\nDid you test the same thing in Mobile Safari as well, just to have an additional perfomance check?:)\n. Just because while it's the same engine that powers Baker, it has some differences that might impact acceleration, so, if you test in Mobile Safari and it runs smoothly, it means that it's just the acceleration is missing from UIWebView and we need to wait Apple. Instead, if it doesn't run smoothly in Mobile Safari as well, it might be probably worth waiting for Adobe update instead of Apple. Just that. :)\n. I'm cleaning up the issue tracker. I'll close this old discussion. :)\n. Uhm, I'm not sure. We'll check. :)\n. Yup, you should be able to load a page (the one that will be displayed if online) and then modify it when it finds a connection. :)\n. Did anyone write successfully this javascript code in the end? :)\n. Could you please clarify? :)\n. Sure, there are lots of informations on the web on the possible touch events on Mobile Safari. :)\nFor example: \nhttp://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/\n. So, as a summary for future readers before closing this issue:\n- -webkit-tap-highlight-color changes the color of the interactive tapped element.\n- ::selection pseudo-class instead allows changing the color of the selected highlight. However mind that this is not in the CSS3 specification, and so it's just supported by the browsers by themselves.\n. Please, always try to break down functionalities in small chunks. Today, we have already the whole path for Magazines laid down, in order:\n1. Shelf: Issue #20\n2. Newsstand full support: Issue #100\nIf you need more features after these, break them down into specific issues, so people can vote and contribute to them, and we as the Baker team can prioritize and version them. :)\n. Well you can do exactly the same thing that they did in Baker. :)\nHowever, that's a publication feature, not a Baker feature. You don't need to add features to Baker to do that, you just have to include a simple JavaScript on the page. It could probably even be a Google Ad if you really want to. :)\nIt's quite simple. :)\n. Uhm I might be missing something, but:\n1. If it's a small variation, you can just show a default ad, and if the user is connected you download the latest update ad. You also might be able to store the update using things like localstorage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage\n2. If it's a big variation, you just ping the server and if there's an update you download the latest Hpub package.\nBoth of them are already possible today.\nWe might think to provide a more reliable solution than localstorage, but I didn't test the localstorage permanence itself, so it might be already enough. :)\n. About your message above for the browser inside Baker, there's already an open issue for that: Issue #119. ;)\n. Yes, that's what I meant by \"small\", point 1. :)\n. Uhm it's really strange, because well... it works on the web and Baker just uses WebKit. If you have the source code of the javascript library you wrote I might be able to give you some pointers about that. That's because with JS you should have all the tools to check serverside the updates and pull them down plus storing them with localstorage. If that doesn't work, well, I think that we are facing a bigger problem than that, because it means that the UIWebView is less capable than Safari Mobile.\nIt might be that localstorage isn't working well but... I'd have expected the opposite: losing the updated data, not its persistence. Or problems from the security sandbox, like this one:\nhttp://forrst.com/posts/Security_err_dom_exception_18_and_how_to_avoid-1Ge\nCould you send us the JS you tried to use? Or is it too sensitive/private to have another pair of eyes looking at that?\n. Regarding the first and partially third and fourth point, check the branch shelf here on github. We have already started that and the work is in progress as you can see on the Issue #20. :)\n. I think the main issue right now is that a lot of people are working on these features but without any coordination, either here or elsewhere, to come up with a single solution we could merge in the main tree. @killer1loop proposal is interesting because he wants to form a team to work on these features, solving that. :)\n. @nin9creative you're correct: we split Baker from being a single app to BakerViewController to make it modular during our work in Issue #59. :)\nPlease if you discuss keep the conversation going here (and on Issue #20) as well. ;)\n. The basic version is exactly where we are headed with the currenet branch SHELF, have a look. ;)\n. Yes: check the milestones at the top of this page on GitHub to check the progress for the next release.\nThe branch is currently in development, so I can't really highlight what's in and what's out, but the milestone 4.0 should be a good approximation: basically, we are addressing Issue #20. :)\nIt's ready for testing, but it's not yet in beta: not all the features to have a workable shelf are implemented (however, we are following some of the choices made by @nin9creative and @mpena2099). :)\nFollow Issue #20 for updates. :)\n. Great news Andrew! :)\n. I quickly read your code and it seems you're not setting an expiry date for it! :)\nWithout expiry date, it will be killed straight off.\nHave a read: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html\n. I'm cleaning up the issue tracker, so I'm closing this issue. If the problem re-surfaces, please re-open this issue without any trouble. :)\n. Great, thanks! :D\n. I'm cleaning up the issue tracker, so I'm closing this issue. If the problem is still there, please feel fee to re-open this. :)\n. We won't add this as a parameter, otherwise porting a book to a reader to another might break it. :)\nPlus, we added the parameter in this way so it's trackable by our analytics tool that the source was Baker. :)\nWhy did you want to change it?\n. Let's make a step back: why? What was the problem? :)\n. \"Any url it doesn't recognize gets redirected to our homepage.\"\nWow, that's incredibly naive, since it's not a page but a parameter! I might be wrong, but they aren't following the URL definition standard with that choice.\nDo you have an URL that behaves in that way so I can test it?\n. Fantastic. We used a standard name thinking that no application would use that name for anything else apart for the referrer itself, and it happens that instead they are using it for everything but referrers! :D\nThe irony. :)\nWell, we then need to find another solution.\nThe starting point for me would be something like:\nhttp://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=55578\nThat could translate to:\nhttp://www.example.com/?utm_source=baker&utm_medium=ipad&utm_campaign=book\nBut at that time we felt it was too long.\nNOTE: We'd love to use the target=\"_blank\" attribute, but unfortunately it's not handled by the Objective-C delegate. :|\n. I'm all for minimalistic solutions. ;)\nThis unfortunately is something we can't parametrize at code level, because it will then generate incompatible books between versions and readers.\nAny other idea? I think we are a bit brainstorming here so the more feedback the better. :)\n. I'd avoid src, since it's again a common tech word and even more used than referrer, and if that's was a problem I don't want to be back again on this. Also because one of the private discussion I had is a mis-configured .htaccess that redirects any ?parameter.\nIt might be possible to use the #id part of the URL, we'll look into that. :)\nAs for the reason why, that's exactly the assumptions that Hpub books need to be portable that we should try to avoid that. :)\n. We tried a few different solutions, but right now the only one that worked in all the situations was the one that removed \"referrer=Baker\" before calling the external webserver.\nNow that's the current behaviour.\nCommitted right now. :)\n. About the book, I should have a look at your book/ folder to tell you what was going on.\nAbout the tutorial, I'm not aware of any, sorry.\n. Wow that's not slow, that's incredibly slow.\nHowever I really have no idea about the origin of that bug. It seems related to something within UIWebView, so it's a bit outside our possibilities I think.\nHowever, let's see...\nWhat size is that image?\n(btw thanks for the AMAZING bug report, that's one of the best I've ever seen)\n. @joshbaltzell Thanks, you're doing a great debugging work. :)\nBut did it do the same on the device as well? :)\n. I never found that out, but it might well be: the UIWebView in the Simulator is similar but not the same of the one shipping on the actual device, they perform differently and sometimes they have slight differences popping up.\nI never encountered that problem myself, so I can't tell, but that would be my guess, yes.\n. I'm cleaning up the issue tracker, so I'm closing this issue. If the problem re-surfaces, please re-open this without any trouble. :)\n. Uhm that's weird. I guess we could optimimize that part of the code for sure, but first: did you try removing a few of them and see if there's a number around which reliably it crashes?\n. ...what's in the log when it crashes? :)\n. Now the screenshots are handled better, we introduced some complexity but it should avoid crashes for screenshot mode plus big books. Kudos to @Xm4s.\nThere are two internal variables added with Commit 8a30fc6bff5e4dd3db68d774fc2ec854a4fc68e9.\n```\n// SCREENSHOT\ndefine MAX_SCREENSHOT_AFTER_CP  10\ndefine MAX_SCREENSHOT_BEFORE_CP 10\n```\nThis allows to change the number of screenshots pre-loaded. If you swipe very quickly more than this number, the usual spinner appears.\nWe might have to finetune the two numbers above to avoid crashes, but, overall, this works. Issue closed. :)\n. I would advise against it, because one of the values of creating HTML pages and not images or native is exactly that people can copy and paste.\nHowever, if you really, really, really want it, it's what we wrote in Issue #96: \nIt should be this CSS command, put together by @usaps: \n```\nbody {\n    margin: auto;\n    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: #d3f9f2\n/* Disable selection/Copy of UIWebView */\n-webkit-touch-callout: none;\n-webkit-user-select: none;\n\n}\n```\nI guess, that the best solution would be if you can apply this rule only to buttons and interactive elements, keeping the ability to select and copy text intact. :)\nSource:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/923782/disable-the-text-highlighting-magnifier-on-touch-hold-on-mobile-safari-webkit\n. Yup, just disable Newsstand here following the instructions from the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-support\nYou just have to turn a flag off.\nIt's a good idea since it seems that Apple requires a full implementation of Newsstand and if you can't include it, it's better to turn it off (we are going to fix that soon). :)\n. Hi @mutador, I'm cleaning up a bit the issue tracker so I'll close this old message since nobody answered. \nI'd say: if the technique works, go for it. ;)\n. I created a wiki page from the libraries suggested here:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Libraries-for-baker\n. Check Apache as well, because it's receiving a response, but it's a 404, it means that Apache is responding... from Apache log you should be able to get another piece of information.\n. Wow, that's interesting. We need to do some test ourselves now. :o\n. This looks excellent! Give us time to test it and I think that it will be merged immediately. :D\n. Great! Thank you :D\n. Excellent, thank you so much. :)\n. I like so much self-solving problems. :)\n@nurtext, if you have any other problem we are here. ;)\n. We are going to do our weekling progress meeting next monday, we had to skip this week for personal problem, mostly translatable in \"impact from coming back from holiday\". We'll check it on monday evening. :)\n. I can give you three pointers:\n1. Did you try on Mobile Safari - without Baker. Does it do the same?\n2. It seems a Mobile problem more than a Baker problem, did you try asking on StackOverflow?\n3. It seems that you are controlling everything via JavaScript. Then... why are you creating DOM elements? Why don't you just:\nvar a = new Audio(\"file.m4a\");\na.play();\nThat's all, I hope it helps... :)\n. That's fascinating! :o\n. Sure, but you have to manually edit Baker. Open RootViewController.m, find the function downloadBook (around line 1373) and replace this:\nmessage:[OPEN_BOOK_MESSAGE stringByAppendingFormat:@\"%@?\", URLDownload]\nTo probably something like:\nmessage:@\"Do you want to download the book?\"\nHowever, be careful with that, because the user will not have anymore any indication of what's being downloaded. :)\n. Send to the Baker email address: info@bakerframework.com :)\n. That's depressing. Thanks for the report @nin9creative. \n. Any update will be posted here, so... no, no news. If you check the Milestones above, you'll see that right now we are working on everything else to have Newsstand in place first, release it, and then we could start looking at it. ;)\n. I'm closing this issue since there is no answer. Feel free to reopen it if you'd like to continue. :)\n. Mind that the solution might not exist: from the message above it seems you are using an iPhone 3G with an old OS version, that means that there might not be enough RAM to allow it to run, and unfortunately we won't be able to test it on that hardware.\nComment and re-open this issue when you are ready. :)\n. I agree... but I can also see that sometimes you really want to make it work, so I understand your effort as well. That's great. :)\nKeep us updated. :)\n. You have to start with some Xcode tutorial: the process of creating an app with Baker is the same of creating an app with Xcode, Apple's standard tool. Check their documentation, tutorial and guidelines.\nOn Baker's side, you can read this tutorial: http://bakerframework.com/tutorials/30/basic :)\n. It's the last part of that tutorial: \"Publish on the Apple Store\". :)\n. Uhm probably I'm not understanding where you're stuck. From the tutorial page:\n1. You have to prepare the application from the iTunes Connect website.\n2. You have to create the compiled application for Release, following the instruction from the iOS Provisioning Portal under Distribution.\n3. You have to upload the compiled application.\nDid you already do part 1 and 2 of that part of the tutorial, following all the Apple instructions to prepare the application for publishing? Where are you stuck?\n. Ok...\nLet's see... I think you're missing some steps from the Apple tutorial: once Xcode built for Releaase, you have an ipa ready to be uploaded, the tutorial should have told you that.\nThat said... there's an alternative way to do that. Try following this other tutorial, where you Build and Archive and you use Organized to upload to iTunes Connect:\nhttp://www.weston-fl.com/blog/?p=2442\nMore info on that method on the official documentation here:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/DistApps/DistApps.html\n. You're welcome.\nIf this tutorial works, please come back and tell us, so we can see if we can update our tutorial as well. :)\n. Sure, have a look here and tell us if it works:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Publish-on-ipad-and-iphone\n. Ah I'm sorry! I meant that I added it when you asked the question, that's why you didn't see it. It wasn't there, it is now thanks to your feedback. :)\n. I don't think we are going to implement it, sorry. I believe that to provide a good experience you have to support the reader at your best and downscaling isn't really a great solution for the reader.\nBut of course, feel free to add that feature yourself if you want to. :)\n. Well, you can do all with the media-queries, just select the right image via CSS and display it. Also, most of the time you don't even need to do that if you just resize the image properly: since the image is already there and you don't have bandwidth constraint, it will just work.\nOtherwise there are other techniques like JavaScript replacement. All of these and a lot of tutorials should be available if you search around the keyword \"responsive design\". :)\n. You have to write that custom code by yourself, it's not in there by default. However, you can just add padding on the iPhone when it's turned. ;)\n. A single Hpub works as a single book, with just horizontal swiping and vertical scrolling. There aren't multiple levels. :)\nBaker uses a different model from Our Choice, where the \"status bar\" is really the content itself. the page itself. You can simulate quite easily in JavaScript however: just add another scroller on the \"chapter\" page and zoom in on touch. :)\n. It's really hard to tell what's happening. Does your page intercept touch events? What's displaying? What's in the logs? :)\n. Ahh! Sorry, I misread it.\nIt doesn't work in Safari because these are only your pages. The way you do that is by building an index page that works well as the starting page and each other page is linked to that, so you can read it. :)\n. Yes: it's HTML, there's no swiping on HTML pages. :)\nBut as you can see you can build an index page with media-queries and click to the specific page, allowing your book to be readable on the web with minimal effort.\nOr, you might want to add some kind of javascript library helping the user to navigate between pages. Up to you. :)\n. Hi @lithos77 I'm closing this issue since there are no new developments, but if you come back please feel free to reopen it and go ahead with the discussion. :)\n. Did you try using screenshot mode? :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters\n. For information, why did you like it? :)\nHowever, the implementation of Issue #225 will solve your problem when it's ready. :)\n. Are you using the right Distribution certificate? I don't think you can use the Developer certificate. However it's probably better if you ask feedback on Apple Dev forums or in the Xcode part of Stackoverflow. :)\n. Have a look at TestFlight then, you might find it VERY useful, and it has also tutorials to help you:\nhttp://testflightapp.com\n. If they do something like that, it will be along the lines of what we did with this project, and it will be great. We released this because of our vision for the iPad to be a great digital book platform, and if Apple does that for everyone, with the skills and resources they can execute with, it would be great. :)\nAs for your question, I really don't like to add hypothesis to rumors. ;)\n. iBooks 2:\nhttp://t.co/rpFKxeTJ\niBooks Author:\nhttp://t.co/diou3p0M\nThey look wonderful. :)\n. Hey don't deviate every discussion about that! :D\nSpend time finding developers if you need it. :D :D :D\n. Not exactly, even if it's still weird: http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/19/unprecedented\n. - EPub3 is a new standard (october 2011) with no real backing as of today and with a very specific focus \"The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout\", so it means: no precise pagination, layout or else. You have no control and it's their will: http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/#sec-access-layout.\n- iBook 2 uses a set of proprietary over EPub3, making it a format that's not anymore EPub3... exactly to compensate the lacking parts of the EPUb3 standard above. What puzzles me is why they didn't use HTML, but that's another question.\n- HTML5 is a universal web standard that supports both flowing and not flowing text, precise pagination, has the widest and most developed market existing today and developer tools, plus the engine is already ready and updated out of the box by Apple. HPub is just a zip of this.\nThere's no question. :)\n. There's an easier way:\n1. Click on \"Code\" in the top menu\n2. Click on the \"Current Branch\" dropdown menu\n3. Click on the branch you want, in this case \"tiled-screenshots\"\n4. Click on \"Zip\" to download the last commit of that branch only\nThis is faster for testing, but of course if you want to play around with the code and the branches @Zenz suggestion is better. :)\n. Since this was a too popular request, with the latest commit (f770bb9575aa66bc1ba71ce9786d5418800afd5c) we added a way to disable page turns with both tap, swipe or both.\nIn book.json now you can use also:\n-baker-page-turn-tap\n-baker-page-turn-swipe\nWe also updated the wiki page.\n. Did that fix work? :)\n. @bahmet that comment refers to 10 months ago, it was about Baker 3.1, there was a huge rework in 3.2 and 4.0. Overall we still advise to not disable double tap. :)\n. As I said before, I'd advise you to avoid that if you aren't absolutely sure because users will expect that behaviour. Think twice before disabling it, it might translate to a very bad user experience. :)\n. Since this was a too popular request, with the latest commit (f770bb9575aa66bc1ba71ce9786d5418800afd5c) we added a way to disable page turns with both tap, swipe or both.\nIn book.json now you can use also:\n-baker-page-turn-tap\n-baker-page-turn-swipe\nWe also updated the wiki page.\n. Baker uses HTML: just use the same techniques you'd use in HTML: CSS media queries. :)\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\n. @morands so, you mean that by building the book as portrait only, then playing a video and then turning the iPad, the video doesn't turn?\n. It seems that the code we use to handle the screen rotation influences the video as well.\nIt seems there's something to detect the video entering and exiting full screen, but it's on javascript side. I should try to see if there's an equivalent on Objective-C side. It might be possible, but unfortunately it requires some research and rework.\n. I asked the question on Stackoverflow, to double check: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9473688/detect-when-a-html5-video-runs-full-screen-from-objective-c\n. I'm afraid that question didn't have any answer and as such is probably either impossible today or too complex to achieve. Sorry. :(\n. That's a very nice resource zenz. Are you using that? :)\n. And, if I'm not too bold, do you think you could write a couple of lines, here or somewhere else, on how do implement that for Baker? :P\n. Awesome @zenz! \nYes, it looks quite simple. No gotchas. :)\nThanks. :)\n@nin9creative The problem with Push notifications is exactly the server side of things. I don't want to rely on a pay system, and I can't find a well packaged and reliable opensource server solution to interface build. The one pointed out above seems the nearest thing to it. It's rough, but it might work. :)\n. It's tracked already by issue #225, not implemented yet, but you can contribute on that topic. :)\n. Given we are having problem with even simple screenshots, it's probably way too heavy. :/\n. ;)\n. - Did you try again more recently with the latest master and Laker version?\n- Does it happen reliably each time you get a memory warning? \n. Do you have any news?\n. You're correct. It's a typo. :)\n. Thanks. :)\n. It's a good question. Ad you got correctly, it's related to the download of a book, but that's a consequence, not a requirement. :)\nThe first and main usage is being able to uniquely refer to a specific book.\nThink of it as an ISBN.\nIn fact, URL, or better, URI, means \"Uniform Resource Identifier\". It identifies uniquely a resource, and that's also the grounding of having an ISBN. So, by default, it provides:\n- Uniqueness\n- Findability\n- De-duplication of content\nThe difference from ISBN is that by using a URL we can add way more informations:\n- It could be a link to download the book\n- You could show the author and publisher\n- You can version it\n- You can provide different types of book formats\nThis is a critical feature to have to organize information, to locate information and to tell apart one book from another without doing a static analysis on the book as a whole.\nSo, yes, use your own URL, even if there's no file to download. :)\nP.S.: Baker internally relies on that unique identifier to tell two books apart, and the standard Hpub requires that as well. If you use an already used URL, it might generate in the future bad overlapping situations where the user won't be able to download a new book because \"it's already downloaded\", given the same URL. And so on, you can think lots of situations where not using a proper URL can lead to bad user experience and technical problems.\n. Yep. :)\nWhat do you mean by show author and publisher? :)\n. Ah! Now I got it. By \"specify author or publisher\" I meant that you could build an URL like:\nbook://publisher.org/author/book-name/edition.hpub\nIn this way, you see that the URL is incredibly meaningful. :)\n. assets/ is an example. You can place it wherever you want in the Hpub folder. It's not a requirement right now, but if you don't have that by the time we implement the shelf, we will use a default image on the shelf instead of your cover. ;)\n. It's hard to tell right now. Try to put in a good sized image that looks like a book cover with the same proportions of the iPad. The Hpub standard doesn't put any limit, except, yes, PNG. :)\n. I'd just advise to don't replicate the paranoia that the music and movie labels have. A simple system will always trump any piracy, and no system will ever trump piracy completely,ever. It's a balance between the two.\nAnything can be copied. It's just a matter of effort. They could copy your magazine 1:1 without ever looking at the code and you'll have the same problem as having the code stolen.\nSo: create good content, market it well and find the right price, and you won't have to worry. :)\n. Well, you know, I could easily copy any website in the world... right? j/k ;)\nMore seriously: did you try doing the same on an Adobe publication? :)\n. It's a discussion worth raising, it's just also as important giving it the proper size and context. :)\nSo did you try? What's the output? XML? :)\n. Ok, as expected. Everything is in clear, but since it's a proprietary \"precomposed\" format nobody will do much with it. :)\nAs for Baker, it's surely possible to implement some kind of cryptography, but I'm not sure if it's worth the time, since somewhere in the distributed app the decoding key needs to exist, and as such... anyone will still be able to steal it.\nOtherwise, you could take the Adobe approach as well: limit the interactivity of your publication and flatten out everything by taking full-page screenshots. The downside of this is the same as Adobe: limited interactivity and increased app size.\nI can't think of many other solutions...\n. That's a really old article there! :)\nBaker since version 3.0 has two different modes to decrease latency:\nhttp://bakerframework.com/log\nThere are two modes: screenshot and three-cards. You can read more about it here:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Baker-rendering-modes\nBy default it uses screenshots, and you can make this even faster if you provide the initial screenshots in the book itself, otherwise Baker will do it by itself.\nUnfortunately, it's a limit of the software stack provided by Apple and the hardware itself. Any publishing framework that tries to provide the same quality and flexibility of Baker has the same problems, and they all try to address the problem with different kinds of workaround. The problem is less visible on iPad 2 and we expect to be even less on future versions. :)\nThe problem with the books out there is that we have no way to know which version they use: any version before 3.0 will have the loading issue, and after 3.0 the responsiveness depends if they are using three-cards or screenshot, that's why you still find books that sport the loading behaviour. And even that, some authors prefer that to other solutions.\n. Yes, check the showcase:\nhttp://bakerframework.com/books\nI can't point directly to books made in that way, since as I said before they don't disclose the version of Baker they are using, but you should find them quite easily there. :)\n. You should refer to the device screen size and create an HTML page and/or image that fits it perfectly.\nSizes:\n- iPhone: 480 \u00d7 320 px\n- iPad:  1024 \u00d7 768 px\n(note also that on iPhones with Retina display you can use more advanced CSS techniques to achieve pixel perfection). :)\n. Sure. That requires some kind of JavaScript. You can find plenty of code examples around the web, from the most basic to the more advanced ones. For example:\n- http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay/index.html\n- http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1823-adding-a-page-overlay-in-javascript/\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/873184/javascript-image-overlay-over-a-specified-div\nOf course, if you need to do something really custom, then you should probably learn a bit more about javascript/css itself and code it by yourself. :)\n. What do you want to protect exactly?\n. Well, it's a very custom requirement you have there, and right now it's not something that Baker can do. If you don't require a separate payment (since that will be against Apple policies) you could build an app yourself that does that. It could even be that you show first a login page on Baker and then you do everything from remote on the server - authentication and such - and then you allow the download of the books. All remote.\nI'm afraid we can't do much more at this time.\n. Well, if you have no experience then it's better to use the App Store... and actually, that's almost your only choice if you release payment based apps.\n. Thanks @mutador for the notification, you are doing one of the best Baker magazines out there. :)\nI'm so happy for its development and I hope to be able to provide you a few more features soon. ;)\nI'll however close this issue since almost one month has passed. :)\n. It's not very simple unfortunately, you have to remove a bit of code from very different parts of the source. I think you want to remove also the scroll when you tap, am I right?\nFor the tap, you have to comment out the relevant code inside - (void)userDidTap:(UITouch *)touch ([self changePage:page]).\nFor the scroll, you have to add scrollView.scrollEnabled = NO in initBookProperties and set it in lockPage and scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation.\nOr...\n. ...you can check the latest commit (f770bb9575aa66bc1ba71ce9786d5418800afd5c), done right now on master, that adds:\n-baker-page-turn-tap\n-baker-page-turn-swipe\nAs properties that you can use in book.json.\n. It's quite simple to achieve that, it should be done in javascript. There are a few libraries and examples out there. A good one is this: http://djpate.com/2009/10/07/animated-scroll-to-anchorid-function-with-jquery/\nIn general, if you google around with queries like \"jquery scroll to anchor\" or \"javascript smooth scroll anchor\" you'll find what you are looking for. :)\n. Well of course. Use it if you prefer. :)\n. Uhm... wait. We are probably not understanding each other. The scroll is a simple javascript as I linked above. What are you asking exactly? Could you explain it better if it's not a simple smooth scrolling? :)\n. Ok, now I probably got it. :)\nLet's do one step back first: Laker is PURE HTML/JS/CSS, there's nothing in there that's not doable on the web. On the other side, Baker doesn't do anything inside the page itself. There's a clear split. :)\nSo, I guess that you are referring to... the standard vertical pagination of Baker, that happens on the edge of the screen, regardless of the book. That's managed in Baker, there's no tie at all with Laker (even less with \"dossier-headline-arrow\") \u2014 Florian just did a smart thing and put the arrow under Baker's active area. It's an Objective-C animation, specifically goDownInPage and goUpInPage.\nAn Objective-C animation that behaves like the standard JavaScripts you can find on the web. ;)\nThis means that you can simply use JavaScript and do it, because using Objective-C would be a bit overkill for that. :)\n. Thanks George. ;)\nAnd wow, it seems you are doing a pretty huge work there! :)\nSo, about your issue, could you clear me out first what version are you using? The latest MASTER from GitHub, or the latest version from the website (3.1)?\nA thing that you can check immediately, is the real size of the index you are loading. If you use floats and similar it might be that the Objective-C side of things can't read correctly the size. Try to set body width and/or height in CSS first, and see if something changes. :)\n. Uhm ok, we need to look into it. What was the last version working for you?\n(is there also any way that you could send us your index.html?)\n. info@bakerframework.com :)\n. That's expected: the size of the HTML is what makes the index view size, while the book.json is there as a \"fallback\". :)\nSee the wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Adding-an-Index-Bar-to-your-publication\nWe should see if we can make the book.json parameter more \"effective\", maybe.\n. Or, it might also be that you are asking about the Developer Account, so I suggest you to register as an iOS developer and check out Apple's documentation on how to do that. :)\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action\n. This is issue #119. :)\nWe received contrasting opinion on its usefulness right now, so it's quite low in priority. It shouldn't be a difficult contribution however, if someone wants to try to do that. :)\n. Yes, but as above, please feedback on issue #119 ;)\n. Sure: just create one html for each page, with height as the height of the screen and disable the bounce: -baker-vertical-bounce. :)\nIs this what you asked for? :)\n. Baker doesn't do that, since its main purpose is to give you design control on each page and that requires the simplicity of the concept 1 page = 1 html.\nHowever I guess that you could build a script to do that, after a certain number of words it will split it and create multiple HTML pages. :)\n. Some basic questions just to be sure and aligned, then I have to test it a bit more thoroughly if these doesn't work:\n1. What version of baker are you using? MASTER or 3.1?\n2. Did you try moving referrer=Baker at the end? http://www.teos.fi/fi/kirjat/index.php?sub=2&id=367&referrer=Baker\n. Ok, we need to test this one then...\n. Ok, tested.\nI tried <a href=\"http://www.teos.fi/fi/kirjat/index.php?sub=2&id=367&referrer=Baker\"> and it seems working correctly. From the log above it seems that you weren't using the last source. It might be that you compiled it, updated and never did a cleanup. Try doing a clean and compile again with the latest master. :)\nHowever I noticed a bug in <a href=\"http://www.teos.fi/fi/kirjat/index.php?referrer=Baker&sub=2&id=367\">, and I just fixed it in the latest commit (22010765aa87aff7ab6f44dca63387d479fb56bc).\n. Awesome @bahmet. Huge thanks for having reported back how to fix it and having closed the bug as well. That's an impressive community mindset. Kudos. :)\n. Hi @sophiegc did you solve that issue? \n. @bahmet Could you please answer the questions I asked on your issue thread? ;)\n. I'll keep this open for a few more days in case someone has an answer. \nI'd suggest also that asking on StackOverflow can be a good idea. :)\n. It's related to the zoomable property of the book, false by default. Since it's false, and you open a page inside the book itself, what happens is that the page itself will not be zoomable, and set at its default baseline size.\nWhat are you trying to achieve exactly? Because:\n1. If it's a page that is designed to be opened inside the book, then it's better to design it properly at native resolution.\n2. If it's an external page, it's probably better if you use referrer=Baker to open it in Safari\n3. In any case, you might want to have a look at the meta viewport property that you can include in the HTML page.\nI hope this helps. :)\n. You're welcome. :)\nYes, that limitation by Apple is indeed a problem. We usually suggest to add simple animations or effects, it's usually enough. :)\n. Hi @yumyo is there any development about this issue?\n. Could you check if it's something about the screenshots by turning on three-cards instead?\nIf it's about screenshots, then it's probably the same as Issue #258. :)\n. Screenshots are small as files, compressed. In memory they expand to be as big as they need to be, about 19Mb each.\nSo, now you have 2 choices:\n1. You use screenshots and wait until Issue #258 is fixed.\n2. You use three-cards and change the animations from onload to window.addEventListener(\"focus\", function() { ... }, true);, as per Feature #225. :)\n. Yes, it's planned for 3.2, @Xmas is working on it right now. It's quite the last thing standing before 3.2 release. :)\nI don't think that the current codebase will help with the problem. It's mostly a memory issue there.\n. Thanks. :)\nWe'll test it out asap. :)\n. No worries! :)\nThanks for that. :)\n. Hi @steiny2k! :)\nI tested it right now and it works great!\nHowever we can't sign this feature as complete unless we add a couple more features, that are a must for an add-on browser like this:\n1. The back/forward navigation: I saw the xib and it should be as simple as adding a couple of buttons and associating the two UIWebView actions.\n2. A button to Open in Safari, because with this we are basically blocking that, and we still need to give that possibility to our users.\nDo you think you could add these yourself? :)\n. AWESOME. :)\nThanks. :)\n. That was quick! We'll test. :)\n. What do you mean? This isn't included yet. :)\n. @bahmet Please, as I said before this thread doesn't refer to your problem. This discussion isn't included yet so you can't have used it at all. \nPlease read this: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Managing-links-and-urls and if you still have problems please open a new issue.\n@steiny2k That's an issue with the main branch, we need to discuss this separately, adding features isn't always the right answer. ;)\nThere's no need to add additional flags on the dev side, it's solved with a link in the UI as I said above: \"2. A button to Open in Safari\". If that's implemented, we don't need any additional flag code-side. We need to discuss this.\nHis problem is different and doesn't refer to this issue. :)\n. We need to review that. I'm not entirely sure, as it will create inconsistencies in the user interaction with the platform. It's important to allow the user to go to Safari - that's why we have the button - but creating two paths might create more disorientation and is definitely one more complex piece for the developers to manage.\nBasically every app out there handles this thing in one and only one way, that's not by chance. ;)\n. @bahmet Please, open a separate issue. Please. Really. Please. :(\n. Ok, we merged the request, including the last change.\nWe are going to apply a couple of modifications:\n1. The two strings are going to be referrer=Baker and referrer=Safari to open modally and in Safari respectively.\n2. We are going to do a little rework on the buttons (text, position, look) to see what fits better.\nHuge thanks. :)\n. Ok, we switched that to a more standard black, already pushed to MASTER. \nThere are three things:\n1. BUG: Unfortunately, we found a bug: when you are in modal view, and rotate the iPad, and then close the modal, then the navigation is broken until you rotate the iPad again. It's probably because the modal view doesn't call our rotate function.\n2. BUG: The status bar behaves weirdly (double tap after the modal WebView is open).\n3. FEATURE: It's probably better if we can switch from XIB to direct code. We found a nice project here: https://github.com/akosma/nib2objc that has ready a downloadable GUI to ease the transition.\nWe're looking into these now. :)\n. Ok, I opened the separate issues to track them. :)\n. I don't get exactly what are you trying to do. Let me see:\n1. You open a site within Baker itself (no referrer)\n2. You have a form there\n3. The form... does what exactly? What should it do and what happens instead? What are you using to trigger it?\n. Ok, let's see, another couple of questions:\n1. What's the url in the POST=\"\" attribute?\n2. What's the url where are you landing instead?\nJust to be completely clear: it doesn't open the slider with the new Baker internal browser, correct?\n. The \"slider\" is the panel that now opens when you have a link with \"referrer=Baker\" :)\nLike when you touch the logo on the first page of the example book. :)\n. That feature is still absent, I added this issue as a feature request.\n. I close this issue since it seems that a solution is on its way. Please re-open it if you want to continue the discussion, if you want to provide a solution yourself or ask anything else related to this. :)\n. I'm afraid there's no way right now to do that.\nThe only idea I have in mind is that you might build a JavaScript that pings a server and uses data on the server to send the email.\n. Hello. :)\n1. Baker books are completely packaged and standalone, but you can make them interact with the web by using iframes and javascript.\n2. You can absolutely do that (actually I saw something in our showcase that does that). You just have to create a javascript library that handles it all and you're done. :)\n3. For Android, one contributor built Friar framework, here: http://www.friarframework.com/\n. Doing that is quite simple actually: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9473582/ios-javascript-bridge/9473941#9473941 :)\nHowever it's usually more complex than doing the same in HTML, if you don't want high speed and fancy effects. :)\nDoes this reply to you @chuckbrandt? :)\n. I know it might sound rough, and maybe it doesn't work, but it might be possible to just add the Google Analytics code in every page of the book... And maybe trigger a custom javascript event to track the single page. \nDid anyone test it yet? :D\nIt might be an awesome think if it works... :)\n. \"The challenge with OpenSource growth is in its developers inability to document their own code.\"\nAs you might guess, I disagree, but you say it better later:\n\"Whether they do the latter is driven by their ability to devote and willingness to invest the time.\"\nIt's not willingness, otherwise this project wouldn't be here at all. It's a matter of time. Our time is limited, as it is with any opensource project, where \"time\" is the primary and absolute constraint. So, it's very often a choice between writing code (and fixing, adding features or improving) and documentation, community, pr and so on.\nI personally think that we did a quite amazing work in Baker, given the time we had.\nWe can improve? Of course. But since our donations flow doesn't allow us to dedicate more time, the only extra time here could come from the community.\nThis means... that's up to you.\nIf you want, you can easily create a page on the wiki above with all the details you think are necessary, polish and expand it. Opensource isn't just about \"the developers\", but it's about the community. If the community isn't willing to support the whole project - and that doesn't mean just money - with documentation, contributions, feedback, and so on, the developers are in a really tight spot and they have to make difficult choices and compromises.\nSo, to rephrase myself:\nI personally think that we did a quite amazing work in Baker, given the time we had and that's at least 50% thanks to the community here. :)\n. Thanks. :)\n. Check issue #59 and #12 (guess also how old they are from their number) and imagine the decision we took instead of doing these two things. ;)\nHowever, I already started commenting the code every time I touch some function. It just... takes time. :)\n. @tstegart One suggestion that I might give you: if while doing this you are able to make it modular, then we have one more chance to incorporate it in our codebase. :)\nBtw, thanks to your work I changed this issue from \"Support\" to \"Feature\", since what you are doing seems plausible and even if we end up not supporting a specific analytics tool, we might provide callbacks - or building a delegate. ;)\n. @tstegart  By Modular I mean:\n1. Make a function that calls the analytics library\n2. From all around the code, call only that function, never add blobs of code around. Just the function.\nIn this way, you will have a clean separation: the analytics code inside a function, and a single line in all the callback points. It will also allow us to see where you need callbacks and who knows, we might find out some time to package up a delegate. ;)\n. What do you mean exactly? You mean in the modal window inside Baker?\n. Sure: add whatever parameter you want to the URL. :)\nI asked because the \"referrer\" technically is a parameter included in the HTTP header. We called the query parameter \"referrer\" in Baker because it has the same objective. However our parameter isn't technically \"the\" referrer, but a parameter called \"referrer\". I should probably add this to the wiki. :D\n. Thanks for the feedback. When that gets implemented we have to consider that. :)\n. WOW! Thanks for the link :)\nDo you have a twitter handle? I'd love to credit you in our tweet about it. :)\n. Done!\nThanks again :)\nhttps://twitter.com/bakerframework/status/175552084907802624\n. Could you post an code example of what you are writing to see first the starting point? :)\n. If it doesn't work on Safari, it won't work ever in Baker, I'm sorry.\nThe link however looks fine, as long as you have a page called \"boyama2.html\" in the same folder and in book.json it should work fine.\n. Is there maybe some javascript on the other page that might impact it?\n. @bahmet did you check the question above?\nAlso: could you send us the file, so we can check it?\n. Yeah, the javascript might impact the ability to open pages.\nThe book folder if it's possible, just the index.html otherwise. :)\n. Ok, received. We'll check. :)\n. Please, open a new issue, since it's a different problem. ;)\n. Thanks for the feedback, we'll look into it. :)\n. I guess you are using the app in Screenshot mode. :)\nTry doing a Proper cleanup: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Proper-cleanup\nAnd try again. ;)\n. Well the page shouldn't change once it's done, right? :)\nSo the customer will have the final version, and that will be the right one. :)\nIf you have dynamic pages instead, and you don't want the user to get the default view first, then you should switch to -baker-rendering: three-cards view: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters :)\n. Yup, let's use this thread to sync. :)\n. Ok, I converted everything in my codebase, but I still have some sizing issues that strangely were handled automatically by the XIB but through code not anymore.\n. No, we'd love to use XIBs, but unfortunately once you need to do thing even slightly more than what's possible in InterfaceBuilder everything gets very very complicated unless it's pure code. :(\ni.e. how do you fully customize the toolbar with a specific texture? how do you customize the button with a author-provided texture/image?\n. Conversion done in Commit ad710a7bae8aeb218979b0f4413faf73ca40c3d5.\nSome interesting things:\n1. nib2objc didn't work much, I had to do everything by hand\n2. I initialized the UIView to the Controller itself, and - more importantly - set its size and sizeToFit, in order to allow all the object inside it to work properly with sizeToFit and autoresizingMask.\nTesting a bit more before declaring this closed.\n. What do you mean by \"like the case of Forgotten Colours\"? What behaviour are you referring to? :)\nTo remove it from Newsstand just have a read on the wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-support \n. Yes, what about it? What do you want to replicate? :)\nAs far as I know, they did a custom development in house based on Baker. So, if you can't point out anything specific, it's better if you contact them directly and ask them if their App codebase is for sale. The link is on the same page you linked, they are Play Creatividad. :)\n. I think it needs to be all custom development unfortunately.\n. Sure you can. :)\nAlmost everything that's doable in a website, can be done in Baker... since it's HTML. :)\n. I think they will be very well received. As of today, the only official one with a good tutorial is Laker and it's the only choice to start with. We are receiving lots of private contacts of people asking for more resources, but as you can imagine there isn't much time for us to do that. :)\n. Is there any update on this idea? Any progress?\n. Could you give us more feedback? We need at least the Debug Log from Xcode, and maybe the file itself.\nIn general lines, Baker supports Unicode, so Chinese will work correctly. There's probably some encoding problem in the file itself.\n. Ok, we'll check with Issues #338 and #337, thanks! :)\n. Nope, sorry.\nHowever you can animate the page in JavaScript once the user swiped to it by using the Window events focus and blur as indicated on the wiki page: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Use-baker-javascript-events\n. Have a read on our wiki above: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-support :)\n. To start, try explaining what you were doing and how you got that error ;)\n. Then you should refer to Apple documentation and forums, we can't help unfortunately on submission issues that are on the Apple side: https://developer.apple.com/devforums/\nFrom the message above it seems that you aren't using the correct publishing certificates.\n. I'm afraid you'll have to ask either TestFlight support or Apple Developer support. We can't give support on Apple related issues here. :/\n. Have a try here:\n- https://developer.apple.com/devforums/\n- http://support.testflightapp.com/login?to=%2F\n. You could use JavaScript and localStorage to achieve that, but I'm not sure it could work and it's still quite a hack. But this is a good feature request, I marked it as \"Feature\". \nThanks. :)\n. 1. Centering on the page is something we are not going to do, but you can create a transparent page with centered elements in it. :)\n2. Yes, you're correct. This issue now is tracking the development of that feature. :)\n. I'm sorry, I misunderstood \"as well as center the index.html to the current page\", I thought you were talking about \"centering visually the content of the index\" instead of having as you have now a bar that covers the whole width of the page.\nNothing to add then. :)\n. Given the request from Issue #502, the features this bridge should implement are:\n1. Giving to the JavaScript in index the informations about which page is currently loaded.\n2. Give the ability to programmatically open/close the index.\n3. Give a communication channel of some kind between the two (i.e. to start/stop a music).\n. Duplicate of Issue 352. Closing. :)\n. Yes. It's a current behaviour of the system. We'll look into it.\n. Congratulations. :)\nAnd thanks to you. :)\n. We should be able to test on Retina soon, so the next version will be 5.1 compliant. \nIn theory, there should be no problem: Baker doesn't have any custom UI component right now and as such will not require any additional work (maybe in the upcoming 3.1 with the navigator, but that's all). Everything is UIWebView, and as such you will use the same techniques you can use to support Retina on the web.\nThere are various techniques, the most basic one is using media queries like you'd do to switch from iPhone to iPad. The media query parameter is min-device-pixel-ratio:\n-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2\nCheck for example this tutorial: http://flowz.com/2010/07/css-image-replacement-for-iphone-4-high-dpi-retina-display/\n. In theory, yes. I never tried it out extensively however to confirm it 100%. On the positive side, since Baker doesn't have a bandwidth limit once the book is downloaded, it's better to include only the high-res image. :)\n. No. Apple's solutions is very clever, because you don't have to change anything. It will just work. Images as well: they will just work. You need to update images only if you want to use retina double resolution, but if you are fine by having the same definition as the old iPad, then you don't have to change a thing.\nNobody had to rebuild whole websites when the iPhone 4 came out, right? ;)\nThis solution is very clever, unfortunately it creates just one side effect: \"1px\" in the CSS doesn't anymore mean a real pixel, because on Retina display it will be effectively rendered as 2 pixels. However, once you understand this, everything goes smoothly. :)\n. Baker current master is now Retina compatible, iOS 5.1 and iPad 3 tested. :)\n. Yes, you should delete them, since Xcode can't check which files are in use and which aren't. :)\n. What do you mean by \"all those fonts\"? Font-face loads only the fonts you tell it to load, and there should be one. Are you generating the code with some tool?\nIn general, Baker is Safari Mobile: you need to load only the typeface that works with Safari Mobile. :)\n. The TTF should be enough, but check it. :)\n. 1. Icons added in commit 073a57426f4e42effc514b8d925e0085c5bcac8f\n2. Arrows added in commit 7594930e2760a81396add9aea9e7a4a15f9cdaae\nDone. :)\nBaker is very light in assets. ;)\n. What version of Baker are you using? I'm asking because we released yesterday version 3.2 that had a fix for that problem. :)\n. I think you should have a look at Issue #332 regarding Analytics. :)\nIt's not there yet. :)\n. Aww! Thanks for the report, we'll check!\n. It's not a feature available out of the box, but I can point out that the code generating it is within the function - (void)initPageDetails and as such you might perform some editing there and achieve your need. :)\nAnother way would be to pre-generate the screenshots and use these. :)\n. Yes, the way to do that right now is by using the alpha setting. :)\nYou can play with the code in that same function if you want to do extra things. :)\n. Not out of the box, you need to do some work in the function I told you about above :)\n. Yes. We are completely dependant on Apple, since it's the same browser engine. :)\n. Yes, from what I've seen that should work. If you can, also PNG have an higher limit. :)\n. Yes, from what I've seen that should work. If you can, also PNG have an higher limit. :)\n. It seems there's already a workaround: http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2012/03/photography_on_retina :)\nAfter reverse engineering the limits and then later being pointed to the documentation about the limits, a birdie dropped a hint into my inbox telling me to try using a progressive JPEG file. Within just a few minutes, several people also chimed in noticing that the large iPad hero image is a progressive JPEG. I\u2019ve not used progressive JPEGs in years, but following the lead of the birdie and the crowd, I gave it a shot. Lo and behold, it\u2019s indeed the ticket to large JPEG joy on the iPad Retina display.\n. You should be able to find an answer in the wiki from the menu on top. :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Adding-an-Index-Bar-to-your-publication\n. Great ;)\n. Yes.\nActually we were discussing exactly this point this evening, and it's our tracking Issue #59. :)\nOur objective is to make Baker more modular, by moving it from being a RootViewController in an appropriate Class that could be easily included anywhere. :)\nThat's issue #59 ...would you like to help us by taking care of that - with our support, of course? :)\n. Did you just download, copied the folder and run? Nothing else?\nCould you please describe us what's in the log?\n. Here's how to do it, briefly:\n1. In the menu: View -> Debug area -> Activate console\n2. Run Baker\n3. Copy everything in the black console box from the bottom right corner in a new message here. :)\n. Excellent. :)\n. @mbayona you are right, you should be able to do that just by using CSS and media queries. This is one of the best sources and more advanced ones that you could find: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\n@manyakabi unfortunately that's not possible with Baker. A page in Baker is a page, exactly like on a book or on the web.\n. Hi :)\nThat feature is tracked by Issue #61, so please follow that one to be updated. :)\n@Bobramyl that's great, we'll wait for your pull request ;)\n. @Versioncrowd  Yes, I can confirm that Baker did quite big progress from one version to another, and not every publication worked on that - well, not even our own, I have to admit. :)\nWe should probably start tagging the page with the specific Baker version, we'll look into that. :)\nHuge compliments again to @Oliveirakun :)\n. We (finally) had time to update the show case, and you've been added. :)\nhttp://bakerframework.com/books\n:)\n. Yes, correct. That's the issue we are using to track this feature. Follow that one please ;)\n. Did you find a solution for this? Should we add this as a feature request? :)\n. Could you try to describe a little better what are you trying to do? :)\n. That's exactly what Baker does if you build a book with it. :)\nCheck the showcase: http://bakerframework.com/books :)\n. If you need to just read HTML files, you should read the UIWebView documentation from the iOS SDK. official Documentation.\nIf instead you need to incorporate the full Baker functionalities in your app that's going to be harder, but we can't help with that unfortunately, that's out of scope for us right now. In the future might be easier, that will be when the Issue #59 is going to be closed.\nAlternative ways could be:\n1. use PhoneGap\n2. build everything as a single book inside Baker and fake the structure you need using JavaScript.\n. LocalStorage should be usable: see Issue #198 for a user using it to perform another task (plus the usual Mozilla documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage)\nAs far as I got too, the session should disappear when the page changes, but for some reason (maybe I'm missing something) that's not the case for Baker books. But it might work only between page and index and not between one page and another. But I'd give it a try. ;)\n. If you need something local, you can just open a div over the current page with an iframe in it. Looks simpler to me, and without the overhead of an additional WebView. :)\nBut if you really think it's better, the best place to start looking is probably within - (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType. :)\n. An alternative way is to use the Application Loader that you can download from iTunesConnect :)\nWe'll keep this thread open for a while, hopefully Apple will fix that soon. ;)\n. No worries! :)\nThanks :D\n. You should use the standard HTML techniques, as any other website. :)\nIf you search around the web, you'll find lots of valuable details, like this one:\nhttp://flowz.com/2010/07/css-image-replacement-for-iphone-4-high-dpi-retina-display/\nConsider that depending on what you have to do, you can use a double-sized image visualized scaled down to 50% or use media-queries in the CSS. :)\n. It's very strange, but we can do some testing, sure. \nJust to be sure: are you doing the proper replacement, starting with the default image and using the new one only on the iPad 3?\nCould you include here the code you used?\n. Uhm I don't get it: designing in HTML5 is still smaller in size than Adobe's solutions, and if you start working at Retina resolution is as simple as a couple of clicks in Photoshop to do the exports, while most of the page should be HTML/CSS, so it doesn't need any change.\nCould you clarify what's the problem?\n. Ok, I got the download issue, that's kinda easily solvable however by doing the same yourself: a simple page that downloads the issue the first time the user runs it. It's not a shelf, of course, but it will allow that kind of granularity,\nFor the other issue... you say you don't use HTML5... but then, what are you using? How are you building the pages?\n. Thanks for the feedback! That's awesome. :)\n. Thanks @davidrsim!\nUnfortunately we weren't able to follow up on this, so thanks for the additional detail! :)\n. @tstegart When something gets solved or added, the topic is closed, so no we weren't able to add this yet. We were working on refactoring of the code as you can see from the other issue.\n. @FranG did you try using explicit <a name=\"keyword\">? Does it work reliably with that? :)\n. @FranG the problem is that it's not Baker at all. Baker handles just the page switch - if you link one file from another - but everything else is builtin WebKit. We can't do much on that. We'll try to have a look, but for now it seems a bug in UIWebView... :/\n. @jmkevan That looks impressive, thanks in advance for the contribution. Can't wait to read it. :)\n. @jmkevan Do you have any news? I'm very interested in the integration you were talking about. :D\n. What Baker version are you using, and what rendering mode? :)\n. Hi Miguel, I'm sorry that you didn't receive any feedback on this, probably nobody used that yet.\nHowever, checking their documentation they say: \"Support for swipe touch events for iPhone / iPad / Android\" and as such, it should work without problems in Baker. :)\nLet us know if you did any test. :)\n. @kilop: My advice would be to try building an index by yourself. It's really easy the way we implemented it now, no additional code is required: just make sure that it is a long strip (and add the fixed sizing as above only if it doesn't work). :)\nAs for the example, there's the Baker default book with a working index. ;)\n. It's possible in the game/app you have already on the iPad implements an external protocol: you wrap the screenshot inside an <a> tag and you point the href to the external protocol of the other app.\nFor reference see:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/419119/launch-an-app-from-within-another-iphone\nPlus, the google query you can use is: https://www.google.com/search?q=ios%20call%20another%20app\n. Did you check the links above? :)\nI don't know what I could add more... :)\n. Ok, now I understand your doubt. :)\nAs I said above, it's as simple as wrapping the image in a <a> tag and using the protocol in its href. So for example:\n<a href=\"biology102454://some/path\"><img src=\"pageview-1.jpg\" /></a>\n. You're welcome. :)\n. I probably answered too quickly they other time. We need to dig into this. :)\nI reopened the issue.\nDid you try to make it without the JavaScript - direct href call?\n. It depends on the application: most of them use that part to send data, because the objective isn't usually just to open the application, but to open at a specific point, so most apps have a \"path\" to be specified. \n. Yes, so if your app doesn't require any path, you don't have to put any path. As simple as that. \nWe'll check. :)\n. I'm sorry, but we didn't have time yet to check it. Unfortunately it's an opensource project and we don't have any dedicated developer, people support this in their spare time. \n. I'm sorry, but we didn't have time yet to check it. Unfortunately it's an opensource project and we don't have any dedicated developer, people support this in their spare time. \n. From what I understand you are trying to build a Shelf, please check Issue #20: it's in our plan, but it's not there yet. :)\nIf you want to, you might try to ask directly the author of Universo Relogio, that did an independent development, here: #374.\nOn the other side, to download directly a book from another book just use the book:// protocol, on our Wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book-protocol\n. You should create a different layout and serve it with a different media query when you are on an iPhone screen. That's the best way to do it. :)\n. What do you mean by that? That has a screen size, so you just tailor the page for that. No? :)\n. That's awesome! :)\nThanks for asking the use of the logo. You can use the badge image included in the sample book if it fits your needs, or the logo you find on the homepage to promote the framework you used in the book. :)\nWe should write some guidelines, you're right. :)\n. Awesome! \nThanks. :)\n. Check the bottom of the Showcase page for the link to submit it. ;)\nhttp://bakerframework.com/books\n. It's quite impossible to help you without any other information unfortunately.\nDoes it give any error?\nWhat does it happen exactly?\n. Uhm there isn't much more detail than what's there in the tutorial: \n1. take a Hpub prepared folder (with all the files and the book.json file)\n2. select all the files in your book director\n3. right click and compress them\nWithout more information we can't help much. What does it happen when you click on the book:// link? What message does it give you? What does the Debug Console say? Could you copy and paste here the Console output?\nAny detail is helpful.\n. You're welcome. :)\n. It's a feature of Baker framework: it remembers the last point you were reading. :)\nWhy do you want to workaround that? :)\n. It's possible, but you have to do it by hand.\n1. Find the function - (void)initBook:(NSString *)path\n2. Inside there, around line 496, find the line like NSString *currPageToLoad = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@\"lastPageViewed\"];\n3. Change it to: NSString *currPageToLoad = nil;\nIt should avoid the initialization of the stored variable on the first run. I didn't check it on running code, it might be slightly different, but it should be around there. :)\nLet me know if this works for you. :)\n. Excellent! :D\n. Thanks for the report, we'll check. :)\n. Hi, we are closing the refactoring of part of the code first, then we'll be back to this issue to fix it. I'm sorry for the delay but we really have to close that first refactoring first (you can see the releated issue and branch on github) so we have a better grounding to move forward. :)\n. It seems working now on MASTER, please test so we can close this issue. :)\n. Thanks! :D\n. You have to follow the standard Apple practices and either:\n1. Develop In-App purchase\n2. Create two applications, a Standard (pay) and a Lite (free) one.\nHowever mind that Apple doesn't allow \"demo\" applications, the Lite version or the basic with In-App purchase must still be a satisfactory, complete experience, albeit shorter/smaller. :)\n. 1. Nope, as I said you have to develop In-App purchase if you want to. :)\n2. I think that Apple will accept it as long as the Lite application gives a complete experience (as in, the first book of a series, for example). But it's really hard to tell. :)\n. The project above has been successfully funded 4 days ago. So, let's wait for it to be developed so we can have a great tool to add to Baker's production chain. :)\n. These are a lot of questions! :)\nI would advise you to start from the template you can download from the website and work start experimenting from there. You'll see how the json file works (no you don't need a specific editor), how to package it and how the pages are built. :)\n. Do you mean an invisible padding that's visible only when you're scrolling from one page to the other?\n. Unfortunately no, it's not possible. I'm sorry.\n. That would be great. If you are able to make it work, we will gladly accept a Pull Request. :)\n. Well, it's HTML, so everything you can do on HTML page is possible in Baker too. :)\nAs for the smoothness, try using the screenshot mode in Baker, it should be smoother. Unfortunately iBooks has an \"easy\" life since it's mostly just text, while doing the same in HTML is incredibly heavier - and as such, less smooth. :)\n. Well... \nFor the scrolling, just to give you and example, the App Store on the iPad is HTML, not native. Most of the people wouldn't be able to tell the difference in scrolling. :)\nIt's all a matter of effort. :)\nAbout iBook... Books made with iBook Author are enhanced HTML, from a certain perspective it's like a narrowed down version of Baker with some extra hooks. I don't know if the pinch is made in HTML or Obj-C however.\n. That was our first plan very early on, but we had to scrap it since it's incredibly heavy. Adobe gets around it since well... they basically use screenshots already.\nWe still haven't dismissed the ability to do it, it's just very challenging.\n. The PugPig source helps but up to a certain point, because they have a very different codebase and structures. They use the screenshot they do to accelerate page rendering to build the index itself. We use the screenshots as well in screenshot mode, so on that side we are already covered.\nThe big difference is that PugPig then does that by using native controls, while our philosophy is about giving full control and let everything be in HTML5, so our code will have to generate HTML. :) \n. Hi! Let's see a couple of points that might help you:\n1. Does it work on Mobile Safari?\n2. Did you check the CSS used in the page (maybe adding overflow: hidden)?\n3. Did you set a specific viewport meta size?\n. Please have a read of this page on our wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Managing-links-and-urls ;)\n. You're welcome, and let us know how it goes. :)\n. It's not possible yet, check issue #350. :)\n. So, you mean that you are following the wiki page tutorial (https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Take-pages-screenshots-for-a-Baker-book) and you aren't able to go ahead more than step 3?\nA few things then:\n1. Which Baker version are you using?\n2. Are you sure the book has be -baker-rendering flag set to screenshots?\n3. While running the app, are actually the screenshots appearing in the app?\n4. Could you describe step-by-step what are you doing?\n. Nope, sorry :)\n. It should be that you're trying to compile the Test Suite instead of the Application. Check the dropdown in the top-left corner of the Xcode window and make sure you're building the Baker App :)\n. Were you able to solve this? :)\n. That's a little too brief for us to understand. :)\nCould you please describe step by step what you were doing, what did you change, where it breaks and the full debug log?\nAlso, please write also the version of Baker that you're using. ;)\n. Great then! :)\nThese are the best problems: the ones that have an easy solution. :D\nKeep us updated on your progress. :)\n. I think you could just include the \"preview\" as your default book, and then use the book:// protocol (see the wiki above) from the last page to download the full version. :)\nHowever... the problem is going to be the payment, since you'll have to implement yourself the payment system. Otherwise, like many do, just add instead of a book:// link a link to the full version of the book (paid) on the App Store. :)\n. Sure, but then that will require first Issue #20 that will be delivered in version 4, and on top of that the in-app purchase.\nSo the answer to \"if\" it's yes, it's Issue #20, about the \"when\" I can't give you a timeframe, since our resources are limited and right now we are focused on Issue #59.\n. Did you try to open the same page in Mobile Safari?\n. Then I'm afraid but there isn't much we can do. \nYou should file a bug with Apple. :)\nhttp://bugreport.apple.com/\nYou can maybe try to see if there's any JavaScript that could support a custom interface.\n. Yes, it should. :)\nHowever the bug comes from an Apple library (probably the QuickTime component loaded in UIWebView) and it's deeply buried inside their software stack. I'd love to help and solve this issue but unfortunately we have no control at all over it.\nThe only chance you have is to open a bug at Apple and hope it gets solved in iOS 6: http://bugreport.apple.com/\nI'm sorry.\n. It depends a lot on the magazine itself. Some of them just download the book afterward using the book:// protocol and others move around the book just to avoid well.. what you just did, for piracy reasons. :)\nAs for learning, I'd suggest you to contact a few people that produced these magazines and books, even just to ask if you can do what you described, if not asking for better insights. :)\n. You can't.\nIf it executes, it can be done, and that's true for anything digital (with different amounts of effort).\nYou can open basically every single app on the store and see how they work, disassemble them and have a look at how they do things. Mostly like it makes no sense in \"obfuscating\" a website, there's no need in my opinion to obfuscate a book inside a package from an encrypted store that has your name in it.\nBut of course, some people disagree with me, and as such, you can either make the book downloadable - so, there's no IPA to open and you take care of the protection yourself on the server - or obfuscate the code, even if I believe it's more effort than benefit.\nBut remember: music majors failed big time in trying to enforce that, and in the end they discovered it was better to spend money on pricing and value instead of protection. And cinema majors are in the same league right now.\n. There's already the discussion #391 on this, please update that one. :)\n. It's a code signing issue, you should probably check your certificates/provisioning profile.\nWe can't help unfortunately on that side, I can advise you to ask on StackOverflow or on the official Apple Developer forums.\n. I didn't test this, but:\n1. You should probably have a look at the init function in RootViewController where the Index is initialized. You might try to set the initial frame there.\n2. The code you pasted looks coming from a previous version of Baker. Did you upgrade?\n. As you said, you can do Ad-Hoc provisioning. The easy way to do it is to use TestFlight, that will ease the whole id management issue:\nhttps://testflightapp.com/\n. TestFlight is primarly for testing. When you said a 7 day seminar I thought it was for their consumption during the seminar itself.\nI think you need to dig into Apple's documentation to see the various kinds of offering. If you want the apps to be installed and stay you should probably use an Enterprise account. However, the best source of information here is either Apple, their developer forums or Stackexchange, we can't help much on these topics.\nOtherwise, just make a public, free app that will allow then access to the seminar books behind a lock system you manage. It's probably the most flexible option if I understood what are you trying to achieve. :)\n. We should dig into this a little more deeper but at this point:\n1. The rendering should work correctly without any setup on iPhone and iPad\n2. The PRE-rendering isn't there yet, we didn't have any request on that feature and was behind schedule.\nSo, I think you are referring to the pre-rendering, right? :)\n. I think so, but could you put here the book.json example so I can have a look? :)\n. I don't think it's possible right now, you should probably code that yourself. You should probably by using the book:// protocol, and use it from one issue to link the other and load it locally. :)\n. The shelf should already provide that feature, and it's the next feature in line after the code refactoring. :)\nI can't estimate much the work, it depends exactly on what you want. It should be in the order of days tho.\n. Well... that's what you have to discovery I think. :P\n. Nope. But I'd advise to open a new issue here, so we keep track of the suggestion and we might implement it in the future. :)\n. I can suggest first to see this to see if it's a problem of something that's not \"clean\":\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue\nThen... it looks like an orientation problem. Are you able to color the background of the HTML in a full color (so we can see the edges) and send us the screenshots, if not a slimmed down version of the page that triggers the problem?\n. To info AT bakerframework DOT com :)\n. Unfortunately that's a known bug, and it's inside the UIWebView... so, it's an Apple's bug. You can try ti open a but in their bugreport system: http://bugreport.apple.com/ and hope that they will fix it.\n. Their bug report system is quite standard and tells you in a few lines what's a good format for it. Just open a new issue, specify the OS and version and describe what should happen, what happens and how to reproduce it. The more details you can give it's always the better - like you did here above. :)\n. The screenshot should be irrelevant: being there or not, that \"flash\" of color will happen. The best idea would be for you to expresse the solution in \"abstract\" terms, only talking about UIWebView and then citing that you found the problem by working in a specific way with Baker. :)\n. It's... way complicated if that's the same bug that we are tying to work around since version 1 - which, I'm not sure of course, but the behaviour is exactly the same. You can see another bug report here: #164.\nThe reason you see that in screenshot mode and not in other modes it's because the \"fade\" effect is applied there, while it shows itself in a different way in three-cards mode.\nThat said, go ahead: if Apple has already the bug report in the list, your report will count as one more vote to solve it. If it doesn't, then they will ask more details. And if you explain it - abstract or not - with a reference to Baker or even a link to this very issue, they can track it down. :)\n. Did you do any change?\nDid you try following this https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue ? :)\n. Hello, were you able to solve the problem?\n. The problem is:\nVersion: 3.2.1 (1613)\nYou need the latest Xcode version. :)\n. Great! :)\n. Wouldn't that require however the full download of the book?\n. Yes, but it's a bit outside of the scope of Baker intended as a \"iOS framework\":\n1. Make a server that handles book:// (or http://) requests, sees the \"hpub\" file as zip, unzips/reads it on the server and provides the file.\n2. Have the book \"open\" on the server (without .hpub extension) and just access the file through http://.\nThe first one requires a special script on the server (it could be as simple as a PHP script, but I would advise to build some kind of caching to avoid the constant zip opening/reading) while the second it's already doable but requires the book to be both as hpub and as unzipped version on the server. :)\n. Are you talking about the index to be swiped (i.e. the overlay), or the pages (i.e. the book itself)?\n. Ok, so:\n1. For the index. you should write a javascript yourself that moves the page to the very end the first time it loads.\n2. For the pages, you should enable the \"manga mode\", see the wiki on the flag -baker-start-at-page here: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters\nThis should do the trick. :)\n. I think you have to code it yourself unfortunately, it's not available in Baker, I'm sorry.\n. Unfortunately we don't deal with that: it's the default behaviour of the UIScrollView component that we are leveraging. You will have to rewrite it all, or subclass it in some way.\nBy the way, from an interaction perspective I won't advise to keep the movement and reverse the animation, it will be perceived as weird to the final user. ;)\n. That's what I told you: it's done by the native Cocoa component UIScrollView. It does everything related to the swipe: swipe, animation, all.\n. It's native, it's not in the project. It's from Apple iOS. We just use it.\nHere you can find it's documentation:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UIScrollView_Class/Reference/UIScrollView.html\n. No worries. :)\n. Hello! :)\nWe discussed this at lengths, and the conclusion is that we don't think we are going to develop this feature. I'm sorry if this disappoints you.\nThere are multiple reasons for this:\n1. Users expect to have pages containing the same amount of content for consistency. If you start shuffling these around they will get disoriented, since it's an unexpected result.\n2. Switching to horizontal doesn't create a page big enough to fit two pages \u2014 2p x 768px = 1536px vs 1024px \u2014 missing more than 30% of the required space, so re-formatting will still be necessary and a single page will have to fit in 384px, an incredibly narrow column.\n3. Practically no publication system supports content switching. On Adobe Digital Publishing (InDesign) you can create different content on different orientations, but it's not by design.\n4. Even Kindle/iBooks when switched just re-format the same page in two columns, however being a reflowing media it's not exactly 1:1, and as such epub is pretty famous to have problems in identifying specific pages in the publication.\nAlso, the book you link above is simply a PDF reader that adds padding when the two pages are side by side, reducing the size of the page by more than 30% (as above) and making them incredibly troublesome for the final user.\nI'm sorry.\nHowever, I have also to highlight the fact that this approach is beneficial to the reader: creating the content to be a match 1:1 portrait:landscape is a better experience, and you can reformat the content to enhance readability and visual effectiveness.\n. Could you add more details please? It's impossible for us to help without further details.\nSo, first of all: did you try this one?\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue\n. Does that mean that it never worked?\nCould you copy here the result of the debug log from Xcode?\nThe default book should work... however, in the JSON above you are missing a comma at the end of the line of page 6. Always check it with a JSON validator like http://jsonlint.com/\n. Well... we accept donations, yes, it helps us keep working on it. :)\nIt's on our website: http://bakerframework.com/donate :)\nThanks. :)\n. Uhm I don't understand, what do you mean? :)\n. A magazine is just an app, with special features. I'm not able to point you to any specific resources unfortunately. You might want to try however to start with the usual Stackoverflow and Apple tutorials. :)\nBaker will get the shelf (to allow multi-issue magazines) in version 4.0, but I don't have a release date for that yet. :)\n. About 50% of our overall time is spent on performance, so... we have already done all that was possible.\nThere are a few things you can do, change rendering mode to find the best one for you, pre-render the pages (https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters) to have them ready from the start and things like that.\nUnfortunately most of the issues are from the UIWebView and so most of our performance work comes from finding workarounds to that... :/\n. Yeah :/\nThe only thing we can do is open issues on the bug report...\nIt's also funny to see the same \"behaviours\" on Chrome for iOS: flash of white and such. :D\n. Hi and thanks for the support! :)\nTo answer your question, the vertical scrolling is determined by the height of the page itself, so... I guess there might be some margin or something in the page that makes it \"higher\". I don't know how Tumult Hype structures it, but you might try to put the animation inside a frame with a fixed height and overflow: hidden.\nThere are also a couple of flags you can specify, but while they might help, they aren't the direct solution to that problem:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters\n. Hi. :)\nBaker, and Hpub, are HTML5. As such, you can use any HTML/Javascript solution out there and make your quiz. It's something that should be defined at content level, Baker is just the container, like your web browser. :)\n. That line is necessary to make the whole thing work. :)\nIn the code, that's associated with the following comment:\n// This delay is required in order to avoid stuttering when the animation runs.\n// The animation lasts 0.5 seconds: so we start loading after that.\nThat's why we \"delay\" loading: otherwise the animation and the loading will interfere with each other.\nThe delay you are experiencing unfortunately it's entirely dependent from the UIWebView implementation speed, and we can't do much about it.\n. I think that you should start the code rewriting by checking the function setTappableAreaSize. :)\n. It's in RootViewController.m right now.\n\u2014\nIf you are just starting, notice that you can perform a project-wide search and look for it. :)\nSome details here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8016276/how-to-search-xcode4-2-project\n. You're welcome. :)\n. We kept the corners \"empty\" to allow them to be used for other things in the future, namely, the top-right one for \"Bookmark\". :)\n. I think I need a clarification: did you test the Baker project itself, or were you testing the quick tutorial to use baker in other applications?\nIf it's the latter, you should probably test first if the book works in Baker itself, as before. :)\n. Ok. That's fine. The tutorial is meant for people that want to include Baker in an existing project, so it's a more advanced usage. :)\nHowever we'd like to look into it still, so if you can zip it all and forward the new project you built to us that would be great.\n. @johnnyjiang Opening a topic and closing it for future reference when your problem is solved is simply amazing. Thanks for the contribution, you're awesome!  :)\n. The quick answer is: check the function downloadBook where the feedbackAlert is created. There's a parameter called message where the URL is appended to the message.\nThe long answer, that might help you in the future is: when you found the text message, you cal see that it's assigned to a constant called OPEN_BOOK_MESSAGE. To go back where it's used, just perform a search in the whole file for \"OPEN_BOOK_MESSAGE\" and you are going to find where it's used... that is, where I pointed you above. :)\n\u2014\nOn the other side, I think we can make that part simpler, so I keep this issue open as a reminder to fix that.\nThe idea is to change the message composition from a string append with stringByAppendingFormat to a proper string composition using %@. We'll check. :)\n. We checked a bit if it's possible and how it could be done.\nNow, in theory it's possible, but it's also quite deep in the code and so it might turn out quite hard to be done.\nHowever, as a pointer...\nBaker works basically by a combination of a UIScrollView and UIWebView. The UIScrollView is created within initWithBookPath and set as wide as the number of pages multiplied by the width of the iPad and as high as the screen height. In this way, the scroll view handles the horizontal scrolling automatically while the web view handles the vertical scrolling.\nTo revert this, you should change this whole logic and create HTML pages that scroll horizontally. I have no idea however how deep you need then to re-code Baker to make it work properly, consider that there are things like the rotation and the touch on the sides that needs to be taken care of as well and probably other things.\nI hope this helps. :)\n. Awesome work, we'll check it out. :)\n. Well, first of all I think a clarification is due: Newsstand apps are exactly like other apps. So:\n1. Being \"free\" is an option for both a standalone app and a Newsstand app.\n2. Both are subject to validation\n3. Newsstand apps have additional requirements: they need to support multiple issues and background downloading.\nThis also means that anything that \"could be a book\" will be rejected, regardless of being an app or a Newsstand app.\nHowever, Baker right now (version 3.x) doesn't support multiple issues and as such you can't use it in Newsstand (nor update it daily, since every updated needs to be validated by Apple). The upcoming version 4 will be instead able to support multiple issues.\nI hope this clarifies things up. :)\n. Downloading functionality is already there: it just replaces the book tho, and it's not currently compatible with Newsstand. But you can start from looking at that code, the hooks are there. :)\n~\nValidating: I was referring to the fact that today people that want to release new issue just submit an app update, and as such it requires to be validated. You're right: if you build the update in the app (using JavaScript) then you don't need to re-submit it. :)\n~\nWe appreciate contributions a lot, they are much needed. If you want to help, just pick up a task and coordinate with us. Just avoid to do too much work at once and it should be fine (it's hard and time consuming to review loads of changes, while smaller ones are easily pulled in). :)\n. It's not possible, we are sorry. However, we take this in as a feature request: we need to check, but it should be possible to be implemented in the future in JavaScript.\n. Thanks!\nThat's great news. :)\nAnd feel free to share your findings with the community. :)\n. As a reference, I think it's this app you were talking about:\nhttp://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/\nI close this issue, since the original problem seems solved and we have a similar request in Issue #466 that will address this as well if needed. :)\n. I don't think we can help much, since I don't know how they implemented the shelf. You should probably ask @nin9creative if he can point out what are the differences that might trigger the different behaviour. :)\nMy guess is that they removed the interceptor window, but I don't know how they compensated the lack of it. :)\n. But does your current gesture recognition work? The last time I had an update for you you were still trying to sort that out. Is there something still missing?\n. We'll check that, thanks. :)\nUnfortunately the changes are too big for us to check it all properly and move everything. On this specific fix we might have to ask some questions for that if you're available, or... if you could port back the new way you developer on the current master it would be awesome. ;)\n. Hi @trashoid did you try the last Baker 3.2.2 version? Does it work? :)\n. That Issue refers to a really older version of Baker, lots of things changed since that, so I guess no answer there can help you. :)\nYou probably found a bug in the latest version, we need to check. Thanks for the report. :)\n. Maybe, if you can: test referrer=Safari as referenced on the wiki: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Managing-links-and-urls and let us know what happens. :)\n. Interesting. Thanks for the feedback! I think we'll be able to check this next monday and see if there's a simple solution. :)\n. I think the reason is simple: itms is handled by the Store app, and there's no Store app on the simulator, that's why it can't work. :)\nSo, may I mark this issue as solved? :)\n. What do you mean by \"the bank\"?\nCould you please tell us what your app does, what you changed, what version of Baker are you using? It's quite impossible to help you without informations, please give us more details so we can try to see if there's a solution. :)\nThanks!\n. I'm afraid then we can't help much, you should ask them since it's a fork of Baker.\nWe'll still check and see if that issue is present on our side as well, but unfortunately the two projects are separate right now.\n. We have fixed it on our branch with this commit: ca5ec939d1cec47f4edbe3ff15a9d1a0347a3744\nYou could probably refer this to them so they can fix it too. :)\n. These are part of some libraries we are using. We can check if there are updates like the one you pointed out in the main branch, it might solve the issue. However as far as I know it shouldn't block from compiling, is that correct?\n. Did you try to suggest the change to the authors of unzip.c, so we can update and use the official release instead of patching it ourselves? :)\n. That's awesome, thanks for the update! :)\nWe are in the middle of some big changes, so we won't be able to quickly add this, but it's right up in the priorities. :)\n. Yes, they don't cause an issue, but thanks for pointing out. We have to check all these libraries for updates.\n. We weren't aware of it, we'll check. Thanks. :)\n. Do you have any update @ahmetomer? Otherwise we'll close this issue...\n. Did you try simply linking the page you want to jump to?\nSo if from page 8.html you want to jump to to 7.html just put a link <a href=\"7.html\"> and it should work.\n. I think there's no way to achieve that. I note this as a feature request. :)\nThinking again, you might be able to do it using JavaScript and some form of local storage, to store the page where you were and recall it from a function. It might work.\n. Well, that's probably still a good start ;)\n. I'm closing this issue since it's more than 6 months old. :)\n.

I can't promise 100% it will work, but you can quickly test yourself by creating a dummy animation with some complex thing and see if it opens and work correctly in Baker.\nIt should, because Baker is just the Mobile Safari engine (UIWebView) wrapped to provide a book/magazine interaction. :)\n.

Uhm basically if you can send us a small book made of just one page with fake content and css that you verified it can trigger the problem.

It's ok. Thanks! :)\n. It's ok. Thanks! :)\n. I think you hit yet another issue of UIWebView: it has aggressive caching.\nSee this issue:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3549508/prevent-caching-of-css-files-in-uiwebview-loaded-from-disk\nWe are not 100% sure, but if that's the case, the workaround to the problem is to add \"something different\" at the end of the css file you are loading between the two books, so you can have the same filename but to UIWebView it will look a different file. For example: src=\"style.css?book=1\" and src=\"style.css?book=2\".\n. Btw, the problem should disappear when we'll deliver the shelf branch, but we can't give you an ETA on that.\n. That's a shame. As said, it should be solved with the version we are working on, but for now I can just say that I'm sorry a different fix wasn't available. :/\n. @simondelacourt not likely. I already answered on your issue, check that. ;)\n. I'm closing this issue because the branch shelf will automatically solve it once become the master branch and gets released. This means that once Baker 4.0 is released, it will work without problems. \nTrack the development of Baker 4.0 by using the Milestones feature on GitHub here: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues?milestone=8&state=open\nThanks! :)\n. Ignore them. These should be just warnings and should compile fine. :)\n. Hello! Did it work? :)\n. Excellent! :D\n. Baker supports everything supported by Safari Mobile: canvas included. :)\n. That's not a Baker specific question: an animation in Baker is an animation in HTML. Just choose the way you prefer to do it. ;)\n. Xcode needs apps like Baker (or PhoneGap) to use HTML5. Baker loads HTML5 and the engine is WebKit, the same version you have in Mobile Safari.\nSo yes, anything that works in HTML5 on Mobile Safari will work.\n. That looks cool! :)\nWhat do you plan to do with it? Are you going to release it or make a paid service to package books? :)\n. Sounds cool. :)\n. Oh, so you didn't get the approval for sharing? That's unfortunate. :/\n. Unfortunately if the code can't be opensourced there's no reason to keep this topic open. Let's hope for someone with full opensource support. :)\n. I don't know in detail, but I guess no since the mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) and the touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel) are different.\nSee here:\nhttp://ross.posterous.com/2008/08/19/iphone-touch-events-in-javascript/\n. I can't make any other guess given the information I have. If it works on desktop but not on mobile that's the first thing you should check. What did you do exactly? Hammer.js seems an enabler, not a plugin, so you have to rewrite everything you did with Hammer.js to check if it works.\n. Ok, Hammer.js received the touches. Now you have to forward the touches to the same points where your app is now receiving the clicks. ;)\nThat said it's strange, because the app you have there shouldn't require management of touch notifications. Weird.\n. A-ha! When you'll fix it, could you come back and detail the issue and how to solve it? It could be very useful to others too. :)\nThanks! :)\n. That's great. :)\nGood job. :)\n. Yes. Unfortunately Apple can be very picky, and moody, about this. Sometimes just re-submitting makes it through.\nLet's see if there's something we can say: \n1. Why wouldn't it make sense as an ebook? (this just to see what could be done, I'm not questioning it).\n2. Is that an exact quote of the email you received? Isn't there anything else? Usually they refer to specific parts of the agreement that you didn't follow, is there any?\n. Uhm that review is quite decisive, and it's not really about the fact it's a magazine, because we saw other rejections for that reason and their feedback was \"Publish it in the Book store\", here they aren't saying it.\nGiven: \"the user interface of your app is not of sufficient quality to be appropriate\" it seems more about the app overall quality, not the fact it's a magazine.\nWithout having seen it however it's hard to tell with more precision, but this would be the clue I get from them.\n. Yes I know it's a quote, I was just saying that the problem highlighted isn't that it's a magazine. If you search around, you see it's different from other cases of rejection, where the text was: \"Apps that are simply a book should be submitted to the iBookstore\" (App Store Review Guidelines 2.21).\nI'm really just guessing, they might well have changed the policy internally. I have no idea. \n. Hi @marwol  did you solve this issue in the end?\n. There might be some issue with iOS 6, but we still have to look into that. They did change the code to manage rotation, so that might be the issue.\n. Thanks for checking. It's definitely an issue of iOS6 then. :/\n. We'll track the orientation problem in Issue #493, so we can keep the rejection and the fix isolated. :)\n. I think this should be a book-related function, defined by the book or magazine author and tailored to the specific needs of the publication. I think it could be a simple JavaScript and HTML solution: the JS loaded in each page, parsing the content and highlighting with CSS the terms it find adding a link to the specific glossary HTML in the book.\nFor example you could implement it with something like this JS: http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html\nWe'll be glad to add this as an extension for the books, but it's not going to be part of the Baker framework, since it's pure HTML/CSS. :)\n. I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve. I can guess that \"horizontal anchor\" is a normal link to another page since that was the reference of the point (1) in the Issue #64.\nCould you:\n1. Tell us what Baker version are you using.\n2. Test if it works in the latest 3.2 from the website, the current MASTER from here and, just in case, version 3.0?\n3. Paste here the link you are using, and maybe a step-by-step description of what happens and what should happen instead.\nThanks. :)\n. Ok, I checked it. We have a quite complex code inside Baker to manage urls, so it's going to be complicated to find a solution there.\nThe best workaround I can suggest you is to use localStorage, in this way:\nin destinationAnchor.html:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction jumpScroll()\n{\n    if (window.localStorage.side == 'right') {\n        window.scroll(770,0); // horizontal and vertical scroll targets\n        window.localStorage.side = '';\n    }\n}\n</script>\nin origin.html:\n```\n\n    function jumpToPage(url, side) {\n        window.localStorage.side = side;\n        window.location = url;\n    }\n\nLINK C: Click here to try to make destination page anchor right \n```\nIt's not as clean as it should be, but should work. Let me know. :)\n. Hi @CatherineEng did it work?\n. It's quite a standard feature, and there's no official way to disable that since it's a very important feature for the final user.\nHowever, if you really want you should probably look where the UIWebView is created and change it following the informations you can find on the web:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/849225/iphone-is-it-possible-to-hide-native-scrollbar-in-uiwebview\nMind however that's not a public API, and as such can easily break when upgrades come by.\n. Yes. :)\n. It's a UIWebView (documentation) so yes, to execute JavaScript from Objective-C that's the correct function. :)\n. The first thing I'd fix is the last comma:\n\"cover_back_variant.html\",\nand see what happens with that, because in the log you can see it says that there are \"zero pages in the book\":\n2012-09-17 12:21:39.318 Baker[27257:c07] Pages in this book: 0\n;)\n. Hello @sevirinov  :)\nTo answer your questions:\n1. To sell your app you should have the Apple Developer account. You set that up on the iTunesConnect website. For in-app you need custom code that you have to add yourself to Baker.\n2. Baker restores the publication at the latest reading point.\n3. Baker doesn't support NewsStand yet, however that part is managed by NewsStand (will be). :)\n. You can do that using one of the standard HTML techniques around, for example:\n- http://www.studiopress.com/design/css-background-size-graphics.htm\n- http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/blog/retina-image-replacement-for-new-ipad/\n. I don't think approaching the problem with a meta viewport helps, and even so, the width you specified is huge. Why did you put 1536px?\nJust try removing it and working on the CSS / media-query parts, and just after that try with something like:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=768; initial-scale=1.0;\"/>\n. Hello! Did you solve it? :)\n. Yes, unfortunately it's a known bug introduced with a low-level change in iOS6, we have to update that.\nSome reference links on the issue:\n- http://blog.hawkimedia.com/2012/08/ios6-ready/\n- https://gist.github.com/3725118 (potential fix)\n- http://dhilipsiva.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/ios-6-ui-interface-orientation.html\n- http://www.cocos2d-x.org/boards/6/topics/15447\n. Version 3.2 doesn't have it anymore. The current master version has been completely upgraded to be modular. :)\nWhat are you trying to do? What you're looking for might be in RootViewController. ;)\n. Why aren't you just using the version on Master?\n. No I mean using the Master version from GitHub, with already the fixes in. The one where you commented as well. ;)\nClick on Code at the top and then Zip. :)\n. It's good to know, great! :)\n. If it's a new problem, please open a new issue and please please please describe EXACTLY what happens, hopefully following these steps: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue\nThanks! :D\n. Please test as I linked you above and describe it clearly in a new issue, then we'll see if we need to see it. As I said I can't understand anything about the problem if you don't do these steps and describe it better. :)\n. Maybe you're referring to another meaning for \"page\" (for us it's a single HTML file). \nCould you explain better what you mean by \"doesn't snap to the current page which you are viewing\"?\n. Thanks, now it's clear. :)\nHowever, you are saying that it doesn't happen every time, but in some situations it behaves properly (first and last page). Did I get this correctly? And, is there any difference in these pages?\nAlso, following the tutorial here: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue\n1. What version of Baker are you using?\n2. Is there any difference in the Debug log between when it works and when it doesn't?\n3. How does Safari Mobile perform on the same pages?\n4. Did you try moving a page that works (the first I guess) to a different position in the book (using book.json) and see if it still works?\n. That's correct.\nIt's likely a combination of the CSS changes and the orientation and I think there isn't much you can do. To rule completely out or in the possibility of that, did you try to test the page in Mobile Safari and rotate?\nOtherwise yes, it's likely you'll have to use JavaScript.\n. Baker unfortunately doesn't support that yet, it's the same support missing #434 and we have it scheduled right now on the 4.1.\n. Given that's the second time in a couple of weeks (see Issue #479) I can just guess that Apple has changed or is changing its approval policies.\nIt seems that PhoneGap users have similar issues: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/phonegap/rejected/phonegap/2dPIMUmBbAk/XibomfhLSoQJ\nThis thread specifically contains also some suggestions on how to try solving it... I hope it might help.\n. We're open for contributions, as you can see we already have all these things lined up in this issue tracker but alone we can't do everything. So if you can develop any of these things, let's have a chat in the matching Issue here on GitHub and let's proceed. :)\n. Unfortunately as we discussed BakerShelf has broken compatibility about 1 year ago and so we aren't unable to support it or merge it. :/\n. Yup. You the code to check that specific bit is inside this function:\n- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType\n. As far as I know it's possible, but you have to implement it yourself since it's beyond the scope of Baker.\nThis is a good starting point: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5746289/determine-if-an-app-exists-and-launch-that-app-on-ios\n. It's as any other app: you have to do that by yourself. Just define your own protocol and implement it. :)\n. Added in commit feb166df88ff9a8e5b8dcfec06fb3049fdcf1acf\n. In general terms, the reason is simple: consistency. We don't want to introduce big alternative behaviours from the ones that are already common in other apps (where the index is either shown with one or two taps).\nThat said, we have Issue #350 planned to allow the third option you just quoted. ;)\n. Uh... Are you really sure the same problem doesn't appear in Mobile Safari? Because I tested this yesterday and it jumps in Mobile Safari as well, exactly the first time as you described...\n. Yes, it's exactly the same problem I tested in Mobile Safari hehe. It's a CSS issue, we can't do much.\n. WTF!\nImpressive debugging @danielszczygiel :o \n. If it's not possible in HTML5, it's not possible in Baker.\nAs for the HTML5 support: if it's there in Mobile Safari, it works in Baker. ;)\nFor 3D, given this review:\nhttp://caniuse.com/webgl\nWebGL is not yet supported. Sorry.\n. Try deleting the app from the simulator/device. It's likely the automatically-generated screenshot, that is generated only once and stored. Switch to three-cards mode in the book.json while you work. ;)\n. Hello, were you able to solve this? :)\n. It's not possible right now, but we'll add it as a feature request. :)\nThanks. :)\n. Did you already try this?\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue\n. You're welcome. :)\n. It's simple. :)\nJust update the PNG files inside the \"icon\" folder: :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/tree/master/icon\n. Hi! Did you manage to do this? ;)\n. Did you test it on Mobile Safari as well? Does it work there?\n. Given your feedback and the fact the problem doesn't appear consistently I think it's outside Baker's scope unfortunately, we don't have any code that deals with that, it's the UIWebView... but...\nHowever: did you actually compile older versions of Baker against iOS6 and it worked, did I get this correctly? If you did that, at which version did it stop working?\n. Sorry if I look pedantic but you are saying that Baker 3.2 compiled fresh on iOS6 still works, did I get that right? :)\n. Ok, thank you. We'll look into it. :)\n. Ok, thank you. We'll look into it. :)\n. Well the \"solution\" would be to use the iOS standard... so the standard video tag and simply embed the videos. But of course we'll have to look into this. Or if someone wants to look into this and provide a patch, of course. ;)\n. Lol yes, sorry github comment ate the tag :P \n. It's not built in Baker yet, so you have to add it in by yourself. The best course of action would be to find some tutorial online.\nOn our Push Notification feature request issue you might find some more information, here: #292.\n. Hi @Issean! \nThere's no builtin way to do that, you need to check the function - (void)userDidTap:(UITouch *)touch and remove the part you don't want to use. :)\n. You should open a different issue, yes. However in this case the answer is kinda quick and also... non Baker related: in both the cases the answer is: yes, as you would normally do with HTML5. So it's some custom coding you will have to do with JavaScript, we can't support much on that, but I'm sure you'll be able to find sources online. :)\nYou're welcome! :)\n. Did you follow all the steps here? \nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue\n. So... as that page says, could you transcribe here the debug log (point 4) and tell us in more details (point 2) what happens on Mobile Safari (point 5)? :)\n. Ok, but does it work in Mobile Safari? That's the very first thing to check, since it's HTML. :)\n. Ok, that's clear, thanks. We'll look into it. :)\n. Closed because it's a duplicate of #513. Please use that thread. ;)\n. It's not there yet, but it's part of the feature #350, where we will provide that kind of information in javascript so you can just read that information and update the index accordingly. :)\n. You're welcome! :)\n. You are referring to the github master, not shelf, right? \nDoes the official version 3.2.2 have the same problems?\nCould you please follow these instructions: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/It%27s-crashing%2C-exploding-or-any-other-issue and paste here the debug log of what happens when you try downloading?\n. OK then there's definitely something weird happening because... 3.2.2 is exactly the same thing as master... can you make any guess of what could explain it?\n. It's ok, it happens. :)\n. Can you provide a proof-of-concept that triggers the error so we can test it?\n. Nice, than you. We'll look into it. \n. I reopened this because we are using this as a tracking for the bug.\n. Thanks, that's a very valuable information! We'll review it. :)\nYou should be able to implement it yourself easily, check the file BakerAppDelegate.m and check the initialize function. :)\n. Thanks, that's a very valuable information! We'll review it. :)\nYou should be able to implement it yourself easily, check the file BakerAppDelegate.m and check the initialize function. :)\n. Ok, it's in Baker now! Hype should work out of the box now. :)\nThanks. :)\n. Yes: it just means that the HTML needs to properly set its width, something that the default book doesn't do because uses floats. Make sure that the objects inside the HTML (the window and body) have dimensions and they are correct.\nHowever, please create a separate issue if you need support that isn't related to this one. ;)\n. Thanks for the feedback. We'll use this to keep track on the iPhone development side of issue #20. Right now we weren't working on that since we are still working on basic features.\nWe had to ditch nibs because they made things more complicated when developing more than one year ago, but everything else is correct. We will switch the hardcoded values with evaluated sizes. If you want to prepare a fix and make a pull request that would be great. ;)\nUsing the name convention for the images is definitely something we will have to do, since it should be already supported by UIImage.\n. Great thanks! We should be able to check it tomorrow. :)\n. Right now, Baekr 3.2.2 doesn't have support for the shelf / multi-issue yet.\nBaker 4.0 will have, but it's still not complete. You can check the progress in the branch shelf and in the issue #100 (plus the Milestone 4.0 always here on GitHub). :)\n. Hi. :)\nThere's no XIB, everything is built in code because we needed more flexibility and control. That button is generated in ModalViewController.m in the loadView function. Check the *btnAction variable.\n\u2014\nIf it doesn't appear in landscape mode it's a bug. Thanks for the pointer. :)\n. Hi @CatherineEng, do you have any update? :)\n. Thanks :)\n. In fact, that would be a nice idea to start with, without the hellish complexity of a UIWebView. :)\nDo you think it is going to be complex to add such a button? :)\n. Personally, I would avoid implementing that: too minimal to be useful. :)\n. No I'm sorry, it's not what Baker is for... you should probably build yourself the javascript required to emulate that, or look for an existing pure JS library.\n. Baker is a Objective-C wrapper that allows you to use HTML/CSS to create a iOS App, while Laker is a magazine template carefully designed for Baker. \nHpub is a HTML/CSS package, but it's designed to run inside a wrapper and Baker is the default implementation. :)\n. It's not really something under our control, Apple might have changed something with the latest versions of Xcode, which version are you using so we can check it? :)\n. Yes, you can indeed create manually the screenshots... it's just a bit slower, but I guess that if you do them at once on the device and transfer them it's still quite quick. :)\n. How is the video embedded?\nYou might want to check Issue #510, seems the same issue. :)\n. That's a great work! Where are you implementing it right now? master or shelf? :)\nCould you also detail a little bit more the difference between \"Swipe\" and \"Page\"? I'm not entirely sure I got it. :)\nFor the rest, I think that the JSON label you choose is ok, I would probably give different names to the properties but I'll wait to understand better the difference between the two. :)\nGood job! :)\n. Right now Baker uses a UIScrollView, with pagination, and places the UIWebViews over it. Everything is then managed automatically from an interaction perspective, we \"just\" have to instantiate the UIWebView accordingly (using one of the two modes, screenshots or three-cards). A lot of the code there handles the smooth transition when the user swipes the scrollview.\nAbout the modes, if swipe is similar to the native functionality, what are the pros of using it instead of the native one? :)\n. Yes, seems correct to me. :)\n. Impressive work. :)\nMay I nudge you a bit to use GitHub to show the code to us (and the future Pull Request)? It's really little effort and simplify things a whole lot (and GitHub support is great if you need info). :)\n. Yes, a branch would be ideal (it will also help you to manage changes when you merge back into shelf or master) and then the pull request will help us a big deal. :)\nBut, no hurry. :)\n. It should be fine creating your branch and linking it here for now, because in that way we can see the progress and test it. Once ready you merge with master and so it will be a pull request to master with your branch merged into it. ;)\n. Yes, it doesn't match. Whops. :)\nThanks for the updates, you're making us following you very simpler in this way. ;)\n. Ok! :D\n. We are using branches labeled with features, Baker 4.0's main feature will be the shelf, so the branch you should look at is shelf. :)\n. Even if it doesn't seem like it, it's a huge rework from the current structure. We won't be able to do it in the next version, but we'll keep the suggestion open as a feature request. :)\n. Do you have also the Debug Log for it? :)\n. This is definitely more useful, but I was referring to the Xcode debug log... :P the one with the debug information Baker writes out about what it's doing. Are you able to replicate the bug inside Xcode? :)\n. ok! :)\nwe'll look into it with this data. ;)\n. We checked the logs but unfortunately we can't find the cause of the problem. Check if you can reproduce it... and we'll see. :)\n. So... did it happen again? :)\n. Which version of Baker are you using?\nThat said, check if a different HTML page (completely different) does that as well...\n. Nope. But we changed the code. You might try to go back to older Baker versions and see if it does that as well: I'm not sure if it's something we changed or something Apple changed...\n. JavaScript shouldn't be needed at all. However, this is still weird... are you able to upload a video on YouTube so we can see what's happening on your device? :)\n. Uhm... indeed, my first guess seeing that would be similar to yours: the CSS media-query kicks just after the rotation completes.\n. It would definitely be useful, I agree. :)\nMay I just ask a couple of clarifications?\n1. Scrolls: you mean vertical scroll? When should this event trigger exactly?\n2. Switch the page: isn't that the same of #225?\nThanks! :)\n. Hello @anjimi, we updated that page a bit and... yes, we are still working on the documentation. :)\nAlways work in progress, but there are other pages you might look:\n- https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Newsstand-vs-Bundled-publications-support-in-Baker-4.0\n- https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Subscription-pingback\nI'm also guessing that you tried the shelf branch instead of the master branch: master is now the only one, and shelf contains just an old version. I'm guessing this because in master there are already more information in the code. :)\nLet us know, it might be helpful to have a better idea on what to write and how to organize the documentation. :)\n. Yes, check the master, it should be clearer there. ;)\nThanks also for saying that the wiki is organized. I feel that \"organized\" is a bit of a big word, but I'll try to improve it soon. :D\n. Hi @bahmet excuse me but I'm not sure I understand you correctly: what do you need exactly? I'm not sure because from a published app you can't see much of the process, and on the other side we are looking for publishers: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Launch-test-for-Baker-4.0-(shelf)\n. I'd love to see that to. We are looking for publications as I said above hehe. :D\n. Either here (open a new issue for you if you want dedicated open support), or the project's contact email (info AT bakerframework DOT com) are fine. :)\nIdeally, by downloading master you should be ready to go. :)\n. Well, for us it's fine, it's Apple Review the culprit here. :D\nThe instructions are in the link above: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Launch-test-for-Baker-4.0-(shelf)\nCould you tell us what's not clear so we can add more details? :)\n. THANKS. :)\n. THANKS. :)\n. We worked a bit on the wiki and now there's a more extensive tutorial here:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/4.0-tutorial-for-Newsstand\n. That's great news! Thanks. :D\n. In other words: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11895035/do-newsstand-apps-require-push-notifications :)\n\u2014\nPlease @anjimi but don't use this issue for discussion, open a new one if you have any doubt around a specific topic, otherwise we can't track, help people and reply to messages properly anymore. :)\n. As reported here on Stackoverflow it seems that in the In-App Purchases Guidelines there's a paragraph saying:\n\nFor review purposes only. Your In App Purchase screenshot will not display on the App Store or on the iPhone device store. Once you have tested your In App Purchase and are ready to sign off, upload a screenshot of your In App Purchase in this section. The screenshot should be a clear picture of your In App Purchase in action and must be 320 x 480, 480 x 320, 320 x 460, or 480 x 300 pixels.\n\nSo... it seems pretty much open. :)\n. Thanks @nin9creative  :)\n. And that fixes everything with no drawback? That's awesome! Great job. :D\n. You got it correctly: optimization. \nWell... very good digging indeed, keeping shouldRasterize and fixing that with scale is even better. :)\n. I agree. \nI think that right now for simplicity reasons it's better the approach you suggested: one image, scaled. :)\nWe can think about the alternative in a future version, if it's required. MVP. ;)\nThe ideal resolution should be double the standard px size, 135x180px = 270x360px (retina). :)\n. Good point. I think it's relevant, and I agree with you. It should be in 4.0. :)\n. Wonderful. :)\n. It happened once on iPhone to us as well, but we weren't able to replicate it, and it didn't happen on iPad for us. From what we gathered:\n1. It seems to happen only when there are more elements than the ones fitting on screen.\n2. It happend without rotating it, but it might be helpful to nail it down.\nWe think it could be a de-allocation issue somewhere, but we have not clue for now, because as you've seen it's difficult to replicate and happened only once to us on a non-Xcode attached instance.\n. Thanks, we'll check, meanwhile:\nCan you access the JSON file from your browser?\n. It seems you are zipping the folder instead of the files within the folder. Try that :)\n. Thanks for the feedback! :)\nFirst, could you please open 1, 3 and the \"other quirk\" as separate issues? :)\nAbout 2, the name is taken from the book.json file from the title parameter. :)\n. We need this open until it's \"solved\" by either documenting it or finding a clearer solution. ;)\n. Thanks. ;)\nI think it's going to be more complex than that, because the shelf is independent from the book, but we can look into it. There might be already a solution, but I prefer to have a separate issue so we can address this properly. ;)\n. Did you maybe try to disable the other orientation in the app configuration? \n(See the first screenshot here)\n. I ask you to test the shelf then, it might be already fixed there. ;)\n. The \"Subscribe\" button should turn off. :)\n. That's correct.\nAnd nobody knows... actually, do you ever found a magazine that explains that? We would like to see it, but we still have yet to find one, so far it seems that nobody does it.\n. That's not correct: that's Push Notification, not Subscription. The subscription just allows you (the author) to get the data of the user subscribing. What you do with that is usually the Push Notification, but it's a separate piece of code. :)\n. Hehe yes guys, but you are missing a piece of the puzzle: Push notifications CAN trigger Background download, but they are NOT tied to it. :)\nBaker today implements background download without Push. Actually, that's one of the reasons why we are asking people to submit to the store: that's the only way we'll know for sure. ;)\nOn 29/nov/2012, at 19:06, Andrew notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nNewsstand Push Notifications\nTo receive Newsstand Push Notifications, your application \nmust register for them (which in turn prompts the user for permission). \nInclude this statement early in your application lifecycle:\n1 UIApplication.SharedApplication.RegisterForRemoteNotificationTypes (UIRemoteNotificationTypes.NewsstandContentAvailability); \nand add a new entry newsstand-content to the string array key UIBackgroundModes in your Info.plist\nOn your server, add this payload key to your APNS message \nto notify the Newsstand application that new content is available for \ndownload.\n1 {'aps':{'content-available':1}} \nHandling this type of notification would normally involve \nstarting a background download of the new content.

I thought @darren2c57's version was right. I thought push notifications was just the message you could send to users notifying them of a new issue (and having a little badge show up on the corner of your icon), but Newsstand actually did the downloading of the new issue in the background by itself without any push notification.

From the iPad browser there's an icon in the top right corner that opens Safari. It's default behaviour for iOS apps. :)\n. Ahhh ok, now it's clearer. :D\n\nCould you paste here the link you are using, so we can check it?\n. I'm closing this issue since the discussion didn't progress. Reopen if needed. :)\n. Thanks, we'll look into it. :)\n. Wow. :D \nIf you are able to fix it, proceed with a pull request so we can review the code and merge easily! :D\n. Is this related to #642?\n. Baker development has moved to a new address, check the issue tracker and give your feedback there! :)\nhttps://github.com/bakerframework/baker/issues/15\n. Hello there, this tracker isn't in use anymore, please refer to the new house for Baker development here:\nhttps://github.com/BakerFramework/baker/issues\nThanks! :D \n. Unfortunately that's custom development that was done on top of Baker, it is not a standard Baker. Sorry.\n. You can create a transparent index, full-height, and use just the top part and bottom part of it... maybe... :)\n. 1. Hpub \u2014 As @benoitchantre said: just select all the files inside the book folder, zip them and rename the file from \"zip\" to \"hpub\" (pay attention to truly rename it, Mac OSX sometimes just hides the extension).\n2. Upload \u2014 Then, you put the HPub files built in this way anywhere on your server, each publication as a separate file, correct. The shelf.json file you will build (and point to from Baker) will reference all these HPub files you uploaded.\n3. Test \u2014 @benoitchantre gave you an excellent suggestion to test the magazines before working in Newsstand. When you are ready with that, you should then follow the Newsstand tutorial, create the publication on iTunes Connect as said on the tutorial and assign the proper variables. All of this is explained in the Newsstand tutorial. With this, you will be able to test the Newsstand part. \n\u2014\nThanks for the feedback. I think the wiki still needs some more cleanum, and that's a good correction we need to make. The reason is that a book made for Baker 3.2 is exactly the same book you make for Baler 4.0. But it's not that clear I'm afraid. :)\nFor the tutorial... since we are a bit time constrained... well... I know it's difficult but... may you (or anyone really) want to write it? Your suggestion is again very very valid, it's just we are lacking time. :)\n. I'm closing this issue since the discussion seems ended. Reopen if needed. :)\n. I'm closing this issue since the discussion seems ended. Reopen if needed. :)\n. Just create a javascript that listen to window.focus and window.blur so you can trigger the video when it gets visible. :)\n. You're welcome. :)\n. It's not a \"fix\", it's the whole new code in single_purchase that does that. And unfortunately that code isn't ready yet, not even for testing (we merge in master when the code is ready).\nHaving the button not doing this isn't a blocker, you can submit as many others did already. :)\n. This issue board is closed since 2014. Please refer to the active Baker board here: https://github.com/bakerframework/baker/issues\n. My first guess... It looks a transparency rendering bug. How are you setting the white background of your HTML? A CSS body rule?\n. Yes, I'm aware. But unfortunately the UIWebView is and isn't Mobile Safari at the same time and we had to use some tricks (including making some components transparent) in order to try work around some bugs.\n. Actually, you should do the opposite: ADD body color. Because by default the page is transparent. ;)\nHowever, I really have no clue why that happens.\n. You're right, we should do something like that. :)\n. Thanks, that's a good starting point. :)\n. I'm not sure about this. Baker is about creating custom, beautiful HTML books. Doing this is... something else. Why don't you just convert the content in HTML? \nWe need to think about it, and wait for more people interested in this specific feature.\n. Well... think where that \"local document\" will be stored... ;)\n. That actually was possible, isn't it working anymore? If it's not working, then definitely open an issue. :)\n. Thanks @yujulio for pointing that out. The part that shouldn't work is the download part, but we didn't want to explicitly disable also the opening part, that's an unfortunate byproduct.\n. I'm closing this one since it fell down a bit. Maybe try asking on twitter and pointing out Baker's account so we can RT it and give it more visibility. :)\n. Might be a bug. We'll check. :)\n. Uhm. That makes me think: @sportyguy209 did you try putting just the anchor name in the a tag (\"#test\")?\n. I'm suggesting to see if \"#test\" instead of \"glossary.html#test\" works. :)\n. When we work on something, we update the corresponding issue to keep everyone updated. No updates means that we still didn't have time to work on it. Sorry.\n. Thanks, that's a valuable feedback. :)\nIt seems a UIWebView issue there... mumble. I wonder if it works in iOS7 then.\n. However, the flash is a result of the page itself, by design it's completely seamless. :)\n. Ok. The important thing in a general sense is that you work to decrease memory load, that seems likely the issue. The white flash is a WebKit bug so there's nothing we can do, only Apple can (and please, open an issue on Apple's Bug Tracker if you can). :D\n. Congratulations. :)\n. We checked it and we decided to add it to our showcase! :)\nhttp://bakerframework.com/books\nCongratulations. :)\n. Is everything ok then? May I close this issue? :)\n. Hello! Unfortunately I checked but the code seems incomplete. I contacted you in the email to update it and evaluate the inclusion in the showcase. :)\n. It's not possible right now. You can have just a single setting for the whole book (or page), but not switching between different book flags.\n. Well, book in theory shouldn't specify that... however... this is already a feature request for that. ;)\n. I think the answer is... you are going to edit a lot of files to do that. :)\nIf you want to start editing Baker in Objective-C it's better if you start looking at it and understanding how it works in the various files and then you could start working with it.\nAs a rough overview, consider that there are two main components, the Baker view (the actual player showing the HTML5 pafes) and the Baker Shelf (the one that shows the list of books). These two elements are separated, they communicate just through a small call and they are placed on the screen in a navigation structure.\n. It's a bit vague. We already have issues opened here that are tracking these issues. But it's about the feature request (i.e. search) and not about the solution (i.e. put an icon on the toolbar). Check the ones that are missing in your opinion and add them. :)\nI'm closing this issue then. :)\n. What do you mean by \"not working after first show\"?\nThat said, you can use the two events windows \"focus\" and \"blur\". :)\n. Ok, but that's exactly what \"screenshot\" mode does. That's why I don't understand. :)\nHowever as I said, use windows \"focus\" and \"blur\" events. :)\n. Ok, let's try again. :)\n1. As I said, use window \"blur\" and \"focus\" (works in both three-cards and screenshot mode). :)\n2. In screenshot mode, you can just provide your own screenshots. Provide empty (maybe even transparent) ones and you're done.\nThere should be no need to change Baker for that. :)\n. I don't understand what you're asking. :)\nRandomly:\n- Adobe has its own publishing solution, it's called DPS, DIgital Publishing Suite and costs on average 6.000$ per year to start with. They use screenshots, like Baker's screenshot mode and that's why you don't see loading most of the time.\n- Baker uses instead HTML5, giving unparalled flexibility and following an open standard. See the HPub standard in the wiki for that.\n- We introduced \"screenshot\" mode because \"three-cards\" was too heavy to run with rich publication. So I won't expect anytime soon a \"five-cards\" approach.\n. No. :) \nBut I'm curious, what would you expect to happen using the two at the same time?\n. Then it's screenshot mode. :)\n. Not exactly:\n- screenshot mode shows te loading just once\n- you can pre-load the screenshots so it won't do that even once\nCheck the wiki for the documentation ;)\n. I don't understand what you are asking. The screenshots are visualized while the page loads, so you don't see any loading after the first time -or- if you provide the screenshots yourself. That's what screenshots are about.\nIf you keep seeing a loading screen, then there's likely a problem somewhere else. Are you providing the screenshots? Are the screenshots being saved? Did you set the right pre-rendered screenshots variable?\nThat said, having 60 large images per page isn't probably a wise thing to do. Check maybe some delayed load javascript component.\nHowever, I'm closing this issue since we cleared that it's not a matter of implementing a new feature. :)\n. Hi @calaba,\nThanks for the feedback, you raise a lot of interesting points of discussion. :)\nFirst of all, we updated the wiki, so now it's accurate. As you noticed there was a typo and it was misleading. :)\nAs for the suggestion, unfortunately we can'd add a default behaviour for normal links, the reason is that pretty much any javascript out there rely on the fact to be able to use standard URLs in page. Many people use libraries like Google Maps and adding a default behaviour \"open in modal\" would make all these scripts to simply stop working.\nTo solve your problem at hand is actually quite simple: just write a regexp and append automatically the referrer parameter to all your links. It's a very quick operation with common editors that support regexp. :)\n. Well, you don't have to change the source, just add a script before you prepare the Hpub package and you're done (even simpler if you have a CMS that manages your Hpub export feature). :)\n. You probably have to write a plugin to automate the creation of the Hpub files and the shelf.json file from Wordpress. It's something that some private companies did, but so far there's nothing open source we can point you to. :)\nThe plugin should likely be able to select the posts you want to be part of the issue, export them as static HTML files and zip them up in HPub. At the same time it will update shelf.json with the new issue.\n. Hi :D\nThere's no special event, because you can do that with the standard set of HTML events (scroll) and variables (scrollY).\nYou can quite easily monitor that and with some math generate an event every page scroll (you could even probably build a library for others). :)\n. Thanks for the submit. I think you pointed out a quite important and delicate change. :)\nWe checked this request but we saw quite a few problems and apparently a mass find/replace of the keywords that doesn't help in making us comfortable of such a delicate change.\nThe fact that it isn't auto-mergeable doesn't help either.\nIt's surely a thing that's interesting and likely worth it, if you check we even tried in the past but we had to revert back due to some issue raising (it was likely too early). \nSo... if you can review this to make it more solid that would be great. Right now however I would advise to wait first the next release of Baker. :)\nThanks again. :)\n. Well... is your page vertical? :)\nThe scrolling behaviour depends on the size of your page. Make the page 300px wide and it will scroll vertically. In other words: open it in Safari: is it vertical? If not, fix the CSS to make it so. :)\n. You're welcome! :)\n. Well... Baker is HTML5. The only way I can think of in HTML5 to do that is to use an iframe that includes the other page. :)\n. You're welcome. :)\nIn a general sense, we tend to avoid as much as possible by \"adding\" features to the browser, to have books that are 100% compatible with the standard web. :)\n. First: thanks for having tried to solve the problem to such extent before posting. It's uncommon and you deserve credit for that. :)\nOne more think I might ask before trying to debug... could you post here the details we ask in the Problems and Debugging page (steps, log)?\nMy guess right now is that you followed the tutorial for version 3.2 instead of the one for version 4.0, here: \nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki\n. The old link was there, but it meant to refer just to the first part of the tutorial. After your message we took it out and separated properly. As many things here it's always a matter of having time to do things, so feedback is critical, thanks. :D\n. I think we have to make a step back. :)\nIf you are following the Newsstand tutorial (from the wiki page above) you don't have to put anything in the book folder: you are using Newsstand, so all the issues are remote on your server.\nPlease follow through the Newsstand tutorial from the very beginning, step by step. :)\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/4.0-tutorial-for-Newsstand\n.

    "svdgraaf": "oh, and if anyone else has any specific concerns or ideas to add, please let me know\n. pull request is available:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/pull/6\n. Sure, let me know if I need to change anything or anything is not clear.\n. sure, I'll take a look at it and fix those issues. The pagenumbers need quite a bit of refactoring I think, but I'll see what happens.\nI'll close this pull request for now\n. ah, great :)\n. Hmmm, too bad we removed the xib's from the project, I need to put in a lot of code just to get the orientation changes fixed, which we could get out of the box if we used the xib's :(\n. Ok, as as far as I understand right now, the problem is that because of the extension of the UIWindow, the new source window (in this case the InterceptorWindow), needs to handle the orientation changes of the device. I can (probably) add all the code in there, but it would take quite some time, whilst we would get it for free using the default UIWindow.\nBut perhaps I'm completely off, as I'm relatively new to obj-c. I'll put in some more time and see if I can get it working without (or get a solution with the xib's).\n. The extending stuff is what I figured too, that's what makes it so weird :)\nI just committed what should be working, but isn't, perhaps you can take a look at it? The didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation in RootViewController doesn't get called anymore, while the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation does get called in the RootViewController, which doesn't make sense to me.\nI tried adding a listener for orientation changes, which worked, but the full application doesn't get rotated, it just notices that the device is rotated :(\n. Ok, I think I got it, the initWithNibName method probably appends some logic for implementing the rotation of the views. I have a somewhat working version right now, but it does use the xib's, I'll clean it up and push it.\n. Ok, everything is in place now for it to work, except for the IntercepterWindow Tap functionality. I'll take another look at that tomorrow, but I'm not sure if I can figure that out.\nOther than that: rotating is awesome! :D\n. ok, everything should be in place now for a merge, can anyone check my version and let me know if anything needs work?\n. errr? I guess you are experiencing the same bug I was having ;) The problem is in the settigns which are saved from a previous session, in other words -> it wants to load a pagenumber of a previous build which you ran, but it can't find it.\nI'll solve the bug, it needs to be fixed anyway :)\n. Try again! :)\n. awesome! :D\n. The code is in, we only need to add a build for the iphone version, I haven't worked on that yet, this is just the rotation changes. Let's put that in a separate changeset as this one is getting pretty big already :)\n. cool! can you point me how to setup compiling so it will run on an iphone? I want to test it too :)\n. never mind, got it! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2413948/setting-xcodes-target-to-iphone-not-ipad\n. Yeah, changing the css width to auto fixes the build for the iphone, which is awesome, because it works even without testing it! :D\nIf we can pull this into the main branch, we could perhaps create a 1.1 release of it :)\n. Yep, that should do the trick :)\n. Awesome, I'll take a look at those points, if Folletto can find more, let me know :)\n. Ok, the taphandlers are fixed, and the xib's are removed.\nI'm not sure about the rotation check, I think that is one of the things that need to be added to the meta file. Currently, the uiWebView just renders the html again. If you design the css correctly, it will just center your html file for you, so the user is already in control. If we add the meta file, we can add that to the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method.\n. ok, since we lost quite a bit since the downtime. I think the status quo is that I need to test this on a real device to figure what is wrong with the sizing, and why it differs from the simulator :(\n. Great, I had a quick call with Apple today, I should be up and running with my dev account somewhere within the next 24 hours, woohoo!\n. great, my dev account is enabled, I can see the problem with the rotation now, it's really, really weird. Anyway, I think it's not that hard to fix, I'll get cracking!\n. Fixed! :D\nLet me know if any other issues arise, I would like to have this in asap, as I want to get working on the zip support :)\n. @ilovemac, what do you mean? The packaged default book works over here?\n. Awesome! Anyone else who can approve? :)\n. Can anyone check this pull request again? I would be nice to get it merged with Master :)\n. Thanks a bunch mates, keep up the progress and discussions :)\n. awesome, people are pretty excited over the possibilities over here :)\n. Yeah, I noticed that too, it gets worse if you build larger pages with more content. But that bug is also in the master branch, let's fix it there :)\n. Yeah, I'm not sure whether this is an issue or a feature :) \nuiwebview needs to do a proper reload to get the new size of the view. I don't know how to fix it at the moment, perhaps someone else can take a look at it? I don't have any time to check it out tomorrow, perhaps on friday. Then again, I think we can pull this into the master regardless of this \"issue\" ;)\n. Fix for the flashes is in, it will only flash once now, and only if the app was started in landscape mode, and you are rotating to portrait, after that, it will work without flashing. If the app was started in Portrait, it will not show any flash.\nAnd as a bonus: the rotating is a lot faster now too! :D\n. @segundoseis I tried to reproduce your bug with the fast rotating of the device, but I can't reproduce it (or I'm getting old, and can't rotate as fast as I should ;)), it could also be that it's fixed because of my last bugfix for the rotation.\nCould you check again? Thanks!\n. hi!\nYeah, it's almost finished, just haven't found any time to get the last change out. It should be a minor fix, so if anyone is willing to look into it: awesome, send me a pull request on my local branch :)\n. awesome! I haven't had any time to work on this whatsoever :(\n. I'm not sure whether alphabetic ordering is smart, also looking at what folletto notes above. I would love for the hpub standard to define how the files should be named, I personally liked the numbered pages a lot :)\n. Suggestion: default to numbered pages, or define a file order in the meta file?\n. I agree :)\n. done ;)\n. Another thing I thought of this afternoon (also in combination with the Footer bar/navigation), is thumbnails.\nI can imagine an author would want to set an image per chapter (page), and one for the overall book.\nWe could set the preview image for the overall book in the meta file (or perhaps define a thumbnail.png, and the images could be set in a meta header or something, or look for an image with the same filename, but with a .png extension.\nI would not define any image sizes, as the user can use the images in different ways.\n. I would like to generate thumbs from the html pages as well, but I don't think that that is a option for now. The PNG extension is the best option for now I guess :)\n. I just had an idea. We can save the meta file as json file. Why? Because it's easy to parse (there is a good library for it), xml is a lot of unnecessary overhead, and the enduser can use the json file in their javascript in their pages itself to do additional stuff.\nAnd above all of that, it's easy to read, write and understand, and it's easy to add additional custom fields.\n. I see one big issue, which is my main point to prefer split files over one big file. I'm looking for ways to easily distribute magazines across different tablets. Every page could potentially have a completeley different stylesheet and have a lot of dynamic content (slideshows, videos, etc) which is not going to go well with one big file. Our HTML files are actually going to be built by multiple persons.\nThat being sad, it would be silly to both work on somewhat the same standard, and I like the idea of not having to use a manifest file at all.\nBtw, the bigger players in the market (woodwind, adobe) do use multiple split files, with a manifest XML structure (last time I checked).\nOh, and hpub is actually a better name ;)\nMy 2 cents\n. One of my commits in the rotation pull request should enable this, now it's just a matter of creating another build, see here: https://github.com/svdgraaf/baker/commit/7752a48489cff0c6dd5cca5af60f86e4c1265b28\n. You should fork the baker project (there is button on the top), make the changes in the fork, and add a 'pull request' (also on top over here). I think that's the way to go, it was my first too :)\n. @ilovemac: I'm already building tests with some of our magazines which are reformatted for ipad usage, works very, very good :)\n. @ilovemac yep, that's a bug in the main branch as well. Just clean your ~Library/App support/iphone simulator//Applications/ directory, and you should be fine.\nBut perhaps there is a better way of cleaning up old leftover bits :)\n. awesome, I fixed the bug in my fork already (checks for valid number, otherwise default to page 1).\n. I created a quick branch for pointing to what I'm thinking of:\nhttps://github.com/svdgraaf/baker/tree/navigation\n(tap on the window to open up that navigation). The links don't work, and rotation is a bit weird, but it works somewhat ;)\nIt's extremely simple, and uses a separate navigation html file. The height and location could be set in the meta file, but I'm not so sure about that.\n. Nope, it's actually a separate layer in the app :)\n. Wait, I just got a brainwave ;)\nThe solution within the pages itself is better (with the javascript and all), what we could do, is send an event once the page get's tapped (or does the uiwebview already do that?), so that the html page can do stuff as showing a menubar etc.\n. I think so, not sure ;)\n. The background color issue is simple to fix I think. We can just add a simple 'background' color to the meta file, have it be a hex color, and we can then read it and use that color.\n. ",
    "Xm4s": "Duplicated issue, discussion continue on https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues#issue/6\n. Wow! You were really fast on this one :D\nThank you for your help, now give us some times to test and review your code, we'll give you a feedback as soon as possible.\n. Hi svdgraaf!\nI have reviewed your code and rotation works like a charm :D \nBut there are some things that needs to be fixed in order to merge your patch on our master branch.\nFirst of all the compiler returned me 3 warnings: while they are not critical at all, they have to be fixed for a clean release. I think you forgot to declare the function initTapHandlers in the RootViewController header file and that is causing the warnings, try have a look on that.\nSecond we have the page number: we can't remove them completely because they are a precious reference for the user, to show him where he is and of course where is he going (expecially now that multiple taps/swipes to jump around pages are available). I know that having to rewrite them on the UIScrollView in case of rotation may not be very fun, but it has to be done :)\nThen the page reloading on rotation: while is perfectly correct it's not very good as it is. Could you please try adding a fade out of the page before the reloading to make the transition more smooth? I think that should do the trick.\nAnd finally the forced portrait mode on application startup: we think that the application should check the available orientation of the book and the orientation of the device to present the views of the expected size. We were thinking about putting a flag with 3 possibile value (like for example \"portrait\", \"landscape\" and \"both\") to define which book templates are available and handle the three possible cases:\n- case 1, flag == \"portrait\": app forces protrait mode on startup and blocks rotation to landscape.\n- case 2, flag == \"landscape\": app forces landscape mode on startup and blocks rotation to portrait.\n- case 3, flag == \"both\": app checks the device orientation and presents the correct views, both on startup and on orientation change.\n  Of course this flag will have to be set manually in the code by the publishers, at least untill the definition and implementation of a proper HPub standard. I've seen your code, maybe you can start by making a new function out of the instructions you use to handle rotation and then call it where and when you need it.\nWell, that's it. I know it seems like a lot of work, but we think that all those points have to be clear in order to add a polish rotation support to the framework. We really appreciate your help on the matter so we would like to know if you're willing to take on these tasks and what you think about them because, as i said before, you already are on the right track and your help and opinion is really valuable to us.\nThank you for the hard work so far, we'll be waiting for your feedback :D\n. Hi svdgraff!\nI've quickly reviewed your code and it'works pretty well, just a few notes:\n- I can't seems to find the check on the available orientations of the book (the one we discussed before)\n- At every rotation you keep adding tapHandlers without removing the older ones. Maybe you should have some kind of reset function, which remove all the old spinners, page numbers and tapHandlers, called before the rotation is handled (inside the \"shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation\" may be a good point); also at the same time you can try add a fade out animation to the current page, to smooth the rotation and reload transition a bit.\n- I really don't think xib files are necessary (well, I try to remove them and everything worked just fine :P)\nWell that's all, as I stated before I just had a quick look at your code. These notes are both for you and for Folletto, who will provide a deeper and better review as soon as he can.\nIn the meantime let me once again thank you for your help on this task, you really are a hard worker and you deserve our praise for your support.\nSo let's keep up the good work together :D\n. Hi! \nWe'll test your code as soon as possible.\nFor now, as always, thank you for your support :)\n. I'll handle this\n. Handle custom file names and alphabetical order visualization. Tested on simulator and pushed on main branch, waiting for a test on physical device (just to be sure all is ok) before closing. \n. I've started working on handling url opening in the framework.\nThe first version of the handler will recognize url like book://example.com/bookname.hpub and download the relative .hpub file.\nAdd parameters handling after that shouldn't be a problem :)\n. I've commited the first step in url handling, the others will follow as soon as possible :)\n. Just committed support for addressing a specific page in the url, now:\n- book://example.org/path/newbook/chapter 10.html\nwill download http://example.org/path/newbook.hpub\nand open it at page \"chapter 10.html\" (if found, otherwise it starts from the first page)\nIt's the same for the url book://example.org/path/newbook.hpub/chapter 10.html\n. Ok, from commit 410da40c42c32a9caf8f2fc130f60dc8361281e0 it's possible to publish on iPhone devices :)\nTwo small notice on the matter:\n1. The default configuration in the Project Settings is iPad by default, one should change the setting as needed (for targeting only the iPhone or iPhone/iPad); see the README file for details.\n2. The iPhone Baker Icon (57x57) is still missing inside the project, we'll be adding it as soon as possible :P\n. Icons tested ;D\nAll works well, I'm closing this up.\n. Done in the commit https://github.com/Simbul/baker/commit/1b4e509c295a5e53747880c47fafd1a2b5f325d6\nA test with the actual device is welcome before closing this issue :)\n. Ok, I'm closing this up.\nThanks for the help Jeff :D\n. Hi creatov!\nThank you for your praising words! We are always happy to find someone who likes Baker. Also, thank you for opening this issue as well, we always need feedbacks on the framework to fix and improve it, so you are already helping us here :)\nNow lets see your points:\n1. If I've understand correctly you are referring at the white background with page numbers that could be seen while jumping from nonconsecutive pages. At this time that is the expect behaviour of the framework and it's a way to show the reader that he has moved backward/forward in the navigation of the book; However we are already discussing other solutions about the background in this issue https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues#issue/22, so if you have some ideas feel free to add them there, any help is appreciated :)\n2. I think I got this one: if you've named your files 1.html, 2.html, 3.html... 16.html, then the correct alphabetical order is 1.html, 10.html, 11.html... 16.html, 7.html, 8.html and so on till 9.html. Since the framework orders files alphabetically that should explain why you have page 7 after 16 (and also 10 after 1 maybe?). Try to rename your file 01.html, 02.html, 03.html, etc..., rebuild your app and see what happen, I expect your problem to be solved.\n3. I've been unable to reproduce the strange animation you mention while compiling and testing the framework untill I tried it on a device with the new iOS 4.2, then I saw what you are talking about. Thank you for point this to our attention, we'll be working for fixing that as soon as possible.\nThat's all, I hope this answer helps you as much as you have helped us.\n. Since points 2. and 3. seems to be resolved and 1. is already discussed in another issue I'm closing this up.\nThanks again for pointing out the scrolling down bug in iOS 4.2 so we could fix it up for its release.\n. I've looked into the problem, actually the \"jump\" animation it's the uiscrollview inside the uiwebview that's bouncing after scrolling too much over the end of the page.\nI'm already working on this, I'll have a fix ready as soon as possible.\n. I've just commited a fix for this problem (commit https://github.com/Simbul/baker/commit/c5e1400f86a68ec90af9bccf4e7fecb7d7790246)\nUnfortunately I can't try it on iOS 4.2 right now, so, before closing this up, I think a test is required :)\n. Thank you for point this out segundoseis, I really haven't though of that :)\nI guess that hard coding 1024 was a bit gross :P I'll have it fixed as soon as possible.\nAbout svdgraaf code, that's still being revised, so up to now I've worked on the main branch of the framework. As soon as its ready for a merge we'll add the rotation on the main branch too.\n. I've made a little improvement to the fix, now handling the scroll limit with different device orientations (when available) should be much easier :)\nSince the bug is fixed I'm closing this up, thanks for the help.\n. Hi,\nI've made a little experiment with @font-face and I was able to embed a truetype font in my .html page within Baker successfully.\nUnfortunately I couldn't made a test on an actual iPad device, however both iOS 4.2 simulator and my iPhone with iOS 4.2 showed no problem with embedded fonts.\nSo, maybe you should check out your @font-face element and/or your font files.\nAs a reference try this site: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator, I think it can provide all the help you need to embed your fonts :)\nI'm leaving this up till a test on an actual device is done, just to be 100% sure.\n. To address the problem of the smoother transition we have re-implemented the \"three-cards\" views approach.\nBasically now, a part from loading the current page, also the next and the previous page gets loaded outside the screen.\nWith this solution the transition between two subsequent page doesn't present any loading delay or flash of content. \nHowever, since loading and rendering a html page in a UIWebView is a slow operation (and also seems impossible to speed it up), sliding too quickly between pages will make the old page numbers and loading wheel reappearing.\nThe \"three-cards\" approach is released under the \"three-cards\" branch of the repository.\nWe would like to hear some feedback about it, so please try it out and let us know how you found it.\nThank you :)\n. Thank for the feedback guys :D\nI'm currently doing some experiment to improved Baker overall performance with the three-cards navigation.\nAs soon as I get some results I'll let you know, in the meantime keep up posting your feedback and ideas, you're doing a great work :)\n. Hi Mimetic!\nThe 0.5 sec delay before loading the page was introduced to avoid multiple loading requests on the uiwebview when a user quickly tap on the left or right side to turn multiple pages at once. Removing it could cause the page turning to slow down and stutter a bit (because every time a page is turned the uiwebview try to load a page), but it's worth looking into it.\nBy the way we merge the three-cards branch into master, we'll continue work on this issue there :)\n. As @therabidbanana suggested I've just adjusted three cards method to load first slot 0 (current page) then slot +1 (next page) and finally slot -1 (previous page). This should improve perfomances a bit as well as reduce the chance of memory problems.\nTests and feedbacks are welcome as usual, thank you :)\n. @mimetic\nI've downloaded your book example but I wasn't able to test the javascript swipe nor in Baker neither in Safari Mobile. Could you please explain how to make it work? Thank you :)\nAbout the \"bounce effect\", that's really weird: since the horizontal scrolling is paginated, there shouldn't be any bounce while swiping through the pages. Can you explain it better and add some instruction to reproduce the bug (or a sample to see), since so far I was unable to do it?\nBy the way loading and managing more than 3 UIWebView may be too much for the device to handle, it's already hard to handle 3 of them at the same time :)\n. Could you explain the steps to reproduce the bug ?\nI have just tried to download the latest master branch and compile it with no problem, so I'm a bit clueless :)\nOne thing you may try is to clean the project (in Xcode click on Product --> Clean) but I don't know if this could help (but still is so quick you might as well give it a try)\nAlso be sure to have the latest stable version of the iOS SDK (4.3)\n. UIWebView has an attributes \"mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction\" from iOS 4.0+, default YES\nReference: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html\n. Hi MacBoy,\nFor what I can see the problem lies in the \"._\" files: those files are resource forks that are probably created by Mac OS X during the .zip creation. Since their extension is .html the framework recognized them as valid pages and showed them in the correct order.\nI've released some fixes tonight, one of which is a new method for retrieving the html files from the book folder that ignore resource forks. With this the problem of the \"ghost files\" should be solved :)\nThank you for the help, I'll wait for your feedback on the fix before closing this up. \n. Oh, yes... neuro.local is the name of my local server, I've written out of habit while I was doing some tests :P Yes, 127.0.0.1 is much better.\nOk, bug fixed, i'm closing this up :)\n. Thanks for finding this bug :)\nFixed with the commit https://github.com/Simbul/baker/commit/b8a6d2e3a28d12e4842c214489400cfced893125\nI'll wait for a positive feedback on the fix before closing this up.\n. Thank you for discovering and pointing out the bug :D\n. Hi!\nThanks for pointing out this!\nI've looked into this bug and the problem is in your commit request.\nIf you reset currPageNumber to 1 only when the saved value of currPageToLoad is 0 (which in my calculation was impossible even before your contribution)... well, the chance you are resetting the variable to 1 are equal to 0 :P\nI'm fixing this with the bug pointed out in the issue #36.\n. Fixed with the commit https://github.com/Simbul/baker/commit/b8a6d2e3a28d12e4842c214489400cfced893125\nAs for issue #36 I'll wait for a positive feedback on the fix before closing this up.\n. I completely agree with you, even if it shouldn't be possible it's better to reduce any chance of the app crashing down, and in fact I didn't revert your change on lastPageView value check before saving it :)\nHowever, as you have said here, the check as it is need a quick fix, I'll apply that as soon as I finish writing this, thanks for pointing it out.\nBack to the topic of this issue, I try the step to reproduce the bug (link on page 5 a .hpub with only 3 pages) and it seems that everything works pretty well with the last commit. Could you please confirm that?\n. Thank you for your precious support on the project :D\nI'm closing this up.\n. Well, first I would probably try my book with the latest version of the framework and see how it works, then I would merge the changes I need in the new code one by one.\n. I think you should first try the book with the pristine 1.1 version of the framework, then you should implement your changes in the code with Xcode.\n. Very strange.\nHave you try deleting the app from the simulator and then installing it again? Sometimes the simulator fail to recognize correctly that some files have changed in the book directory, a fresh installation should do the trick.\nIf you continue to have problems post here the steps necessary to trigger the bug and we will look into it as soon as possible :)\n. Could you explain better that - Locate the folder book in two languages \"en\" and \"es\" -?\nIf you are saying that you have added two folder, \"en\" and \"es\", within the book directory, we have found the problem: Baker looks for HTML files only in the book directory and not in its subfolders, so maybe you see a white screen because the framework found no pages to show.\n. Maybe the problem is in the way we retrive the path to the bundle book directory.\nTry to change this line (132 in RootViewController.m):\n\"self.bundleBookPath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"book\"];\"\nwith this one:\n\"self.bundleBookPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"book\" ofType:nil];\"\nThose methods return the same path in general condition, but the latter should automatically recognize the localized bundle.\n. I'm glad I could help you, hope to see your book on the app store soon :)\nThank you for pointing out this inconvenient (and also test the possible solution), that in the end led to a improvement for the framework.\n. I've tried to block the webview from loading the content to check if the spinner for each page was there and... well, they are all there :)\nMaybe you don't see them because the webview load and show the pages content too quick for the spinners to fully appear (a transition from alpha 0 to 1 in one second, starting from the moment the load command is called on the webview). On the simulator I have problems to see them too.\n. I'm sorry francesc, could you be more specific?\nSeems to me that you are saying that you see the UIWebView background you have set before the current page is load... which is perfectly normal I think :)\nMaybe you are referring to the open bug in issue #27?\n. Since there's no replay I'm closing this up as \"invalid\"\n. Since there's no replay I'm closing this up as \"invalid\"\n. Added support for links destination anchor. Closed by d9f31ea4909473c3f84e7c0d126b49ec2ca6e133\n. Thank you aldriq for pointing this out!\nI'll commit an improved method as soon as possible :)\n. I've commited the improved method for handling anchors, now it works for both id and name attributes :)\nBe aware that there seems to be an issue with UIWebView: click on link seems to pass from \"shouldStartLoadWithRequest\" only once (ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1840355/uiwebview-shouldstartloadwithrequest-only-called-once). Click on another link or reload the page reset this strange behavior.\nSo, while in Baker we handle hash reference to both id and name attributes now (as W3C standard), the second click on a link is handled by the UIWebView itself, which doesn't seems to handle anchor to name attributes (only outside Safari Mobile... there it all works perfectly).\nI'll look more into this issue, for now I suggest to point hash reference to tag with the id attribute set.\nThank you again aldriq, your suggestion has proved really useful\n. Hi!\nA quick example of an anchor ... let's see ...\n\u2022 put a link link to page 5 in your page 001.html.\n\u2022 in the page 005.html assign the id=\"my-anchor-1\" to an element.\n\u2022 click on the link on page 001.html and the book should go to page 005.html and then scroll down to you element id=\"my-anchor-1\"\nThat's it, nothing more :)\n. It seems that UIWebView has some problems handling the orientationchange event (which on the other hand works perfectly on Safari Mobile).\nSearching around and experimenting a bit I've found something that should do the job.\nTry to add at the bottom of the method\n\n- (void)didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation\n\nthis line\n\n[currPage stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@\"var e = document.createEvent('Events'); e.initEvent('orientationchange', true, false); document.dispatchEvent(e);\"];    \n\nSo, when the UIWebView finish its rotation the event is dispatched correctly.\nThen another problem arise: window.orientation value is always 0 (I think that's why your IMG_WIDTH is always set to 768)\nHow to solve this... well don't check for window.orientation :)\nI think that window.innerWidth is the value you are looking for your image width, so i would go for a script like this:\n\nvar setImgWidth = function setImgWidth() {\n    IMG_WIDTH = window.innerWidth;\n}\nwindow.onorientationchange = setImgWidth;\nsetImgWidth();\n\nThis seems to work like a charm on the iOS Simulator, try it on your iPad and let us know how it goes. Rember that this is only a quick fix, probably the performances aren't like the ones of a Safari Mobile page... but better off with this than nothing right?\n. Thank you very much for pointing out this little glitch and testing the solution provided.\nCan't wait to see your finished magazine :D\nI'm leaving this discussion up as a reminder, since I'll like to polish the solution proposed a little bit and then include it in the core of Baker :)\n. A little update on this matter: I've included in the RootViewController the support for the \"orientationchange\" event and fixed the \"window.orientation\" property value (if checked now return 0 / 180 for portrait orientation normal / upside down and -90 / 90 for landscape orientation left / right, as it should be).\nI hope this help, thanks ffranke to point out the UIWebView glitch :)\n. Since the problem seems solved I'm closing up this issue.\nIn case new problems arise on the orientation matter feel free to open other more specific issues\n. Since this problem seems to be solved I'm closing this issue up.\nThanks to nadzree and albertosarullo for pointing our this problem and provide a good solution :)\n. Could you please check that the value of \"Target Device Family\" in the active target build setting is equal to \"iPhone/iPad\"? \nBy default Baker framworks targets only iPad, so if you try to deploy it on a device that's not an iPad you'll receive an error (the same one you are reporting).\n. I've also cloned a clean copy of Baker and tried to deploy it on my iPhone through a fresh install of Xcode4: after setting the right device family (and the base SDK, switched from iOS 4.2 to iOS 4.3) it just worked. \nSo... another things that comes to my mind is the iOS installed on your iPod: which version it is? By defaul we target iOS 4.2 (and up on iOS 4.3 Baker seems to work like a charm :D ) so, if you have an older version, probably you'll get the same error.\n. Since I'm unable to reproduce this problem on my own, may I ask you if you can provide the Baker package that seems to trigger this unusual behavior?\n. Maybe I wasn't too clear, sorry.\nSince I'm unable to reproduce this behavior with a pristine clone of Baker and also no other user had this problem before, I'd like to see your clone of Baker, the code you have tried to deliver on the iPod.\nBeing able to see it may help me to spot the flaw that prevent you to install Baker on your device :)\n. We change all the occurence of \"userDidSingleTap\" to \"userDidTap\" in the commit b07433, so maybe you should check your local repository :)\n. Well, you can change the \"initPageNumbersForPages\" method in the RootViewController and, instead of creating and attaching UILabels with page numbers, you can attach your own images.\n. Well, maybe you should user an UIImage object instead of a NSString.\nCheck the UIImage Class Reference from Apple iOS Dev Library :)\n. You're welcome :D\n. Hi!\nEvery component you can add in a .xib file it's also manageable programmatically.\nIf you want a tab bar there's the UITabBar class\n. Uhm... that's weird indeed.\nOther than cleaning the project have you also tried to delete the app from iOS Simulator? Sometimes reinstalling the app over a previous installation lead to these kinds of error.\nIf this don't help... well, I'm sorry but without seeing the .html set that caused the problems I'm a bit clueless :)\n. Hi comfused!\nWith the actual version of Baker you can do something like that with the aid of the \"downloadable books\" feature.\nYou can bundle inside your Baker app a book with just one page, which contains all the link to the other books.\nA tap on one of those link will start the download of the \"new\" book and at the end will open it; the book then will be navigable like a normal Baker book.\nIn each book a link to book://local must be provided, which, when clicked, will return the user back to the main bundle book.\nThat would be a simple solution for you case, the only drawback is that now Baker doesn't store more than one book at a time: when you return to the bundle book the last downloaded book is deleted, so every time you switch from a book to another you'll have to download it.\n. I've just added the page titles in the loading screens, just below the page numbers, as in Laker Compendium by @ffranke.\nSome feedbacks before closing this up are appreciated as usual :)\n. Hi Amegalla,\nseems like a rendering problem by iOS.\nCould you send us the page in question?\nWe would like to see and test it, maybe we could come up with a solution :)\n. Hi,\nI've wrapped up your page in a simple html doc and tested it on both Baker and Safari:\n\u2022 on Baker, while I didn't have any problem in scrolling the page up and down (the scroll was fast and smooth as usual) I saw that the rendering of the page took at least 6-7 seconds on my device (iPad 2). I think the problem is in the rendering of the arabic characters, in fact ...\n\u2022 on Safari mobile the page seems to render much faster, almost instantly, but after that the scrolling of the page won't work for about 4-5 seconds.\nI'm sorry, but I think the only solution here is to divide this page in multiple smaller pages, starting with two and going for more if the problem persists.\nI hope this help.\n. Hi Maxhodges!\nI'm sorry but I haven't understand if you need to have the results of your quizzes/survey directly in the application or on a remote server.\nIn the first case you'll need to implement a way to actually save/load data from the html page in the application, since web pages are reloaded every time the user swipe to another page. I'd probably look into HTML5 local storage feature or in a SQLite database.\nIn the second case you will need a server to handle the user data, then a simple js ajax call when the user \"submit\" his answers should do the trick, but of course this would work only if the device is connected to the net.\nUnfortunatley I haven't got any specific example or tutorial for you, but you can find a lot of good ones for both cases on google.\nWell, if you want to learn jQuery you can look at http://jqapi.com/, an alternative and well organized jQuery documentation which I've found very useful :)\n. If you want to know specifically how that was done you may try to contact the publisher.\nHowever you can setup a navigation bar like the one on those magazine in the latest version of Baker: simply put an index.html file with your navigation bar and Baker will handle the rest :)\nMore in this feature can be found here: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/17\n. Sure! Since image maps are supported in Safari mobile they should work well within Baker too :)\n. As I answer to Romain on the Laker website commenting [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[request URL]] will cause all the external link (if any) clicked on the page to be opened in the current UIWebView.\nOf course if there aren't any link that point outside your Baker book this should really do the trick nicely.\nThe best solution I can think of is to recognize and handle an iframe request separately and load it in the UIWebView, while send all the other ones to Safari Mobile\u2026 but of course it\u2019s easier said than done :)\n. Ok, with the commit bd24c19270cbe53923c7585fde24fda355a188f1 external url are loaded inside Baker, so there should be no more problems with iFrames. To go on Safari Mobile just add to the url the param referrer=Baker.\nTest on this feature are kindly appreciated :)\nThanks\n. Ok, with the commit 46825733e540b07bb70c590a3757636ebb2dd9ff I should have fixed the problem.\nThank you for pointing it out, please let me know if now all work correctly :)\n. Thank you for the support :)\n. With the commit bd24c19270cbe53923c7585fde24fda355a188f1, since I review the handling of loading request, I fix this up too. Now a click on the link page_01.html on the page_01 should correctly reload the page :)\n. I'm sorry but if an app is restricted to Portrait only the lock applied also to all the videos, even if they are played in fullscreen.\nCurrently orientation lock work right this, I can't think of a different way to implement it to handle fullscreen videos.\n. To be completely clear:\n\u2022\u00a0Now there's a delay of 0.5 sec between the change of a page and its loading. The delay is necessary to check if the user is tapping more than one time.\n\u2022 The delay of 0.5 sec is also the time necessary for the scrollview animation to be complete. Starting the loading of a page before the animation is completed cause severe slowdowns.\nRemoving the delay may be a way to improve page loading speed, but up to know loading pages to quick is really heavy on the device. Further testing is needed.\n. Hi,\nactually is not the snapshot that is \"locked\", is the page, let me explain:\n\u2022 when the snapshots aren't available each time a page is loaded then it's locked in place to give the application the time to snapshot it.\n\u2022 when the snapshots it's taken it's attached to the background and remain there, the page is unlocked and the user can resume the navigation as normal.\nThe locking of the page is why sometimes the page are unresponsive: if the context of the page change while the snapshot is taken the operation fails (usually a completely white or black image is the result).\nSo the \"locking\" is kinda mandatory, one possible solution may be to taken all the snapshot in advance (preloading all the page and taking snapshots before the book is shown) with the result of having a longer initialization but no delay during the navigation.\nAbout the snapshot staying there to long ... well, that's the native time the webview take to load and render a page: the loading of the page start as soon as the scrolling animation finish, with no added delay, and it's natively managed by the webview component. I guess that, even with local content, the webview remains a bit slow.\nOf course there's the \"three card\" flag: activating it disable the snaphot taking, no need of them if the previous and the next page are preloaded outside the screen, but there are other problems, like the on depicted on issue #122.\nI hope this explain how Baker work now: we are really trying to improve the navigation and the snapshot seems like a good solution. Of course any idea or suggestion in this direction is appreciated :)\n. You should definitely try the three cards method, since the effort to do so is only to change that boolean flag.\nBe aware that we are still working on that, so every feedback or bug report is really appreciated.\nThank you :)\n. You could try to enable pagination on the webView.\nin the loadSlot:(int)slot withPage:(int)page method, try adding ...\n  ((UIScrollView *)[[webView subviews] objectAtIndex:0]).pagingEnabled = YES;\nnear the end, just before [scrollView addSubview:webView];\nI didn't test it too well, so I don't know if there something else to fix or adjust ... but seems to work just fine :)\nLet us know if this can help.\n. Fixed with commit 3c85f4ef8daf5ab87924a2089405429d10fa8a52\nNow all should work correctly :)\n. Hi,\nthe screenshots we are addressing in this issue are the one used as a background when a user turn a page if baker is set to run in \"screenshot\" mode.\nWhat you are asking is a completely different feature, that we might considering adding in a future release.\nIf you want you can open a specific issue about it where we can move the discussion forward.\nThank you.\n. Thank you for your solution, it actually seems to work pretty well :)\nThe problem is that with this solution there's a problem with the page screenshots.\nAs soon as everything is fixed I'll commit everything up ;)\n. Ok, I've implemented the fix suggested by nruffilo in the branch \"white-flash-fix\".\nThe problem with the solution is that by setting webview.opaque = NO and webview background transparent you'll be seeing the content under the page (page screenshot, user background or plain black) when the webview bounce.\nSince there's not a clear moment to reset those property in this fix I try to reset them when the user try to scroll the webview the first time.\nPlease try this and let us know how it goes :)\n. Since no one has provided any feedback about the fix we can't merge it on the master branch yet\nWe really need your feedback about this, so please checkout the \"white-flash-fix\" branch and let us know if it works for you :)\n. Seems that the fix works, finally.\nI've merged the white-flash-fix branch into master with the commit c10b2dc40f7deacf8f11c7c98296c449a28457be\nThank you all for the testing and support :)\n. Probably the white line you see is your book background, try to change it's color and check if the line change color too.\nIf that's the case then check if your page body is long enough to cover the device screen and has a background different from transparent (otherwise you'll see under it :P)\n. Hi!\nCould you please explain how to reproduce the bug?\nI'll need to know ...\n\u2022\u00a0which rendering mode are you using? (screenshots or three-cards)\n\u2022 where is located the page you are loading in the iframe? (it's an external page or included in a book subfolder)\nAlso I don't understand \"click content in iframe and swap page\", do you mean that you have a link in the iframe that points to another page in the book folder?\nThank you for your help, you're a great tester ;D \n. Closed with commit ff0ed7aeff6a71e22c3fbe074de1066c4053852c\n. The latest version on Baker here on GitHub should compile with both 4.3 and 5.0 SDK and run fine on all the iOS Device >= 4.0 (at least the 4.3 ones, testing on older device is really appreciated :P)\nAs you may be aware there were a little problem on the spinners, but it should have been solved yesterday. Check out the latest version of the repo and give it a go :)\n. As the commit says now when the current page appear the event \"focus\" is dispatched on window and when it disappear the \"blur\" one is dispatched.\nI'm closing this issue now, if problems arise feel free to open a bug issue on the board :)\n. Hi!\nI'm sorry but I can't reproduce your bug, in all my test clicking a link to book://local in a downloaded book revert correctly to the bundle book.\nI think I understand what is happening, but just to be sure can you detail the necessary step to reproduce the bug? Also could you please explain what did you mean with the word \"outside\"? :)\n. Ok, I've seen the problems with the screenshot, (which is kinda funny, since that screenshot is deleted as soon as the downloaded book is closed) ... I'll look into it.\nAbout the switching of books on application kills, I wasn't able to reproduce the bug.\nMaybe it's related to the other issue you have opend on book://local, so let's start understanding that.\n. I've detailed the steps I made to test switching from a bundled book to a downloaded one on issue #232\nWe should continue our discussion about that there while leaving this issue dedicated to the \"ghost screenshot from book://local\".\nBy the way thank you for finding that out :)\n. Actually turned out that the ghost screenshot was instead a remains of the previous book last page :)\nThis was fixed with the commit fa415eeb17013904de48c66aef9d9cf26e1ca933\n. Ok, I've ...\n1. make a link on page 5 to book://localhost/mytestbook.hpub; mytestbook is a Baker book with only one page (so the hpub contains only page-01.html and book.json) and that page has a link to book://local.\n2. install Baker on my iPad (iPad 2 with iOS 5.0.1)\n3. run Baker and go to page 5\n4. click on book://mytestbook.hpub link: mytestbook.hpub got downloaded and opened, its first (and only) page is shown.\n5. close and then kill Baker\n6. reopen Baker: mytestbook is opened and its page is shown (no hang up).\n7. click on book://local link: Baker bundled book is opened and its first page is shown (no hung up).\nI think I've done all correctly but still I can see the application crash, so ...\n- are you sure you are using a pristine clone of Baker, with no change whatsoever in the code?\n- after reading this report, have you got any further suggestion for me to reproduce the bug?\n. Ok, I have updated the code to conform to Apple Data Storage Policy with commit 1c5f82195d.\n- Screenshots of the bundled book taken by Baker are saved in /Library/Caches since they can be regenerated by the application at any time.\n- Downloaded books and their screenshots are saved in /Library/Private Documents since books have to be available permanently until discarted even in offline mode\nBoth screenshots and books directories have the skip backup attribute set on at creation.\nFor details about Apple Policy see Apple Technical Q&A QA1719\nNow this should keep Apple happy and Baker apps safe :)\nAs always any test or feedback (expecially the ones from Apple itself) is kindly appreciated.\n. Hi!\nWe have reviewed the code and all seems nice :)\nWe accept this pull merge: the retina screenshots work without any problems on iPhone 4+ and JSONKit seems to be considerably faster than TouchJSON :P\nThank you for your hard works, we really appreciate your effort to improve Baker :D\nThis closes #239\n. Path to the screenshots folder should be relative to the book, try \"-baker-page-screenshots\": \"images/screenshots\" :)\n. That's quite strange, let's see ...\nCould you please put your .hpub on your local machine and see if the link works in your local browser, Safari Mobile and then Baker?\nAssuming that you want to mantain the folder hierachy:\n\u2022 the link to download the package via browser should be \"http://address-to-local-machine/comics/comic1.hpub\"\n\u2022 the correct link for baker should be \"book://address-to-local-machine/comics/comic1\"\nAh, another things, maybe a little useless, but ...\nAssuming you are using a Mac check your book package info (cmd+i) and see if the file name is \"comic1.hpub\" and not \"comic1.hpub.zip\" ... I've fallen for this more than once, so I think it's worth taking a look :P\n. This is a really nice improvement, thank you!\nMerging right now ...\n. Hi urquinaona!\nPreview images, or page screenshots as we usually call them, are taken by Baker as soon as a page is loaded for the first and then stored for future usage.\nIf you change a page its screenshot, if already taken by baker, doesn't change. To update the screenshots you have to delete them and have Baker regenerate them anew.\nDeleting the app of course remove all the screenshots :)\nIf you want you can provide all the screenshots for your book manually, you just have to take them, include their folder in your book and then specify the folder path in the \"-baker-page-screenshots\".\nTo take the screenshots for you Baker book you can use ... well, Baker :)\nFollow this guide on our wiki, you'll find all the info you need to accomplish the task.\n. Hi!\nHere you can find the wiki page that explain everything you need to knwo abour pre taken screenshots.\nTo answer your question Baker screenshot generated by iOS simulator are in the folder /Users/username/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/simulator version/Applications/application identifier/Library/Private Documents/baker-screenshots/, where ...\nusername is your username on your Mac :)\nsimulator_version is the version of the simulator where you've installed Baker (usually 5.0 or 4.3.2)\napplication identifier is a string of chars generated by Xcode (es: 5000955B-BD09-496E-93E2-9D5CACCD2D65)\n. I'm sorry but on iOS is impossible to play multiple media element at the same time.\nTaken from developer.apple.com:\nMultiple Simultaneous Audio or Video Streams\nCurrently, all devices running iOS are limited to playback of a single audio or video stream at any time. Playing more than one video\u2014side by side, partly overlapping, or completely overlaid\u2014is not currently supported on iOS devices. Playing multiple simultaneous audio streams is also not supported. You can change the audio or video source dynamically, however. See \u201cReplacing a Media Source Sequentially\u201d for details.\nsource\n. Sorry, but I wasn't able to reproduce the problem by setting \"-baker-vertical-bounce: false\" in our test book, so maybe the problem did comes from elsewhere :)\nHave you tryed to turn off the javascript on your pages and see if the problem remains ?\nAlso what do you mean when you say enable \"vertical-bounce\" for both modes ?\n. Fixed with pull request #343\n. Ok, just checked the pull request and seems a really well done job ;D\nMerging now\n. Hi Sengkit!\nWell, without seeing the actual pages its kinda hard to tell what the problem may be :)\nI suspect that the slideshow is somehow altering the page width ... but it's really just a guess. \nMy advice it's to:\n\u2022 try to remove the slideshow completely and check to see if the problems on swipe is solved. \n\u2022 try to implement the slideshow with different js libraries, to see if the problems are related to a specific implementation.\n\u2022 try to add to the slideshow one image at a time, to see if and when the problem arise.\nOne last thing: if you could provide us a sample book with five sample pages, two of them with the \"swipe-to-gap\" problem, we could try to track the problem down.\n. I'm glad you solved the problem, hope to see your book on the app store anytime soon :)\n. Thanks for the segnalation, we'll look into this as soon as possible :)\n. Ok, this should be fixed with the commit bb0203f60492103608d8d1340dacfdc3cf92c0e1\nCould you test it and see if it works as expected before I close the issue?\nThank you :)\n. I've done a quick check and I noticed that window.orientation is wrong in the modal webview.\nThanks for the segnalation, we'll work on a fix as soon as possible :)\n. With the above commit I've fixed the window.orientation property in the uiwebview in the modal view.\nI've also checked the page device pixel ratio and width and they both seems correct. \n. Thank you for the segnalation, I forgot to set the correct window.orientation when page finish loading :P\nFixed with commit e21cb2b9e3ddb8bd02e0966ccf79483a35d3de82\nNow, if you want to do some testing I suggest this script:\n``` javascript\n\n    window.addEventListener('orientationchange', function() {\n        alert(\"orientation: \" + window.orientation);\n    });</p>\n<pre><code>setTimeout(function() {\n    alert(\"orientation: \" + window.orientation);\n}, 10);\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n```\nWith this you'll see an alert spawning when the page finish load (actually 10ms after the page load) and everytime you rotate your device/simulator.\nThe 10ms delay is there to give Baker the time to adjust the correct orientation, which normally is always 0 due to a UIWebView bug.\n. Hi bahmet,\nI'm sorry but I wasn't able to reproduce the issue, I tried your code with Baker and anchors worked as expected.\nCan you try again in Xcode and report what the debug console logs when you click an anchor?\n. Uhm, I see no problems there ... the line \n\n2012-04-19 12:54:54.004 Tu\u0308rkc\u0327e Ac\u0327\u0131klamal\u0131 Kuran-\u0131 Kerim[290:15203] \u2022 Scrolling page down to 11854\n\nmeans that the js command to scroll down the page to the element referenced by the anchor is correctly dispatched.\nMy advice is to try turning off all the scripts on the page and see if the anchor works.\nIf that's the case, then turning them on one by one and should reveal which of them is the cause of the problem.\n. Hi!\nI've looked into the problem: seems that custom url schemes weren't handled correctly.\nI've fixed it with commit 73032c2ac57a2550a8adb1550377736fe5e822fb, now all should work just fine :)\n. Hi Krzychu!\nSince we don't know what changes you may have done to the code it's kinda hard to tell if is a bug of our framework master branch. As soon as you'll publish the code, if the problem persists, we'll look into it.\nI actually may have an idea of what your problem is: since in Baker 3.2 the webview background is transparent (it was necessary to fix the annoying flash page bug) maybe the gray color you see is the back of the webview.\nCould you please check if the body of your pages has a background color and, if not, check if setting one solves the problem?\n. Thank you for your pull request, especially for the user agent setter: it's really awesome :)\n. Hi Rodrigors,\nwe acknowledge the bug and we've started looking for a solution.\nI cannot give you a precise date for the fix, but as soon as we have one we'll push it on :)\n. Hi Anjimi!\nI've seen the behavior you're talking about.\nThe only suggestion I can give you is:\n\u2022 Try reducing the size of the images\n\u2022 Try takeing the screenshots with the iPad simulator and include them in your book\n\u2022 Try use three-cards mode.\nUnfortunately it's pretty difficult to work on this problem right now, since we are in the middle of a code refactoring.\nProbably the fix will come with the refactored version of Baker, stay tuned for updates :)\n. Hi f3r3nc,\nThe module 2 was my fault: with that condition the status and index bar visibility are toggled every 2 taps, even if you keep tapping continuously. With touch.tapCount == 2 the toggle happens only after the first 2 taps, to make it work again you have to stop tapping and make another double tap.\nSadly I haven't foreseen the toggling bug while long tapping, which is pretty bad :P\nWith the commit 50fb4d684256a030c1fc46acb66463485da386b7 I've changed the condition and fixed the problem.\nThank you for pointing out the solution :)\n. With the commit f4e332398771514a64ffee92898b30c2a61e5f3d orientation in iOS6 should work properly again.\nTest it out and let us know the results :)\n. I forgot to tell that for now the fix is only on the Master branch ... but I guess you already found it out :)\n. Thanks for the hint nin9creative, it turned out to be a simple overlapping of issue views inside the same shelf cell. Empty the cell content before adding the issue view seems to solve the problem.\n. You are both right, thanks for pointing out the version mistake :)\nThe Baker Shelf version without newsstand should works on iOS 4.3+ devices, but since newsstand require iOS 5+ we'll raise the deployment target to that.\nThose who wish to support lower version of iOS we'll be responsible to set the correct target.\n. Closed with 3a794f3f9abe691510b547c2aa418f93c701e6a1\n. ",

I'll try and find some time to experiment with this over the weekend.\n. OK, <body onLoad=\"window.scroll(0,200)\"> works and there's no jump when the page loads. This still feels a bit clunky to me though because if the reader scrolls down and then flicks back to the top of the page, it obviously doesn't stop scrolling until the navigation is revealed. I'm sure there must be a more elegant HTML/JS solution to the navigation issue though so I'll give it some more thought :)\n. ",

The textured background is the last svdgraff modificated version ;-)\n. I think it's a good choice to define the order in a configuration file as you said svdgraaf.\nHave considered the possibility that it might be multi language? in that case I think that may complicate that order it just by numbers.\n. hello!\nIf the bottom navigation is contained in an HTML, I think that the authors will have more versatility.\nWe could create a navigation as simple or complex as required by the design ... thumbnails, photo and text, just text, etc. \nBesides if we do not put the nav.html, we do not have navigation.\nFor the standard hpub, I think we could create a base template within nav.html (button text), then be customized if required by the author.\n. I think the good is that each author can customize the content to the maxim. \nPersonally I'm starting to hate the adobe plugin. All magazines are equal! :-(\n. JSON +1\n;-). I like it \n. I think the html5 is the best option.\nI personally prefer multiple files with hyperlinks.\n. Sorry, I meant multiple HTML files.\n.

More than one levels, could we getting a multiple hpub document? \n...many hpubs within an unic hpub.\nExamples:\n- Several issues of a book.\n- Monthly magazines.\n  ...\n. @folletto\nCase B .3\nif there is a toc.json and contains the complete list of html pages, which are not in the toc should not be shown at the end. An author may need to load pages in an iframe and therefore these pages are not navigable. :-)\n. perfect!  :)\nCase A +1\n. if we use a metadata file (xml-json), we could evaluate all versions and compare with the server so we can know what the latest version for download.\nAfter downloading the book_XXX.zip, when unzip it could override the metadata file with a new and updated that we have inside the zip.\n. I think that I did not explained very well .. My English is not very good, sorry: (\n- Web server:\n1 - Last updated version.json/xml file, with historical versions. (name / uri / date / version comments / \u00bf?)\n2 - book_versionXXX.zip file\n- Mobile application (ipad / iphone)\nIn the directory, we have with the rest of html the toc.json/xml and within it a attribute with the current version number.\nTo upgrade, you only have to consult the archive version.json/xml from the server and check if there are a newer version than version attribute from toc.json/xml. If so, download the lastest zip. \n:)\n. I think it's better to have two files.\nIf we use the same toc.json to check versions, we should have a version history inside :(\nOther thing... if we have many pages / content in the same toc archive, the file may become heavy.\nI think the toc only have to contain the current version.\nOn the server, we have a file (versions.json) that contains only  a history of upgrades and allow me to check and download the latest version.\nserver:\nhttp://example.com/bookname_versionXXX.hpub \n(internally contains the toc.json with which we can check future upgrades)\nhttp://example.com/versions_bookname.json \n(just to check for updates)\n. I like your solution .. I thought that we could get the URI from the version.json, but is probably best to change it as you say.\n:)\n. Hello! that good news ..\nOnly one question, if you use a js+css navigation on each page, switching to a new page refresh occurs right?. That's what I wanted to avoid a separate html page.\nIt will be great to see your demo with jqmobile ^^\n. Exactly! That's the good thing about this ^^\n. Hey @ilovemac, thanks for sharing your example!\nSeem to be missing some files or directories such as:\nbook / css / handle.png\nbook / gfx / toolbar_bkg.png\nbook / js / images / ajax-loader.png\nbook/Js/images/icons-18-white.png\nI think it's a great choice to work with jqtouch or jquerymobile, but basically limited to use css and js for each page separately.\nI think it does not solve the global navigation for hpub.\n. Is not necessary for me @ilovemac, but it would be interesting for others to appreciate your full demo.\nI simply commented that it is a good graphics solution for html, but that does not help to have an independent global navigation. ;-)\n. I understand ..\nJust what I was thinking to make the journal more accessible.\nI understand that I could change in the css the fontsize in the html itself .. but it would be very inconvenient to have to change it on every page.\nPerhaps with a native configuration option we can keep a trademark for the application to load a new css with font size changes or a new accessible design.\n. I'll look :-)\n. It seems that no written cookies in the app.  :-(\nAny ideas?\n. I do not know if I'm complicating this. but I imagine an author who has multiple numbers, it would be interesting not generate more than one app in the appstore.\nWhat do you think?\n. truth!\nmmm .. now I'm thinking that I could download a zipped hpub as @svdgraaf was preparing. :-P\n. Could it be creating an initial configuration document? I imagine an XML node for each page, you could set the background color and the color of the number as attributes.\nOptionally you could use XML to control some other application parameters.\n. I think it's good to have a configuration file with default values and then the player could to read it, depending on their capabilities use it or not.\nIt comes to my head the mp3 metadata, initially was not used by many players and then has been implemented at all.\nI understand what he says @ jeffehobbs, if you put a black background in the html you will see that it is not very aesthetically change pages. \n. for a background color I recommend to use this class of Jonas Schnelli\nhttps://github.com/jonasschnelli/UIColor-i7HexColor\nis very simple to use and supports hexadecimal color with transparency.\nI used it as a test in Baker changing the white background color and page numbers colors, and it was very simple to implement.\n:)\nlabel.textColor = [UIColor colorWithHexString:@\"ff0000\"]; // red color\n//or\nlabel.textColor = [UIColor colorWithHexString:@\"f00\"]; // red color\n//or\nlabel.textColor = [UIColor colorWithHexString:@\"ff000055\"]; // red color with some alpha \n. hi @Xm4s!\ntested in ipad with 4.2\nworks OK with portrait mode, but the jumping is not fix with the landscape mode. \nI supose that  the problem are in this line with the 1024:\ncurrentPageMaxScroll = size.height - 1024;\nif I change the 1024 for 768 works in landscape but not in portrait mode ;-)\nDid you use the @svdgraaf last version?\nhttps://github.com/svdgraaf/baker/commit/bf0409a2f461c0cb664b3b631a84ff739dc0f988\n. OK :)\nI've tested your changes to the master in @svdgraaf version, that I think should be included in the master. ;-) works very fine!\n. ",

    "jeffehobbs": "I have no input on this other than to say: Adding these features is really cool!\n. I see a brief, almost imperceptible flash of the content of the previous page when I swipe between pages. (iOS 4.2 iPad).\n. Flexible and elegant!\n. In the iPad simulator, the status bar now toggles during internal link-based navigation. The status bar works as expected during swipe-based navigation.\n. For a short term production fix, I wound up commenting out the toggle status bar function call in the source code, so the status bar always shows.\n. Works great for me. It would be really useful to keep this flexible to all the user to launch out to the other iOS custom URL schemes, but this is a tremendous first step. Thanks so much!\n. Yep, just tested with Twitter's \"tweetie:\" custom URL scheme and it worked just as you'd hope. Cool!\n. Really good point about the \"online only\" nature of embedded maps (I envisioned the maps as part of a travelogue). I imagine the bounce out is due the outlying nature of the way iOS handles links to the maps.google.com domain.\n. That XML file might be a good place to put optional index metadata (thumbnails, chapter/page titles, etc.) as well.\n. As to what @folleto is saying above, I strongly agree on both points, and especially that the hPub standard should be as simple as possible (but not more so!). \nHaving said that, a completely optional preferences.xml document in the spec specifying some advanced features like background color(s) or content index would not be a bad thing. This product is going to be judged next to more advanced commercial offerings by Adobe etc. and should stack up competitively whenever possible.\n. Very cool! Thanks for following up, I am amazed and impressed at the progress Baker is making.\n. I would say your thinking is sound -- remove the multi tap feature. As Baker pages become more complex, render and display speed is going to be more and more critical, and as you say, the navigation bar is going to improve the overall reading experience. \n. ",

Hey, i'm new  here, sorry if i'm not already at the same speed of all of you.\nI've developed a simple page with audio inside. It's html5, mp3, and with standard html5 works.\nThe problem, or better the feature needed, is that the reader can't change page without stopping the audio / video.\nI understand this can bring the discussion far from the direction of this thread, but I'm working to find a solution to have audio / video without iframes even changing the pages. Is someone working on this matter ?\n. Yes, this is what I was thinking about. Could be an extension of HTML: [a href=url target=_player]with or without text[/a] Loading the page the app should show a play button at the bottom of the screen, for example. This is the idea. I'll try even if I'm a newbie in C.\n.

Uhm. Ithink that the problem (for apple) is that you sell books by paypal and it's available also on pdf on your platform. My first answer is: we have to think at a dinamically changing text, so they can't say it's a book. Hpub, for example. We can even think at tools to cusotmize on the fly the html. Just some thougths.\n. :-) there's another solution: tools. I know you wnat the user interface minimalist,and it's a good idea, so instead of having the default ui, we could think at a second level, a second layer, a second browser, on the top, with show/hide functions, to be customized in html, something similar to navigation.html, but always on. We could use for twitter, for audio player, video player, and so on. Could be a tools.htm. Or could be the same navigation.html ... Why not...\nThis second page, 'always on' but with some show hide functions, could be 'linked' to the chapter we're reading with some commands, perhaps even a simple link, sharing cookies, with embeds from the web.\nJust ideas :-) \n. Yes: it's not easy. I don't know italian publishing houses on ibookstore. In last 6 months there are some on the web, and they are starting now to sell some hundreds of books from their own websites. \n. Faced with the same issue. After first download and install, it all worked well with no flashes. Then I changed -baker-vertical-bounce to false, re-compiled and the white flash re-appeared. Baker 3.1 on iOS 5.0.1 (iPad 1).\n. This will helps you. Find in RootViewController the function toggleStatusBar and comment the lines i put you in this code\n\n```- (void)toggleStatusBar {\n    NSLog(@\"\u2022 Toggle status bar visibility\");\n```\nUIApplication *sharedApplication = [UIApplication sharedApplication];\nBOOL hidden = sharedApplication.statusBarHidden;\n[sharedApplication setStatusBarHidden:!hidden withAnimation:UIStatusBarAnimationSlide];\n//if(![indexViewController isDisabled]) {\n    //[indexViewController setIndexViewHidden:!hidden withAnimation:YES];\n//}\n```\n}\n\n. It runs for me, is quite simple, I dont understand what happens with this code and your project, but it works\n. Ok, luck with it. I like so much your project!\n. It works fine now!\nCongratulations!\n. I mean the first case of showcases at baker web:\nhttp://bakerframework.com/books\nYou can download the free version to see it\n. I just want to make a link (image for example) where i can show the toggle bar as wel as double tab. Is that posibble?\n. What do you think if i do this with JavaScript into the html page? Is it possible?\n. Thanks :)\n. Hola Carlos, \nPara compilar cualquier programa creado con Xcode tienes que darte de alta como desarrollador de Apple. No hay otra forma.\n. No soy muy experto en el tema. De hecho tuve que hablar con un amigo de un amigo para saberlo hacer. Por lo que pude quedarme con la copla. Primero tuve que crear los certificados para certificarme como desarrollador de Apple. Posteriormente si quieres probar la aplicacion en algun dispositivo tienes que darlo de alta en la parte de Devices. Por \u00faltimo para cada aplicaci\u00f3n tienes que crear un APP ID y de ah\u00ed bajarte el provisioning (el de desarrollo y el de distribuci\u00f3n para poderlo enviar a la applestore) Te hablo de memoria pero mas o menos son estos pasos. Te aconsejo que mires bien la documentaci\u00f3n. Suerte :)\n. Eso es porque despu\u00e9s de instalar el certificado en el proyecto tienes que buscar una opcion que se llama \"Build Sign\" y tienes que seleccionar el certificado que te has bajado.\n. Hay un fork de una versi\u00f3n de Baker que soporta varios hpub en una aplicaci\u00f3n. Con activar la opci\u00f3n  de newstand en el book.json y tal vez alg\u00fan tipo de identificaci\u00f3n por usuario se pueda hacer.\nhttps://github.com/orangesparkleball/baker/tree/multiple-hpubs\n. I am currently working on a template to integrate Unity3D with the baker framework. I'll be blogging about it in a week or so for anyone interested. It might help jump the hurdle of the app approval process for those looking to add that level of content.\n. @folletto Thanks for asking! I was a little distracted by finals, but it's almost done. I'll post it on Monday :-)\n. Reply from Davide\nTwo quick pointers that might help:\n1. The book wasn't there because once unzipped Baker deletes it to avoid consuming too much space.\n2. Check if: you zipped the BOOK content and not the BOOK folder (subtle but critical difference) and if you did remove any Mac \"dot\" (.name) file (there might be a \".book.json\" file).\n. I actually zipped the folder instead the content, that was the problem.\n. Thanks, @folletto.

I was just getting ready to try to publish with the older version like anjimi was. Where would you like me to contact you that we want to be part of the 4.0 launch? I may have many questions and I am more than willing to to help with feedback.\n. @tstegart if you are able to test the downloaded magazine/book on an iPad through Xcode while plugged into the compter, you can grab screen shots through Xcode.\n. Yes but it immediately downloads it.\n. @nin9creative It validates at both sites\n. With your comments I got the app to run and download my magazine. \nFor those who are looking back, it was my JSON file, it was missing some brackets. Pointing it to the test JSON helped thank you @Simbul \nMy next issue is when I try to read the magazine I'm getting the Path to the index view is (null). Is there a change to the hpub setup for 4.0 that I am missing? One thing I did notice is the book protocol isn't supported by 4.0 you are to use 3.2.x instead. If that is the case what should I use? \nIn my set I added one of the baker sample books to my list to help me with testing, so that is showing up too. It downloads and reads okay. I am unable to see how that hpub file is set up. I look at the sample book that downloads with the 4.0 framework. My set up is the same and the JSON file is the same.\nNot sure what I'm missing.\nany ideas?\nIf this should have a new issue opened, let me know.

I then took the downloaded Baker sample .hpub file changed it to a zip file, unzipped it, zipped it back up, changed it back to a .hpub file and placed that on my server. It downloaded fine, went to read it and no go. This looks like it's the way I am zipping the files. Is there something special I should be doing to zip the file to make the .hpub file?

I think if you are a subscriber, free or otherwise, it will automatically download a new issue in the background, when one comes out without you (the customer) having to do anything.\n. I'm not finding an icon within my magazine for the link to go to Safari instead of the link opening inside my magazine. When I am on the web page that opens within my magazine and Baker Shelf, I'm not finding any icon either. When I scroll to the edge of the opened webpage that's in my magazine and go a little further it slides to the next page in my magazine. If I then swipe back it goes to the original page that had the link on it. I am using the 4.0 framework. I probably should have mentioned that in the title.\n. @folletto  it is doing it with all and every link that is set up in the .hpub (magazine) file.

Such as showing a drop-down menu, navigation bar, etc.\nWas the tap-to-show the status bar just a way of demonstrating that taps can be caught and processed?\n. When we restart the iPad, does the downloaded book get erased from memory?\n. Yahoo! issue #8 has been resolved and closed!\nHow were you thinking of doing a footer navigation?\n- iOS code to read-display contents of an XML table of contents file?\n- iOS code that shows our HTML table of contents file within a URLWebView?\n- iOS code that displays the file listing from the book folder?\nThank you!\n. For those who would like to use Baker as a framework for magazines, each hpub would be a publication of the magazine.  The same for a product catalog, each hpub would be a different product or section of the overall catalog.\nIt would be very nice if the Baker Framework could hold multiple hpub packages. \nThank you!!!\n. Now that we can replace the internal \"book\" with an externally downloaded book, the contents can easily grow and be replaced.  The HTML could have an Index page that one can link to different sections.  That would be the workaround for having only one book in the app.\nWe still have a need for multiple books within the app.\nPriority for it is lower than other features.  For example, the Landscape orientation should be done first.  This request has a suitable workaround already.\n. Yes -- I agree with this bug report!\n1.  Swipe to see the next page\n2.

I only know enough to ask questions and make possible suggestions.\nThank you for such a nice framework, a few more features and fixes will make it such a valuable tool !!!\n. That is interesting that memory is a constraint.\nI embedded Magaka into Baker, it was able to swipe through the pages with no delay.  Within the book folder, I changed Magaka's index.html to Chapter 01.html.  Then it simply ran fine.\nPlease note that Magaka handled the page transitions and page displays.  Baker only knew about a single page, the Chapter 01 page.  All other pages were handled by the Magaka JavaScript framework.\nSo perhaps it is possible to buffer the next and previous pages.\nI too will ask a few iOS developers if they know the solution.\n. Wow -- that is awesome you were able to make the old page flash go away within Baker!\nCould you send me your file?  That way, I won't have to rely upon my poor coding skills.  (it looks funny due to the text formatting in the comment area, I fear something may have been deleted)\nI have sent you a private message with my personal email address.  I'll test it out!\nThanks!\n. Just for completeness, I tried it on the actual iPad -- it works !!!\n:-)\nFor those following along, do the above steps 1-11\nWonder why it does not do it properly on the iOS Simulator?\nI changed the title of the issue to show that its a problem with the iOS Simulator and that it partly works on the iPad.\n. When the book download occurs, the old book is deleted and the new book replaces everything.  However, it seems the old pages are not completely deleted, they remain as ghosts.\nIf the book originally had 12 pages, and the new book has 12 pages, then the total page count is 24.\nHowever, only the new 12 pages are displayed correctly. The old ghost pages, now renumbered to 13-24, are showing the error message of:\n\"Mac OS X 2 TEXTATTR com.apple.TextEncodingUTF-8;134217984\"\nI am not a skilled iOS developer, thusly, I try to be a good tester.  I'll look at the code to see if I can find the bug.\n. Hello Xm4s,\nIt is fixed, thank you for the very quick response!\nI've noticed that you have changed the link on Chapter 3 to be 127.0.0.1 instead of neuro.local -- that is a good idea, I will edit my instructions accordingly.\nThank you!\n. Hello snive,\nCan you share the code that you used? Perhaps zip-up the \"book\" folder and let us download it.\nThank you, this is great achievement!  :-)\n( If it is easier to share the zip, I've given you my email address in a private message -- please check your Inbox on GitHub )\n. My suggestion is to be as flexible as possible. Directories within the \"book\" content are useful to group related files. Why are directories not allowed -- is there a technical reason or is it for another reason?\nHere is my explanation on how we need and use directories. Otherwise, we would have to develop post-processing scripts, which can lead to silly errors.\nWe intend on using Baker as a \"Product Catalog\", not as an eBook or a Magazine.\nOur product information is inside a Content Management System that uses \"directories\" as a way of grouping related information.  An export out of that CMS generates product directories.  Inside each product directory are the files for that particular product.\nA table of contents provides an easy to browse product index -- index_01.html  The index file has a list of each product.  The product links point to the overview.html file within each of the product directories.\nEach product directory has four pages, with these (same) filenames:\n- overview.html\n- specifications.html\n- features.html\n- pictures.html\nThus, our file structure is:\nindex01.html\nproduct1 / overview.html\nproduct1 / specifications.html\nproduct1 / features.html\nproduct1 / pictures.html\nproduct2 / overview.html\nproduct2 / specifications.html\nproduct2 / features.html\nproduct2 / pictures.html\netc. etc. for the remaining products ...\nPlease re-consider the ban on directories. The beauty of Baker is that it is open-ended, allowing it to hold content for many different purposes.\nThank you!\n. Just for early discussion, what are your thoughts for doing a search within the book?\nWhat software would do the indexing and searching?\n. If I was given a choice on this item, my response would be \"This is a nice-to-have feature, but not a need-to-have capability.\"\nCurrently, one can copy-paste the selected text into their favorite Twitter app to send out the tweet.\nI suggest to implement the features that do not have an alternative method to do it in a bit harder-longer way.\nOther than making comments like this, I'm not sure how else to influence the roadmap.\nThank you for the terrific software!\n.

    "aldriq": "Excellent work going on here, I must say!\nI have a quick question hopefully related to these new options. The book I'm currently working on is pretty standard typographically speaking, except (of course there is always one 'except') in one of the appendices there is a large -wide- table. If I was approaching this on a paper book the first think that came to mind was one of these unfoldable pages you'd get in old atlases and encyclopedias, but that seems tricky to achieve in the current framework. \nSo an easier solution could be perhaps to force the page to horizontal orientation. Would that be possible with the new options?\n. Yes, just for one page. I haven't tried the table in a normal page yet, I thought it would just disappear beyond the page limit, but if it lets you scroll then that's fine for me, a much cleaner solution.\n. I guess the main question is whether BakerFramework can/will evolve (or branch out) to a full-blown BakerReader that can hold any number of books, like iBook, kindle or Stanza.\n. I understand, it's definitely a medium/log-term decision. I imagine it also depends on how 'fast' the next hpub standard takes to consolidate.\n. Thanks for all the thorough research, I never thought this would open such a little can of worms... \n.

I just dont understand the crossover between the html5 documents I create to sit within the baker framework object and the classes etc / bits within the directory structure. I need to log up on css3 as Im more familiar with css2. I guess thats really the heart of it understanding where the classes bits discussed above lie in relation to the html5 code that my book sits within. E.g. if I want my book to switch orientation / add navigation to the scenario do I call programmatic elements from within baker, or is it something else I interact with.\nAs mentioned before  I dont understand the relationship between the entiries html5, classes of baker, webkit etc.\nAny assistance would be most welcome as I have programmatic experience Im just in a whole other environment.

    "bru": "suggestion, maybe keep it ordered numerically and add the title of the chapter to the name of the file: 1.intro.html, 2.early_days.html, 3.the_end.html ...\n. as for the thumbnails/icons, something along the lines of the html \"favicon\" seems simple enough. agreed that it probably belongs to a future version of the spec. \n. can confirm that with collaborative efforts (magazines and non-fiction books), being able to bundle and send your contribution to the editor/curator is a common, desirable practice. \nThat said, I'm not convinced that having several ways of determining the order of the files (e.g. alphabebetic, TOC, folders) would make anybody's life easier.\n. to build on that, I'm still making up my mind on the various options, but so far an index(.html) file seems to be the most straightforward, and yet powerful, option: no hidden magic, everything clearly described, and just one place where to access and edit your metadata, ecc.\n. the more I think about it, the more the manifest/index file sounds to me similar to the spec file of a software package, it's contents being a sub(or super)set of:\n- title\n- version\n- author\n- uri\n- summary\n- license (?)\n- author key (? probably not needed / wanted, but it's an option)\n- hpub specification version\nnow, historically this sort of stuff has been achieved in a number of ways: xml, json, programming language objects (think ruby, java), yaml.\nFor the sake of simplicity (e.g. limit the amount of skills required to start publishing books) I'd probably adopt html as a syntax (using meta headers for metadata and the body to define the toc). However, html is definitely verbose when compared to, say, json syntax, which can result in fact easier to read even to humans. \nMaybe some a/b testing is due?\nOr can you see any strong limit in one approach wrt the other? \n. yep, TOC was inherently part of it, as per the rest of the comment.\nAgain, alphabetic sorting may be misleading when there is a toc overriding it, as the toc is \"hidden\" in the manifest file, and users may end up wasting time wondering why the alphabetic convention is not being honored. \n. dc +1\nthat's the sort of stuff I was referring to when I wrote about embedding metadata in the manifest, in case we choose html.\nSimilarly, we can build on metadata elements already available for licensing the work (CC comes to mind -> http://creativecommons.org/choose/) and so on.\nPushing it a bit more (maybe a bit too far), xfn could be used to estabilish relationships with other books (parts of a trilogy? add a parent / sibling relationship). \nBut I think we'd better concentrate on the basics for the time being.\n. @elmimmo: I think that was to address my concern that, if an alphabetic ordering convention exists, you're more likely to get confused the moment the project you're working on uses a toc \"hidden\" in the metadata file.\n. uhm, another little complication to consider is what happens if a toc exists but some of the pages haven't been included in it: shall we visualize them at the bottom? at the start? not at all?\nIn the case of baker, probably the best option would be to raise an exception at compile time and inform the user. But obviously that's not something that can go in a generic format specification like hPub.\n. hm, but then behaviour changes quite a lot (from inferred to explicit toc). naughty.\n. A is cleaner, B is wrong (because the outcome will not, almost certainly, meet the expectation of the user). Still, A means that toc file and implicit ordering are not functionally equivalent. That's the naughty bit. We should probably treat them as two separate cases / tools.\n. hm, how would you exclude files in case no toc is present?\n. brrr. naughty, as I said :)\n. I'm not saying it won't work. I'm saying it's naughty: not crystal clear. Smells like a hack.\n. As already discussed offline, the other advantage of an URI like this would be that it allows for a openID like scheme for authenticating books contents. \n. md5?\n. @folletto: that would require some sort of server logic. \nWhich is ok, but wasn't explicitly declared so far. \nI think we should start form defining the minimum system requirements: in case the author doesn't have the knowledge or the means to put logic on his website, shall he be forbidden to publish books, or do we want to define a fallback protocol?\nIn case of the latter, having the version in the filename for the book archive (the hpub file) probably offers more flexibility, as we could implement this flow:\n1. client checks http://example.com/bookname.json\n2. founds from the json that the latest version is XXX\n3. client decides whether to retrieve the book from http://example.com/bookname.XXX.hpub\nIn this scenario, the client never goes straight to the archive, but always checks the manifest file first.\nOR, now that I think about it, we could re-use a well tested wheel here and do what software ftp services have been doing for ages: symlinking the book endpoint to the latest version:\nbookname.hpub -> bookname.XXX.hpub\nobviously, if the user can afford to have logic on his distribution server, we can do more interesting stuff, still following the simple protocol described above, like honouring the \"?version=XYZ\" convention.\n.

    "frank06": "I asked in another issue why not use Zhook instead of creating yet another e-book format. Unfortunately all those comments are gone with Github's recent outage.\nBasically the argument against Zhook was that it uses one single file instead of many, an is thus less capable or performant. (I'll explain below why I think this isn't really an issue, [1]).\nIn my opinion there is much more to gain from joining forces on a standard, than fragmenting:\n- We're essentially doing the same thing\n- Thought has been put into Zhook, and it's a format already being used (Monocle, Booki.sh, Widescript, ...)\n- Interactivity is something that isn't limited by any of these formats. (As a matter of fact, I just finished authoring a really interactive Zhook -- more than anything I've seen out there)\n- Tools: convert to and from ePub: https://github.com/joseph/peregrin ; also I should be releasing something very handy quite soon\nBaker is a neat idea. It would be perfect if we could pull together towards the same goal, a solid, no-fuss alternative to ePub, making it easier for authors to decide where and how to distribute their content. What do you think?\n[1] I don't remember who answered my last comment, it was said that it was non performant, heavy on memory consumption, etc.  Whilst I don't think this is the case, it could be addressed by splitting files before bundling them into an app... we'll find some sort of solution?  One of the longest books in history, \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" by Victor Hugo weighs in at (only) 4mb of total HTML size; I'm sure there are other problems performance-wise -- which of course need to be measured first.\n. Woah, that's a lot of text to digest.\nI am thrilled to notice that both standards are not that far apart, and that everybody is \"striving for simplicity\". There seems to be, however, some confusion regarding the format's and the reader's concerns.\nThe (not-really-significant) differences boil down to:\n1. One-page vs multi-page\n2. Book-oriented vs magazine-oriented\n3. Cross-referencing\n4. The name\nLet me develop:\n1\nThe pages approaches have their pros and cons (previewability for Zhook, collaboration / \"every page could potentially have a completeley different stylesheet\" for hPub). But seriously, it can be solved either way by running a 3-line shell script as Joseph said.\nA format is merely descriptive. Most of what we're discussing here is ultimately up to the Reading System. Zhook has it down right when it comes to using HTML5 markup to describe structure.\n2\nWe are using Zhook to build highly interactive publications that share many features with magazines \u2013 and don't feel limited in any way by the format. It's flexible... But remember: it's a book. If you want to build an app, check PhoneGap.\nRe: pagination and scrolling: again, up to the reader. Widescript doesn't paginate (we have our reasons) and Zhook works just fine.\n3  I haven't dug enough into cross-referencing, but anyway this can be addressed by something on top of Zhook, like a convention on IDs.\n4 Hopefully not too difficult to solve :)\n. And I'm down for discussing about these topics on an \"ebook-dev\" or similar group. Joseph are you creating one?\n. Yes, let's get practical. This is a Zhook: https://github.com/widescript/dynamo-paper/blob/master/index.html  (just an example).\n@foletto: Observe the <article> tags and imagine how they could be tore apart. It's that simple.\nThat's what we do at Widescript. Each <article> becomes a \"chapter\". Just like in 5x15 \u2013 only with a different navigational model but that's exclusively the Reading System's concern.\nAgain. The difference is simply a tradeoff:\n- One Big File which you can easily preview, but perhaps too big for collaboration\n- Multiple Small Files which you can collaborate better on, but you can't easily preview (unless you copy-paste you <head> tag across all of them).\nThat's it. Both compatible with a tiny shell script to go back and forth between \"Zhook mode\" or \"hPub mode\".\n\"Pixel-perfect\"? Not sure what you mean. <article>s delimit chapters. You can split Zhook's index into multiple pages like this: /<article\\b[^>]*>.*?<\\/article>/ or xpath or whatever.\nIf you mean non-reflowable / Definite Content (http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/) then that's a whole new discussion.\n\nif you want to simply do a stunning portrait photographic book on the iPad, you should be able too\n\nThere's no reason why this can't be done with Zhook. One picture per <article> and the rest is CSS.\n5x15 is totally feasible in Zhook. I can help out if needed.\n. I'm not suggesting that at all.\nI'm not even arguing against multiple files \u2013 that could be a good thing. Even having to copy-paste <head>, etc.\nAll I'm saying is the differences are smaller than you believe. (\"One vs. multiple files\" aside, what else is radically different that makes it worth fragmenting?)\nHow do we move it forward then?\n@segundoseis: HTML5? Both formats use HTML5.\n. This is my concrete proposal. We could build on from here.\nIt is a compromise between both formats. For practical purposes, let's call it NEF (New E-book Format, whatever).\nLet's say NEF is a superset of Zhook, which makes it compatible with hPub.\n- Multiple files are allowed. Ordered lexicographically.\n- Multiple <article> tags are allowed in any page, but not required. If there are no <article> tags in a given page it means the whole page behaves like one big <article>.\n- Metadata placed in the <head> section (as described in the Zhook spec) of several files is merged by the Reading System, removing duplicates.\nCorollaries:\n- A Zhook is a NEF\n- An hPub is a NEF\nExamples:\n- If you go more the Zhook way, you get previewability remaining DRY. I would author a photographic album like this: several <article> tags, including one <img> tag each. Can't get simpler.\n- If choose the hPub way, you get previewability repeating yourself, but with smaller chunks which are best for organization/collaboration. I would write a long book including metadata (<meta> tags) in the first chapter, and have one file per chapter. Much more flexible.\nAuthors would now have the power to build something that can be published virtually anywhere. This advantage comes at the expense of complicating matters a bit, but might be worth it.\nThoughts?\n. Compelling points against alphabetical ordering.\nLinking seems to be the best we've got. If you don't want to mess with \"is this file before or after...\", just use the article tag approach. You should be able to combine multiple files and several articles in a same file, in any degree.\nI would avoid manifest/metadata files. Start adding extra stuff, and you'll end up creating the new EPUB.\nThe beauty of Joseph's proposal is that everything remains semantic HTML (and ultimately yes, I do think ebooks are websites).\n. ",
    "joseph": "I'm going to append some thoughts to Francisco's comment first, and then get back to your specific Zhook questions, folletto.\nFirst, yes, arguments about the performance of file formats are bonkers. They conflate two different problem domains. Here are the respective challenges:\nThe app: be fast\nThe format: be easy to author\nZhook builds in zero requirements for the book creator to be mindful of app-level optimisations. But it does provide a simple algorithm for componentizing its single HTML file into multiple discrete chunks if the reading system desires it (that's what we do with Booki.sh, for instance).\nNow I think there's more than enough room for multiple ebook formats to co-exist. The one-ring-to-bind-them-all can wait another decade at least. But various people have pointed out to me the similar goals between Zhook and hPub, and it seems worth covering how Zhook arrived at its present point. Francisco has done a terrific job, I'll back it up with a few points about why we went single-HTML-file.\nPreviewability. If you have multiple files, it's hard to preview the whole book in a web browser. If you're clever, you can install Firefox extensions that recognise rel links, and pop these in your <head>. Or you could get tricky with a meta HTML file that loads all the components in iframes. But if you want it to be dead-simple for web designers to make books, your best option is a single page.\nWhole-book operations are common when editing. You've probably already discovered that what you tend to do when editing a book is perform batch operations. Some people like simple find-and-replace. Some get serious with regexes. Power developers will use a swiss army knife like Nokogiri. If you spread out across multiple files, things become a chore quickly, and destructive errors creep in.\nYou get structure for free (manifests suck). Obviously this is the most important point. You're looking at JSON to explain the structure of the book and capture its metadata. That's not bad. EPUB uses several byzantine XML files. That's sucky. But what are you really doing here? You're marking up an arbitrarily complex, single document: a book. \nIt turns out that's what HTML is built for. Want to chunk your book into chapters? Or nested sections within sections? Just wrap each discrete component in an <article> tag. Want to have a table of contents? Just give each section a heading: <h1>, <h2>, etc. Want metadata? Use the <meta> tag (or RDF-a for complex metadata).\nAnyway, I had thought that if there was a point of difference between Zhook and hPub, it was reflowability. Zhook has to be reflowable (and paginatable) \u2014 hPub does not. Dismissing that requirement does potentially give hPub a number of affordances that would be worth exploiting. But I see there's been recent work to support multiple orientations and resolutions. Which arrives you at reflowability. At this point, if you'll excuse the pun, there might be some value in pooling our resources.\n. Different interaction models: I see this as a real point of difference. If we decide that HPub is for one interaction model, and Zhook is for another interaction model, it definitely makes sense to shake hands and wish each other well. Can we define these different interaction models? (If it's pagination vs scrolling, fair enough \u2014 my unshakeable opinion is that pagination is essential for long-form text.)\nBook-only: yes, unashamedly. I wouldn't use the word 'subset', but it's not important: we can get together and compare Venn diagrams sometime.\nFocussing on the simplest possible approach to production: then you'll want to get rid of manifests. :)\nNo prescription: that's fine as long as you've only got one reading system. Giving the <html> element a reader-specific ID simply allows book designers to do different things with different reading systems. You can leave it out, but soon enough book designers will beg for it. 100% of our focus with both Monocle and Zhook is on modifying the DOM as little as possible. But if you want to avoid it entirely, at the end of the day you've just built a web browser.\nCross-referencing books: that quote of mine about a \"not particularly significant problem\" is accurate. It hasn't bothered me so far. I think that there are definitely use cases of course, and they simply demand a central registry. Everyone making up their own IDs is just half a solution \u2014 and that's where EPUB currently stands. If you're going down this path, stand on the shoulders of giants and use Keith Fahlgren's work on the topic: http://blog.threepress.org/2010/10/21/developing-an-epub-linking-spec\nCo-working: that \"one big file\" is the HTML. I don't really believe you would have multiple people working on that at the same time \u2014 it's not a workflow that makes sense to me. Now, you might have one person creating semantic HTML while another does CSS and even another does images/scripting/etc, but authoring the book content itself is more or less indivisible. In large-team cases, of course, you can write a 3-line shell script to stitch stuff together. I recommend you optimise for one-person book teams, not big teams. That's the most common case. \nThe difference between a book and a \"whole, complex, feature rich website\" is that a book is a single document \u2014 even when it has multiple sections with quite distinct personalities.\nZhook is no more a single-company invention than HPub. The official spec is a Gist \u2014 by all means fork away! Contributions very welcome.\nNaming: I like HPub better than I like Zhook. Zhook is a ridiculous name! :)\n. Of course I've tried Baker! I've had 5x15 on my iPad since your launch day. It's great, delightfully simple, and yes \u2014 seems to take interaction cues from the recent slew of magazine apps like Wired. I like the design quality. I hope the project isn't jeopardised by Apple's recent decision to ban 'templated' single-title book apps from the App Store.\nMy point about pagination vs scrolling is this: from a reader's perspective, as soon as you have any scrolling, you don't have pagination in a meaningful sense (you might still have article-ization or something). Pagination to a reader means \"give me a screenful of text at a time\". I like to apply the nose test: can I read this using only my nose? :)\nStructure: no, this is really, really important. Of course all popular ebook formats use HTML for markup. Zhook uses it to describe the structure of the book to the reading system. The reading system optionally generates a table of contents from the headings. Components from the article tags. Footnotes from sup'ed links. Metadata from the head. All the meta-information about the book \u2014 everything you're planning to store in the manifest \u2014 is in the semantic structure itself. It's actually simply an outcome of using HTML5.\nWell, here's what I think should happen next. I like Zhook's focus on books. I don't want to widen it to magazines, because I think they have very different problems to books. But I think something really terrific is happening here. Actual reading system developers are coming together and talking about the hard bits. You guys with Baker and HPub, Widescript (frank06) who are using EPUB and Zhook, and us with Monocle and Zhook. I'd really like to see this conversation continue. The environment at the moment is full of opportunites, and it's better to experiment than to try to consolidate things (if anything, this is my primary criticism of the current EPUB3 initiative).\nEPUB3->HPub->Zhook all sit on a conservative/radical continuum of HTML5 ebooks, and it'd be good to share ideas and problems. Maybe some kind of ebook-dev Google Group? To the people here I would add Keith and Liza of Threepress (also reading system developers \u2014 Ibis Reader \u2014 and easily the smart and wisest people in our field), then blaine and augustl, who have both built interesting HTML5 ebook reading systems here on Github, and Hadrien Gardeur, the clever bastard behind Feedbooks.\n. Do you have a practical example of a book that would be difficult/impossible to do as a single-file Zhook?\nBy the way, I love it when things pass the nose test! I hadn't discovered that bit of UI in Baker.\nWhen it comes to URIs, well, here's two URIs illustrating why I think it's a non-issue:\n- http://wind-in-the-ddcb27.reading.a.booki.sh\n- http://www.20thingsilearned.com/html5/1\nMy answer to the question you asked on Twitter is 'http://'. :)\n. But that completely confuses the matter \u2014 unless the file format is tied to the reading system (as might be the case with HPub and Baker), the file format is independent of any one reading system's interaction model.\nYou could absolutely have Zhook as the underlying file format for Baker, where a statement like \"with each page starting and ending where the author decided and not where the reader software wanted\" actually makes sense. \nIn this case, each \"page\" is an article element. Zhook's recommended componentization algorithm does this for you.\nSo it would be quite straightforward to make a Zhook that did what you suggest.\nBut remember that the statement actually only makes sense in the context of an interaction model where you have scrolling pages.\n. Is the source of 5x15 available somewhere? Maybe creating a Zhook would focus the discussion a bit.\n. I like this idea, but I have two suggestions:\n- call the first file index.html, and only get metadata from here\n- rather than ordering alphabetically, use <link rel=\"next\"> to chain subsequent files\nPutting all the metadata in a single place will be easier for book creators. Calling the first file index.html conforms to standard web-server configuration, and therefore has practical benefits. It's also immediately obvious to any web developer which file is the central one.\nSpecifically chaining files together via a link is more \"HTML5\" than alphabetical ordering, and allows two possibilities: HTML files that are not part of the linear flow (such as might be included in an iframe, for instance), and \"remote\" parsing \u2014 that is, parsing where the contents of the directory is unknown, such as when getting a book off the web rather than from a local filesystem.\n. It's strange that you're against a naming convention for the primary file in the book, but in favour of arbitrary rules for all the others (non-linear content must be in a subdirectory, alphabetical order must be preserved).\nI mean, I like that CBR seems to be your inspiration, it's a nice simple format. I written two different comic book viewers over the years \u2014 one in C# and the other in JS. I've seen a lot of broken comics because of the alphabetical ordering requirement. Of course that's trickier to fix in the case of CBR, because augmenting JPGs with sequence data is not for lay-people. We can avoid it here, because HTML is much more informationally rich and editable. All it costs you is one <link> for each linear component. \nTo me, a link tag is the answer to the question: What Would HTML Do? That's the premise of Zhook \u2014 following HTML rules and conventions gives you constantly improving support in all rendering engines (and other HTML consumers, like spiders and web server modules). \nI'm not happy with \"just allow directory listing or add an index.html\" \u2014 the latter is a manifest file in all but name, and the former is the sort of server configuration requirement that impedes adoption.\nIt may seem like an edge case, but this feature gives the file format one massive advantage: streamability. You can ignore the zip packaging altogether and just read your books straight off the server \u2014 either directly in a browser or via a reading system. To me, that's the future of ebooks: a format where the consumer no longer even sees the file. (And that's why I said 'http://' is the answer to your URI question.)\n. ",
    "elmimmo": "Contrary to popular belief, what is alphabetical order is neither obvious nor absolute. Think about when the name contains numbers (or, possibly, accented characters).\nAn example: Two files named \"88.html\" and \"8b.html\" would be ordered differently depending on the app:\n-    In Mac OS X 10.6.4, the Finder and other UI-based apps (such as Simple Comic) consider the appropriate order as 8b.html > 88.html\n-   The Terminal considers 88.html > 8b.html\nThrow non-latin characters into the mix and people do not even know what \"alphabetical order\" means.\nBesides, when creating content, deleting and adding content in beween other content is only natural. Having to change filenames every time that happens would not be a nice thing.\n. Another example of alphabetical order quirks:\n1.  01.html\n2.  01 addendum.html\nYet, the space comes before the period, so pretty much all software likes the following better:\n1.  01 addendum.html\n2.  01.html\n. For whatever reason, Dublin Core (and hence OPF/EPUB too) seem to prefer the nomenclature of \"creator\" over \"author\". Ochook.org seems to like it too for zhooks (at least that is what they use in an example of metadata at http://ochook.org/). No idea if others in the metadata crowd such as MARC or ONIX are on the same boat. Maybe being consistent with already existing metadata nomenclatures, if it does not come in the way, would be useful.\n. I can understand why Joseph thinks rel links are elegant. They are obvious, their syntax simple, follow very established standards (and hence parsers already know what they mean), and are already used widespread. If it ain't broke\u2026\nI think, though, this conversation is at the point of how a human creates the content and defines its structure, which comes before how a machine processes that content. For a human, manually creating/modifying a TOC using rel links, spread in potentially tens of files, is a royal pain in the ass. I do not know if it is a nice thing either for a machine having to open all chapters in order to be able to present a comprehensive TOC, but it does not sound like it would be for low powered devices (I know, Joseph likes the idea of online books, I like it too; but I think offline also has to be considered).\nI see where he is coming from, where in a zhook the human does not actually edit any TOC whatsoever, but simply structures content accordingly in one single file, and then it is the machine that splits the content and fills in those rel links appropriately. But then again, isn't this about how a relation between content split in multiple files is defined first by a human, then by a machine?\nI see little alternative to a manifest file if the content is split in more than one file. Content.opf sucks big time, that I can agree with.\n. @folletto I would not use alphabetical order for my content, because like I said I find it unpredictable and difficult to modify, but I am just as happy with the rule \"if TOC exists use the TOC; else use alphabetical order\".\n. Yet, reading your example, why the need of separate manifest and toc files? TOC is in a way metadata too.\n. ",
    "totanus": "Hi, I've been invited by Folletto to participate in this discussion because I had another one with him privately and we both think it could be better to go on publicly in this thread.\nI apologize if something I'll say has already been discussed. I tried to read all the posts but I jumped here and there hoping to get the whole sense of the discussion without spending all the day in it.\nHere's my cent.\nBaker is a framework dedicated to simplicity and I love it. \nIts current biggest limitation - if we may consider it so - is that hPub doesn't support a real multi-document/multi-level navigation. \nThe main reason is that it doesn't provide a set of rules for advanced T.O.C. creation (declarative or implicit). \nI'm not talking about the hypertextual capabilities of the documents, of course, but I refer to the capabilities provided by the specs, which rule also the capabilities of the framework (or other future readers based upon the format specs :) ) in parsing and understanding the inner structure of the hPub.\nIf I use hPub \"now\" I'm stuck with a linear 1-level navigation. \nIn my opinion hPub should offer rules and directives, supported by proper tools, with the aim to create an authoring environment based on progressive complexity, instead. \nSimple documents deserves simple structures, therefore light configuration is mandatory.\nAt the same time magazines and books seldom have a completely linear navigation system, or however I wouldn't bet that tomorrow they will behave in the same way they behave now. \nIn my opinion all that can be achieved in few simple steps:\n1) Introducing a manifest file with, at least, an URI protocol. The URI gives a proper ID to the publication for reference in-device and, maybe, on the web. \n2) Extending the alphabetical parsing to the subfolders (according to unicode mapping)\n3) If the manifest file contains a TOC this one overrides the alphabetical parsing (as Folletto wrote some days ago)\nSo, let the author take the decision between:\n- simple alphabetical sorting\n- advanced alphabetical sorting (with linking and subfolders)\n- custom navigation (with a dedicated TOC section in the manifest)\nThe real challenge, imho, is to build a specs document that allows to start with a linear navigation/structure but lets the author create complex multi-level and multi-document structures, connecting multiple, even encapsulates, different islands of content. \nhPub should be whole-comprehensive while Baker should be flexible in parsing hPub documents, discerning different levels of complexity in the documents as they are explained in the current (or missing) TOC section of the manifest file.\nThank you!\nTeo\n. Hi Folletto.\nPlease consider a magazine concept and a magazine workflow. \nA contributor works independently creating his own article structure (not necessarily a simple one), then he sends the directory to the editor. She just checks the content and then collects every directory and aggregates them in a single publication, adding just the needed html documents in the root.\nSomewhere in the publication there is a link to an article previously published. The app automatically checks (using the URI ID provided) if the article is present on the device. If not it asks for purchase or wish-list.\nThis scenario needs subfolder and link parsing to create an automated (and extensible) TOC and that could answer to your questions #1 and #2.\nAbout #3, almost every e-reader features a TOC interface (the base UI is a tree-view) and I think it could be useful both for the authors and the users. (edit: almost any serious paper book features a navigation map reflecting the author mental model of the document. ;) )\nIf you wish further details or scenarios I need some more time... :)\nHowever, yes, I think that those 3 levels may cover the 99,9% of cases and create the environment for new kinds of editorial interactions.\nThank you!\nTeo\n. @Bru, are you suggesting to use the index.html as manifest file, perhaps using a microformat html-based tagging to configure the publication's metadata?\nI couldn't agree more... It sounds absolutely fine to me. \n@Folletto: your example scenario does work. But I'm still concerned about manageability.\nHowever, let's pass over this. I think you got the point and made your decision about it.\nAbout the need for a TOC structure.\nI just want to make clear that I separate what the hPub definition is and what is the Baker implementation of the definition. \nWell, that said, I think that the hPub 'definition' should cover also a TOC generation section because there's no such a thing called \"document\" without a its own structure and when you delegate the structure definition to the file naming, well, its like building a city without planning (imho, of course). You can do that for small docs, but it's not convenient for books and magazines. \nFurthermore, TOC is not just a navigational tool to the reader, but it is also an outliner and a validator to the author. \nThen, Baker is still in charge to manage the TOC generation or parsing/visualization the way you want (ie: a visual drag&drop with html5 native features, for toc generation), or even completely ignore any implementation of the specs about that topic.\nIt's not for the sake of complexity, but it's just about a philological procedure.\nThat's it.\nHi, again!\nTeo\n. 1.   I agree with the \"just manifest\" option. My 2 Cents about HTML5 vs JSON: A good HTML5 semantic microformat can be easily human readable but, on the other side, JSON has more flexibility and is more AI-friendly. Both can be easily manipulated by a script. Actually, I can't say what could be the best solution. But here's my question: would you create an index.html just to put in there a snippet of javascript code, instead of creating a toc.js in the root dir? If you want to use index.html as manifest then HTML5 is more convenient. Otherwise I'd use a JSON syntax. What do you think?\n2.   Agreed.\n3.   Mmmh, I think that the Zhook approach works well because it's a single file document. With a distributed file environment it could be difficult to manage the whole picture. But this option is worth a try.\n. Simbul, I think it makes sense if you are using a microformat. \nMicroformats are human readable (if rendered through a browser) and can properly serve an application as manifest.\n. @Simbul, may we go in the nitty gritty even for just a minute, please, because I want to be sure I'm not missing some important points\nWhat kind of data should be inserted in what you call \"the manifest\"?\nI'm not sure they all are pure metadata, but I'm quite sure they could be of some interest (for reference, i.e.) for the author and the reader. I'm thinking about a single file that serves both as metadata provider and frontmatter/colophon/whatever.\n. @folletto, yes I think you are right. \nIn the end a developer could always manage the visualization of a TOC or of some of the metadata using just few lines of js code and parsing the json files. \nDC (an ISO standard) is a very good choice.\n. @bru: with subdirectories, I guess.\n.

    "nin9creative": "Anybody progress on this?\n. Has anyone seen this example?  http://www.siteless.org/?p=585\n. I emailed the guy that wrote the code to see if he wanted to join the conversation.  I actually haven't integrated the two yet but I poked around the code - pretty well done.  I also tweaked some of the look to mimic the Adobe Digital Publishing look and feel just for a test.  See a partially obscured version here.  http://public.nin9creative.com/baker/BakerShelf.png\n. I think the root issue here is how do we structure baker so that it can be invoked as the reader for a given hpub.  That way people can create different sorts of shelves or whatever to launch a specific downloaded book / issue.  I think that many of us are looking for some sort of Magazine / Issue shelf like many of the publishers using the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite of tools (which is insanely expensive for indie publishers).  \nThe Siteless magazine shelf above is the closest that I've seen and in my mind worth developing / working on further.  The issue is coming up with an easy way to launch Baker to view any given hpub...  @folletto has there been any work in taking the current Baker implementation and making it easy to integrate with shelf like apps?\n. @folletto thanks for the clarifications.  I'm excited about this.  As soon as Baker can be used as a viable alternative to some of the major software solutions for doing newsstand subscription type stuff, I think you'll see a huge uptick in people interested in baker and what it can do!  Very exciting.\n. Consolidating multiple posts that I had on another issue thread to this more appropriate thread\nSo I totally hacked this together to see if I could get it working. It's kind of messed up because I lost the Interceptor that catches the double taps and that sort of thing. Didn't look much into it - however I took the Siteless.org sample and combined the base code that they were using for the shelf with Baker. I got it working where I could download the issues from my server and open them in baker via the shelf view. It is totally hacky, but I was just trying to get the dumb thing to work! I think I almost pulled my hair out figuring this out.\nHere's a video of how it is working right now. I just am slapping a button on the webview of baker so that I can get back to the shelf - ugly yes :)\nhttp://public.nin9creative.com/baker/BakerShelfDemo/\nIf that prior link doesn't work this is a direct link to the quicktime file from screenium.\nhttp://public.nin9creative.com/baker/BakerShelfDemo/BakerShelfDemo-desktop.m4v\nIf you get the code from the \"bakershelf\" branch on my fork you can just run the sample. It will grab a list of issues from my webserver and also I've zipped up 5 versions of the default scarlet book with just a different title on the first book page so that you can see that it actually changes when you click on the covers. Not sure how this might play into a real shelf in Baker but I've been playing around and it looks promising. There is stuff missing such as a progress indicator on the actual content download, and a bunch of other stuff as well.\nI made a generic version here - this is what it looks like. I also need to change the .json to include a price etc for display, right now it's just hardcoded.\nhttp://public.nin9creative.com/baker/GenericBakerShelf.png\n. https://github.com/nin9creative/baker/tree/bakershelf\n.

All of the big guys using the Adobe Digital Publishing stuff (Oprah / Martha Stewart / etc).  \nThey seem to always land on the shelf if you are opening the app from the Newsstand interface.  Some (not all) also seem to update the Newsstand icon with the latest available issue cover art.\nHowever - opening the app always seems to land on the shelf view...\n. @folletto Can you take a look at Issue 2 https://github.com/nin9creative/baker/issues/2 on my fork / bakershelf branch?  Just a quick description.  With the shelf code out of the box, the Baker (RootViewController) is no longer what is first loaded.  I actually moved the baker code that was there to a (ReaderViewController) class.  In any event along the way the Interceptor window functionality was lost.  I can't figure out how to add that back in on top of the push of the ReaderViewController class since the Interceptor was designed to sit over the main window view.  This is holding up some of the progress that I and @mpena2099 are trying to make because the tap functionality isn't working correctly :)  I for the life of me am hitting a brick wall with this one.\nNot sure what you are working on or if you are doing something different for the shelf, but if you could help or if someone else that knows the Baker/Interceptor code well could take a quick look and see if it's an easy fix that would be great.\n. @pepereptio did you ever figure out your memory issues?

After changing that default setting in the actual Baker Framework code, I'm able to use the autoplay feature of the HTML5 audio tag and it works great.  Thanks for posting that!\nAndrew\n. Do you know when there might be a release with this integration (the full multi-book / shelf / newstand integration)?  I'm currently working on a single issue book/mag but it may have the potential to be a newstand subscription down the road.\n. @folletto I think as a framework you can only go so far.  I think that if Baker supported multiple issues to download/archive/redownload and a shelf view that launched open the downloaded issues that is about as far as you can go in a generic sense.  If someone is interested in using in app purchase and push notifications for background downloading and advanced stuff that would be on the shoulders of anyone developing that stuff for their apps to run with.\nI'd just be happy if we could get #2 done :)\nI forked Baker and have been trying to get a combined (siteless.org shelf) working with the current Baker release.  The problem is that Baker as it stands now isn't really suited for being invoked as a viewer for a given hpub (at least from a shelf point of view).\n. Sure!

I guess I'm asking will the out of the box samples for Laker work with the newest Baker code?  Or if I want to start a Laker project right now I still need to use their modified version of the Baker 2.0 framework?\nWas wondering if there was any in flight work to create a version of Laker that works on the 3.0 framework, or if the intention is that Baker is sucking in the changes that Laker has created?\nJust a little confused on the relationship of the two projects etc.\n:)  Although it seems that it doesn't take much to confuse me lately!\n. This went pretty well for me, however I did it before I saw this post :)\n. Has anyone noticed any \"stuttering\" type effects when swiping side to side or scrolling up and down with Baker 3 and Laker 1.1?  \nI can't really put a finger on why it's doing it.  I'm on an iPad2 and it just seems to not be very smooth.  It hangs for a few seconds every once and a while etc.  Curious to see if anyone else had noticed such behavior?\n.

I used Urban Airship for another app I did a while back.  The only problem is that you are locked into paying them if you are sending a lot of push notifications.  Will need to investigate setting this up.\n. I was just asking if anyone had thought about it as a potential issue...  I'm sure that some folks will invest a lot of time in creating content and features that they might not want easily \"borrowed\"...\n. I wouldn't go so far as to say that anyone is replicating the paranoia that exists in the music industry...  However Baker as a framework has great promise as a platform on iOS for publications.  Given some of the efforts on the Newsstand front, could provide a great option for organizations wanting a less costly solution than the Adobe and other solutions now available. I would also guess that one of the considerations would be deploying content that could not be easily replicated or borrowed...\nI think that it is a completely valid point to make.  If nobody cares then nobody cares.\n. This is different though.  The Adobe stuff mostly gets flattened out as images.  There isn't HTML, Javascript and CSS easily available.  Apparently I'm making an issue out of nothing.  I just thought I'd bring it up.  Feel free to ignore.\n. I guess in the grand scheme of things there are tradeoffs to be made...  I'd rather have a working shelf and in app purchase stuff going than worrying about people stealing my layouts :)\n. Cool.  Thanks for the the input @Simbul \n.

It would be cool if it could generate a view like the Adobe DPS view...\n\n. Does any of the book work?  Or just pages where you have the maps?\n. Hey Trashoid, so are you saying that it works when running in the bakershelf version, but it doesn't work when you use the standalone baker version?\n. Yeah, we had to change the code somewhat in the shelf to accomodate launching the Baker core as a \"plug in\" viewcontoller which included removing the interceptor window from the original Baker project and implementing a different gesture recognizer scheme....\n. On the Bakershelf-NewsstandKit branch yeah that works (default branch for my fork).\u00a0 There is a lot of stuff implemented, still trawling\nthrough the Newsstandkit stuff though, but there is a lot done already.\nYou can download the latest code from that branch and run it, it loads some sample issues etc so you can see the behavior.\n. You aren't going to share this?  On my Nexus 7 tablet it looks all screwed up (the interface).  Also, are you referencing the Issues list at my bakershelf.com domain?  It popped up asking what list to use and it was pre-populated with that.\nIt's too bad you aren't going to open source this to get some folks to contribute.

Rigth now we have to do it ourself depending of out personally needs.\nOne thing most people could use, and at standard magazine function, is the ability to mark pages as favourites with a star or someting. This should be combined with some sort of section where the favourites can be seen, sorted etc. If you put alle this in objectiveC and not HTML/javascript you have a iOS native functionality.\nYou can show a standard navigation bar at the top with the required buttons to mark as favourite and to show the list. The navigation bar can show up along with the index.html file when you tap a page.\nAnother posibility is to build in support for in app purchase and newsstand support.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. For the new issues being released there is a .json file that you host on your own website that determines what your app will load in the shelf.  For full newsstand support there is a way to implement push notifications with background downloading for the app.  I don't think the shelf branch supports that right now - and I don't know if it's in scope for the 4.0 milestone or not.\n. What about starting off with something that pops open a window (minus the bundled book suggestions above etc?)  Perhaps even just a XIB file that someone can easily edit and that is static with the binary?\n. I guess the question is how do you make it flexible enough to work for both iPad and iPhone.  If it were just iPad, it'd be easy to use a popover from the nav bar.\n. The simplest thing that I have now is just a little settings / gear icon that pops open a Alert View that can at least display some copyright or other information in a simple popup alert.\n. lol \nOn Nov 22, 2012, at 3:43 PM, Davide Casali notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nPersonally, I would avoid implementing that: too minimal to be useful. :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Do you guys want me to put in a pull request for this?  Or does it not look like a good idea?  I thought it was a good compromise, allowing the user a canvas (the XIB) file for iPad and iPhone to create some sort of static screen that will pop up (the same way on iPad and iPhone) when clicking on the info icon on the top right of the shelf.\n\nLet me know if you think it will work or not.  Personally, I think that I will go this route for my own app as it's pretty simple and works.\n. I got this working for all versions of iPad / iPhone (retina non retina) / iPhone 5.\nThere is an icon on the top right hand corner of the shelf menu bar (info icon).\n1)  User taps it, and a modal window animates in from the bottom.\n     a)  On iPad it is presented as a modal Form Sheet (smaller than whole screen and dims the edges)\n     b)  On iPhone it's a whole view (iPhone doesn't support Form Sheets)\n2)  There are a few XIB files that a user can customize for display.  Each has a Portrait and Landscape view (needed\n     for iPhone).  The shelf determines which to display depending on the device and uses the TPMultiLayoutViewController (another Github class) to handle the correct display / rotation of the modal views.\nIt's pretty simple and allows a developer flexibility in what they want to put on their shelf info page.\nI think this is a good first step towards implementing this feature.\nLet me know if you want me to push it for you guys to review and think about pulling in to the master.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Hmm, will need to look into that.  Ideally I would like to find a decent host with a large bandwidth allowance for files.  I'm not sure, but I have a feeling that a lot of folks will run into a similar issue if they start publishing heavy media laden magazines with the BakerShelf.  I'll try to do some more research.\n.

Ok, so I talked to a few different people...  It seems that some are trying to use hosts that have \"unlimited\" bandwidth as part of their offering.  Hostgator, Bluehost etc...  However I think it's a fine line before those types of hosts might catch on to the potential high bandwidth issues (with bundled video etc) that might occur.\nSomeone else turned me on to 100TB.com hosting accounts.  On the higher end they offer dedicated servers at a somewhat reasonable cost (if you are actually making money on the magazines or hosting them for someone you can charge).  I spec'ed out a pretty nice server that includes 100TB of premium bandwidth for about $250 per month. \nThe nice thing is that they also have a shared server hosting plan (which is all you'd need for hosting issues and newsstand content) that starts off at $20 / node per month.  Each node gives you 10GB of disk space and 1TB of bandwidth.  You can also adjust that up over time by adding nodes if you require it for your app.\nhttps://www.100tb.com/cloud-servers/\nI think that for me I will try using something like Hostgator and see if I run into any issues.  If I do, I'll switch to 100TB.com with their cloud based offering at the lowest end and go from there.\nSounds like a plan for me at least :)\nFYI - I have no affiliation whatsoever with any of these.  Just thought I'd pass along what I dug up.\n. Scratch the Hostgator idea.  Hosting files for serving up to an iPad is against their Terms of Service (chatted with a customer service rep).  Also, their download speeds are SLOW.  I tried downloading a 150mb hpub and was only getting around 100kbs.  Not very fast at all.\n. I did a little more digging on this.  I believe that this line is the culprit.  I have made some changes to add another cover url to the JSON file on my fork in case someone wanted to have a different cover for the retina version vs the non retina version.  But commenting out this line fixes the issue of the retina version being messed up.  It looks super sharp on my iPad 3.\nUnder the Setup Cover Image in IssueViewController.m\nissueCover.layer.shouldRasterize = YES;\n\n. I'm trying to test a few different scenarios...  Not sure why it was there in the first place?  There must have been a reason?\n. Ah, I got it.  Did some more research.  I guess since you guys were adding a layer to the issueCover image to add the shadow, you were rasterizing the image to probably speed up things.  It looks like otherwise the processor would have to do some more work to keep up with the shadow if orientation changed / items were in a scroll list or whatnot.\nHowever adding another bit of code right after the shouldRasterize option fixes the problem as well....\nissueCover.layer.shouldRasterize = YES;\n    issueCover.layer.rasterizationScale = [UIScreen mainScreen].scale;\n. One thing I haven't tested is whether or not just using one cover image would work in all cases.  For example, just setting the cover image to a larger retina sized image - would that work ok on non retina screens.  I'll have to test that.  If it doesn't, I've already done some coding to allow for both a retina and non retina version of the cover to be specified by the issue list.  On the cover download, the device determines which version to pull based on a test if it's a retina device or not.\n. Well, it looks like if you just upload a retina version of the image as the Cover, it works ok on a non retina device, and it works on the retina device.\nThe simplest fix for this whole issue then would be to create some documentation around what sizes a developer should use if they want to also support retina devices and then let the device scale the image down as needed.\nUnless there would ever be a need to support two different versions of the cover (the published wanted something different to show up for retina vs non retina) then the addition of the rasterizationScale line of code would work.\n. Sounds good.\n. I submitted a pull request for this change.\n\n. Actually I just noticed that I should probably have put the UIAlertView interface definition in the .h file in a ifdef for the newsstand flag.  If you pull this in you may want to quickly just add that.\n. I added the info / about view that was discussed in Issues #525\n. Ha, oops...  My mistake :)  I will close this one and do separate pull requests.\n. Hope I got this correct this time!\n.

    "therabidbanana": "I'm planning on adding multiple hpub support to my Baker fork for a project I'm working on. Is there any planned movement on this from the Baker team, or planned updates to the hpub specification that might be of interest (the recent addition of a JSON library by @folletto seems to hint at moving toward JSON manifests)? If there are plans to support metadata in manifests that could be quite useful.\nHere's what I'm thinking of building: \nKeep every hpub downloaded, and the associated book:// url, with a dictionary mapping url to hpub. On a book:// url, check to see if it's already been downloaded by looking it up in the dictionary. If so, just unzip the local hpub, else download as normal. \nFor some people, that might be enough, but for flexibility I imagine I will also need to add the following capabilities: \n- Showing the user a list of hpubs already downloaded.\n- Allow deleting existing local hpubs\n- Allow updating local hpubs (transparently delete and then redownload if versions don't match).\nI see two possible ways to handle the extra use cases:\n1. (Use Javascript/HTML as much as possible) Inject the dictionary of local hpubs into the page as a javascript variable. Either inject into every single page, or maybe only book://local pages, or maybe only a specific file defined in the application (index.html might be a good place). Add support for book://local/path/delete so that books can be deleted. Let users define whatever javascript they'd like to take the local hpub list and work with it. The injection of javascript variables seems kind of hackish, but would allow a lot of customization with just standard html/js.\n2. (Obj-C all the way) Create a new UIView accessible either by a new url like book://shelf, or maybe in place of book://local if preferred - maybe build on top of something like https://github.com/AlanQuatermain/AQGridView to give a pretty interface. This option seems less hackish, but is also a lot less flexible.\nAnyone have any thoughts on which version they'd prefer, or things I might not have considered?\n. I had considered adding a navigation bar, but thought it could get kind of cluttered showing even more on double tap, and I wasn't sure how minimalist you were hoping to keep the interface. As long as it's easy to disable, I suppose that's not an issue though.\nI like the way the dropdown works in Dropbox (http://c0736882.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/Dropbox%20iPad%20-%203.png). Something similar to that may be appropriate, but I have no idea how hard it is to program.\nOne thing I hadn't really considered - it sounds like you're imagining being able to see books in the list that haven't been downloaded yet. How do you imagine letting the application know those books exist - hardcoding the list into the app? Maybe some sort of JSON list or RSS feed pulled off of a server? My original thought was just having the local book be a simple, one-page hardcoded list of book:// urls and releasing an app update every time the list of books (or in our case, magazine issues) changed. That's probably not very scalable though. It might be better if there was a list the application could retrieve from the server - but then we'd need to work out a standardized format to use for listing books - maybe just a JSON array of manifests?\n. I have a beginning implementation working in https://github.com/orangesparkleball/baker/tree/multiple-hpubs.\nA navigation bar shows up on double tap with a popover for displaying the list of stored books. The implementation is still a little crude - each hpub must have a unique filename, and updates are not download if the filename is the same. There's also not any way to delete books yet.\n. Was just about to post an update on this front. :)\n- Do you mean putting this button on the left instead of the right? I was thinking we might also add a \"Close book\" arrow and place it on the left.\n- This is now pulled from the manifest (if one exists).\n- A bit trickier - since currently manifests are zipped inside the hpub, brings up a question below.\n- I was having trouble trying to get them to come in together in a way that didn't look haphazard. I'll play with it a bit more.\nQuestion - does it make more sense to keep the hpubs, or the extracted versions of the hpubs? Theoretically the hpubs will take less space, but I can't imagine it's a significant enough amount to worry about. On the flipside, keeping the hpubs makes them easier to treat as discrete books so you can move books into Baker with the iTunes File Sharing system. \nIf we keep them around as hpubs, it's probably worth caching any manifests into a database so the system doesn't need to extract the hpub to find the manifest - although I think the zip library might have support for peeking into the zip file without extracting. Maybe that's an option. Will need to investigate.\n. The dropdown can now peek into the hpub and look for a manifest. If it finds one, it replaces the filename with the title from that manifest, otherwise it just uses filename. With this method we don't necessarily have to store manifests separately. \nI think we still might want to store manifests separately - that'd allow you to delete a book but keep a reference to it so you could easily redownload it... but I imagine peeking into an hpub to find the manifest could still be useful if you downloaded a book but didn't open it (going back to the iTunes file sharing method of adding books), so it's a good first step.\n. Is it worth forking this effort off into its own \"baker reader\" project? Our requirements for this project have evolved to create a \"like iBooks\" reader, complete with a shelf and the ability to download multiple books. I've got some of this going in my multiple-hpubs branch, but I'm restructuring so much of the code it's starting to look like a completely different program and it's not making sense to even support a single bundled book any more. \nMy end goal is to release to the App Store a \"Baker Reader\" program that is basically an iBooks clone with hpub support instead of epub. Then, rather than having to build a new app for each of our clients, we can have them download that and then send them the hpub via email or book:// url. I get the reasoning behind creating per-book apps - so each one can have its own unique look and feel, and be a separate app in the  app store. So I can see wanting to have both a \"Baker Core\" that works as Baker does now, and a \"Baker Reader\" that pulls in elements of the Baker core while adding more of the iBooks like functionality. \n. Whoops, I did a lot of restructuring and didn't push all of my changes. Just pushed another commit or two that should remove any last references to the NavBarController.h.\nAs of yet, nothing I've done specifically breaks Baker, though some of the changes might be hard to merge (I split out some new classes to help cut down on the code in the RootViewController). \nI just wonder if the changes I plan on building (no bundled book, a shelf view for viewing hpubs, the navigation bar and book:// url support) are getting to the point where they warrant splitting the project between a \"Baker Core\" and a \"Baker Reader\", where the reader duplicates the Core classes to handle viewing books, but also adds in a Shelf view and hpub handling support, etc - stuff that wouldn't make sense for people building a simple, single-book app. \nI don't know if it'd make sense to keep adding constants to turn on and off extra features, which is probably what we'd need to do if they were both contained within the same repo (and include two different plists for building the app depending on if you want Reader or Standard - since url schemes have to be added with the plist, etc). I suppose they could be separate branches, but if they are maintained as two separate branches then that's not really any different from forking the project.\n. In my mind, one of the key features is a reader that does have book:// turned on at the OS level so that I don't have to distribute apps via testflight every time I want people to be able to preview a new book (so far we're building these books as internal enterprise apps, not general public apps). Being able to email book:// links to distribute new copies is ideal (or include email attachments). We want to build several books and know our clients can view them without going through  the hassle of getting us  their device ids and without having to deploy to the app store, since the books would be private. \nI suppose if people are fine with a shelf view for their single-book apps that's fine, though the shelf viewing support might be adding a decent amount of code to the project (unsure if it'd significantly impact performance to have the code there and just ignore it - but it seems silly to force users to have the shelf if they don't plan on using it). \nI should note that I plan on adding support for multiple \"shelves\" of content, where each magazine/collection would have its own shelf within the reader and be able to notify the reader when there is a new book within the shelf (maybe each shelf is an RSS feed of links to hpubs or something like that?), on top of the ability to manually add books to a shelf. So in my mind the shelf isn't just a tiny bit of extra code, it's going to add a lot of extra functionality that just doesn't make sense for single-book apps.\nOur end goal is to provide our clients with a CMS (based on the bakers-oven idea I've been toying with) for creating new hpubs (or updating existing ones) and distributing those hpubs to a set of users in the quickest and easiest way possible. \n. Okay, I wasn't sure if the plan was to include support for the shelf in the Baker Core. I definitely plan on getting a single shelf working before trying to work on the multiple shelves idea, hopefully it'll be ready within the next week or two.\n. Hey @ravitola, no real progress since my last comment in June, unfortunately. I've been a bit sidetracked lately. You can check out the work so far in my topic branch: https://github.com/orangesparkleball/baker/tree/multiple-hpubs\nStill to be done:\n- Fix the index view so that it isn't pushed down by the navigation bar\n- Create a better interface for the list of hpubs\nWhat's been done so far:\n- A large amount of refactoring to create \"book\" and \"shelf\" models and separate view controllers responsible for different parts fo the app\n- Enabling of book:// url catching from external apps\n- Enabling file-type recognition so you can \"Open With...\" the file from other applications such as Mail and Dropbox\n- Enabling file synchronization in iTunes so you can add hpubs with iTunes\n. Well, I wanted to build support for catching the URL scheme, even if it does get turned off by default, so in my testing branch it's on. To turn it off is an easy plist change though. \n. Hey everyone, just thought I'd give a quick update since I got a message in my Github inbox today:\nI've stopped working on this and I'm not sure when I'll have the chance to get back to it any time soon. I recently switched jobs, so haven't been able to make changes during my work hours any more. If anyone wants to take the lead on this, feel free to take a look at what I've done so far in my branch and either build off of it or start fresh (I did a pretty intensive code refactoring, so it'll probably be nearly impossible to merge into the latest code). \nI'll probably loop back to this at some point when I have a bit more free time, but I definitely won't have any time in the next few months to work on it, and if it's done by then I'll just find something else in Baker to fix. :D\n. @mimetic: is this with the SCROLLVIEW_BGCOLOR set to black? That might help if you haven't set it yet.\nOne issue I'm seeing with the three-card branch in my testing - orientation changes that were already sort of slow have become unbearably slow, since now I have to wait for three separate pages to reflow to the orientation. Maybe it'd be possible to free up the previous and next cards before orientation change, then start reloading them after the orientation change has occurred? I suppose I also need to make some changes to my book to help speed up those orientation changes. \n. Well, my problem is that the orientation change doesn't actually show on screen until all of those pages are ready to rotate. So I'm waiting as much as 5 seconds for a rotation of the device to actually translate to a rotation of content. If those extra webviews were destroyed before rotation, the rotation could occur quicker - then, when it's less noticeable, slow down the device to load those extra pages.\n. Another thing I'm noticing in my testing is that if a page has started fading in right as you swipe to the next page, it can get a little choppy trying to animate the swipe and the fade in at once.\n. Another thing that might help performance (haven't played with it) - is to not start loading slots -1 and +1 until slot 0 has fully loaded. I'm noticing when I jump to a page from a link, page loads are slower than they are without the three-card setup and the log is showing all three pages starting to be requested at the same time, which is probably contributing to that. \n. Thanks for your work as well @Xm4s! When used as intended (slowly paging through) the three card approach is looking great for our book. I'm just doing as much as I can to break it so we can work out the rough patches :D\n. I had a random thought the other day - would it be possible to save screenshots of each rendered page and show those while  the actual webview is loading behind it? I don't know if that'd give any sort of performance hit, but it might give the appearance that the pages are loading faster than they really are.\n. Yeah, it's definitely something that'd have to happen on the fly - and saving those images would possibly cause a performance hit (though maybe, if you wanted as a developer, we could make it so you can pull those images back off the device/simulator and save them inside the book). \nI would guess that to have the full benefit, we'd need to save full-height screenshots so that they could be scrolled (though obviously you'd not be able to click links or interact with javascript elements). I think you could still show a loading icon over a slightly blurred/grayed out screenshot - since I think the main benefit is being able to see what the page will be before it finishes loading - especially when you're flipping through pages to try to find a specific one, rather than instant interactivity (though both would obviously be better :D). \n. Maybe I'll play around with it a bit after I've got basic multiple hpub support working. You're right, seems like it'll probably have a pretty low cost-benefit ratio. \nI was just playing with some of the big publisher magazines like Wired and saw how fast they can load pages and was trying to figure out if there was a way we could pull that level of interactivity off - my guess was they probably just have flat images of pages, which are much cheaper memory-wise to render. As it stands, that's probably the last thing to worry about though.\n. I'm thinking a good start for supporting multiple hpubs will be breaking out as much functionality as possible into \"Book\" and \"Shelf\" models, and moving things like extraction of downloads, manifest loading, page number counts and other stuff like that into those models. \nCan you think of any issues with this plan? Does it conflict with refactoring you're already doing?\n. Some initial refactoring pushed up to my fork: https://github.com/orangesparkleball/baker/tree/data-models\n. Hey guys, I've broken out Florian's awesome navigation bar enhancement from Laker into a separate topic branch that can be merged into the Baker core - Issue #85 has the changes.\nI made some modifications to allow disabling the feature completely by setting a constant, updating the navigation when opening a downloaded .hpub, and handle resizing a little better. \n. Also based on Florian's work - a Sinatra based hpub generator.\nhttps://github.com/orangesparkleball/bakers-oven\n. That's certainly a more elegant solution than what I went with - I hid the navigation in a subfolder so that it'd be hidden, but obviously a change in the hpub specification would be a much more straightforward solution (all my nav items have to link with a \"../\" in front of them).  Look forward to seeing those changes. \nThis pull request is mainly to go along with another project I'm releasing shortly to allow building a book as a Sinatra app, with a rake task to package up the latest version into an .hpub for easy downloading (so I can use my favorite ruby libraries - HAML and SASS). Thanks for the heads up on the addition of index.html to the hpub specification. \n. No worries - it's been a while since I did any ObjC, was good to get some practice. Look forward to seeing the implementation you guys are working on.\n. The rotation issue actually looks like it originates from Baker's core - every now and then the resetScrollView function gets called before pageHeight and pageWidth are set to the correct values for the orientation, resulting in a landscape frame for portrait mode and a portrait frame for landscape mode. To get it to happen I had to keep rotating back and forth a lot. Hard to reproduce in a predictable manner, but since it's not directly related to the navigation bar I can open it as a separate issue. Fix for 1 in the pull request queue shortly.\n. Hmm... not sure why github is trying to force you to recommit all of your commits. I'll see about creating a separate branch with those two commits cherry picked.\n. I have encountered this issue as well - it seems to occur most frequently on pages with lots of content to resize (we use a lot of @media queries to handle rotation - and those a slow). It looks like @selector(setPageSize:) is getting called too early on occasion - setting the boundaries of  the screen to portrait boundaries when you've just rotated to landscape (and vice versa). \n. I think I found and fixed the issue. I'm submitting a patch, but you can try the fix immediately by changing [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] to [self interfaceOrientation] in RootViewController.m on two lines.\norangesparkleball/baker@05377c2d92aa93911b912fb391b2f083d9029f6c\n. Are you using javascript to handle orientation change resizing? I'm using CSS media queries, which the patch seems to fix for my test cases, but javascript events get called earlier and might still be getting the wrong size. \n. Hmm... do you have a test hpub/book directory you can share? I'd be willing to take a look.\n. Well, I don't mind the idea of linking directly to other sites if they do post the content, but generally I'm more likely to post to a project wiki than post directly on my own site because I know other people can come along and help clean it up and keep it up to date - I don't know if others are the same way.\n. We've been using testflightapp to distribute our internal books - I highly recommend it. You still have to go to Apple's provisioning center and add devices individually to your \"distribution certificate\", which is pretty complicated if you've never done something like that before (I spent several hours fighting with the code signing nonsense before I got my app deployed on somebody else's iPad)\n.

    "viggiosoft": "Hi,\nI'm the person that prepared the articles about magazine in http://ios-blog.co.uk and http://www.viggiosoft.com . I have been contacted to follow this project (I didn't know it before, excellent work by the way, congratulations!) and provide my cooperation in this discussion. \nIt seems to me that everybody agrees on the need to extend the framework by adding the front-end (shelf) and back-end (client/server communication, Newsstand, In App Purcahse). While there is no a clear direction if these implementations should be added in the current framework as it or as new frameworks. \nI have prepared several apps, and on of my great early choices was to implement a reusable PDF reader (with all possible options: search, links, multimedia, ...) in order to be able on each app to re-use 80% of the reader (customer will require a customization) and the need to build just the shelf (front-end). Later I found that having 3 parts is better than two: the reader, the front-end shelf (UI), the back-end. In most cases the customer will ask you to rebuild from scratch the UI, while the back-end is highly reusable in different apps and different devices. \nSo my opinion in such case is to avoid extending the existing framework, excellent as a reader, by adding back-end features and UI views. My suggestion is to provide other two modules that will link with the reader and will provide some guidelines for custom implementations. E.g. the back-end will change its implementation based on the kind of server it needs to work with or on the protections applied to provide In App Purchase, but the download and installation of the content will be done in the same way as this is established by the reader format. Besides the front-end will contain the basic hooks or protocols to both the reader (\"open this book\") or to the back-end (\"purchase this book\", \"download this book\") but it will be up to the final developer customize this part of the app.\nAnyway I would be happy to provide my contribution based on the directions that the owner of this project will give to me.\nCarlo\n. Hi,\nI'm the person that prepared the articles about magazine in http://ios-blog.co.uk and http://www.viggiosoft.com . I have been contacted to follow this project (I didn't know it before, excellent work by the way, congratulations!) and provide my cooperation in this discussion. \nIt seems to me that everybody agrees on the need to extend the framework by adding the front-end (shelf) and back-end (client/server communication, Newsstand, In App Purcahse). While there is no a clear direction if these implementations should be added in the current framework as it or as new frameworks. \nI have prepared several apps, and on of my great early choices was to implement a reusable PDF reader (with all possible options: search, links, multimedia, ...) in order to be able on each app to re-use 80% of the reader (customer will require a customization) and the need to build just the shelf (front-end). Later I found that having 3 parts is better than two: the reader, the front-end shelf (UI), the back-end. In most cases the customer will ask you to rebuild from scratch the UI, while the back-end is highly reusable in different apps and different devices. \nSo my opinion in such case is to avoid extending the existing framework, excellent as a reader, by adding back-end features and UI views. My suggestion is to provide other two modules that will link with the reader and will provide some guidelines for custom implementations. E.g. the back-end will change its implementation based on the kind of server it needs to work with or on the protections applied to provide In App Purchase, but the download and installation of the content will be done in the same way as this is established by the reader format.

Hi Davide,\nthanks for your suggestion. Definitely forking 3.1 and trying to refactor it in such way that it can talk with an external shelf using a general purpose interface is a great idea. I will try to experiment a little bit privately in order to have a deep understanding of the code sections I need to interact with and if I get some valid result I will  be happy to publish and explain my comments.\nThank you\n. Hi Mauricio,\ncan you share your work as a fork on GH? I will try to have a look and see how can I help you on point [4]. Honestly I had no time to look at the whole stuff, all my customers are pushing me to see all they apps released by Christmas and I'm really busy... But as you already merged the shelf with baker in a single project, this can simplify my job.\nCarlo\nSent from my iPad\nOn 03/dic/2011, at 02:26, mpena2099 reply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nHi!\nThat's what I'm trying to do to pub Baker on \"Carlo's Shelf\":\n1. change the file links to download store.plist HPub COMPRESSED files;\n   (DONE!)\n2. download OK, unzip the file using the class decompressing already exists in Baker;\n   (DONE!)\n3.

Hi Mauricio, I just opened an issue about some missing files in your fork'd project. I would keep all issues and communications related to that experiment on the new bakershelf git so people interested can follow it in the right place.\n. @nin9creative It seems this example is what we're looking for. I checked-out its pugpig integration and it works very well. The code is quite clear and it seems they're working in integrating Baker.\n. \n",
    "mutador": "mi comments about the look & fell of the version off nin9creative\nmy vision is like a fashion magazine ....\n1- the first page , always a generic cover, whit alpha animation e.g\n2-the look and fell mut be customizable for the user in html, embed a html not code in xcode ( in general let the user personalice his own page)\n3- if the embed html is not posible, not use the look and fell of the sencha touch aplications, is too much tecnic and not fashion, the top and the footer whitout background ( background: none; ) and let the user to put an image like background. the  idea is make transparent buttoms and a .png fot the look&fell\n. sorry, but i am designer whit very basic know of html, we are looking for someone in spain  for developer xcode framework like baker and not found nobody, we only help in desing and contributions \nbut understand  of the idea of the background image for the page, is a god idea to customize the top and background\n. but i only say, dont use background in xcode for the top and the bottom and use a background image for the page ( 1024x768) , off course all the text of the title, price and xml in xcode.... you know where i mean\n\nof course this is not a priority...\n. all the issues are integrated and upload in the newsstand, and there are a way ( but we don\u00b4nt found) to linkage this upload issues whit the visor...whitout a extrenal hosting .( bye bye adobe solution.. for hsoting)\nthis is for pdf\nhttp://www.viggiosoft.com/blog/blog/2011/10/17/ios-newsstand-tutorial/\nand this make the solution , but they host your magazines, and we think is not necesary if you know the link of the issue tha you upload by newsstand. \nhttp://urbanairship.com/\n. but i see you use a very old baker in this case laker framework, it will be a problem integrate a old version of baker o this is only for hpub and the books can use the last version?\nalways the books must be the last version and the visor a independent code\n.

I must be very short but I do not understand, in the email you send , you say that baker has a Newsstand basic support, but the reality is you can not post a magazine make with baker in the  Newstand , that asks you to programming  expecific fot it  whit a visor, a free or pay suscription, etc...\nactually can not have a magazine  in the Newstand whit baker, or yes?, if it\u00b4s possible put it on the newsstand and someone made it, could explain how?\nthanks\n. sorry folletto but you say there are examples of baker in the appstore in newsstand? can you show me one?\n. if the only thing u have done is add to the plist the line 'Application presents content in Newsstand=YES', apple will reject your app because don't have the way to manage subcriptions. I did it before, and apple reject my app.\n. thanks @tstegart , and thanks @folletto.\nthe really for the moment  is we can not put a baker magazine in newsstand.\ni\u00b4m going to open a issue to talk about profesional editorial and magazine whit baker, problems, future...., we are in spain and we like to colaborate with other people whit a professional project if this is about fashion, photo, arts...\nI think baker , with their simple book currently working with does not have the same problems and needs with a large magazine\n. hi tstegart\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/20#issuecomment-3237216\n. https://github.com/DeenNa/SimpleNewsstand\n. no really, i only think its good to see how it works....its for pdf\u00b4s whit a external download\n. the ipad version yes, is adobe digital publishing\nthe iphone/ipod version is baker/laker\n. try to explain whit the help of google translator\nbaker is a great solution But it's not valid for profesional digital publishing.\nthe user experince is not right. it need to load the entire magazine at once.\nadobe at the moment is the best solution in my opinion but it is too expensive and other bad thigs about big companys...\nI've been looking at other solutions like pugpig and honestly I'll sacrifice speed and versatility in front of a full load of the magazine as soon as some improvements in the framework pugpig.\nCould you explain more in detail my reasons.\nanother thing is that I very much hope that you succeed on a full charge at some point, it is essential, if you had with an html templates system you could have a very competitive solution compared to adobe Aquafadas,etc\nclear that perhaps your goals are different.\nso if it is that I am very grateful for the work they have done and share it, i hope you try the baker efforts to improve and evolve for a full load experience.\ni would like to talk about this things and colaborate, but my english is very poor and i only a designer and user experience skills.\nregards\n. same as tablazines.....\n. hi\nany date for 3.0? or the new especifictions?\nthanks\n. this happens if you use a complex js\nfor some reason this version is very sensitive to complex js and css, appearing this bug and white flash betwenn changes pages.\nI have a stable css page for general and do not touch it, if the new  page its complex i created a new css fot it.\neven if the CSS does not give errors may be things you do not like the compiler or safari ?\n. http://www.omgod.es/app/\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ohmygod00/id472971950?l=es&ls=1&mt=8\n.  blameto  the baker ... Joking, I think it's a memory problem, I've downloaded again and I do well, but my iphone1 is 64gb  , the magazine that we are following up we had to make with the system \" three cards \" that could not stand the i weight to crash all the time, I guess it's a problem of how to manage memory the ipad and what I read in other post baker people know this but it should be easy to fix ....\nI hope the system will solve all three cards.\na question? spoils you forever in the same place? closes the app ? remains hookup?\n. i have the same problem but more without three cards...if you use baker whit a lot a .jpg in a same html and when you use div hidden for landscape or portrait....crash.....\n. i have one\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ohmygod00/id472971950?l=es&ls=1&mt=8\nwhit the same problem\nand now all change , i try to upload an new , and apple says me baker must be a diferent folder than documents, but i am waiting for review , when i finished it i\u00b4ll put a post about this new especification.\nthey use folder library/cache\nthe problem is in the memory of the ipad, if the book is too big it will crash\n. i know, i only say thanks for your work.\ni can send my folder book because they have a lot of images whit copyright, but you only make a book whit a lot of big images and html, video and js and see the problem\n. baker for big magazines only is right in threecards mode, in screenshot crash....\nbut i think this is a problemen for all the people whit html5 similar frameworks....for this a lot of people make the magazines only in one orientation....\nbut i agree whit you \" The html page baker book use for testing are no real-life pages.\"....pleased use this kind of book for testing\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ohmygod-es-02/id499892763?l=es&ls=1&mt=8\n. https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/301\ni dont send nothing about this post, you can get it all the books you want...\ndon\u00b4nt offended....we love your work , for me is very very apreciated\n. but is my book.... if you want i send you by wetransfer\n. ia a memory problem, and it\u00b4s depends no crash for a concret page...all the books i made crash when you rotate...but no allways in one page....whe you rotate , alleatory crash.....\ni think is a problem of the memeroy because en three cards mode don\u00b4t crash\n. If this is so, it would be good to include in the default option\nbook.json\nsomething like\n\"-baker-rendering-ipad1\": \"three-cards\",\n  \"-baker-rendering-ipad2\": \"three-cards\",\nmore flexible than change the framework xcode\n. my experience\nlakers doesn\u00b4t work fine whit baker now, i\u00b4ts a problem of the scripts, the include of the html is the most bad. i decided no use because this....you can try to delete the js and tell us your new experience abut it ( can my english be more bad, i say yes....)\n. i have this errors when i rotate ipad\n\nint retVal = UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, @\"UIApplication\", @\"BakerAppDelegate\");\n--Thread 1: Program received signal: \"SIGABRT\".\n\n// Portrait\n    view.image = backgroundImagePortrait;\n} else {\n    view.image = NULL;\n}\n}\nThread 1: program recceived signal: \" EXC_BAD_ACCESS\".\n. but be carefull whit the screenshot mode, it give you the same error whit a big book whit a lot images....\n. you try includes? see laker\n. but in three cards is not when \"bakerloaded\" is when \"bakershowpage\" the pages after and before is load when don\u00b4t show, yo need the animation star when the page is show or when the user stop in the page\n. GREAT- works fine ( ipad 1 - threcards mode)\n. we have the same problem, and change it, it\u00b4s for iCloud, \nwe change in RootViewController.m\n// ** BOOK DIRECTORIES\n        // *** MUTADOR CODE para cambio del directorio a Cache NSCachesDirectory\n        //NSString documentsPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0];\n        NSString documentsPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSCachesDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0];\n. my feedback is newstand, jajajajajaja ...yes i know....best regards @Xm4s.\n. My first comment is the comment and support for newsstand, which is necessary and essential for the viability of professional projects.\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/100#issuecomment-3223583\nThere are several requirements related to the inclusion of advertising such as eg\ninclude a form of floating windows open baker himself with urls possib online and have a close button, without leaving the baker, but can easily return to baker\n. You work for a viewer with direct downloads.\nI believe(  and be wrong) than the correct way  for magazines professionals and clients  is only newsstand ,they  are going to demand their systems newsstand and subscriptions and payments  through apple system.\neven your  viewer must be inside the newsstand , that is where people now search for magazines only in newsstand.\nis my opinion\nWe can help with design issues and beta testers only, we are not developers...\n. hi  mpena2009, \nbut you are to put a magazine in newsstand? they have their own especifications , your work whit direct downloads probably does\u00b4nt be for nothing whit newsstand, but i comment how i see the aplication whit direct downloads....\n. ok i hope this, i comment in this https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/20 how i see the project now\n. idea: a rss system integrate in xcode baker, not in html5 , similar \"http://flipboard.com/\"\n. Well, it is always well received by advertisers, which has a page that is updated real-time content, you tell them in the magazine may have an ad that changes by the day they go crazy.\nThis would be so and it's one thing I miss much at fault: iframes with content that is updated online if you are connected and it will show the latest version loaded, and xml or rss. but always have content, e.g. whit the date of the update\nanoter great idea is this: http://vimeo.com/27296518\n. thanks @folleto \nbut I say, it\u00b4s need implementation in baker, because you need is a page to save the update via xml and display it with the date in baker upadate,  if the user updates it and if not,  showing the latest updated content and keep in a final update. if you just use javascript in the html does not work (or if someone may hideout in iphone javascript content please share it), i am not sure to explained well\nthis is a thing have adobedigitalpublishing and a lot of similar solutions for magazines\n. but i only talk in a part of one page, not a full hpub, i am gona make a sreenshoot\n\n. Thanks for your references, but we have tried this , your point 1 and in practice does not work well with apps and pages in html and manifest files only, we found that at times for visualizing changes need to delete the preferences and manually Cache sometimes even delete and reinstall the app. So this makes it unfeasible to do so and still think that the solution passes through xcode integration.\nwe have interview whit xcode developer in madrid but nobody seems to know how to do what we ask, integration with newsstand, xml and rss....etc ...... we are searching for a xcode developer in madrid  to customice baker , newsstand integration etc...\n. i use a jquery solution for external url into baker...if no internet conection show a page saying \"no internet conection avaliable\" if yes , load the external page but whit a button for come back the baker page, the button is  always visible..\nsee jquery moblie examples for load pages whit buttoms\nhttp://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html\ni am waiting for review my new app whit this solution, when the app is ready for sale , i linked the download url\n. i hate this , because it happens too in images as buttoms etc....\nsomeone knows how to desactivated this?\n. i have this problem in some pages, when tap dont go the next/previos page and doble tap go to next, next page...two pages...\niuse ipad 1, threecards and ios 5\nyou can test it in my new book, you\u00b4ll know how you get?....\n. http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/\n. but now? it\u00b4s only for education, what happend whit magazines?\ni testetd, and it\u00b4s not viable for magazines,long life baker...but whit newsstand integration, pleased...\n. we try, but spain is not the place, we talk whit @mpena2099  and friend , and we waiting for ....\n. but you have used the ebook author? is oriented to chapters and sections, has no sailing magazine, is only vertical and horizontal in a case in another ...\ntext content is the same in horizontal and vertical ...\nit\u00b4s invalid for magazines.\nanother question is the format epub3, etc...\n. but dont forget is version 1.1\nthey will update whit new interactions and better expecifications soon....\n. about this\n\"I don't know if it's work or not, it's just increase the hidden time to avoid drawing while screenshot loading.\nYour iPad is generation 1 or 2? if it's iPad1, the cpu speed is the problem.\"\nthere are a implementationin xcode  to define if the user is ipad 1 or two , automatic and  use one specifications or others, it\u00b4s posible?\n\nPages blinking on Ipad\ni only use three cards for no blinking efecct, but \"pugpig solution\" don\u00b4t have this problem ( have others...) then i think its not only a problem ipad1 cpu ....\n. yes , you need a certificated ID and developer certificates by apple? you know about this?\n. but you try whit more pages and the index.html?\n. thanks\n. i see my new magazine in ipad 2 with three cards mode and \" casi me hecho a llorar\"  thanks a lot for baker, it\u00b4s the project i am most love in time....\nit\u00b4s lovelly in ipad2, soft transition clean and quikly.......\nI never come back adobe i promise ....\nand only for the ears of @folleto and for close this post\nnewstand integration ....jajajajajajaj, kiss\n. please, delete this post ....don\u00b4t make the work of the thiefs easy, jajajaj\n. adobe export all like images , and interactions are in a xml ( i think), but export a screenshoots of indesing , of this i am sure....even some solutions based in indesing open photoshop for make this...\ni am not afraid of have a opened book, for me is right, when i am dead i don\u00b4t want nothing of my desings whit me....even for some people y send my book for testing.\n. jqerymobile\n. i use the last version of baker whit three cards mode , dreamweaver how editor , but i typing the code manually...thanks\n.

    "josearellano": "I'm using BakerFramework in order to use multiple hpubs. I can download any hpub from aour server and update and manage them, but i have a problem, its about memory. For any reason I can not release the memory any time I close the reader, I debuged the application and I released it never use the Dealloc method. The application crash because of memory problems.  Thanks.\n. Yes I tried it, and the problem seem to be that the application fill the memory. I don't see leaks. I'm using the RootViewController as another UIViewController, and I tried to add this viewcontroller with 2 differents ways, first adding this with [ presentmodalviewcontroller...] and the other one with a simple [ addsubview]. Both of them ways have a problem. When I try to close the view controller, for example in the case of a modal with [ dismissModalViewControllerAnimated...] the function Dealloc never its called, so the reader never cleans the memory, so after read some hpubs the application crash for memory space. Thanks a lot for your answer. :) \n. Yes, we had to change a little the code. in order to get to the dealloc method we had to present the view controller like a modal. Also we modified the way of getting the touches. And finally in order to improve the way of release memory, at the moment of releasing we removed all the views inside the scrollviewcontroller. Excuse me for the bad english. If you want I can share with you the class modified, but tomorrow. Here it's 22:52 . Good bye.\n. How can I share what I did?\n. I would like to upload these files to the github, if it's possible.\n. ",

    "Bobramyl": "Hello everyone,\nI would like to share our progress with shelf / advanced version of reader. I think screens will speak for themselves soo, here you go: http://imgur.com/a/XPBeX#1\nI made heavy modifications to Baker base code (which was mostly inevitable to get things rollin'). I also created shelf using AQGridView (well, I had to modify that one too..). As of today, application can:\n- Load publication database from remote server (uses core data to store them which allows offline usage)\n- Download publications. I wrote entire network on both sides (PHP on server side / Obj-C / ASIHTTP in application), so am not using baker native downloader (I needed a lot more flexibility to work with core data).\n- Open any publication. Also book integrity validation is present, if book is corrupted, it will automatically download it again. And it also supports autoupdates from remote server (for now, it update whole book, I might reconsider to differential updating if I had time, which I currently don't).\n- New toolbar is added to top of the view. It's customizable and I'm working on functions which will allow to search through entire book, create notes, even draw to views.\nAm doing this project for one of the largest university in country, so at the end, there will be all edu materials available (for free). That's why it needs to be that powerful.\nAs I promised, I will share whatever code I can, but at first, I need to finish it. My deadline is within few weeks.\nHope you enjoyed a little preview.\nSincerely, George\n. I'm using last baker out there (3.2) and books are not using laker that much, they take some of its parts but they are all made from scratch. Don't worry, I know how to keep code up-to-date :)\nAs of InApp purchase & newsstand, that's actually pretty easy because I already made those for another App and due to heavy usage of core data, implementation should be walk in the park. BUT the client does not want such integration in this app, so I might provide my inapp class so you can integrate it for yourself (it's really rather easy).\n. I've uploaded inApp purchase manager to GIT, it's singleton and it's pretty easy to use + customisation is only about changing the kickOff method & product identifiers. Also usable in simulator, which is great.\nhttps://gist.github.com/2304762\nHope it will help somehow / somebody :)\n. I will have to make some changes first due to licensing (I just can't share full code even if I want to - it's huge private project after all), but I will try hard to push anything ASAP. I will most definitely keep you guys informed :)\n. I got yet another update & preview, I've successfuly implemented fullscale search of entire book so that might be very interesting update for baker.\nhttp://imgur.com/duRSf\nI will post code for this part within few days.\n. Hi guys, I've added ability to mark text within any book page you want and store it, so you can create your own marks just like iBooks. The difference is that you can then click send -> highlights and that will take selected texts and fill mail contents with them (might actually have very good use if you want to send citations etc.). Also you can mail current selection (second option), so no highlight is required in this case. Feedback appreciated, also I will wait for your opinions.\nhttp://imgur.com/EYgKE\nRegards, JT\n. That's probably very good idea - i did not consider it though because the application I'm making should allow citations / copying in the first place. But hey, I could add an option, it's like 5 minutes.\n. It's fully functional with no known bugs and all features implemented, its going to AppStore as we speak, I will then post link for itunes download & some parts of code. Please bear in mind that even I would like to share entire codebase of final version, I'm tightly locked by contract. But I will do my best :)\n. That indeed is, but it all depends on where you live etc. But as I already said, I'd like to share it, so you know :)\n. feel free to contact me (info [at] chuckdesign [dot] cz)\n. Well played! :)\n. Naw, it's really not possible, becouse there is no way to subclass UIWebView so you can add your own touch handlers / gesture recognizers (a lot of things will sieze to work). I had to make workaround with another UIView to get user interaction above the UIWebView and it's still not 100%valid solution, but hey, works.\nAs of update, I've checked it and it looks sweet, keep up good job guys :)\n. If that's the only thing you want, then you probably could remove scroll view entirely in rootViewController.m:141-150. Some additional modifications may be required but that's what I would do.\n. Am using MASTER from GitHub. \nI logged my actual values from index view:\n-> page width 768\n-> page height 1024\n-> index width 10\n-> index height 200\n-> actual index width 10\n-> actual index height 200\nSo it seems that it takes 10px out of view through the \nindexWidth = [self sizeFromContentOf:webView].width;\nand that's it. So it seems that i have problem that somewhere in my CSS is wrong body width? I've checked it two times and I also tried to set width:768px to body, but it seems unaffected. I then tried to manually override the value I get from view by adding another line (indexWidth = 768 && indexWidth = 1500) but that only shows menu, scroll is still not working.\n. If you can provide me with na email adress, I will send you the whole pack, which is probably better idea anyway. My email is info@chuckdesign.cz , so you can send it there, then we can continue discussion here\n. Hey @Simbul,\nI really, really appreciate your help. Yes, it really worked. The problem is apparently somewhere in .css, since there is really a lot of them sometimes overlaping each other. I will dig it into this later, but it works flawlessly as temporary fix. I hope I will be able to repay your help soon.\nPs. sorry for my late answer, I was out of... well out of there :)\nThanks again\nGeorge\n. Am currently working on full-book search, will post code as soon as it's finished (proly week or so). I do recommend you to create NSArray with all strings as contents of pages (create scanner and process all files), then search them using any search function you want (substring is useful here). If you have page numbers with occurances, you can highlight words you want by using javascript. Profit. Or wait :)\n. ",
    "nurtext": "@Bobramyl Great work! Can't wait to see the source pulled into the repo. Newsstand would be great and InApp purchases, too\u2026 :)\n. @Bobramyl Thanks for sharing! When can we expect the code for the shelf? Can't wait to test it :)\n. @Bobramyl Very impressive, keep up the good work! :)\n. @Bobramyl Impressive! You should consider an option, added to book.json, to control if citation/copying is allowed. iBooks disallows copying text regarding copyright issues. \n. +1\n. The contract is useless, what matters is the opensource license under which Baker is released and as far as I know this clearly describes how to handle opensource\u2026 ;-)\n. Would be great :)\n. A bookmarking feature would require much work\u2026 you need at least 2 gui parts: A button to bookmark and a list to show the bookmarks. It's much easier to implement using HTML5 localStorage. For example: Show a button and save the current page to localStorage if tapped. On a separate HTML file you could easily read out the localStorage and show the stored bookmarks in a way it integrates nice to your book's layout/design. \n. Btw: I'm currently implementing this feature in the example book\u2026 I'll push the code into the repo when it's done :)\n. Done! Demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uask5OsCd6k&hd=1\n. Fixed\u2026\n. Superb :)\nWe should update the wiki though\u2026\nEdit: done\n. It seems the baker snapshots that gets created dynamically (if not provided within the book) cause the trouble. They are stored within the Documents path and that's clearly against the guidelines. I've written a small fix that uses the Caches path instead and will pull it into the repo.\n. Damn forget about it\u2026 seems I used an outdated version of baker\u2026\n. @folletto As much as I like them :)\nAnyway\u2026 have been able to test the source from my pull request?\n. Great, didn't even know you're doing progress meetings on a regular basis :)\n. Since we now have in-app sending of emails I would like to have in-app browsing of webpages as well. Unfortunatly I'm not a coding pro in Obj-C/Cocoa Touch, so it would be nice if anyone could do the job\u2026 +1 for this feature request :)\n. Should be possible, but I didn't tested it\u2026 but you could easily setup a test scenario. \n. Thanks @Simbul. Of course I did take the bookmark images from iBooks, didn't had time to create it on my own. Rewrite shouldn't be a big deal, but using LocalStorage isn't possible as far as I know. LocalStorage was designed for single documents and doesn't work on multiple documents (html files). Because of this restriction I decided to use WebSQL. Didn't heard anything about W3C dropping support for it\u2026 :-(\n. I'll give it a try, thanks @folletto \n. Thanks @Simbul. Having a index view on top or on the right side would be cool. Maybe you could the issue into feature request for an upcoming version?\n. ",

    "zonkzen": "Does anyone know if https://github.com/nin9creative/baker is free for commercial use?\n. It's not fully complete, but really ready to be used!\nI'll contact him, thanks.\n. I have tried to use the code above for my implementation of an app based on Baker, however I can't make it to work. I fixed all the obvious errors in code above, but I simply cannot make \"window.addEventListener('storage'...\" to work. It never catches any events. I can see that localStorage is modified (variables are being set), but no notification being fired. \nI can also see in safari debugger that Baker (as stated in docs) fires 4 instances of WebUI (index and 3 normal \"pages\") so this problem shouldn't be caused by some already existing explanation which is: \"Storage change event is only triggered by separate browsers/tabs\". \nCan anyone help me out/suggest anything about it? Maybe someone could share some code?\n. rokanne, thank you for your answer!\nHowever, your code has to check localStorage each and every second. I think it's a little bit too much - this should work based on event 'storage-has-changed'. \nDo you (or anyone else) can confirm that asking for localStorage every second is the way to go?\n. I made some pretty extensive testing and whatever I do with localStorage on index or other pages is not being picked up by other pages. Simply saying the event 'storage' is not being sent at all. I don't know if that's problem with Baker or UIWebView. There's no exception or warning, nothing. \nSo in the end I went with interval in js solution. It's working really fast (average 0ms :) ), but still I feel it's hackish. If anyone will find a way to use native event, please let me know how (here or msg).\nThanks!\n. Ok. Can you confirm that it's a problem with UIWebView ?\n. ",
    "medaura": "I'm assistant publisher at a small but by no means indie magazine. Our publication spent a lot of money to develop a native iPad app the dinosaur way and we just found out that the development firm that produces it for us will no longer support it in the near future. I've been quietly following Baker's development and if this shelf issue is solved, I'll try to convince my team to reinvent our app in the Baker framework. \nI'm going to look into Andrew's work soon to see if it's suitable for our needs, but I was really wowed by George's (Bobramyl) screenshots. \nGeorge, may I ask how close you are to sharing usable code?\nAnd Davide,\nCould you please clarify something for me, in regards to what was already asked by kremisi about bypassing Apple? We would like to transition from in-app purchases to a subscription bundle, whereby all our subscribers get access to our app. Your reply to kremisi was a bit too technical for me to fully wrap my head around. Would you mind spelling it out for me? How could I send a Baker-shelf app to subscribers via email or login, without publishing in the Newsstand or App Store at all? \nIf this could be done, I'm confident I can persuade my team to move in this direction, which would make me very happy, as I'm itching to do things this way. Our publisher is considering paying for WoodWing and Adobe DPS, but I think it would be a waste.\nMany thanks in advance!    \n. So Davide,\nAre you saying it's impossible to implement a web-app with Baker? Offline storage? It was in that context that I was thinking of web downloads. \nThe reason I want to bypass Apple is not about saving money, but giving print subscribers access. Big publishers have apps that allow both subscriptions as in-app purchases, AND validation of their existing subscribers. This second element is a big pain to get together, as it involves API calls to whomever manages your digital entitlements and whatnot. So if you go through the App Store and implement in-app purchases (which we currently are), it's very hard to give existing subscribers access. \nI was thinking that with a web-app behind a login wall on our website, we could get around these headaches. We'd sacrifice revenue from in-app purchases, but that would be negligible. The most important thing for us is to be able to give existing subscribers an iPad version of the magazine.\nI've been getting so impatient that I even considered laying out the magazine in iBooks Author, and give subscribers access to the .iba file, but the design limitations of iBooks Author templates are too much to swallow. \nI thought that if the Baker Shelf were pure HTML5, then it could work as a web app and do the trick, but perhaps I am missing something. In any case, if anyone here thinks he could make it work with some custom development, please let me know. We're willing to pay market rate to get it done. And, for a discount, we'd be open to making the code open source. \nAny other tips or advice would be most welcome.\n. p.s. a lose example is Aside Magazine, from the maker of Laker. \nhttp://asidemag.com/\nIt works as a web-app on the iPad, but it has no shelf. We'd want to do the same but with a shelf for multiple issues.\n. I think I'm beginning to understand now: When I thought of Baker, I focused on the book folder and hpub. But I guess the whole point of Baker is to wrap that into a native app, to go into the app store. Hmmm.... Of course! \nCould what I am talking about be done anyway? A shelf environment with offline storage fully made in HTML5? Could anyone give some tips and direction?\nThat example is from Laker's author, but he collaborated with someone else.\n. Ah, yes, it was the book that you collaborated on. My bad.\nSo now I am wondering to what extent I can possibly use Baker for my publication's needs. Is the shelf solution Andrew has built all in HTML5? If so, I could perhaps only use that, and ignore the part of Baker that wraps the shelf into an app. \n. ",

I would be really happy! ;)\ncool! \nIt's a pity, that i can't release the magazine I did for my thesis (\"zuviel\", see \"about\"). It's got 17 dossiers and a lot of cool stuff...

Ouuuh 2.0! \nI'll take a look how to include it into Laker (or if its even necessary to include it).\nbest regards\nflorian\n. Hey everybody!\nLaker is now updated with the 2.0 Version of Baker. We added the Laker-Features and updated the Starter Pack.\nhttp://www.lakercompendium.com/2011/04/28/laker-now-includes-the-new-baker-version-2-0/\nIf you find some errors, please let me know!\nFlorian\n. Hey Laurence,\ngreat to hear that! Wow! Do you submitted it to the App-Store?\nCheeeerio,\nflorian\n. ;D Cool. Ah \"Laurence from australia\". Just got back to you via Email ;D\ncheerio\n. Hey folletto,\nhere are some of the things I like to see (besides the changes already made in Laker):\n- Preloading of Pages for faster Page swiping\n- Support for  (currently the app quits and opens safari with the content of the iframe ;D)\nWhen I'm discovering something else, I let you know.\nFlorian\n. I didn't have time to work on it, but if you want to check it out, just install the starter-package and run the code on an iPad. It's the same app.\ncheers\nflorian\n. I hope that's not meant ironically ;D\n. Hey Paul-B!\nWanna share the link to that publication?\ncheers\nflorian\n. \"Also, it would be nice to have a setting (inside RootViewController.m for example) to disable the swiping between pages - so you can only go to another page by clicking on a link.\"\nBut then you wouldn't need Baker. You could build it as a normal website and ask users to \"save it to homescreen\". \nflorian\n. Hey guys, \nI'm going to update laker next week, I'm totally busy right now...\ncheers\nflorian\n. Romain gave a hint in the Laker-Comments:\nAbout iFrames, this is due to the way Baker handles load request in the web view. \nThe hack is to make some changes in the following method in the RootViewController:\n- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType\nYou could, for example, change the last else condition into:\n} else {\n  // ****** Handle: *\n  return YES;\n  //[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[request URL]];\n}\nthat should do the trick.\nThis is just a start, it would need a little more investigation. Hope it'll help nevertheless.\nBest regards,\nRomain\n. Does anybody did it?\n. it's really weird, that it works 1 in ten times. First I assumed it's a memory problem or something like that...\n. Any news about the videos...?\n. posted in the apple dev forums, because the bug is also in mobile safari:\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/118951?tstart=0\n(login required)\n. yeah that sounds like a good thing to do!\n. I got the GM installed on my iPad 2. Looks good.\nBtw: Did I send you the link to the magazine I did with the three-cards-version?\nIf no: http://itunes.apple.com/app/id460041187?mt=8\ncheers\n. JS-Animations are baaaaaaaad on an iPad because they are not hardware accelerated...\nI tried a animation I built with HYPE and -webkit-animation. And in both cases, it started when loading not when displayed. Maybe there is a solution with js (I know that there are some scripts, which trigger when the object is in the viewport)\ncheeers and thanks a lot a lot a lot you guys!\n. Hey foletto,\nnot yet, but I'm working on the link...\nJS-Animations are also NOT delayed...\n. that's a clever idea, folletto! ;D\n. yeah\n. Do you know the code that has to inserted into the xcode files? That would help me also! ;)\n. allright! Thank you!\n. ;) \n. A theming engine would indeed be great.. ;)\n.

    "danupoyner": "Hi everyone. I have been following this issue with interest. Just wondering if anyone has a realistic estimate of how long until this feature is implemented. I have a digital magazine made with Baker and am currently working on the second edition. Would love to be able to take advantage of the fully-implemented shelf in time for that, but of course this may not be possible. If not, what do people suggest is the best way to release a new edition (ie new Hpub) so that either/both are available to read within a single app?\n. I've been testing the Shelf code (ae6b631) and it seems to be coming together well. However, when I use my own hpubs it crashes when it loads... I'm still quite n00bish with all this but it seems like it's choking on something in the .json file. Have the requirements changed?\nAlso, have you settled on image dimensions for the covers?

Another question... the Shelf now displays the app in Newsstand. My understanding is for an app displayed in Newsstand to be approved by Apple it has to have in-app purchase. What's your position with this? Will the guts of the shelf still work without the flag to display in Newsstand?\n. Ok, that helps. To clarify - I can either bundle the multiple issues with the app and release an app update to put out a new issue, or I can use Newsstand to push out updates remotely but I need to build on the 4.0 code myself to add the required features? There is no middle option whereby I push out issue updates remotely but the app is not Newsstand enabled?\n. I thought you'd be interested to know that I found out the reason the app was crashing (shelf branch) when I opened one of my books is because I had -baker-index-height set to 'null'. As soon as I put in a value (eg 200) it opened fine.\nAlso, can we confirm the final size for the book thumbnails? As far as I'm aware, Newsstand requires 100x150 images. The shelf currently uses something a bit wider than that I think.\n. Sure, if you sign up on my Testflight you can download my current build and see it in action http://tflig.ht/PYio7Q\n. And yes, same behaviour in 3.2. It's like it holds the stylesheets in memory between books...\n. Probably! Pardon my ignorance, but how would you like me to do that? :)\n. Ok I'll do that tomorrow - just gone past midnight here!\n. Ok, that makes sense. I have been having a bit of a play and made the link calls 'different' as discussed. So far that seems to have exacerbated the problem, but at least I know that means it's having some effect. I think I will try reorganising the file structure instead and let you know how that goes.\n@Simbul I've not encountered the bug you mention - what do you mean when you say 'prevented' from loading the default book? I've had no crashes or errors when doing that. The only issue is when you use the book://local link from the popup index.html drawer - if you do that, the drawer persists over the top of the default book and you can't get rid of it (at least in the case of Laker).\n. I figured! New magazine issues are every 2-3 months for me so I'll have fingers crossed the shelf will be ready for next time! Meanwhile I'll muddle through with this :)\n. I managed to squash the bug, I think, but in the end I resorted to completely changing my file hierarchy so there are no duplicate filenames between issues. It's the only way I've been able to reliably stop the caching from interfering.\n. ",
    "drking0211": "Sounds as though you are getting there with the shelf support and the multi issue problem.  \nI have spent the last month building a front end for the Baker framework whereby our Editors access a web portal and submit content (text, pictures, videos etc) to the back end SQL system which then auto generates the HTML pages; auto generates the TOC and Index for navigation and then moves all the various folders and files into the correct syntax.  \nOur Editors are over the moon with the new system as they are taken entirely out the tech loop and are able to produce apps in just a few hours which are error free ( well, for the most part), look beautiful and are consistent.\nBut Apple's remit for the Newsstand is fairly strict so I am anxious to try and get this worked out.\nSo any news on the 4.0 release would be very welcome.\nGreat job on the Framework.  Best out there in my opinion, by miles.\n. Not sure whether this is the same problem but using the JSON example in the WIKI documentation you will note there is an additional comma at the closing of the second publication definition followed by  \"...\".\nI removed the \"...\" as this is clearly an i.e statement but missed the second comma definition and had similar problems.\nOnce I removed it everything worked fine. \nAlso noticed that the old book.json file has changed with the new 4.0 and points to a new GFX directory which also caused XCODE to crash on my existing publications. \nSo using the example json file from the Scarlett book I made changes to my existing json and added the new directory and Hey presto it all worked.\nHope that is of some help.\n. I had exactly the same problem and for some reason my previous book folder was missing the gfx folder and the odd comma was wrongly referenced in the JSON file up on the server.\nAnyways, I fixed it by using the book.json file from the working Scartlett download book and replacing my page definitions (is 1.html, 2.html and so on.\nI then copied the gfx folder from the Scarlett download into my book folder (hitherto this was missing).\nI then cleaned, deleted the app from my iPad and built again and it all worked okey dokey.\nHope that helps.\n.

    "fourthversion": "I wrote a solution for it for a friend. The trick was  in webViewDidFinishLoad:. I'm assuming that UIWebView calls out to the delegate in the same thread it is finishing the load call. So while your delegate receives the message that the web view is finished loading, you see a delay. So when the call unhide the web view is performed it causes a \"jitter\" if you will and you see the old page before the new page.  The way I solved it was by creating a function (-(void) revealWebView:(UIWebView) webView and replaced the direct webView reveal call with this one via performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:. This allowed the webview to actually finish loading (in my opinion) and the reveal to occur after the page is loaded.  The code is below. FWIW.\n- (void)webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView )webView {\n  // Sent after a web view finishes loading content.\n// If is the first time i load something in the currPage web view...\n  if (webView == currPage && currentPageFirstLoading) {\n      NSLog(@\"(1) currPage finished first loading\");\n```\n  // ...check if there is a saved starting scroll index and set it\n  NSString *currPageScrollIndex = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@\"lastScrollIndex\"];\n  if (currPageScrollIndex != nil) [self goDownInPage:currPageScrollIndex animating:NO];\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(onTouch:) name:@\"onTouch\" object:nil];\n//[self loadSlot:+1 withPage:currentPageNumber + 1];\n  //[self loadSlot:-1 withPage:currentPageNumber - 1];\ncurrentPageFirstLoading = NO;\n  ```\n}\n// /!\\ hack to make it load at the right time and not too early\n  // source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1422146/webviewdidfinishload-firing-too-soon\n  //NSString *javaScript = @\"function myFunction(){return 1+1;}\";\n  //[webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:javaScript];\n[self spinnerForPage:currentPageNumber isAnimating:NO]; // spinner YES\n  //[self webView:webView hidden:NO animating:YES];\n  [self performSelector:@selector(revealWebView:) withObject:webView afterDelay:.1];\n  }\n-(void) revealWebView:(UIWebView*)webView {\n    [self webView:webView hidden:NO animating:YES];\n}\n. @folletto :) I don't mind not getting the credit. Ultimately my solution was just a quickie solution. I think the ultimate solution should do something more than just reveal the web view, possibly handling the passing of the parms for hidden and animating. If you really want me to I can do it the way 'I' think it should be written. But if you (I'm assuming this is your framework) want to take a stab at the true solution then go for it. Just let me know, I can go either way. \n. ",

Ok sorry ;)\n. Ok, thanks, and Full screen swipes?\n. Ok thanks!\n. Think you could replace outside xCode, directly in my project folder files like Baker AppDelegate.m. h, etc ...? or should do it from Xcode?\n. - Added book to version 1.1\n- Rename project- Change \"Organization Name \"\n- Testing App --> ALL OK\n- Added icons to the folder\n- Modify .plist to set image icon\n- Testing App --> ALL OK\n- Modify .plist to remove the icon effect\n- Testing App --> ALL OK\n  I explain step by step how the error occurred, thanks\n- Added two files to the project for the language: \"InfoPlist.strings\"  and \"Localizable.strings\"\n- Locate the two files\n- Testing App --> ALL OK\n- Modify .plist and added \"LSHasLocalizedDisplayName\" = YES\n- Testing App --> ALL OK\n- Locate the folder book in two languages \"en\" and \"es\"\n- I try to see if the contents change depending on the language.\n- Testing App --> The changes in the language \"are\" not visible\n- Clean the targets \"Build / Clean All Targets\"\n- Clean the cache \"xCode / Empty caches ... \"\n- Testing App -> White Screen- Reset baseline simulator\n- Testing App -> White Screen\n. Later...\n- Remove localization of \"Book\" folder\n- Testing app --> ALL OK\n. Hi, thanks for your response.\nWhat I do is locate the folder in Xcode Book \"Book / info button / Make file localizable. \"\n-Automatically creates two folders called \"en.lproj\" and  \"en.lproj\" with a subfolder \"book\" inside of both.\n- The program knows where to locate this folder \"book\" on the language that is set on your device - i don't have problems doing so in version 1.0- and thus the application is translated into two languages.\nYou're right, the problem is that the application can not find the folder \"book. \" I will review the localization process.\nKeep you informed\n. I'm reviewing the process and I do like to in version 1.0 but not working. The application can not find the folder \"Book\" localized trough xCode\nIt could be something different in the project settings?\nThanks ;)\n. Works! you're the best! You saved my week!!\n. Hi Davide,\n1. Baker 1.1\n2. Sorry for my \"Google English\" ... simply stops working swipe movement, the app still works.\n3. The taps are still running.\n4. I can pass you by mail a sample of our book ;)\n5. Try to spend a video, do you I can send it by email?\nKeep in touch!\n. Works fine! thanks a lot!\n. Yes!! sorry ;)\n. Thanks, is good news!\n. Works fine, thanks!\n. Thanks Folleto!! just in time! XD\n. Sorry, text editor of github compile the HTML code... even using the label\nI upload the first html file of my book:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/487370/001_01_portada.html\n. The title is the same. Do not be like this? \nI think there is problem with the paths. I will re-localize the project to match and then I comment.\nThanks!\n. Hi, \nI think that the problem is in the .html files format, Json seems that fail with the .html files in ASCII format, changing for UTF8 this files and Work fine ;)\n. Yes, sorry ;)\n. ",
    "mimetic": "Over at NimbleKit, the author says that one simply cannot make smooth page transitions from page to page, when each page is another HTML browser. That's how it's done in Baker, I understand, and that's how it is done with NimbleKit.\nThere is a solution, however. When you want a smooth transition, say between photos, you keep all the data on one HTML page and use JavaScript to change pages. I'm doing that with jQuery, and so far, it works fine.\n. I have updated with the \"three-card\" and there is an immediate problem. When I slide to a new page, if the new page has not loaded, there is only a white page to slide onto the screen. Or, if the page was loaded but has been cleared from memory somehow, the page that is to be slid onto the screen is white.\nWhen it works, it is great. However, it isn't reliable, and the white pages look bad, since I have black pages.\nPerhaps you could always preload the black page --- quickly --- then try to load the big, real page?\n. Perhaps we're barking up the wrong tree. I have slow load times because I have many photographs on the page. Shouldn't we look at having the page load quickly, meaning we don't load large images immediately, but allow them to load after the page loads? I am assuming the page is not considered loaded by the browser until all graphics are also loaded, and I could be wrong.\nI figure that rendering of a page without graphics should be quick, even if it is long.\n. FYI, I'm accomplishing the smooth page transitions inside the HTML page, using Javascript. I've also had to do some memory management, essentially \"unloading\" large images when not needed, to avoid memory errors. Perhaps the final solution is a mixture of both? \nFor example, I suspect my HTML pages should probably load the main info via Javascript, AFTER the initial page load. That way, the transition will be quick, even if the page is loading in the background.\n. Frankly, I'd prefer NOT to use the Javascript! I was simply forced to, since I don't program C! I mentioned it merely to suggest that the final solution might require both. I assume one cause of the white page-flash is the delay in loading large browser pages. Also, that loading a large page takes a lot of memory. So, a JS which shifted the loading might solve the white flash problem?\n. By \"shifted\" I mean, instead of the browser loading the entire page when the C programming opens the page, let Javascript do loading after the page is \"loaded.\" So the actual loading of the page information is done by the Javascript. An elegant solution, but it might help.\n. Such a solution would require either a Javascript loader (which I've seen somewhere), which loads external files, OR to put the page itself initially inside a DIV to render after loading. Would it be acceptable to provide an HTML template that users would have to comply with, e.g. putting their HTML in a particular part of the code?\n. (Since this issue was bounced over here, I'll have to address it here, right?)\nThe following code DOES delay the page loading. And, if I set the delay (afterDelay, at bottom) to 0.0, my pages loader faster. 1/2 second faster, actually. I don't see any stutter when pages change, so I'm not sure why this is necessary. \n- (void)gotoPageDelayer {\n  // This delay is required in order to avoid stuttering when the animation runs.\n  // The animation lasts 0.5 seconds: so we start loading after that.\nif (currentPageIsDelayingLoading)\n      [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(gotoPage) object:nil];\ncurrentPageIsDelayingLoading = YES;\n  [self performSelector:@selector(gotoPage) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.5];\n  }\n. Another idea:\nFollowing upon this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1422146/webviewdidfinishload-firing-too-soon), if we can send javascript to the page AFTER it loads, then we can command it to complete rendering. I'll see if I can mock this up.\n. And (sorry for the spray of ideas): Can you cache smaller pages with the three-page solution while forcing large pages to load (even if slowly)? This would mean small pages are smooth scrolls between them. This would be good, because then I could have single, simple HTML pages for, e.g. the forward contents, introduction, and that would feel natural. Then, between larger chapters, there might be a delay, but that's OK.\n. In response:\nI\n1) Gotcha. No templates, no JS requirements\n2) I remove it on trunk and three-cards. I have had some weird bad loads with three-card but I cannot reproduce them reliably. Seemly random, dammit.\n3) No templates, got it. \n4) OK.\nII.\nAfter finding out I could change the background color in the C code (I don't program C, by the way)....\nOK, I've just installed the three-page again, with one massive modification: I've changed the SCROLLVIEW_BGCOLOR to black because my HTML pages are black.\ndefine SCROLLVIEW_BGCOLOR blackColor\ndefine PAGE_NUMBERS_COLOR whiteColor\nHere's what I see:\n1) Looks great\n2) Occasionally, if I swipe from page 1 to 2, I get a flicker from page 3 for a quick moment. My page 3 (in this scenario) has a bright colored background, so the flicker is noticable, while it is NOT noticable in other cases (because of black backgrounds).\nI suspect that flicker is something like a page bounce effect of some sort. It seems the new page arrives in place, shows a fraction of the next page, then restores itself in place. A very slow swipe does not create this effect!!!\nIf this were resolved (and it is not terrible, just annoying), the three-card solution seems to work great. \nExcept with the iPad simulator, I get occasional and unpredictable wrong page loads. I can't figure that one out. E.g. I got backward and it has loaded the wrong pages. Might be combined with links in my pages. Sorry I can't be more detailed.\nIII.\nAdded something interesting. Since you took out the double-tap navigator bar in three-page, I've done this. My change is at line 775. I've made a single-tap call a page javascript function, allowing me to show my own nav bar. Better than a \"click\" event call, which does weird flashes and stuff.\n         [self changePage:page];\n```\n} else if (touch.tapCount == 1) {\n    //NSString *javaScript = @\"BakerSingleTap();\";\n    [currPage stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@\"showNavigator();\"];\n    NSLog(@\"Hey! do my JS!: showNavigator();\");\n} else if (touch.tapCount == 2) {\n    [self performSelector:@selector(toggleStatusBar) withObject:nil];\n}\n```\n. And, whatever changes you made with the tapping and scrolling also disabled my javascript scrolling. DAMN!\n. FYI, I have a working JavaScript swipe going, extending from Laker. The JS builds the swipable area using templates, etc., it load/unloads images, etc., to reduce memory use, although I still have trouble with multiple page loads taking memory. Or something.\nHowever, it seems unstable. At times, images won't load. Rotating and tapping enough can confuse it.\nI'll package up a reduced size version of the latest iteration so you all can play with it.\n. Here it is: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13346155/book.zip\nI made it only two chapters, for testing, and the images are more compressed.\n. The flash I'm seeing with \"three cards\" is from a bounce effect. When I swipe quickly, the screen scrolls to the next page (good) but then continues to the next-next page for a second, and then bounces back. Can you tune the deceleration to avoid that? That would solve a lot!\n. OK, I've been perusing everyone's scrolling pages, and everyone (including Apple samples) have this issue. However, they also seem to have the next-next page loaded...or they match backgrounds. In other words, the bouncing is probably here to stay. Let's look consider at loading not 3 pages, but 5. \n. Swiping: OK, the JS swiping only happens in 0010.html and 0020.html files. Go to the \"Fire\" chapter, and you should be able to swipe to the left, showing the images.\nBounce: I don't think it is technically a \"bounce.\" Rather, swiping a page quickly makes it scroll just a little beyond the actual page. Try swiping very quickly. For that brief moment, the page beyond slides in, or nothing if there is no page to show. You can see this in most apps that scroll. I think it is not a bug, although it is odd. \n   scrollView.pagingEnabled = YES\nshould prevent this, by my reading, but I'm not a C programmer!\nMy pages are not supposed to be big, long pages, only screen size. Clearly, you can load screen sized pages without much trouble...other apps do it. \nI do wonder: my design creates a webview of a very large page. Maybe it takes a lot of memory to build & store a webview that is large in dimensions, e.g. 768 x 5000 pixels. There may be a smarter way to have images slide!\nI have quickly tested very compact HTML pages that only have one big image, and they work nicely. I had to build this whole Javascript mess because, well, the three-cards was not working! If you look at my JS code, you'll see it is very close to yours, in function. Simple memory management, preloading of pages, etc.\nAnother reason to build the swiping pages into one HTML page is that I didn't want to have a hundred HTML pages to maintain, to build the book.\n. --- The \"scrollView.pagingEnabled = YES\" command however will disable paging at all, so you won't have any more the automatically centered pagination.\nHuh. I use scrollView.pagingEnabled = YES, and it does not cause me a problem. So, I'm don't understand exactly what that means.\nI think the Javascript scroll is a bad idea, frankly. I would much rather have that kind of thing be more native, more part of the fast, basic coding.\nRegarding coding the pages, I am looking at a photo book! Baker is really not so good for this (yet), but I didn't know what else to do.\n. Extra height seems to appear when the nav bar is open upon rotate. A non-scrollable screen will become scrollable, the height will INCREASE by 20 pixels.\nIn line 807 of RootViewController.m,\n            NSLog(@\"Current page height: %d\", currentPageHeight);\nit seems that currentPageHeight shows the width. In Landscape, the height is reported to be  768 (unless nav is open and the iPad rotated, in which case it reads 788).\n. ",
    "jameskatt": "I would examine Chris Mayer's code to see how he accomplishes smooth transitions between HTML pages. http://www.chrismayerapps.co.uk/buycode/index.html\n. Yes, I'm interested in the capacity to do search within an eBook. Thanks.\n. Before considering the Baker Framework, I considered a similar framework, The TouchBooksReader, framework.  It has a search function and the capacity to download additional books with in-app sales. The only problem is that it costs $500 a book to use, $12,000 for the source code.  Thus, I am grateful for the work of the Baker team.\n. Yes, I did try it.\nThe author encrypts resources needed to compile and run the book in the iOS simulator.  And he encrypts the resources needed to compile the app for submission.  But he gives the encrypted framework to you free so you can try it out with the iOS simulator.  Then when you want to pay for each book you want to create, you pay him $500 and he gives you the key to compile the final code to send to Apple.  \nThe author is actually a very nice guy.  It is just too costly to create a series of books with him, as I would like to do.\nThe Book you create using this framework is any combination of HTML and CSS, just like the Baker Framework. One can add video, graphics, CSS Animations, etc.  When I saw the Baker Framework, my jaw dropped at how similar they are.  Of course, they are for the same goal.  The app store books made with the TouchBooksReader Framework are very very nice, I think.\nHowever, the TouchBooksReader Framework is at a more advanced state than the Baker Framework.  For example.\n1. Transition between HTML pages (i.e. chapters of the book) are very very smooth - unlike the jerky, slow transition  of the current Baker Framework.  Thus, TouchBooksReader apps feel like REAL Books, unlike the Baker Framework at this time.\n2. Search is enabled for the entire book.\n3. One can add Admob ads to the book.\n4. One can add in-app purchases of additional books.\n5. One is not limited to the 768 px CSS.  You can do sideways scrolling for larger graphics.\n6. One set of HTML files can work for both iPad and iPhone in both Portrait and Landscape.\n7. etc.\nSince the needed resources to compile the app are encrypted rather than open sourced, the TouchBooksReader framework would make me dependent on the author (remaining alive and working on the framework) for updates to keep the app compatible with the rapidly evolving and changing iOS so it doesn't crash on customers and get yanked out of the app store. This is one huge impediment.  \nOf course, the cost of the source code puts it out of reach - not only in money but particularly since it forces the user to learn how to code in X-Code in order to keep up with iOS changes - which is the point to avoid by using a framework in the first place.\nThus I hope the Baker Framework can evolve to at least a similar state as the TouchBooksReader Framework.\n. You'll have to email the author for the framework.  He'll send it to you.  It will only work on the iOS simulator with your html/css files. It can't be compiled to a final build until you pay him for the serial number. But you will be able to see his code techniques. \n. This link is dead.\n. Thank you very much.. Is this part of the Autorotate branch?  If it does allow rotation, that would be so cool.\n. I would love these additional features to fold into the main branch\n. I'd love to see a tool to de-construct the iBook Author file so that the components can be re-purposed by placing them in Baker.\n. I would love to see a version of Baker that can turn the iBook 2 format into an app!  Then we could have a very easy to use tool to design eBooks.\n. ",

I definitely agree with ffranke, a full screen inApp browser will be a great option\n. Thanks Fol. I don't know if this helps but we are working with the same bounce of files (html, css, js) in both the stable Baker 2.0 and the latest 'nightbuild'. Inside the stable versione the above bugs are mainly absent (especially the white flash)\nPlease let us know if we could perform some additional testing for you guys. We'll do it anyway ; )\n. ... as far as we understand those bugs are related to the UIWEBVIEW at preloading stage. We just performed the same test (first comment) with the build 85-g93fe8b4 but inside the brand new iOS5. Everything is smoother and the white flash occurred just on the heavier content after a non-sequential flip through the pages.\nNo doubt iOS5 introduced a lot of improvements but keep investigating the preloading matter still seem the way to gain a stable and robust environment. We hope to be able to contribute soon since we're (finally) starting a custom development project. In the meanwhile we don't want to loose the chance to say again: thank you guys for this great piece of work.\n. We tried to optimize our book as far as it was possible, and after a more detailed test we found:\n- 'three-card' rendering mode: Flash just when flipping more than 1 pages. \n- 'screenshot' rendering mode: always flash.\n.

No more white flash! \nBoth in \"screenshots\" and \"three-cards\" mode. Congrats! \nA side question about the \"three-cards\" mode: \nI ran my test with \"-vertical-bounce: false\" and noticed a jerky animation swiping between pages. Any idea? The problem mitigates if I enable \"vertical-bounce\" for both modes. Since I'm running out of the current issues I'll repost this in a new one.\n. ",

    "eaglejohn": "Can we get a quick example how to use anchors in Baker?\nRight now I'm using <a name=\"zoom01\" id=\"zoom01\" href=\"zoom/zoom-001.html\"> to link to a page and <a href=\"../001.html#zoom01\"> to go back. It's not working in Baker (it does in Safari), I guess I misread something :)\n. Thanks, I'll try this later if I still need it :)\n. I'm testing this at the moment and iframes are working fine: GREAT! However when I'm making a link in the iframe (to display other content in the iframe) Baker is quickly displaying the black loading screen + title) and then quickly fades out again. Safari desktop is displaying this without delay or loading, it's working awesome.\nDoes this has anything to do with \"referrer=Baker\" like @Xm4s mentioned? If so, where do I place this parameter?\nRight now I placed it like this:\n<a href=\"iframe-001-01b.html?referrer=Baker\">\nI tried switching off the Three-Card loading method, but that doesn't do the trick.\n. Ha, no that's not what I'm looking for :)\nAlright, so let's wait if @Xm4s can figure this out!\n. Yeah, it's working great, thanks! :)\n. Ah, I see I mixed up some files. Let's try again :)\nSome Wink-effects use specific JS-files like DND.js (Drag N' Drop: http://www.winktoolkit.org/documentation/module/712/)\nSome of these JS-files won't work in combination with \"jquery-1.5.min.js\" so I had to disable this script.\nI used Laker which doesn't support 'tapping' (yet?) so I thought disabling \"jquery-1.5.min.js\" killed the swiping-option, but that's not true I see now. I just tested it with Baker and indeed I can tap to switch pages, but can't swipe.\nIt seems that DND.js is killing the swipe-option in both Laker and Baker.\nIf someone wants to see my files to make things clear, just let me know.\n. There's a topic (about 2 months old) on their discussion-platform where someone notices a bug:\nhttp://www.winktoolkit.org/discussion/topic/puzzle-bug\nThere's also a solution for that particular bug on that page, but I don't know much about JS.\nAlso, I don't know if these modifications are already implemented in their latest version (I guess not), but if they are, then it's still killing the touch events :)\n. I also found out about this issue after creating some animations in Hype (which runs smoothly by the way!) and thought about a solution for a few days now. No real solutions came up yet ;)\nSome solutions:\nSolution 1: start your animation (which is on the next page) after X seconds.\nRemark: doesn't work, because you'll never know how long it takes someone to read the current page.\nSolution 2: build 'something' which tells the animation to start when that actual page is loading.\nRemark: doesn't work, because Baker does a pre-load of the next page and so the animation thinks it needs to start.\n'Best' idea so far: loop the animation so it will always be visible from start.\nBut I realize this isn't a solution in some (or many) cases. Works for pages like advertisements.\nI can send my files/animation for testing purposes.\n. I do have time and I'd like to try this, but my knowledge about JS is very poor.\nCan I just paste one of the examples between script-tags and then it should work?\n. Alright, I'll check it out!\nOff-topic: when I'm building my apps I'm making some changes on the original Baker Framework (icons, adding Google Analytics, re-design loading page, portrait/landscape, etc.). With every new master I have to do this over and over, is that right? Just curious, not complaining :)\n. Thanks! For now I'll change the UIColor in 'RootViewController.m'.\nFor my app I changed this rule:\ndefine SCROLLVIEW_BGCOLOR colorWithRed:0.592 green:0.109 blue:0.121 alpha:1.0f\nIf you know the RGB-values it's very easy to use your 'own' color, but you have to do some calculations to use this.\nJust divide every R/G/B value by 255.\nExample:\nMy RGB-values were: Red 151, Green 28, Blue 31 (dark red).\n151 / 255 = 0.592\n28 / 255 = 0.109\n31 / 255 = 0.121\nFor those who want to change the color of the spinner/loading-icon, change this rule (also in 'RootViewController.m'):\nUIActivityIndicatorView *spinner = [[UIActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhite];\n- UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGrey = grey spinner (Baker default)\n- UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhite = white spinner\n. Just tried and it works in Safari (desktop) but not in Baker.\n. In Laker I used to use a hack/workaround/trick which worked fine. In Baker this trick only works just once.\n056.html - add a button/link on this page which points to 057.html\n057.html - add this meta-tag to this document: \"meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=056.html\"\"\nMaybe this helps :)\n. Another suggestion: shake to reload?\nI'm definitely not a coder, but maybe this would be easy to integrate so we can switch it on or off in XCode?\nJust Googled a bit:\n- http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/4381-iphone-shaking-code.html\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/150446/how-do-i-detect-when-someone-shakes-an-iphone\nAlso a very cool and interactive feature :)\n. A little update:\nThe trick/hack I mentioned above is now working after a minor change.\nJust make sure the refresh-page isn't right next after the actual page.\nExample:\nContent on 056.html & meta-tag (refresh) on 057.html: doesn't work.\nContent on 056.html & meta-tag (refresh) on 099.html: does work\nStill not the most neat solution, but it works for now...\n. Yeah, it's really ugly but it works for now... :)\n. Any news on this yet? I'm working on an app which has an HTML5 drawing object (color book) included and I'd like to insert a button which reloads the page so you can make a new drawing :)\n. (Before reading my post, please notice that I'm using iOS 5.0 beta 4.)\nI just tried the latest master (g7e4c923) with the book-folder of one of my apps. It seems that a JS-animation (made in Hype) on the next page is already being activated when the current page is still being viewed. Also an audio file (mp3) keeps playing when you're swiping to the next page. I guess this is the same with a video file.\nAlso this version still seems to feel a pretty buggy when you're being 'rough' with scrolling and stuff, like @psmedia said.\nSometimes a page freezes and can't be scrolled vertically. You can only swipe to the next or previous page.\nWhen you swipe back to the frozen page it seems to recover itself and is working again.\nIn the version of 2011-08-04 I was able to scroll pages very quickly, but now that seems to be disabled? Now there's some kind of blocking for about a second before you can swipe again. Good thing is, I'm not seeing a loading page anymore :)\nAlso found out that \"#define PAGE_VERTICAL_BOUNCE NO\" doesn't seem to work anymore. When set to NO, it still bounces.\nOverall I think the version of 2011-08-04 was a lot more stable.\nI hope you guys can use this feedback! :)\nIf you want to use my book-folder for testing, I can provide it for testing purposes.\n. Yeah sure, if there'd be a place to share stuff, it'd be great!\n. Maybe you could place different .hpub-files on a server, so your reader can download the book after choosing their own language? Check the README file for using .hpub files, it's really simple!\n. Just tried it and it works. Only autoplay (HTML5) doesn't work.\n. I already turned that flag off (#define MEDIA_PLAYBACK_REQUIRES_USER_ACTION NO), so that won't help :)\nAutoplay (video) works in another page which is in the book. Is the index.html being loaded when opening the app, or is it idle until opening the table of contents?\nI just added the code: https://gist.github.com/1200126\n. Any news on this yet? :)\n. I just added the code at line 85 and it was working right away. Thanks!\n. Well, not huge features, but I was struggeling for some minutes why the \"box-shadow\" rule (CSS) did work in Safari Desktop and not working in the iPad Simulator (iOS 4.3). The fallback \"-webkit-box-shadow\" works in both, so no problem at all :)\nAlso some HTML5 features don't work well yet in iOS 4.3, like (figure) and (figcaption). Just small features which can be solved very easy, but this made me thinking about supporting \"older\" devices.\n. I tried it on my iPad with iOS 5.0, latest beta.\n. Just found something after a quick Google search: http://vetruvet.blogspot.com/2010/12/converting-single-touch-events-to-mouse.html. I'm going to try this later.\n. No afraid not... I contacted the author of the script and he pointed me in this direction:\n\"You will have to call the init function to add the event listeners. The following article shows how to point\u00a0touch\u00a0events\u00a0to mouse\u00a0events\": http://ross.posterous.com/2008/08/19/iphone-touch-events-in-javascript\nTo be honest I don't have a clue since I don't know anything about JS.\n. Time is a bit short at the moment, but I'll sure give it a try. Thanks @dandoen!\n. Just tried the code of @dandoen and it works right on, great!\nYou can download the modified script from my Dropbox: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17869072/html5-canvas-drawing-app.zip\nNext challenge: make the drawing canvas larger for the iPad screen :)\nEdit: just tried to make the canvas larger, but it really slows down the drawing and very angular lines.\n. No, didn't look into it yet. Hope I'll find some time soon! :)\nSent from my iPad\nOn Nov 14, 2011, at 2:21 PM, Davide Casali\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nDid you find anything? :)\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/142#issuecomment-2737641\n. Alright, so at the moment it's only possible to change #000000 into another color? I tried it and this is working, I'm using the latest master.\n. That's something I'd really like to know. At the moment I'm building an app for someone who says that tapping left and right isn't stable and with 'normal' use of the app I experiencing the same some time.\n\nEdit to be more clear: swiping seems to be more stable than tapping.\n. Sometimes you have to tap about 10 times before the page flips, sometimes only once. It's very different each time. Swiping seems to be more stable if you look at it that way :)\n. This CSS rule works for me:\noutline: none;\n. Do you think it could be possible to let the user make a screenshot for e.g. a drawing (#142) they made? And eventually share it on Twitter or Facebook?\n. Yeah sure:\nI'm looking for a simple way to create a zoom/enlarge function. I'd like to put a thumbnail on a page and when you click it, the larger image will be displayed.\nThat's all :)\n. Yeah I tried a lot of lightboxes and none of them seemed to work good in both portrait and landscape mode. Also some of them conflicted with jQuery (used in Laker). The best until now is Fancybox (as mentioned before), but it's quite heavy and doesn't display full screen.\nAfter trying a lot of lightboxes I thought about using a separate HTLM-page and this is working great, especially when you want to display an image full screen. The only problem is, it's messing up the pagination because (I think) you have to use subfolders. When you put the HTML-pages with enlarged content in the root folder, they become part of the normal pages which is not good :)\n. Haha, yeah I almost tried them all :)\nMost of them don't work properly in a book with both portrait and landscape mode and conflict with the JS used in Laker. But the most disappointing is that none of them support full bleed/screen :)\nWell, let's look further and hopefully I can find a better solution. Otherwise I'll stick to Fancybox...\n. I found an awesome jQuery plugin which is very light and very quick: o3Enlargebox. Just click on a thumbnail and a bigger image appears without fancy (and useless :)) shadows, close buttons, etc. Click again and it disappears.\nThe only problem at the moment is, that when you read in portrait mode, enlarged the image and then rotate the iPad to landscape, the box keeps its portrait dimensions. When you close the box and reopen it, the dimensions are OK.\n. Yeah I guess. There's a quick fade from black to white.\n. I'm using three-cards. The page which is being loaded inside the iframe is an HTML-page in a subfolder.\nI'll try to be more clear about the \"click content in iframe and swap page\":\nYour guess is right, on the page which is loaded in the iframe, there is a link which points to another page. This is a simple way to create a slideshow/click-trough without JS. The only issue right now is that, when you used this slideshow and you swipe to the next page in the book, a black fade/reload shows up.\nMy source code is available for testing (mail me).\n. Just switched from three-cards to screenshots and the fade is gone.\nBut isn't it strange that, when you use three-cards, the fade only appears after clicking in an iframe and not when you just swipe pages? I guess iframes are using too much memory?\n. Other question: is it possible to link to an app in the App Store without opening Safari?\n. Thanks for the info. I found out that it's the iPad Simulator who broke it, the link I created was ok :)\n. Thanks Davide, that's a nice project you're referring to. (Also this one: https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch).\nI've done some searching myself and found (http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/AdjustingtheTextSize/AdjustingtheTextSize.html) a CSS selector called '-webkit-tap-highlight-color'. Hopefully this will work with normal text as it works with buttons/links in their example.\n. ",
    "CatherineEng": "Hi - I'm attempting to do something like enable your item \"1\" in your list of 5 items above: \n1. Links from a page of the book to a page of the book with anchor, goes there correctly.\nWithout this, I am not able to have the page and book behavior I'm looking for, which is:\na) Tap an anchor link from a TOC page to go to a horizontal anchor in the destination page.\nb) Have this destination page reside in the book.json manifest.\nI am able to of course get the horizontal anchor to work in a page not included in the book.json list, since this forces the book app to open this page in a UIWebView, which obeys horizontal anchor links. However, what this means is that this new page basically replaces my TOC page, and thus will swipe left and right to the pages consecutively before / after the TOC page - not its own pages since it doesn't exist in the book.json chronology. \nIt would be great to be able to horizontally anchor on a page and still have this page swipe left or right to its own consecutive pages.\nI tried to create a goRightInPage pragma mark, and use this to modify the handleAnchor mark, but it didn't work. \nAny suggestions? \n. awesome! Lovely accomplishment. The crayon texture is especially nice. \n. Hi Davide,\nThank you very much for your reply. \nI think your idea to implement something using Javascript  will work - after I contacted you, I was able to implement an area without swipe using William Malone's drawing app - it uses javascript to define an area for the paint canvas, and his method effectively creates a no-swipe zone within the coordinates / width / height that are specified... see lines 24 and 25 for the canvas; 51-54 for the drawing area; and from line 644 onwards where the canvas element is drawn on the page. \nAnd also - thank you so very much for Baker. It is an incredible framework, and all of your ingenuity and creativity and generosity is doing a tremendous amount  towards pushing mobile applications to the next level.\nBest,\nCatherine\n. Thanks for replying. In a nutshell - this is all for the sake of being able to link to the right-hand side of pages of my book. in the process, I'm sharing the bit of orientation support for magazine pages that I've come up with, see the link below. \n1. I am using Baker 3.2.\n2. I tried my code (not Xcode, just HTML / CSS / Javascript in the /book file) on a fresh download of 3.2 from the latest master on git as you suggested. \n3. Here are some sample files from the orientation support / horizontal anchor link feature I made for a book I'm working on: https://github.com/CatherineEng/Orientation-Support-for-Books\nBelow are some steps to view my orientation support feature. Before I get into those let me explain how I got here. \nBasically, I want my book to display a left page and right page in landscape mode, then only a left or right page in portrait mode, as most ebooks and magazines do. \nTo make a nice transition on orientation switch from portrait to landscape, I wrote a simple bit of CSS in a media query. This works great. No weird flashes / pauses on orientation, just nearly instantaneous CSS transition. You can see what I've done by looking at media-queries.css and looking at the container classes in the file destination.html.\nIn other words, the spreads in my book are each a single .html file, with facing left and right page \"containers\".\nThe problem is when I try to access the right page container in one of these .html files in portrait mode from another page of the book. It defaults to the left container, since it is on the top left, (0,0) of the destination page.\nI tried a few things in the Baker Xcode, like created a goRightInPage variable in the Page Scrolling pragma similar to goUpInPage and goDownInPage, but thought I might be able to do things more simply after all with javascript. \nSo here are my experiments so far. To view them, please open up origin.html in a browser (adjust window width to 768px wide) or add it to your book.json file and view in portrait mode in the iOS simulator:\n1. Click Link A:  Goes straight to right-hand container!  I can get a direct jump to the right-page container if I add a <body onload> event in the destination file itself but this isn't ideal, because sometimes I will want the page to land on the left container. (See \"A\" in the origin.html file) I use a window.scroll event to a coordinate to do this, not an anchor link because of that webview issue for anchor links in Baker  (This actually worked... in the sense that the origin file a href anchor link jumped to the right-page container. However, since it IS an anchor link, and Baker calls anchor links in a webview, the destination page appears in a webview. The only problem with this, is that then the page actually drops on top of the orientation page so the previous / next pages are that of the origin page, not the destination page, which would be confusing to readers). In any case, this proves that it's possible to jump to a right-page from a link from another page.\n2. Click Link B: Will land on the left-hand container, but click to the right-page container! Once I am on the destination page, viewing the left-page container, I can click a link to anchor to the right-hand page. This proves horizontal anchor links do work. \n3. Click Link C: Lands on the left-hand container, and that's about it. The problem arises when I try to have the origin page jump to the right-hand container of the destination page with a conditional script. A variable passed from the origin page in the URI causes some iteration - the application has to decide how to handle this unusual link and tries to open it as a webview, decides it doesn't need to, and by then, just deposits you on the default left container of the page, forgetting all about the anchor or scroll script / detect. \nSo... if you could help point me in the right direction of how to write some variable into the origin link, that could be passed to the destination page so the destination page will obey either a straight anchor link (some modifications to Xcode necessary) or a javascript function to scroll or anchor to the right container,  that would be great. \n. Hi, thank you so much Folletto for your response. I did try it, but as my pages have so much javascript already, and almost every page needs this right-page target feature, I had some help from the fabulous @mmackh who added this to the page scrolling pragma in RootViewController.m, line 1512 (but after the goUpInPage and goDownInPage statements):\n```\n- (void)scrollPage:(UIWebView )webView to:(NSString )offset animating:(BOOL)animating {\n    [self hideStatusBar];\nNSString *jsCommand;\n\nif (pageWidth == [offset integerValue])\n{\n    jsCommand = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"window.scrollTo(%@,0);\", offset];\n}\nelse\n{\n    jsCommand = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"window.scrollTo(0,%@);\", offset];\n}\n\nif (animating) {\n    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.35 animations:^{ [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:jsCommand]; }];\n} else {\n    [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:jsCommand];\n}\n\n}\n\n\n(void)handleAnchor:(BOOL)animating {\nif (anchorFromURL != nil) {\nif ([anchorFromURL isEqualToString:@\"menuanchor\"])\n{\n    NSString *offset = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%d\", pageWidth];\n    if(!UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape([UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation)) {\n        [self scrollPage:currPage to:offset animating:animating];\n    }\n    anchorFromURL = nil;\n}\nelse\n{\n    NSString *jsAnchorHandler = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"(function() {\\\n                                 var target = '%@';\\\n                                 var elem = document.getElementById(target);\\\n                                 if (!elem) elem = document.getElementsByName(target)[0];\\\n                                 return elem.offsetTop;\\\n                                 })();\", anchorFromURL];\n\n    NSString *offset = [currPage stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:jsAnchorHandler];\n\n    if (![offset isEqualToString:@\"\"]) {\n        [self goDownInPage:offset animating:animating];\n    }\n    anchorFromURL = nil;\n}\n\n}\n}\n\n\n```\nAnd then any time you want to target a right-hand page, include #menuanchor in your link i.e. <a href=\"http://yourlink.com#menuanchor\">\nWorks like a charm. :-) \n. Hi Alessandro,\nThe issue wasn't that I could not see the Safari button - it's that I could see it, and wanted to somehow remove it. We have since removed it based on @Folletto's instructions, so there is just the Back button (which we renamed Done) and the back / forward arrows. \n( Oh - you mean the landscape bug issue. Let me see if I can find a screenshot of it not appearing in landscape mode...)\nReally enjoying working with Baker. You guys have created something amazing. Can't wait to show you our application. If you are interested, please PM me your UDID - you and @Folletto both. Thanks again.\nBest,\nCatherine\n. Hi Davide,\nHow are you? Thanks for replying. \nI'm using Xcode 4.3.3. / Lion 10.7.5.\nI suppose if all else fails I could simply manually create the screenshots, naming them using the same conventions and doing a set for both orientations...? Three-cards works so nicely and without the screenshots in my latest build it feels like something is missing.\nBest,\nCatherine\n. Hi - in the logs I get this message after I startup in the simulator. Does that mean the issue is not using screenshots? They are in the directory.\n\u2022 Reset page details array and empty screenshot directory\n. Hello Alessandro - thanks. That does indeed help things :-D Silly oversight on my part. Once I had captured the screens I switched it to three-cards to make use of the caching.. then duplicated the project and never changed that value back in the new book.json file. \nOne thing I noticed is that if the parameter \"-baker-page-screenshots\": \"images/screenshots/\" is still in the book.json file, even though the parameter \"-baker-rendering\": screenshots is set and the folder is created for the screenshots - none of them appear to save from the simulator. The application must think there are already screenshots - so that line has to be temporarily removed to do the screenshots as well. \nThis is probably not something most people would have to worry about, only if you were doing multiple issues and iterating on top of each one rather than starting from an original book.json file. \nThanks again!! You saved me a ton of time.\n. Yes, it's very logical that the application wouldn't waste resources saving screenshots again with this parameter present. This issue is resolved for me. \nThanks,\nCatheirne\nOn Nov 8, 2012, at 3:34 PM, Alessandro Morandi wrote:\n\nYes, that's how it's supposed to work: if you provide a screenshots path, screenshots won't be automatically generated (since Baker can't be sure the provided path is writable).\nIt's in a footnote in the wiki page, but I'll reword it to make it a bit more clear.\nI'll also close this issue if that's ok with you :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. \n",

I set \"Target Device Family\" in the active target to \"iPhone/iPad\" but unfortunately still get \"No provisioned IOS devices are available\" ...

Sure, it's 4.2.1 (8C148) on an iPod touch ... but still the same \"No provisioned ...\" You may want to consider providing some test and and a test target?\n. What do you mean by Baker package?\n. I've switched machines, did a fresh xcode 4 install, ran through the provisioning portal stuff, (installing .mobileprovision and .cer ) cloned baker from github, switched device family - but still the same:  please let me know where to send a copy of the whole thing - ! \n. That's what Marco found out, solving my problem:\n\" When I opened the project and check the Baker Target Summary I noticed that for \"Deployment Target\" the value it's a grayed 4.3, which means that no specific target have been selected, so Xcode assume the latest iOS to be the target.\nSince your iPod runs iOS 4.2.1 try to change to set that to 4.2 and that should do the trick: I've just compiled and run the code you send me on my \"iPod from the past\", an old first gen iPod Touch with iOS 3.1.3... well, didn't run very well (crashed almost instantly :P) but it got installed perfectly.\nSo once again before running the app check in the Baker Target Build Settings that the value in the Resolved column is as follow:\n- Architectures                 Standard (armv6 armv7)\n- Base SDK              iOS 4.3\n- Target Device Family      iPhone (or iPhone/iPad)\n- iOS Deployment Target         iOS X.X \n(where X.X is the lowest version of iOS you want to target, Baker support version of iOS from 4.0 to the latest 4.3, should work well even on iOS 3.3 devices)\"\n so it's: find the right switch and indeed - it WORKS !\n.

    "gabalese": "I was wondering if the same rejection criteria apply for italian developers. I downloaded one of the eBook App made with Baker, \"Un post sotto l'albero\", which appears to be 'just a book' according to Apple terms (although beautifully designed).\n. Could well be. But the most intriguing question should be: where should an italian developer sell his iBook, given that iBookstore is not currently active in Italy?\n. Its content varies, quite sure; italian readers have plenty of Project Gutenberg books to choose from :) Since there is no trace of self-publishing or publishing houses on iBookstore IT, I am under the impression that your iBook won't be distributed through iBooks.\n. ",
    "inventionarts": "Apple is definitely pushing book-like apps to the iBookstore. One likely reason for them rejecting this app is that they've introduced \"fixed layout\" eBooks, an extended form of ePub that enables many of the presentation mechanisms afforded by Webkit, including Javascript interactivity, CSS3 animations and effects, and embedded audio and video. (We work with this format.) There are limitations, mostly around the difficulty of managing touch events, as these are commandeered by the iBooks UI. One large difference is an inability to implement any Ajax or indeed any functionality that hits a server: no external connections. \nAt the moment, though I cannot say for sure, the meaningful utilization of external server content or functionality could be the basis for an appeal: you simply cannot implement these in iBooks.\nAt the moment! There's a rev of ePub forthcoming, called ePub 3. It provides for all of the above, and it is anticipated that Apple will support, as they have been reportedly active on the IDPF ePub standards committee that defined this update.\n. Curious to know if the document.webkitHidden state approach was successful in dealing with the original issue. Can experiment if no has as of yet. Thanks!\n. Hi.\nIf I understood the screenshots, they were taken when the page first loaded. Does this update imply that once could run through the pages, thereby generating the screen shots, then recompile a final, shippable version wherein the screenshots are available, with no first-time render? \nPut another way, would part of the release process when using the screenshots be to generate all of them in testing?\nHope the question makes sense. Thanks.\n. Thanks, yes I understood the intent and had read the rendering mode documentation. I asked because it seems related to Issue 122 re webkit animation playing out before being visible by users, and 3 card vs screenshot mode.\nWhat I was trying to ask is if the user will inevitably experience the delay once as the screenshots are generated upon first viewing (which invalidates screenshot as a way to address 122), or if the individual page screenshots can be rendered and saved with the app prior to release so that user never experiences the delay? (Or alternatively simply allow the inclusion of a static loading image per page, pre-rendered offline by the developer, again addressing the preloading of non-looping animation problem).\n. Chiming in here that my colleague Nick's fix worked like a charm. Rock solid performance, zero flashing. We're building a book with numerous full screen animations, games and activities, and lots of audio. Will let you all know when it's up.\nRon\naerbook.com\n. Unfortunately, I don't have the skills to undertake this effort. I do think the release of Kindle Fire will make this meaningful. Will see if. Can figure out some way to move the effort. Thanks again.\n. I was able to using the Friar framework to bring up a test book on the Kindle Fire. Would indeed be great if it was brought up to speed with Baker 3.0. Happy to contribute through testing and commentary, at least. Android development using Eclipse, compared to iOS dev, is another world of complexity and gotchas. Simplifying the process with a cleaner development path is something Baker for Android would really help out with.\n. Jorge, wonderful work on Pookie and Tooshka! Such a rich collection of imagery, music, and activities. Really demonstrating what's possible with Baker and hybrid app development.\n. Barry, a good idea. \nOne suggestion: browse through the various approaches that designers have taken in developing interactive, non-fiction content at NYTimes.com. Not applicable to all categories, but nonetheless may be considered a showcase of patterns and a source of inspiration (but not of outright cribbing, of course!).\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch?query=interactive&more=multimedia,past_365\n. One related suggestion: many such designs can be implemented without much if any hand-coding using Hype, by http://tumultco.com - and dropped pretty much directly into a book.\nWe've found it beneficial to do a fair amount of custom JavaScript, particularly to build \"data-driven\" mini-apps for the page, rather than hardwired, multi-scene Hype presentations. The good news is Hype does support such custom coding, too.\nSimilarly, Sencha Animator offers ways to attach behaviors to images, or to move between scenes within an animation. We have found the animations are smoother using Sencha, as they routinely optimize to take advantage of hardware acceleration, and not clear Hype does this as aggressively.\n. ",

    "tstegart": "Just wanted to add my thanks to both the Laker and Baker folks, this is all awesome. \n. Sooooo.... :) How much do I have to donate to move Newsstand to the top of the list. Don't joke with me, I'm serious :) \n. So Newsstand has a few different elements. One, there is code identifying your App as a Newsstand App. This, along with new icons you make, puts it in Apple's special Newsstand Store and in the Newsstand folder on the user's iPad or iPhone. \nTwo, to be accepted as a Newsstand App, you have to provide for the possibility of downloading multiple issues from within the App. There is a special software kit called Newsstand Kit that you guys at Baker and Laker would need to integrate into the code, which checks for new issues, downloads books or articles in the background and tells the App and the user when it is done.\nHowever, and here is the annoying part, every person who uses Baker would need to have their own server on which to put their issues up so the App can download it. I'm sure that would not be tough in and of itself, but each Baker user would need to go through the Baker code and add in our own server information in the right place, which is pretty complex for newbies and people who don't use XCode every day. So its probably a good idea for you guys as the developers to keep a good handle on what parts will need to be changed and document it well, or you're just going to be facing lots of questions from dorks like me. By the way, the user needs to be able to input issue names, dates and titles as well, so there is quite a bit of information that Baker users will have to enter into the code.\nLastly, and even more annoyingly, if you want to sell your books or magazine issues for money, there are additional requirements, with two aspects. Baker will need to integrate Apple's in-app purchasing software, and the Baker user will need to apply for an Apple certificate to use it. The Baker user then needs to go into the code and put his information in the right place again. This allows iPad/iPhone users to purchase some issues but not others, etc. and re-download old issues and all sorts of fun stuff. \nThere are also push notifications, which alert the user to new issues being available. These are not required, but obviously helpful from a marketing perspective. They also require a certificate from Apple btw.\nSo that's a Newsstand summary. It seems simple from the outset, but once you dig into it its hard. On the other hand, I strongly suggest the Baker developers start work sooner rather than later on it, because I'm guessing Apple will eventually require books and magazines to use it and will start rejecting apps that don't use it. From their perspective, it would be silly to have some magazines in Newsstand and other Magazines floating around the user's iPhone. The only way to get them all in one place will be to start requiring developers to use it, and we know how Apple loves to have things all in one place. \nTom\n. You guys are awesome :)\n. I'm in favor of purchasing, because that's how we plan to make money with our magazine (like most magazines). Without it, you would have to release each issue as a separate App, which Apple is definitely starting to frown upon. So eventually it will be needed unless people using Baker only plan on releasing one book or giving away their stuff for free. I know there are a lot of people that will be doing that so it will come first, but we will be striving to offer subscriptions.\n@mutador  - I've checked out Urban Airship, the problem is with pricing. Lets say you want to sell a magazine, one issue per month and you offer a subscription for $9.99 U.S. dollars, which is reasonable. That means you will be making $7.00 after Apple's cut. In the Free Basic Urban Airship pricing, it costs $.10 per download and $.10 per user per month for subscriptions. So if you add that up it will cost you $1.20 for a user to subscribe to your magazine for a year, and $1.20 to download all 12 issues. Subtract that from $7.00 and you end up with $4.60 for each person that subscribes to your magazine for one year. If you need to pay people for content you need to get a lot of subscribers to make enough money. \nI'm not saying doing it yourself to make the extra $2.40 will be a huge difference, but it is enough to matter when you start figuring out how much we need to pay our writers and for overhead, etc. \n. Dude, that's totally awesome. I love it. It looks as if it's mostly working except for the UI design elements. \n. Dude, that's totally awesome. I love it. It looks as if it's mostly working except for the UI design elements. \n. You're correct mutador. I think what they're trying to say is that they're currently still working on the other parts.\n. While the App Store Approval guidelines don't cover the subject, the iTunes Connect developer guide (Newsstand) states:\n\n\"To submit a Newsstand app, your app must be enabled for Newsstand, offer at least one auto-renewable In-\nApp Purchase subscription, and the Info.plist of the associated binary must include UINewsstandApp=true. In\naddition, UINewsstandIcon must be included in the CFBundleIcons key.\"\n\nThat makes it sound like you need to offer subscriptions (even if they're free) to be a Newsstand app. \n. Can I suggest turning off the Newsstand implementation in the current download of Baker? By that I mean set the UINewsstandApp to \"NO.\" I suggest this because without full Newsstand integration (subscriptions and downloads) your app will always be rejected. So a person downloading Baker to make a book and forgetting to turn it off will be rejected. It is better to have it off right now so anyone using Baker doesn't have to change it before submitting. I know its seems trivial to change but for a lot of newbies its not and will end up tripping them up. \n. I love the shelf guys, great work!\nSome first impressions:\nWhen you're in a book, the button to get back to the Baker shelf says \"Baker Shelf.\" You might want to consider changing this to something more generic, like \"Library.\" Only because end users are not going to know what Baker is, therefore most developers will need to change it, either to eliminate the word Baker or to add in their own name. It seems uneconomical to build into the app something everyone will want to change, and I'm sure you guys will not want to answers questions on how its done every few months, which is probably inevitable. \nYou might want to consider adding in an \"About\" button in the shelf. The shelf currently lacks any way other than books to display information to the user. At least the example I downloaded didn't have one. Is this planned? I'm thinking about privacy policies being the big issue here as something you would like the user to be able to access before they download books. But also contact info, a support email (in case the server is down and none of the books work) and just basic info on how the app works (especially what the consequences of clicking the subscribe button are). Any information that won't change from issue to issue is a good idea to display in the shelf. Are we sure an app will get accepted without this info being available? \nI suggest the about button link to a downloaded book, and if it cannot download it, it uses a bundled book (or uses a json parameter to determine what to do). This way people can design their \"about\" sections to match their magazines look and feel and have a way to give more information.\nQuestions: Can the big baker logo in the shelf be replaced with a logo of any size? Or are there dimension restrictions?\nWhen lots of issues are added, does the shelf paginate itself, or just scroll to show them all. Is it sideways or vertical scrolling?\nSome suggestions for future versions:\nA preview function. A preview button opens up a modal window of a specific size that downloads a preview. It could be the same size on landscape and portrait view to same some coding trouble. If it can download an html file, people can design their own preview pages.\nThats all I have from my initial preview. Its looks great! Thanks to everyone who put in all the hard work.\n. Thanks @folletto!\nI'll start a new issue for the About button, thanks. The preview suggestion was definitely just for the future, I don't want to delay 4.0 :)\nThe background is an image, but does it repeat itself when you have a lot of issues? Do you need to make the background image the same size as however many issues you have, or is it set to fill the full screen, and if you have more issues then it repeats or just ends? \nCan I ask what is left on the to-do list before the shelf is functional to be used to submit an app? I know its not done, but I'm wondering what is left? \nT\n. Awwww yeeaaaahhh!\n. Is this fixed in the latest version of Baker? I just updated to the latest version and I'm getting a white flash between the launch image and our cover image that wasn't there before. I'm also getting a white line down the edge of the page when you scroll left or right (our background is white btw) that wasn't there before either.\n. I also suggest we separate the newsstand work into paid and free, with a stripped down version for people who release free magazines and a full version for people who release paid magazines. A lot of the requirements to accept payments just confuse me, and I know a lot of people just want to get their free magazine into the right place in the App Store, ie Newsstand. \n. That's a pleasant surprise. Is this written down anywhere? I'm a little confused for what the goals are for the next version. Is it support for free magazines in Newsstand out of the box? Maybe we need an update thread. As a non-coder, I find it hard to tell if the shelf version is ready for me to start testing or if there are large parts of the functionality still missing. Can you give a quick update on what is done and what still needs to be done? \n. Thanks @folletto I'll keep an eye on that issue from now on.\n. Ok, fixed.\n. Thanks. So I just put in a URL and I don't actually have to upload anything to the website. If I did want to show author and publisher, what would I upload? \n. I took your previous answer to mean I could upload, say, a text file at that URL with the author and publisher info in it, but I think I'm understanding this wrong. \n. Ok, I understand now. Thanks a lot for explaining that. \n. Thanks. I suspected it might be used on the shelf but I wasn't sure. \n. One last thing, when it is used on the shelf, does it need to be PNG? Can it be JPG? Also, does it have an orientation requirement and size? For example, portrait, 768 x 1024?\n. We may need to reopen this. I couldn't get the index height to work by setting it in the book.json file. It seemed to have no effect and always seemed to show a page way larger than my index page. Setting the size of the content in the HTML seems to be the only way to get it to work.\n. Thanks. \n. I've been using Flurry for analytics and I've just got it working with page views by placing it inside the root view controller.m code. Its still got a few problems, most noticeably that it doesn't count a page view when you open the app, only when you move through the pages after opening. Also, I can't get it to tell me which page was viewed, only that a page was viewed. I've also got it to track outbound links (our magazine is working on getting advertising and need to track clicks) Again, I can track outbound links but not which ones yet. Flurry does have a way of passing information out regarding these things, i just don't know how to implement it. (By the way, the rest of Flurry works fine, I can track users, sessions, countries, etc)\nThe Flurry interface is really great and I'm excited to try work on it more. If I get it to work I will try update the wiki. I know Google analytics also has an iOS SDK that works in a similar way. Maybe we can all try figuring this out as i know it will be important to magazines that wish to use advertising. I would suggest limiting ourselves right now to Flurry and Google, I know they're both popular. (By the way, to avoid confusion, Google has TWO analytics implementations, the web code and the iOS code. The web code does not work inside the app, so you can't just place it in your HTML files [yes, I tried]. The iOS code is placed inside Xcode files and works the same as Flurry. Please be exact so not to confuse people)   \nIf anyone at Baker is interested in this and willing to work with me I would be happy to explain what i know, what the problems are and how they might be fixed. You guys know the code and I'm sure it would go quickly. Maybe we can place comments in the code that will allow people to add it on their own without actually building it into Baker. \nP.S. - This is where I placed the Flurry code for web views in rootviewcontroller.m. You also need to place it in the main thread to enable Flurry.     \n```\n- (BOOL)loadWebView:(UIWebView*)webView withPage:(int)page {\nNSString *path = [NSString stringWithString:[pages objectAtIndex:page - 1]];\nif ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:path]) {\n    NSLog(@\"\u2022 Loading: book/%@\", [[NSFileManager defaultManager] displayNameAtPath:path]);\n\n    // Flurry Analytics page view logging\n    [FlurryAnalytics logPageView];\n\n    // Flurry Analytics event logging for pages\n    [FlurryAnalytics logEvent:@\"Page_Read\"];\n\n    [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:path]]];\n    return YES;\n\n}\nreturn NO;\n\n}\n```\n. What do you mean modular? \nI will try and get anyone interested in this the background on both Flurry and Google so people can look at the documentation and see what the best approach is. We're launching our app this week so I won't have it for you this week, but maybe next week. I will post a also summary of the issues and an approach to solving them. \n. It can. You can fire an event when the user gets to as page, and then fire an event when a user leaves, and then calculate the time of between the event. Its not ideal if you have a TON of events to track, but it will definitely work if you only have a few for now.\n. Ok folks, here's the scoop on analytics. I've collected the information needed to implement Flurry and Google and will try explain it here. I'm afraid I'm not really much of a coder, but maybe we can work through the best way to implement it going forward as I know a lot of professional magazines will need this to work in order to provide a sustainable business modal.\nOverview:\nBoth Google and Flurry provide SDK's for integrating analytics into your code. Google's info page can be found here: http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/mobile/ios.html#howItWorks and Flurry's info page can be found here: http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/GettingStarted/TechnicalQuickStart\nBoth Google and Flurry and other analytics platforms provide similar functionality. They generally:\n- track the number of times the app is opened;\n- try and track the number of users and make guesses about your users;\n- track the length of time your app is opened;\n- allow you to track custom events\n- allow you to track page views\n- send this information to their servers to be dissected and visualized\nThe first three things (tracking number of times you app is used, for how long, and how many users you have) are accomplished automatically when you include the Flurry or Google code in your app. This is done by inserting the code immediately after applicationDidFinishLaunching for both Flurry and Google and following the other simple directions in the Readme file. Flurry and Google collect the information and automatically send it back to be analyzed. This is the the first place Baker needs to accommodate analytics code.\nThe other two common uses of analytics, custom events and page views are more difficult. Both Google and Flurry provide an automatic way to track page views using UIViewController, UINavigationController or UITabBarController.  I don't think Baker uses these and I couldn't get it to work. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. \nHowever, you can track page views another way by calling trackPageView in Google and logPageView in Flurry. These needs to be inserted whenever you want to track a page view. I got this working in a previous version of Baker as described in the code a few posts above this one, but maybe there is a better place. The only important thing to remember is it must only track each page once, and must not track a page view when a user is scrolling through Baker quickly. This is the second place Baker needs to have analytics code.\nThe third thing, custom even tracking, appears the most difficult. However, its is vitally important to commercial magazines that need to track page views of advertisements and outbound links. The problem with the page view code above is that it tracks a page view, not WHICH page was viewed. Both Google and Flurry allow you to custom track events though, so this should be possible in Baker somehow. \nThis is how Flurry describes its event tracking capabilities:\n[FlurryAnalytics logEvent:@\"EVENT_NAME\"];\nUse logEvent to count the number of times certain events happen during a session of your application. This can be useful for measuring how often users perform various actions, for example. Your application is currently limited to counting occurrences for 300 different event ids (maximum length 255 characters).\n[FlurryAnalytics logEvent:@\"EVENT_NAME\" withParameters:YOUR_NSDictionary];\nUse this version of logEvent to count the number of times certain events happen during a session of your application and to pass dynamic parameters to be recorded with that event. Event parameters can be passed in as a NSDictionary object where the key and value objects must be NSString objects. For example, you could record that a user used your search box tool and also dynamically record which search terms the user entered. Your application is currently limited to counting occurrences for 100 different event ids (maximum length 255 characters). Maximum of 10 event parameters per event is supported.\nAn example NSDictionary to use with this method could be:\nNSDictionary *dictionary =\n[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@\"your dynamic parameter value\",\n@\"your dynamic parameter name\",\nnil];\n[FlurryAnalytics logEvent:@\"EVENT_NAME\" timed:YES];\nUse this version of logEvent to start timed event.\n[FlurryAnalytics logEvent:@\"EVENT_NAME\" withParameters:YOUR_NSDictionary timed:YES];\nUse this version of logEvent to start timed event with event parameters.\n[FlurryAnalytics endTimedEvent:@\"EVENT_NAME\" withParameters:YOUR_NSDictionary];\nUse endTimedEvent to end timed event before app exists, otherwise timed events automatically end when app exists. When ending the timed event, a new event parameters NSDictionary object can be used to update event parameters. To keep event parameters the same, pass in nil for the event parameters NSDictionary object. \n\nPresumeably, Google might work the same way. We would need to figure out how to pass to Flurry and Google the URI of the page that is being viewed and also which URI is clicked on for link tracking.\nIn my opinion, tracking the names of pages viewed, how long they were viewed and outbound links are the most important data to be tracked for advertisement supported magazines. Of these, tracking the names of the pages viewed and outbound links are far more important than the time spent on each page. This should be the third place Baker needs to accommodate analytics code.\nI have not gotten this to work yet and I don't know where in Baker to place the code. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.\nIn conclusion, I think the analytics roadmap should look as follows:\n1. Identify proper places in Baker to add all analytics code. \n2. Add in analytics code in Baker, test on Flurry and Google.\n3. Decide how to make code modular, so that analytics code can be removed from versions of Baker that don't use it.\n4. Test modular code.\nIf anyone has questions or comments or would like to further revise how we should approach this, please post a comment. If you have time, energy, and know how to work on this, please also post. If the Baker folks would like to weigh in on if they think this important enough to spend time on themselves, that would be great too. \nTom\n. Localytics seems to use the same system, with code needed after applicationDidFinishLaunching and it looks like it also needs NSDictionary events. Take a look at their documentation under \"events\" here:  http://www.localytics.com/docs/iphone-integration/\nI'm guessing most of the analytics programs out there work the same way. \n. Hey Baker guys,\nIs there any way to pass the referrer on to an external website linked to from inside the Baker app? This would help tracking links and clicks on the advertiser's end (or internally, if you're linking to your own website)\n. I mean passing the referrer to the web server serving the page. In the Baker wiki it says this: \n\"NOTE: the parameter is used in Baker and will not be used in the URL to contact the server. In the example above the server will receive only http://www.external-site.com.\"\nIs it possible for the server to receive the parameter? That way a website can track how many times people visited them from inside a Baker app by using their own internal analytics to track the referrer. \n. Hey everyone. I'm having trouble placing my analytics code, and I was wondering if anyone could help. I'm trying to count pageviews by placing my analytics code to count every time an internal (or external) page is loaded. Previously, as I mentioned in a post above, I placed the code after: \n```\n- (BOOL)loadWebView:(UIWebView*)webView withPage:(int)page {\nNSString *path = [NSString stringWithString:[pages objectAtIndex:page - 1]];\nif ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:path]) {\n    NSLog(@\"\u2022 Loading: book/%@\", [[NSFileManager defaultManager] displayNameAtPath:path]);\n\n\\\\ I placed my code here..\n```\nWith the new Baker modal view, everything has been moved around and I'm not really sure how to count page views anymore. I can't seem to figure out when the actual page is loaded, both for internal pages, mail links and external pages that open modal view. Any help would be appreciated. \n. Thanks! I'm trying it and I'll let you know how it works after I get my analytics data back. \n. Congratulations! I hope it does well.\n. Thanks. I might write a wiki entry on this to help people out. We're launching this week so it will have to wait a week or two. By the way, some sites suggest that because the pixel ratio is just double, the best way to handle this is to only include the retina image in your app and then scale down the image by 50% for the non-retina iPads. Do you agree?\n. When I wrote the original post I was really thinking only about images, and now I've put some more thought in I'm starting to get worried about text too. I just realized, if our magazine uses the same css file as the Baker example app which sets the main column of text to a certain width (about 540 I think), does that mean it will display at that width on the new iPad? Somehow I expected it to double automatically, but now I wonder. A 540 px width on a retina display will be very small, the columns will be too skinny. Will the whole CSS file have to be redone?\n. Ok, whew! We're a few days from launch and that was starting to freak me out. :)\n. Awesome! Thanks a lot guys. \n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, one more question related this topic. When we use @font face to import fonts in our CSS like in Laker, does web view actually use all those fonts? Or can we delete some of the ones used for IE? Do you know which one we actually need?\n. Ah, ok. I used the tool suggested in Laker, the font-face generator from Font Squirrel. It gives you CSS that ends up like this example:\nsrc: url('../fonts/oswald/oswald-webfont.eot');\n    src: url('../fonts/oswald/oswald-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('eot'), url('../fonts/oswald/oswald-webfont.woff') format('woff'), url('../fonts/oswald/oswald-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'), url('../fonts/oswald/oswald-webfont.svg#webfont1Pz3m7lF') format('svg');\nI think I can delete some of those because Laker is made to work on the web as well and I don't need that inside Baker. \n. It is enough, thanks. I can confirm thats the only one you need. \n. Thanks. Can they be deleted if we don't want them? I can see where to change the color in book.json (which I could just change to match the background color if I want them invisible), but where can I delete them? \n. Thanks!\n. Sorry to reopen this, but is there a way to not show the page number but still show the page title? When I make the numbers invisible by changing their color to the background color the titles also disappear. I can't find a place to change just the numbers color. \n. Ok, thanks :)\n. Thanks for the quick response guys! As a note, I've read a few other blogs and most people seem to think this will get fixed soon. For now, can I just break up my images and put them back together again using CSS? Its sounds like that should work as the bug is with individual image sizes. \n. Awesome. Thanks.\nT\n. Ah, ok, thanks. \n. I've never spent 5 hours chasing down a bug before. I suppose there is always a first time. I literally did everything I could until I finally went through the offending HTML page line by line deleting stuff until it stopped. At least we now know what error message comes up (well, it might also come up for other reasons, but at least people have a starting place).\n. This error came up a few more times for me while I was getting our app ready. Although it was not always clear what was causing it, it always related to something in the HTML. I'm closing the issue as it doesn't seem to have anything to do with Baker specifically, but for others who get the same error, be sure to check your code even if it looks correct. A good way to isolate it is to delete pages from your book.json file until Baker starts working.\nBaker guys, is there a better way to isolate the problem page? Can Baker specify which page is causing the error? This took me forever to track down because I couldn't figure out which page was causing it. \n. I will check and see if I have any copies of some old HTML that was causing it and will try and post it to see if it breaks for anyone else. \n. This is an Xcode bug, so I've closed the issue. You have to control-click on the very tiny outside part of the missing icon image, outside the dotted line. Clicking inside the dotted line does nothing. Very silly. \n. Congratulations! Maybe you can talk to the Baker guys about how you implemented newsstand. Its on the list.\n. As an update, this happens on random links, as far as I can tell. Usually more often when I don't let the page the link is going to fully load and try to go back right away. \n. Thanks. Its a really nice feature, I love it. I had to go back to opening things in Safari for our release today but I'd love to see this all ironed out, it makes for a really smooth app experience. \n. I will, thanks!\n. Everything seems to work great, thanks!\n. @Xm4s  I'm using the new code and the \"open in Safari\" button in the upper right of the modal view only starts working after the page has finished loading. Not sure if this is on purpose or not. If you hit it before the website loading in modal view is finished then your tap has no effect. \n. I don't think this is possible just yet with just javascript. Maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong. See https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/350\n. Holy cows that is AWESOME. Does it work across books? For example, can I have one bookmark page and a user can see all the articles they have bookmarked across all the issues they have ever read? Would there be a way to dim the bookmarks that are in issues not currently on the device? \n. The links to download the code are on the main page (https://github.com/Simbul/baker) right underneath the link to Baker's website. Look for the big \"ZIP\" button. \n. @folletto Have you gotten this to work on a non-retina iPad with a full screen image? Just wondered if you had tested it. No matter which way I try to do it, adding a full screen retina image results in about a 5 second delay in loading the page and slows our app down considerably. We have an iPad 1 for testing, but it also delays loading in the retina display simulator. Let me know if you have gotten it to work.\n. I was trying to use only one image and scaling it down, not serving two different images depending on the device. I was going off the advice in this thread (answer 2): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7733223/serving-non-retina-and-retina-displays-with-one-code-base-framework-for-scaling\nBut now that I look at it I think I might have a problem in the meta tags because in the log in Xcode it just pauses and then sets the height of the viewport, which it doesn't seem to do with without my retina test images. \nHere is the code basics:\nEdit: I can't get this to display as code in my comment, how do I fix that?\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Title goes here</title>\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=768; initial-scale=1.0;\"/>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/book.css\">\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"page\" class=\"chapter\">\n     <img src=\"images/test-images/retina-test-1.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" align=\"top\" class=\"starter\"/>        \n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n. Has this been added to Baker? I'm still getting a timeout. If not, does the code above still work? @davidrsim, can you explain where you added your code exactly? \n. Thanks. Yeah, I noticed all the work on the code the last week, it looks great! Hopefully @davidrsim can chime in with where he placed his code. \n. Thanks @davidrsim. I tried it, but I'm getting an error on this line:\n[[self delegate] done:self]; - Instance method '-done' not found (return type defaults to \"id\")\n. It compiles, but throws an error when I turn off wi-fi on the iPad and try and test it.\n-[RootViewController done:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1be260\n2012-07-16 19:02:37.693 ONB Magazine[2260:707] * Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[RootViewController done:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1be260'\n* First throw call stack:\n(0x3603488f 0x37289259 0x36037a9b 0x36036915 0x35f91650 0x23cd9 0x30cebd3d 0x30d45f2d 0x30d74de7 0x30da5761 0x30d43d77 0x30d43bfb 0x30cbec53 0x30cc457d 0x37da5c2f 0x36e2ce91 0x360072ad 0x35f8a4a5 0x35f8a36d 0x3234a439 0x30cd7e7d 0x228f 0x2240)\nterminate called throwing an exception(lldb)\n. I could't get the code above to work for me, so I snooped on the internet and found this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9094830/testing-internet-connection-on-ipad-app-using-ios5\nI added the example code to ModalViewController.m around line 188 just after webViewDidStartLoad. I then added in@davidrsim's warning code and tweaked the message a little. It seems to work just fine, although it could be improved. After you click on \"OK,\" you're still stuck in modal view with a blank page and the spinner is still spinning. Adding another button to the warning to \"Go Back\" might be useful to take people back to the book page they were viewing before they opened modal view. Maybe this can be added to the next version of Baker.\nCode below:\n```\n- (void)webView:(UIWebView )webView didFailLoadWithError:(NSError )error {\n    if (![[error domain] isEqualToString:NSURLErrorDomain]) {\n        return;\n    }\n// Show warning to user that device is not connected\nNSLog(@\"Not connected\");\nUIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:nil message:@\"The page you are trying to reach is unavailable - you don't seem to be connected to the internet right now.\" \n                                               delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil];\n[alert show];\n[alert release];\n\n}\n```\n. We decided to use Amazon S3, and the set-up was pretty easy. I had a Baker book download up and running in about an hour. You can get a free usage tier for a year, and then the cost is relatively low after that. http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\n. Thanks. If we end up hiring someone to do it (I don't know how to code) we'll release it, otherwise you might want to add it to the feature list. It has advantages of saving users time by not having to download a new book and also by not having to be near an internet connection and will save devs money by not having to pay for the extra bandwidth. A magazine could include two or three popular issues in one app and others could be downloaded later, thereby putting much of the download costs onto Apple.\nP.S. How many hours work would you estimate it would take to do this?\n. Thanks. There isn't a way to trick Baker into thinking it is downloading a book but really it would be unzipping a file from within the book folder itself? \n. I was thinking... can the index view be reloaded to a different file? Its a shortcut to getting what we want, but it will help if we can change the content in the index view to pretend to show different table of contents for each magazine issue. \n. Thanks! And thanks for the advice on the Open_Book_Message too, I've got it fixed. \n. No, sorry, we were getting a release out the door. I'll try it again with the master and get back to you guys. \n. We've had it full screen videos turn black happen on an iPad 1. I haven't been able to narrow it down enough to open an issue on it because it seems random. I can't reproduce it. \n. Thanks! \n. @folletto Does Baker support a URL schemes? I can't quite figure out how they work exactly, but should it be possible to have a user click on a link on our website and a specific story opens up in our magazine? That seems like it would be useful. Maybe I need to learn more and write up a little how-to. \n. Yes, the github master.

Hmm... I only get the Xcode warning in the Master version. I've done cleans, so the only thing left is Flurry analytics, which I added to the master. Not usually a show stopper, but I'll try again with a clean version.\n. It must be Flurry. The problem persists when I delete it my code, but a clean version of the master seems to work. I'm not sure how I introduced that bug, but my apologies. \n. Here is a sample book with the video: https://s3.amazonaws.com/ONB-public-files/book.zip\nIt doesn't work for me in the latest versions of Baker, only previous versions. If you need an older version of Baker, just let me know. Also, I'm on an iPad 1. Might that have something to do with it?\n. I could never get the video to work in the new version of Baker, so I switched to using the HTML video tag instead of a javascript player. You can close this issue as tracking down why the video worked in one version but not the other is probably a wild goose chase. \nI did break my focus and blur video controls though, so if anyone is currently using video with the HTML video tag and wants to share their code to pause the video when the user moves off the page and to restart it when they move back, I will appreciate it.\n. Try looking into Parse (https://www.parse.com/plans). It appears you can host your issues (if they're under 1GB) and get 1,000,000 downloads for free. Might need a little extra work to get it working though. \n. We will be trying to test this in the next few days, so I'll start a new thread with any issues we have. Thanks for all the hard work everyone, it looks great. I have to say, Apple's documentation on this is a mess, the free subscriptions and paid are all intermingled and the terminology changes from document to document. If I get it working, I'll try write up the process.\n. Ca I ask what people are using for screenshots? Its a little difficult to take a screenshot of an in-app purchase you can't take a picture of until the in-app purchase has been created. Seems circular.\n. Thanks. I'm just not sure what to take a picture of. In-app purchases need to be approved by Apple and they want a screenshot. I guess I'll just submit a picture of the Baker shelf. Anyone else got their IAP approved yet? How long did it take?\n. Yes, it needs to be 5.0 or above. Does anyone know if it needs to be higher than that? Did you guys use any 6.0-only features? It would be nice if 5.0 was still available as that makes iPad 1 an option. \n. No, I think you're right. It should probably be changed to 5.0 otherwise it will be rejected from the app store. The Baker shelf version probably still uses 4.3, but I would argue we should set the default at 5.0 and let those that wish to support the lower OS set it on their own. \n. When I open the Baker master in Xcode it still shows up with a deployment target of 4.3. \n. Another quirk: If you have an issue specified in the json file on the server but there isn't a file actually there to download, Baker just hangs and attempts to download it continuously (well, for a minute so far). Is there a timeout set? There should be an error message if there is no book to download. \n. Thanks! Will do. \n. Thanks! That makes things pretty easy.\n. I think we can probably close this. I'll add a line to the Wiki to let people know where to change things. \n. I added a line to the Wiki about where to change things under optional customization. The solution mentioned above seems to be a nice way to customize all of the strings at once and I believe it is optimal. \n. It could have something to do with this: http://dhilipsiva.blogspot.com/2012/07/ios-6-ui-interface-orientation.html\n. Yes. I'm pretty sure I've found all the ways I can see to limit the orientation, but maybe I still have something wrong. Can anyone else get it limited to portrait? \n. Thanks! Can I ask if anyone knows what the app should do when a user subscribes correctly? Is there a pop-up, a confirmation message, some kind of user notification?\n. Is there an unsubscribe button? Not that anyone would want to do such a thing with my magazine of course, but, you know, for others.. :)\n. Nevermind, I believe subscriptions are handled from within iTunes. EDIT: We might want to tell the user this with a pop-up after subscribing. Its not commonly known. \n. You're right, I don't think anybody knows. Actually, I'm not even sure what a free subscription does, and I have a magazine. Even though we have to offer it to get accepted, does it actually do anything? I mean, what is the free subscription code actually doing in the background, does anyone know? Sigh, Apple kills me sometimes. \n. Hmmm.. I thought @darren2c57's version was right. I thought push notifications was just the message you could send to users notifying them of a new issue (and having a little badge show up on the corner of your icon), but Newsstand actually did the downloading of the new issue in the background by itself without any push notification. Sigh. Apple really needs better documentation. \n. So if we don't send push notifications, is the user notified in any way. How do they get a new issue, just by hitting refresh? What the heck does hitting the subscribe button do then?\n. ",

I already converted it to epub via smashwords but sales are low and version control is not good enough. An app allows so much more functions.\n. Smart move :) Thank you!\nMove complete. No errors. I get a the loading screen, but after that only black. Looking for what is wrong...\n-Update: Baker to Laker or Laker to Baker, both are unsuccessful. If I can't crack it I think I have no choice but to give up and wait for an update to Laker. No problem, I can live with the great result that it already gives and enjoy any future update.\nIf I somehow get it working I'll post that here.\n. I finished conversion from Laker 1.1 to Baker 3.0.2 as guided by Folletto (tnx!!) and can confirm that it is totally worth the effort of your trouble. The main advantage to me is the fact that it loads quicker and that there now is an option to allow the pages of the previous and the next dossiers to pre-load. This greatly increases the feel of speed.\nFor the future my most anticipated feature will be in-app purchases, I hope that will arrive soon.\n. ",

For example, an onLoad event that redirects to the first page of the chapter.\n. Try this code: http://davidwalsh.name/detect-iphone\n.

    "anjimi": "I'm working on my first Baker project. Great stuff. I have one major issue which is similar to the problem discussed here and on https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/89.\nI'm experiencing a problem when testing on the iPad with incorrect sizing of pages when changing orientation. I am only getting the problem when changing from landscape to portrait. I am using css media queries. Sometimes when changing from landscape to portrait the size is set too large for the portrait view. I am using three-cards rendering and sometimes this incorrect sizing can persist to the pages either side of current page, not always though. Once you swipe between 2+ pages on portrait orientation the sizing corrects itself. \nI tried searching in RootViewController.m for the code mentioned above but all the orientation references appear different. As this is a fairly old issue could the orientation parts have been rewritten since?\nIs there another fix for this orientation/sizing problem?\n. I managed to sort out the problem I was having with pages being sized too large for the viewport when changing from landscape to portrait orientation.\nI had removed the viewport declaration which was fixed to width=768 when I started on my app, to allow portrait and landscape views.\nJust in case anyone else has this problem, the following viewport declaration has fixed the orientation/sizing issue (and also disables pinch and zoom, which was desirable in our app):\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0\" />\n. Hi all, I'm just catching up with where the Newsstand stuff is up to. I've been busy working on content for our magazine app which I've been testing with Baker 3.2. I'd like to try using the shelf branch now and have just downloaded the latest files from the shelf branch. Are there any instructions on how to implement and test the shelf with multiple issues? Would the first issue of our magazine be included in the books folder of our app or do I need to implement downloading of the first issue, and then subsequent issues after that?\nI apologise if this information is already to be found somewhere, but I can only find mention of part of the process, and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n. Thanks Davide, I had seen this page but it doesn't offer any instruction on how to implement issue downloads. I saw a comment on https://github.com/Simbul/baker/issues/522 which mentions hosting a .json file on your own website, but I can't find anything further on implementation of this, and where this is referenced in the shelf app.\n. Great! Thank you for that, I'll try that today.\n. Apple developer guidelines table says for Default Newsstand cover images: At least 512 pixels on the longest edge / At least 1024 pixels on the longest edge (for high-resolution iPhone 4/iPad displays). So I'm guessing we would need one cover image per issue at least 1024 pixels long and it should then be scaled appropriately in Newsstand and on the Baker shelf?\n. @manyakabi the 'double page spread' effect could be achieved if you make your pages so you have left and right page in one html file and use css media queries to make both 'sides' of the page fit on horizontal orientation and scroll across left-to-right on portrait orientation.\n. Thanks, I have been using clean build each time I run the app, as per the Baker tutorial instructed.\nI have some screenshots of the issue, where should I send them?\n. I have emailed some screenshots. I set the pages to have solid backgrounds in different shades of grey. Usually there are full-page background images on each page. I saved some first without removing the images but they were obviously quite large ;)\nI found the size much quicker to correct itself without the images, it is less of an issue without the images! It was actually quite hard to capture the screen shots, the ones I managed to catch are in mid-rotate.\nI sent 9 shots in total, 3 each for 3 different pages. So first image for each page shows portrait view, second shows the cropping issue, third shows correct landscape view.\nJust so you know, with the background images I'm using one image for both portrait and landscape backgrounds, so it's not having to load a new image on orientation. My background image file sizes average 200-400k each.\n. Thanks Xm4s!\n\u2022 I had thought to try reducing the image size after seeing how much quicker it was to correct without them.\n\u2022 I've tried using screenshot mode but was getting a flicker on page change.\n\u2022 I'm already using three-cards mode.\nNo problem, I understand. I will play with the image sizes and will keep an eye out for Baker updates....\n. To follow up on this issue:\nI tried reducing the size of my background images, but to make any significant difference to the file size there was too much loss of image quality and it made no apparent difference to the speed of the 'cropping' correction.\nI discovered screenshot mode does fix the 'cropping' issue when changing portrait to landscape orientation :)\n... But there is another issue with a fade/flicker glitch on page change in screenshot mode - screenshot is loaded first on page change, which then fades to black (which is my background colour) before then loading the page itself. This happens quickly but is noticeable and unacceptable for us - is this a known bug?\nI tried screenshot mode with pre-rendered screenshots included and screenshots folder referenced in book.json, but still get the flicker problem on page change.\nI have now made all the pre-rendered screenshots solid black (same colour as my background colour) which means the fade/flicker glitch on page change is effectively invisible. It does mean the pages appear to take slightly longer to load, but of course with a solid black image for each screenshot these have very small file-size so at least they load quickly.\nThis seems to be the best compromise right now.\n. Hi, is that the fade/flicker glitch you are referring to? I'm not sure of the best way to describe it to apple, how to reference UIWebView, could you offer any advice on describing the problem correctly so I can submit a bug report to apple. Thank you :)\n. Ok, thanks. I was meaning, I don't know how the screenshots mode works - how to describe the process of loading the screenshot, then the page content. Should I describe how the issue occurs relative to baker, or should it be described relative to UIWebView?\n. Hi, sorry, I'm confused. I only see the flash of colour when in screenshots mode, so what triggers it - if it's not loading the screenshot and then the content?\n. Thanks Davide, where would I find this function? \nSorry, I'm not familiar with Xcode or Objective-C, just learning :)\n. Great - I'll take a look and thank you for the info and help :)\n. Cool, that was really easy :)\nSo normally the corners are not active for any tap area.\nI have changed from this:\n```\n- (void)setTappableAreaSize {\nNSLog(@\"\u2022 Set tappable area size\");\nint tappableAreaSize = screenBounds.size.width/16;\nif (screenBounds.size.width < 768) {\n    tappableAreaSize = screenBounds.size.width/8;\n}\nupTapArea    = CGRectMake(tappableAreaSize, 0, pageWidth - (tappableAreaSize * 2), tappableAreaSize);\ndownTapArea  = CGRectMake(tappableAreaSize, pageHeight - tappableAreaSize, pageWidth - (tappableAreaSize * 2), tappableAreaSize);\nleftTapArea  = CGRectMake(0, tappableAreaSize, tappableAreaSize, pageHeight - (tappableAreaSize * 2));\nrightTapArea = CGRectMake(pageWidth - tappableAreaSize, tappableAreaSize, tappableAreaSize, pageHeight - (tappableAreaSize * 2));\n}\n```\nto this:\n```\n- (void)setTappableAreaSize {\nNSLog(@\"\u2022 Set tappable area size\");\nint tappableAreaSize = screenBounds.size.width/16;\nif (screenBounds.size.width < 768) {\n    tappableAreaSize = screenBounds.size.width/8;\n}\nupTapArea    = CGRectMake(0, 0, pageWidth, tappableAreaSize);\ndownTapArea  = CGRectMake(0, pageHeight - tappableAreaSize, pageWidth, tappableAreaSize);\nleftTapArea  = CGRectMake(0, tappableAreaSize, tappableAreaSize, pageHeight - (tappableAreaSize * 2));\nrightTapArea = CGRectMake(pageWidth - tappableAreaSize, tappableAreaSize, tappableAreaSize, pageHeight - (tappableAreaSize * 2));\n}\n```\nso my top/bottom tap areas are now full width and my icon in the corner is now tappable :)\nI would think a page-down icon in bottom corner could be a common desirable, and seems a waste that corners are normally not active at all, maybe worth changing this as standard in Baker?\n(sorry, still trying to figure out commenting ;)\n. Ah, ok fair enough :)\n. Hi Davide, yes sorry, I thought I had explained in the second paragraph, each HTML file or 'page' has content which scrolls vertically. As mentioned I have \"-baker-vertical-pagination\" in book.json set to true so each page behaves like it has multiple vertical 'pages'. I have css rules to adapt the layout so it works for both portrait and landscape orientation.\nOn orientation change the display view does not always show the section of the page which was visible before re-orientation, as I described.\n. Hi, thanks. Sorry I think I still need to explain, when I say first and last page I mean first (top) and last (bottom) vertical page section within one html page. It behaves the same all the time, on all html pages regardless of content.\nI'll refer to an html page as 'file' and a vertical page section within a 'page' as 'vertical-page'.\nSo, for example, if I am viewing a file on portrait view, I'm at the top of the file, flip to landscape orientation and I can still see the top vertical-page. Flip back and once again I can still see the same vertical-page. All good.\nIf I swipe or tap down to another vertical-page, flip to landscape and I see a cropped part of a vertical-page, not necessarily the vertical-page I was on before turning the iPad. Same for all vertical-pages within one file.\nI just figured out the cause of this:\nOn orientation change the vertical position is set to the same vertical position as it was before rotating. In my case because the responsive css rules have already re-sized the content height, it means the vertical-page top positions are now different.\nI just tried adding some js which works out how your vertical-page position and changes the scrollTop, but it's very slow to catch up after orientation change. The adaptive css rules update the layout before you have even finished rotating.\nNot sure where to go from here...\n. No, not yet. I have been distracted with getting content into my app.\nI am planning to try a different fix using JS to change the CSS for the content height of 'vertical page sections' and the scrollTop after reorientation. Bit hacky but I think it may be a better solution than just using JS to fix the scrollTop, as the JS does't run until after reorientation, whereas the CSS rules update much quicker.\n. Thank you, the page on the subscription pingback is useful, and its relevant links to the apple developer site, which I will read up on. I'm now guessing that PRODUCT_ID_FREE_SUBSCRIPTION may relate to the subscription id in iTunes Connect?\nI'll download the latest baker master and check that out.\nI see now how the baker wiki is organised, sorry I'm still familiarising myself with everything here :)\n. Our timeframe fits in with the 4.0 release, so may be able to help with testing/approval. Our publication is almost ready. I need to test with latest master baker and look at Apple setup.\nNew wiki tutorial is great, thank you so much for this. :)\n. Just found this on Apple Newsstand FAQ: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2280/_index.html\n\nIs my Newsstand app required to use Newsstand Kit's background downloading feature?\nIf you're delivering an issue to a user as part of a subscription, you must deliver it via background download.\nIn general, users will expect Newsstand apps to have content downloaded in the background, ready and available for offline viewing. If a user hasn't purchased a subscription for new issues, you may use Newsstand Kit's background downloading feature to deliver other content. Keep in mind that your Newsstand app should not deliver or manage content in a way that ends up consuming large amounts available storage space on a user's device.\n\nThis would suggest that push notifications for background download are required for Newsstand apps.\n. I'm actually having the opposite problem, but could be related...\nMy app which is set up for both portrait and landscape, has always worked in both orientations until I updated from Xcode 4.3.2 to 4.5.2 recently. Only loads portrait in iOS 6, on both iPad and iPhone simulators, and on an actual iPhone with iOS 6. Still works fine portrait and landscape in iOS 5.1.\nNote, this is using Baker 3.2, I've not got to testing the shelf yet, hopefully soon!\n. ",

However, we have a few requirements that would require some changes to this format in order to meet our needs.

Having this information exist solely in the file (say via <meta>) isn't an option since we cannot fetch every file in the array for performance reasons.\nMy proposal is to modify the pages array you have here to support objects as well as strings, meaning the following example would be valid:\njs\n\"pages\": [\n  {\n    \"url\": \"Part1.html\",\n    \"title\": \"Part One\",\n    \"author\": \"John Example\",\n    \"my_custom_field\": \"Custom value\"\n  },\n  \"Part2.html\"\n]\nFrom a code standpoint, it is a matter of checking the type of each entry in the array.\nRelated: Treesaver supports sectioning/nested articles. This is something we do via a property within the article object, which can be ignored by clients that do not support it.\nSupport publication-wide custom metadata\nMuch as we allow authors to provide custom values per article, we'd also like to enable doing this across a publication. I suggest allowing these at the top level of the object, as peers to title, etc. So for example:\n``` js\n{\n  \"title\": \"My Title\",\n  \"author\": \"John Example\",\n  \"creator\": \"...\",\n  // etc\n\"my_custom_field\": \"Custom value\",\n  \"my_custom_field2\": [\"value_1\", \"value_2\"],\n// Properties, pages, etc\n}\n```\nNote that this data is not Treesaver-specific, rather it is metadata about the publication itself.\nAlternatively, these custom fields could live within a separate object, but our preference is to have them top-level for simplicity. This also make extensibility and future proofing a bit easier, and follows the conventions of package.json, which allow for arbitrary field addition as well.\nRenaming the pages array\nThis is a minor point, but I believe the term pages is a bit overloaded. When creating a paginated layout, a single \"web page\" can be split into several \"pages\" (screens?), and the terms can get a little confusing (e.g. page 3 of foo.html). I'm wondering if a different name could be used, perhaps contents, parts, toc, or articles?\nproperties vs. x-baker, x-treesaver, etc\nI'm not quite sure I understand the separation between the properties object and user-agent specific settings. The example above has pinchToZoom and orientation within the properties object, while background and verticalBounce exist within the x-baker object. It seems like orientation, etc are fairly tablet-specific, while background seems quite general (indexHeight seems perfect for x-baker though).\nBorrowing inspiration from CSS, what if we merged into a settings object, and prefixed properties which are user-agent specific:\njs\n\"settings\": {\n  \"background\": \"#000000\",\n  \"-baker-indexHeight\": 150,\n  // Etc\n}\nI really like the work you've done so far, and I hope we can get to a common format here. Thanks!\n. Moving these out of order for better flow:\nRenaming Array\nI have a preference for contents over content since it is an array with multiple items, and content gives a slight feeling of being the text content of the book.\nObjects in Pages\nGlad you're OK with this, since it is definitely key for our scenarios. As for the required fields within, I consider url the only required field (maps neatly to using just a string). The other fields can be recommended and widely-recognized, but otherwise it's up to the author to determine what can go in there (this dovetails into the next point):\nRe: Custom Metadata\nThe metadata in this case isn't user-agent specific, but rather it is metadata for the content. The thinking for this custom metadata (be it at the root level or within an individual article) is that it is extra information provided by the author of the content / end developer -- not by tools or by reader software. So imagine someone wishes to add a license property, or perhaps they wish to add a permalink property, which points to a web-accessible URL for an article (or even a shortlink). \nThere are a few parallels here in terms of other formats -- I mentioned package.json, which has the notion of required and optional fields, along with the ability to add custom fields to the object as well. This works pretty well for ad-hoc extensibility and some level of futureproofing (new fields that are added later do not make the manifest file invalid for older versions).\nAnother example is with HTML -- new tags are simply ignored if they are unknown. <meta> and <link> tags work in a similar way in terms of being informal and somewhat freeform.\nAlthough there are many scenarios in which this extra metadata may be picked up and interpreted by a user-agent, the idea is that they are not specific to any particular user-agent and can be safely ignored (in that sense they are similar to properties, although the difference is that they are still data). The notion of a twitter-friendly URL for a piece of content can be very handy for applications, but it's not specific to any one renderer.\nRegardless, I do completely understand your point here. Let me propose three options as I see them:\n1. Freeform, top level: The model I was explaining above. Simplest for authors to implement (no prefixes or extra objects). However, there will be more heterogeneity between book.json files in the wild, potentially leading to confusion.\n2. Prefixed, top level: Similar to above, but non-spec properties receive a prefix, perhaps something like data-propname used in HTML5 or CSS vendor-style prefixes like -baker-propname\n3. Dedicated object: All author custom, user-agent specific, or otherwise non-standard properties go into one or more dedicated objects for storage. Likely the most futureproof, possibly cleaner in terms of implementation.\nDid I miss any option? As is obvious, I have a preference toward 1 and 2. However, this all ties in somewhat into the final item.\nProperties vs. x-baker\n\nSo orientation and pinchToZoom are in this perspective properties of the book and the rendering engine should read these and adapt accordingly. Instead, the extensions are add-ons, out of the standard, so a book might not use them at all. While not specifying the orientation is a problem, because all the tablets out there can manage that, ignoring \"background\" is just something that affect the specific \"Baker\" rendering engine, and another reader, for example Treesaver, can safely ignore them\n\nThis is the tricky part -- one man's universal, inherent property is another's optional add-on :) For a tablet-only (iPad-only?) project such as Baker, pinchToZoom and orientation are seen as first-class aspects of a publication. However, these aspects aren't universal once you move to laptops, TVs, etc.\nAgain, I can see both sides of the argument, I just have a preference toward the flatter model (prefix or not), for these reasons:\n- Fewer distinct objects means less typing and structure\n- Easier to document/teach authors to create the file, since there are fewer buckets where properties can go (i.e. don't have to think whether background goes in properties or x-baker?)\n- Has parallels to HTML/CSS\nBut of course, I know there are disadvantages as well -- which is why this is a preference :)\nBonus: Hierarchy\nOur scenarios require hierarchy for the content of the publication, for example a newspaper has sections for Fashion, Sports, etc. I see that you have some requests for supporting multiple HPubs, so perhaps there will be some parallels for you as well.\n@BramStein and I have talked about a few options, but one that is interesting is to simply allow full nesting within a contents item -- meaning each article could have roughly the same properties as the root publication, including a contents array. Obviously though, there are some tricky aspects here -- but something worth talking about at least.\nIf hierarchy isn't something Baker is planning on doing any time soon, then we'll need to have our own method, based on whichever extensibility option we choose :)\n. On a different note, I'm curious why you chose for creator to be a single string instead of an array. Multiple authors is something that happens frequently, and unless you prescribe a strict standard (comma after every name, etc), then extracting authors could get tricky. Perhaps this is another case where one can either use a plain string, or choose to use an array.\nPackage.json uses an array w/ hashes for various properties in this case (to hold web links, twitter, etc). That may be overkill here, depending on how you see those fields being used.\n. I think we're getting close here, but I realize that I should clarify something from Treesaver's part (so you can better understand my viewpoint). There are very few things in the JSON that Treesaver will natively use. Specifically, many scenarios will likely only use the contents array, and just as a way to string articles together in a specific order. Treesaver-specific settings may get a decent amount of use as well, although that hasn't be exposed quite yet so time will tell.\nAll other metadata, be it at the top-level or on a specific article is used solely at the discretion of the developer using the Treesaver framework. Developers use HTML templates to define the UI shown by Treesaver. Within this HTML, developers can bind to variables such as the current page number & page count. Additionally, they can supply their own metadata on the article/publication level for use within the HTML. These might be used to create a running title, or provide a shortened link for twitter, or even a sidebar of navigation with titles and thumbnails for each article --- all via binding to user-provided metadata, there is no native Treesaver notion of Table of Contents UI.\nSo that means the only properties we absolutely care about, and will base behavior around are the contents array and however we decide to do properties/settings. By default, Treesaver has no use for title, author, etc -- it will only be accessed if the user explicitly builds UI that binds to that variable name.\nSo, my general priorities here are:\n1. Make sure our scenarios are possible\n2. Developer ease of use / simple documentation\n3. Easier implementation\nOK, now that I've finished that long-winded story -- here's my take on what we've been discussing:\nBook/Page Metadata\nOur scenarios are covered by being able to add metadata, and the implementation shouldn't be an issue -- so the only thing to think about here is developer usability / ease of documentation. \nIn order to make the concepts easier, I think whatever we do for the article/page level should be consistent with the publication level. \nNaming & Grouping\nYour point about standardization and future-proofing is a good one, so I think we both agree that prefixing of some sort is the way to go here. I personally think it's easier to explain/document letting custom fields be peers of other attributes that differ in that they have special prefix. If you feel strongly about boxing this into a custom bucket, let me know -- but I think it's simpler not to, even if you do pay the price of repetition. (Implementation-wise, it's trivial to ignore any key that doesn't have your prefix).\nSo, to update your example above, here's what I think we're converging to (let me know if I've missed something or made a bad assumption):\n``` js\n{\n  // Standard properties. No UA requirement to do anything with them though\n  \"title\": \"The Study in Scarlet\",\n  \"author\": \"Arthur Conan Doyle\",\n  \"creator\": [\"D. Casali\", \"M. Colombo\", \"A. Morandi\", \"F. Fortes\"],\n  \"date: \"2011-08-23\",\n  \"url\": \"book://bakerframework.com/books/arthurconandoyle-thestudyinscarlet\",\n// I prefer settings, but I'm fine with properties if you'd prefer that :)\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"orientation\": \"both\",\n    \"pinchToZoom\": false,\n// Custom user-agent properties are prefixed. Need to chose between either be via x-ua-\n\"x-baker-background\": \"#000000\",\n\"x-baker-verticalBounce\": true,\n// Or CSS-style -ua-\n\"-baker-indexHeight\": 150,\n\"-baker-mediaAutoPlay\": true\n\n// Other UAs may have their own settings\n\"-treesaver-loopArticles\": \"true\"\n\n},\n\"contents\": [\n    \"Book Cover.html\",\n    \"Book Index.html\",\n    {\n        // Only URL is required\n        \"url\": \"Front-Article.html\",\n        // Contents is reserved?\n    // All UA-specific properties need prefixing\n    \"-treesaver-requires\": \"touch\"\n\n    // Have generic prefix for non-UA custom metadata?\n    \"custom-title\": \"The Wonders of Hpub\",\n    // Follow HTML5's lead?\n    \"data-author\": \"The community\"\n    // Go for brevity and make prefix a single -?\n    \"-shortlink\": \"http://t.co/foobar\"\n},\n\"Part1-01.html\",\n\"Part1-02.html\",\n\"Part1-03.html\",\n\"Part1-04.html\",\n\"Part1-05.html\",\n\"Part1-06.html\",\n\"Part1-07.html\",\n\"Part2-01.html\",\n\"Part2-02.html\",\n\"Part2-03.html\",\n\"Part2-04.html\",\n\"Part2-05.html\",\n\"Part2-06.html\",\n\"Part2-07.html\",\n\"Colophon.html\",\n\n],\n// Top-level custom metadata\n  \"custom-issueNumber\": 4,\n  \"data-twitter\": \"@BakerFramework\"\n}\n```\nDoes that line up with your thinking? Or did I misunderstand?\n. Less important, since Treesaver won't do anything with this natively -- I thought about the author / creator fields a bit more, and I think it may be worth providing support for \"string\" or {object}, just like with the contents array -- URL links, twitter handles, etc can be very useful. But I've got no horse in that race, so up to you :)\n. The example above works fine for Treesaver. Is the Baker team comfortable w/ it as well?\nRelated, I realized that this is flexible enough that UAs can still choose to use a settings object if they prefer:\njs\n  \"-ua-settings\": {\n    \"setting\": \"value\"\n  }\nI think we've got something fairly simple here and easy to explain. As we get implementations out there, we'll get feedback on what's confusing and what works. Then we can change as we see fit. I'm open to most anything, as long as it doesn't make our scenarios difficult or impossible. If it turns out that everyone prefers more nesting, etc -- then who am I to disagree? :)\n. @bramstein I think we prefix any built-in/native behavior until we're ready to propose them as part of the HPub spec.\n. You bring up a good point, @folletto, should there be a hpub-version property?\n. Works for me.\n. ",
    "bramstein": "Minor detail perhaps, but wouldn't it be easier to document if both top level and per article/document settings were specified in the same way (i.e. through the settings property?)\n. There's another use-case that is mostly Treesaver specific, but perhaps of interest to Baker as well. As @fortes mentioned, most of our meta-data is completely developer specific, apart from contents and url. A developer can enter any properties as meta-data and use those properties in templates.\nI recently had a case where it was useful to have the framework set some \"status\" properties on the meta-data, such as active or visited on items in the contents array. This would allow the developer to implement custom styling in their templates for currently active or previously visited articles, sections or chapters. There is however a risk of name clashes between properties created by the framework and those created by the developer. Should such properties also be prefixed, or should they go into a \"reserved\" property (for example, one called \"status\".)\n. ",

I posed the question on github regarding dates and specs for both upgrades: Baker and Laker\n. I got a response from Florian suggesting that both would be coming, Laker after Baker, that would include more xcode for navigation etc, as well as testing. But no dates or specific content were listed\n. NK integration seems pretty simple. I think there is a github thread outlining it. There is a free apple video explaining it. There's only 4 or 5 properties to set\n. the challenge of multiple issues and library was taken on by an existing contributor and there is a specific thread on github for it. I haven't heard anything though about its integration to the Baker and Laker upgrades.\n. at this point, I believe library is a separate issue from NK. I was leaning towards creating a library simply based on multiple views, dead simple in xcode. But I have no idea when ios will crap out due to memory size issues. I mean, can 1 app handle 100 chapters of html5, each with 5,000 words of content and 20 jpegs? Laker loads 1 chapter at a time, so why not?\nSo the status is still a grey area. If there's no news on the upgrades by September 4th, I am going to dig into xcode to customize my magazine app based on the older Laker. I will share my code on github as I go...feature by feature...but I would prefer to save time with Baker/Laker 3.0...\n. Thanks! Happy to work with....will read up on the details...\n.

I couldn't find a roadmap or blog post about it.  If it exists, could you point me to it, or could you give me a high level overview?\nThe main thing that we would need in baker would be newsstand integration, and hopefully, if its possible, the NKLibrary support for multiple issues.  We plan to publish future issues on AWS or some web service, do a push notification so our subscribers can download the next issue.\nThis is all code that I'm comfortable writing and contributing to Baker, or if you've already started on a solution, I'm happy to jump in and help/debug/extend. \nI couldn't find a 3.0 branch of baker.... so I'm guessing it is in the head?\nIf you think NewsstandKit integration, and Library integration don't make sense (e.g.: baker is meant for books) then I can fork, or do my own thing.\nThanks--\n.

    "steiny2k": "Hi there. Fixed it and sent you a pull request. I implemented and tested it together with ffranke (I'm this \"programmer\"-guy he's referring to some times :P).\nSee: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/pull/324\n. Hi, everyone. Thanks for the feedback. \nFor the iOS4 problem: I was aware of that. But since the dismiss/presentModalViewControllerAnimated functions are deprecated in iOS5 i thought i'd go with a solution that works for the future and omit support for iOS4. I don't know what your policy with Baker is. But if you want to support the older stuff too, then just change it like zenz proposed and it should work. If you want I can send another pull request with a solution that is working for iOS4.\nFor the orientation problem: I didn't think of that as our magazine is portrait only atm. But sure that has to be adressed. I think it shouldn't be a big problem. Just adding the landscape orientation in interface builder... let me see, what i can do, and i'll send you a new pull.\n. hm. ok. i'm kind of new to github. So closing and making a new pull request wasn't necessary i guess. well... \nsee pull 325 for further discussion: https://github.com/Simbul/baker/pull/325\nsorry for that.\n. Hi thanks for the feedback. Yeah sure. I'll do it in the next days :)\n. The last commit should include the forward/backwards-buttons and the \"open in Safari\" button. However I have a strange behaviour in the simulator (can't test on native devices atm), where switching back to the app renders a black screen during the animation. It seems like the screenshot for the fast app switching isn't generated. Any ideas why this happens, and how i can address that?\nOr maybe it's just something weird in the simulator here. I'm not sure. Please check it :)\n. well thanks @bahmet for your input. I now made the \"open modally\" optional with the last commit. Now you may use the following referrers and achive different behaviour:\n- referrer=ExternalBaker: opens the link in Safari as it was before\n- referrer=ModalBaker: opens the link in the new modal UIWebView but also allows the user to go to Safari if he wants to\n- no referrer: opens the link in the local WebView where the book is currently rendered (I don't know if this is desirable in any situation. Can't think of any...)\nNow to the problem you describe: for opening a link in safari with the current master branch add the referrer=Baker to your link (http://example.com/?referrer=Baker). For the internal links referring another page in the book, i don't actually know, why it does not work for you. If it works in the TOC, it should work in the usual book pages as well.\nUsing the target=\"blank\" attribute is not possible unfortunately as we only have the URL at the point in the code where this decision where to open the link is to be made. So using these _magic strings in the URL is actually a clever hack ;)\n. Well, there is more changes than just the rootviewcontroller.m file. Best thing would be you check out my master branch of baker from https://github.com/steiny2k/baker. It is basically the current master branch from simbul/baker but with the modal UIWebView added. So basically all the stuff that lives inside this pull request.\nThen you should be able to use this referrerr-scheme as i described in my previous comment. :) If necessary you can also adapt change the magic strings by editing the URL_OPEN_MODALLY and URL_OPEN_EXTERNAL constants in the RootViewController.m\n. Yeah most probably you're right. But letting the book designer decide whether to open a link directly in Safari or modally might also be a good idea, don't you think? But you can do as you like. Just leave out the last commit when pulling it in.\n. Hi, I'm a bit concerned with the use of the action-button to open the site in safari. I think this button should only be used when creating a action-view and allowing the user to choose from an action to perform (i.e. open in Safari, post link to Twitter, E-Mail URL or stuff like this). See the iOS Human Interface Guidelines table 7-2. It says \"Open an action sheet that allows users to take an application-specific action\".\nAs long as we don't allow users to choose from such an action sheet, maybe we should write explicitly on the button, what it will do (open in safari).\n. whow. that looks pretty ugly :( sorry for causing this.\nI was quickly looking into this, but it seems to be a bit more complex than just calling the appropriate orientation-methods from RootViewController.m. I'll dig a bit deeper soon. Keep us updated when you find something on this. Thx.\n. please have a look on pull request #343\n. see pull request #343\n. Hmm. is this some kind of policy for the Baker framework to have everything constructed in code? Actually this is the first time to have system UI visible in the framework i think.\nI thought it might be easier for the intended designers to adapt the 'look and feel' of the modal web view bar, when using interface builder. Once I did the initial 'design' of the modal webview, @ffranke was easily able to adapt the color scheme and button layout to match his needs. I think this wouldn't be possible, if constructing the UI from code. \nIf you are arguing for speed, I think 10-15% speed-up is not such a big deal: http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/03/load-from-nib-or-construct-views-in.html\n. hm. it seems to me the device orientation isn't properly reported to the website. Try to read the values via JavaScript maybe using this snippet:\njavascript\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var dpr = 1;\n        if(window.devicePixelRatio !== undefined) dpr = window.devicePixelRatio;\n        alert(\"current device pixel ratio:\" + dpr);\n        alert(\"orientation: \" + window.orientation);\n        var width = (window.innerWidth > 0) ? window.innerWidth : screen.width;\n        alert(\"device-width: \" + width);\n    </script>\nAnd post the results here.\n. Well, if I'm reading this right in https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Book.json-Baker-extension-parameters i think it should at least be possible to have the index view either on the bottom or the left side.\nHowever it will always slide in from below...\n.

If I understand properly (and please forgive me if I have wrong end of stick), this commit of Baker takes a snapshot of a page, displays that in locked form, then unlocks it when all the html has loaded.  A couple different problems show themselves:\n- sometimes the scrolling to next page seems disabled, as does doubletap to call index.html. So you are stuck on a page with no way out. This is not a crash. I notice this in particular on pages with large single images\n- the snapshot stays on screen too long, with the result that user gets confused - tapping on icon or swiping elements that do not respond. The \"real\" page does load afterwards, but there's no signal to tell user when she has shifted from \"snapshot\" to live page. Actually, if this delay is ever going to be more than 0.2 seconds, I would rather have the \"page loading\" message, short delay, and then load a live page that will respond as user expects. \nWe grateful Baker users can design our html to accommodate whatever delays are inherent in the Framework.

The perfect solution for me could be to have 3 books inside one app, each one in its own folder, and opening the correct one depending on the device language, but as far as I know, it is no possible, isn't it?\n. http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/LocalizingInterfaces.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002138-BBCBFFDF\nHere they talk about .nib and .lproj files, but I don't find any of them in Baker, and inside Xcode 4, in the main project info tab, I can see \"Localizations\", and several languages, and all say \"0 files localized\". I add Spanish, but I don't know how to add localized files :(. \n. I tried to do the following steps:\n-Within Xcode, create a \"Localizable.strings\" file and save it inside \"Resources\" folder, with the default content.\n-Click to show the \"Utilities\" right panel, and add spanish language.\n-Within Finder, I create a folder called \"book\" inside \"es.lproj\" folder, and copy there all the spanish related files, leaving the english version in the main book folder (if not, Xcode says \"No such file or directory\" error).\n-Then, I launch iPad simulator and change the language within it.\n-And then, I clean and run the scheme, but only the main english version loads :(. I tried also restoring iPad simulator, to be sure it loads a fresh copy of the app.\nMaybe I'm doing something wrong or I'm missing some step or do I need to put \"Localizable.strings\" elsewhere...\nThanks for your help\n. Ok ok, I understand. Many thanks for your help anyway!\n. Don't know. I'm new and not a programmer :(. Xcode call them \"issues\", and yes, they compile and run, but I was just worried because maybe those \"issues\" are more dangerous than I think, or maybe Apple doesn't approve apps with \"issues\" :?\n.

That's the reason that when I was flipping from 200.html (spanish cover) to 201.html the framework did not understand it and returned to 01.html. There was no 200.html on json file. Sorry. :D\n. Not yet, but I am studying a way to use html5 local storage to keep the information about the page that I am reading in that moment and pass that data to index.html and change the toc file. Did it make any sense? :D\n. I have to try this on my book tonight when I return from work, but if you wanna try first, be my guest:\nOn every page book you have to define the language using local storage inside a script tag (here I can not copy & paste):\nlocalStorage.lang=\"toc.html\";\nor, in my case, for spanish language in some pages:\nlocalStorage.lang=\"tocspa.html\";\nthen, go to index.html and write inside a script tag:\ndocument.write(\"<div id=\\\"includeTOC\\\" csi:src=\\\"inc/\"+localStorage.lang+\"\\\"></div>\");\nthis script will identify the var language that is now stored inside each page of your book. \nAs I said, I tested here on my work just using safari browser, but not yet on Baker XCode project. Hope it works :)\nIf so, I will let you know.\n. I tried here on xcode project. Strange... sometimes it works. Sometimes not. I will try tomorrow to use meta no cache because I think that maybe the page is being cached (index.html)... When I run the localStorage command alone, it works. But it's not working between the main page and index.html. I think I gonna sleep and tomorrow try again... sorry :(\n. I\u00b4m from Brazil :) \nLet\u00b4s try until it works, :D\n. Hi trikanna. I tried both ways but the reference of localstorage is being lost somehow. Sometimes the variable is undefined, even when I force the value. And when it works it's just for the first value, keeping it for the rest of the navigation, not changing when I use a function on my language buttons. I even tried to clear the values of localstorage everytime a page is loaded in portuguese (as example) and force the value to portuguese. Even so, it keeps english or spanish language as a value. Don't know what is happening. I thought that maybe tree cards was loading the contents of the other pages in memory and changing somehow the value of localstorage, but I did what you told me, to keep the function on first page only. It did not worked also. :( \nI tested on ipad and iphone and the value of localstorage sometimes is lost (undefined) and sometimes is eternal, keeping the first value for the rest of the navigation. Tried also sessionstorage and did not worked. Could you send me the 2 pages you developed so I can test in my computer? Just the code, not the contents, so you will not be worry about that. :)\nMy email is marciosmorais@gmail.com . Tks a lot. If you want, I can send you mine. All the best, Marcio\n. just to close this issue, it's possible to have more than one index file using javascript and localstorage html5 function. But it's necessary to have the first page as a language selector to pass throught the selected value to the other pages and to toc files. thank you so much to trikanna/santiago for his valuable help. ;)\n. Great book, with great pictures ! Congratulations !\nIf it's not asking too much, when you wrote \"I was able to customize the index menu, so it worked as a \"dock\" for my book and used local.storage variables to be able to communicate between pages (to play/stop music\" - can you share the code?

So it would be nice to store that information what character you got somewhere.\nI thought about using a file that gets written on the first page and read afterwards by every page on loadup with a js...but I don't know if you got the rights/possibilities to do so on the ipad.\n.

    "ayarmanqu": "Hi Folleto,\nI just want to add that my book experiences the white flash issue frequently in OS5 with an iPad 2. It comes and goes. Sometimes only the last page of the book does it and the first pages are fine.\nIf you want to test my book, let me know and I'll place a download link.\nThanks!\n. There is a free version of the book with no extras, here: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pookie-tushka-find-little/id487112926?mt=8\nI'll generate a code for the full version and send it via email.\nThank you!\nJorge\n. Oh, and ... please consider my book for Showcase :)\n. Thanks ;)\nPlease, let us know if the white flash is corrected.\nI think that is the only thing that makes it obvious that my book is not a \"full\" Xcode App :(\n(and sorry to hear about the stolen iPad)\n. Thank you :)\nUnfortunately, I don't know any ObjectiveC :/ but I'll see if I can make sense of the code somehow.\nThanks for making this product :)\n. Thank you so much for this, al3d.\nThis really helps! \nI already did some quick tests and it does allow me to communicate between the pages and the index.\n. Woooow! Thank you SO much!\nI've been searching the web for this type of tool, but I couldn't find anything!\nThis is awesome! \nJorge\n. Thanks!\nIt seems the App is crashing on some iPad 1s :/ I am assuming it is because of the video intro.\nI may need to do a version check and disabled video on iPad1.\n. Thank you :)\nI really tried to push the format and add as much content as possible.\nTons of thanks to the Baker folks :)\n. FYI, I could not get the book to work on iPad 1. No matter what I tried it always crashes. It seems the book uses too much memory :(\nOh well ...\n. Thank you, glad you liked the book :) (if you can, please give me a good rating ;)\nWell my code is very messy, but basically this is what I did:\n- I used a localStorage variable and gave it a value of 1 or 0 depending if the sound was playing or not.\n- On each page I added a play/stop button that could change the localStorage variable to 1 or 0.\n- On the index.html, I placed the background music and added a timer that would check the value of the localStorage variable every second. If the value changed to 0, then I would stop the sound.\nSo, you could add code to each page that changes the value to 0 as soon as the new page is loaded, so that the sound would stop.\nMy code is this:\n```\nvar playingbg = false;\nvar sndbg = new Audio(\"audio/BackgroundMusic.m4a\");         \nfunction playMusicbg() {   \n    localStorage.dataToStore = 0;\n    if (playingbg)\n    {\n    playingbg = false;\n    sndbg.pause();\n    sndbg.currentTime=0; \n    sndbg.removeEventListener('ended', bgEnded);  \n    document.getElementById(\"note\").src =\"images/note.png\"; \n    clearInterval(ourInterval);\n    } else { \n    playingbg = true;\n    document.getElementById(\"note\").src =\"images/note-off.png\"; \n    sndbg.play();\n    sndbg.addEventListener('ended', bgEnded); \n    var ourInterval = setInterval(check, 1000);\n    }\n }\nfunction bgEnded() { \ndocument.getElementById(\"note\").src =\"images/note.png\"; \nsndbg.removeEventListener('ended', bgEnded);  \nplayingbg = false;\nclearInterval(ourInterval);\nlocalStorage.dataToStore = 0;\n}\nfunction check(){\n    if (localStorage.dataToStore >0) {\n    playingbg = false;\n    sndbg.pause();\n    sndbg.currentTime=0; \n    sndbg.removeEventListener('ended', bgEnded);  \n    document.getElementById(\"note\").src =\"images/note.png\"; \n    clearInterval(ourInterval);\n}\n\n}\n```\nJorge\n. Hehehehe :)\nThank you :) :) :)\n. iBooks Author is very nice, but it lacks a lot of simple features.\nFor example, it seems it is impossible to place an image that will make a sound when touched.\nThe only thing you could do is either attach a movie file with sound (in which case you get a play button on top of the image) or you have to create javascript widget with Dashcode (but widgets open up in full screen and don't work within the book interface).\nSo, for textbooks it is an awesome tool, but not for other type of interactive books.\n. Hopefully! I was looking forward to using it to create a new book, but it is too limited right now.\n. ",
    "zenz": "@folletto, so sorry to hear about the stolen iPad. I hate thief!\n. it's a bug if the Readme told that it's working with iOS4.\nbut the solution is quite simple, just add a condition like:\nif ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue] >= 5.0) { \n        spinner.color = foregroundColor;\n    }\nThis can make Baker3 working with iOS4 just without the spinner.\n. My Opinion, the shelf function is very important, but should always make the book reading function in the first position.\nI mean the shelf should not be a page of a book which will disturb the reading.\nHow about display the shelf use some gesture like pinch-in? just like double tap to bring up the navigation bar(index view).\nthen, you can do anything in the popup view or window.\n. Perhaps I didn't explain it very well.\nThink about some magazine is about 20M, and your wireless connection speed is only 56kbps...\nNormally you won't touch the iPad to make it keep away from idle. if you forget to do it. and the iPad reached it's idle time, then the iPad will turn off the screen, turn off wifi......\nThen the download process will be terminated. you have to download it again.\nIs this clear?\nSo I suggested that before download process start, we use some code to avoid the iPad auto idle like this\n[UIApplication sharedApplication].idleTimerDisabled = YES;\nthen when download finished, we can enable the idle again.\n. It must be your problem.\nWe are just released a Chinese book using baker3 framework.\nThere's a lot of Chinese characters.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/id476520123?mt=8\nPlease check your program.\n. modify book.json\n\"orientation\": \"portrait\",\n. Normally it's included in baker's source code? in the book directory.\n. Because my book is based on Laker's design, so may be you can use Laker's book for a test? \nLet me explain the situation what I met.\nWhen selected \"three-cards\", although it will shows a black screen with page title, but we all understand it's loading, so we don't mind it.\nBut when selected \"screenshots\", on iPad1, it will brings a grey screen without anything for about 1 second to load the screen shots. I think that's not so good for the reader.\n. dear folletto, I did remove the app first then make clean and make run again. but the same situation.\nperhaps it's the laker's problem, but on my iPad2, it worked quite well. so I cannot agree that's the problem laker brings to me.\n. This is not very important. I just write down my solution when I hit this situation, if you cannot re-produce it, then just ignore it right now.\n. I cannot re-produce this with the new version, so close it.\n. Sorry that I didn't make it. but will try it in next week if I have piece of free time.\n. just delete the index.html, it should work\n. I just make a dirty hack with my own by modifying the downloadBook function like this:\n```\n- (void)downloadBook:(NSNotification *)notification {\nif (notification != nil) {\n    URLDownload = [[NSString stringWithString:(NSString *)[notification object]] retain];\n}   \nNSLog(@\"\u2022 Download file %@\", URLDownload);\nif ([URLDownload isEqualToString:@\"http://local\"])\n{\n    // ****** Handle: book://\n    NSLog(@\"    Page is a link with scheme book://local --> download new book\");\n\n    feedbackAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"\" \n                                               message:[NSString stringWithFormat:CLOSE_BOOK_MESSAGE]\n                                              delegate:self\n                                     cancelButtonTitle:ALERT_FEEDBACK_CANCEL\n                                     otherButtonTitles:CLOSE_BOOK_CONFIRM, nil];\n    [feedbackAlert show];\n    [feedbackAlert release];\n} else {\n\n    feedbackAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"\" \n                                               message:OPEN_BOOK_MESSAGE\n                                              delegate:self \n                                     cancelButtonTitle:ALERT_FEEDBACK_CANCEL \n                                     otherButtonTitles:OPEN_BOOK_CONFIRM, nil];\n    [feedbackAlert show];\n    [feedbackAlert release];\n}\n\n}\n```\nWaiting for the official hack.\n. Hi! Xm4s,\nOutside means using safari to handle the book://local, on my clone copy, it doesn't work.\n. Hi, Folletto,\nWhat I do:\n1. clone the newest baker code from github\n2. set target's URL scheme to book(baker's source didn't set this).\n3. compile and run on simulator.\n4. open simulator's safari, in the address bar, enter book://local\nThen I found that baker cannot handle it well(it will try to download that book but not switch back to bundle book).\nIt's the same result while running on real device.\nabout \"http://local\" is just a lazy work. because when the \"book://local\" comes to downloadBook, it's already translated to \"http://local\".\n. Yes, if use a URL scheme like \"book\", it will be a problem, but if we change it to some special name, like \"xyze\", I think this can avoid the mass.\n. That's the reason why I ask xm4s in other issue\"Is that book://local designed only for internal open bundle book?\"\nIf it's the design's reason, it's not a bug. but in my opinion, the handling should be there, just left for the user to make the decision(use it or not).\nMay be this issue can be closed and go for next one.  the issue #229 is still exist. no matter it's internal or external.\n. And also there's a problem may be belongs to this issue.\nWhile switch to bundle book for reading, while swipe to the page which was the previous book closed. it will show the screenshot of that page, but not the bundle books screenshot.\nPlease check.\n. Hi, Xm4s.\nIs that book://local designed only for internal open bundle book?\n. I re-clone the newest source code of baker from github and do the test. it's the same. while I switch back to bundle book with book://local. and then completely kill baker, and then run it again. it will just show the previous book.\n. I confirmed that with git version c63423662974, baker have the above bug. but with the newest version which have apple iCloud patch fix the problem.\ngreat work! Xm4s!!!\nPlease fix the ghost screenshot next. :)\n. I think this should be html codes problem? I use video on my app too. it seems running well. and I found if I use poster param with video element, it will create cache images on tmp folder and left there by uiwebkit.\n. Hi, Xm4s.\nThank you for your work!\nWhile I do the test. I use the fresh clone of backer on that day.\nSo, I will try it again on monday. because no coding machine in weekend.\n. Well, this problem also fixed with issue #229\n. Put book to cache directory\n\n// ****** BOOK DIRECTORIES\n        NSString *documentsPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSCachesDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) \n                  objectAtIndex:0];\n\n. Hi! Folletto,\nAs I tested. change it like what I do, every things including screenshots will be placed in the Cache folder, because the documentsPath is the base of other relative path. \nAs I remembered, the Apple official suggestion is to store those things which re-downloadable to Application's Library/Caches folder(like books mags). That's the reason I put them there.\nThere's also another solution, mark the book folder in documents to be \"do not back up\". I didn't try it yet.\n\n#include <sys/xattr.h>\n- (BOOL)addSkipBackupAttributeToItemAtURL:(NSURL *)URL\n{\n    const char* filePath = [[URL path] fileSystemRepresentation];\n\n    const char* attrName = \"com.apple.MobileBackup\";\n    u_int8_t attrValue = 1;\n\n    int result = setxattr(filePath, attrName, &attrValue, sizeof(attrValue), 0, 0);\n    return result == 0;\n}\n\nusing this solution, you must write this attribute to the book's path after extracting the book\nI think psmedia got this warning because his app download books to the documents folder(and it's too big maybe). \n. Yes, perhaps screenshots are too much in psmedia's app.\nI also use screenshot mode in previous version of my app. but it pass the exam. \n. you really should check your html coding and your files path also your files format. I am also using baker3 + laker framework(but all Jquery relative js scripts updated to newest version). every thing fine.\n. Personally, I think JSONKit is design with more clean structure, and more easy for use.\nLike original\n\nret = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithJSONString:fileJSON error:&e];\n\nAnd now\n\nret = [fileJSON objectFromJSONString];\n\nThe reason why I didn't prepare a branch on github..... because I don't know how to....shame....\n. Thank you for the HOWTO, I've just try to set it up and send a pull request. I don't know if I did it right.\n. double tap was used for showing the index(navigator)\n. It's not hard. but it's a private need.\n. about the pre-made screenshot, I mean this:\n\nNSString *screenshotFolder = [properties get:@\"-baker-page-screenshots\", nil];\n\nIn current state, the book designer can put some captured screenshots in the defined folder. so that the reading can be very smooth from the most beginning(no need to render and capture in run time). but for the reason like this topic, one folder definition is not enough while the user are using retina device. so we should figure out a solution.\n. because right now the iPad and iPhone have different display scale. so we cannot use just one resolution to solve all the problem. or else the pre-made screenshots cannot fit for the user's device. and after html rendering the display will be different. we don't want that.\nso, I personally use two folders to handle it. still use one property define. but have a device detection to confirm which folder should be use.like\nin book.json, I have\n\n\"-baker-page-screenshots\":\"pre-made\"\n\nand then I have two folder for different device\n\npre-made-ipad\npre-made-iphone\n\nnormally the retina pictures from iphone4 can display well on normal iPhone display. because they have the same scale. but I never tested on real devices.\n. please be aware that it's not only normal display and retina display's different, it's also iPad and iPhone's display scale's different. if we want to make a universal app, we must handle it well.\n. Thank you all who bring us such a good project.\n. Thank you Xm4s!\nDid you find out the reason for ghost screenshot while switch books in issue #229?\n. my be you can check github to find a branch of baker named bakershelf. \n. You can select App icons on Targets->Summary page.\nOr, you can follow apples' suggestion to use:\nIcon72.png\nIcon.png\nIcon@2x.png\nfor default icons.\n. I think apple is just want to release a tool to create iBook epub or something more advanced for iBook?\nNo matter how, it's a good thing.\n. newsstand is not only an icon in the newsstand folder, it should combine with in app purchasing & background downloading. there's a lot of works to do.\n. the ibook which created by iBook Author is just a zip file, you can easily analyze it.\nApple defined this minetype as application/x-ibooks+zip\n. come on @jameskatt, so why don't just use iBook2 to read the book in your case?\n. try #262 to see if it's workable for you.\n. download? you should checkout the tiled-screenshots branch to see if it's work or not.\n. first, you should use \"git clone https://github.com/Simbul/baker.git\" to get the baker source.\nthen use Xcode to open it. and goto organizer,goto repositories, select baker->remotes, click the arrow of origin, you will see that tiled-screenshots branch. \nWhen you need the branch, just click \"Track Branch\", if you want to jump to that branch after pull the branch source, you should select \"Automatically switch to this branch\", then click create.\nThat's all, hope you can fix your problem with this branch.\n.

Then make your books in landscape mode? it's really not a good idea to ask the user rotate the iPad just for watching the video.\n. APNS was not support in baker right now, but you can make it by yourself. easyapns is a good selection.\n. No, Please visit www.easyapns.com for details.\n. Yes, I'm using it on my app. it's quite easy for use.\n. Firstly, follow this link to add some code to BakerAppDelegate.m\nhttp://www.easyapns.com/apple-delegate\nand then in\n- (void)application:(UIApplication )application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary )userInfo\n  you should handle the different msg pushed to app. my solution is to register a notification to handle it in RootViewController.m so that all important things can be handle together. then we can just postNotificationName here in BakerAppDelegate.m\nIs this clear?\n. By the way, there is a plugin for wordpress, so if you use wordpress. then you can also give it a try(I didn't test that).\n. When you coding well and configuring the server side correctly, you should see you machine listed in the SQL database.\nAnd you need to switch the state form production to sandbox to reveive test APNS messages.\n. If you want to test APNS in local machine,you may try pushmebaby, it's also in github.\n. First of all, you don't need to open a port(actually I don't know why you guys talking about open a port). \nPlease post your logs here. Thus can help to analyst what's wrong.\n. And I need to notice you that, you must apply a uniq app profile for this app you want to use APNS, also you need to configure it within apples profile manage page. And APNS only can be tested on real machine. \n. just read the wiki or read me doc etc. then check your books carefully to see if it fits the rules very well . nothing else.\n. http://bakerframework.com/tutorials/basic\n. Even if you encrypt the books, you have to decrypt it to book folder so that UIWebView can read it. So, actually you don't need so many step to get the books content. just use iExplorer to explore the application folder to get the decrypt content is so easy.\n. May be we can learn from this?\nhttp://aptogo.co.uk/2010/07/protecting-resources/\n. I couldn't understand. sorry.\n. It's quite well, but some bugs inside, firstly, it cannot change the orientation with book(such like landscape mode). and secondly, it will crash on iOS4.\nFor the first problem, just add\n\n- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)orientation\n{\n    if ((orientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) ||\n        (orientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft) ||\n        (orientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown)||\n        (orientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight))\n        return YES;\n\n    return NO;\n}\ncan solve it, for the second one, we need to check\n. OK, for the second problem, we got it. because presentViewController:animated:completion: is not available in iOS4.\nSo just change\n[self presentViewController:myModalViewController animated:YES completion:nil];\nto\n[self presentModalViewController:myModalViewController animated:YES ];\nin RootViewController.m is OK.\nAlso\n [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil]; \nneed to be change to \n[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];\n. Congratulation!\n. you mean full screen for video?\nadd following in your page which contain video.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var vid;\n\n        function init() {\n            vid = document.getElementById(\"myVideo\");\n            vid.addEventListener(\"loadedmetadata\", addFullscreenButton, false);\n        }\n\n        function addFullscreenButton(){\n            goFullscreen();\n        }\n\n        function goFullscreen() {\n            vid.webkitEnterFullscreen();\n        }\n </script>\nload it in body tag, like <body onload=\"init();\">\nand add id=\"myVideo\" to your video.\nThat's all.\n. in this case, just tap on the video, it will bring the video to full screen and than play. that's all.\n. Actually, in this case we can do more clean up for IndexViewController.h & IndexViewController.m, because we don't need this model to detect is the index belongs to bundleBook or documentBook, it's only processing every books index page.\n. Sorry to forgot removing the conflict while sync. and all solve now.\n. Hi, Simbul! good day!\nbecause I'm not so familiar with Github. that's the reason why in the first time I got conflict version.(long time not sync)\nI don't know if I can delete my repo and re-fork from master branch of baker or not. I will try to find out the solution.\n. I still don't know how to make it work. but I have refork the master branch from Simbul/baker and commit the changes. I think you can see the difference clean and clear now. no need to merge the request. just see the difference.\n. I think I have made a clean pull request. so close this one.\n. just add some special function that a normal book cannot do is ok.\n. Hi, @Simbul, you are welcome!\nAs mentioned in previous request. this pull request is just for showing the diff and fix the IndexView bug. if it's not clean enough, you can just modify and commit your own, no need to merge.\nWe just want baker goes more and more stronger.\n. Sorry @Simbul , I'm really not good at github operating.\nPlease just check the latest commits. I just modify the Downloader.h and Downloader.m\n. ",
    "nruffilo": "Ok, I'm having this issue for both iOS 4.3 and 5.0.  I have heavy CSS animations, a voice over, and lots of images for page sizes around 1-5megs.  Ultimately the flash is VERY quick, but noticeable and I need to fix it for a current project.\nI haven't tried messing with the baker code yet (I will try that later this weekend) but I noticed that three-card loading did not produce this issue.  The only problem is, page load is what starts the animations & voice over.  Is there any way to know when the page is visible so that I can queue up the animations & voice over to play when the page is visible and not loaded with three-card?\nAny tips on how to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated, as I want to have it solved by tomorrow.\n. I SOLVED THE PROBLEM....  And this is my first attempt with Objective C :)\nIn RootViewController.m:\n```\n- (void)setupWebView:(UIWebView *)webView {\n    NSLog(@\"\u2022 Setup webView\");\nwebView.delegate = self;\n\nwebView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];\nwebView.opaque = NO;\n\n```\nThere is still a tiny flicker if your screenshot doesn't match up with your content, but worked BEAUTIFULLY with pre-rendered screenshots on my iPad 2 (iOS 5) and simulator worked well as well...\n. I'm using clear for the color - the book has many different background colors for different pages.  The issue was that, from what I see, the code was implemented in the wrong place.  I did find the \"Fix\" code in the baker framework, but when I placed it elsewhere (see my post with fix) it worked.  It works on 4.3 and 5.0.  But please, test away.\n. BTW - great job with the framework.  Really made making an ebook easy.  Not knowing objective C and having less than 1 month to build this ebook app, being able to do it all in HTML/css/javascript was amazing!\n. Screenshots worked fine for me with 3.1...\nNick\n.

To add: I've changed the delay to 5 seconds between each sound and they STILL do not work.  I have the controls visible (for debugging) and the audio is done playing, and when the 2nd one goes to play it just says: \"loading\" then the 3rd one actually plays (visually) but 50% or so of the time it will play the first note instead of third, even though the 3rd control is playing...  Tried adding a \".pause()\" before the play of the next audio - didn't work.  Again, having them all loaded, or overwriting the previous both had the same effect.  I've even tried changing the src of the one audio element.\n\nAs a small addition - there seems to be HUGE lag for the first audio in the book to load.  After that, all audio plays fine, but the first sound file played has a 1-5 second lag.  Any ideas on that as well?\n. Seems try #7 was a winner.  \n1) Created a new audio element\n2) Used setTimeout to call a \"setAudio\" function with 2 seconds delay for each audio element i wanted to play\n3) the setAudio had the following code:\ndocument.getElementById(\"snd\").pause();\n    $(\"#snd\").attr(\"src\",\"media/notes/\"+srcFile+\".m4a\");\n    document.getElementById(\"snd\").play();\nThat seemed to work fine in 4.3 and 5.0.  Still worth noting that first audio played has massive delay.\n. Nope - resetting the SRC is more accurate, but still not perfect.  I'm getting some ghosting (playing of previously loaded src) every now and again.  So I'd say this is still an issue.\n. I have exactly the same issues using new Audio...  I'll try StackOverflow....\n. To add to this, sometimes it crashes (in simulator) with the following:\n#import int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]; int retVal = UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, @\"UIApplication\", @\"BakerAppDelegate\"); [pool release]; return retVal; } --- Thread 1: Program received signal: \"EXC_BAD_ACCESS\".\n. I found a solution that has yet to fail...\nI created a global audio control: var a=new Audio();.  Whenever I wanted to play a sound I did: a.pause(); a.src='newfile.m4a'; a.play();\n.

Thanks.\n. ",
    "Dreeke": "I get the same issue. Using three-cards, only 1 image. Change orientation a couple of times on the page with the image and the app crashes.\n. I would like to chime in that the '?referrer=baker' addition to the url scheme to have the link open in safari is not handled well by our CMS. Therefore the CMS is redirecting that link it can't process to our index page.\nI have had to edit Baker's source code make this work.\nCouldn't this be a setting in info.plist?\n. Using the '?referrer=baker' parameter creates an url that the CMS ( ExpressionEngine) running the website we are linking to can't handle properly. Any url it doesn't recognize gets redirected to our homepage. The '?referrer=baker' bit that is appended to the url is not found by the CMS as a valid page, hence the redirect.\nAs we need our pages to open in Safari instead of inside the Baker app this is a problem. I hacked it and it is working by modifying the source, but this of course will break with every update. Therefore I figured a setting in the info.plist or something of the kind that flags the use of defaulting to external links or only using external links with the referrer addition in the url.\n. I have resolved the issue initially by adding media-queries to the page's css file. With your input I now understand what was happening so thank you! \nThis page is not a dedicated design for the book and I need to open it within the app so opening in Safari is not an option. \n( Need to add more interactivity to our book so it gets accepted into the App store - go rejected at first attempt on the grounds it should be a book in the iBooks Store ... sigh ... ).\n. I am running into the following problem with this implementation. I have setup a link on a page that I used to open within the books webview. In other words, without referrer. This is an online questionnaire and I would like for it to feel integrated within the app. It does indicate to the user that an internet connection is required.\nThis was working perfectly before apart from having no back and forward buttons.\nThis link is using javascript to submit a form when a user clicks the link. The form has a hidden field that passes a value that we need to log the user automatically in.\nWith the new commit after having stumbled upon this thread when searching how to tackle the back and forward buttons issue the form doesn't seem to function properly anymore ( when using a referrer, both Baker or Safari - does work without referrer ). The value we need to pass to bypass the 1st login page doesn't register somehow and we are faced with a login screen.\nThe code I am using is:\n\n            function submitform()\n            {document.forms[\"test\"].submit();}\n            \n    <form action=\"http://website.com/?referrer=Baker\" method=\"post\" id=\"test\">\n        <input type=\"hidden\" maxlength=\"255\" name=\"some field name\" value=\"our login value\"/>\n        <a href=\"javascript: submitform()\">Take the test //</a> \n    </form>\n\n\nAny suggestions or ideas?\n. The form posts to an url, passing a field with a value that allows us to automatically login. The idea is to save the user from manually having to enter a certain value. \nWhat is not happening now is when using a referrer, which I would like to do, the form submit doesn't seem to pass the value and we are taken to the default starting page instead of the desired page.\n. Just to be clear, when I don't use a referrer it is working\n. Just sent you a PM with the answers to 1 and 2. Not sure what you mean with the 'slider'.\n. To debug I have set a html background color for testing purposes which gets shown in mobile safari but not within the modal web view.\nThe real purpose is a div that I set to display:none which works in mobile safari but not within the modal web view.\nAn example of a media query as I use it to detect iPad Retina display:\n@media only screen\nand (min-device-width : 768px)\nand (max-device-width : 1024px)\nand (orientation: landscape ) \nand (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 2.0) {\n}\nI have tried different variations of the media queries and they didn't make a difference.\n. Great! Thank you!\n. Using steiny2k's javascript I noticed that on my normal html pages in Baker the orientation always returns 0. Both in portrait as well in landscape.\nTo be clear, this is on non modal-window, non external pages. On iPad and iPhone, retina and non-retina.\nThe width does change depending on orientation.\n. I have had the same problem with identical apps that differ only in textual content initially having one pass the review and one being rejected.\nI got the second one accepted after having added videos and adding an online questionnaire.\n. We already had our own custom solution, so I simply linked to that and adapted the css to cater for mobile devices.\n. ",

Most times it is crashing after i rotate the device. Seems that it's not possible to load more then 4 or 5 images at the same time.

A page with more images and videos .....\n. Okay, i think i found the problem. It's called webkit-transition...... I used the slideshow plugin of laker framework which adds webkit-transition and transform css.\nimgscroll-imgs {\ndisplay: inline; float: left;\nwidth: 100%;\nmargin: 0px; padding: 0px;\n-webkit-transition-property: -webkit-transform;\n-webkit-transition-duration: 0.5s;\n-webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-out;\n/_apply a transfor to kick in the hardware acceleration.  Without this, the first time we add the transform you get odd rendering of the divs (half missing) */\n-webkit-transform: translate3d(0px,0px,0px);\n\n}\nimgscroll-img {\ndisplay: inline; float: left;\nwidth: 100%; height: auto;\n/_apply a transfor to kick in the hardware acceleration.  Without this, the first time we add the transform you get odd rendering of the divs (half missing) */\n-webkit-transform: translate3d(0px,0px,0px);\n\n}\nI think there is no more hardware acceleration under IOS5 or the performance is worse than under iOS 4.X. Don't know why, but after removing the transition stuff it seems to work. Tomorrow i will try to rewrite the slideshow without the transition.\nThanks for your help!\n. Tried it on mobile safari without any issues, but when i tried to view the video in chrome for iOS i have the same issue after trying to play the video a second time.\n. Tried it again with chrome and different baker versions. Older versions of baker works fine, only the latest versions is buggy. Chrome does not have the issue anymore.\nAny ideas? There are too many changes in baker code and I have no idea where to start debugging.\n. I did some tests again and chrome doesn't have the problem (anymore?). With baker version 3.2 it works, but with 3.2.2 videos are not played.\n. Yes, that is correct. If you create an application under 3.2.2 with the template book and just add the vimeo embed code. The video is not playing.\n. Youtube plays, but pausing the video is not possible. The controls doesn't seem to work.\nSo there is currently no solution i know to embed video - URL's under baker.\nAny ideas?\n. You mean the normal  tag?\n. Ah I found that the video tag is a much better solution for me. Added the vimeo files to the video tag. Tried also some other sources. In safari the video tag play the audio too, but not in baker. Any ideas?\n. Audio problem solved.\nhttps://github.com/Simbul/baker/pull/521\n. Hi Simbul,\nthis pull request does not solve the iframe problems, but solves the problem that videos were not able to be played at all under iOS6.\nIf you create a video tag and add a URL ( for example to the m4v on your vimeo account ) you were not able to hear any sound on video playback.\nThe pull requests solves the issue that under iOS6 you need to create a audio session before instantiating a UIWebView.\nI tried everything to get a running iFrame player under baker with iOS6, but this does not seem to be possible.\nRegards\nDominic\n. No, it did not work. iFrame implementations are buggy und iOS6. Solved it using the vimeo video URLS and the html5 video tag. Works much more stable than any iFrame implementation.\nThanks for your help!\nRegards\nDominic\n. ",

Added User Agent Tweak :)\n. In the New InDesign CS5.5 it has \"Improved support for ePub and HTML5 Exporting\"\n. How does it look different? show us images. \nThe problem is inDesign is trying to use new HTML5 technologies where older apps would of just turned it into images which goes against the nature of HTML Design where text and the layout should adapt to the screen size. The con is obviously your layout won't be pixel perfect but to be honest this is a trade off you should be prepared to face in general if you are using HTML based technologies especially if you want a satisfactory experience for the user.\nTry exporting it in ePub though if you arnt sure see how that looks (use a epub reader) if it works then look inside the epub and there should be a load of html files containing your pages of your magazine\nIf that doesn't work then the options are really:\n- Use images but with positioned divs for the dynamic content, bad experience for the user but lots of control for client\n- Except that HTML isn't a fixed page and your design might not look the same even if inDesign can't export it very well\n- Recode it yourself in HTML \n-  Stick to Mag+\n. Master at the moment haven't quite got my head round github enough to be able to edit paticular branches :) if its an issue I can always send you the code.\nOkay basically in an essence:\nScrollSwipe - Will be how we implement it in Baker today, with the scrollview wrapping a bunch of webviews\nPage - Will be the new UIPageViewController in Page Turn Mode which will look like iBooks\nSwipe - Will be the new UIPageViewController in Scroll Mode which will be like how baker does it today but using the native functionality of the UIPageViewController to achieve it.\nMaybe we could come up with better names for ScrollSwipe and Swipe. I was thinking originally Legacy or Baker, Page and Swipe or Scroll but wasn't sure.\nOne question where is the part of the code where the scrollview gets it's first webview when the first page is loaded, at the moment I can only get pages to appear in the page view if I make a fake page and then load in the current webview for the current page by doing the page turn gesture. Also how does the page turning work currently ? I've got a vague understanding :) of how the code works through trial and error :)\nJames\n. Ah I see, I'm right now trying to break out the instanation of the Webviews, so that I can get the correct one for the next page :) Which is the biggest headache. I also need to make the pagecontroller detect when the first webview is created so it can display it as the first page.\nThe only pros to keeping the current implementation is backwards compatibility with older Devices. At the moment the Native one only works with iOS 6 above in Scroll Mode :) and iOS 5 above in page turn mode. We can't fully move over to it unless we want to cut off people below iOS 5. (And disable the use of the page scrolling for people below iOS 6)\n. I think I have figured out the UIWebView code, correct me if i'm wrong. \nIn three-cards:\nWhen you turn the page, the scroll view puts in the boilerplate loading UI and requests the next page from the book.\nThe code checks if the user hasn't moved so much that the pages it has preloaded are invalid (i.e they move 2 pages instead of 1) and that the next page has loaded.\nIf they are loaded then the pointers are reshuffled so the next page pointer contains null and current page contains what was originally in the next page pointer.\nthe webview is injected into the scrollview and the pointers and shown as the current view. If not then the pointer reshuffling occurs still but the next page is placed onto a queue and loaded.\nOnce loaded the webview is assigned to the current page pointer and injected into the view.\nIf we arn't using three card mode then we simply inject the screenshot image if available until the webview is loaded and we can inject that. We then take a screen shot if not.\n. Awesome I think that flow could somehow be hacked into UIPageViewController :) \nOn 4 Nov 2012, at 21:11, Davide Casali wrote:\n\nYes, seems correct to me. :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Okay made some progress it works now :) Just need to get screenshots working. Then I'll probarly have to restructure the code :) so that it properly integrates with the three-cards system as well. I'll also implement some navigation methods for the UIPageView as it can't use the scroll views.\n\nWe will probably have to abstract this, I was thinking that basically the UIScrollView and UIPageViewController could be treated like wrappers and implement the required Protocol which then the main BakerViewController will use to talk to them and give them the WebViews once they are loaded and also inform them of any other state changes like the app launching, closing etc etc. The Wrappers could then request the next page etc as well :).\nThen basically the app reads the manifest and works out which Wrapper it needs to load (UIPageViewController or UIScrollView) based on the type of page turning.\nI think we will end up with a lot of ifs and elses otherwise.\nThe Scroll mode on UIPageViewController works but is a little buggy at the moment.\n\n. Awesome, would it be okay if I put this into another branch for now, as this could break the code for the other branches ? I will upload what I've got later today :) to show it working \nOn 5 Nov 2012, at 10:07, Davide Casali wrote:\n\nImpressive work. :)\nMay I nudge you a bit to use GitHub to show the code to us (and the future Pull Request)?

So basically it would preload the previous and next page like three cards does, but in addition to that would also show a screenshot of the page just before it's loaded like screenshot mode. So if the user navigated to a page that hadn't been or had not finished preloading they would get a nice screenshot this would especially look nice with the page view controller :). \nJames\nOn 5 Nov 2012, at 14:02, Davide Casali wrote:\n\nIt should be fine creating your branch and linking it here for now, because in that way we can see the progress and test it.

Ahh, Okay :) I will do that, sorry I get a bit carried away :) when things start getting awesome :). I'll just finish off my abstraction of the view so that the old scrollview and new page view are interchangeable, which should make it less buggy and more manageable.\n. Just a small progress update :) reworked a lot of your view based code. It seems to be a lot more quick and nifty still got to implement the wrappers that let the user swipe between pages. I've almost got the page stuff it's self working, just gotta do screenshots and the webview stuff :)\n. I've noticed that the book title is incorrect in the manifest. \n\nAnyways I've got my page controller working :) I am reimplementing stuff for the new View System. I have left is link handling, anchors, scroll direction remembering, better orientation, old baker navigation system, index view, gestures and screenshots.\n. :) oops.\nIt's okay :) I've got iOS 4.0 compatibility working (So if a book uses the page turn transition on iOS4 it will just drop back to using the Scroll View) and it now calculates page size correctly.\n:) Just got gestures and index view. Anchors, Scroll Offset, Screenshots and Link Handling Left. A lot of it is in the same cluster of issues really :) I'll probably submit a pull request once all of this is implemented so you can take a look and refine and optimise it all (it can lag occasionally)\n.

I struggled with actually stating this in a reply but here goes:\nThe challenge with OpenSource growth is in its developers inability to\ndocument their own code.\nLots of developers want to reuse, extend, modify OpenSource. Whether or not\nprojects are extended by its audience is predicated by two things: Whether\nthey can confidently modify existing code - within a construct and have the\n\"audacity\" to share it and whether or not they have the skills.\nThe skills part is frequently driven by their ability to understand what is\nin front of them.  Sure, they might understand what is being done line by\nline; or they can scan well-commented code and go to the right place.\n Whether they do the latter is driven by their ability to devote and\nwillingness to invest the time.\nThe last sentence is me.  Nonetheless, I'm looking for the right place to\ngive you a good example. I've used Localytics and it works wonderfully.\n. I think if you add the load library stuff in the app delegate as in the\nLocalytics docs and then look at the RootViewController - around Line 542\npragma mark \"Loading\"\nDown at line 568, it's loading a page (in a rect view).\ncurrentPageNumber is an integer, you can get that - otherwise, I believe\npages objectAtIndex is the actual localURL (NSURL datatype)..\nShort of any documentation and loading up the Localytics library, I think\nthat's your \"insertion\" point.\nHope that helps.\n. Hi, without getting into a huge debate....\n(Pardon my directness, it avoids people guessing what's on my mind...LOL)\nI agree that you did INCREDIBLE WORK!!!\nAfter being in code since 1999, I find that if I don't document everything\nas I go, I find that I have to retrain myself each and every time I go back\ninto the code.  The time that takes = the time it takes to document as you\ngo.\nThe challenge with any new project is that you cycle through adding code\nand modifying what you have over and over again until it works. That really\ngets in the way!!!\nAt any rate, we have what we have and I am truly appreciative of what you\nhave done.  I hope in some small way I can continue to contribute to the\ncommunity.\nBest Wishes, jws\n. Yep. Agree!\nDavid, what would have saved me the most time is this:\n\"Given a JSON file with HTML, count page numbers, pull in content into a\nCGRect, along the way zipping screen shots to increase page view\nperformance.\nThe major portions of code you should know are:\nRoot View Controller does the heavy lifting for pages.\nProperties does retrieval for pages and yada yada.\nInterceptor handles the popup view below.\"\nAnd I'm still not sure that's right! LOL\n. Nicely done!!! Were you able to look at Localytics?  It is significantly easier than this... Essentially, include the lib and add your events.  No NSDicts required (which aren't fun). Lastly, if you look at Parse.com - a great mobile back end - you can spin your own events, then point your own graphing products at the data restfully.  You really are invested here I think and I think you did a great job spelling it all out.  Better than perhaps Flurry!!! \n. @MrSpukhaus There are two things that come to mind here about your request:\n1) Open Source is exactly that. People have the right to embrace/extend/embellish at will.\n2) The concept of \"author\" applies equally to developer and content creator. As such, either author may be in control of the programmatic content or the digital content riding on top of the programmatic content. Authors have/should/may/can have rights to what is the ultimate form of their content.\nThat being said, it is truly unfortunate where a small disclosure about usage tracking can solve a whole volume of issues. It is also truly unfortunate that content creators (authors) have to keep in mind that they may be creating something of breadth and scope beyond a normal pedestrian's understanding; in spite of the fact that it was or was not the original authors intent to care.\nThis is going around Reddit these days - which, at a minimum, got me thinking:\nI would much rather be ignorant to the rules of my world, than to be ruthlessly bound to them simply by knowing them.\n(I don't know the author of this; however, the question is \"What is it like being made of code?\")\nDoes this capture the mindset of the author or the reader or the authorities that create such restrictions? In these days of ACTA/SOPA/PIPA, it appears that the latter has more say than the former.\n. ",

Did you make any changes to the usual settings and what type of caching mode did you use. All the others have super long loading times and that spinning wheel when I swipe to a new page. One that is working better is a bit jumpy. But with your mag thats not at all the case. \nWould be awesome to hear back from you. \nSabine\n. ",

    "nerveband": "Woohoo! Glad to help!\n. I have been testing and looking around the issue multiple times over and I found a solution/workaround\nThe way that Baker implemented the navigation with the viewport arrangement in version 3.2 is quite clever. In essence, it doesn't need the book.json to declare the height or width of the navigation bar. It is now defined using the viewport value in the index.html. Florian (laker's lead developer) thought it was an issue with the include script that he used to include HTML files. However, that is not the case.\nIt all lies in the viewport definition in the index file. I was originally defining the width of the entire include element (and thus the document) using CSS on the include element. However, that wasn't registering the size of the viewport. So instead of using CSS, I explicitly defined the size of the viewport height and width. Needless to say, that solved the problem :)\nSteps to fix:\n1) Open index.html in /book in your favorite text editor\n2) Replace the following line:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no;\" />\nWith the following:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=2040; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no;\" />\n3) Save and run in the simulator\nPlease note the following:\n- For additional navigation elements to fit, you need to add additional pixels to the width. In Laker's example, it's 410 per navigational stretch\n- Baker developers should support the device-width to prevent this issue from cropping up\n- For Laker 1.3 specifically, you can modify the table of contents directly in the index.html.\n. I also ran into that same issue and I fixed it the same way.\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=2040; height:205; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no;\" />\nI'd also remove the line defining the navigation height in book.json to prevent any conflict of size selection.\nYour browser's inspector can help you determine what the right sizes to appropriate:\nSee this image: http://d.pr/i/GoQz\n. Whoops, I noticed an error in my syntax in my previous post. There should have been an equal sign, not a colon (CSS and HTML confusion right there). The reason why you can push the table of contents \"up and down\" is because the viewing window is smaller than the height of the HTML document. Basic steps to follow:\n1) Remove line determining navigation height in book.json (-baker-index-height: xx)\n2) Open your index.html and edit the viewport to reflect the following:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=2040; height=205; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no;\" />\nNote that you may have to change the height depending on your specification navigation. Try values like 202, 204, etc. until that solves your problem. Also, when running your tests, make sure you run clean from the projects menu followed by build to ensure the cache has been flushed and the changes are rendered.\nYou also might be able to solve the problem by defining a larger height in your book.json. Whatever value you put in book.json will override the viewport value.\n. ",

Half expected to find a solution straight after posting here, but glad I have. Sorry to bother you!\nSteve\n. This has been an issue for a while, even moreso since the release of iBooks Author. There are dozens of apps approved and released into the App Store each day that are nothing more than text books. Yet some (like yours) are rejected and steered towards the iBookstore. In many respects it comes down to individual reviewers at Apple, so you MIGHT have luck just cancelling the binary and starting again. But ideally, you need some kind of interactive content, like a game. quiz or social media connectivity. \nI think we're going to see this more and more with Baker-made apps.\n. Nice. Kind of proves what I suggested - that book app approvals come down to individual reviewers. \nCongrats on the release of your app. Unfortunately I can't speak Turkish, but it looks nice.\n. I had that problem before the TOC update and fixed it with a bit of trial-and-error.\nThere's a few things it could be but chances are it's a problem with book.json. Make sure the book.json is exactly as it should be. In my case it was a comma after my last html page when there shouldn't be one, for example:\n\"contents\": [\n    \"0001.html\",\n    \"0002.html\",        \n    \"001.html\",\n    \"002.html\",\n    \"003.html\",\n    \"004.html\",\n    \"005.html\"\n]\n. In my case, this problem was caused by css clashes/hiccups. Two things I suggest:\n1. Make sure your width is correctly set (number of indexed pages x 410px) in nav.css.\n2. Include a direct link to nav.css in the header of your index.html, i.e. \"link href=\"styles/nav.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\". (For some reason, this wasn't being imported in my app.)\n. I wanted to do this too a while ago, and found it was possible to load a single mp3 using Javascript in index.html, which then plays throughout the entire book. But managing the audio thereafter is impossible. There was certainly no way of having different background audio for different pages/chapters, which is what I wanted. \n. ",

In my opinion, Baker already does this. It's not a perfect framework, as there are still some things not implemented, but it's not bad.\n\nAgain, it is quite easy to design a magazine in InDesign and output each page as an image. There are probably different ways to skin that cat, but I just export as PDF, then create images for each page. The Baker framework then gives me HTML for each page, onto which I can code up elements in CSS or embed videos, or whatever. So, really, my approach to it is to do all the interactive programming in HTML on top of PNG files within XCode. I DO NOT do anything interactive in InDesign, I find HTML is much easier and robust.

Hi, I don't know if that is exactly what you looking for but you could take a look at touchswipe. I'm using it and it fulfills my needs... http://labs.skinkers.com/touchSwipe/\n. I'm thinking in two ways to solve that -\nAlternative #1 (tested and works): create a script to listen to webkitendfullscreen and call a custom scheme to updateBookLayout. Ex:\nin HTML:\n    var html5Video = function() {\n       return {\n           init: function() {\n           var video = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0];\n           video.addEventListener('webkitendfullscreen', exitFS, false);\n            }\n    };\n    }();\nfunction exitFS() { \n      window.location = \"exitfs://\";\n  }\nhtml5Video.init();\nin webview shouldStartLoadWithRequest: (add another else loop to catch new scheme)\n```\nelse if ([[url scheme] isEqualToString:@\"exitfs\"]) {\n            [self performSelector:@selector(updateBookLayout)];\n\n            // Cancel the location change\n            return NO;\n        }\n\n```\nAlternative #2: I think it's an undocumented feature, so use it with caution: use UIMoviePlayerControllerDidExitFullscreenNotification to fire updateBookLayout.\n.

    "mcnejef": "Clovis, not quite what I was looking for.  I think it has more to do with the app container (the xcode project) constantly listening for swipe and double click events.  I have figured out a workaround (loosely, xcode is not my thang...).  \nInside of the shouldStartLoadWithRequest method in RootViewController.m I've modified the \"PageNotFound\" section to look like:\n```\n                if (page == NSNotFound)\n                {\n                    // ** Internal link, but not one of the book pages --> load page anyway\n                NSLog(@\"    Page not in index --> disabling swipes and double-clicks\");\n                scrollView.scrollEnabled = NO;\n                doubleTapEnabled= NO;\n\n                return YES;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                scrollView.scrollEnabled = [[properties get:@\"-baker-page-turn-swipe\", nil] boolValue];\n                doubleTapEnabled= YES;\n            }\n\n```\nAnd that \"doubleTapEnabled\" is a property I added along with a new condition inside of \"userDidTap\" that disables the double-click registration.  This effectively turns off click handling when you navigate to a page that isn't in the book manifest.  I do have one problem that swipes on these pages are still \"stored\" somehow, and the swipe is registered when navigation is returned to a book page.  Like if I link back to page 3, but I had two L->R swipes while on the NSNotFound page I'll see transitions that take me back to page 1.  I can describe this better if anyone wants to hear about it ;-)\nSo, I realize a better way of doing this would be to create my own custom link prefix and handler like, \"noclick://page.html\", but the method above works for me as I won't be including links to web-hosted pages.  I would however, still appreciate it if I could pop a modal from within a book page that 1)froze vertical scrolling, 2)stopped page swiping, 3) stopped double-clicks and 4) still allowed events to be captured by javascript (which I don't think would be a problem based my other experiences with the platform).\nThanks!\n.

    "jhmac": "I am having problems with the edge animate. It does not seem to work for me. I am trying to make my html work with the the retina display. If I could get it to stay in portrait it would help. I have only worked with it a few hours today but it distorts in portrait for me. If you have any suggestions let me know. From what I read today it has something to do with the js it produces for the height property.\n. yep, It see it now. I will try it, thanks for the help.\n. Your suggestion about the portrait only worked perfectly. Now the major hangup is the text size. This is the last hurdle, but is a big one I am finding out. The size of the text stays the same and only the div re-sizes. From what I gather the only way to fix this is pretty JS intensive. Also the transition of the edge pages are very abrupt. I also am trying it using fluid grid layouts in Dreamweaver. With this I am having trouble with certain pages flashing white after they load. Not all the pages do this so I am trying to figure out why only some do. As of now only pages with a single image and no text are flashing white after they load.  I have some the pages with images and and text that are not flashing and even some pages with a single image that are not flashing. Suggestions are always welcome.\nScratch that. It is flashing on pages with text also.\n. When you say heavy, do you mean size as in a 290k image? Also, I just tried it on in the simulator for the first time and the Book Index.html (default downloaded from baker) page is flashing. It was not doing it on my ipad. So if you are talking about image size,  does this mean I can not have full page images(1536 x 2048) for the retina display? If so this puts a kink in things, I am wanting to put photo shoots in the mag.\n. When I create a page in edge they load differently than a normal html page. It does not flash but it does not transition in. It loads a white page with and then shows the edge page. After you view an html page it stay in the book and does not have to reload. The edge page has to load every time. I do not know if that is clear or not. I am going to try a blank html page from dreamweaver then make the page in edge.\n. @davsuas What do you mean by the reader mode flag? I am sure it is something I have to add, but I have not heard of it before. What did you add to the book.json to get it to transition the way it does normally.

I know people use to get rejected by section 2.21 (i think).\nHere is some of the first pages in the rejected app: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1sqsf9fzmk3fvj/dzcnSvgTP3?%20m\nIts not state of the art, but neither the worst thing i have seen in App Store.\n. I  wrote to Apple to get a more precise reason why the rejected my app.\nYesterday evening a guy from Apple in San Jose called me. I was unable to pick up the phone, so I will call him today.\n. I have been in contact with Apple. They think my app should be submitted to iBooks Store. It needs native iOS functionality to be acceptet in App Store.\nI just wonder why my app is rejected, when there are  100 + similar magazines in the App Store already.\nI can solve the problem by building in things I feel do not belong in a magazine. I guess a interactive map or a video will do the job.\nSuggestions are very welcome.\n. I think I found the real reason for the rejection.\nI have done all my testing on af iPad 1, because my iPad 3 was dedicated to iOS 6 testing, which the old production version Xcode could not build to.\nNow after updating Xcode, I can see that my magazine behaves completely different on my two devices.\n1) iPad 1, iOS 5\n2) iPad 3, iOS 6\nOn 1) everything looks as intended.\nOn 2) the content looks fine in portrait mode, but not in landscape. The content will not rotate at all. \nIf i start the app in portrait the content will not rotate. If i start in landscape, the content will still not rotate, but it is formated for 1024_768 (instead of 768_1024), which means that everything is messed up. For instance the index-file can be seen on the screen.\nIt is the same project build on two different devices. I do not know if the difference is caused p\u00e5 iOS og the device (ipad 1 vs. ipad 3) og retina vs non-retina.\nI hope someone can help me figureing out wat is going on.\n. There is an issue. I have tried with af clean install of Baker Framework and the book example. It behaves the same way: Will not rotate in landscape.\nI also have tried to download som Baker build apps from the App Store. Same ting.\n. It works for me in iOS 6 and iOS 5.\nThanks,\n. Maybe it is time to build iOS native stuff into the framework itself to ensure that the apps will be accepted by Apple. Rigth now we have to do it ourself depending of out personally needs.\nOne thing most people could use, and at standard magazine function, is the ability to mark pages as favourites with a star or someting. This should be combined with some sort of section where the favourites can be seen, sorted etc. If you put alle this in objectiveC and not HTML/javascript you have a iOS native functionality.\nYou can show a standard navigation bar at the top with the required buttons to mark as favourite and to show the list. The navigation bar can show up along with the index.html file when you tap a page.\nAnother posibility is to build in support for in app purchase and newsstand support.\n. ",

Thanks for getting back to me folletto, that was definitely part of the problem. I thought I had gone over that too since I saw a post with a similar issue resolved by removing a misplaced comma, my eyes must be getting bad :)\nAnother issue I think caused the problem were the size of my images, they were almost twice the retina display resolution and I think it was bogging things down. After bringing them down to the right res it loaded up perfectly. So if anyone else runs into a similar problem, check the dpi of your images.\nCheers!\n. ",

    "thejtate": "Using Baker 3.2.2. I loaded up the example Book it comes with and it seems that does it as well. \nCould it have anything to do with the meta information? \n\n. I loaded Baker 3.1 and it still seemed to do it (don't want to go any lower than that). So odd.\nI tried stripping out all the CSS and just have a simple image loading on the page using media queries to load the size depending on if it's portrait or landscape. But I can still see a lag time when the orientation changes and the images has to take a second to resize. Does the same thing if it's just a div or the body tag. \nI'm use to using a responsive grid format for site design (stuck with Skeleton) but a big question I have is:\nIs it common practice to have ALL styles nested in the CSS media queries for iPad/iPhone development or just have a typical responsive CSS setup? \nEdit: I am curious if I need to just load Javascript to handle the orientation change instead of having CSS do so.\n. Yeah, that's what I would figure. It acts like my CSS takes a bit to 'kick in' when it reads the current devices screen resolution. \nHere is the video: https://vimeo.com/53901289\n. Looking into possibly doing some sort of preloader that will let the entire page load before displaying anything upon orientation change. Seen a few others do this with Baker, seems like a good quick fix. \nI checked out Laker's book example and it does the same thing. Surprised not anyone else has really been bugged by this. \nEdit: Where could I grab later builds of Baker? Like to give those a shot, might as well. \n. @danielreiser Sweet, sounds good. Thanks again! \n. Great! I'll port over my changes and check it out later today. \nEdit: Seems to work a lot better. Still does a funky animation jerk but the CSS does load fast enough. \n. ",
    "gpbl": "Yes, I meant the vertical scroll (when the logs say 'User scroll'). I would like to run some code while the page is scrolling, but the js event doesn't work very well since it doesn't detect the inertia.\nEvents before switching the page would be useful if we are able to stop them...they should work like the body's load/unload events. Don't think this would be easy to implement though ...\n. ",
