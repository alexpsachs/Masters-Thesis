    "Lokaltog": "Thanks for the patch! Merged in 80b10ebfc98a6d83b3045d5e7631509a69157108.\n. I don't particularily like the arrows, but I agree with the idea of including symbols which are compatible with most setups without requiring a patched font. I thought that the separators might look better with the medium shade glyph (\u2592) instead, so that the separator effect is a gradient rather than an arrow. What do you think?\n. Yeah, that looks pretty bad. I'll investigate this further, and if I can't find any better solutions I'll merge this one.\n. I won't merge this because it includes a merge commit and the coding seems like a copypaste of another segment. I will however try to add proper VirtualEnv support when I have the time.\n. Closed due to a lot of core changes introduced in 4a0a52cc76851f1ab38ccee01c7aa9eeb9927568. Please resubmit the pull request if you update the code to work with the latest revision.\n. Could you upload a screenshot so I can see how it looks?\n. Looks pretty good, let me know when you've worked on it and I'll merge it into the main repo.\n. Thanks! I'll wait with the merging of these commits until I have some customizing solution (#37) so that it's possible to enable and disable each segment of the statusline.\n. See #37 and the feature/customizability branch for progress on the customization. I'm hoping that it will be ready soon.\n. Closed by 404c8b0d400e98e685a2bbc81cdea1169f837071.\n.

I could be missing something here, but is there any reason why you don't use the %B statusline flag (hex value of the character under the cursor), or getline('.')[col('.') - 1] combined with char2nr/nr2char?\n. No, I'll handle it. I don't want it to be part of the main theme, but rather a segment that may be manually inserted for those who need it, so I'll close this pull request when I've created the new segment.\n. I think your method may be the best way of retrieving both the character under the cursor as well as the character code. I've created a modified version of your function which I'll commit soon.\n. Thanks, I'll fix this soon.\nRefs #79.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I won't merge this directly because I want to modify the code a bit (I want to create a combined function for the branch segment that works with several VCS plugins, and create a configurable line info segment). I'll close this pull request when I've updated the code.\n. This project is deprecated in favor of Powerline, a Python-based port of this project.

Those who are interested can add it to their theme using Pl#Theme#InsertSegment().\n. Thanks for creating a Solarized theme for Powerline. I'll merge this into the main repo if you can create a new pull request with a single commit that conforms with Tim Pope's guidelines for git commits.\n. It looks good, but I'm unsure about merging this into the main repo. I'll merge it if anyone else thinks it's a good idea.\n. I'm closing this due to lack of feedback.\n. Looks good. I'm currently merging several pull requests and I want to include this, has the theme been updated so the statusbar has the correct color?\n. Thanks. I removed the sass segment from the commit and did some minor changes to the colorscheme file so you should pull the latest changes from my repo.\n. This is actually intentional as it will automatically reformat paragraphs with the wa formatoptions (see :h fo-table). I don't know if this is bad practice (I remove trailing WS from all other files), but I find it pretty useful for keeping text files automatically formatted.\n. What exactly does this change do?\n. Looks good, thanks! I'll merge it soon.\n. I'll consider merging this, but I really want something that draws attention to the segment and the slashes makes the segment much more visible in my opinion. Do you have any suggestions to how we could draw attention to the segment (it's reporting errors so it should be very visible) apart from having \"noisy\" symbols in it?\n. Sorry man, I've been on vacation. I'm reviewing and merging all the pull requests now. :)\n. I agree, I'd rather just change the default gray color than merge this.\n. Good idea, thanks!\n.

This project is deprecated in favor of Powerline, a Python-based port of this project. No new features or other changes are going to be accepted into this project.\n. I disagree with this and won't merge it into the develop branch. I think the statusline should be as simple as possible, and it's a given that there's no branch available if the segment is missing from the statusline. I know that this is an issue with colorschemes that want a different bg color for the branch segment, but this is already resolved in the upcoming Powerline version.\n. Thanks!

I'm wondering if you are considering taking submissions like this one, similar to what oh-my-zsh does, to ship powerline vim with a few different themes?\n. Sounds good, thank you.\n. My pleasure :) If you love solarized check out my dotfiles project which has all vim plugins optimized for solarized http://skwp.github.com/dotfiles\n. This is a solarized dark. @kepbod I recommend taking a look at my changes and taking a look at the solarized website. It should be pretty easy to plug in the colors you want.\n. @cj hmm, check out the theme code, it's actually pretty straightforward. maybe there's an obvious use of one of the 'gray' colors instead of 'base'. i don't know when i'll be able to look at this\n. Yes updated, I force pushed. It doesn't look 100% in non macvim for me, but for @cj above seems to work right. I don't use non-macvim so didn't figure out what's wrong. I'm not even getting the blue color outside of macvim either. The theme works well in macvim, so up to you whether to merge it in that state, it may take me some time to make it work 100% on command line since I don't use that.\n. :+1:\n. This theme is for dark, but take a look at how it's done, then go to solarized website and pull up the color codes, it should be pretty easy to substitute the light ones in there. I don't use light so I didn't spend time making that work..\n. Fyi the git branch is indicated in the skwp theme, as is paste mode (on the right) :)\n. @patricklewis fyi the wierd version wiht missing segments and that says \"Help\" was apparently the result of some bug on the main fork. My theme didn't have these problems till it was merged upstream, but they supposedly fixed it in https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/pull/141\n. Nicely done sir :)\n. ",

Both are WIP but I'm using them daily with the default theme.\n. @patricklewis The middle being the same color is an intentional design choice (that I realize some might not like, hence why I'm making an LC and a normal version).

Colorschemes in this case are in better position: while in order to add support for powerline to foreign plugins changes to colorscheme and default theme are needed (unless author accepts something like what I suggested in issue #155), adding powerline support to colorscheme is just placing one file in a proper location.\n. @patricklewis Just look at screenshots.
