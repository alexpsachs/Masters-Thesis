    "youknowone": "Thank you!\n. Fixed!\n. Of course, every components are in the plan. I am feeling hard to choose priority. I will take this as next work. Thanks for suggestion!\n. It works now, except system tab bar items.\n. Thank you! Looks great and license seems compatible too!\n. @KieranLafferty Hi. I wish there were like or +1 button for your comment. Thanks for good switch implementation ;)\n. Actually, I don't know about these issues very well either.\nAs you see, my basic strategy about this problems in UI7Kit is subclassing to retrieve values from xib/storyboard. (Just to enable users can edit values on Interface builder)\nI guess most of values are accessible after initWithCoder: done. And we can do another tricks to hide original UISwitch in awakeFromNib, if needed.\nSorry about unuseful comment. I believe there are each tricks to patch each controls. I will try your switch after basic works.\n. I agree that would be bad idea for KLSwitch :)\nUI7Kit is intending both a dependent toolkit and drop-in replacement of UIKit. If I don't inherit UISwitch, people cannot place UISwitch on interface builder and select new switch class. This must be confusing exception. So I still need to subclass UISwitch.\nDo you know any other clever solution about this?\n. Great. Because I failed similar trick with UIButton, I thought initWithCoder: should return the pointer what it receive. I must did something other wrong before.\nI am trying to override UIButton from UIControl\nHow did you decode your values?\nI have no time to test more at this time, but I confirmed storyboard uses decodeXXXForKey: too. So it must work. I will do this more in the night.\nI tried:\nself = [UIControl methodImplementationForSelector:@selector(initWithCoder:)](self, _cmd, aDecoder);\nAnd got method calls of:\n206989 + UIControl NSObject methodImplementationForSelector:                           \n206990 - UIControl UIControl initWithCoder:                                            \n206991 - UIView UIView initWithCoder:                                                  \n206992 - UIResponder NSObject init \n206993 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder containsValueForKey:                                \n206994 - UINibStringIDTable UINibStringIDTable lookupKey:identifier:                   \n206995 - __NSCFConstantString __NSCFString hash                                        \n206996 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder decodeCGRectForKey:                                 \n206997 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder decodeArrayOfCGFloats:count:forKey:                 \n206998 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder decodeBytesForKey:returnedLength:                   \n206999 - UINibStringIDTable UINibStringIDTable lookupKey:identifier:                   \n207000 - __NSCFConstantString __NSCFString hash                                        \n207001 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder decodeCGPointForKey:                                \n207002 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder decodeArrayOfCGFloats:count:forKey:                 \n207003 - UINibDecoder UINibDecoder decodeBytesForKey:returnedLength:                   \n207004 - UINibStringIDTable UINibStringIDTable lookupKey:identifier:                   \n207005 - __NSCFConstantString __NSCFString hash    \n...\n. I found I get 'reason: 'This coder requires that replaced objects be returned from initWithCoder:'' sometimes. And not sometimes. I am confused.\n. Tried 2 approaches:\n1. I successed to write KLSwitch as subclass of UISwitch, except a problem that size is fixed to iOS6 UISwitch size.\n2. I failed to object_setClass to replace UI7Switch to KLSwitch. It works on iOS7, but not on iOS6\n. What a genius work :D Please send me a pull request. I will be appreciated  very much.\n. @KieranLafferty Long time passed, but I found proper key to decode values from interface builder. They are UISwitchOn, UISwitchOnTintColor and UISwitchThumbTintColor\n. @KorvinSzanto Added (very) rough implementation of grouped style #8 \n. Thanks. Added to to-to list.\n. @massimobio  Looks great. I will try this. Thanks!\n. Accessories done\n. Thanks updated\n. I should review upper one. About Appirator, UI7Kit does not fit for all the alert view environment yet, unfortunately.\nYou can opt-out @\"UI7AlertView\" to avoid this problem temporary.\nhttps://github.com/youknowone/UI7Kit/blob/master/UI7Kit/UI7KitCore.h#L27\n. Could you share code for Activate, Later alert view? It seems new bug after moving cancel button to bottom.\nAbout Appirater, I have no idea. It looks similar like known 'repeated alert view' problem, but I have no idea how to fix it.\n. Not yet, sorry.\n. Thanks for report. I even didn't noticed there were -s properties. :)\n. @iT0ny The Items bug is fixed\n. By technical issue, UIButton tintColor is not reflected well from InterfaceBuilder, under iOS6 SDK.\nUse iOS7 SDK for best result.\n. Thank you for report. Which version of iOS did you tried?\n. Though I could not represent this problem, I found a hole in UI7View and fixed it.\n. @kovpas ab5b667 fixed it like your patch?\n. @hamadeguchi Thank you for report! I fixed it and released new version.\n. Warning also removed. It will be included in next release.\n. @gribeiro-mobirama Sorry. Because I don't have iPod 4th, I couldn't test this control on it. Could you represent it on simulator? Or show me representable code for that?\n. Unfortunately, I tried this code but didn't get that ugly stroke. (Test code is included current HEAD) But I found you are setting subview's tint colors. UI7Kit is implemented with all other codes, but is not touching subviews. How about try to set entier tint color like:\n[segmentedControl setTintColor:[UIColor redColor]]\nIn your method, it will not change entire color theme but will change only partial parts.\nAbout the stroke, I need more information. Try test app of current HEAD and check the #12 row in main table view. Test code is here: https://github.com/youknowone/UI7Kit/blob/master/UI7KitTestApp/UITIssue12ViewController.m#L30\n. setTintColor: should work well in both OS. But it is fixed in recent days. So you may using unfixed UI7Kit yet. I updated UI7Kit just now. Try updating this.\nIf it still does not work after updating, it is UI7Kit bug. Please let me know it.\n. @gribeiro-mobirama I found iOS7 SDK + Interface Builder + 3.5 inch screen can make this problem. Is this right? I didn't noticed this because i tested all the code from iOS6 SDK.\n. It is iOS7 SDK bug. (Without UI7Kit, it still is broken)\nI think watching next beta is better at this time. If this would not fixed until release of iOS7, I will add a workaround.\n. Interesting information. Thank you @tracid \n. @gribeiro-mobirama @tracid I prevented UISegmentedControl's height become less than 1px. I found this helps problems, at least in some case.\n. Depressing... I may should add constraint in the initWithCoder: for iOS6\n. Finally thumb image is finished by 35fc93f67b4e816edfc4862caa37036ab96f3f07 e322441d9072a6d7f40c60487c4d542ddf188990\n. KLSwitch is imported\n. @iT0ny I tried MBSwitch but it does not work well because of dynamic width issue. I reported it to MBSwitch. https://github.com/mattlawer/MBSwitch/issues/3\nIf you want, you can use it after fixing macro in UI7Switch.m\n. Moved to seven switch and looks fine everything.\n. I am wondering how to change 'Global tint color' in interface builder by code.\nAbout button, could you share problem reproducible test project?\n. [[UIKit kit] setTintColor:[UIColor redColor]] will change it to red\n. Thank you. I will remove this calls soon.\n. Reimplement or renamed methods. We need to search a new way.\n. I am trying to upload an app without this methods\n. From recent review, NSAProperty accessors are confirmed as safe for App Store review.\n. Hi! I finally got (maybe the first) real app with UI7Kit: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id444076697\nReviewd by Apple just some hours ago.\n. Yes, we are. I will try to remove them. Thank you for report.\n. @Lithiums Try 0.9.1. It must be clean\n. Those selectors are removed in 0.9.8\n. @Lithiums I am really happy that no apps are rejected by UI7Kit. Thank you very much :D\n. Great idea. I cannot belieave I never thought about including this as monkey patch target.\n. UI7Font and its patch work now.\n. patch for #4 \n. Great, really great work. Thank you!\n. @viking2009 Theoretically it would be more safe, but actually, they are same. That test is intending not only to test it has onImage selector but also to test it is iOS6 SDK or not. By reference of Apple, they works in same way.\n. KLSwitch is integrated recent day. I will release updated version soon\n. I released 0.0.14 with KLSwitch to cocoapods\n. Manually merged\n. Thanks!\n. I have a question. I found you prefer UIScreen to UIWindow to measure screen size. Any reason or benefit of it? I am not good at these issue. I want to know if it is reasonable or preference. Thanks for recent patches!\n. I retouched some lines.\nI think we cannot assign frame in -show methods. It breaks showing animation. If we want to arrange items to center, we should move up and down all the subviews including backgroundView.\nSo I removed the self.frame part. I think we can calculates total height and set each subviews frame one by one.\n. I didn't fix it. Instead of fixing, I gave up to align it to center.\nAny good idea to changing them before starting animation?\n. @LeoNatan Thank you for the advice. I thought UIAlertView should be shown in the middle of the window. Is this right?\n. Thank you very much! Great hint for implementation.\n. I tried to disable UI7TextField. And UISearchBar is still broken.\n. Oh, sorry. I just removed patching at last time. Category implementaion is the problem. Thanks\n. Temporary removed the overriding. And I found I forgot about UISearchBar! \n. related issue #42 \n. Any unresolved issue?\n. This code removes cancel button in iOS5.\n. Manually fix, rebase & merged to db54b571c519e648f194d3e77c469fd8ebb73b29\n. Manually merged as 908ba4c1e736f27597884038cb3ef32b5646a4e0 after reindent & rebase\n. About UIAlertViewStyleLoginAndPasswordInput, I am seeing it works for simple title, message and 2 buttons. Could you share your code?\n. Your alert view looks fine for me.\n\n. I confirmed even buttons are not rendered either. Because this was pull request, I want to close this request. I think we should creates new issue for this.\n. Opened new issue\n. Great work! Thank you!\n. As I know, it is not UIPickerView redraw for iOS6. See the screenshots.\nInstead of it, I once considered AFPickerView, but it was GPL.\nI think I should reimplement this from UIView.\n. I am sorry but picker view has lower priority yet. Because I think it is very hard to implement a picker view looks like iOS7 one, I just want it looks like flatten designed thiing temporary. I hope I can replace this work with existing library, but didn't tried anything yet.\n. Current rough implementation of UI7PickerLikeView kills UIDatePicker when it is patched.\n. current progress:\n\nI have no idea how to do more.\n. Could you paste 3 commands results to understand this more?\n1. Get the cocoapods version\npod --version\n1. Get the installed cocoapods files. In the project directory,\nfind Pods\n1. Get the error messages with compiler options. In the project directory,\nxcodebuild\n. I found I was using old version of cocoapods. It is solved now. Thank you for reporting!\n. If you met problem again reopen please :)\n. Mmm, ok, how about rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock && pod install?\npod install shows you some warning, if you set wrong your project. If you have any warning, you should fix it first.\n(it may includes warnings about header path)\nOr, if your app is not first target of your project, move your target to first of your project and retry again.\nI think this is cocoapods issue, actually. And these are how I solved it usually.\n. This script works great ;)\n. I removed the seperator because iOS7 action sheet doesn't have seperator bar.\n\n. Oh.. indeed. I found other test with less buttons draw the seperator too.\n. About origin.y, it has origin.y += 20 code in the existing titleLabel if statement. Moving it out of the if statement will fix this. \n. I fixed this. Thank you!\n. This is fixed, except dim view. About dimView, even setHidden: doesn't work. I have no idea.\n. Patch is reverted due to terrible bug on iPhone / iOS6\n. @gribeiro-mobirama Not yet.\n. @gribeiro-mobirama I am sorry. I was totally forgot that I patched the input once. Input works well. Try it.\n. EERRRMMM!! I don't understand how this work like this way. It passes all the patching code but only title is changed.\n. No way at this time. But I think I should add that mechanism. I think more cases will be found in the future.\n. The idea 'suppress patching for configured subclasses' would not work. MFMailComposeViewController is a subclass of UINavigationController. But the bar configuration is set up by UINavigationBar.\n. @thomassnielsen OK. I changed approach. Instead of patching MFMailComposeViewController or exclude MFMailComposeViewController from the patch list, I just patched MFMailComposeViewController to strip patched properties from the navigaion bar.\n. 0.6.2 includes this patch\n. Oops.. terrible mistake\n. Thank you for report!\nAnd @thatsmystapler , Thank you for the patch!\n. @antgly Sorry I forgot to release the update. 0.2 includes it.\n. I installed ShareKit through cocoapods, but got no compiler error. Would you share me the error messages?\n. I fixed precompiled header errors for old cocoapods. Retry again with UI7Kit 0.3.1 and please let me know if problem doesn't become resolved.\n. I guess this can be resolved with cocoapods update or 05f8936ac75efa48623a2a5f07f5010a8ae7f047.\nIf problem is still not solved, please reopen this issue again.\nThank you all!\n. Hi. Would you share me the error log?\n. Thank you.\nI am sorry but I am not sure this is problem of UI7Kit. Your xcode doesn't find NSString from Foundation and this is not a possible error from UI7Kit as I know. When I first installed xcode5, I edited SDK header accidentely and got similar problem.\nTo check the problem concreately, try this things and let me know the result.\n1. Remove UI7Kit from your project and try to build without UI7Kit. - If error still exists, something other problem\n2. If problem is cleared but raised again after attaching UI7Kit, please paste here the header including order of your code, including UI7Kit (maybe only main.m if you followed the instruction)\n. I tried to reproduce the same environment, but uikit-appdelegate-ui7kit doesnt make any problem for my project. I hope to have zipball of entire project directory, but i guess it is not easy for you due to license or nda.\nI have a public project with ui7kit qrqr: https://github.com/youknowone/qrqr\nI wonder you can build this project or not. This helps to know your problem is project-specific problem or environment-specific problem. (in fact, i am not sure what to do next afrer this)\nSorry for not very helpful advices.\n. Oh.. I forgot about the submodule. Sorry for lack of instruction.\nI still guess it is a header including order issue, but not sure. I really want to see the archive of the project. I feel blind now.\nCould you make a minimal project archive, removing sensitive files which should not be public?\n. I fixed precompiled header errors for old cocoapods. Retry again with UI7Kit 0.3.1 and please let me know if problem doesn't become resolved.\n. Thank you about letting me know you solved it.\nI checked current version with cocoapods 0.20.2 works finely. So kind of issues may be reproduced again.\n. This problem will be fixed in next release. By the way, if you want, you can use round-rected flat style button with UI7RoundedRectButton for 'Go' button or 'Favorite Book' button.\n. 0.3 is released\n. Seems related to #43, but no problem here.\nCould you copy the error logs?\n. It looks cocoapod doesnt recognize precompiled header option. What version of cocoapod do you use? you can find it ith 'pod --version'\n. I fixed precompiled header errors for old cocoapods. Retry again with UI7Kit 0.3.1 and please let me know if problem doesn't become resolved.\n. Hi. Would you share me which datasource and delegate did you implement? Basic implementation for 'titleForSection' is supported. But it doesn't seem that case.\n. @emichaud I want UI7Kit replace the UITableView gracefully. So I want to test the library too. Is it http://sensiblecocoa.com/ ?\n. @segiddins Do you also use sinsible cocoa or other table view component?\n. About background, I still am not sure what you mean or what's the expected result for you. At the last time, I thought it was background color. But it doesn't seem like that. If you are saying about background pattern, it is not iOS7-like background. If you have xcode5 preview, try to build it with iOS7 SDK and run it on iOS7 simulator. Screenshots of iOS7 simulator and UI7Kit must be great explaination of the difference.\nAbout the switch problem, new issue may be better. I always appreciate new issue for any unrelated issue. Because I usually forgot issues and reminds them from issue list. :)\n. Oh.. you were talking about the spaces between sections. This is strange... I beleaved this issue was resolved. Would you share me which datasource and delegate did you implement?\n. I fixed background color, but I am not sure what's the problem of the section headers. There is 'UI7KitCatalog' app in the UI7Kit.xcworkspace. It also is a static table view, but has no problem with sections.\n. patch 873fae5 is released. It is confusing that the header looks ok only for me...\n. @Urkman Sorry. I misunderstand the behavior. I remade the background color policy of table view and cell now\n. Sensible table view problem is due to stupid implementatino of UITableView delegate. I should rewrite UI7TableView delegate to solve this problem.\nWorkaround: Use 1 to 1 relation with table view and its delegate.\n. Mmm.. by recent review, I found sensible table view model returns 22.0f for height for section. The expected default behavior is -1 for default height. This could not be solved without special handling for sensible table view\n. 0.9.2 is released with this patch\n. Thank you. For quick fix, Try this temporary workaround:\n[[stepper layer] setBorderColor:[UIColor clearColor].CGColor];\n. In iOS5, border follows transforms. In iOS6, not. hmm.....\n. You should build your app with iOS7 SDK. Because UI7Kit only is enabled on iOS5 or 6, your app built with iOS6 SDK doesnt has appearance of iOS7.\n. I never tested it, but you can try [UI7Kit patch] instead of [UI7Kit patchIfNeeded]. It will patch iOS7 too.\n. I am not sure I should fix [UI7Kit patch] for iOS6 SDK. I will try this if this is an easy problem.\n. I forgot to reference this issue. Thanks to @segiddins , This is solved in 96788d48a6570880fb3d4aeca76a5dca9028a56a .\n. 0.4 is released\n. You missed pod setup after installing cocoapods\n. Because you don't seem to have any problem during a week, I close this issue.\nIf you met same or other problem, please feel free to reopen this issue.\n. @m1entus Hey, it looks great. I didn't use it in this project, but I am trying to use it to another app. Thanks :D\n. 0.9.4 is released with basic support of UI7ActivityViewController theme\n. Great fix!\n. I've merged first commit manually. 86d8fde8b1f722d828788a92815258f47f0ec710\n. 0.4 is released with this patch.\n. I didn't noticed this issue. Next release will come in few hours.\n. 0.4 is released\n. Let me know if you have any problem with Apple :)\n. @Urkman Do you mind if I add your app to https://github.com/youknowone/UI7Kit#apps-using-ui7kit ?\n. Thanks. I added it just now :)\n. I will try this in this weekend. \n. Original issue is resolved in 0.7.2. setOn: issue is splited to #66 \n. Looks great. Thanks for good testing tool. \n. What is the expected behavior in iOS7?\n. I wonder something goes wrong with header processing. 'Duplicate interface definition' error raised only when header has duplicated class. I can say nothing without more information. How did you met this error?\nIf you met this error while compiling Pods, let me know the cocoapods verion (pod --version in terminal)\nIf you met this error while compiling your project, shoe me the precompiled header and all the header include parts of this path. You will see the include path if you click triangle of this error in left side bar.\n. mmm... Why is your project trying to search header from .Trash?\nI hope you check the files one of In file included from ... and one of `Previous definition is here. I need content of these file and path. I think cleaning trash make all happy.\n. I am not sure what's the expected result. About segmented control, see discussion from #12. About images, show me expected result, built with iOS7 SDK without UI7Kit.\n. Because no additional information is given during more than a week, I close this issue. Whenever you have any problem or information of this issue, feel easy to reopen or open any issue.\nThanks!\n. @huadee Unfortunately, I don't speak chinese. Please comment in English if you want to join this thread.\n. I wonder how did it compiled with calling setTableView: without update. But solved anyway :D\n. This is weird. Could you show me the callstack?\n\nSelect the sidebar like screenshot and copy & paste it.\nYou tested with iOS6 SDK + iOS6 simulator, right?\nThanks! :D\n. mm.. I prefer textual copy&paste becasue it has more information. You can copy it with Cmd+C.\nthe UI7TableView in stack 40 and 27 and 1 are same or different?\n. Because other 4 apps with UITableView doesn't have crash problem and sensible table view calls are in your callstack, It seems new feature (accessory support) of UI7Kit conflicts with sensible tableview. I think I should review sensible table view issue. To avoid this problem temporary, comment out the patch line: https://github.com/youknowone/UI7Kit/blob/master/UI7Kit/UI7TableView.m#L103\nThis code is used to fill tint color to your table view cell accessory, so not a big deal.\n. 0.7.5 is released with the fix\n. Reopen #67 . Sorry. I only tested setter part. I should patch getter for that code.\n. Not a UI7Kit issue, close\n. Sorry. I forgot to implement it. 0.7.4 is released now.\n. 0.7.6 is released with this fix.\n. Prompt looks fine / Scope bar looks ugly\n. I have no idea how to make it to normal segmented control :|\n. Oops.. I lost writing comment and it is too sleepy. Saying breif\n1. Dynamic patch is one-pass phase. So it doesn't work anyway\n2. respondsToSelector also doesn't work. The basic work of UI7Kit work is wrapping existing implementaiton of the selector. So it copy the selector to the other name and patch the new implementation to that part.\nI have plain to review Sensible table view. I think something patching process is conflict to what sensible table view does. So i will find a way to avoid the conflict.\nif you want to dig it, i think the good point is not the patching part but the calling part of original method, which make bad access. I am really curious that what sensible table view does that make this conflict ;)\n. Oh, it must be great. Could you send me it to the email?\n. Oops, I thought github shares my emil to you. it is \n. #65 is closed. I found your test app is full of the problems. I am seeing #61 here, also. And even switch width is strange.\n. Switch width is fixed in 0.8.10\n. How did you set your text color? By technical issue, Interface builder color of UIKit with iOS7 SDK under iOS6 cannot load text color. If it is not this case, let me know how to reproduce it. I will check it is bug or technical limitation.\nTo set text color always, set the tintColor of the button.\n. I am sorry for late reply. I fixed this problem (textTitleColor is ignored even if it is set) in 0.7.7 and released it just now.\nThank you for reporting and tips ;)\n. Additional fix in 0.7.8. Use 0.7.8 for dynamic setTitleColor:\n. Your code makes no error itself. (test app issue 71) Could you share me a real code or more specific condition to reproduce this crash?\n. Mmm.. I thought iPad was the reason but it is not BAD_ACCESS\n. No, I found crash on iPad. But when I checked the error message, I found it is not BAD_ACCESS. So different reason.\nI feel hard to create new, working project with your codes. Could you share me zipball of the project (if it is allowed) or create minimal, buildable project to reproduce this issue? I even not sure I can reproduce the problem with this code.\n. Close because it is not reproducable at this time - please reopen this if problem still occurs and can report reproducable environment.\nI am sorry that I coudn't help this problem.\n. Fixed in 0.8.10\n. 0.7.9 is released\n. Duplicated of #77 . This issue was created first, but less discussion. So I close this one. I am sorry for confusing.\n. Since UI7Kit doesn't using ARC, ARC would not be a problem.\ncolorWith8bitRed:green:blue:alpha: is a FoundationExtension selector. Check your project has 'FoundationExtension' and this method exists in it. I think I once changed its name colorWith8BitRed:.. -> colorWith8bitRed: . This may be a problem, but it still seems strange because your multiple reinstalling must make them latest.\nCheck FoundationExtension and its method and let me know. I will think about more issues about it.\n. Static library looks not linked well. There is category extension linking bug in old compilers.\nCheck this points.\n1. Do your app link libPods?\n2. Do your app is compiled by -ObjC compiler option?\n3. Do your app is compiled by recent clang compiler? gcc requires additional linker option link -all_load or -force_load\n. If you feel ok to share zipball of entire project, it must be best hint for this problem. My email is public@youknowone.org\n. It sounds this will be easily solved by cropping the thumb image\n. 0.8.9 is released with cropped image - looks ugly now. I need new image with redrawn shadow\n. #12 has related discussion (still not solved)\nAnd.. it is the Parlance! I tried to build it some days ago, but failed because i couldn't find the way to install all the dependencies.\n. @LeoNatan Thank you for great advice! intrinsicContentSize looks magic key of some of UI7Kit problems. \n. @LeoNatan @steakknife I hope you guys don't try to require patch or writing code for an idea each other. You can suggest anything or try to patch everything, but I hope all of them are from your own good will or contributions - not by forcing or forced ;)\nAnd thank you both to help to solve this issue!\n. 0.8.9 is released\n. If you still have problem after updating, please don't hesitate to reopen this issue anytime :)\n. I didnt' check it yet, but interface builder option of tintcolor maybe ignored, beause it didn't exist under iOS6 SDK.\nI released 0.8.5 and you can set tint color directly, now.\n. If this problem is not solved, please reopen this issue anytime. Thank you for report!\n. Thank you! I tried this app but whenever I click 'create new account', app is blocked. Any idea?\n. iOS6.1\n1. Open Slader\n2. Touch 'Create Account'\nApp doesn't respond anymore\nThe 'Create Account' button is pressed in step 2 and never be popped again.\nIf I wait for some minutes, app is terminated. (i guess network timeout + exception, but not sure)\nAfter reopening, same.\n. I fixed the BlocksKit UIAlertView problem.\n. 0.8.8 is released\n. Thank you for suggestion. Any help available? We should package source+resource for each controls to do this.\n. Mm, sorry. I failed to describe 'help'. I have not enough time to do everything. So I am spending my time to implementing features or fixing bugs as the highest priority. If no one helped to do this job, this will be long-term goal.\n. If I do this as long term job, I will do first 'replacing embedded images to images drawn by code'. This will reduce most of icon size.\n. Welcome!!! :D\nKnown dependencies:\nUI7View -> All\nUI7TableView -> UI7PickerView\nUI7BarButtonItem -> UI7TableViewController\n. 0.8.8 is released with this patch, thanks!\n. Thank you for great support :D\n. I should rewrite delegate part of UI7TableView for this issue. It will not be done very soon, sorry.\n. 0.9.2 is released with this patch\n. I use CALayer for gradient and border radius, nothing other. Actually, I don't know much about CALayers.\nWill you try 0.8 instread of 0.8.7? I changed switch implementation recently and I found many layer accesses in there. \n. If it is switch problem, I will report it to switch implemenation. Else, you can find 'CALayer' and '.layer' as keyword to all the CALayer access of this project. (except dependencies)\n. Thank you for test\n. Oh... what a strangeness. One more test request\nWithout UI7Kit installation, do you have CABasicAnimations problem with installation of only FoundationExtension?\n. It sounds like Foundation or UIKit has that named internal method. I will try to rename it.\nCould you share me any CABasicAnimation test code? I have no experience about it.\n. Thanks!\n. 0.8.12 is released with this fix. Thank you! Without your help, I never found this bug.\n. 0.8.8 is released. Update it :)\n. Awesome! I never though podfile can be described in this clarified way.\n. A github tip: if you push your branch to original pull request branch, the pull request is updated. In this case, push --force make it updated to single recent commit.\nI will merge this after this app is updated and people can use it. I will not forget. Don't worry :)\n. I still cannot 'Create Account' yet\n. Oops, you are right. I didn't consider it. I am doing\n. And 'activate / later' alert view seems fine to me :)\n. Mmm, yep. I am sorry that updated version had regressions \n. I checked it and looks great :D \nI have a question: how did you make the upper toolbar of keyboard that color? issue #61 seems it should be not like that.\n. Hi. I am out so i caanot review this issue now but test app includes both storyboard uipickerview and decoder logs. Most of decoder properties are logged to test app console. uiswitch uses similar implementation.\n. project under UI7KitTestApp is xcode4 project and Storyboard.storyboard also 4.6.3 compatible.\nproject under UI7KitCatalog is xcode5 project and i will move this project to autolayout\n. I tried to switch UI7KitCatalog to xcode5 project, but I am not experiencing crash. Could you share me your test project?\n. In my case, it didn't crash but totally unusable - no click, no scoll etc\n. Please don't close unsolved issue.\n. 0.8.16 fixed no control issue but not alignment\n. 0.8.9 is released\n. I have a question.\nWidth is set by this code:\nMAX(self.frame.size.width, 2 * superCS.width + superCS.height)\nWhere this expression comes from? I treid superCS.width instead of it and found no problem for normal/portrait app. So I want to know which bug case is prevented by this expression.\n. I also am testing storyboard segmented control, but no problem with initial-width.\n. I melt your commits to 1 commit and merged it manually: 9b5c34a18fd66f4dd194f2c185969dec335b542a\nAnd revert width-fixing code - because it caused unexpected behavior with pinning. If you pin left or right side of controls, the width expression make segmented control to expand too much.\n. Though you already bombed your comments, I read it from mailbox.\n1. I cannot see the images, but I forgot about setFrame:, thanks.\n2. Thank you for proposed values - because I tested them based on your code, but I already mentioned what was its problem. We may can find better solution to solve both problem - but I cannot allow obvious bug behavior. Pinning one-side is common action. It should not be broken by patch.\n3. I have my main job and I need to sleep. Even more, you and I have quite different timezone - it means if you have free time, I am not then usually. If you expected 24/7 responsive here, I am sorry. I cannot do it.\nThank you for great helps and I am so sorry to miss you. Your patches were great advances. Good luck for you too.\n. Thank you for many patches!\nWhile reviewing your patch, I tried:\n```\n@implementation SevenSwitch (Patch)\n\n(CGSize)intrinsicContentSize {\n    return CGSizeMake(51.0f, 31.0f);\n}\n\n@end\n```\nAnd worked great for all the iOS5/iOS6 without autolayout and iOS6 with autolayout.\nSo I think 'UI7KIT_HAS_CONSTRAINTS' is not nessessary. Am I right?\n. I fixed it slightly more and manually merged it: e3af9a2148fe41acb65f9924babf0fa828f4c1a2\n. Great. I didn't know that. I copied them if i can access there - like buttons, but nothing others.\n. @LeoNatan It is good advice, but I was already using screen capture of iOS7 to retrieve resources of iOS7.\nAnyway, I exported resources from main repository not to mix licenses.\n. Oops, thank you!\n. iPad support code kills iPad.. thanks :)\n. 0.8.19 is released with workaround\n. 0.8.13 is released. If you stil experience problem, reopen this issue please.\n. Sorry. new 0.8.15 with fix now. I didn't tested it but it will not allow nil object now.\n. Did you checked iOS7 screen of that page? UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailButton is introduced for special usage.\n. Thanks. Could you give me environment hints?\n1. OS version\n2. SDK version\n3. Autolayout usage\n. Would anyone share me bug-reproducable test project?\n. Great! Thanks!\n. Thank you for report. From your report, I found UI7Kit has bug for [composeActionSheet showFromRect:CGRectZero inView:tableview animated:YES];\nWorkaround: Use 'showInView:' to avoid this bug.\nTip: You can paste your code pretty with 4-backquote.\n. 0.8.18 is released with this fix. If you still experience this bug, feel free to reopen this issue.\n. I think I forgot to add protocol. Sorry.\n. Great, and thank for suggesting background color value. I melted your commits to 1 commit and merged it manually. Merge is 79b99cbeb5e7e4cfa384de774b42a213bbf0c60c\n. Your commit is: bf6b7f7be280747fefc6bfd46b3a7842674f3f5d\n. This patch is really good. I doubt I never could imagine shadow was just an option of navigaiton bar.\n. Thank you! looks good!\n. Thank you for great patch!\n. Great! It looks perfect. @segiddins and @iT0ny would be happy too.\n. tag #31 \n. I am sorry that reviewing is delayed. I will check this tonight :)\n. Great. is layoutSubviews make this magic ? :D\n. This patch fix #89 \n. I am sorry about taking over this. I tried it and it works really well.\n. Thank you for report. Could you explain more about last comment? do you mean '?' for blank picker view content?\n. Oh, unfortunately, viewForRow: is not implemented in UI7PickerView yet, sorry.\n. No way to do it yet. I should add viewForRow: support for that.\nI think I should try something first. I will ask things while doing this. Thanks!\n. 1. viewForRow: is supported now - but I am not sure this implementation is similar to UIPickerView\n2. about textColor or selectionIndicatorColor, I found this is also not customizable in UIPickerView. So I implemented it in UI7PickerLIkeView but didnt reveal them to UI7PickerView. I wonder how did you do that in iOS7.\n. About grouped table view, did you remove color of table view in iOS7 or did you remove spaces between section by section? And how did you do that?\n. viewForRow: working example:\n\ncode: https://github.com/youknowone/UI7Kit/blob/master/UI7KitCatalog/UICPickerViewController.m#L71\nNOTE: Text is not visible in iOS7\n. Try 0.9.7. I fixed color problems.\n. I am sorry for late. Time is always running.\nSee commit 1a61f65002e3a451e417ff58ef64e1f9885fb09b\nYou can try it from 0.9.8. If you still are seeing gray background, try to change UIWindow background color to black. (I didn't tested this)\nIf it still fails, edit the values from code as workaround. white:0 alpha:255 will make it perfect black.\n. I wrote a test code but I found no problem. Could you try my test and figure out what's the difference? Test is UI7KitCatalog -> picker view\n. How did you set it to multiline? I am seeing single line for long text too.\n\n. Oh, I found this is only for grouped table view\n. Mm.. Did you tried SDK 6.0 + deployment target 7.0?\n. No, it is my fault. I will fix it soon.\n. welcome :)\n. Looks important idea, but I have no idea to do this easily\n. If its behavior is different from iOS7, it is bug :)\n. Thank you. I always wondered why some apps has unpatched back buttons.\n. Do you want black background of navigation bar?\n. Do you have black background below the navigation bar? Its color is following iOS7 alpha value now\n. I found tabbar/navigationbar default background color is black\nself.tabBarController.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];\n    self.navigationController.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];\nI think this is so confusing.. I have no idea how to set default value of bar color. \n. You use iOS6. It means your table view is not under your navigation bar\n. default bar color is reverted to alpha 255. I should think more about this issue. Thank you for report\n. I've replaced assets to iOS original assets. So it will be ok ;)\n. It seems to be not implemented yet. I am sorry that currently I have no time to review any issue. I will notice in comment for any progress in future.\n. OMG... how clever solution is it.\n. It is sad that this patch didn't fixed #39 \n. Thanks for great patch! Check 0.9.11 for your patch :D\n. Fixed dependency. Retry please :)\n. I am sorry for late. 0.9.12 is released today.\n. Thanks :D\n. 0.9.13 is released with your patch. Thanks!\n. 0.9.13 is released with your patch. Thanks!\n. Thank you! 0.9.14 is released.\n. Great point, Thanks. I can't belieave I never run static analyzer for long time.\n. fixed in 0.9.15\n. UI7PickerView is not a behavior patch but a replacement of implementation. So it doesn't auto-adjust to UIDatePicker. I need to implement it independently.\n. Thanks!\n. released with 0.9.16\n. released 0.9.17 with this patch\n. Thanks! released as 0.9.18\n. Hi. These tables are static table view controllers and I can't figure out the problem you described.\nCould you help me some more?\niOS6 + UI7Kit\n\n\niOS7\n\n\n. See the error message. Because FBTokenInformationExpirationDateKey is not a symbol in UI7Kit, I can't fix it form UI7Kit. I am not sure where it is, but you may miss some library from linking.\n. Thanks for great patch. But could you remove .podspec file from the patch? I think I should release new version of UI7Kit, not a b1 :)\n. Thank you! It's great patch.\n. I am sorry to take long time to release 0.9.19.\nIt is now available via cocoapods\n. Thank you!\n. Updating to cocoapods to recent version working for this issue?\n. Hello.\nBecause I was absense for this project for a while, I don't know well about issues now.\nBecause I recently merged a patch related to the header, I am guessing it is related to new cocoapods version.\nThis issue seems related in backward way: https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2536\nSo I guess updating cocoapods version will fix the problem. How do you think?\n. Thank you! lol\n. My fault. 0.9.20 is released. Now just pod 'UI7Kit' also available.\n. Thanks for fixing :)\nI have a question. How about the color? is it really that color with that alpha? I don't know the behavior, but it seems 0.06 and 1 is very different. Changed one is correct for transperant background behaviors?\n. Oh, it makes sense. Thanks :D\n. ",

    "KieranLafferty": "Hey thats hilarious I came here specifically to offer this to be used in your project. Glad to see someone beat me to it!\n. I forked the repo and got my control to display in place of the UISwitch using your FoundationExtender, I was wondering, how can I make my KLSwitch coding compliant with UISwitch such that it receives the 'onTintColor' and 'on' properties that are specific to UISwitch, any thoughts?\nWhat I tried so far was to manually decode the coder passed to initWithCoder using keys looked up in the storyboard file\n```\ndefine kCodingOnKey @\"on\"\ndefine kCodingOnTintColorKey @\"onColor\"\ndefine kCodingOnColorKey @\"onTintColor\"    //Not implemented\ndefine kCodingTintColorKey @\"tintColor\"\ndefine kCodingThumbTintColorKey @\"thumbTintColor\"\ndefine kCodingOnImageKey @\"onImage\"\ndefine kCodingOffImageKey @\"offImage\"\n\n\n(void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder {\n    [super encodeWithCoder: aCoder];\n[aCoder encodeBool: _on\n            forKey: kCodingOnKey];\n[aCoder encodeObject: _onTintColor\n              forKey: kCodingOnTintColorKey];\n[aCoder encodeObject: _tintColor\n              forKey: kCodingTintColorKey];\n[aCoder encodeObject: _thumbTintColor\n              forKey: kCodingThumbTintColorKey];\n[aCoder encodeObject: _onImage\n              forKey: kCodingOnImageKey];\n[aCoder encodeObject: _offImage\n              forKey: kCodingOffImageKey];\n}\n\n\n(id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder {\n    if (self = [super initWithCoder: aDecoder]) {\n_on = [aDecoder decodeBoolForKey:kCodingOnKey];\n_onTintColor = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: kCodingOnTintColorKey];\n_tintColor = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: kCodingTintColorKey];\n_thumbTintColor = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: kCodingThumbTintColorKey];\n_onImage = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: kCodingOnImageKey];\n_offImage = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: kCodingOffImageKey];\n_onTintColor = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: kCodingOnTintColorKey];\n\n[self configureSwitch];\n\n}\nreturn self;\n}\n```\n\n\nI received the decoder keys for UISwitch using https://github.com/nicklockwood/AutoCoding to list all the NSCoder keys for the class. Here is the list\nonColor,\nonTintColor,\ntintColor,\nthumbTintColor,\nonImage,\noffImage,\non,\nenabledAlpha,\nenabled,\nselected,\nhighlighted,\ncontentVerticalAlignment,\ncontentHorizontalAlignment,\nskipsSubviewEnumeration,\nviewTraversalMark,\nviewDelegate,\nmonitorsSubtree,\nbackgroundColorSystemColorName,\ngesturesEnabled,\ndeliversTouchesForGesturesToSuperview,\nuserInteractionEnabled,\ntag,\nlayer,\n\"_boundsWidthVariable\",\n\"_boundsHeightVariable\",\n\"_minXVariable\",\n\"_minYVariable\",\n\"_internalConstraints\",\n\"_dependentConstraints\",\n\"_constraintsExceptingSubviewAutoresizingConstraints\",\n\"_shouldArchiveUIAppearanceTags\",\nrestorationIdentifier\nMy concern is that decoding the NIB may cause apps to get rejected by the App store for doing some shady things. \n. Also, not able to retrieve values from the NSCoder passed from the storyboard\n. Yea the issue is that the switch inherits from UIControl not from UISwitch. As such the two classes are siblings and KLSwitch does not automatically decode the switch.\nThe alternative would be to inherit from UISwitch and make use of the decoding functionality of UISwitch while hiding the UISwitch view layer. However, this is a pretty hacky solution which would use much more memory for very little functional gain.\nThe best solution would still be to decode them from the NSCoder as that has the details of the runtime vars from the UIStoryboard. Just need to find out why the keys arent workign currently :S \n. What I did in the ui7switch was to use the uo7switch to decode the KlSwitch with the UISwitch decoder passed from storyboard. Sounds confusing but basically it's like this\n(On phone so excuse bad formatting)\n-(id) initwithcoder:(nscoder*) adecoder {\nself = [[KLSwitch alloc] initwithcoder: adecoder];\nIf(self){...}\nReturn self;\n}\nSo basically this allows it to receive all of the storyboard coded attributes for uicontrol (shared parent of UISwitch and KlSwitch) but does not receive the attributes specific to UISwitch (on, tintcolor, etc)\nAlso this sort of feels weird doing it this way there must be a better way \n. So I updated my fork of this to work well with KLSwitch\nThings that work:\n1) Grabs decoded values from UISwitch by instantiating a UISwitch with the coder then grabbing properties and setting them on the KLSwitch\n2) Constrains the frame size to the height of the UISwitch and the standard proportion of the iOS 7 Switch\nFiles changes\nUI7Switch.m\npodfile (had to specify 5.0 in order for compatibility with KLSwitch\nTODO: \nGrab values from IB without having to create a dummy switch to grab the IB configured properties unique to the switch\nLet me know if you want me to create a pull request for this\n. https://github.com/kieranlafferty/UI7Kit\n.

If I recall correctly, this is the same behavior in both iPhone and iPad.\nOn the other hand, UIActionSheet on iPhone opens a private subclass of UIWindow while on iPad it is a private popover controller that is pushed into the view hierarchy.\n. I think the solution to this is implementing -[UIView intrinsicContentSize] and returning the correct bar size.\n. I am not sure which thread is about what, but the above issues, caused by autolayout, has a simple solution, I think.\nI think the solution to this is implementing -[UIView intrinsicContentSize] and returning the correct bar size.\n. Quite a flood there.\nThis is an incorrect fix. If someone adds another height constraint, there would be a conflict.\nUse intrinsicContentSize.\n. I will not have time. Please try my suggestion and see if it helps under projects with autolayout.\n. I have no stake in this project. I will not be using it in my software. I just find the idea behind it interesting and from time to time pop in to suggest fixes. You can take it or leave it. Your attitude is uninviting and obnoxious. Good job.\n. Thank you Jeong, that's good to hear. Keep up the good work!\n. This is a gray area. Opening the artwork file and redistributing content is a copyright violation and risks Apple sending cease and desist letter for the entire project. I think this is an unnecessary risk, you can draw most of the stuff yourself.\n. These properties are used primarily for translucent views. Seeing as how UI7Kit does not introduce translucent navigation bars and toolbars, their requirement is moot. Moreover, implementing \"automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets\" alone would be a difficult feat, one that may require private API.\n. ",

Hi,\nI not updated UI7Kit to 0.3.2, same problem. It fails in building PODs, not when building the real App. :-) could it be incompatibility to other PODs?\nThanks\n-Jan\n.

For example, the back button :\nUIImage *backImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"UI7NavigationBarBackButton\"];\n    backImage = [backImage imageByFilledWithColor:tintColor];\n    [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:backImage forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];\n    backImage = [backImage imageByFilledWithColor:tintColor];\n    [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:backImage forState:UIControlStateHighlighted barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];\nI've got my tint color defined above and I also import #import \"UIImage.h\"\nimport \"UI7Color.h\".\nThis is definitely only recommended if you are really having back button issues.\n.

    "gilthonweapps": "I have to add that the pickerView is only filled with ??? instead of the numbers.\n. Hi. I use the pickerView to select a time. So, with iOS 7, each part of the pickerView contains numbers from 0 to 9. But with iOS 6, each number is replaced by a '?'.\nHere is the code I am using (I removed some parts of the function that are not useful to describe the problem):\n- (UIView )pickerView:(UIPickerView )pickerView viewForRow:(NSInteger)row forComponent:(NSInteger)component reusingView:(UIView )view\n  {\n  UILabel tView = (UILabel*)view;\n  if (!tView) {\n      tView = [[UILabel alloc] init];\n      tView.textColor = [UIColor redColor];\n      tView.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%d\", row];\n  }\nreturn tView;\n  }\n. That's sad. I am using it to be able to change the color of the text of each component of the pickerView. Is there another way to do it?\nDo you have any comments on my other issues?\nTell me if you need more information.\n. Ok great. Feel free to ask ;-)\n. I have updated my app with the latest version of your code and the pickerView is now empty.\nIn order to change the color of the text, just have a look at my sample code. As you provide the viewForRow method with a custom view (in my case, a UILabel), you specify the color with the UILabel textColor method.\nConcerning selectionIndicatorColor, it is black by default in iOS7, that's why we don't see it in my example as the background of my view is black.\n. Concerning the grouped table view, here is how I configure it:\n\n. I managed to make the pickerView work. I just needed to set a frame to the UILabel I created in the viewForRow method. Thanks.\nNow, I still would like to have the color of the separator in black (default color).\n. If I use the selectRow:inComponent:animated method of the pickerView (configured with the viewForRow), I have this behaviour:\n\nIn my code, I selected 10:16 and you can see the picker is not properly selected.\n. I have tested 0.9.7. Some issues have been fixed, thank you :-)\nHere are issues with GroupedTableView:\niOS6\n\niOS7\n\nAs you can see, there is a missing separator line under the title of the section. And the space between the title of the section and the first row of the section is too big.\nAnother problem is for UITableViewCell.accessoryType. If you select UITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark, the checkmark is black. It should be blue by default.\nConcerning the pickerView, I still have the issue mentioned above (the rows not properly selected). I know that this controller is quite difficult to make and I appreciate all the efforts you have already made :-)\nYou don't have any idea on how to set the color of the navigationBar for the whole app?\n. Hi. Thanks for all the modifications.\nDid you have time to look at my issue with grouped tableview explained above and the one with the pickerview not selecting properly values?\nIf you need more info, please tell me.\nAfter that, everything will be perfect! :-)\n. Hi. I made some tests again and think I figured out what was wrong.\nConcerning my issue with the pickerView, I saw that I was selecting the date in the viewDidLoad. If I do it in the viewDidAppear, it works well. So, this problem is solved.\nConcerning the grouped tableview, the extra space (see my screenshot above) is only visible when I use the method - (UIView )tableView:(UITableView )tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section\nPlease note, that in fact the extra space should be above the title and not under.\nThe top separator of the first cell of a section is not showing.\nFor your information, I am not using Storyboard in my app :-)\nThanks again for your help\n.
