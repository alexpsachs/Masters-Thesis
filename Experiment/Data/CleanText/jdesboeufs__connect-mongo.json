Just pushed version 0.1.5 with fixes to avoid race condition, please try it and let me know. I can't reproduce this issue on my end.\n. You shouldn't have to pass an actual DB instance in MongoStore options, it should just be the db name. Does it work for you with just the db name with the latest connect-mongo version?\n.

Will look into this, thanks\n. I can't seem to reproduce the CPU issue, I get 'Error connecting to database' immediately after trying to connect.

Thanks!\n. Thanks! I'll take a look at this ASAP\n. This is a bad idea. What if both apps write to the session at the same time?\n. Consider this scenario:\n1. Server A reads the session data\n2. Server B reads the session data\n3. Server A adds key foo\n4. Server B adds key bar\n5. Server A writes the session data\n6. Server B writes the session data\n7. You have lost the foo key.\n. The same problem applies though, one can erase the addition of the other:\n1. Server A reads the session data\n2. Server B reads the session data\n3. Server A adds key mydomain1\n4. Server B adds key mydomain2\n5. Server A writes the session data\n6. Server B writes the session data\n7. You have lost the mydomain1 key.\n. Sure, when you guarantee that you will never have more than one concurrent request for a particular user across all servers that would be sharing this session, then it works. However, you cannot guarantee that, and so it doesn't work. MongoDB does not have transactions, so you cannot even detect the failure case in a reliable way.\n. You would also have to make sure that the cookie secret was shared between the node apps, or else they won't be able to correctly read the data.\n\nI still wouldn't recommend going this, because inevitably a user will visit both sites at once and there will be data loss.\n.

New version has been published! Sorry for the long wait guys. I'll try to keep up with pull requests on this project. \n\n@outrightmental I'd be happy to pass the maintainer baton on to you for this project if you'd like!\n. Ideally something should run periodically and prune dead sessions from the database.\n. I would suggest looking at the user agent of the request and skipping the session middleware if you do not want to create a session for them. However, I highly recommend expiring sessions. If you do not expire them, then as time goes to infinity, your session storage also goes to infinity.\n. How is that so\n. To solve that I would suggest implementing a password reset feature, via email. The fact is that if you never expire sessions, they are going to accumulate.\n. Isn't the real problem here that ensureIndex can be called before the connection is established? Shouldn't the fix be to push _get_collection callbacks onto an array and then flush them once the connection is established?\n. My personal preference is that defaults would be immutable\n. Hi guys! I'm very much alive, but haven't had time to work on this as I have moved away from using node.js for my projects.

New version has been published! Sorry for the long wait guys. I'll try to keep up with pull requests on this project. \n\n@outrightmental I'd be happy to pass the maintainer baton on to you for this project if you'd like!\n. Ideally something should run periodically and prune dead sessions from the database.\n. I would suggest looking at the user agent of the request and skipping the session middleware if you do not want to create a session for them. However, I highly recommend expiring sessions. If you do not expire them, then as time goes to infinity, your session storage also goes to infinity.\n. How is that so\n. To solve that I would suggest implementing a password reset feature, via email. The fact is that if you never expire sessions, they are going to accumulate.\n. Isn't the real problem here that ensureIndex can be called before the connection is established? Shouldn't the fix be to push _get_collection callbacks onto an array and then flush them once the connection is established?\n. My personal preference is that defaults would be immutable\n. Hi guys! I'm very much alive, but haven't had time to work on this as I have moved away from using node.js for my projects. If someone would like to take over as maintainer of this repo I'd be happy to consider that!\n. You've been added!\n.

We're modifying session.cookie itself, instead of copying it before changing that value. The stringify/parse solution works, but we could also copy its properties to a new object ala _.extend. I'll look into this.\n@fabriziomoscon Right, connect/cookie has a getter on cookie.data, and toJSON() essentially calls that getter by returning this.data.

Since v0.5.0 MongoStore take care of that.\nAnd callback in constructor has been removed ;)\n. I don't know. @techjeffharris is using ~0.4.1 -> 0.4.2.\nBut if you are right, this issue may have been fixed with 0.5.0.\n. @malixsys Using a callback must now be avoided since connect-mongo will wait for the database connection.\n\n@techjeffharris You can upgrade to 0.5.3, mongoose support has been improved and I need feedback :)\n.

I think we can consider this project is abandonned.\nHope its author is alive!\nFork?\n. Maybe it's time for a kind of convergence with similar projects?\nIs connect-mongostore ahead of connect-mongo?\n. Sure, for those using mongoose and express ;)\nFor my projects using them, I use a basic mongoose model with a wrapper, very similar to mongoose-session.\nCurrent code is compatible with Express and Connect.\nThere is no perfect strategy but it seems acceptable to support both mongodb-native and mongoose.\nDay is over in France. Good night! ;)\n. Ok! @kcbanner can you add me as a collaborator of this repository?\nThere are many things to do if we want to keep this project alive.\n. @techjeffharris Can you develop your problem in an issue? :)\n@kcbanner Thanks! I'll do my best.\n. Obsolete.\n. I need more informations!\nYou should submit a new issue.\n. To support connect 3.x is clearly the next step.\nFor now, I'm trying to clean issues and PR.\n. A problem with TTL index?\n. This lib depends on mongodb which depends on components built with node-gyp.\nYour problem is not directly related to connect-mongo so you should get a ride on TooTallNate/node-gyp#168.\nGood luck!\n. I'm working on it! ;)\n. FYI : https://github.com/aheckmann/muri\n. I don't know. ;)\nBut I'm not planning to parse connection strings in connect-mongo. I prefer let this to mongodb.MongoClient.\nI will release a preview version before the weekend.\n. Yeah.\n- options.url [+ options.mongoOptions] => passthrough to mongodb.MongoClient\n- options.mongoose_connection => re-use existing connection\n- options.db (native mongodb.Db) => open new connection or re-use existing one\n- Sugar options to build options.url (host, port, ssl, username, password)\n. Ok it's just devDependencies ;)\n. stringify should be stronger than serialize and unserialize functions in my mind.\nCan you find a way to extract cookie behavior from defaultSerializer? I think it would be easier to implement its own serializer/unserializer couple without that.\nThanks.\n. I don't understand the improvement. Can you explain?\nA named function + a condition block + a try/catch block seems a hard way ;)\n. If I merge your other PR #136 you will be able to implement your own behavior?\nI understand we must choose between #136 et #137 ;)\n. Ok! We must rethink the way connect-mongo deals with errors...\nCan you try to trace the error which happen?\n. For now the job is to fix issues and clean code, without breaking things.\nAs connect-mongo is a very little component, we must be reasonable with dependencies.\nWe use MongoClient from mongodb, introduced in version 1.2, and some Db APIs which are stable since version 0.9.\ndebug is a very stable library, particularly for the basic usage we have.\n. Your problem is not related to connect-mongo.\nYou should use a passport callback and call directly MongoStore.destroy(sid, callback).\n. A session is set even if the user is not authenticated.\nWhile a user is logged in, passport put some data in the current session.\nWhen the user go out, passport cleans those data, but let the session.\nBut if needed, you can manually destroy the current session:\n- Add option unset: 'destroy' in your session middleware constructor\n- Update your logout code:\njs\napp.get('/logout', function(req, res) {\n    req.logout();\n    req.session = null;\n    res.redirect('/');\n});\n. connect-mongo accept db option as a String or as a mongodb.Db instance.\nIt's well documented in the Readme.\nFYI, mongoose expose a mongodb.Db instance through mongoose.connection.db.\n. Thanks ;)\n. I don't know how these pages are generated.\nI asked to @kcbanner if we could avoid gh-pages.\nHaving a dedicated website is not really useful, and not hype anymore ;)\nDo you agree?\n. gh-pages are now disabled!\nWe have now a sexy 404 error page ;)\n@ilanbiala Don't hesitate to make changes on the doc!\n@kcbanner We count on you to drop the url and update the description to:\n\nMongoDB session store for Connect and Express\n\n:)\n. Next big improvements may be:\n- ~~Ensure we support Express 5.0~~\n- ~~Support upcoming native MongoDB driver 2.0~~\n- Support upcoming Mongoose 4.0\n- ~~Support Node.js 0.11~~\n- Support Node.js 0.12 and why not io.js\n- Support koa/session\n- Contribute to expressjs/session\n- Rewrite tests\n- Improve code quality\n- ...\nBut above all, we need to collect feedback from developers.\nDuring the last months, connect-mongo has been removed from many bootstraping / open-source projects, and the repository has now competitors.\nI think we don't want to write additional features \"just for fun\". We want users.\n. Yes!\n. Hi,\nWhat is your connect-mongo version?\nHave you an Exception for us?\n. First, you should upgrade to connect-mongo 0.5.2.\n. req.session doesn't have a destroy() method.\nThe method you found is only exposed to the middleware express-session.\nYou should read my last comment in #140, it may be your answer ;)\n. There is a big mistake in my previous message:\nreq.session has a destroy() method!\nNew version 0.5.3 fixes your problem ;)\n. mongoose.connect() return a Mongoose instance and not a Connection instance.\nYou must choose between basic usage and advanced usage in our Readme, but not mix them.\n. I need more informations.\n. What do you mean when you say that?\n\nthis code breaks my app and nothing after this middleware gets run\n. The middleware is waiting for the connection...\nMaybe there is an error to catch.\n. Can you submit a test which reproduce your problem?\n. As you want.\nYou describe a very basic usage, exactly the same I use in production, so I'm a bit confused.\n. Your code is complicated.\nconnect-mongo is natively able to wait for the connection.\n\nBut if you still want to keep this logic, just replace db.connection by mongoose.connection.\nYour db variable must equal to undefined.\n. Can you console.log() the value of db.connection.readyState, inside your callback?\n. I'm not able to reproduce your problem.\nCan you write a regular test or submit a small codebase in a GitHub repo?\n. 4.0.0-rc1 is supported ;)\nI've updated all the things.\n. If you don't rely on mongoose, connect-mongo will throw an exception which may crash your app.\nIf the server connection is disrupted and autoReconnect is true, try again!\nOtherwise you have a problem :D\nI'll fix this issue as soon as possible.\n. Yes!\n. Since v1.0.0 is upcoming, I close this issue.\nFeel free to create a new one if the problem stay.\n.

The feature you describe, session.touch(), already work if resave: true.\n\nBut yes, express-session 1.10.1 introduces a new API store.touch(), to force touching even if resave is set to false.\nSo let's go ;)\n. I can't add tests and release today.\nHave fun with master branch :)\n. Thx!\n. Thx ;)\nNew version published!\n. Interesting but very advanced feature!\nMaybe you should prefer touchAfter which seems more consistent.\nTo release I need tests and documentation ;)\n. Fixed by #154.\n. Your first middleware is useless since connect-mongo already waits for connection.\nAnd above all, it is badly designed.\nWhen you declare a middleware, it will be used on each request. But when you call session() which effectively returns a middleware, the content of your first middleware has not been called yet.\n. Each connect-mongo deals with one db connection.\nI think you should try another design, or another tool.\n. Some notes:\n- touch() method is no more a simple \"touch\", it resaves all the session\n- lastModified should not be included in the session object but at the document level, so we don't have to provide specific serialize/unserialize functions\n- As touchAfter is a very advanced feature, I think we don't want a large explanation in the README with is become too big since 0.5 and 0.6.\n- Lint errors must be fixed before :)\n. Ok great!\n. I've just updated your code to set touchAfter option in seconds, which is consistent with the ttl option.\n. Published!\nLe mar. 24 mars 2015 \u00e0 21:56, Buu Nguyen notifications@github.com a\n\u00e9crit :\n\nPlease release this as the documentation has been updated. I've been\ndebugging as touchAfter doesn't work at all even though I followed the\ndocumentation to the letter. Turn out it's not on NPM yet.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo/pull/154#issuecomment-85687836\n.\n. Dropping test support = Dropping support\nBe sure I will not break compatibility for my pleasure :)\n. And if a developer want to store a lastModified property in the session? :)\n. Can you give us some details? (MongoDB version, configuration, mongoose version, driver version, Node.js version...)\n. https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo#remove-expired-sessions\nYou have the choice!\n. I need more informations: options used, versions...\n. Can you check if the TTL index has been set?\nIf yes, you have a problem with MongoDB.\n. $ mongo\n$ use yourDb\n$ db.sessions.getIndexes()\n\nAnd copy/paste the result!\n. Most of the connection strategies are not tested yet :(\nI think the problem is related to node-mongodb-native 2.0.\n. I'm on it.\n. How can we detect the state of this existing Db instance in mongodb driver 2.0?\n. Your connect-mongo is too old!\n. You should use this:\njs\nvar mongoStore = new MongoStore({\n    mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection\n});\n. ASAP!\nI want to fix these connection issues and release right after.\nMaybe tomorrow.\n. On my local mac it works too but not on a production environment.\nI looked into mongodb code, and it appears that the connection is not really established when we call connectionReady.\nWe have to find another way to detect these connection/connection states.\n. This warning is not related to connect-mongo but to express-session or early version of connect.\nSo I close this issue :)\n. Did you find a solution?\n. Probably an uncaught exception somewhere...\nDid you call mongoose.connect() before padding mongoose.connection?\n. You should test with upcoming v1.0.0, on master branch.\nI'm ready to re-open the issue if the problem occur again.\n. The get interface must be used with the identifier generated by connect-mongo, not by your custom one.\nI think your attribute sessionid duplicates internal _id.\n. You are free to submit a PR for that :)\nI've no time to investigate the problem for now, but connect-mongo has diverged since many months.\nCan you try to pass a TingoDB Db instance to connect-mongo db option?\n. The problem may have been fixed in upcoming version (1.0.0).\n. TingoDB is not officially supported by connect-mongo.\nIf someone want to fix that, I'll be happy to accept a PR.\n. @CodeLenny It will be fixed in 1.3.2. I'm publishing it right now!\n. connect-mongo doesn't use mongoose abstraction layer.\nBut you can try something like this:\njs\nmongoose.connection.db.collection('sessions').find(...)\n. What is mongoDb.client in your code?\n. Yes it is intended since the session id is initially created by express-session, which is independent from MongoDB.\nThis session id can also be hashed by connect-mongo (optional), so there is no way to turn back to an ObjectId, which is more predictable.\n. I think the eventEmitters option is too much.\nCan you quickly adapt your PR to directly emit events?\nI want to release a final version 0.9.0 asap, and start working on a 1.0.0, dropping mongodb 1.2, node.js 0.8 et old connect and express versions.\n. Ok I'll just drop your two last commits!\n. Merged!\n. Thx!\nI'm back ;)\n. It will break node.js 0.8 support ;)\nI can merge this in a \"next\" branch, which prefigure the upcoming v1.0.0, or you add a simple test to detect if unref() exists.\n. Yeah!\n. You can drop it!\nLe mar. 14 juil. 2015 \u00e0 23:31, Behcet notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nNot sure if this file is required anymore at all since package.json\ndefines main as \"./lib/connect-mongo\"\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo/pull/190#issuecomment-121396446\n.\n. Done.\n. Hi,\n\nYour problem concerns express-session above all.\nconnect-mongo is completely unable to create a new session id.\nTry to set saveUninitialized to false.\nIn your use case you should also remove db, autoReconnect and touchAfter options.\n. Ok.\nTry to submit your problem here and please reference this issue ;)\n. Hi,\nYou can enable the debug mode prefixing the node command with DEBUG=connect-mongo.\nThere is one big problem in your code: the callback has no chance to be called!\nThe second argument of MongoStore creation has been dropped since v0.5.0.\nBut you can emulate an equivalent behavior like that:\njs\n(new MongoStore({ ... })).on('connected', function () {});\nCurrent versions of connect-mongo are able to manage their connection state internally, so this callback is completely optional today.\nHope it helps.\n. On which connection strategy?\n. Connection options must be passed into mongoOptions key.\nserver, username, password and auto_reconnect aren't valid options for constructor.\n. And above all, the connection callback in the constructor doesn't exist anymore (since 0.5.0).\n. All connection options available can be found here: https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html\nContent of mongoOptions will be passed to the MongoClient constructor.\n. Can i close?\n. kerberos in an optional dependency.\nconnect-mongo -> mongodb -> mongodb-core -> kerberos.\nThe problem is not related to connect-mongo. Are you sure the installation failed?\nMaybe it's just a warning.\n. Ok it's not related to connect-mongo.\nconnect-flash should be fixed to ensure session has been saved (whatever the session store used).\n. I'm back!\nI need tests to accept this, and a README update.\nI'll release 0.9 right now and 1.0 in the following days so be patient and submit a new PR ;)\n. I need test. Sorry for that, and the delay.\n. See #194 \n. There is no concept of user in connect-mongo.\nBut if you save a property user in the session, you can easily write a remove request through the MongoDB driver.\nExample:\njs\ndb.sessions.remove({ 'session.user': VALUE });\n. You will need to set stringify option to false.\n. @jmcollin78: The db instance is accessible through store.db.\n@Madhu94: You can't set any default attribute in the constructor.\nYou have to execute your own request if you want to interact with an hypothetic user attribute.\n. Thank you!\nI will release v1.0.0 before the end of the week.\n. No problem with code coverage ;)\n. Fixed in d09953c4a1ab8ee49c211b472fd9d03f0859932a.\nLanding ;)\n. Fixed in 1.0.0.\nGive me your feedback ;)\n. Fixed in 1.0.0.\n. Maybe this?\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo#remove-expired-sessions\n.

No compatibility issue!\nIt's just a mongodb optional dependency which fail to build...\nAs it's not directly related to connect-mongo, if you want (and you should) to improve that output, please warn mongodb package maintainers.\n. Can you eventually add a small test for the existence of this.db?\n. Any idea?\n. Hi,\nThe MongoStore emits some events: at least set, touch, destroy. It's more appropriate than your workaround ;)\nBut it could be useful to know when a session ID is persisted for the first time.\nThe rawResponse returned by the upsert may help in this case. We must investigate.\n. @james-s-turner Session creation hook has been added.\n. autoRemove: false.\nThen you can define your own cleanup tasks.\nYou just have to query the session collection with { expires: { $lt: new Date() } }.\nIf you find an elegant and efficient way to collect expiring session ids, I'll be happy to accept your PR.\n. Yes of course. I've updated the README.md.\n. ?\n. TingoDB is not officially supported by connect-mongo.\nIf someone want to fix that, I'll be happy to accept a PR.\n. Yes!\n. Ok thx!\n. Can you just explain why it produces a different behavior?\nThx!\n. Published as v1.2.1. Thx!!\n. connect-mongo just exposes some basic accessors to express-session.\nIf you have issues with resave: false you must investigate on the express-session side.\n. Fixed in upcoming 1.3.2.\n. Feel free to add NeDB or TingoDB support :)\nI close this issue for now..

A session is set even if the user is not authenticated.\nWhile a user is logged in, passport put some data in the current session.\nWhen the user go out, passport cleans those data, but let the session.\nBut if needed, you can manually destroy the current session:\n- Add option unset: 'destroy' in your session middleware constructor\n- Update your logout code:\njs\napp.get('/logout', function(req, res) {\n    req.logout();\n    req.session = null;\n    res.redirect('/');\n});\n. connect-mongo accept db option as a String or as a mongodb.Db instance.\nIt's well documented in the Readme.\nFYI, mongoose expose a mongodb.Db instance through mongoose.connection.db.\n. Thanks ;)\n. I don't know how these pages are generated.\nI asked to @kcbanner if we could avoid gh-pages.\nHaving a dedicated website is not really useful, and not hype anymore ;)\nDo you agree?\n. gh-pages are now disabled!\nWe have now a sexy 404 error page ;)\n@ilanbiala Don't hesitate to make changes on the doc!\n@kcbanner We count on you to drop the url and update the description to:\n\nMongoDB session store for Connect and Express\n\n:)\n. Next big improvements may be:\n- ~~Ensure we support Express 5.0~~\n- ~~Support upcoming native MongoDB driver 2.0~~\n- Support upcoming Mongoose 4.0\n- ~~Support Node.js 0.11~~\n- Support Node.js 0.12 and why not io.js\n- Support koa/session\n- Contribute to expressjs/session\n- Rewrite tests\n- Improve code quality\n- ...\nBut above all, we need to collect feedback from developers.\nDuring the last months, connect-mongo has been removed from many bootstraping / open-source projects, and the repository has now competitors.\nI think we don't want to write additional features \"just for fun\". We want users.\n. Yes!\n. Hi,\nWhat is your connect-mongo version?\nHave you an Exception for us?\n. First, you should upgrade to connect-mongo 0.5.2.\n. req.session doesn't have a destroy() method.\nThe method you found is only exposed to the middleware express-session.\nYou should read my last comment in #140, it may be your answer ;)\n. There is a big mistake in my previous message:\nreq.session has a destroy() method!\nNew version 0.5.3 fixes your problem ;)\n. mongoose.connect() return a Mongoose instance and not a Connection instance.\nYou must choose between basic usage and advanced usage in our Readme, but not mix them.\n. I need more informations.\n. What do you mean when you say that?\n\nthis code breaks my app and nothing after this middleware gets run\n. The middleware is waiting for the connection...\nMaybe there is an error to catch.\n. Can you submit a test which reproduce your problem?\n. As you want.\nYou describe a very basic usage, exactly the same I use in production, so I'm a bit confused.\n. Your code is complicated.\nconnect-mongo is natively able to wait for the connection.\n\nBut if you still want to keep this logic, just replace db.connection by mongoose.connection.\nYour db variable must equal to undefined.\n. Can you console.log() the value of db.connection.readyState, inside your callback?\n. I'm not able to reproduce your problem.\nCan you write a regular test or submit a small codebase in a GitHub repo?\n. 4.0.0-rc1 is supported ;)\nI've updated all the things.\n. If you don't rely on mongoose, connect-mongo will throw an exception which may crash your app.\nIf the server connection is disrupted and autoReconnect is true, try again!\nOtherwise you have a problem :D\nI'll fix this issue as soon as possible.\n. Yes!\n. Since v1.0.0 is upcoming, I close this issue.\nFeel free to create a new one if the problem stay.\n. The feature is already implemented!\nLe mer. 21 janv. 2015 \u00e0 18:43, Rafael Cardoso notifications@github.com a\n\u00e9crit :\n\nThere are plans to implement Session.touch() interface?\nI'm really enjoying this middleware but I need to use this feature.\nReference: https://github.com/expressjs/session#sessiontouch\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo/issues/149.\n. The feature you describe, session.touch(), already work if resave: true.\n\nBut yes, express-session 1.10.1 introduces a new API store.touch(), to force touching even if resave is set to false.\nSo let's go ;)\n. I can't add tests and release today.\nHave fun with master branch :)\n. Thx!\n. Thx ;)\nNew version published!\n. Interesting but very advanced feature!\nMaybe you should prefer touchAfter which seems more consistent.\nTo release I need tests and documentation ;)\n. Fixed by #154.\n. Your first middleware is useless since connect-mongo already waits for connection.\nAnd above all, it is badly designed.\nWhen you declare a middleware, it will be used on each request. But when you call session() which effectively returns a middleware, the content of your first middleware has not been called yet.\n. Each connect-mongo deals with one db connection.\nI think you should try another design, or another tool.\n. Some notes:\n- touch() method is no more a simple \"touch\", it resaves all the session\n- lastModified should not be included in the session object but at the document level, so we don't have to provide specific serialize/unserialize functions\n- As touchAfter is a very advanced feature, I think we don't want a large explanation in the README with is become too big since 0.5 and 0.6.\n- Lint errors must be fixed before :)\n. Ok great!\n. I've just updated your code to set touchAfter option in seconds, which is consistent with the ttl option.\n. Published!\nLe mar. 24 mars 2015 \u00e0 21:56, Buu Nguyen notifications@github.com a\n\u00e9crit :\n\nPlease release this as the documentation has been updated. I've been\ndebugging as touchAfter doesn't work at all even though I followed the\ndocumentation to the letter. Turn out it's not on NPM yet.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo/pull/154#issuecomment-85687836\n.\n. Dropping test support = Dropping support\nBe sure I will not break compatibility for my pleasure :)\n. And if a developer want to store a lastModified property in the session? :)\n. Can you give us some details? (MongoDB version, configuration, mongoose version, driver version, Node.js version...)\n. https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo#remove-expired-sessions\nYou have the choice!\n. I need more informations: options used, versions...\n. Can you check if the TTL index has been set?\nIf yes, you have a problem with MongoDB.\n. $ mongo\n$ use yourDb\n$ db.sessions.getIndexes()\n\nAnd copy/paste the result!\n. Most of the connection strategies are not tested yet :(\nI think the problem is related to node-mongodb-native 2.0.\n. I'm on it.\n. How can we detect the state of this existing Db instance in mongodb driver 2.0?\n. Your connect-mongo is too old!\n. You should use this:\njs\nvar mongoStore = new MongoStore({\n    mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection\n});\n. ASAP!\nI want to fix these connection issues and release right after.\nMaybe tomorrow.\n. On my local mac it works too but not on a production environment.\nI looked into mongodb code, and it appears that the connection is not really established when we call connectionReady.\nWe have to find another way to detect these connection/connection states.\n. This warning is not related to connect-mongo but to express-session or early version of connect.\nSo I close this issue :)\n. Did you find a solution?\n. Probably an uncaught exception somewhere...\nDid you call mongoose.connect() before padding mongoose.connection?\n. You should test with upcoming v1.0.0, on master branch.\nI'm ready to re-open the issue if the problem occur again.\n. The get interface must be used with the identifier generated by connect-mongo, not by your custom one.\nI think your attribute sessionid duplicates internal _id.\n. You are free to submit a PR for that :)\nI've no time to investigate the problem for now, but connect-mongo has diverged since many months.\nCan you try to pass a TingoDB Db instance to connect-mongo db option?\n. The problem may have been fixed in upcoming version (1.0.0).\n. TingoDB is not officially supported by connect-mongo.\nIf someone want to fix that, I'll be happy to accept a PR.\n. @CodeLenny It will be fixed in 1.3.2. I'm publishing it right now!\n. connect-mongo doesn't use mongoose abstraction layer.\nBut you can try something like this:\njs\nmongoose.connection.db.collection('sessions').find(...)\n. What is mongoDb.client in your code?\n. Yes it is intended since the session id is initially created by express-session, which is independent from MongoDB.\nThis session id can also be hashed by connect-mongo (optional), so there is no way to turn back to an ObjectId, which is more predictable.\n. I think the eventEmitters option is too much.\nCan you quickly adapt your PR to directly emit events?\nI want to release a final version 0.9.0 asap, and start working on a 1.0.0, dropping mongodb 1.2, node.js 0.8 et old connect and express versions.\n. Ok I'll just drop your two last commits!\n. Merged!\n. Thx!\nI'm back ;)\n. It will break node.js 0.8 support ;)\nI can merge this in a \"next\" branch, which prefigure the upcoming v1.0.0, or you add a simple test to detect if unref() exists.\n. Yeah!\n. You can drop it!\nLe mar. 14 juil. 2015 \u00e0 23:31, Behcet notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nNot sure if this file is required anymore at all since package.json\ndefines main as \"./lib/connect-mongo\"\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo/pull/190#issuecomment-121396446\n.\n. Done.\n. Hi,\n\nYour problem concerns express-session above all.\nconnect-mongo is completely unable to create a new session id.\nTry to set saveUninitialized to false.\nIn your use case you should also remove db, autoReconnect and touchAfter options.\n. Ok.\nTry to submit your problem here and please reference this issue ;)\n. Hi,\nYou can enable the debug mode prefixing the node command with DEBUG=connect-mongo.\nThere is one big problem in your code: the callback has no chance to be called!\nThe second argument of MongoStore creation has been dropped since v0.5.0.\nBut you can emulate an equivalent behavior like that:\njs\n(new MongoStore({ ... })).on('connected', function () {});\nCurrent versions of connect-mongo are able to manage their connection state internally, so this callback is completely optional today.\nHope it helps.\n. On which connection strategy?\n. Connection options must be passed into mongoOptions key.\nserver, username, password and auto_reconnect aren't valid options for constructor.\n. And above all, the connection callback in the constructor doesn't exist anymore (since 0.5.0).\n. All connection options available can be found here: https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html\nContent of mongoOptions will be passed to the MongoClient constructor.\n. Can i close?\n. kerberos in an optional dependency.\nconnect-mongo -> mongodb -> mongodb-core -> kerberos.\nThe problem is not related to connect-mongo. Are you sure the installation failed?\nMaybe it's just a warning.\n. Ok it's not related to connect-mongo.\nconnect-flash should be fixed to ensure session has been saved (whatever the session store used).\n. I'm back!\nI need tests to accept this, and a README update.\nI'll release 0.9 right now and 1.0 in the following days so be patient and submit a new PR ;)\n. I need test. Sorry for that, and the delay.\n. See #194 \n. There is no concept of user in connect-mongo.\nBut if you save a property user in the session, you can easily write a remove request through the MongoDB driver.\nExample:\njs\ndb.sessions.remove({ 'session.user': VALUE });\n. You will need to set stringify option to false.\n. @jmcollin78: The db instance is accessible through store.db.\n@Madhu94: You can't set any default attribute in the constructor.\nYou have to execute your own request if you want to interact with an hypothetic user attribute.\n. Thank you!\nI will release v1.0.0 before the end of the week.\n. No problem with code coverage ;)\n. Fixed in d09953c4a1ab8ee49c211b472fd9d03f0859932a.\nLanding ;)\n. Fixed in 1.0.0.\nGive me your feedback ;)\n. Fixed in 1.0.0.\n. Maybe this?\nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo#remove-expired-sessions\n.

No compatibility issue!\nIt's just a mongodb optional dependency which fail to build...\nAs it's not directly related to connect-mongo, if you want (and you should) to improve that output, please warn mongodb package maintainers.\n. Can you eventually add a small test for the existence of this.db?\n. Any idea?\n. Hi,\nThe MongoStore emits some events: at least set, touch, destroy. It's more appropriate than your workaround ;)\nBut it could be useful to know when a session ID is persisted for the first time.\nThe rawResponse returned by the upsert may help in this case. We must investigate.\n. @james-s-turner Session creation hook has been added.\n. autoRemove: false.\nThen you can define your own cleanup tasks.\nYou just have to query the session collection with { expires: { $lt: new Date() } }.\nIf you find an elegant and efficient way to collect expiring session ids, I'll be happy to accept your PR.\n. Yes of course. I've updated the README.md.\n. ?\n. TingoDB is not officially supported by connect-mongo.\nIf someone want to fix that, I'll be happy to accept a PR.\n. Yes!\n. Ok thx!\n. Can you just explain why it produces a different behavior?\nThx!\n. Published as v1.2.1.

    "aroman": "Alright, I've just done my own fair bit of research into this issue. Here's where things stand, as I gather:\n- session.cookie.expires is by default null, however, because connect defaults cookie.maxAge (which in turn sets cookie._expires) to null. (See connect's session docs: http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/session.html)\n- connect-mongo only cares about session.expires (that is, session.cookie._expires) when identifying sessions to remove. This is the query: self.collection.remove({expires: {$lte: new Date()}});\n- this means that connect-mongo will simply IGNORE any sessions that have a null maxAge/expires. This is the _wrong behavior. null maxAge/expires cookies should be treated, according to the IETF and connect itself, as a  browser-session cookie. That is, when the user closes the browser the cookie (and session) will be removed.\nSo, why does connect-mongo have this problem? (Or, how do other session store implementations deal with this?)\nWell, connect-redis uses redis's built-in TTL option. So redis itself handles the deletion of old sessions. If they're null, connect-redis defaults to a one-day expiration. (Source)\nConnect's internal (and default) MemoryStore only seems to delete expired sessions when the session is requested (i.e in MemoryStore.prototype.get). If they're null, MemoryStore will always return them and never return them. (Source)\nBasically, there is no consistency between the major SessionStore implementations about what to do here. Additionally, I don't think it's clear in the readme that \"clear_interval\" only determines when things that are externally marked as expired are removed, rather than being the TTL for sessions themselves. Maybe that was just my understanding of it, though.\nI propose that we mirror connect-redis's implementation. Specfically, we should use mongodb 2.2's new TTL feature, which was designed for this sort of use case. I think it might also be sensible to set a one-day expiration if maxAge/expires is null, though frankly, I don't understand the rationale behind that fully.\nI'd appreciate some feedback about this, particularly to hear what your original intended behavior was, @kcbanner. I'd be happy to write up a pull-request if people are in favor.\n. Woohoo! Thanks!\n\n. Just noticed the Travis build failed... it was running the test suite and tried to connect to a mongodb instance on the localhost, which obviously doesn't exist. How have you been running the test suite on travis such that it passes (as master does now?)\n. Great! I managed to fix the travis build -- looks like you need to explicitly add monogdb as a service in the travis config file. Build is passing happily now! :)\n. At what point in the lifecycle of your app are you seeing this? At startup? When new sessions are created? I can't seem to reproduce this on 10.0.1 over here.\n. ^ how is that true?

Great, thanks for the update\n. @lukaszfiszer It's not :) When you pass that option, the driver will create a newDb` object in the background. Instead I'm recommending for the driver to use the already established connection (see my original message).\n. I'll test it out later and re-open this issue if it doesn't work :)\nThank you\n.

When I then look in my database I see the following entry:\n{\n    \"_id\": \"pLPujgL7IgCKdiOJ5cvoLqAF\",\n    \"session\": {\n        \"cookie\": {\n            \"originalMaxAge\": 1209600000,\n            \"expires\": {\n                \"$date\": \"2013-09-29T20:35:17.731Z\"\n            },\n            \"secure\": null,\n            \"httpOnly\": true,\n            \"domain\": null,\n            \"path\": \"/\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"expires\": {\n        \"$date\": \"2013-09-29T20:35:17.731Z\"\n    }\n}\nThe / route does not create a session itself, so this is connect-mongo's work.\n. @kcbanner, that's what I thought too. However, as mentioned the collection is empty when I run the server. The route / does not put anything into the session.\n. FYI, the following code is enough to replicate the problem with an empty collection:\n```\nvar\n  express     = require(\"express\"),\n  mongoose    = require(\"mongoose\"),\n  MongoStore  = require(\"connect-mongo\")(express),\n  config      = require(process.cwd() + \"/src/config\");\nexports.run = function() {\n//create a new HTTP server\n  var server = express();\n//sessions\n  server.use(express.cookieParser(config.sessions.secret));\n  server.use(express.session({\n    secret: config.sessions.secret,\n    key: config.sessions.key,\n    proxy: true,\n    cookie: {maxAge: config.sessions.maxAge, signed: true},\n    store: new MongoStore({\n      mongoose_connection: mongoose.connections[0],\n      stringify: false\n    }, onStoreSetup)})\n  );\nserver.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n    server.send(\"hi there.. you will never see me because I will throw and exit.. :( \");\n  });\n//listen for incoming connections once session store is setup\n  function onStoreSetup() {\n    server.listen(config.http.port);\n  }\n};\n``\n. I'm glad you're looking into it. Tell me if you need more information.\n. @kcbanner  in that case, maybe you can update the NPM repo?\n. @kcbanner It's still on 0.3.3 :)\n. +1\n. Great, thanks for the update\n. @lukaszfiszer It's not :) When you pass that option, the driver will create a newDb` object in the background. Instead I'm recommending for the driver to use the already established connection (see my original message).\n. I'll test it out later and re-open this issue if it doesn't work :)\nThank you\n. ",

Since autoReconnect is by default true, the ensureIndex command gets queued up (more accurately it's the getIndexes command before ensureIndex that is used to prevent duplciates) and so it \"fails\" silently by design. \nCore issue\nIt seems that the reconnect is not working properly with mongoose queued commands so they ultimately aren't executed (related issue,mongoose side) so we can randomly end up in a stale state depending on whether the mongoose connection was opened before MongoStore initializes (for most of my cases it's not).\nFirst Workaround Attempt\nSimply ensure mongoose is either connected first by using\njavascript\nmongoose.connect(\"localhost\", \"test\", function(err){\n /*initialize MongoStore here...*/\n});\nFinal workaround\nFirst attempt didn't work for me since in my setup the MongoStore is initialized in app.configure and I don't want mongoose.connect placed there so what I end up is just pass in static parameters for MongoStore to connect on its own\n``` javascript\nvar dbConfig = {\n \"db\": \"test\",\n \"host\": \"localhost\"\n}\napp.use(express.session({ \n secret: server_session_key\n , store: new MongoStore(dbConfig)\n}));\n```\nThere are probably better ways, but the root problem is more related to mongoose and mongodb driver which is already tracked by others. Need to move on now.\nHope this helps. \n. @malixsys & @LinusU \nI haven't had issues since 7 months from my last post about the workaround. But back then I observed that mongod startup does take a while only on windows' system after the system crashed and mongo was scanning through its journals, so this effect was observed more when I had pre-populated test data in my mongodb since the journals would be larger. Also I use replica sets so it takes a while for start up sometimes too. Therefore, creating the situation where it has to wait a bit longer, even just a few seconds. \nAnyways I realized my lines of code references in my previous post are outdated. I see in the updated code that it checks for db.openCalled before going into the ensureIndex region. However, db.openCalled only indicates that db.open() is called but not state is connected (source code from node-mongodb-native) .\nI dont have the time to dive in this longer again, but perhaps it's better to check that the connection object's connected property is true instead. \nNote: this is based on my very initial read of the connect-mongo and node-mongodb-native code, haven't had time to test it out in runtime to see whether it is accessible. I just thought to give some input again since I realized how many others are interested in this issue.\n. I had similar issues whilst using mongoose connections and I did a bit of tracing all the way into the mongodb driver module so I just want to give some input to this.\nOriginal app.js setup:\njavascript\nmongoose.connect(\"localhost\", \"test\");\n...\napp.configure(function(){\n  /* more config here...*/\n  app.use(express.session({ \n    secret: \"server_session_key\"\n    , store: new MongoStore({db: mongoose.connection.db })\n  }));\n})\n...\n// Start server\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function() {\n  console.log(\"Express server listening on port \" + app.get('port'));\n});\nProblem with that is when MongoStore tries to perform ensureIndex in its constructor, mongoose is still in opening state. Since autoReconnect is by default true, the ensureIndex command gets queued up (more accurately it's the getIndexes command before ensureIndex that is used to prevent duplciates) and so it \"fails\" silently by design. \nCore issue\nIt seems that the reconnect is not working properly with mongoose queued commands so they ultimately aren't executed (related issue,mongoose side) so we can randomly end up in a stale state depending on whether the mongoose connection was opened before MongoStore initializes (for most of my cases it's not).\nFirst Workaround Attempt\nSimply ensure mongoose is either connected first by using\njavascript\nmongoose.connect(\"localhost\", \"test\", function(err){\n /*initialize MongoStore here...*/\n});\nFinal workaround\nFirst attempt didn't work for me since in my setup the MongoStore is initialized in app.configure and I don't want mongoose.connect placed there so what I end up is just pass in static parameters for MongoStore to connect on its own\n``` javascript\nvar dbConfig = {\n \"db\": \"test\",\n \"host\": \"localhost\"\n}\napp.use(express.session({ \n secret: server_session_key\n , store: new MongoStore(dbConfig)\n}));\n```\nThere are probably better ways, but the root problem is more related to mongoose and mongodb driver which is already tracked by others. Need to move on now.\nHope this helps. \n. @malixsys & @LinusU \nI haven't had issues since 7 months from my last post about the workaround. But back then I observed that mongod startup does take a while only on windows' system after the system crashed and mongo was scanning through its journals, so this effect was observed more when I had pre-populated test data in my mongodb since the journals would be larger. Also I use replica sets so it takes a while for start up sometimes too. Therefore, creating the situation where it has to wait a bit longer, even just a few seconds. \nAnyways I realized my lines of code references in my previous post are outdated. I see in the updated code that it checks for db.openCalled before going into the ensureIndex region. However, db.openCalled only indicates that db.open() is called but not state is connected (source code from node-mongodb-native) .\nI dont have the time to dive in this longer again, but perhaps it's better to check that the connection object's connected property is true instead. \nNote: this is based on my very initial read of the connect-mongo and node-mongodb-native code, haven't had time to test it out in runtime to see whether it is accessible. I just thought to give some input again since I realized how many others are interested in this issue.\n. ",

But in the case of Connect, maybe it could be relevant to check when dealing with the same session, with 2 different domains, we could play with nested object in this way :\nvar sess = req.session;\nsession.mydomain1 = {data:....}\nsession.mydomain2 = {data:....} \nand not erased anything ?\n. but in common cases, one user will make one request at a time (on each domain) and session will be flushed after all request ? or maybe I am wrong again, interesting subject ;)\n. 100% agree but if @kevinprotoss purpose is only to keep user connexion it could be fine, then if it is to store real state objects, maybe it could handle it on client side with a client storage solution, it really depends on context but your are right again, no guarantee.\n. hi try this patch https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo/pull/93\n. hi @Immuzov I have not checked what is going on for a while, but can you give some details, does it kill node process at the end ?\n. eheh noob we are ;) nice to get your feedback\n.

Hi @jdesboeufs ,\nMy connect-mongo version seems '0.4.2'. It didn't return any exception. My MongoDB runs on a EC2. Sometimes I can login at two times, seldom three times. If I don't have connect-mongo (when I remove store: parameter) I can login at first try.\n. Thanks @jdesboeufs,\nAfter I've read your response now me too use 0.5.2 . But it works same incorrectly. At my first attempt, my authentication values ( username, pass etc. ) is recorded to session collection. But other routers don't know req.session information. They return \"undefined\" for session value. At my second attempt, the all routers know req.session.\nI couldn't figure out.\n. @jdesboeufs  I found! \nIt's my fault! :cry: \nI use two queries to authenticate a user.

For those who can be interested, I've implemented this feature with ouathtoken and passport with this piece of code:\n```\nexports.requiresRemoveOldSession = function (req, res, next) {\n    log.info('Into requiresRemoveOldSession');\n    var userId = req.user ? req.user.id : undefined;\n    if (!userId) {\n        log.info('No user found in req. Exiting');\n        return next();\n    }\n    log.info('Remove all existing sessions of userId \"%s\" but not the session with id \"%s\"', userId, req.sessionID);\n    var store = req.sessionStore;\n    //    log.info('store.db is \"%s\"', dbg(store.db));\n    var sessionsColl = store.db.collection('sessions');\n    var oauthTokenColl = store.db.collection('oauthtokens');\n    //    log.info('collection is \"%s\"', dbg(sessionsColl));\n    // check all oauthtokens in the header to delete it\n    var authorization = req.headers.authorization;\n    if (authorization) {\n        var bearer = authorization.split(' ')[1];\n        log.info('Removes all oAuthTokens but not this one \"%s\"', bearer);\n        oauthTokenColl.remove({\n            'accountId': req.user.email,\n            'type': 'AccessToken',\n            'token': {\n                '$ne': bearer\n            }\n        }, function (err, nbDeleted) {\n            if (err) log.error('Cannot remove oAuthTokens cause \"%s\"', err);\n            else log.info('We have removed \"%d\" access tokens from oAuthTokens', nbDeleted);\n        });\n    } else {\n        log.info('Removes all oAuthTokens');\n        oauthTokenColl.remove({\n            'accountId': req.user.email,\n            'type': 'AccessToken'\n        }, function (err, nbDeleted) {\n            if (err) log.error('Cannot remove oAuthTokens cause \"%s\"', err);\n            else log.info('We have removed \"%d\" access tokens from oAuthTokens', nbDeleted);\n        });\n    }\nlog.info('Req.headers=\"%s\"', dbg(req.headers));\nsessionsColl.find({\n    'session.passport.user': userId,\n    '_id': {\n        '$ne': req.sessionID\n    }\n}, { _id : 1 }).toArray(function (err, userSessions) {\n    log.info('UserSessions to remove are \"%s\"', dbg(userSessions));\n    _.forEach(userSessions, function (userSession) {\n        log.info('We will remove session \"%s\"', dbg(userSession));\n        store.destroy(userSession._id, function (err) {\n            if (err) log.error('Cannot remove session \"%s\" cause \"%s\"', userSession._id, err);\n            else log.info('Session \"%s\" removed successfully', userSession._id);\n        });\n    });\n    next();\n});\n\n};\n```\nOf course you will need to adapt this to your case.\nI hope this help !\nJM.\n.

I have a similar need. connect-mongo doesn't spontaneously emit an event when a session expires; the get(sid, callback) function in the public API is called to check the session validity.
