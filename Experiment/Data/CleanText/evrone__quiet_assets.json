I think we need to leave this checking, because of assets always mounted on /assets_prefix (even if assets.prefix has no preceding \"/\"). So if we remove that checking then /users/assets/somepath matched too. Could you fix ASSETS_PREFIX instead of this?\n. Well I meant @thenoseman could you send PR for fixing ASSETS_PREFIX in my code? Thanks ;)\n. Hi I've tried to find this bug, but I haven't found it, can you provide gem versions and maybe one short test?\n. In README I pointed out that this gem should be in section development. Did you place it there? It might decide your problems. But I'm still interested about collisions with rack/test.\n. @aaronchi could you provide more information about your environment and one failing test. I cannot replay this issue. Thanks.\n. Any news here? Can someone provides an app to reproduce this issue?\n. I have no idea how it can arise in tests because it should be only inside development group in Gemfile. If someone has the same mistakes fell free to reopen this.\n. @asymmetric You had an initializer and quiet_assets in Gemfile at the same time did that cause stack level too deep?\n. By default app.config.assets.prefix is \"/assets\", so in your variant the prefix became \"//assets/\". We need to use something like this split(\"/\").delete_if(&:empty?).join(\"/\") for parsing prefix, this should cover all variants.\n. And please, could you squash these commits into one?\n. Sorry but I cannot accept your PR yet. The problem that I've explained above (https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets/pull/5#issuecomment-5219529) is still here. When prefix starts with / (and by default it is so) in your fix it become //.\n. Well I think it is not so bad if you are using relative paths, because of sprockets connect to rails by:\napp.routes.prepend do\n  mount app.assets => config.assets.prefix\nend\nAnd it anyway will be mounted on /prefix even if the prefix was relative.\nBut I also think we need to check both variants. I'm waiting for your fixes. Thanks ;)\n. Thank you, I've merged PR with a bit fixes.\n. Thank you @shingara \n. Thanks @nolamesa \n. Thanks for reporting, I'll take a look today.\n. I think group :develop in your Gemfile might be a cause. By default rails require :default, :development groups. I'm not sure that your group :develop loaded at all but I didn't setup your project.\n. You can place gem 'quiet_assets' without any group and if it works fine than close this issue because the problem not here.\n. Yes that might be the cause\n. It works perfect for me because it's not related to any server. Which commands do you run?\n. @vighnesh1987 So you run unicorn_rails and you still see entries in log/development.log?\n. @vighnesh1987 It's still working for me anyway. What kind of logs are you talking about? Is it development.log? Could you reproduce this bug in a small empty rails project and share that code with us?\n. @vighnesh1987 ping! Let me investigate this issue I need more detailed explanation.\n. Thanks @theinventor I'll take a look!\n. At last I found time to check that project and this issue out, guys this gem takes care only about Rails logs, I mean tail -f log/development.log and etc, it doesn't pay attention to server you're using. @theinventor thanks for sample, closing this!\n. Thanks @jordanglassman Feels like you wanna filter entries that isn't related to assets, isn't it?\n. Sorry for the delay, actually I have my doubts about it. This gem for swallowing assets' log entries in development and it's not recommended to use it in production, because it monkeypatches the rails. I'll ask opinions of @evrone.\n. Ok, I kinda agree to merge it, but if we can leave just one option config.quiet_assets. What do you say?\n. Sorry for long delay again @jordanglassman, I tried to implement my idea to use just one option that by default had to contain lambda for assets log silencing, but I faced the problem, it cannot be implemented. So I tend to close it just for one reason - people don't want to see assets log in their development cycle and nothing more. Thanks for your work anyway!\n. Thanks @banyan\n. I don't think we should do something with this, it's a webrick's issue.\nI saw that warning for a long time, I saw Aaron's patch https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/attachments/2300/204_304_keep_alive.patch that he had released on 12/10/2011.\nI want to see it fixed but I have no idea why it's still not fixed.\nYou can try to use @steveklabnik solution that he left here https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7469 or use another web server.\n. Closing this\n. Oh thanks a lot!\n. @seantan Thanks for the info I'll take a look!\n. I have an idea about this mistake. @seantan can you participate in it? I've created a branch using_middleware could you run your application and check it works properly?\n. Never mind my previous comment, seems like some parts won't work for rails 4\n. Yes it works for 3.2 but there are diffs in logger implementation between rails versions. Thinking about realization now...\n. @pierre-pretorius have you tried to use QA from master branch?\n. Ok got it, will take a look. Maybe @dima-exe has something to say?\n. This gem has dependency on railtie, but I can't realize what you're talking about. So explain it in details please.\n. No activity, closing\n. Agree! I'll do it very soon!\n. I know I know guys, there's a little bit work to be done before release\n. Done guys, sorry for the delay.\n. Thank you Nick, I'll merge it after typo fixes\n. @avk I can't reproduce this, could you create a repo with test application reproducing this bug?\n. Well it actually does something with it, I think it can be possible. I'd appriciate a test application.\n. @tomav it's not Rails log you see in the latest output. These requests are all from puma whereas rails and especially QA are beyond the server and don't have ability to affect Puma.\n. Well it doesn't look like asset pipeline image, it probably was generated by paperclip or carrierwave.\n. closing\n. Thank you!\n. Hi @qichunren Does it work for you with 1.5 thin and problem only with 2.0?\n. @darioshanghai as you can see from travis-ci it works for 2.0 so I need additional info, please open a new issue.\n. @qichunren since this issue for thin version pre it's in a low priority so go ahead to fix it or I'll take a look when I find time.\n. Oh thanks it makes me happy :) Unfortunately closing this :)\n. From README:\nIt is recommended that this gem only be used for development. To install, add this line to development group in your Gemfile:\ngem 'quiet_assets', :group => :development\nSo QA should not be used in test env.\n. They shouldn't be cropped. If QA is only in development group in your Gemfile then it mustn't be loaded in test environment at all. Could you please provide a portion of your logs? It can give me idea of what's going on.\n. ASSETS_PREFIX is just a string not a regexp and we don't consider it as a collection of paths.\n. There's an ability now on master branch\n. You can use it in production indeed, but the only reason I thought of was the way it's implemented too tricky with alias_method_chain, so it looks like monkey patching. Anyway, on production, assets should be picked up by nginx or another web server and asset's log entries should not appear in production log. I'm not sure should it be in README file?\n. Ok will change the description. Thanks!\n. Great, thank you so much!\n. Looks good to me\n. I'm going to merge this. Please rebase onto master.\n. Sorry for a long delay\n. I'm gonna check why it segfaults and merge it. Thank you\n. Merged! Thanks again!\n. Where is this log from? I'm not sure what the cache: at the beginning means.\n. Well I don't think it's the real requests, some output from rack-cache or so... Is this happening on every request?\n. No answer, no issue :)\n. It's already in. We just have to release new version.\n. All the rest looks good to me :+1: \n. I'm not that fast :) Thanks again!\n. Not yet. I have a plan to change the way we currently make it working on another, and then I'll release.\n. This documentation is for master branch. I haven't released the gem yet. If you wanna use master add this to your gem file: gem 'quiet_assets' github: 'evrone/quiet_assets'\n. Done\n. Thanks for the report I'll take care\n. Guys you don't even know how cool you are, I'm short on time for now, thanks!\n. Thx, closing\n. Thanks a lot :)\n. Thank you Nicolas!\n. Guys I use myself same environment, everything is k. Provide sample application which reproduces the issue\n. Like I said in a previous thread I use it myself, no probs. Give me reproducible app and I'll work it out\n. It shouldn't be used in tests\n. Thank you @rossbeale! I think we can drop legacy.\n. @mibamur it's going to be in Rails 5 if I find time to add tests before release. See https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/pull/338 for 4.2 I gotta check and prepare new release soon.\n. @wbotelhos No reason\n. @overdrivemachines You see \"/\" because it isn't asset path\n. What I'm saying is that in your opened issue you provide a sample of output that has not to be filtered out from the log\n. QA is in rails 5 from now on\n. @nbulaj it's somewhere deep inside sprockets-rails. It should work by default though\n. It's all started here https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/pull/338 follow it\n. Thanks\n. Just take a look around at others PRs and README\n. wat?. @Deekor just throw quiet_assets out of a Gemfile and see Deprecation line in the README. This all left me in a wordless dumb state. Just brilliant.. Thank you @chip \n. Thank you for your PR @thenoseman.
